    "black hole demographics has become a common and important ingredient of cosmological studies in recent years .",
    "one reason is the indication that black holes and their activity play a crucial role in the formation and evolution of galaxies (  granato  2004 ; springel , di matteo , & hernquist 2005 ; somerville  2008 ) and galaxy clusters (  mcnamara & nulsen 2007 ) . to fully understand the impact of black holes on mass structures and their evolution we need to understand much better how they form , grow , and interact with their surroundings .",
    "a first step toward this goal is to take inventory of the population of supermassive black holes across the history of the universe .",
    "unfortunately , it is not possible to study supermassive black holes in all types of galaxies with the same ( mass estimation ) method (  cf .",
    "magorrian  1998 ; vestergaard 2004b , 2009 ; peterson  2004 ) , due to the varying physical conditions of their host galaxies , the varying activity level of the black holes themselves , and the large range of physical distances to the black hole host galaxies . due to their faintness and the small angular extent of the central region that needs to be studied , quiescent or weakly active black holes can typically not be well studied beyond the local neighborhood of a few hundred mpc (  ferrarese 2003 ) . since actively accreting black holes power the luminous quasars that are observable across the universe (  fan 2006 ) , quasars offers a convenient way to trace the black hole population in the distant universe .",
    "the goal is that the combination of studies of active black holes with empirical and theoretical insight on the relationship between active and quiescent black holes and between obscured and unobscured black holes will eventually lead to realistic representations of the true and complete black hole population .",
    "we can study the population of actively accreting supermassive black holes by studying the large catalogs of quasars and active galaxies obtained through the numerous large , extensive quasar and agn uv and optical surveys that have been made since the discovery of quasars [   the multi - color survey of stellar objects by koo & kron ( 1982 ) , palomar - green survey ( schmidt & green 1983 ) , uk - schmidt telescope survey (  kibblewhite  1984 ; hewett  2001 ) , canada - france - hawaii telescope survey ( crampton , cowley , & hartwick 1987 ) , cfa redshift survey ( huchra & burg 1992 ) , palomar transit grism survey ( schmidt , schneider , & gunn 1995 ) , 2-degree - field survey ( 2df ; smith  2005 ) , and sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york  2000 ) ] .",
    "notably , any survey with its own set of selection criteria will tend to preferentially select either for or against objects with particular spectral or broad band properties .",
    "therefore , by studying only quasars studied by a single selection method there is a risk that we may limit ourselves to only part of the actual underlying black hole population .",
    "we aim to minimize this potential issue by including in our ongoing study of the black hole population and the black hole mass functions several quasar samples .",
    "the current work focuses on the mass functions based on the following samples : the bright quasar survey ( bqs ;  schmidt & green 1983 ) , the large bright quasar survey ( lbqs ;  hewett , foltz , & chaffee 1995 ) , and the color - selected sample from the fall equatorial stripe ( fan  2001a ) of the sdss .",
    "the bqs , lbqs , and the sdss color - selected samples are each based on different selection criteria , namely uv excess , spectral shape on objective prism plates , and broad - band colors , respectively .",
    "especially , the bqs and the lbqs are each complementary to the sdss dr3 quasar selection ( richards  2002 ) .",
    "for example , the sdss selection probability decreases significantly for quasars at redshifts of about 2.8 to 3.2 because the colors of quasars at these redshifts coincide with the stellar locus in the selected color spaces ( richards  2006 ) .",
    "this limits the usefulness of the dr3 quasar black hole mass function ( vestergaard  2008 ) at and near this redshift range which is particularly important since this is the epoch at which the quasar space density peaks (  osmer 1982 ; warren , hewett , & osmer 1994 ; schmidt  1995 ; fan  2001a , 2001b ) .",
    "the different selection criterion of the lbqs can instead help shed light on the mass distribution at the affected redshift range , especially given the large size of this quasar sample ( 1067 quasars ) and its wide redshift range .",
    "the favorable properties of the somewhat smaller bqs sample are that it is selected over a very large sky area ( 10700 square degrees ) and includes the brightest quasars in the nearby universe .",
    "therefore , the bqs is suitable for anchoring the bright end of the luminosity function and the high mass end of the black hole mass function in the nearby universe",
    ". also , the colors of the bqs quasars are not typical of sdss quasars ( jester  2005 ) and the bqs thus makes a different contribution to our insight on black hole mass distribution than the sdss alone can provide .",
    "the value of the sdss color - selected sample studied here is that it is a well - defined , complete ( to within the color - selection criteria , the survey area , and the flux density limits ) and homogeneous quasar sample at redshift 3.6@xmath95.0 that is highly suitable for statistical studies .",
    "this redshift range is beyond that of the lbqs ( @xmath103.0 for the mass functions ) and is where the number statistics of the sdss dr3 mass function quasar sample is lower .",
    "the availability of a well - defined selection function for this color - selected sample ( fan  2001a ) therefore gives us an excellent opportunity to determine the black hole mass function for a homogeneous and well - defined sample at high redshift which thus renders an additional opportunity for constraining the black hole mass distribution at earlier epochs .",
    "the added values of the samples studied here are that luminosity functions have been determined for both the lbqs (  boyle  2000 ) and the sdss color - selected samples ( fan  2001a ) .",
    "potentially , by combining the luminosity and black hole mass functions for the same quasar samples we can break the degeneracies ( related in part to the unknown mass dependency of the radiative efficiency and mass accretion rate ) that limit the use of the luminosity functions alone (  wyithe & radmanabhan 2006 ) . by combining the three quasar samples studied here with the sdss dr3 quasar sample for which the luminosity and mass functions have already been determined ( richards  2006 ; vestergaard  2008 ) we anticipate to gain a better understanding of the true underlying black hole mass distribution than is possible by studying either of these samples alone .    in this work we present the black hole",
    "mass functions of the bqs , lbqs , and the sdss color - selected quasar samples which collectively cover the entire redshift range up to @xmath11 and contain nearly 1200 sources .",
    "we adopt the most recently calibrated mass scaling relations utilizing broad line widths and continuum luminosities (  vestergaard & peterson 2006 ; vestergaard  2008 and references therein ) in cases where the more robust reverberation mapping mass determinations ( peterson  2004 ) are not available .",
    "although the mass estimates based on scaling relations are less robust than the reverberation mapping masses and are potentially prone to systematic uncertainties (  krolik 2001 ; richards  2002 ; vestergaard 2004a , 2004b , 2009 ) they perform surprisingly well considering the circumstances (  vestergaard 2004b , 2009 ; vestergaard & peterson 2006 ; marconi  2008 ) .",
    "in fact , there is suggestive evidence based on h@xmath8 data that scaling relations can be improved to yield mass estimates that are within a factor 1.6 ( or 0.2dex ) of the reverberation masses when radiation pressure on the broad line gas is taken into account ( marconi  2008 ) .",
    "this uncertainty rivals the scatter of the quiescent black holes in the m_bh @xmath1@xmath12 relationship ( @xmath13dex ; tremaine  2002 ) .",
    "source inclination is known to affect the velocity dispersion of the broad line region as measured using the widths of broad optical and uv emission lines (  wills & browne 1986 ; vestergaard , wilkes , & barthel 2000 ) .",
    "in fact , source inclination is expected to be one of the factors that account for at least part of the scatter in the m_bh @xmath1 values around the m_bh @xmath1@xmath12 relationship ( although the inclination is not trivially connected to object location relative to the m_bh @xmath1@xmath12 relationship ;  collin  2006 ) and which at present limits the accuracy of mass determinations of active black holes to some degree .",
    "considerations have also been made on the relative usefulness of the various line widths (  the line dispersion versus the fwhm width ) (  peterson  2004 ; denney  2008 ) and a correction scheme was suggested ( collin  2006 ) to correct mass estimates based on fwhm measurements of h@xmath8 to mass estimates based on the line dispersion values which are preferred for the high - quality reverberation mapping database ( peterson  2004 ) .",
    "unfortunately , for neither of these effects ( radiation pressure , inclination , and the potential inadequacies of the fwhm parameter ) are the influences on our determination of black hole masses understood or parametrized well enough that corrections can be applied to our mass estimates for all three emission lines , h@xmath8 , mgii , and civ , used here .",
    "also , for this study we need our entire data base to be coherent and homogeneously analyzed and all mass estimates to be based on similar assumptions .",
    "for these reasons , we make no attempt to correct the mass estimates at this time .",
    "the mass functions presented here will be analyzed further in relation to the black hole mass functions of the sdss dr3 quasar sample ( vestergaard  2008 ) for the purpose of extracting the true underlying mass distribution using the statistical methods introduced and discussed for the luminosity function by kelly , fan , & vestergaard ( 2008a ) and for the mass function by kelly , vestergaard & fan ( 2009 ) .",
    "if , at that time , we are capable of making corrections for any of the effects outlined earlier such that the mass estimates or the associated error distribution change significantly , the mass functions will be updated accordingly .",
    "a cosmology of h@xmath14 = 70 @xmath15 , @xmath16 = 0.7 , and @xmath17 = 0.3 is used throughout .",
    "the three quasar samples for which we determine the black hole mass functions are summarized in the following sections , in order of their redshift coverage . as outlined in section  3 , the black hole mass estimates",
    "are based on measurements of the widths of the h@xmath8 , mgii , and civ profiles and nuclear continuum luminosities .",
    "these spectral measurements are therefore also summarized in the following .",
    "the bright quasar survey ( bqs ; schmidt & green 1983 ) is a subset of the quasars discovered in the palomar - green survey of uv excess sources ( @xmath18 ; green , schmidt , & liebert 1986 ) undertaken in 1973 @xmath19 1974 using the 18 inch palomar schmidt telescope with classification spectroscopy obtained with the hale 5 m telescope .",
    "this survey was done using photographic @xmath20 plates that were later digitized .",
    "it has an impressive area coverage of 10714 deg@xmath21 and a flux limit of about @xmath22 mag . here",
    ", we include the 87 objects at @xmath10 0.5 for which boroson & green ( 1992 ) present spectroscopic data .",
    "we use the spectral measurements (  line widths and continuum luminosities ) adopted by vestergaard & peterson ( 2006 ) where the details of the data are also described .    the mass distribution of the bqs sample was previously studied by vestergaard ( 2004a ) .",
    "since that work , the mass scaling relationships have been updated owing to improvements made to the reverberation mapping database ( peterson  2004 ) .",
    "therefore , for the few bqs quasars for which robust black hole mass measurements have been obtained using reverberation mapping ( peterson  2004 ) , we adopt these mass determinations in our analysis with exception of pg2130@xmath23099 for which the mass has recently been further improved ( grier  2008 ) . for the remaining sources we adopt the mass estimates based on the most recently updated mass scaling relationships .",
    "these mass values are listed in table  7 of vestergaard & peterson ( 2006 ) .",
    "the large bright quasar survey ( lbqs ;  foltz  1987 ; hewett  2001 ) is the largest published spectroscopic survey of optically selected quasars at bright ( @xmath24 mag ) apparent magnitudes as of 1995 .",
    "it consists of 1067 quasars located at redshifts between 0.2 and 3.4 and it covers an effective area of 453.8 deg@xmath21 on the sky .",
    "the quasar candidates were selected from the automated plate measuring machine scans of the united kingdom schmidt telescope direct and objective - prism plates based on their spectral energy distribution shapes on these plates .",
    "the details of the survey are published in a series of papers and most recently summarized by hewett  ( 2001 ) who also present an updated account of the survey completeness as a function of redshift .",
    "spectroscopic observations were obtained in the late 1980 s at a resolution of 6 @xmath19 10 using the 4.5 m multi mirror telescope ( mmt ) with a wavelength range of @xmath25@xmath253300 @xmath19 7500 or with the las campanas 2.5 m du pont telescope with a wavelength range of @xmath25@xmath253400 @xmath19 7000 ( morris  1991 ) . in these configurations the h@xmath8 , mgii , and civ emission lines are observed in the spectra of quasars at redshifts between 0.2 to about 0.4 @xmath19 0.5 , between 0.2 to 1.5 @xmath19 1.65 , and between 1.2 @xmath19 1.26 to a redshift of about 3.4 , respectively .",
    "the presence of two different spectral wavelength ranges should not affect our results since each spectrum will contain at least one of the h@xmath8 , mgii , and civ emission lines for the redshift range from 0.2 to 3.0 .",
    "forster  ( 2001 ) performed automated spectral modeling of the lbqs spectra and , in particular , present line width measurements for 993 of the 1067 quasars of the full lbqs sample .",
    "the remaining quasars were not modeled because of strong broad and narrow absorption in the ly @xmath26 and civ emission lines .",
    "the spectra were modeled with a powerlaw continuum component , uv and optical feii emission templates ( vestergaard & wilkes 2001 ; boroson & green 1992 ) , and gaussian emission and absorption line functions .",
    "most of the broad emission lines were modeled with a single gaussian profile from which the fwhm was obtained .",
    "a small fraction of the spectra are of high enough quality to allow two gaussian functions to be fitted to the lines . for the single gaussian models we adopted the measurements of the fwhm and uncertainties tabulated by forster  ( their table  5 ) . to determine the fwhm of the emission lines modeled with multiple gaussian components we first regenerated the modeled line profile from the tabulated model parameters of all the components .",
    "then we measured the fwhm of the regenerated profile ( i.e. , as the full width at the half maximum peak value ) .",
    "the measurement uncertainties of the fwhm in this case were obtained by a suitable weighting of the uncertainties in the tabulated measurements of the individual gaussian components .",
    "these weights were estimated as the weights to be applied to the fwhm measurements of the individual gaussian components so to obtain the fwhm of the sum of the components ( determined from the regenerated line profile , described above ) . for each of the broad emission lines ( h@xmath8 , mgii , civ )",
    "a separate weight was determined .",
    "we note that only a few quasars had emission lines modeled with multiple gaussian components : 7 h@xmath8 , 118 mgii , and 79 civ lines , respectively ( out of a total of 148 h@xmath8 , 677 mgii , and 488 civ profiles , respectively ) .",
    "for profiles for which forster  fixed the line width ( no uncertainties were estimated ) we adopt a typical measurement error of 10% (  brotherton 1996 ) .    because the lbqs spectra are not flux calibrated , we determined the nuclear monochromatic continuum luminosities not from the spectra but from the survey @xmath20 magnitudes .",
    "given the modest quality of the spectra we visually inspected the spectra of quasars with fwhm measurements listed by forster  to be either below 2000 ^-1 kms@xmath27 or above 12,000 ^-1 kms@xmath27 .",
    "the reason is that very small and very large line widths measurements are more prone to be spurious in spectra of modest quality and they can significantly affect the mass functions owing to the relatively smaller number of such extreme objects . the fact that the forster  profile measurements above 12,000 ^-1 kms@xmath27 tend to have large uncertainties confirm our general suspicion .",
    "most of the very broad line profile fits of forster  are typically listed for profiles of quite poor quality ( with a few having strong absorption in addition ) ; in a couple of cases , the fitting must have gone bad .",
    "we found all civ profiles with fwhm @xmath28 17,000 ^ -1 kms@xmath27 had to be discarded for these reasons and a few profiles of about 12,500 @xmath19 14,000 ^ -1 kms@xmath27 have too noisy profiles to be useful .",
    "in addition , most of the mgii fwhm measurements listed to be above 12,000 ^ -1 kms@xmath27 are based on very noisy , unreliable data ; these measurements were discarded from further analysis . for the profiles listed to have fwhm @xmath29 2000 ^ -1 kms@xmath27 , we find that for some of the h@xmath8 and mgii profiles the single ( or the second ) gaussian component was fitted to noise spikes or what appears to be a strong contribution from the narrow line region ( judging from the strength of the [ oiii ] @xmath255007 line , when available ) which gives the appearance of intrinsically very narrow broad - line profiles . for these profiles , the narrow component was discarded and the broad component alone , if available , was used to characterize the profile . for profiles fitted with only a single gaussian component ,",
    "the emission line was discarded from further analysis .",
    "a total of 6 h@xmath8 and 7 mgii narrow profiles were discarded .",
    "after this filtering of the data with the most uncertain measurements , we are left with measurements of a total of 139 h@xmath8 , 654 mgii , and 480 civ profiles ; a total of 134 quasars have measurements of both h@xmath8 and mgii , while 161 quasars have both mgii and civ measurements . of the original 993 quasars analyzed by forster  we were able to estimate the black hole masses for 978 quasars .",
    "the adopted fwhm values and the continuum luminosities used for the mass estimates are listed in table  [ lbqs_fwl.tab ] .",
    "the black hole masses , bolometric luminosities , and eddington luminosity ratios for the lbqs are listed in table  [ lbqs_ml.tab ] .",
    "table  [ lbqs_lz_missingq.tab ] lists the basic properties ( name , redshift , @xmath20 magnitudes , and luminosity ) of the lbqs quasars without mass estimates .",
    "the determination of the m_bh @xmath1 values are described in section  3 .",
    "fan  ( 2001a ) present a well - defined color - selected sample of 38 quasars at 3.6 @xmath30 5.0 from a 182 deg@xmath21 field in the sdss fall equatorial stripe for which they determine the quasar luminosity function .",
    "the quasars were selected based on @xmath31 and @xmath32 colors to be complete in the survey area down to @xmath33 = 20 mag .",
    "the continuum luminosities measured from the spectra were recalibrated to the dereddened ab(1450 ) magnitudes ( see  vestergaard 2004a ; see fan  2001a for details on these data ) . for four of the 38 quasars we are unable to obtain black hole mass estimates , because the ( discovery ) spectrum did not include the civ emission line ( j021043.17@xmath19001818.4 , j021102.72@xmath19000910.3 , j025019.78@xmath23004650.3 ) or the quality of the spectrum was too poor to measure fwhm(civ ) reasonably reliably ( j020731.68@xmath23010348.9 ) . for quasar j021102.72@xmath19000910.3",
    "another spectrum is available in the sdss archive , but we were unable to reliably measure spectral parameters for the mass estimate from that spectrum .",
    "fan  originally presented 39 quasars in this sample , but one source ( j225529.09@xmath19003433.4 ) has since been reclassified as a star ; the spectrum is also missing from the discovery papers ( fan  2001a ; schneider   2001 ) and the sdss data release 6 archives .",
    "this quasar sample was also included in the study by vestergaard ( 2004a ) on the distributions of black hole mass and eddington luminosity ratios for distant quasars .",
    "since improved mass estimation relations have been published more recently ( vestergaard & peterson 2006 ) , we redetermine the black hole masses for this sample .",
    "we adopt the measurements of fwhm(civ ) and 1350 continuum luminosities obtained and analyzed by vestergaard ( 2004a ) .",
    "the fwhm and continuum luminosity measurements used for the mass estimates of the sdss color - selected sample are listed in table  [ sdss_fwl.tab ] .",
    "the black hole masses , bolometric luminosities , and eddington luminosity ratios for these quasars are listed in table  [ sdss_ml.tab ] .",
    "the computations are described in the next section .",
    "we determine black hole mass estimates using the socalled mass scaling relationships which utilize the widths of the broad emission lines and the nuclear continuum luminosities (  wandel , peterson , & malkan 1999 ; vestergaard 2002 , 2004b , 2009 ; mclure & jarvis 2002 ; warner  2003 ; see also dietrich & hamann 2004 ) .",
    "this method is preferred for several reasons ( see also vestergaard 2009 ) .",
    "only a couple of methods are applicable both to active galaxies in the nearby universe as well as the most distant quasars . of these , mass scaling relationships have some of the lowest associated uncertainties (  vestergaard 2004b ) which can be further improved upon in the future (  marconi  2008 ) . and quite importantly , these relationships are anchored in robust black hole mass determinations of low redshift active nuclei based on the reverberation mapping method (  blandford & mckee 1982 ; peterson 1993 ) which have recently been updated following a homogeneous reanalysis of the available reverberation database ( peterson  2004 ; onken  2004 ) . moreover , the evidence in favor of our application of this method to more distant sources is quite strong ( see  vestergaard 2004b , 2009 , and references therein ) .",
    "black hole mass estimates can be obtained using one or more of the h@xmath8 , mgii , or civ emission lines . for mass estimates based on h@xmath8 and civ",
    "we use equations ( 5 ) and ( 7 ) , respectively , presented by vestergaard & peterson ( 2006 ) ; these relationships are calibrated to the most recently updated robust reverberation mapping mass determinations ( peterson  2004 ; onken  2004 ) . at present , there is no published relationship for the mgii emission line which is ( re)calibrated to the improved reverberation masses and also intercalibrated to the mass estimates based on the civ emission line0.36 and do not include a relation for civ .",
    "we remind the reader that our ultimate intent is to compare and combine the mass functions presented here with those published by vestergaard  ( 2008 ) on the sdss dr3 quasar survey . for this particular purpose",
    "we need to use the _ exact same _ mass estimation relationships for all the individual mass functions . ] .",
    "we therefore obtained a new relationship for mgii using several thousand high - quality spectra from the sdss dr3 quasar sample ( schneider  2005 ) .",
    "this relationship has been applied to the subset of the dr3 quasar sample used to establish the luminosity ( richards  2006 ) and black hole mass ( vestergaard  2008 ) functions . for completeness , we here present the relationships used .",
    "we obtained a relation for each of four monochromatic continuum luminosities because the 3000 luminosity may not always be accurately determined , sitting below the strong feii line emission at those wavelengths .",
    "we use the relation pertaining to the nuclear monochromatic continuum luminosity that can be best and most accurately measured in the observed spectrum .",
    "we refrain from extrapolating or adopting an assumed continuum slope in any of our work . for a given wavelength , @xmath25 , the black hole mass based on mgii",
    "was obtained according to :    @xmath34 ^ 2 \\left[\\frac{\\lambda l_{\\lambda}}{10^{44 } \\,erg / s}\\right]^{0.5}\\ ] ]    where @xmath35 is 6.72 , 6.79 , 6.86 , and 6.96 for @xmath251350 , @xmath252100 , @xmath253000 , and @xmath255100 , respectively .",
    "the 1@xmath36 scatter in the absolute zero - points , @xmath37 , is 0.55dex which includes the factor @xmath42.9 uncertainties of the reverberation mapping masses to which these mass estimation relations are anchored [ see e.g. , vestergaard & peterson ( 2006 ) and onken  ( 2004 ) for details ] . on average , these relations are consistent to within about 0.1dex of the h@xmath8 and civ mass estimates . the relationships will be discussed further in a forthcoming paper ( m.  vestergaard et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "a few of the bqs sources have been targeted by reverberation mapping . for those sources ,",
    "we adopt the reverberation mass listed by peterson   ( 2004 ) .",
    "since the objects in the bqs are all located at @xmath38 we use the h@xmath8 relationship to estimate the black hole mass for the remaining sources in this sample .",
    "those mass estimates are listed in table  7 of vestergaard & peterson ( 2006 ) and by grier  ( 2008 ) for pg2130@xmath23099 .",
    "the quasars in the lbqs span a large range of redshifts and therefore we applied all three emission line relations as follows . for any given source for which the fwhm of any of the three emission lines ( h@xmath8 , mgii , civ ) could be reliably measured we determined an estimate of the mass based on each of these emission lines .",
    "if more than one emission line estimate is available for a given quasar , the final mass estimate of that source was determined as the weighted average of the available individual mass estimates .",
    "the adopted weights are the inverse variance determined from the propagated measurement errors .",
    "therefore , for redshifts between 0.2 and 0.66 the mass estimate for each object is based on both the h@xmath8 and mgii emission lines while for redshifts between 1.04 and 1.71 the mass is based on both the mgii and civ lines .",
    "the black hole mass estimates for the lbqs are listed in table  [ lbqs_ml.tab ] .",
    "the quasars in the sdss color - selected sample all reside at redshifts for which only the civ emission line can be observed using optical spectroscopy .",
    "we therefore use equation ( 7 ) of vestergaard & peterson ( 2006 ) to estimate the black hole masses for this sample .",
    "the mass values are tabulated in table  [ sdss_ml.tab ] .",
    "the distribution of ( bolometric ) luminosities and black hole masses with redshift is shown for all three samples in figures  [ lzfig ] and  [ mlolzfig ] , respectively .",
    "the bolometric luminosities , @xmath39 , are obtained for the lbqs quasars by scaling monochromatic continuum luminosities at 1350 , 2100 , 3000 , and 5100 with a constant ( average ) bolometric correction factor values in addition to those stemming from assuming a constant bolometric correction given that a range of spectral energy distributions exist of quasars (  elvis  1994 ; kuhn  2001 ; richards  2006 ) .",
    "given that a robust adjustment scheme for the bolometric corrections has not been isolated and that the eddington luminosity ratios are not analyzed further here , adopting a more complex correction factor is unnecessary at this time . ]",

    "the @xmath39 value is determined from the monochromatic luminosity that is as closely centered in its optical observing window . for the sdss color - selected sample ,",
    "the 1350 continuum luminosity were similarly corrected for an estimate of the @xmath39 values .",
    "the bqs bolometric luminosities are adopted from sanders  ( 1989 ) with appropriate cosmological corrections applied to conform to the cosmological model used in this work .",
    "figures  [ lzfig ] and  [ mlolzfig ] clearly demonstrate that since we can probe to lower luminosity limits in the nearby universe , we can also probe less massive black holes than at high redshift .",
    "while the bqs spans a large range in masses , it does not go very deep ; recall , the limiting magnitude is @xmath41 16.2 mag .",
    "the lbqs is also a ` bright ' survey but has a lower flux limit ( fig .",

    "this is also clear from the relative distributions of black hole masses at low redshifts for which there is some redshift overlap between the lbqs and the bqs ( fig .",
    "[ mlolzfig ] ) .",
    "the masses of the high-@xmath0 color - selected sample and of the lbqs sources above a redshift of 1 are all of order a billion solar masses .    for completeness",

    "the quasars beyond @xmath43 1 typically have @xmath42 values between @xmath40.1 and @xmath41.0 , while in the nearby universe the surveys can probe sources that accrete at rates down to about 1/100th of the eddington limit .",
    "this distribution is consistent with earlier studies (  warner  2003 ; shemmer  2004 ; mclure & dunlop 2004 ; vestergaard 2004 ; kollmeier  2006 ; shen  2008 ; netzer & traktenbrot 2007 ) and results showing that distant quasars are more actively accreting than local quasars and active nuclei (  peterson  2004 ) . it is important to keep in mind , here , that distant quasars also tend to be more luminous (  figure  [ lzfig ] ) . also , we show the distribution of fwhm of the emission lines with redshift in figure  [ fwzfig ]",
    ". there is no significant change in fwhm with redshift with the exception that the sdss quasars do not have the extreme wide lines that some lbqs quasars do .",
    "the quasar black hole mass function , @xmath44(m_bh @xmath1,@xmath0 ) , is defined as the comoving space density of black holes per unit black hole mass as a function of black hole mass and redshift . to determine the space density (  the number of black holes per unit comoving volume ) in a given mass and redshift bin , we use the 1/@xmath45 method presented by warren , hewett , & osmer ( 1994 ) , where @xmath45 is the accessible volume , defined by avni & bahcall ( 1980 ) . the mass function and its statistical uncertainty",

    "the sum is performed over the objects ( denoted by @xmath47 ) with redshift in the range @xmath48 and @xmath49 and with masses in the range @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "we follow the method of fan  ( 2001a ) and vestergaard  ( 2008 ) of including the selection function of the quasar survey in the computation of the accessible volume :    @xmath52    the `` accessible redshift '' , @xmath53 , is the minimum of @xmath54 , the maximum redshift that object @xmath47 can have and still be detected by the survey , and the upper redshift limit in the survey or in the adopted redshift bin ,  @xmath55 $ ] .",
    "the volume element , @xmath56 , is defined by hogg ( 1999 ) for a @xmath57cdm cosmology .    for the bqs a constant survey completeness of @xmath58 = 0.88 , determined by schmidt & green ( 1983 ) , was adopted . for the lbqs we adopt the survey completeness as a function of redshift presented by hewett  ( 2001 ; their table  7 ) .",
    "the selection function for the sdss color - selected sample was presented by fan  ( 2001a ) and is a function of both luminosity , redshift , and spectral energy distribution , @xmath59 .",
    "we show the black hole mass functions of the three samples as a function of black hole mass in figure  [ mfallfig ] .",
    "we limit the lbqs mass functions to redshifts below 3 since there are only nine quasars between redshifts 3 and 3.4 ; the lbqs mass functions are thus based on 969 quasars at @xmath60 .",
    "the lbqs sample is large enough to allow the mass functions to be determined for a range of redshift bins ; they are shown in whole or in part in the various panels of figure  [ mfallfig ] .",
    "this also allows us to display the mass functions as a function of redshift for a given black hole mass ( figure  [ mfzfig ] ) .",
    "the mass functions for the three quasar samples are tabulated in tables  [ bqs_mf.tab ] , [ lbqs_mf.tab ] , and  [ sdss_mf.tab ] .",
    "table  [ lbqs_mf_zdep.tab ] tabulates the redshift dependent mass function of the lbqs .    for 89 quasars ( or about 8% ) of the complete lbqs sample",
    "there is no spectral modeling available and therefore no black hole mass estimates exist for these sources .",
    "we refer henceforth to this subset as the ` missing subset ' ( figure  [ lmissqfig ] ) .",
    "this affects the mass functions to some degree as we will underestimate the space density of certain black hole masses . in an attempt to estimate the most likely mass function for the entire lbqs sample we have used the observed distribution of black hole masses ( for those quasars with reliable spectral modeling ) to determine for each quasar in the missing subset the most likely black hole mass and the reasonably expected mass range around this value . from the observed distribution of lbqs black hole masses we determined the median mass and the standard deviation @xmath36 around this mass value in bins of @xmath0 and @xmath20 of widths @xmath61 = 0.1 and @xmath62 = 0.5 ; each bin has typically between 10 and 45 objects . for each of the 89 sources in the missing subset we used the observed redshift and @xmath20 magnitude ( see fig",
    ".  [ lmissqfig ] ) to identify three mass values : the most likely mass ( the median mass value of the observed distribution in the appropriate @xmath0 and @xmath20 bin ) and the @xmath401@xmath36 mass values relative thereto , respectively .",
    "we then generated three catalogs of 1058 black hole mass estimates at @xmath60 , each consisting of the original 969 black hole mass estimates based on spectral measurements plus for the missing subset either the most likely mass value , the most likely mass @xmath63(m_bh @xmath1 ) , or the most likely mass @xmath64(m_bh @xmath1 ) , respectively .",
    "for each of these three mass catalogs we redetermined the mass functions for lbqs . by adopting the same type of mass estimate for each quasar in the missing subset we get a handle on the most likely mass functions and the @xmath65 extremes .",
    "notably , this is in practice different from running monto carlo simulations but gives us similar insight on the possible distributions of the mass functions .",
    "we show these adjusted mass functions as a function of mass in figure  [ lbqs_mf_missq.fig ] . for comparison the mass functions based on only the 969 quasars ( at @xmath60 ) with spectral measurements ( shown in figure  [ mfallfig ] )",
    "are also shown .",
    "the adjusted mass functions are shown as a function of redshift in figure  [ mfzfig ] . our omission ( or inclusion ) of the missing subset clearly has no significant effect on the lbqs mass function .",
    "figure  [ lbqs_mf_missq.fig ] shows that inclusion of the sources without mass estimates does not change the lbqs mass function ( to within the statistical uncertainties ) for redshifts below 2 . at higher redshifts the missing sources will at one extreme ( m_bh @xmath1(median ) @xmath12 ) tend to increase the peak amplitude of the mass function slightly , and at the other extreme ( m_bh @xmath1(median ) @xmath66 ) the mass function will broaden slightly toward higher masses .",
    "the latter has the stronger effect due to the lower number of sources with mass estimates above @xmath67 m _ @xmath3 .",
    "however , these variations are all within the statistical uncertainties with exception of the ( m_bh @xmath1 @xmath66 ) mass function which is marginally more deviant .",
    "notably , in reality the mass function of the full lbqs sample , that we could obtain if higher quality data were available of the missing subset , is more likely to be between the two extreme cases ; as expected , assigning the median mass of the relevant @xmath0 and @xmath20 bin does not change the mass function . we therefore conclude that we are not making a significant error at this point in excluding the sources with low quality spectra (  the missing subset ) in determining the lbqs black hole mass function .",
    "we repeated this exercise for the sdss color - selected sample since for four of the 38 quasars the black hole mass could not be estimated .",
    "the effects of assigning m_bh @xmath1(median ) @xmath12(m_bh @xmath1 ) or m_bh @xmath1(median ) @xmath66(m_bh @xmath1 ) to these few sources are shown in figure  [ sdss_mf_missq.fig ] .",
    "the differences in the mass functions are most noticeable when the extreme mass values of m_bh @xmath1(median ) @xmath66 are adopted : the mass function flattens slightly toward higher mass values .",
    "nonetheless , this extreme case mass function is still consistent to within the statistical uncertainties with the `` original '' mass function based on the 34 quasars with spectral measurements (  figure  [ mfallfig ] ) .",
    "therefore , exclusion of the four sources without mass estimates does not significantly affect the mass function of the sdss color - selected sample .",
    "we will reassess this issue of missing black hole masses in future work when analyzing the mass functions from this work with respect to the sdss dr3 mass functions of vestergaard  ( 2008 ) .",
    "the black hole mass functions for the lbqs and the sdss color - selected samples with these adjustments applied are listed in tables  [ lbqs_mfcor.tab ] and  [ sdss_mf.tab ] , respectively .",
    "the integrated mass density above a certain mass value in each sample is computed by summing the contribution of each individual object with central mass above a progressively increasing mass limit , @xmath68 :    @xmath69    figure  [ cummdens.fig ] shows the cumulative mass densities for each of the sdss , bqs , and lbqs samples .",
    "the mass densities are tabulated in table  [ bqs_sdss_cummdens.tab ] for the sdss and bqs samples and in tables  [ lbqs_mf.tab ] and  [ lbqs_mfcor.tab ] for the lbqs .    in figure  [ mfall2fig ]",
    "we show the distributions of @xmath70 for comparison . this representation is closer to the comoving volume ( number ) density of active black holes as a function of mass and makes the space density differences more apparent .",
    "the mass functions for the three quasar samples are shown as a function of black hole mass for different redshift bins in figure  [ mfallfig ] .",
    "three features are apparent : ( 1 ) the mass functions of the lbqs tend to turn over at the low mass end , ( 2 ) there is a general consistency of the slope of the high mass end between the mass functions in most of the redshift bins , and ( 3 ) the amplitude of the high mass end increases rapidly between mean redshifts of 4 to 2.5 and then decrease again below a redshift of 1 .",
    "this is particularly significant for the cumulative mass density ( fig .",
    "[ cummdens.fig ] ) .",
    "we briefly comment on each feature in the following .",
    "the turnover at the low mass end tends to occur when the low mass bins are incompletely populated [ cf .  with fig .",
    "[ mlolzfig ] ; see also the discussion of the sdss dr3 mass functions by vestergaard  ( 2008 ) and the statistical analysis of kelly , vestergaard , & fan ( 2009 ) ] .",
    "however , the analysis of the bqs mass function by kelly   indicates that part of such turnovers ( at least at low redshift ) are real , suggesting that the number of low mass active black holes does not necessarily stay constant or increase with decreasing mass .",
    "we determine the high mass end slopes , @xmath8 , of each mass function in fig .",
    "[ mfallfig ] ( _ top panel _ ) following the method of vestergaard  ( 2008 ) where @xmath71 .",
    "we first discuss the mass functions located at redshifts below 3.5 and thereafter discuss the case at @xmath723.5 . for the lbqs mass functions",
    "a typical high end slope were obtained for the redshift bins [ 0.2:0.5 ] , [ 0.5:1.0 ] , [ 1.0:1.5 ] , [ 1.5:2.0 ] , and [ 2.0:3.0 ] , respectively , for mass bins at or above 8.8dex , 9.2dex , 9.6dex , 9.6dex , and 10.0dex , respectively .",
    "the limits on the mass bins were adopted to ensure the mass bins are complete or nearly complete .",
    "note that given the uncertainties of between 0.4 to 1.4 there are no reasons to believe the apparent flattening of the mass functions toward higher redshifts is real . ]",
    "@xmath8 between about @xmath73 to @xmath74 was obtained with uncertainties ranging between 0.4 to 1.4 . for the bqs",
    "we find a slope of @xmath75 for mass bins at 8.6dex and above .",
    "these slopes are all consistent to within the uncertainties . also , they agree with the slope of @xmath7 observed for the sdss dr3 mass function below redshifts of about 3.8 ( vestergaard  2008 ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the high - end slopes of the sdss dr3 luminosity functions also have values of @xmath7 ( richards  2006 ) .",
    "however , for the mass function above redshift 3.5 , i.e. , of the sdss color - selected sample , we see a somewhat flatter slope of @xmath76 , determined for mass bins at 8.6dex and above .",
    "the reality of this flatter slope is also evident from figure  [ mfallfig ] .",
    "vestergaard   also reported an apparent flattening of the dr3 mass function slopes at @xmath77 but attributed this to the large errors and small number statistics in those redshift bins .",
    "since the color - selected sample is a well - defined and complete sample within the survey area and flux limits , the result for this sample should be robust , suggesting that there is indeed a real trend toward the high - mass black hole distribution to flatten at the highest redshifts .",
    "the constancy of the high mass end slope and of the amplitude of the mass function with redshift ( at @xmath78 ) may appear surprising , especially considering the large changes occurring for the evolution of the luminosity function (  boyle  2000 ; richards  2006 ) .",
    "for example , the amplitude of the sdss dr3 luminosity function drops more than two orders of magnitude at an absolute magnitude of @xmath1927 between redshifts two and 0.5 . in comparison ,",
    "the dr3 black hole mass function normalization changes only by a factor of a few and displays a similar constancy of the high mass end slope and amplitude at a wide range of redshifts . while this slope constancy may be real , we note the possibility that the statistical uncertainties in the black hole mass estimates of a factor of a few prohibits us from detecting subtle differences or any cosmic evolution of the high mass end slope .",
    "one issue to keep in mind is that contrary to the quasar luminosity , the mass of black holes does not decrease with time .",
    "the only way for the black holes to change the shape of the mass functions with cosmic time is by growing in mass or by their activity to decrease sufficiently to drop out of the quasar survey owing to its lower flux limits .    the mass function and the cumulative mass density distribution both display a rapid increase in amplitude at the highest masses by a factor of @xmath45 and @xmath410 , respectively , over a period of a giga - year from redshifts 4 ( sdss ) to 2.5 ( lbqs , 2@xmath93 ) .",
    "this is an interesting feature , especially considering the slower amplitude decrease below @xmath43 1 ; it is even more evident in the particular representation of the mass function shown in figure  [ mfall2fig ] .",
    "we are evidently directly seeing the population of massive black holes build up at these epochs as the density of actively accreting ( massive ) black holes rises rapidly toward lower redshift .",
    "this is also consistent with the observed rise in the quasar space density at these redshifts (  osmer 1982 ; schmidt  1995 ; warren  1994 ; fan  2001b ) and the relatively high eddington luminosity ratios observed for the sdss color - selected sample ( fig .  [ mlolzfig ] ) .",
    "we note that the space density information revealed by the luminosity functions does not make the mass functions obsolete .",
    "the luminosity functions tell us the space density of active black holes radiating at a given luminosity and redshift .",
    "the luminosity itself tells us how fast the black hole is accreting matter given the efficiency by which it converts matter to radiation but does not reveal whether we are observing a highly accreting , low mass black hole or a massive black hole accreting at moderate or low rates .",
    "the mass estimates confirm the latter scenario .",
    "the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ mlolzfig ] ( top panel ) shows the sdss flux limits folded with the cut - off in line widths of 1000 ^ -1 kms@xmath27 adopted for the sdss quasars ( schneider  2003 ) .",
    "if the former scenario was reality we would see the data points accumulate on and just above this dashed line . instead , we see a much wider distribution well above this limit .",
    "this is an important fact to keep in mind .",
    "the mass estimates and the mass functions also serve to break the degeneracy of the luminosity functions due to the loosely constrained radiative efficiency (  wyithe & radmanabhan 2006 ) , as noted in the introduction .",
    "the distinctly lower amplitudes of the mass function and the cumulative mass density distribution for the sdss sample at redshift four ( fig .  [ mfallfig ] ) show that there are somewhat fewer active black holes at a given mass and/or less massive active black holes at that epoch than at later cosmic times .",
    "in particular , high-@xmath0 quasars contribute very little to the mass density of active black holes . to examine this a little further and to test",
    "if this is merely a consequence of our inability to detect very low mass black holes at @xmath43 4 , we extrapolated the sdss mass function to very low masses based on the observed slope at the lower mass end ( @xmath79 m _",
    "@xmath3 ) .",
    "this extrapolation is shown in the top panel of figure  [ extrapolfig ] ( dashed line ) , allowing a comparison with the mass functions of the bqs and lbqs samples .",
    "we also show with a dotted line the general slope along which the lbqs mass functions at redshifts lower than two move with cosmic time .",
    "it is quite conceivable that , in the case of no survey flux limits , the lbqs mass functions would extend approximately along this line , since the sdss dr3 mass functions ( vestergaard  2008 ) exhibit a similar behavior .",
    "the dotted line is hence a guideline to the maximum growth that can occur from the earliest epochs according to observations .",
    "the extrapolated mass function at @xmath434 is clearly parallel to the dotted line , offset by about 0.6@xmath190.65dex in mass and about 1.25dex in space density .",
    "this parallel offset suggests that the sdss quasars are either rarer than at lower epochs by a factor of @xmath417 or they need to grow in mass by an average factor of 4 to 4.5 by redshift 2.5 ( ignoring black hole mergers ) .",
    "given the time passed between redshifts of four and 2.5 ( of order 1 gyr ) and quasar life times of much less than a giga year (  martini 2004 ; hopkins & hernquist 2008 ) , the massive black holes that are contributing to the mass function at @xmath434 are not the same most massive black holes observed at @xmath432.5 . the most massive black holes at @xmath434 would have ceased their activity and dropped out of our surveys by @xmath432.5 . hence , the shift in the mass functions at the highest masses is not due to simple mass growth and a space density increase must dominate . since galaxy mergers ( and hence black hole mergers ) are expected to occur more frequently in the earlier universe than at present , we expect that the less massive black holes ( than typically observed at redshift four ) undergo a combination of both minor and major mergers as well as growth by mass accretion between the epochs at redshifts four and two .",
    "this will cause these black holes to shift to higher masses and the mass function amplitude at the high mass end to shift upwards .    in the lower panel of figure  [ extrapolfig ]",
    "we show the cumulative mass density for the sdss extrapolated mass function .",
    "unless the distribution of low - mass black holes is significantly steeper than the extrapolated power - law discussed here then it is clear that the lack of detectable low - mass black holes at @xmath434 is not the reason for the large amplitude discrepancies ( both panels ) between the quasar populations observed at very early ( @xmath43 4 ) and at later ( @xmath802 ) epochs .",
    "a significant build - up of existing and future supermassive black holes is required to explain the quasar populations at later times .",
    "we therefore conclude that the active black hole population at high redshift must be different since significantly fewer active black holes exist and with lower mass density at @xmath43 4 than at @xmath43 2.5 and @xmath43 0.5 , respectively .",
    "an interesting theoretical exercise would be to place lower limits on the distribution of seed (  low mass ) black holes at redshifts of four required to explain the local distribution of ( lower mass ) black holes ( m_bh @xmath1@xmath81 m _",
    "@xmath3 ) for later observational tests of this prediction , for example , similar to the work by volonteri  ( 2008 ) .",
    "when comparing all the samples at redshifts below three the high - mass end of the mass functions show little mass growth in these black holes .",
    "in fact , the density of the highest mass black holes decreases with cosmic time at epochs later than @xmath431 , consistent with a general decrease in activity of the most massive black holes .",
    "this is also and more clearly seen in the representation of the mass function shown for different mass bins as a function of redshift , as we discuss next .",
    "although the lbqs only has about 1000 quasars distributed over a range of redshifts , it is still large enough to allow a determination of how the mass function depends on redshift for a given mass bin ( fig .  [ mfzfig ] ) .",
    "( the value of the lbqs in this regard will become particularly apparent when discussed in relation to the mass function of the sdss dr3 quasar sample which is statistically limited near a redshift of 3 . )",
    "this representation of the mass function directly shows at which epochs active black holes at a given mass are the most abundant .",
    "for example , the black holes of lower masses of 7.8 @xmath19 8.6 dex peak in their comoving space density in the local universe , while the more massive black hole of 10@xmath82 m",
    "_ @xmath3 are the most active at redshifts of 2 @xmath19 3 .",
    "figure  [ mfzfig]f shows that the expected density of such black holes is more than two orders of magnitude lower in the local universe . by comparing the mass functions for individual mass bins",
    "the cosmic downsizing (  ueda  2003 ) of active black holes is clearly evident : the most massive black holes are the most active at high redshifts while the lowest mass black holes are the most active at low redshift .",
    "we present the mass functions of actively accreting black holes for the bright quasar survey , the large bright quasar survey , and the sdss color - selected sample in the fall equatorial stripe and the database from which these mass functions are derived .",
    "we find similar amplitudes and slopes ( of about @xmath7 with uncertainties between 0.4 and 1.4 ) of the high mass end of the mass functions for different redshift bins and across quasar samples for redshifts below @xmath43.5 .",
    "this is similar to what was seen for the dr3 mass functions at a similar redshift range ( vestergaard  2008 ) .",
    "however , for the well - defined and complete sdss color - selected sample of quasars at redshifts between 3.6 and 5 we find a somewhat flatter slope of @xmath83 .",
    "comparison of the mass functions and the cumulative mass density distributions for the different samples shows that the active black hole population at redshifts of about 4 must be different than the black hole populations below a redshift of about 2.5 .",
    "in fact , we may be witnessing a fast build - up of the black hole population between redshifts of 4 and redshifts of @xmath42 .",
    "the mass functions presented here will be discussed in further detail in relation to other existing black hole mass functions and , in particular , the sdss dr3 mass functions ( vestergaard  2008 ) in a future paper ( m. vestergaard  2009 , in preparation ) . at that time",
    "we will also apply sophisticated statistical analysis ( kelly   2008a , 2009 ) to investigate the nature of the actual underlying mass distribution free of measurement uncertainties and , to a certain extent , of survey flux limits .",

    "<S> we present mass functions of distant actively accreting supermassive black holes residing in luminous quasars discovered in the large bright quasar survey ( lbqs ) , the bright quasar survey ( bqs ) , and the fall equatorial stripe of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) . </S>",
    "<S> the quasars cover a wide range of redshifts from the local universe to @xmath0 = 5 and were subject to different selection criteria and flux density limits . </S>",
    "<S> this makes these samples complementary and can help us gain additional insight on the true underlying black hole mass distribution free from selection effects and mass estimation errors through future studies . by comparing these quasar samples </S>",
    "<S> , we see evidence that the active black hole population at redshift four is somewhat different than that at lower redshifts , including that in the nearby universe . in particular , there is a sharp increase in the space density of the detected active black holes ( m_bh @xmath1@xmath2 m _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 ) between redshifts @xmath44 and @xmath42.5 . also , the mass function of the sdss quasars at @xmath5 has a somewhat flatter high mass - end slope of @xmath6 , compared to the mass functions based on quasars below @xmath0 of 3 ( bqs and lbqs quasars ) , which display typical slopes of @xmath7 ; the latter are consistent with the mass functions at similar redshifts based on the sdss data release 3 quasar catalog presented by vestergaard et al . </S>",
    "<S> we see clear evidence of cosmic downsizing in the comoving space density distribution of active black holes in the lbqs sample alone . in forthcoming papers , further analysis , comparison , and discussion of these mass functions </S>",
    "<S> will be made with other existing black hole mass functions , notably that based on the sdss dr3 quasar catalog . </S>",
    "<S> we present the relationships used to estimate the black hole mass based on the mgii emission line ; the relations are calibrated to the h@xmath8 and civ relations by means of several thousand high quality sdss spectra . </S>",
    "<S> mass estimates of the individual black holes of these samples are also presented . </S>"
