    "<S> in this paper , we study theoretically the behaviors of the magnetic excitations(mes ) in the normal and nematic phases of iron pnictides . </S>",
    "<S> the normal state mes exhibit commensurability to diamond and to square - like structure transition with the increase of energy . </S>",
    "<S> this structure transition persists in the spin and orbital scenarios of nematic phases , although the mes show anisotropic behaviors due to the @xmath0 symmetry breaking induced by the nematic orders . the mes exhibit distinct energy evolution behaviors between the spin and orbital scenarios of nematicity . for the spin - nematic scenario , </S>",
    "<S> the anisotropy of the mes persists up to the high energy region . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , for the orbital - nematic scenario , it reduces dramatically in the low energy region and is negligible in the high energy region . </S>",
    "<S> these distinct behaviors of the mes are attributed to the different origins between the spin and orbital scenarios of nematic orders . </S>"
