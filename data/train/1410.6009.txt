    "<S> short - range resonating - valence bond states in an orbitally degenerate magnet on a honeycomb lattice is studied . </S>",
    "<S> a quantum - dimer model is derived from the hamiltonian which represents the superexchange interaction and the dynamical jahn - teller ( jt ) effect . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce two local units termed `` spin - orbital singlet dimer '' , where two spins in a nearest - neighbor bond form a singlet state associated with an orbital polarization along the bond , and `` local jt singlet '' , where an orbital polarization is quenched due to the dynamical jt effect . </S>",
    "<S> a derived quantum - dimer model consists of the hopping of the spin - orbital singlet dimers and the jt singlets , and the chemical potential of the jt singlets . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the model by the mean - field approximation , and find that a characteristic phase , termed `` jt liquid phase '' , where both the spin - orbital singlet dimers and the jt singlets move quantum mechanically , is realized . </S>",
    "<S> possible scenarios for the recently observed non magnetic - ordered state in ba@xmath0cusb@xmath1o@xmath2 are discussed . </S>"
