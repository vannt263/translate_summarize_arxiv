    "the study of the spectra of cool stars requires detailed knowledge of molecular opacities .",
    "this includes important absorbers such as tio , co , and water vapor , which have bands that cover large wavelength ranges and are very important for the structure of the atmosphere due to their overall cooling or heating effects .",
    "in addition , there are a number of molecules that have bands covering comparatively small wavelength ranges ( e.g. , a few 10 or @xmath4 ) .",
    "many of them are trace molecules that have only small effects on the overall physical conditions inside the atmosphere but that are important for spectral classification and for the determination of stellar parameters such as effective temperatures , gravities and abundances .",
    "unfortunately , important molecular data such as energy levels , bound - free , and bound - bound cross - sections are only poorly known or not known at all for a number of these trace molecules .",
    "we have therefore started a project to update or provide for the first time molecular data of astrophysical interest for important trace molecules and consider in this work mgh .",
    "these data will be computed using state - of - the - art molecular physics codes and should improve our ability to model and analyze cool stellar atmospheres considerably .",
    "it is important to assess the quality of the computed molecular data .",
    "this is best done by comparing to experimental results ; however , this is only possible for very few molecules of astrophysical interest .",
    "in addition , in many cases the temperature range of astrophysical importance is higher than what can be reached with current experimental setups .",
    "therefore , indirect methods of testing and evaluating the molecular data are useful . in this paper , we use the general - purpose stellar atmosphere code phoenix to calculate model atmospheres and synthetic spectra with and without the new molecular data .",
    "the results of these calculations can then be used to assess the importance of particular molecular opacities on the structure of the atmosphere .",
    "the synthetic spectra can be used to verify the correct strength of the computed bands when compared to observational data .",
    "this procedure introduces uncertainties such as the treatment of the equation of state ( e.g. , the molecular data used in it ) , the treatment of lines and line profiles and the assumed parameters of the comparison star .",
    "however , differential analyses circumvent many of these problems and should allow a reasonable evaluation of the molecular bound - free and free - free data .",
    "the electronic bands of magnesium hydride have been detected over a wide range of stellar atmospheres including the photosphere of the sun @xcite , sunspot umbrae @xcite , f - k giants in the milky way halo and halos of other local group galaxies @xcite , and nearby l - dwarfs @xcite .",
    "mgh lines can be used as indicators of surface gravity in late - type stars @xcite and to determine magnesium isotope abundances @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of mgh has been extensively studied in the laboratory for many decades ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) and has received some theoretical attention ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "however , modern stellar atmosphere calculations require extensive , and complete , molecular line lists as molecular band absorption is the primary source of line - blanketing in cool stellar atmospheres , particularly m dwarfs . for many molecules , including mgh ,",
    "the only source for complete line lists is the extensive compilations of @xcite . while these compilations are highly valuable to stellar modelers , the methods necessary to compute 100s of millions of lines require a number of approximations which at times are severe . in this work ,",
    "we apply fully quantum - mechanical techniques to compute the complete line list for the @xmath5 transition of mgh .",
    "the parameters of the calculation are adjusted to force agreement with available experiments .",
    "however , our goal is to reproduce the global mgh opacity , hence we can not claim spectroscopic accuracy for a particular line . the @xmath1 line list constructed in this work is combined with line lists for the @xmath2 and the @xmath3 transitions computed by @xcite and tested in a range of stellar atmosphere models .",
    "an overview of the theory of molecular rotational lines is presented in section 2 with the results of the line list calculations and stellar models are given in section 3 .",
    "we present our conclusions in section 4 .",
    "for the purpose of the present calculations , accurate _ ab initio _ potential - energy surfaces given by @xcite have been used for both the @xmath6 and @xmath7 electronic states of mgh .",
    "their configuration interaction treatment includes singly- to triply - excited configurations ( sdtci ) in a large slater - type basis set , leading to good agreement of the derived spectroscopic constants with experimental data .    in order to bring the calculated potential curves into better agreement with experiment ,",
    "shifts of @xmath8 and @xmath9 have been applied in the present work to the @xcite @xmath7 and @xmath6 energies , respectively .",
    "details about this procedure are given in a separate publication for the @xmath10 electronic transition in mgh @xcite . in this way , the dissociation energies @xmath11 coincide with the experimental values given by @xcite for the ground state and by @xcite for the @xmath6 state .",
    "the dissociation energies adopted here are 10,243.26 and and 12,903.71 @xmath12 for the @xmath7 and @xmath6 of @xmath13mgh , respectively .",
    "the relative energies between the two potential curves were further shifted to match the energy difference corresponding to the pure @xmath14 vibronic transition . the value of @xmath15 , which corresponds to the average of the q@xmath16(0 ) and q@xmath17(1 ) transition energies measured by @xcite , was adopted .",
    "we note that this value for @xmath18 does not agree with the more recent measurements of bernath , black , & brault ( 1985 ) who find @xmath19 @xmath12 , though it is unclear how their value was arrived at .",
    "in fact , their assumption of a hund s coupling case ( a ) is in obvious contradiction with the small and regular @xmath20-doubling parameters , @xmath21 and @xmath22 . such a case for a @xmath23 transition is more typically characterized by hund s case ( b ) ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figures 122 and 124 ) .",
    "further , @xcite suggest that a number of low-@xmath24 lines , presumably @xmath25(1 ) , @xmath26(1 ) , @xmath27(0 ) , @xmath27(1 ) , @xmath27(2 ) , and @xmath28(2 ) , measured by @xcite do not exist apparently assuming hund s case ( a ) . however , we find that under hund s case ( b ) all but @xmath25(1 ) and @xmath27(0 ) do in fact exist .",
    "we therefore adopted the value of @xmath18 deduced from @xcite .    out of the range of internuclear separations @xmath29 to @xmath30 considered by @xcite ,",
    "the potential curves have been extrapolated in two different ways . on the one hand , for internuclear distances @xmath31 , a smooth fit to the _ ab initio _",
    "potentials has been performed using the average long - range interaction potential @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the usual van der waals coefficients corresponding to the dipole - dipole , dipole - quadrupole , and the sum of dipole - quadrupole and dipole - octupole interactions , respectively . for the @xmath7 ground state ,",
    "the coefficients described in @xcite were adopted as summarized in table [ tbl1 ] . since to our knowledge ,",
    "no data have been reported for the van der waals constants of the @xmath6 state of mgh , they were estimated using a technique based on the london formula as described for the @xmath36 state by @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , for internuclear distances @xmath37 , the potential curves of both the @xmath7 and the @xmath6 electronic states have been fitted to the short - range interaction exponential form @xmath38 .    in a similar way , the dipole transition moment for @xmath39 and the dipole moment of the @xmath40 state calculated by @xcite have been used over the range @xmath29 to @xmath30 , and extrapolated by an exponential fit for both the short- and long - range interactions . the dipole transition moment and the dipole moment",
    "were both smoothly forced to zero at the united - atom and separated - atom limits .      throughout the present study ,",
    "we have adopted the now well established point of view expressed by @xcite with respect to the preferred way in which dipole matrix elements of a rotational transition should be separated into rotational and electronic - vibrational parts .    for the @xmath39 absorption band system of the present study ,",
    "the rotational oscillator strength can be expressed as given by @xcite , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the rovibrational matrix element of the electric dipole transition moment @xmath43 responsible for absorption from the @xmath7 into the @xmath6 electronic state and @xmath44 are the rovibrational wave functions .",
    "the hnl - london factors @xmath45 are defined according to @xcite as @xmath46    for the sake of comparison with the band oscillator strength values calculated by @xcite , we used the following relation between band and rotational oscillator strengths , as defined in eq.([fbr ] ) , @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a degeneracy factor arising from spin - splitting and @xmath20-doubling in both final and initial electronic states .",
    "the energy levels together with the rovibrational wavefunctions @xmath50 and @xmath51 of the final and initial electronic state have been calculated by solving the radial nuclear equation by standard numerov techniques @xcite .",
    "these calculations have been performed using a step of @xmath52 for the integration over internuclear distances from @xmath53 to @xmath54 for @xmath13mgh , the reduced mass 0.9671852  u = 1763.064  a.u .",
    "@xcite was adopted .    in table",
    "[ tbl2 ] , the vibrational binding energies of the @xmath6 state calculated for the present study are given together with the corresponding values of @xmath55 .",
    "the latter are found to be in excellent agreement with the previous calculations of @xcite up to @xmath56 . for higher vibrational levels ,",
    "a maximum difference of 125 @xmath12 occurs for @xmath57 .",
    "moreover , our fitting procedure to the long - range interaction potential yields an additional vibrational level near threshold to give @xmath58 .",
    "the maximum @xmath59 for each @xmath60 is also shown in table  [ tbl2 ] giving a total of 435 rovibrational states .",
    "rovibrational states is given in @xcite .",
    "] comparison to the limited experimental data shows the calculated @xmath61 s to be smaller by up to 45 @xmath12 which suggests that the @xcite potential is somewhat broader than reality .",
    "the band oscillator strength values for the band system @xmath39 are given in table [ tbl3 ] for the transitions between the vibrational states @xmath62 and @xmath63 . the current calculations satisfactorily reproduce the theoretical results of @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the line absorption rotational oscillator strengths for the @xmath39 transition as a function of the energy of the absorbed photon .",
    "it is worth noting the presence of a series of peaks which correspond to the @xmath64 lines of the r - branch [ @xmath65 whose intensities are larger by a factor two than all other lines in the same wavelength region .",
    "a detailed examination of the wavelength distribution of these peaks reveals that they are to be classified into three categories , according to whether they are @xmath66 transitions as shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "apart from these peaks , the r - branch contribution dominates over the wavelength ranges @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "other lines observed in figure [ fig1 ] are to be assigned mainly to the q - branch transitions , which are about two times more intense than the p - branch over the whole wavelength range considered",
    ". however , the p - branch appears to play a major role for the energy range @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the product @xmath71 , the so - called @xmath72-value , is plotted in figure [ fig2 ] as a function of the absorbed photon energy were comparison is made to the line list of @xcite . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the @xcite calculations were performed with a model rotational hamiltonian using spectroscopic constants @xcite .",
    "thus , the differences arising between both sets of results can be mainly explained by the fact that the model hamiltonian method , though satisfactory for low - lying rovibrational levels , may lose accuracy as @xmath73 and/or @xmath24 increase .",
    "further , it seems that the same @xmath74 was used for all vibrational levels ( kurucz , private communication , 2002 ) which is clearly not the case as shown in table  [ tbl2 ] .",
    "this appears to explain why the band - series in the @xcite calculations extend to larger photon energies .",
    "the models used for this work were calculated as described in @xcite .",
    "these models and their comparisons to earlier versions are the subject of a separate publication @xcite and we thus do not repeat the detailed description of the models here .",
    "however , we will briefly summarize the major physical properties .",
    "the models are based on the ames h@xmath17o and tio line lists by @xcite and @xcite and also include as a new addition the line lists for feh by @xcite and for vo and crh by r. freedman ( nasa - ames , private communication ) .",
    "the models account for equilibrium formation of dust and condensates and include grain opacities for 40 species . in the following",
    ", the models will be referred to as `` ames - dusty '' for models in which the dust particles stay in the layers in which they have formed and `` ames - cond '' for models in which the dust particles have sunk below the atmosphere from the layers in which they originally formed . we stress that large uncertainties persist in the water opacities for parts of the temperature range of this work @xcite . however , almost all mgh bands are in the optical and are thus affected minimally by the quality of the water opacities .",
    "in addition to the opacity sources listed above and in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) we added the new @xmath75-@xmath40 bound - bound radiative transition data from this work and the @xmath76-@xmath40 and @xmath40-@xmath40 data from @xcite for all isotopes @xmath13mgh , @xmath77mgh , and @xmath78mgh to our opacity database . in order to assess the effects of the new mgh data , we compare spectra calculated with these opacity sources to spectra calculated with the mgh line data provided by kurucz in his list of spectral lines of diatomic molecules @xcite . in addition ,",
    "we have computed a number of models with and without mgh data .",
    "the original ames grid was calculated for effective temperatures of m , l , and t  dwarfs .",
    "the hotter models in this work are based on the same physics as the ames grid and merely differ in the effective temperature .",
    "the models used in the following discussion were all iterated to convergence for the parameters indicated .",
    "the high resolution spectra which have the individual opacity sources selected are calculated on top of the models .",
    "the mgh bands are too localized in a region with little flux , or too weak to influence the temperature structure of the atmosphere .    in figure [ figspec ]",
    "we show comparisons between spectra from models using no mgh data , spectra from models using the new mgh line list and spectra from models using the @xcite mgh line list in the spectral region where the mgh bands are most prominent .",
    "the comparisons have been done at effective temperatures of 2000  k , 3000  k , and 4000  k to sample the temperature range in which mgh is visible in the spectrum . for convenience , we only did the comparison for models with log(g)=5.0 .",
    "as can be seen , the @xcite line lists overestimates the opacity due to the inclusion of non - existent levels with high @xmath24-values and the use of a model hamiltonian approach . the differences between the spectra with the new and @xcite mgh line lists are very similar for the ames - cond and ames - dusty models although the overall flux level and the overall flux shape are different for ames - cond and ames - dusty in the optical ( note that reversing the 1.0  dex offset applied in the plot is not sufficient to match the two 2000  k models )",
    "another view is presented in figure [ figdiff ] which shows the relative difference in the spectra . as can be seen",
    ", there are significant differences spreading among both the @xmath49 and the @xmath79 transitions .",
    "since the mgh data presented by @xcite was intended for solar - type stars we also compared the resulting spectra for an effective temperature of 5800  k and log(g)=4.5 , relevant parameters for solar - type stars .",
    "as can be seen as part of figure [ figdiff ] , the differences are negligible . although the effect of the non - existent levels with high @xmath24-values should be more important for hotter temperatures , the decrease in the abundance of mgh at higher temperatures makes the effect unobservable .",
    "finally , we want to note that for the 2000  k ames - cond model the x - x band adds a small amount of opacity at around 4   and 10 .",
    "using a combination of theoretical and experimental data on the potential energies and dipole transition moment of mgh , a comprehensive theoretical vibrational - rotational line list for the @xmath0 transition was constructed . when using the new @xmath1 line data and the new @xmath2 and the @xmath3 line data of @xcite in synthetic spectrum calculations , we find significant differences in the opacity when comparing the spectra to calculations using the existing data of @xcite .",
    "the differences are largest for effective temperatures pertaining to l and m type stars and can easily be seen in low resolution work . for hotter stars , of k and g type , the differences are less pronounced and high resolution spectra are required to notice the improvements for the hottest stars .",
