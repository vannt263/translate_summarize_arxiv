    "<S> we discuss one of the most prominent features of the very recent preliminary elliptic flow data of @xmath0 meson from the phenix collaboration @xcite . even within the the rather large error bars of the measured data </S>",
    "<S> a negative elliptic flow parameter ( @xmath1 ) for @xmath0 in the range of @xmath2 is visible . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that this negative elliptic flow at intermediate @xmath3 is a clear and qualitative signature for the collectivity of charm quarks produced in nucleus - nucleus reactions at rhic . within a parton recombination approach </S>",
    "<S> we show that a negative elliptic flow puts a lower limit on the collective transverse velocity of heavy quarks . the numerical value of the transverse flow velocity @xmath4 for charm quarks that is necessary to reproduce the data is @xmath5 and therefore compatible with the flow of light quarks .    the main goal of the current and past heavy ion programs is the search for a new state of matter called the quark - gluon - plasma ( qgp ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> major breakthroughs for the potential discovery @xcite of this new state of matter were the observation of constituent quark number scaling of the elliptic flow @xmath6 , with @xmath7 being the number of constituent quarks in the respective hadron as well as the observation of jet quenching at intermediate transverse momenta @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> together with the standard hydrodynamical interpretation this implies a rapid thermalization and a strong collective flow of the qcd matter created at rhic . </S>",
    "<S> however , open questions remain : how can one obtain a consistent description of the high @xmath3 suppression and the elliptic flow of heavy flavour quarks and hadrons . </S>",
    "<S> i.e. is the collectivity at rhic restricted to light quarks ( up , down , strange ) or do even charm ( bottom ) quarks participate in the collective expansion of the partonic system and reach local kinetic equilibrium ?    previously , it was assumed that local equilibrium of ( heavy ) quarks could not be achieved within pqcd transport simulations . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , older studies @xcite based on a parton cascade dynamics restricted to @xmath8 parton interactions seemed to indicate that the opacity needed to achieve local equilibrium would be at least an order of magnitude higher than pqcd estimates . </S>",
    "<S> however , recent state - of - the - art parton cascade calculations ( including @xmath9 parton interactions ) have clearly shown that pqcd cross sections are sufficient to reach local ( gluon ) equilibrium and allow to describe the measured elliptic flow data @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the aim of the present letter is to investigate whether also the charm quark does locally equilibrate and therefore follows the flow of the light quarks . here </S>",
    "<S> we will focus on the @xmath0 because it reflects the momentum distribution of the charm quarks directly , in addition first experimental data on the @xmath0 elliptic flow just became available . </S>",
    "<S> we will show that the recently measured negative elliptic flow of @xmath0 s provides a unique _ lower _ bound on the charm quark s collective velocity .    </S>",
    "<S> under the assumption of local equilibration of light quarks a hydrodynamic parametrization of the freeze - out hyper - surface to parametrize the quark emission function , namely the blast - wave model , can be employed . for the charm quarks , </S>",
    "<S> the same emission function is used , however , with the transverse collective velocity as a free parameter to be determined by the preliminary phenix data . to calculate @xmath0 s from the charm quark emission function , </S>",
    "<S> we apply the well known parton recombination approach @xcite . details ( like the exact form of the freeze - out hyper - surface ) of the specific approach employed here can be found in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> different from there we used a linear increasing transverse flow rapidity instead of a constant one , but the mean value has been preserved .    </S>",
    "<S> here we summarize the most important features : in a coalescence process the quarks contribute equally to the hadrons momentum , so it inherits its azimuthal asymmetry directly from its constituents . </S>",
    "<S> therefore in recombination the elliptic flow of @xmath0 s emerges directly from a negative @xmath1 of the charm quark . to incorporate the asymmetry , the transverse expansion rapidity @xmath10 depend on the azimuthal angle @xmath11 and the radial coordinate @xmath12 as @xmath13 with the eccentricity @xmath14 and @xmath15 to model the damping at high @xmath3 . with the factor </S>",
    "<S> @xmath16 we recover @xmath17 as the mean transverse rapidity after integrating over @xmath18 .    by applying the definition of the elliptic flow one obtains @xcite @xmath19 k_1 \\left[b(\\phi,\\rho)\\right ] \\ , d\\phi\\ ,   \\rho\\ , d\\rho } { \\int i_0 \\left[a(\\phi,\\rho)\\right ] k_1\\left[b(\\phi,\\rho)\\right ] \\ , </S>",
    "<S> d\\phi\\ , \\rho\\ , d\\rho}\\ ] ] with @xmath20 , @xmath21 and the modified bessel functions @xmath22 and @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> for a more general hydrodynamical hypersurface one could assume a dependence of freeze - out time @xmath24 on the radial coordinate @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> this would lead to additional terms involving @xmath25 and bessel functions of other order . </S>",
    "<S> we have checked that the modifications are only minor and therefore neglect the contributions in this letter for brevity .    </S>",
    "<S> let us investigate the elliptic flow of the @xmath0 at midrapidity as a function of the transverse momentum for various transverse flow velocities as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ plt : jpsi_flow ] . </S>",
    "<S> the lines from top to bottom indicate calculations with a charm quark mass @xmath26 for different mean expansion velocities @xmath27 , the data by the phenix collaboration are shown as symbols with error bars indicating a negative elliptic flow for @xmath0 s at intermediate transverse momenta . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation shows that with increasing transverse flow a negative @xmath1 at low @xmath3 ( above @xmath28  gev , the elliptic flow values turn positive again ) develops for the @xmath0 , posing a lower bound of @xmath29 for the charm quarks flow . </S>",
    "<S> the best fit to the data is obtained with a mean charm flow velocity of @xmath30 equal to the light quark flow velocity extracted from previous fits within the same model .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ plt : compare_flow ] we use @xmath30 and compare the elliptic flow to other heavy mesons and fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ plt : quark_flow ] shows the same for the quarks . </S>",
    "<S> the value for @xmath31 , with a bottom quark mass of @xmath32 , is negativ in the whole range of applicability . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to @xmath0 , the @xmath1 of @xmath33 stays positiv . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the positive light quark @xmath1 , which competes with the negative one for the charm quark , and results in nearly zero elliptic flow at low @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> while the @xmath34 meson follows the @xmath33 flow for @xmath35 , it is much more suppressed at higher @xmath3 due to the strong negative flow of the bottom quark and approximately zero up to @xmath36 .    </S>",
    "<S> data on @xmath37-meson elliptic flow is not yet available . </S>",
    "<S> when comparing it to the non - photonic electron @xmath1 , our calculations fail to predict the data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these two observables have been predicted to be similiar @xcite , since the non - photonic electrons are mainly from , @xmath37-meson decays , but with a small contribution of @xmath38-meson decays . </S>",
    "<S> but the electron elliptic flow is no straightforward probe for the @xmath33 @xmath1 . since the electron is not the only decay product , the decay kinematics might smear out the resulting elliptic flow of the electrons . at low @xmath3 , </S>",
    "<S> the increase of the @xmath33 flow is similiar to the electron data , but shifted to higher transverse momenta . above @xmath39 </S>",
    "<S> the electron @xmath1 starts to decrease which might be due to contributions from the @xmath38-mesons or an early onset of the fragmentation regime .    </S>",
    "<S> direct measurements on the elliptic flow of heavy mesons will be available in the near future with the heavy - flavor tracker for star , which will allow a better analysis . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the presented results are based only the @xmath0 elliptic flow data .    ) of </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 s for @xmath40 for different mean transverse expansion velocities ( lines ) compared to preliminary data from phenix collaboration @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> these results provide strong evidence for a substantial collectivity and transverse expansion of the charm quarks in nucleus - nucleus reactions at rhic . due to the large error bars this has to be verified when more precise data is available . </S>",
    "<S> note that our present findings are different from previous approaches that assume incomplete thermalization of the charm @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also verified our findings within a boltzmann approach to coalescence @xcite using our parametrizations and received similar results .    </S>",
    "<S> one should also note that the observation of negative elliptic flow of heavy particles is well known in the literature ( even if not conclusively observed experimentally up to now ) . </S>",
    "<S> it appears due to an interplay between transverse expansion and particle mass , the more flow and the heavier the particle the more negative values does the elliptic flow reach . </S>",
    "<S> e.g. , negative values of the elliptic flow parameter for heavy hadrons has also been found in previous exploratory studies and seem to be a general feature of the blast - wave like flow profile at high transverse velocities @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it reflects the depletion of the low @xmath3 particle abundance , when the source elements are highly boosted in the transverse direction . </S>",
    "<S> the difference to the present study is that here , @xmath1 is already negative on the quark level . </S>",
    "<S> negative elliptic flow values will even be encountered for light quarks at asymptotically high bombarding energies as discussed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one might argue that this is an artefact of the blast - wave peak and will not survive in more realistic calculations , however also transport model calculations show slightly negative @xmath1 values for heavy particles at low transverse momenta @xcite .    in conclusion , we have shown that the recent preliminary phenix data exhibiting a negative elliptic flow at low @xmath3 can be explained within a parton recombination approach using a blast - wave like parametrization . </S>",
    "<S> we point out that studying @xmath42 from @xmath0 offers the possibility to put a lower limit on the charm quark transverse velocity . from the present quantitative analysis we expect the transverse velocity of charm quarks to be above @xmath43 . within the limits of the present model </S>",
    "<S> the best description of the data is obtain for a charm transverse velocity equal to the light quark velocity of @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> so if more precise data will still support the negative @xmath1 , we conclude from this observation that charm quarks reach a substantial amount of local kinetic equilibration . </S>"
