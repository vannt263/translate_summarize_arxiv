    "as technology goes on @xcite , one can expect a wide expansion of the so - called _",
    "sensor networks_. such networks represent the next evolutionary step in building , utilities , industrial , home , agriculture , defense and many other contexts  @xcite .",
    "these networks are built upon a multitude of small and cheap sensors which are devices with limited transmission capabilities .",
    "each sensor monitors a region around itself by measuring some environmental quantities ( e.g. , temperature , humidity ) , detecting intrusion , etc , and broadcasts its collected informations to other sensors or to a central node .",
    "the question of whether information can be shared among the whole network is then of crucial importance .",
    "many researches have recently been dedicated to this problem considering a variety of situations .",
    "it is possible to categorize three main scenarios : those where it is possible to choose the position of each sensor , those where sensors are arbitrarily deployed in the target region with the control of a central station and those where the sensor locations are random in a decentralized system .",
    "the problem of the first scenario is that , in many cases , placing the sensors is impossible or implies a high cost .",
    "sometimes this impossibility comes from the fact that the cost of placing each sensor is too large and sometimes the network has an inherent random behavior ( like in the ad hoc case , where users move ) .",
    "in addition , this policy can not take into account the configuration of the network in the case of failure of some sensor .",
    "the drawback of the second scenario is a higher unity cost of sensors , since each one has to communicate with the central station .",
    "besides , the central station itself increases the cost of the whole system .",
    "moreover , if sensors are supposed to know their positions , an absolute positioning system has to be included in each sensor , making their hardware even more complex and then more expensive .",
    "it is thus important to investigate the third scenario : randomly located sensors , no central station .",
    "actually , if we can predict some characteristics of the topology of a random network , the number of sensors ( or , as well , the power supply of them ) can be _ a priori _ determined such that a given network may operate with high probability .",
    "for instance , we can choose the mean number of sensors such that , if they are randomly deployed , there is more than 99% of probability the network to be completely connected .",
    "usually , sensors are deployed in the plane or in the ambient space , thus mathematically speaking , one has to deal with configurations in @xmath0 @xmath1 or a manifold .",
    "the recent works of ghrist and his collaborators  @xcite show how , in any dimension , algebraic topology can be used to compute the coverage of a given configuration of sensors . trying to pursue their work for random settings",
    ", we quickly realized that the dimension of the ambient space played a key role .",
    "we then first began by the analysis of dimension @xmath2 , which appeared as the most simple situation .",
    "there is here no need of the sophisticated tools of algebraic topology .",
    "however , it does nt seem that the problem of coverage on a finite length interval has already been solved in the full extent we do here .",
    "higher dimensions will be the object of forthcoming papers .",
    "we here address the situation where the radio communications are sufficently polarized so that we can consider we have some privileged dimension .",
    "random coverage in one dimension has been already studied in different contexts .",
    "some years ago already , several analysis were done on the circle ( @xcite and references therein ) for a fixed number of points and uniform distribution of points over the circle .",
    "the question addressed was that of full coverage .",
    "more recently , in  @xcite , efficient algorithms to determine whether a region is covered considering the sensors are deployed over a circle and distributed as a poisson point process are given .",
    "in @xcite , the distribution of a fixed number of clusters ( see below for the definition ) is given .",
    "in @xcite , sensors are actually placed in a plan , have a fixed radius of observation .",
    "the trace of the covered regions over a line is then studied .",
    "our main result is the distribution of the number of connected components for a poisson distribution of sensors in a bounded interval .",
    "our method is very much related to queueing theory .",
    "indeed , clusters , i.e. , sequence of neighboring sensors , are the strict analogous of busy periods .",
    "as will appear below , our analysis turns down to be that of an m / d/1/1 queue with preemption : when a customer arrives during a service , it preempts the server and , since there is no buffer , the customer who was in service is removed from the queuing system . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "such a system has never been studied but the usual methods of laplace transform , renewal processes , work perfectly and with a bit of calculus , one can compute all the characteristics we are interested in .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way : section ii presents the physical and random assumptions and defines the relevant quantities to be calculated .",
    "the calculations and analytical results are presented in section iii . in section iv ,",
    "two other scenarios are presented , considering the number of incomplete clusters and clusters placed in a circle . in section v , numerical examples are presented and analyzed .",
    "let @xmath3 be the length of the domain in which sensors are located .",
    "we assume that sensors are distributed according to a poisson process of intensity @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath5 be the positions of the sensors .",
    "we thus know that the random variables , @xmath6 are i.i.d . and exponentially distributed . due to their technological limitations ,",
    "each sensor can communicate only with other sensors within a range @xmath7 : two sensors , located respectively at @xmath8 and @xmath9 , are said to be _ directly connected _ whenever @xmath10 for @xmath11 , two sensors located at @xmath12 and @xmath13 are indirectly connected if @xmath14 and @xmath15 are directly connected for any @xmath16 a set of sensors directly or indirectly connected is called a _",
