    "we stress that we do not include the spin3/2 decuplet in the effective field theory @xcite , but rather use these fields to estimate the pertinent low  energy constants ( resonance saturation principle ) .",

    "in particular , in contrast to ref.@xcite , the parameters @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath132 are no longer free .",

    "the contribution from scalar meson exchange only enters the uncertainties of the numbers given .",

    "nucleon @xmath0term , where approximately 130 mev to the nucleon mass were attributed to the strange matrix element @xmath142 ( with a sizeable uncertainty ) @xcite .",
    "the spread of the various values is a good measure of the uncertainties related to this complete @xmath53 calculation .",
    "let us take a closer look at the quark mass expansion of the nucleon mass , in the notation of eq.([massform ] ) , @xmath143 this looks similar for the other octet baryons .",
    "we conclude that the quark mass corrections of order @xmath5 , @xmath144 and @xmath8 are all of the same size",
    ". can be significantly smaller .",
    "however , the nucleon mass is much more sensitive to the scalar contribution than the other octet masses . ] in ref.@xcite , it was argued that only the leading non  analytic corrections ( lnac )",
    "@xmath51 are large and that further terms like the ones @xmath145 are modestly small , of the order of 100 mev",
    ". this would amount to an expansion in @xmath146 with a large leading term .",
    "this expectation is not borne out by our results , the next corrections are as large as the lnacs .",
    "these findings agree with the meson cloud model calculation of gasser @xcite .",
    "a last remark about the baryon masses concerns the deviation from the gell - mann - okubo relation , @xmath147 which empirically is about 6.5 mev .",
    "we find @xmath148 mev , which is larger in magnitude than the value found in @xcite .",
    "we remark that in our case the decuplet contribution is contained in the @xmath8 contributions and not in the @xmath144 as in @xcite .",
    "therefore , in our case , @xmath149 is dominated by the @xmath8 piece . the sizeable uncertainty in the chiral limit masses , eq.([mkrig ] ) , does not allow for a very accurate statement about this very small quantity .",
    "it is also very sensitive to the scalar couplings . to get a better handle on this issue , one either has to be able to fix all pertinent low ",
    "energy constants at order @xmath8 from data or improve upon the resonance saturation estimate used here by including e.g. the mass splitting within the decuplet and the su(3 ) breaking of the decuplet - octet - meson couplings",
    ". a better understanding of this topic is , of course , at the heart of the determination of the quark mass ratio @xmath150 from the baryon masses ( once the electromagnetic corrections have been included ) .",
    "nucleon @xmath0term is completely fixed . using for @xmath1 its average , we find ( no scalar resonance contribution ) @xmath151 with an uncertainty of about @xmath152 mev due to the spread in @xmath1 .",
    "this number compares favourably with the one found in ref.@xcite , @xmath153  mev .",
    "we stress that this result reflects a very non  trivial consistency for the complete calculation to quadratic order in the quark masses using the resonance saturation principle in the scalar sector . the additional contribution from the scalar meson exchange",
    "is accounted for in the @xmath152 mev uncertainty . to be specific",
    ", we have @xmath154 .",
    "it is furthermore instructive to disentangle the various contributions to @xmath155 of order @xmath156 , @xmath64 and @xmath53 , respectively , @xmath157 which shows a moderate convergence , i.e. the terms of increasing order become successively smaller .",
    "still , the @xmath53 contribution is important .",
    "also , at this order no @xmath158 rescattering effects are included .",
    "we notice that using the values for @xmath112 and @xmath35 as determined in ref.@xcite leads to a much increased fourth order contribution .",
    "in this paper , we have used heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory to calculate the octet baryon masses to quadratic order in the quark masses , including 20 local operators with unknown coeffcients .",
    "these low  energy constants were fixed by resonance exchange .",
    "the dominant contribution comes indeed from the excitation of the spin3/2 decuplet fields .",
    "tadpole graphs with scalar meson exchange only lead to small corrections .",
    "this left us with one free parameter , the baryon mass in the chiral limit , which could be determined within 18% accuracy , and is compatible with the value inferred for the strange matrix  element @xmath159 in ref.@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the pion  nucleon @xmath0term comes out surprisingly close to its empirical value , @xmath160  mev , with an uncertainty of about @xmath152 mev .",
    "this first exploratory @xmath53 study of the three flavor scalar sector of baryon chpt points towards a significant improvement compared to previous investigations which were mostly confined to so  called `` computable '' corrections and/or fitted a few of the pertinent low  energy constants . however , the calculation is not yet accurate enough to determine the quark mass ratio @xmath76 reliably from the octet masses .",
    "furthermore , we did not address the kaon ",
