    "a large azimuthal anisotropy is observed for particle production in heavy ion collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "this anisotropy has been successfully described in terms of pressure - driven collective flow , which converts the spatial asymmetries of the initially created matter into transverse momentum ( @xmath5 ) space  @xcite .",
    "such anisotropy can be expressed as fourier series in azimuthal angle ( @xmath9 ) : @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 represent the magnitude and direction of @xmath13-order flow respectively .",
    "asymmetries giving rise to non - zero @xmath11 are associated with either an average shape ( for @xmath14 ) or shapes due to the spatial fluctuations of the participating nucleons  @xcite ; the @xmath15 term is known as dipole asymmetry . due to the approximate boost invariance of the created matter , the @xmath11",
    "are expected to be even functions in rapidity ( rapidity - even )  @xcite . however ,",
    "a small rapidity - odd @xmath11 component , especially for @xmath15 , may arise from the `` sideward '' deflection of the created matter  @xcite .",
    "this rapidity - odd @xmath3 is expected to be very small for the rapidity range and the collision energies considered here  @xcite , and is not considered in this paper .",
    "the harmonics in eq .",
    "[ eq : vn1 ] is also reflected in the two - particle correlation ( 2pc ) in @xmath16 : @xmath17 with @xmath18 recent studies at the lhc show that the latter factorization is valid for @xmath19 at low @xmath5 for particle pairs with a large rapidity gap  @xcite , but fails for @xmath15 over the entire @xmath5 range .",
    "this is understood to be due to global momentum conservation for a finite multiplicity system , which may induce a negative dipole component in eq .",
    "[ eq : vnnb ]  @xcite : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the total multiplicity in the event and @xmath22 is the fraction of particles that are correlated via momentum conservation , and hence the parameter @xmath23 has a dimention of gev@xmath24 .",
    "recent studies by the atlas collaboration  @xcite and retinskaya  _ et.al . _",
    "@xcite shows that @xmath25 can indeed be described by eq .",
    "[ eq : v1a ] over broad ranges of @xmath1 .",
    "many models based on ideal / viscous hydrodynamics or transport theory have been developed to describe the @xmath11 and @xmath26 data  @xcite .",
    "they show that sizable higher - oder flow ( @xmath19 ) can be generated by including fluctuations of the initial geometry . in some cases ,",
    "reasonable agreement with the @xmath11 data has been achieved . however , due to the complication associated with the global momentum conservation , most of these model attempts have avoided a prediction for @xmath3 .",
    "recently , gardim _ et.al _",
    "@xcite performed the first calculation of the rapidity - even @xmath3 in a hydrodynamic calculations ; a modified event plane ( ep ) method was also proposed  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath27 was predicted to change sign at low @xmath5 , due to the constraint that the total transverse momentum of the system arising from dipolar flow should vanish , i.e. @xmath28  @xcite .",
    "this sign - flip can lead to rather complicated dependence of @xmath25 on @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : v1b ] ) .",
    "this complicated pattern has been observed in the atlas data , and is expected to also exist in transport models .",
    "furthermore , the systems that are related via momentum conservation could be smaller than the whole event ( for example a dijet system )  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the value of @xmath23 ( eq .",
    "[ eq : v1b ] ) may depend on other kinematic variables such as the relative pseudorapidity ( @xmath31 ) of the particle pairs .",
    "hence , it is advantageous to determine @xmath23 via the fit method used by the atlas collaboration , instead of calculating it directly .    in this work",
    ", we present a quantitative study of the rapidity - even @xmath32 using a generalization of the atlas fitting method within the ampt ( a multi phase transport ) model  @xcite .",
    "the ampt model combines the initial condition from hijing  @xcite and final state interaction via a parton and hadron transport model .",
    "the outputs are complete monte - carlo events that naturally contains various flow and non - flow effects , including the global momentum conservation",
    ". we shall demonstrate that the @xmath25 from ampt has similar features as the experimental data , and can be well described by eq .",
    "[ eq : v1a ] , lending support to the procedure used by atlas .",
    "we then make quantitative predictions on how @xmath3 varies with @xmath5 , @xmath6 , centrality , collision energy and parameters in the partonic transport , as well as to compare with the atlas data .",
    "the initial condition from ampt is seeded by a glauber model for nucleon - nucleon scatterings , hence it contains the fluctuations which generate the event - by - event spatial asymmetries .",
    "the nucleon - nucleon scatterings provide both minijet partons for hard scattering and strings for soft coherent interactions ; these strings are then converted into soft partons via a string melting scheme .",
    "the parton and hadron transport is responsible for transforming the initial asymmetries into the momentum anisotropy .",
    "the parton transport include only elastic scattering whose cross - sections are controlled by the values of the strong coupling constant ( @xmath33 ) and the debye screening mass ( @xmath34 )  @xcite : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the mandelstam variable for four momentum transfer .",
    "the total cross - section can be increased either with a larger @xmath33 or a smaller value of @xmath34 .",
    "however changing @xmath33 is more effective for momentum dissipation than changing @xmath34 , as decreasing @xmath34 includes only softer scattering ( eq .  [ eq : cros ] ) .",
    "partons are recombined into hadrons at the freezeout , followed by a hadronic transport .",
    "ampt events are generated for two different @xmath33 values for parton transport : set - a with @xmath37 and set - b with @xmath38 from  @xcite  . ] .",
    "we vary the total cross - section from 1.5 mb to 10 mb by adjusting @xmath34 according to  @xcite , separately for set - a and set - b .",
    "varying @xmath33 and @xmath34 allows us to study how @xmath3 depends on the strength of final state interactions .",
    "these studies are carried out at rhic energy ( au+au at @xmath39 tev ) and/or lhc energy ( pb+pb at @xmath40 tev ) for the impact parameters @xmath41  fm and @xmath42  fm , corresponding to approximately 0 - 10% and 30 - 40% most central events , respectively .",
    "we follow the procedure of extracting @xmath3 as documented in  @xcite .",
    "first , the correlation function for a given @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 range is constructed from all final state particles , and @xmath43 , @xmath44 values are calculated .",
    "second , a least - square minimization of these @xmath25 values following eq .",
    "[ eq : v1a ] is used to obtain @xmath45 for a given @xmath31 range , where the @xmath45 function is defined by its values at 9 @xmath5 points ( 0.5,0.7,0.9,1.1,1.5,2.0,3.0,3.8,4.6 gev ) via a cubic - spline interpolation procedure from root  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ] ( a ) and ( c ) show examples of such a study at rhic energy , with the fit overlaid with the @xmath25 from ampt for set - a with a 10 mb partonic cross - section .",
    "a pseudorapidity gap of 1.5 is imposed to suppress the short range correlations .",
    "the @xmath25 values for different @xmath29 selections cross each other and change sign as one increase @xmath1 , a feature qualitatively similar to the atlas data .    figure  [ fig:1 ] ( b ) and ( d ) show the @xmath25 values obtained from hijing , which has no final state interaction .",
    "they vary nearly linearly with @xmath46 , consistent with behavior expected for global momentum conservation .",
    "this suggests that the complex dependence of the @xmath25 on @xmath1 in the left panels is a natural consequence of final state interactions .",
    "note that the @xmath25 values for @xmath47 gev are similar between ampt and hijing , this is because @xmath48 is very close to zero in this @xmath5 range ( see figure  [ fig:2 ] ) , hence @xmath25 values are dominated by momentum conservation term according to eq .",
    "[ eq : v1b ] .",
    "figure  [ fig:2 ] shows @xmath45 extracted from the fit .",
    "the @xmath49 function crosses zero at low @xmath5 , with the crossing point of @xmath50 gev at rhic energy and 0.9 gev at lhc energy , respectively .",
    "since the total transverse momentum arising from dipolar flow is expected be zero , i.e. @xmath28  @xcite , the change of @xmath51 mainly reflects the change of the @xmath52 and @xmath53 ( value shown in the legend ) .",
    "one can show that if @xmath27 is a linear function of @xmath5 , the crossing point is @xmath54 .",
    "however , a change in the @xmath52 and @xmath53 should have little influence on the @xmath3 values at high @xmath5 ; there the @xmath3 values are more sensitive to transport properties of the medium .",
    "the @xmath45 increases with @xmath5 to a value @xmath55 at 2 - 3 gev , and then decreases at higher @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath49 values for @xmath41  fm and @xmath42  fm are comparable , consistent with the lack of centrality dependence in the initial dipole asymmetry  @xcite . the @xmath49 value at lhc energy is larger , consistent with a stronger collective flow at lhc .",
    "figure  [ fig:3 ] shows @xmath56 for set - a and set - b at different parton cross - sections tuned by changing @xmath34 .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath45 clearly grows with increasing cross - section .",
    "however the @xmath3 values are more sensitive to changes in @xmath33 : a change of @xmath37 for set - a to 0.33 for set - b almost leads to a 60% increase of the peak value of @xmath3 .",
    "results for set - b with a 1.5  mb cross - section agree better with the atlas data at low @xmath5 .",
    "however both sets fail to describe the trend of the data for @xmath57 gev .",
    "this reflects a limitation in the ampt model for predicting the behavior of @xmath11 at high @xmath5 : the jet quenching physics is important at high @xmath5 , but is not modeled correctly in ampt .",
    "similar studies for @xmath58 also found that the set - b 1.5  mb has the best agreement with the data for @xmath59 gev  @xcite .",
    "the original fitting method of atlas can be generalized to measure the @xmath6 dependence of @xmath3 in ampt .",
    "we first perform the 2pc analysis in bins of @xmath60 , and @xmath61 .",
    "the resulting 4-d dataset @xmath62 is then parameterized by : @xmath63 to directly obtain @xmath64 .",
    "a minimum @xmath65 separation for the pairs is imposed to suppress the short range non - flow correlations .",
    "therefore the total number of @xmath25 data points used in the fit depends on this gap requirement and the binning in @xmath5 and @xmath6 .    in the default fit",
    ", both @xmath49 and @xmath23 functions are assumed to be symmetric in @xmath6 i.e. @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "in addition , we also have @xmath68 .",
    "we divide the @xmath69 into 12 equally spaced @xmath6 bins and use the same 9 bins in @xmath5 as for fig  [ fig:1 ] and [ fig:2 ] .",
    "the fit uses a @xmath70 mesh in @xmath71 space with a simple linear interpolation , which has 54 independent mesh nodes due to symmetry in @xmath6 .",
    "this together with 24 parameters for @xmath23 , gives a total of 78 fitting parameters .",
    "the quality of the fit is generally comparable to those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "figure  [ fig:4 ] shows the @xmath6 dependence of the @xmath3 obtained this way for two @xmath5 bins .",
    "the error bands account for the statistical uncertainty as well as the variation of the fit result by changing the @xmath65 gap from 0.5 to 2.5 .",
    "the @xmath72 generally shows a weak @xmath6-dependence at rhic energy , especially in the more central collisions . at lhc energy ,",
    "however , the @xmath72 shows a small dip at mid - rapidity .",
    "the physics behind this dip is currently under investigation , but probably is related to the stronger longitudinal flow at higher collision energy .",
    "figure  [ fig:5 ] shows the values of @xmath73 plotted as a function of @xmath65 for @xmath42  fm at rhic and lhc .",
    "they fall approximately on a common curve for @xmath74 , suggesting that @xmath23 nearly depends only on @xmath65 for pairs with large rapidity separation .",
    "the values of @xmath23 at large @xmath65 are not sensitive to the @xmath65 gap used in the global fit ( compare the solid and open symbols ) , and they are three times larger than that calculated via eq .",
    "[ eq : v1b ] assuming @xmath75 at lhc ( right panel ) , but are comparable at rhic ( left panel ) .    in the original functional eq .",
    "[ eq : v1a ] , parameter @xmath23 is assumed to be a single number for each centrality class .",
    "figure  [ fig:5 ] clearly show that this is not the case in ampt , and the global momentum conservation contribution changes with @xmath65 .",
    "some of this dependence is due to the influence of the short range correlations such as jet fragmentation and resonance decay , which tend to give a negative contribution to @xmath23 at small @xmath65 .",
    "however , the values of @xmath23 still change with @xmath65 up to @xmath76 then seem to flatten out at higher @xmath65 , but at a level much bigger than that predicted by eq .",
    "[ eq : v1b ] .",
    "this may suggest that evaluating @xmath23 with all particles in the event might be incorrect . in the modified ep method of ref .",
    "@xcite , a @xmath5 dependent weight @xmath77 is calculated for each particle used in the ep calculation .",
    "note that if @xmath23 depends on @xmath6 of the two particles , @xmath53 and @xmath52 need to be calculated in bins of @xmath6 , instead of a single number calculated over the full @xmath6 range of the ep .",
    "in other words , the weight is a function of @xmath5 and @xmath6 : @xmath78 .",
    "in summary , we study the @xmath3 associated with the initial dipole asymmetry in the ampt model using @xmath79 obtained from the two - particle correlation technique .",
    "a global fit of the @xmath25 using the procedure from the atlas collaboration  @xcite allows the simultaneous extraction of @xmath27 and the global momentum conservation component .",
    "the excellent fit demonstrates that the complex pattern of the @xmath25 data from the model , which are similar to the atlas data , is a natural consequence of the interplay between final state interaction and global momentum conservation .",
    "the extracted @xmath3 function is negative at low @xmath5 , and increases with @xmath5 until 2 - 3 gev , qualitatively agreeing with the behavior predicted by the hydrodynamic models .",
    "the @xmath3 function shows very little centrality dependence but increases with collision energy and parton cross - sections , suggesting that its magnitude increases with the strength of the final state interactions . by choosing the parameters in ampt carefully , reasonable agreement with the atlas data",
    "can be achieved for @xmath59 gev , but not at higher @xmath5 .",
    "the fitting method is extended to directly extract the @xmath6 dependence of @xmath3 and the global momentum conservation component ( eq .  [ eq : v1c ] ) .",
    "the extracted @xmath3 shows a weak dependence on @xmath6 .",
    "the coefficient of global momentum conservation component is found to depend on @xmath31 and differs from that given by eq .",
    "[ eq : v1b ] . this extended method should allow the extraction of the @xmath32 and validation of the ep method ( it requires detector acceptance to @xmath80 , which is usually not satisfied in actual experiment ) .",
