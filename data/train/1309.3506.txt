    "fluid motion which is interacting with electromagnetic fields plays a central role for the dynamics in the interior and atmospheres of stars @xcite or in nuclear fusion @xcite .",
    "although less spectacular , such interactions also occur in flows of molten metals in technological applications ranging from the generation of monocrystals for silicon wafers to the production of steel and complex alloys for industrial manufacturing @xcite . understanding the basic mechanisms of how an electromagnetic field generates or suppresses fluid motion is a prerequisite for the efficient electromagnetic control of such technological processes .",
    "applying this knowledge may for example improve the purity of the materials .",
    "apart from flow control , electromagnetic fields can also be employed for flow measurement in conducting liquids .",
    "inductive flow meters determine the fluid velocity from the voltage induced across the flow as it traverses a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "this method is well - established and very accurate .",
    "however , it is not contactless but requires electrodes in the liquid .",
    "it is therefore not suited for hot and aggressive molten metals .",
    "several efforts of the last decade have , therefore , been devoted to the development of contact - less methods for such non - transparent liquids based on electromagnetic induction .",
    "examples of such methods are the contactless inductive flow tomography @xcite , the rotary flow meter @xcite and lorentz force velocimetry ( lfv ) @xcite .    in lfv , the currents which are induced in the flow by an external magnet system result in a braking force on the flow .",
    "conversely , the flow exerts a reaction force on the magnet on account of newton s third law .",
    "this lorentz force on the magnet depends on the velocity magnitude and distribution , and can be used for velocity measurement .",
    "the state of the art in lfv is largely limited to global measurements , i.e. , mean velocities or volume fluxes of the liquid metal flow .",
    "the utility of lfv for local measurement has been demonstrated only very recently for the wake behind a solid obstacle @xcite .",
    "it requires a localized field that pervades only a small portion of the flow domain , where the flow can be significantly modified by the lorentz force .",
    "further development of lfv for detailed , spatially resolved measurements requires a better understanding of such aspects .",
    "they have to be studied by direct numerical simulations ( dns ) since only dns can provide the fully resolved space - time evolution of three - dimensional liquid metal flows and lorentz force components that affect the motion . by means of dns , the _ local impact _ of the magnetic field and the related parameter dependencies can be studied systematically in laminar , transient or turbulent cases .",
    "because of the high computational cost of dns , this approach will remain limited to a moderate range of dimensionless parameters , i.e. , reynolds and hartmann numbers , @xmath0 and @xmath1 .    in recent years",
    ", computations of liquid - metal magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) flows have become more frequent , and a number of dns studies have been reported .",
    "typically , such works were concerned with effects arising from the anisotropic nature of the joule damping and from the specific mhd boundary layers at walls @xcite .",
    "instabilities of mhd boundary layers such as the hartmann layer , and the transition to turbulence have been analyzed numerically in ducts and channels for homogeneous magnetic fields @xcite . from the lfv perspective ,",
    "such investigations are of limited interest because the total lorentz force vanishes in the case of a homogeneous field .",
    "the aim of this article is to investigate the structure formation and the locally resolved lorentz force fields in a liquid metal duct flow in the presence of a magnetic point dipole field .",
    "the flow and magnetic field configurations are similar to recent laboratory experiments on lfv using liquid ingasn alloy at room temperature @xcite .",
    "we conduct three - dimensional dns based on the quasi - static approximation of the induction equation .",
    "this approximation applies for liquid metal flows with a high conductivity which are considered here and can be found typically in laboratory experiments and industrial applications @xcite .",
    "the induced magnetic field is then weak and does not modify the stronger primary magnetic field significantly .",
    "hence , the induced currents depend linearly on the velocity field and can be computed from ohm s law for a moving conductor with the electric field represented by a potential gradient .    in terms of the flow geometry , we will focus on a straight duct flow with square cross section as one of the simplest shear flow configurations .",
    "our choice of a magnetic dipole field is also guided by mathematical simplicity and by its rapid decay .",
    "a drawback is that it represents the far field of a typical permanent magnet , i.e. , it will not provide a very good approximation when such a magnet is placed close to the duct  @xcite .",
    "because of the rapid decay , the magnetohydrodynamic interaction of the dipole field with the flow is strongly localized and three - dimensional .",
    "we will demonstrate that it can cause a locally pronounced deflection of the velocity field for laminar flows , and that the wake of the dipole is characterized by vortical structures at higher velocities .",
    "for particular orientations of the magnetic dipole moment , transition to turbulence in the wake is observed at moderate reynolds numbers . in order to keep the parameter space manageable",
    "we only consider three basic orientations of the magnetic dipole moment , namely along the streamwise , spanwise and wall - normal directions .    the present study can be regarded as a continuation of the theoretical and numerical investigations reported in @xcite . in this previous work ,",
    "dynamic effects of the lorentz force on the flow were only significant in the creeping flow regime .",
    "as before , we shall not only consider the flow modification but also determine the electromagnetic force and torque on the dipole , which are of great interest from the perspective of lfv .    without reference to lfv",
    ", the flow modification by a localized magnetic field has also been investigated by other authors .",
    "@xcite have termed it magnetic obstacle in analogy with the flow around a solid obstacle .",
    "similar configurations have been investigated both experimentally and numerically @xcite .",
    "the magnetic fields in these works typically had a lower degree of spatial non - uniformity , and can not be characterized in such as simple way as a point dipole .",
    "a point dipole has been used for analytic investigations in cuevas et al .",
    "( 2006 )  @xcite , but for a quasi two - dimensional problem .",
    "in addition , force and torque on the magnet system were typically also not studied , and three - dimensional simulations were performed with relatively coarse grids ( e.g. votyakov et al .",
    "( 2008 )  @xcite ) .",
    "we therefore also attempt to significantly improve on these earlier works in terms of numerical resolution .",
    "and @xmath0 investigated .",
    "each point denotes a separate direct numerical simulation .",
    "the distances @xmath2 of the dipole from the top surface of the duct is @xmath3 ( circles ) or @xmath4 ( squares ) measured in units of the half width of the duct . ]    naturally , the geometric parameters such as position and orientation of the magnetic dipole , have a strong influence on the acting forces .",
    "however , a detailed investigation of this point would go beyond the scope of this article . indeed",
    ", we will focus on the influence of the hydrodynamic reynolds number @xmath0 and the hartmann number @xmath1 . in brief",
    ", the reynolds number describes the ratio of the inertial to the viscous forces in the flow ( mathematical definitions of both numbers will be given in eqns .",
    "( [ eq : redef ] ) and ( [ eq : hadef ] ) ) .",
    "the hartmann number is a measure for the strength of the magnetic field and its influence on the flow .",
    "both parameters are investigated in a wide range , as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : hare ] .",
    "since it is understood that the position of the dipole is important for the spatial development and transformation of the flow , we consider two particular distances between dipole and duct .",
    "in particular , a very short distance is used for the lower reynolds numbers , as this allows a direct comparison with recent laboratory experiments by heinicke et al .",
    "( 20012 )  @xcite . at higher reynolds numbers",
    "the magnetic dipole is positioned further away from the top wall of the duct .",
    "this changes the magnetic field configuration inside the flow and excites vortices that will eventually cause the flow to become turbulent .",
    "the article is organized as follows .",
    "first , we introduce the geometry and setting of the problem under consideration in sec .",
    "[ sec : defin ] and explain the numerical method in sec .  [",
    "sec : nummethods ] .",
    "second , we present the results for low reynolds number to describe the basic deformations of the flow field in sec .",
    "[ sec : steady_state_solutions ] in the stationary regime .",
    "this regime exists for the lower reynolds numbers and persists when both , @xmath1 and @xmath0 , are increased to a certain point . in sec .",
    "[ sec : wake_instabilities ] , we discuss the transition to turbulence when the reynolds number is further increased .",
    "conclusions and a brief outlook are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we consider the flow of an electrically conducting fluid in a square duct of side length @xmath5 , i.e. , the characteristic length @xmath6 will be defined as the half width of the duct .",
    "we use cartesian coordinates , where the streamwise direction is denoted as @xmath7 , the spanwise direction as @xmath8 and the vertical , wall - normal direction as @xmath9 .",
    "the duct is exposed to the inhomogeneous magnetic field of a point dipole located at a vertical distance @xmath10 above the top surface of the duct . in dimensional units ,",
    "the dipole field at position @xmath11 is given by @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the magnetic dipole moment and the unit vector @xmath14 its orientation .",
    "the other quantities are the vacuum permeability @xmath15 and the distance @xmath16 between @xmath11 and the dipole position at @xmath17 . for nondimensionalization of the problem",
    "we use the maximum value @xmath18 of the dipole field within the duct as unit of magnetic induction .    based on @xmath19 and @xmath6 as unit of length ,",
    "the nondimensional magnetic flux density of the dipole is @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the nondimensional distance between dipole and duct and nondimensional quantities are indicated by a prime . in the following , we shall use nondimensional quantities exclusively and will therefore omit the prime in subsequent equations .",
    "a sketch of the setup in dimensionless units is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] .",
    "the origin is chosen to be at the centerline of the duct .",
    "thus the duct extends in @xmath8 and @xmath9-direction from -1 to 1 .",
    "the position of the dipole is given by @xmath22 , i.e. , in the vertical center plane .",
    "a key parameter of our study is the orientation of the magnetic moment of the point dipole , which is referred to as the dipole orientation .",
    "we will call the orientation streamwise if @xmath23 , spanwise if @xmath24 and vertical if @xmath25 . in this article",
    ", we only consider these three main orientations , but preliminary studies have shown that oblique orientations lead to more complex structures in the flow which will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "as mentioned above , the dipole field approximates the far field of a small permanent magnet .",
    "close to the permanent magnet the dipole is not a very accuate model for the actual field .",
    "nevertheless , the differences are not substantial .",
    "we have measured the field distribution around a cube magnet of 1 cm side length and compared it with a point dipole .",
    "the dipole moment was chosen such that the magnetic induction agrees between the cube magnet and the dipole at 1 cm distance from its center . the magnetic induction",
    "was compared along the dipole axis for distances greater than 1 cm . at identical positions , the relative error in magnetic induction between dipole and cube magnet never exceeded 30% .",
    "details can be found in tympel ( 2013 )  @xcite .    before listing the equations that will be solved numerically , we want to recall the basic physical principle which causes the deflection of the fluid motion . inside the square duct",
    ", there is a laminar pressure - driven flow of an electrically conducting liquid .",
    "the magnetic dipole close to the duct induces electric currents , which are confined to the flow due to the insulating walls .",
    "these currents give rise to two effects .",
    "first , they induce a secondary magnetic field . this secondary magnetic field will be much weaker than the primary field of the point dipole .",
    "in many applications in metallurgy , one may assume that the secondary magnetic field is negligible .",
    "this idea coincides with the assumption that the _ magnetic _ reynolds number @xmath26 @xcite is very small .",
    "therefore , we can neglect the secondary field and apply the quasistatic approximation .",
    "physically , this means that the flow is unable to deform the field lines of the magnetic dipole .",
    "there is no feedback from the flow onto the magnetic field .",
    "second , the currents induced by the primary magnetic field of the dipole generate a lorentz force within the liquid .",
    "it gives rise to a strong deformation of the velocity profiles ( cf .",
    "[ sec : steady_state_solutions ] ) and even triggers a transition to turbulence ( cf .",
    "[ sec : wake_instabilities ] ) . due to newton",
    "s third law , a counter force acts on the magnetic dipole which is of same magnitude , but of opposite sign as the total force @xmath27 on the liquid .",
    "recent works by heinicke et al .",
    "( 2012 )  @xcite were focused on the determination of this force and the derivation of mean flow properties from its magnitude .",
    "here , we will focus on the particular impact of the lorentz force on the local velocity field and the resulting flow transformation .",
    "in addition to the geometry parameters , the problem depends on two dimensionless parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the reynolds number @xmath0 is defined as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a mean streamwise velocity and @xmath30 the kinematic viscosity .",
    "the strength of the magnetic field is quantified by the hartmann number @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the mass density and @xmath33 the electric conductivity .",
    "in contrast to the case of a uniform magnetic field , the definition of @xmath1 in the present case is ambiguous because of the non - uniform magnetic flux density .",
    "we choose the maximum of the magnetic flux density @xmath19 inside the duct .",
    "it occurs at the upper boundary of the duct right below the dipole at point @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the governing equations of the problem will be given in nondimensional form below .",
    "we use @xmath29 as unit of velocity and @xmath6 as unit of length .",
    "the pressure , electric current and potential are given in units of @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "to model the interaction between the lorentz force @xmath39 and the conducting liquid , we solve the incompressible navier - stokes equations @xmath40",
    "@xmath41 @xmath42 the induced currents are given by ohm s law @xmath43 where the electric field is represented by the negative gradient of the electric potential @xmath44 .",
    "it is determined by the condition @xmath45 , which corresponds to the poisson equation @xmath46 equations ( [ eq : ohm ] ) and ( [ eq : poisson_potential ] ) constitute the quasi - static approximation @xcite with an imposed field @xmath47 . for the velocity ,",
    "we use no - slip boundary conditions , i.e. , @xmath48 at all walls .",
    "furthermore , all walls are insulating with zero wall - normal currents , and we therefore apply @xmath49 where @xmath50 denotes the corresponding normal direction perpendicular to the walls . in the streamwise direction , we apply periodic boundary condition in our simulations . for higher reynolds numbers , we model in- and outflow conditions with the help of the so - called fringe force as described below in sec .  [ sec : nummethods ] .",
    "our dns are performed using the code from @xcite .",
    "the equations of motion are discretized on a structured mesh by an explicit second - order finite - difference scheme with a collocated grid arrangement .",
    "the incompressibility constraint is satisfied by a standard projection method .",
    "the formulations proposed by @xcite and @xcite are incorporated into the code making the present numerical scheme conservative for mass , momentum and electric charge .",
    "we use a hyperbolic - tangent based stretching to refine the grid in the boundary layers , i.e. , the grid is non - uniform in the spanwise @xmath8- and wall - normal @xmath9-directions . in particular ,",
    "the stretching function is given by @xcite @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the coordinate on a uniform grid , @xmath8 denotes the transformed coordinate , while @xmath53 is the stretching coefficient .",
    "equivalent stretching is applied in the @xmath9-direction . in the streamwise @xmath7-direction ,",
    "we use periodic boundary conditions and a uniform grid spacing , and can thus apply fast fourier transformations ( fft ) .",
    "this allows us to solve the poisson equations for the pressure and the electric potential with the 2d - poisson solver fishpack ( @xcite ) .",
    "verifications of the code versus a spectral code and more details on the algorithm can be found in @xcite .",
    "the periodic streamwise boundary conditions simplify the solution of the poisson equation .",
    "fishpack is comparatively fast and uses a direct method .",
    "the resulting drawback is to ensure that a laminar unperturbed duct flow profile is maintained upstream of the magnetic dipole .",
    "thus , the computational domain has to be increased with increasing reynolds number when the flow is below the threshold to transition to turbulence . in case of low reynolds numbers , @xmath54 ,",
    "a periodicity length of @xmath55 was sufficient for the laminar duct profile to be completely reestablished at the end of the domain . for @xmath56 , a length of @xmath57",
    "was required .",
    "this procedure increases therefore the computational cost rapidly when @xmath0 is enhanced .    for higher reynolds numbers , e.g. @xmath58 , the flow may become turbulent and this strategy breaks down completely .",
    "the conflict with the periodic boundary conditions is circumvented by the application of an additional fringe force which acts in the final downstream section of the duct and relaminarises the transient or turbulent flow @xcite .",
    "it is sometimes also referred to as the sponge method and is frequently used in studies of turbulent boundary layers @xcite .",
    "the fringe method is based on an artificial body force @xmath59 .",
    "this fringe force is added to the right hand side of the navier - stokes equations  ( [ eq : navier - stokes - with - force ] ) .",
    "it affects the flow only when the prefactor @xmath60 is non - zero .",
    "the shape of the prefactor function is in our cases given by a step function with smoothed edges @xcite .",

    "these tests showed that @xmath60 has to be smooth and periodic .",
    "the particular shape is not important .",
    "typical values in the calculation are @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "preliminary results with this method were already presented in tympel et al .",
    "( 2012 )  @xcite .",
    "an example for the resulting velocity profiles is shown in figure  [ fig : fringe_principle ] . here , the transformation of the flow by the magnetic dipole for @xmath4 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 is illustrated .",

    "it is not possible to perform a detailed parameter study with such fine grids .",
    "we performed a grid sensitivity study for three typical parameter sets which are summarized in table [ tab : grid ] . in order to resolve the boundary layers and the steep gradients of the magnetic field close to the point dipole properly",

    "for instance in case of @xmath86 , @xmath72 , @xmath3 and a spanwise oriented dipole  which represents the basic setting in sec .",
    "[ sec : steady_state_solutions ]  the difference between the resulting lorentz forces of the applied grid with @xmath87 and the finest grid with @xmath88 points is approximately 2% . for the transient flow at higher reynolds numbers and the parameter studies in sec .",
    "[ sec : wake_instabilities ] , we attempt to achieve resolutions similar to gavrilakis ( 1992 )  @xcite or huser and biringen ( 1993 )  @xcite .",
    "this results in a resolution of @xmath89 grid points for a streamwise domain length of @xmath90 .",
    "in addition , the total force of this grid is only 0.6% lower than for the finest grid .",
    "furthermore , the resolution study shows that the same physical effects ( e.g. the vortex shedding that is described in sec .",
    "[ sec : wake_instabilities ] ) are still obtained with a coarser resolution of @xmath91 .",
    "all values for @xmath92 are time - averaged over 3168 snapshots .",
    "to exclude errors due to the time averaging , the grid sensitivity study was repeated for @xmath93 .",
    "again , the total force differs only by 0.7 % for the used grid .",
    "in addition , the velocity field itself was compared along a line right below the dipole ( @xmath78 and @xmath94 ) : the maximal error is less than @xmath95 for all velocity components and less than @xmath96 for all components of the lorentz force density , respectively .",
    "in the following , we discuss the behavior of the flow in case of low reynolds numbers . as a first step , we take a closer look at the particular deformation of the velocity profile for a reynolds number @xmath97 and a hartmann number @xmath98 .",
    "it is observed that differences in the deflection depend on the orientation of the magnetic moment of the dipole .     for reynolds number @xmath58 , hartmann number @xmath72 and dipole distance of @xmath4 .",
    "red dashed lines indicate the magnetic field lines .",
    "arrows denote the local main direction of the magnetic field and the currents . in the hartmann layers ( top corners of the duct ) ,",
    "the resulting lorentz force points then in the same direction as the mean velocity . in the centerline , the lorentz force brakes the fluid and  if strong enough  drives the vortex formation.,scaledwidth=99.0% ]    .",
    "total duct length is @xmath99 and @xmath86 , @xmath72 , @xmath4 .",
    "three different orientations of the dipole are presented : top  spanwise , middle  streamwise and bottom  vertical magnetic moment ]     +   +    for low reynolds numbers , pressure gradient and lorentz forces balance in the core of the flow provided that the magnetic field is sufficiently strong .",
    "this solution is usually not compatible with the conditions at walls .",
    "when the magnetic field has a sufficiently strong wall - normal component , the tangential force balance at a wall gives rise to an electromagnetic boundary layer called hartmann layer .",
    "the velocity difference across this layer is related to an electric current parallel to the wall and perpendicular to the outer velocity @xcite .",
    "hartmann layers can be formed whenever their thickness is small compared with the lateral variation of the flow and magnetic field .",
    "their appearance is therefore not restricted to uniform fields .    in the problem at hand , the hartmann layers are regions where the velocity at the outer edge is controlled by the current in the layer .",
    "these currents in the hartmann layers are generated by the electromotive force @xmath100 in the core .",
    "since the flow is dominated by the streamwise velocity component , we can infer the current pattern from the distribution of the magnetic dipole field .",
    "the hartmann layers then typically indicate a local acceleration of the flow , which affects the velocity distribution in its vicinity . in the following ,",
    "we shall focus on the characteristic current distribution for a velocity field dominated by the streamwise component .",
    "the associated lorentz forces and hartmann layers for this current distribution indicate how the flow field is transformed .",
    "let us consider the case of a magnetic dipole in spanwise direction , i.e. , @xmath101 .",
    "the magnetic field is perpendicular to the flow direction and parallel to the top wall when the dipole is not too close to the duct .",
    "the magnetic field is of high magnitude and strongly inhomogeneous in the cross section directly below the dipole , i.e. , at @xmath78 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch_of_principle ] ) .",
    "the induced current density is the result of the electromotive force @xmath100 and the induced electric field represented by the gradient of the electric potential . in the bulk",
    ", the currents qualitatively conform to the electromotive force @xmath100 .",
    "differences arise near the walls where the currents have to close because of @xmath102 .",
    "figure  [ fig : sketch_of_principle ]  ( a ) shows that there are two stagnation points in the streamline pattern of the electric currents based on the laminar velocity distribution .",
    "they are close to the surface .",
    "figure  [ fig : sketch_of_principle ]  ( b ) shows that the essential properties of the current distribution are preserved for the modified flow field .",
    "the streamlines have been obtained from a numerical simulation and are projected into the cross section .",
    "what may look like a sink or a source in fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch_of_principle ]  ( b ) can be explained as a result of the projection on the two - dimensional cross section .    with the obtained current density , one may now estimate the resulting lorentz force distribution @xmath103 in the duct which will result in a braking force in the bulk of the flow .",
    "it should be emphasized that this braking force is also present in the region directly below the dipole . here , the magnetic field has the largest magnitude . if this force is strong enough , which is the case when the hartmann number is sufficiently large ,",
    "a local flow reversal is observed .",
    "the resulting vortices in figs .",
    "[ fig : distortion ] ( top ) and  [ fig : low_re_streamlines_verschiedene_orientierungen ] ( a ) mark now the areas with strong spanwise magnetic field . in the top corners",
    ", the situation is different .",
    "as the current density field lines close here , the resulting lorentz force accelerates the flow .",
    "thus , local hartmann layers are created .",
    "these layers are of interest when the influence of the hartmann number is investigated in sec .",
    "[ sec : turb_ha ] .",
    "contrary to the classical hartmann flow configuration @xcite , the local hartmann layer is present at the top wall and practically absent at the bottom wall . as a consequence ,",
    "the flow distortion decreases rapidely when moving from the top to the bottom wall .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : low_re_streamlines_verschiedene_orientierungen ] by a second set of streamlines seeded at a distance of 0.05 length units above the bottom wall .",
    "nonetheless , local hartmann layers also appear for the other dipole orientations where the normal component of the magnetic field is sufficiently strong at a wall . in case of a streamwise dipole orientation ,",
    "strong hartmann layers are found at the centerline ahead and behind the dipole position .",
    "much less pronounced layers are also found at the sides .",
    "for the same reasons , one observes a well pronounced local hartmann layer positioned directly below a vertical dipole , i.e. , @xmath104 . here , the main component of the magnetic field is in vertical direction and thus perpendicular to the flow direction and to the top wall .",
    "these layers can be observed in figs .",
    "[ fig : distortion ] ( bottom ) and [ fig : low_re_streamlines_verschiedene_orientierungen ] ( c ) .",
    "in addition , two vortices are created in the top corners .",
    "one may understand the case of the vertical dipole as counterpart of the spanwise case as it forms hartmann layers where the other shows areas of reversed flow and vice versa .",
    "moreover , the vertical dipole induces spanwise oriented currents in the bulk as it is the case for a homogeneous vertical field .",

    "figure  [ fig : momentum_balance_low_re ] shows all terms of the balance equation ( [ eq : integrals_bilanz ] ) for the three dipole orientations .",
    "we can see that the contribution to the lorentz force is mainly based on the presence of the local hartmann layers .",
    "therefore , the forces are much stronger for the vertical case than for the spanwise one .",
    "the strongest contribution of the lorentz force comes from the streamwise oriented dipole . here , two hartmann layers are clearly visible , ahead and behind the dipole positioned at @xmath78 .",
    "it also becomes clear that it is mainly the pressure gradient which balances the lorentz force .",
    "the nonlinear term @xmath79 is small due to the low reynolds number of @xmath86 . in sec .",
    "[ sec : wake_instabilities ] , we will come back to this point and will see that the nonlinear term has a stronger influence as expected for higher reynolds numbers . before increasing the reynolds number , we study the influence of the hartmann number at fixed @xmath86 .",

    "an example for the distortion is shown in fig .",

    "the graphs compare the distortion for several hartmann numbers which are indicated in the legend .",
    "two effects are observed .",
    "first , there is almost no distortion of the flow for @xmath114 . in this range ,",
    "the resulting forces behave to a good approximation as in the kinematic case for an unperturbed flow .",
    "they are also comparable with the experiments by heinicke et al .",
    "( 2012 )  @xcite in this parameter range .",
    "second , the maximal amplitude of @xmath115 increases approximately linearly with the hartmann number for @xmath116 .",
    "nevertheless , one can assume a saturation of this deformation for very high hartmann numbers due to the finite duct geometry .",
    "furthermore , the starting point of the deflection is shifted upstream with increasing hartmann number . in particular",
    ", it changes from @xmath117 for @xmath118 to @xmath119 for @xmath120 . in all cases the distortion subsides at approximately four characteristic lengths downstream of the dipole position .",
    "therefore , the curves become slightly more symmetric for higher hartmann numbers .",
    "let us now focus on the integral forces and torques .",
    "therefore , we define the total lorentz force by @xmath121 and the total torque as @xmath122 with @xmath123 .",
    "calculations are done for the three main dipole orientations .",
    "the dependence of the integral forces on reynolds and hartmann number was found to be practically the same for all orientations .",
    "more interestingly , the absolute values of the forces were found to differ at the same values of hartmann and reynolds numbers .",
    "the streamwise oriented dipole gave always stronger forces than the wall - normal vertical one .",
    "it has to be recalled that the hartmann number is based on @xmath19 , the maximal value of the magnetic field inside the duct , and not on the magnetic moment of the dipole .",
    "thus , in an experiment using a real magnet , it is always found that a rotation of the magnetic dipole from vertical to streamwise orientation will cause a decrease of the forces simply because such a rotation will decrease the hartmann number by a factor of two in correspondence with eq .",
    "( [ eq : dipolefield_bmax ] ) . in all cases ,",
    "the spanwise oriented dipole will give the weakest force .",
    "the integral torque component behaves in the same way as the forces .",

    "we observe that the drag force is higher than the lift force .",
    "the data in fig .",

    "hartmann number values the growth with @xmath1 becomes weaker .",
    "as expected , one finds that the drag force @xmath125 and that the torque component @xmath126 .",
    "these power laws are caused by the fact that @xmath127 is a prefactor to the lorentz force term in the momentum balance .",
    "the third power law for the lift force is found as @xmath128 .",
    "this behavior of the lift force is not immediately obvious .",
    "we explain it by the following argument .",
    "let @xmath129 be a solution to the navier stokes equation  ( [ eq : navier - stokes - with - force ] ) for a given hartmann and reynolds number .",
    "similar to a perturbation expansion in weakly nonlinear flows , we divide the velocity field in three parts , @xmath130 here , @xmath131 is the base flow , @xmath132 describes the distortion of the base flow and @xmath133 stands for a higher - order nonlinear term .",
    "the base flow @xmath131 is the flow in the limit of small interaction parameter @xmath127 and low reynolds number .",
    "it is supposed to be a steady flow which is solely driven by the pressure gradient .",
    "thus , @xmath131 is the solution of @xmath134 this solution is the laminar flow @xmath113 which can be derived analytically  @xcite . as it was shown in @xcite , the lorentz forces for a given laminar profile and for the full navier - stokes equation  ( [ eq : navier - stokes - with - force ] )",
    "are almost the same in case of hartmann and reynolds numbers below certain thresholds .",
    "the present case of @xmath118 and @xmath135 satisfies these thresholds and the approximation with a laminar profile @xmath113 gives a good agreement for the drag component of the lorentz force .",
    "however , the lift force is zero for a laminar velocity profile .",
    "the second term @xmath136 describes the deflection due to the dipole .",
    "it is again an approximation which holds for small reynolds numbers .",
    "again , this flow is steady .",
    "viscous forces are balanced by the lorentz force @xmath137 it is clear from this equation that the amplitude @xmath138 .",
    "we note that an additional pressure correction is necessary to maintain incompressibility . the contribution @xmath132 does not give a contribution to the lift force .",
    "this can be shown with the following argumentation based on stokes flow .",
    "assume that there is a non - zero lift force @xmath139 .",
    "on the one hand , the linearity of the equations implies that a sign reversal of pressure and @xmath140 , respectively , results in an opposite force . in particular , the lift force would reverse , i.e.",
    ", one would obtain @xmath141 . on the other hand ,",
    "the problem has mirror symmetry with respect to the @xmath142 plane containing the dipole , i.e. , a reversal of flow direction should change the sign of the drag force @xmath77 but not the sign of the lift force .",
    "for this reason @xmath143 , i.e. , the lift force has to vanish .",
    "the third part of the decomposition , @xmath133 , is the nonlinear part which mainly reflects effects of inertia .",
    "this term is an approximation , but presents the realistic flow pattern for moderate reynolds numbers . rewriting eq .",
    "( [ expansion ] ) to @xmath144 in the navier - stokes equation  ( [ eq : navier - stokes - with - force ] ) for the steady flow case and neglecting all terms of order @xmath145 leads to @xmath146 from this equation , one can estimate that @xmath147 .",
    "thus , @xmath148 which gives rise to the lift force @xmath149 and thus the expected hartmann number dependence of @xmath150 for the lift force .",
    "we denoted in this estimate by @xmath151 the nondimensional characteristic gradient variation scale given in units of the duct half width .",
    "it was also numerically verified that the lift force vanishes when the nonlinear term @xmath152 is artificially set to zero . in this case , the flow was symmetric in streamwise direction .",
    "thus , the numerical test confirms that the nonlinear term is responsible for non - symmetric pattern in the flow and for the lift force .",
    "we also note that a more formal argument could be given using a double expansion in the two small parameters @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "besides the hartmann number , the second control parameter , @xmath0 , will affect the structures of the flow .",
    "following directly from the definition of the lorentz force , we verify the dependencies @xmath153 and @xmath154 , respectively , which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : low_re_fxfzty_per_re ] for several hartmann numbers .",
    "furthermore , we see that the lift force @xmath139 is constant at a given hartmann number for @xmath155 as already discussed above . in case of higher reynolds number , the lift force data decay steeper than @xmath156 .    with increasing reynolds number the contributions of the nonlinear advection term will increase and manifest in an increasing distortion of the flow .",
    "we observe that the distortion in the wake , as measured by eq .",
    "( [ eq : distortion_meassure ] ) , decays almost exponentially , i.e. , as a function @xmath157 with respect to the streamwise direction obeying a spatial decay rate @xmath158 .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : distortion_ha100 ] for a hartmann number of @xmath72 in a logarithmic - linear plot .",
    "the first observation is that the maximum of the distortion is decreasing with increasing reynolds number  an effect of the decaying interaction parameter @xmath127 .",
    "the decay of the maximal value may also be considered as an effect of the nonlinear term .",
    "a numerical test case shows that the value does not decrease if the nonlinear term is artificially switched off . when the data are presented in a logarithmic scale , as in the lower right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : distortion_ha100 ] , the exponential decay is clearly visible .",
    "the fit of these data with an exponential function results in a spatial decay rate which is approximately inversely proportional to the reynolds number .",
    "the reynolds number dependence of the decay rate can be rationalized from the following consideration for steady flow .",
    "the lorentz force term @xmath159 is a localized force term and will not affect the decay in the wake sufficiently far downstream from the dipole position , i.e. , we can drop it in the wake .",
    "the navier - stokes equations simplify to @xmath160 we now represent the distortion as @xmath161 . if we use this representation , then the dominant term on the left hand side becomes @xmath162 .",
    "on subtracting the equation for the laminar flow itself we obtain @xmath163 where the pressure contribution @xmath164 serves to maintain incompressibility .",
    "if we further approximate the laminar velocity distribution by its mean value @xmath165 we eventually have @xmath166 following usual boundary - layer approximation ideas based on @xmath167 one can further neglect the second derivative with respect to @xmath7 in the laplacian .",
    "the problem then effectively reduces to a diffusion problem @xmath168 where we have introduced @xmath169 . using separation of variables ,",
    "it is clear that the decay of @xmath170 with @xmath171 is ultimately determined by the largest eigenvalue @xmath172 of the two - dimensional laplacian , i.e. , @xmath173 therefore , the measure of distortion has to decay approximately exponentially .",
    "the last steps of our argumentation are more heuristic because we neglect the remaining pressure term",
    ". a justification of this step might be not straightforward , but we suppose that it is justified because it amounts to a projection on the space of solenoidal functions , which should not interfere with the gist of the argument .",
    "we further note that the spatial decay is independent of the orientation of the magnetic dipole .",
    "the numerical simulations show that this is approximately the case for @xmath174 and @xmath0 reaching from 10 up to 2000 .",
    "we also remark that the decay is clearly visible only at large distances from the dipole position . for @xmath175 , it is difficult to identify a clear exponential decay of @xmath176 ( cf .",
    "[ eq : distortion_meassure ] ) within the computational domain because of the slower decay of higher modes .    to summarize the results for the lower reynolds numbers : we explained why different transformations of the flow are observed for different dipole orientations leading to the formation of local hartmann layers and areas of reversed flow due to strong lorentz forces .",
    "the strength of the forces and their effect on the deflection of the flow in dependence on the hartmann number was also analyzed .",
    "the total drag force is found to be proportional to @xmath177 and the total lift force is proportional to @xmath150 in the present reynolds number regime . when the reynolds number is increased , we observe that the length of the wake is increased .",
    "it was also shown why the spatial downstream decay of the deflected flow in the wake is proportional to @xmath156 . in the next section",
    ", we will see how the vortex formation process changes when the dipole triggers a transition to turbulence as the reynolds number is increased .",
    "in this section , we study time - dependent flow structures which start to appear at reynolds numbers of about 2000 and higher and for hartmann numbers above 80 .",
    "we will observe vortex shedding for cases when the dipole is positioned sufficiently far in a distance of @xmath4 from the top surface of the liquid .",
    "for smaller distances than @xmath178 the flow is always stationary in the range of reynolds numbers which could be covered here @xmath179 .",
    "therefore , we will restrict our study in this section to the case with @xmath180 which generates qualitatively new features compared to the last section .",

    "[ fig : streamlines_re ] .",

    "the wake undergoes a transition to turbulence for @xmath218 .",
    "the vortex structure below the dipole position remains similar for all three cases .",
    "the @xmath188-criterion reveals here the differences ( cf .",

    "only one vortex is pronounced . in case of @xmath219 ,",
    "additional vortices are produced in front of the dipole position , at @xmath220 , and during the vortex shedding .",
    "the amount and the strength of these vortical structures is enhanced at @xmath71 .",
    "the principal mechanism of the vortex shedding remains as explained above .",
    "the higher the reynolds number the shorter are the generated hairpin structures in the wake .",
    "besides the differences in the shape of the flow , the oscillation time is longer with increasing @xmath0 . for @xmath92",
    "an oscillation time of 3.168 was calculated , while for @xmath218 it is 3.636 nondimensional time units .",
    "the time signal for both cases is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : force_per_t ] .",
    "we conclude from this section that the vortex shedding is a complex mechanism initiated by the lorentz force .",
    "the reynolds number determines how likely it is that the flow forms vortical structures and transforms into a turbulent flow in the wake . as a final step to this parameter study ,",
    "it remains to investigate the influence of the hartmann number on the created vortex .      to investigate the influence of the hartmann number",
    ", we consider reynolds number of 2000 and vary the hartmann number between 25 and 130 . for very small hartmann number , there is almost no deformation of the flow visible .",
    "[ fig : streamlines_ha ] shows examples of the streamlines for several hartmann numbers . for @xmath221",
    ", one may already observe the local hartmann layers , but the lorentz force is not strong enough to create a flow reversal .",
    "such reversed flow is indicated by the streamlines from @xmath222 and higher .",
    "a turbulent wake is observed for @xmath223 .",
    "the dependence of the lorentz force on the hartmann number is summarized in fig .",

    "similar to the investigations in sec .",
    "[ sec : steady_state_solutions ] , one finds the same power laws for the total forces , i.e. , @xmath125 and @xmath128 . the vortex shedding does not influence the power law as the oscillations of @xmath77 and @xmath139 are of the order of 1% and 10% of the forces , respectively .    as an additional characteristic",
    "the frequency of the vortex shedding can be obtained from the time signal of the force . regarding the dipole as a magnetic obstacle allows one to compare the frequency of vortex shedding with typical values for flows generated past a solid cylinder",
    "( see e.g. cuevas et al ( 2006 )  @xcite ) .",
    "the nondimensional parameter for such comparison would be then the strouhal number @xmath224 here , @xmath225 denotes the frequency , @xmath165 the mean velocity and @xmath226 the characteristic length of the obstacle , e.g. the radius of the cylinder .",
    "whereas the frequency and the velocity are known in our setting , it is not obvious how to determine the characteristic length @xmath226 of the magnetic obstacle .",
    "a good estimate for the size of the magnetic obstacle is the area in which the flow is detached from the wall , that was already discussed above ( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig : seperationline_re2000_time ] ) .",
    "this region is stretched along the streamwise direction and the shape may change in time due to the vortex shedding .",
    "we define the characteristic length @xmath226 of the magnetic obstacle as the maximal spanwise width of the area that is enclosed by @xmath227 at @xmath35 .",
    "the obtained widths increase with increasing hartmann number as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : width_per_ha ]  ( a ) .",
    "in addition , the width is decreased with increasing reynolds number .",
    "it is worth to note the influence of the interaction parameter @xmath228 in the following example .",
    "the width is approximately the same for the simulations at @xmath58 with @xmath229 and at @xmath71 with @xmath72 .",
    "both cases have similar interaction parameter of @xmath230 and @xmath231 , respectively .",
    "this estimate does not hold for the regime without vortex shedding .",
    "furthermore , the frequency is found to decrease with increasing hartmann number .",
    "this behavior was also observed for the two - dimensional flow with a small magnetic obstacle @xcite . the strouhal number in cuevas et al .",
    "( 2006 )  @xcite was obtained with a characteristic length that was fixed by the size of the small magnet .",
    "therefore , they describe a decrease of the strouhal number for increasing hartmann number with values around @xmath232 . in a similar parameter study , kenjeres ( 2012 )",
    "@xcite finds for the same interaction parameters as in our study @xmath233 which is calculated from power spectra at several positions close to the magnetic obstacle . in the present work",
    ", the width of the area of reversed flow is used as a characteristic length of the magnetic obstacle .",
    "the width @xmath226 is therefore a dynamic parameter that depends on @xmath1 .",
    "if the hartmann number is enhanced , the resulting strouhal number increases with a gentle slope and reaches a saturation around @xmath234 ( cf .",
    "[ fig : strouhal_per_ha ]  ( b ) for @xmath58 ) .",
    "the result can be compared to the flow around a solid cylinder . there , the strouhal number is of the order @xmath235 @xcite .",
    "dousset and potherat ( 2008 )  @xcite investigated the influence of a homogeneous magnetic field on the flow around a cylinder .",
    "in the regime of high reynolds number , the strouhal number was found to decrease with increasing hartmann number .",
    "thus , the homogeneous magnetic field damps the vortical structures . in our case ,",
    "the inhomogeneous localized magnetic gives rise to the vortex formation and subsequent shedding .",
    "[ fig : strouhal_per_ha][fig : width_per_ha ]     as calculated in ( [ eq : enstrophy ] ) is linear dependent on the hartmann number .",
    "this behavior is originated in the local hartmann layers .",
    "data is given for @xmath58 , @xmath4 and spanwise oriented dipole . ]",
    "apart from the strouhal number , it is desirable to have an additional quantity for the deflection of the flow that is caused by the dipole .",
    "the aim is therefore to characterize the structures in fig .",
    "[ fig : streamlines_ha ] .",
    "a possible approach is to measure the vorticity , @xmath236 , of the flow . for this",
    ", we consider the enstrophy over a duct fraction right below the dipole which is defined as @xmath237 ^ 3 } \\frac{1}{2 } | \\nabla \\times \\vec u |^2 d v.\\ ] ] as the wake contains turbulent vortices , the integral is not applied to the whole domain .",
    "thus , we focus on the area that is directly influenced by the dipole .",
    "[ fig : enstrophy_per_ha ] shows that the enstrophy increases linearly with the hartmann number , which is caused by an increase of the vorticity @xmath238 in the vortex as well as the hartmann layers .",
    "the strongest contribution comes from the partial derivative @xmath239 , which reaches maximal magnitudes in the hartmann layer , as already mentioned above ( cf .",
    "[ fig : seperationline_re2000_time ] ) .",
    "an integration shows that the integral @xmath240 ^ 3 } \\frac{1}{2 } | { \\partial_{z } } u_x |^2 d v$ ] gives already about 80% of the magnitude of the total enstrophy @xmath241 .    to explain the linear dependence on the hartmann number , we recall the properties of the hartmann layers in homogeneous magnetic fields .",
    "it is known from the analytic solution of the hartmann channel flow  @xcite that @xmath242 , where @xmath9 measures the distance from the wall .",
    "we can therefore estimate @xmath243 in the hartmann layer .",
    "the width of the hartmann layer is given by @xmath244 .",
    "therefore , the integration of the enstrophy leads to @xmath245 .",
    "it has to be remarked here , that this explanation is only valid for the total enstrophy of duct flow in a uniform magnetic field when @xmath1 is large .",
    "while the hartmann layers show linear dependence of the total enstrophy on the hartmann number , there are additional contributions from the shercliff layers proportional to @xmath246 . as a conclusion ,",
    "the qualitative presentation of the flow structures in terms of the enstrophy ( [ eq : enstrophy ] ) fails to provide details on the reversed flow and the vortex structures .",
    "nevertheless , it gives a good criterion for the strength of the local hartmann layers .",
    "in this work , we have investigated the influence of a localized inhomogeneous magnetic field on liquid metal flow in the quasi - static approximation .",
    "our study focuses on the fundamental aspects of the structure formation .",
    "therefore we use the simplest setting , a point dipole for the _ localized _ magnetic field and a simple shear flow in a square duct .",
    "it should therefore be considered as a paradigm for many realistic liquid metal flows .",
    "the magnetic field gives rise to a lorentz force in the liquid that deforms the streamlines .",
    "depending on the orientation of the dipole , areas of reversed flow and localized or local hartmann layers are formed at the top surface due to strong lorentz forces .",
    "the notion of local hartmann layer is considered as a generalization of the canonical hartmann flow and layer which arises due to the finite spanwise extension in the square cross section of the duct and the locality of the magnetic field .",
    "we have provided a systematic parameter dependence study which unraveled the local effects of the dipole field on the flow .",
    "the parameter study is focused on the influence of the reynolds and the hartmann number .",
    "as expected the flow remains laminar and stationary for low reynolds numbers .",
    "when the reynolds number is increased , we observe that the length of the wake is increased .",
    "we showed that the spatial downstream decay rate of the deflected flow in the wake is proportional to @xmath156 .",
    "for @xmath247 , the spanwise oriented dipole in a distance of @xmath4 triggers vortex shedding in case of hartmann number above 80 .",
    "the flow becomes time - dependent and eventually turbulent .",
    "the hartmann number affects the total lorentz force .",
    "the drag component is proportional to @xmath177 , while the lift force behaves like @xmath150 for @xmath248 .",
    "the latter is connected with the nonlinearity in the navier - stokes equation . in case of time - dependent flow with a spanwise oriented dipole",
    ", the vortex shedding leads to a sinusoidal force signal .",
    "the frequency of the signal corresponds to a strouhal number that increases with increasing hartmann number .",
    "the strouhal number saturates around 0.16 which is comparable with classical flow past a cylinder . nevertheless , it is not only the primary vortex , that has strong influence of the flow structure , but also the local hartmann layers . due to the formation of these boundary layers , the enstrophy of the deformed flow increases linearly with the hartmann number .",
    "our study opens some new perspectives for flow manipulation and thus also for flow control .",
    "the described setting can be used to trigger turbulence in a laminar flow .",
    "this can be applied , e.g. , for mixing injected substances or particles with the main flow .",
    "such applications as well as experimental investigations of the problem have to be done with magnetic fields that are localized and inhomogeneous but not necessarily of the shape of a point dipole .",
    "future numerical studies should include a turbulent inflow to model the experimental setting more realistically .    to obtain a complete understanding of the mechanism of the vortex shedding ,",
    "the stability study can be extended .",
    "this could be provided by adding prescribed perturbations to a deformed but stationary flow",
    ". a more sophisticated way would be the direct optimal growth analysis as used by barley et al .",
    "( 2008 )  @xcite or a sensitivity study like giannetti and luchini ( 2007 )  @xcite .",
    "finally , the study should be extended to capture the influence of geometry parameters such as the distance of the dipole or its orientation . here",
    ", the question arises whether the vortex shedding is still present if the dipole is oriented in an oblique orientation and what the optimal local hartmann layers are to trigger flow transition .",
    "in addition , the symmetry of the given setting could be broken if the dipole is not positioned in the centerline of the duct , but with a certain offset .",
    "the influences of walls could also be studied by using rectangular ducts with non - square cross - section or pipes .",
    "these investigations open a huge parameter space that has to be considered in future works .",
