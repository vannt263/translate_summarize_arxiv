    "the discovery of strong gravitational lensing in q0957@xmath6561 @xcite opened up the possibility of using strong lens systems to study cosmology and astrophysics .",
    "roughly a few hundred strong lens systems produced by massive galaxies have been discovered to date , with quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , radio sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) appearing as source populations . these samples of strong lenses have been extensively used to constrain dark energy , the density profile of lensing galaxies , and the evolution of massive ellipticals ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "it is expected that large new samples of strong lenses will be obtained in future wide - field imaging surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for instance , the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ; * ?",
    "* ) will observe a 20,000  deg@xmath7 region with a final limiting magnitude of @xmath8 , which is considerably wider and deeper than existing optical imaging surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "more importantly , future imaging surveys such as lsst s will pay particular attention to the acquisition of time - domain data , mostly in order to study transient objects including supernovae ( sne ) .    in this paper ,",
    "we present detailed predictions of the numbers of time - variable sources we can expect to be strongly lensed in ongoing and future time domain optical imaging surveys .",
    "we focus on time - variable sources for two reasons .",
    "first , time domain data enable us to identify strong lenses by taking advantage of time variability @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed to find strong lenses by looking for `` extended variable sources '' in time - domain data , and argued that this technique should be very efficient due to the low levels of contamination in the difference images .",
    "second , time - variable sources allow us to measure time delays between multiple images ; these time delays contain rich information on the lens potentials as well as cosmology ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the obvious and traditional example of such a strongly lensed time - variable source is a quasar ( qso ) . of @xmath9",
    "gravitationally lensed quasars currently known , time delays have been measured for only @xmath10 ( see * ? ? ? * for a recent compilation ) .",
    "a major advance offered by the upcoming imaging surveys is their potential not only to discover new lenses but also monitor them as well . some of the survey telescopes we will consider do have larger static surveys planned , but we do not consider them on the grounds that if they are wide enough to be competitive , they will be limited by the required monitoring follow - up .",
    "synoptic surveys ( such as those designed to discover supernovae ) should provide some estimate of the lens time delays  we are careful to point out where this may not be the case .",
    "the scope of several planned surveys allows us also to consider sne as time - variable sources .",
    "while a distant sn highly magnified by a foreground massive cluster has recently been identified @xcite , no multiply - imaged sn has yet been discovered .",
    "however , the possibility of discovering such strongly - lensed sne by future time - domain surveys such as the joint dark energy mission ( jdem ) and the lsst has been pointed out @xcite .",
    "a particularly enticing feature of lensed sne is that , if they are type - ia , the `` standardizable candle '' nature of the peak brightness allows a direct determination of the lensing magnification factor , which breaks the degeneracy between the lens potential and the hubble constant @xcite .    indeed",
    ", we expect any large sample of time delay lenses to be useful in constraining cosmological parameters . the idea of using strong gravitational lens systems with time - variable sources to measure the hubble constant is an old one @xcite",
    "; in fact , the time delays between images provide a way of measuring the `` time - delay distance '' to the lens .",
    "this quantity is a combination of the angular diameter distances to the lens , source , and between the two , and while primarily sensitive to @xmath11 , it does also depend on the other cosmological parameters ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* for a recent high - precision measurement ) .",
    "attempts to measure the hubble constant from the statistical analysis of the current lensed quasar sample @xcite have yielded values consistent with constraints from other cosmological probes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in future , larger samples covering a wide range of lens and source redshift permutations should provide interesting constraints on the dark energy equation of state as well as hubble constant @xcite . in this work",
    ", we revisit the forecast constraints on dark energy parameters for the lsst , using new , realistic predicted distributions of strong lenses .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec : calc ] we describe the ingredients of our lens abundance calculation , including our assumptions about both the lens and source populations .",
    "we then present our predictions for various survey depths and areas in section  [ sec : survey ] .",
    "we then present monte carlo realisations of some fiducial survey lens catalogues in section  [ sec : mock ] , and use these to explore the potential of some of these in constraining cosmological parameters via the time delay distances to the lenses in section  [ sec : cosmo ] . after a brief discussion ( section  [ sec : discuss ] ) we conclude in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "we take as the parameters of a fiducial cosmological model @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "we denote the angular diameter distance from observer to lens as @xmath17 , from observer to source as @xmath18 , and from lens to source as @xmath19 .",
    "we compute the expected number of strong lensing in future surveys in the usual way , integrating the lensing cross section of each galaxy over the galaxy population and redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "as source objects , we consider both qsos and sne , for which measurements of time delays between multiple images will be possible due to their time - variable nature .",
    "an appropriate modeling of the lens galaxy population constitutes an essential part of the prediction for lensing rates .",
    "we mostly follow the model used in @xcite to compute the expected number of strong lensing by massive galaxies in future surveys . throughout the paper",
    "we conservatively consider only elliptical galaxies ( e / s0 ) as lensing objects ; these likely comprise @xmath20 of the total lensing probability @xcite .",
    "we assume that the mass distribution of each elliptical galaxy is described by a singular isothermal ellipsoid ( sie ) , whose convergence is given by @xmath21 @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the one - dimensional velocity dispersion of the lensing galaxy .",
    "it has been shown that this model describe the mass distributions of observed strong lensing elliptical galaxies very well @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath24 , the so - called dynamical normalisation , is related to the three - dimensional shape of lensing galaxies . following @xcite , we assume that there is an equal number of oblate and prolate galaxies , and adopt the average value of the normalisations in each of the oblate and prolate cases . as in @xcite ,",
    "we assume a gaussian distribution for the ellipticity @xmath25 , with a mean of 0.3 and dispersion of 0.16 . the distribution is truncated at @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "in addition to the sie model lens galaxy , we include external shear to account for the effect of the lens environment ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the lens potential of external shear is given by @xmath28 we assume the magnitude of the external shear , @xmath29 , follows a log - normal distribution with mean 0.05 and dispersion 0.2  dex , which is broadly consistent with the level of external shear expected from ray - tracing in @xmath30-body simulations @xcite .",
    "the orientation of the external shear , @xmath31 , is assumed to be random .",
    "although the external convergence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is also vital particularly for time delays , we do not include it explicitly in the calculation .",
    "instead , we will later consider its effects via an effective lens density profile slope , which will be the subject of detailed discussion .",
    "for the velocity function of early - type galaxies , we adopt that derived from the sdss data @xcite , which is fitted by a modified schechter function of the following form : @xmath32\\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma   ( \\alpha/\\beta)}\\frac{dv}{v}. \\label{eq : vf}\\ ] ] here , ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36)@xmath37(@xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 )",
    ". we do not include redshift evolution , i.e. , we apply the mass distribution and velocity function to galaxies at any redshifts .",
    "such a non - evolving model has been shown to reproduce the abundance of strong lenses in the latest radio @xcite and optical @xcite lens surveys , although see , e.g. , @xcite for an analysis that takes evolution into account .      the lensing probability for a given source at redshift @xmath42 and with luminosity  @xmath43 is given by @xmath44_{v = v(\\theta ) } , \\label{eq : lensprob}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the image separation between multiple images",
    ", @xmath46 indicates the redshift of lensing objects , and @xmath47 denotes the velocity function of lensing galaxies given by equation ( [ eq : vf ] ) . unless otherwise specified , we adopt the minimum image separation of @xmath48 and maximum image separation of @xmath49 .",
    "although a non - negligible fraction of strong lenses have image separations larger than @xmath50 , such lensing is caused by groups or clusters of galaxies rather than a single massive galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this work we focus on galaxy - scale lenses ( for which simple isothermal density profiles are good models ) , for two reasons .",
    "firstly , they do dominate the lens abundance , which we will need to be high in order to beat down the statistical errors on the cosmological parameters .",
    "secondly , the image positions are easier to fit with simple models , reflecting the fact that massive galaxies are older , more relaxed systems than groups and clusters . on low mass scales , lenses with image separation less than @xmath51",
    "were deemed to be too difficult to measure , particularly in the ground - based surveys . indeed ,",
    "when we consider the yields of specific surveys below , we take into account the predicted image quality explicitly .",
    "the lensing cross section @xmath52 is determined by the structure of the lens potential . as discussed in  [ sec : lensgal ] , we adopt an sie plus external shear as the lens potential of each galaxy . to take account of the magnification bias , we compute the biased cross section @xcite as follows : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the source luminosity function and @xmath55 is the magnification factor .",
    "the integral is performed over the region where multiple images are generated . in practice , we compute the biased cross section numerically using monte carlo sampling of multiple images .",
    "we solve the lens equation using the software package glafic ( m. oguri , in preparation ) .",
    "we compute the biased cross sections for double ( two - images ) , quadruple ( quad ; four - images ) , and naked cusp ( three - images ) lenses separately in order to study the image multiplicity . for double lenses ,",
    "we place a condition that the flux ratio must be larger than @xmath56 and perform the integral over the region that satisfies this condition .",
    "this is because asymmetric double lenses with large flux differences are sometimes very difficult to locate in observations as a result of dynamic range problems caused by the brighter image .",
    "the choice of the magnification factor @xmath55 depends on the way in which strong lens systems are identified in the survey data .",
    "bearing in mind the promising variability selection techniques suggested by @xcite and @xcite , we adopt the magnification factor of the fainter image for double lenses as @xmath55 . for quad and cusp lenses ,",
    "we adopt the magnification factor of the third - brightest image , because the second - brightest image is sometimes located very close to the brightest image if it is produced near the fold catastrophe ( where only one eigenvalue of magnification matrix is zero ) .",
    "the two images in a fold - configuration lens may be hard to deblend because of their small angular separation , which may result in failure to identify them as strongly lensed .",
    "another reason is that the third brightest image tends to arrive first , a feature we will return to later (  [ sec : delay ] ) .    once the lensing probability for a given source is computed , it is straightforward to calculate the expected strong lens abundance .",
    "we obtain the differential number distribution of strong lenses by integrating the lens probability over the source population : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is given by equation ( [ eq : lensprob ] ) and @xmath59 denotes the absolute magnitude of sources .",
    "the limiting absolute magnitude is simply converted from the magnitude limit of the survey considered .",
    "the volume factor @xmath60 is given by @xmath61 with @xmath62 being the solid angle corresponding to the survey area .",
    "finally , the total number of strong lenses is @xmath63 note that we did not impose any restrictions on the luminosity of the lensing galaxies .",
    "if a lens galaxy is much brighter than lensed images , such lens systems may prove difficult to identify from the imaging data alone .",
    "this effect becomes particularly important for lensing of faint sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , since we are considering cadenced surveys where the strong lens search will make use of differenced survey images @xcite , we assume that those systems with bright lensing galaxies can still be successfully identified because the lens galaxy component ( as well as any lensed host galaxy light ) should be cleanly subtracted . in practice , a bright lens galaxy will act as an additional source of noise ; we neglect this here , since many of the surveys we consider are ground - based and will have background - limited images .",
    "we adopt the standard double power - law for the quasar luminosity function . specifically , we adopt the following parametric form : @xmath64 here @xmath59 refers to the absolute @xmath65-band magnitude of quasars .",
    "we fix the faint end slope of @xmath66 and the bright end slope of @xmath67 which was obtained in the combined analysis of the sdss and 2df @xcite . at @xmath68 , however , we modify the bright end slope and adopt the shallower slope of @xmath69 which was suggested by observations @xcite .    -band quasar luminosity function ( eq . [ [ eq : lf_qso ] ] ) , compared with the observed quasar luminosity function from the sdss dr3 @xcite .",
    "we present results at three different redshifts , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 , in order to show that our model successfully reproduces the abundance of the sdss quasars for a wide range of redshifts .",
    "luminosity functions for @xmath70 ( @xmath73 ) are shifted by @xmath74  dex ( @xmath75  dex ) to avoid overlap .",
    "[ fig : lf_qso ] ]    in addition to this change of slope , we model the redshift evolution of the luminosity function as pure luminosity evolution .",
    "specifically , the break absolute magnitude @xmath76 is described as @xmath77 @xmath78 where the zero - point value of @xmath76 , as well as the normalisation of the luminosity function @xmath79  mpc@xmath80 , is taken from @xcite .",
    "the parametric form of the redshift evolution , @xmath81 , is taken from @xcite with some modifications to achieve a better match to the observed evolution of the quasar luminosity function .",
    "we then determine the values of the parameters @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 to reproduce the quasar luminosity function from @xmath85 to @xmath86 obtained from the sdss data release 3 ( dr3 , * ? ? ?",
    "we find the best fit values to be ( @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84)=(2.98 , 4.05 , 1.60 ) , which we adopt throughout the paper . in figure  [ fig : lf_qso ]",
    ", we compare our best - fit luminosity function with the sdss result of @xcite .    in order to convert the @xmath65-band absolute magnitude to the apparent magnitude",
    ", we need the appropriate k - correction .",
    "we adopt that presented by @xcite .      the rate of occurrence of sne is closely related to the star formation rate . in this paper",
    "we adopt the cosmic star formation rate presented by @xcite , @xmath87,\\ ] ] which is essentially the best - fit to the observed star formation rates assuming the initial mass function of @xcite .",
    "recent studies of the host galaxies of sne ia suggest that delay times ( @xmath88 ) of sne ia can not be described by a single value .",
    "it has sometimes been assumed that sne ia are drawn from two populations , `` prompt '' ( tracing star formation rates ) and `` old '' ( tracing stellar masses of host galaxies ) sne @xcite .",
    "however , such a two - component model may fail to explain the observed low high - redshift sne ia rates ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is naturally expected that more realistic models have widely distributed @xmath89 , because theoretically the delay time should depend on various parameters such as the mass of the companion star and the metellicity ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . in this paper",
    ", we use the result of @xcite who constrained the distribution of @xmath88 assuming a power - law : @xmath90 since they found no strong evidence for the presence of the `` prompt '' ( @xmath91 ) component , we do not consider it",

    "they are associated with the death of massive stars whose life time is significantly shorter than the typical cosmological time scale , which suggests that the sn rate of core - collapse sne is simply proportional to the cosmic star formation rate : @xmath96 where @xmath97 was derived assuming that core - collapse sne are produced in the stellar mass range @xmath98 , together with the initial mass function of @xcite . following @xcite , we adopt constant relative proportions for four subclasses of core - collapse sne . then sn rates are written as @xmath99 where @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 @xcite .",
    "note that we do not consider sn1987a - like sne that are very faint compared with the other core - collapse sne .",
    "recent analysis suggests that the fraction of type - iip sne may actually be much higher @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig : snrate ] , we compare our model of sn rates with recent measurements .",
    "we find that our model is reasonably consistent with the observed sn rates , particularly given the additional systematic errors they involve .",
    "the figure indicates that our model of sn rates is uncertain at the factor of @xmath104 level , suggesting that our predicted numbers of lensed sne will be similarly uncertain .",
    "in particular , our model appears to slightly over - predict the core - collapse sn rate , though it is possible that current observations may miss a fraction of core - collapse sne given their wide range of intrinsic luminosities .",
    "the uncertainty should be even larger at redshift @xmath105 for type - ia sne , and @xmath106 for core - collapse sne , where no measurements of sn rates have been obtained .",
    "we need not only sn rates , but also the brightness distributions of sne in order to make predictions of the lensed sne abundance . in",
    "what follows the magnitude of sne refers to the peak magnitude , i.e. , the magnitude when the sn is brightest . again following @xcite",
    ", we assume the absolute magnitudes of sne are gaussian - distributed ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "note that the luminosity function of sne ( eq . [ [ eq : lf_sn ] ] ) differs from that of qsos ( eq . [ [ eq : lf_qso ] ] ) in that the former is in fact the number rate ( number per unit time ) .",

    "the lensing rate is @xmath129 , and does not depend very much on @xmath125 due to the conflicting effects of increasing mean qso redshift and decreasing magnification bias .",
    "we note that the lensing rate is lower than observed in the cosmic lens all - sky survey ( class ) , @xmath130 @xcite , presumably because of the quite different magnification bias it involves ( for instance , in the class the total magnification factor is used for the magnification bias ) .",

    "the corresponding deep surveys , or a spaced - based jdem / snap survey , will provide time delay measurements , but only for @xmath172 lensed quasars , because of their small combined field - of - view .",
    "the lsst is unique because it has _ both _ the wide field - of - view to cover many quasars and the frequent time domain sampling for monitoring of lens systems , allowing us to obtain time delay measurements for @xmath145 lensed quasars",
    ". it will be quite challenging to find lensed sne in ground - based surveys before lsst , as the expected number of lensed sne discovered is only @xmath173 .",
    "in contrast , the very deep monitoring by a jdem / snap survey would allow us to locate @xmath0 lensed sne in total , despite the relatively small field of view of @xmath174  deg@xmath7 .",
    "the lsst will also be powerful for detecting lensed sne ; our calculation indicates that the lsst will discover @xmath175 lensed supernovae during its 10-year survey .",
    "here we compute the expected number of strong lenses , and their distributions with lens and source property , in a different way from the standard technique described in  [ sec : calc ] .",
    "essentially it is a semi - analytic technique based on monte - carlo realisations of lens and source populations , and is an extension of the method used in @xcite to predict the all - sky distribution of large einstein radii produced by massive clusters .",
    "in essence , we perform the necessary integrals by monte - carlo integration , and keep the sample points drawn from the target distribution .",
    "the goal is to produce mock catalogues of lenses for a given survey , which can then be used to investigate the feasibility of various science projects .",
    "the specific procedure is as follows .",
    "first we randomly generate a list of sources in a given survey area to a given depth , according to the adopted source luminosity function . to allow for the magnification by strong lensing",
    ", the limiting magnitude of the source catalogue needs to be deeper than the actual magnitude limit of the survey .",
    "we adopt @xmath176  mag deeper limit than the survey magnitude limit for generating the source catalogue .",
    "this is sufficient , particularly given our use of the fainter image magnification factor in computing the magnification bias .",
    "each source realisation contains information on the redshift and apparent magnitude ( without lensing magnification ) only .",
    "since we ignore any spatial correlations between sources , the whole source population is characterised just by a surface number density .",
    "we then randomly generate a list of lenses according to the model described in  [ sec : lensgal ] .",
    "for each mock lens galaxy , we consider the rectangular region with an area of @xmath177 ^ 2 $ ] , where @xmath178 is given by equation ( [ eq : tein ] ) with @xmath179 , randomly distribute source objects using the pre - generated catalogue , and for each source solve the lens equation to see if it is multiply - imaged .",
    "again , the lens equation is solved using the software _ glafic _ ( m. oguri , in preparation ) .",
    "for multiply - imaged sources , we check whether they satisfy the detection criteria ( the survey limiting magnitude , image separation , and flux ratio ) , and record only lens systems which survive these criteria . in this way we can generate mock catalogues of lensed sources for a particular survey .    ) .",
    "[ fig : zsdist ] ]    , but the redshift distributions of lensing galaxies are shown .",
    "[ fig : zldist ] ]    although the new monte - carlo technique tends to be more time - consuming than the traditional analytic approach , it has several important advantages .",
    "( 1 ) in this approach we can add more parameters to the lens model with little additional computational cost . in the traditional analytic approach , adding additional lens parameters requires an additional integral , particularly if the distributions of the parameters are not independent of each other .",
    "this exponential growth in run time with model complexity is in marked contrast with the monte - carlo approach , in which the cpu time required scales approximately linearly with the number of model parameters .",
    "( 2 ) it is straightforward to include even quite complicated lens selection functions , e.g. , those dependent on many observables such as flux ratios , image separations , time delays , and the properties of lensing galaxies . ( 3 ) from the resulting mock catalogue we can examine the expected distributions of lens and source parameters quite easily .",
    "this is important because the population of strong lenses generally differs from the population of general lens and source populations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and yet we would very much like to use the former to understand the latter .       for double (",
    "_ solid _ ) and quad ( _ dotted _ ) lenses , obtained from the mock lens catalogue",
    ". _ lower panel : _ the probability distribution of @xmath180 , where @xmath181 is the position angle of the lensing galaxy and @xmath31 is the position angle of external shear .",
    "since we assumed random distributions for @xmath181 and @xmath31 , the original unbiased ( non - lens ) population has a flat distribution of @xmath180 .",
    "[ fig : et ] ]    as a specific example , in this paper we present the mock catalogue of lensed qsos and sne expected for the baseline survey planned with lsst ( see table  [ table : surveys ] for the survey parameters ) . in practice ,",
    "the catalogue is 5 times ( qsos ) or 10 times ( sne ) over - sampled in order to reduce shot noise .",
    "the catalogue contains all the necessary information for each mock lens , including the properties of lenses and sources , image positions , magnifications , and time delays between image pairs .",
    "first , we examine the redshift distributions , to check the validity of the monte - carlo technique .",
    "figure  [ fig : zsdist ] compares the source redshift distribution of the mock lenses with the analytic result obtained from equation ( [ eq : dndzs ] ) .",
    "the reasonable agreements of the distributions assure us that the monte - carlo technique is indeed feasible and reliable .",
    "the total number of strong lenses in the mock catalogue is @xmath182 for lensed qsos and @xmath183 for lensed sne ( the errors refer to the @xmath184 poisson error ) , which is again in good agreement with the analytic result shown in tables  [ table : lqsos ] and  [ table : lsne ] . in figure",
    "[ fig : zldist ] we show lens redshift distributions which are again in good agreement .    as discussed above ,",
    "the mock lens catalogue is useful in studying the lensing bias , i.e. , the difference of the lens population from the normal population .",
    "as practical examples , in figure  [ fig : et ] we show the distributions of the lens ellipticity , and of the alignment between the lens galaxy and external shear , for double and quad lenses separately .",
    "we find that the lensing galaxies of quad image systems are @xmath185 more elliptical than those of double lenses .",
    "this result is broadly consistent with @xcite who showed such a difference using the analytic approach .",
    "it appears that there is no significant difference in the distributions of external shear between double and quad lenses .",
    "however , we find that the relative orientation of lensing galaxies and external shear is biased : for quad lenses the direction of external shear is more likely to be aligned with the major axis of the lensing galaxy , whereas for double lenses the direction of external shear is more likely to be aligned with the minor axis .",
    "this bias can easily be understood by the well - known approximate degeneracy between galaxy ellipticity and external shear ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the predicted distributions of time delays are important in order to assess the measurability of time delays from future time - domain surveys . in figure",
    "[ fig : dmdt ] we show the expected distributions of time delays and magnitude differences for strongly lensed image pairs , derived from our lsst mock lens catalogue . for double lenses , typical time delays",
    "are @xmath186  months .",
    "lensed sne have somewhat shorter time delays on average than lensed qsos , partly because of their lower redshifts and the stronger effect of the magnification bias . in most cases",
    "the brighter images arrive first , as is expected from simple spherical mass models , but in some cases the arrival order is inverted , i.e. , the fainter images arrive first . in either case",
    "the detection of first arrival images is assured because of our use of the fainter image for computing the magnification bias .        for quad lenses the situation is more complicated because there are three independent image pairs . however , in figure  [ fig : dmdt ] we can clearly see a general trend that the first arrival image tends to be fainter than the second and third arrival images ( @xmath187 and @xmath188 ) , and tends to be brighter than the fourth arrival image ( @xmath189 ) .",
    "thus we expect that the first image to arrive is most likely the third brightest image ; this provides support for our choice of the third brightest images for computing the magnification bias , because it assures the detection of the first lensed sn image to arrive .",
    "the appearance of this first sn image close to an early - type galaxy can act as an initial trigger , but two sne are likely to be needed to confirm the system as a lens ( and not a pair of sne in the lens galaxy itself ) . the time delay between the first image and the subsequent images will still need to be measured , since the delay between images 2 and 3 will often be very short .",
    "our result indicates that typical time delays for quad lenses range from @xmath173  day for the shortest delay to @xmath190  month for the longest delay .",
    "in this section , we use our mock lsst lens catalogue to explore one particular application of a future time - delay lens sample : the measurement of the hubble constant , and also other cosmological parameters .",
    "we follow the methodology proposed by @xcite to combine a number of time delay measurements .",
    "the technique was adopted also by @xcite to discuss future constraints from time delays . in brief",
    ", we introduce a reduced time delay defined by @xmath191 where @xmath192 denotes the distance of image @xmath65 from the center of the lens galaxy , and study its behavior as a function of the asymmetry @xmath193 and the opening angle @xmath194 $ ] . while the reduced time delay @xmath195 becomes unity when the lens potential is exactly isothermal , external perturbations , non - isothermality , and substructures induce scatter in @xmath195 .",
    "we construct a subsample of lensed quasars and sne for our statistical analysis from the mock lens catalogue .",
    "first , we restrict the image separation range to @xmath196 .",
    "the upper cut is meant to remove lens systems which are significantly affected by groups / clusters .",
    "we do not use lenses with @xmath197 because the detection and characterisation of lensing galaxies might be difficult for such small - separation lens systems .",
    "we also limit the lens redshift to @xmath198 ( see also figure  [ fig : zldist ] ) , beyond which the 4000 break of lensing galaxies comes in the @xmath199-band and therefore it becomes much more difficult to study the lensing galaxies without deep near - infrared images .",
    "next , for simplicity we consider only the double image lenses that dominate the lsst lens sample .",
    "one of the reasons for this is our choice of the third brightest images for computing magnification bias , which suggests that we may not be able to measure some of quad time delays without deeper follow - up monitoring . in either case ,",
    "our forecast constraints are conservative in the sense that additional quad lenses should only improve the constraints ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "finally , we use only lenses with the asymmetry @xmath200 , in which the effects of various perturbations on @xmath195 are modest and stable @xcite .",
    "these cuts leave a sample of 1542 lenses ( 1476 lensed qsos and 66 lensed sne ) for our forecast study .",
    "the sample has average lens redshift @xmath201 ( where we also give the standard deviation of the sample ) and average source redshift @xmath202 ( see also figure  [ fig : zldist ] ) , which are reasonably similar to the simple gaussian distributions assumed in @xcite and @xcite , although it should be kept in mind that these two redshift distributions are not independent but are naturally correlated .",
    "the error on @xmath195 comes both from measurement uncertainties and from model uncertainties ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we assume measurement errors of @xmath203  days and @xmath204 .",
    "the assumed time delay measurement error is the same as the one adopted by @xcite , which was based on simulations by @xcite .",
    "we note that time delay measurements in the optical waveband are complicated by microlensing for both lensed quasars ( as * ? ? ?",
    "* showed ) and lensed supernovae . @xcite",
    "discuss the extent to which microlensing can bias time delay measurements in lensed supernovae .",
    "while we should be optimistic about achieving 2-day precision given the wealth of additional imaging and spectroscopic data we can anticipate gathering on these precious systems , this is a topic requiring further research .    based on the monte - carlo simulations of @xcite , we adopt the model uncertainty of @xmath205 which comes mostly from external shear and the scatter in the radial density slope . in this paper , we assume no error on the lens and source redshifts , which corresponds to the situation where all redshifts are measured spectroscopically .",
    "see @xcite for the effect of photometric redshift errors on cosmological parameter estimates , which appears to be modest compared with lens potential uncertainties .    as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "the main source of systematic error is the unknown mean logarithmic slope of the radial density profile of the lensing galaxies .",
    "the parameter  @xmath206 for each lens is the effective slope of the lens potential , that includes the effect of the external convergence ( @xmath207 corresponds to an effectively isothermal potential , @xmath208 ) .",
    "we include the mean slope @xmath209 as an additional nuisance parameter .",
    "we include the effect of changing @xmath209 by adopting the scaling relation , @xmath210 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and assign it a gaussian prior .",
    "we adopt the fiducial value of @xmath211 , and marginalise over @xmath209 to obtain constraints on cosmological parameters .",
    "we explicitly explore the impact of this assumption in section  [ sec : cosmo : results ] .",
    "we obtain expected constraints on cosmological parameters using the fisher matrix approach .",
    "we compute chi - squared as @xmath212 ^ 2}{\\sigma(\\log \\xi)^2}.\\ ] ] here @xmath213 is the quadratic sum of measurement and model uncertainties .",
    "the summation is over the 1542 mock lenses .",
    "then the fisher matrix for the parameter set \\{@xmath214 , @xmath215 , @xmath216 } is calculated as @xmath217 here we adopt the standard parametrisation of the dark energy equation of state of the form : @xmath218 to complement the strong lensing data , we include the expected constraints from cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) measurements and distance - redshift relation measurements from ( unlensed ) type - ia supernovae .",
    "we compute the cmb fisher matrix @xmath219 from upcoming planck data using the simplified approach described in @xcite . in the lsst era",
    ", we can expect this to be the basic prior pdf for dark energy studies @xcite .",
    "for the sne , we estimate expected constraints from a jdem / snap survey assuming the redshift distribution of sne in the final subsample given in @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we add 300 local supernovae at @xmath220 , and include both statistical and systematic errors in computing the fisher matrix @xmath221 .",
    "in doing so , we include a nuisance parameter , @xmath222 , which corresponds to the absolute magnitude of type - ia supernovae , and marginalise over it .    to summarise , assuming a flat universe , we consider the following 8 parameters : \\{@xmath223 , @xmath224 , @xmath225 , @xmath226 , @xmath209 , @xmath227 , @xmath228 , @xmath222}. note that the time delays depend only on the first 5 of these parameters .",
    "once the fisher matrices are calculated , we obtain the parameter covariance matrix as @xmath229 , and display the corresponding marginalised constraints as ellipses containing 68% of the probability implied .    -@xmath224 plane ( _ upper panel _ ) and the @xmath223-@xmath226 plane ( _ lower panel _ ) .",
    "ellipses show 68% confidence regions for various combinations of expected constraints from the planck satellite ( cmb ) , type - ia supernovae in snap ( sn ) , and time delays in lsst ( @xmath230 ) .",
    "thin ellipses are constraints from cmb+@xmath230 , but assumes a much weaker mean slope prior of @xmath231 instead of the fiducial value of @xmath232 .",
    "[ fig : cons ] ]      we show the marginalised constraints on the cosmological parameters of interest in figure  [ fig : cons ] .",
    "we find that the lsst strong lens time delays , combined with the planck constraints , provide marginalised @xmath184 uncertainties ( 68% confidence intervals ) of @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 . if we include the jdem / snap sne constraints , we obtain @xmath233 , @xmath234 , and @xmath235 .",
    "although the constraints from time delays are less tight than those from the sne , time delays still improve the constraint on the dark energy parameters because of the different degeneracy directions .",
    "this point is particularly clear in the @xmath223-@xmath226 plane , where the two constraints are almost perpendicular with each other .",
    "one way to view this is that future supernova surveys can be enhanced by strong lens time delay distance measurements .",
    "we also consider the case where we have a much weaker prior on the mean radial density slope @xmath209 : if the prior pdf for this parameter is ten times broader than in our fiducial case , @xmath231 , the resulting constraints from time delays become much weaker ( see figure  [ fig : cons ] ) and hardly improve future constraints on dark energy from type - ia sne .",
    "this highlights the importance of accurate prior knowledge on lens potentials when deriving cosmological constraints from time delays .",
    "the slight rotation of the ellipse when the prior on @xmath209 is broadened is a result of the time delay dataset contributing less strongly to the joint fit ",
    "lack of knowledge of the mean density profile slope leads to lensing being downweighted as a cosmological probe .",

    "the vertical dotted lines indicate our fiducial prior value , @xmath211 .",
    "[ fig : fom ] ]    indeed , the results presented here depend crucially on the width of the prior on the mean slope , @xmath237 . in figure",
    "[ fig : fom ] , we show how the constraints on dark energy are affected by changing @xmath237 .",

    "we find that time delays would not improve upon the constraints from a jdem / snap sne survey if @xmath238 , which suggests that we need to determine the mean radial slope of galaxy density profile to better than @xmath239 in order to use time delays in lsst as a future cosmological probe . in the limit of perfect prior information on  @xmath209",
    ", we see that the lsst time delay sample could improve the de fom by a factor of 1.74 , from 215 to 375 .",
    "in this paper , we focused on cadenced surveys , mainly because of the interest in strong lens time delays for use in measuring cosmological parameters , and the promising technique to find such lenses from their time variability @xcite .",
    "as discussed in  [ sec : surveys ] , however , some future wide - field optical imaging surveys will lack sufficient time domain sampling frequency to measure time delays . these surveys will still be useful for locating many lensed quasars , and possibly lensed sne as well , but they will require extensive follow - up monitoring observations to measure the time delays .",
    "we note that some planned optical imaging surveys will be completely static , i.e. , observing each field only once .",
    "previous lens surveys , however , have convincingly shown that we can still identify lensed quasars by checking the colour and morphology of quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "high resolution , space - based surveys will be particularly effective here . for instance , the planned space mission euclid @xcite is planning to obtain high - resolution imaging data for the entire southern extragalactic sky , which will be enormously useful for locating many lensed quasars from morphology .",
    "once these quasar lens candidates have been identified , follow - up images can be taken to assess the variability of the candidates and to improve the efficiency of lens finding .",
    "again , we will need additional monitoring data in order to measure time delays .",
    "monitoring follow - up of lenses found in static surveys will , however , represent a significant observational undertaking .      even for well - cadenced surveys such as lsst",
    ", we can conduct follow - up monitoring to obtain more accurate time delays . in some cases the survey duration will not be enough to measure long time delays , and for these systems additional monitoring after the survey will be necessary .",
    "particular attention should be paid to the follow - up of strongly lensed sne because of their transient nature .",
    "clearly it is important to identify lensed sne as early as possible . in principle",
    "it will be possible to trigger follow - up monitoring by the appearance of the first lensed sn image , by checking the difference of photometric redshifts between the sn and its nearby galaxies , or from prior knowledge of the lensed host galaxies .",
    "note that good image position and colour information for sn classification and redshift estimation will be required for this to work . where these are not available",
    ", confirmation of a lensed sn will likely require the appearance of the second image in a lensing configuration .    in our fisher matrix analysis",
    ", we assumed that all the redshifts are known .",
    "spectroscopic redshifts for lensed quasars are relatively easy to obtain , thanks to prominent quasar emission lines .",
    "however , we can expect spectroscopy of the lensed sne and the lensing galaxies to be generally much more difficult , because one has to detect absorption lines to measure the redshifts .",
    "instead , we can adopt photometric redshifts , provided we can cleanly separate the lensed images from the lens galaxy light ; if there is no bias inherited in the photometric redshift measurement , its effect is just to degrade the cosmological constraints from the time delays slightly ( see * ? ? ?",
    "spectroscopic follow - up observations are also helpful for the confirmation of strong lens systems , although the detection of time delays between the images does itself serve as a strong test of the lensing hypothesis .",
    "one of our main findings (  [ sec : surveys ] ) is that accurate prior knowledge on lens potentials is crucial for cosmological constraints from time delays . among others ,",
    "the most important parameter is the mean slope of the effective radial density profile of the lensing galaxy , @xmath209 , including the effect of external convergence .",
    "our requirement of @xmath240 for the lsst time delay sample to be a useful addition to the cosmographic toolbox is in fact not far from the current statistical error of @xmath241 from the sloan lens acs survey @xcite .",
    "care will need to be taken to ensure that the lsst lens galaxy sample is similarly well characterised .",
    "in addition , we expect that the external convergence may be well modelled by combining photometric information for the surrounding field with ray - tracing in @xmath30-body simulations @xcite .    with such a large number of strong lens systems",
    ", it may be possible to determine cosmological parameters and the mean radial density slope simultaneously .",
    "for instance , @xcite constrained the mean radial density profile by combining the einstein radius measurements for lenses with different source redshifts .",
    "moreover , we may also be able to use flux ratios between images to constrain the radial profile ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although we will need to take into account the effects of dark halo substructures , differential dust extinction , and microlensing very carefully .",
    "we leave the exploration of these possibilities to future work .",
    "while we considered a statistical analysis for combining many time delay measurements , tight cosmological constraints may also be obtained from the detailed modelling of individual lens systems ( the so - called `` golden lens '' approach ) .",
    "indeed , the feasibility of this has been nicely demonstrated , by e.g. @xcite for b1608@xmath6656 and @xcite for q0957@xmath6561 .",
    "one advantage of our statistical approach is that it can handle various perturbations on lens potentials , such as substructures and higher - order external perturbations , more straightforwardly , since their effects average out when combining many lenses .",
    "although the average does not always converge to zero ( an example is external convergence ) , this poses no problems as long as the residual can be predicted reasonably accurately by theory .",
    "indeed , the statistical framework provides a means , in principle , to infer the statistical properties of lens substructure , microlensing and dust simultaneously with the cosmology and lens profile parameters .    for individual modelling we do not need to know the mean radial density profile very accurately , but",
    "instead need enough observational constraints to determine the radial profiles of each individual lensing galaxy .",
    "for this reason , we expect the quad lenses to be the focus of the individual modelling efforts , complenting the preference for doubles in the statistical approach . to summarise , we expect that individual mass modelling will provide important complementary constraints on cosmological parameters , and help to assess the systematic errors that each methods involves .",
    "future surveys will discover not only galaxy - scale lenses but also wide - separation lenses produced by massive groups or clusters of galaxies , such as those discovered in the sdss @xcite .",
    "the time variability information will also be helpful in identifying these lenses as well , but the time delays between images will tend to be long , @xmath242  years for massive clusters , suggesting that well - designed follow - up monitoring program may be necessary to measure their time delays .",
    "we have presented detailed calculations of the likely yields of several planned cadenced surveys , adopting realistic distributions for the lens and source properties , and taking account of the selection functions , including the magnification bias .",
    "we find that , for example , the lsst will discover @xmath243 lensed quasars ( @xmath244 of which will have time delay measurements ) and @xmath9 lensed sne . approximately one third of lensed sne will be type - ia . the lenses are dominated by double ( two - image ) lenses , with expected quad fractions of @xmath245% for lensed quasars and @xmath246% for lensed sne .",
    "we have also produced mock catalogues of lenses , which are useful for probing strong lensing selection effects and the feasibility of various science projects .",
    "we have used a mock catalogue of @xmath247 well - observed double lenses in lsst to derive expected cosmological constraints . specifically , we derived precisions on the hubble constant and the dark energy equation of state parameters from this sample of time delay measurements , assuming priors from planck .",
    "the resulting predicted marginalised 68% confidence intervals are @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 , implying that time delays can improve constraints from a jdem supernova type - ia sample .",
    "however , this result holds only if we have accurate prior knowledge of the lens population s mean effective density profile : we find that the prior on the mean radial density slope has to be @xmath248 in order for time delays from the lsst strong lens to be a useful future cosmological probe .",

    "<S> we compute the quad fraction in each survey , predicting it to be @xmath1 for the lensed quasars and @xmath2 for the lensed supernovae . generating a mock catalogue of around 1500 well - observed double - image lenses , as could be derived from the lsst survey </S>",

    "<S> while this is encouraging in the sense that these uncertainties are only 50% larger than those predicted for a space - based type - ia supernova sample , we show how the dark energy figure of merit degrades with decreasing knowledge of the the lens mass distribution .    </S>",
