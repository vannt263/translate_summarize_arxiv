    "the large hadron collider ( lhc ) has confirmed the existence of a higgs boson  @xcite compatible with the one predicted by the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the higgs couplings to fermions and gauge bosons are well within the expected sm couplings .",
    "in addition , no extra scalar particles were found , leaving us with a theory that , at the present scale , is indeed very close to the sm .",
    "all extensions of the sm are therefore being pushed to some kind of sm limit .",
    "such is the case of the simplest extensions of the scalar sector like the ones obtained by simply adding a complex singlet or a complex doublet to the sm field content , the latter designated by the two - higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) .    in a previous work  @xcite",
    "we have discussed the interesting possibility of a sign change in one of the higgs yukawa couplings .",
    "there , we have defined the wrong sign scenario to be such that a sign change occurs in one of the yukawa couplings relative to the higgs coupling to @xmath3 ( @xmath4 or @xmath5 ) .",
    "the lhc data analysed so far does not allow to differentiate between scenarios where a sign change in one of the yukawa couplings occurs ( see e.g.  refs .",
    "these studies were performed taking into account the measured properties of the sm - like higgs .    in this work",
    "we will discuss all the possible sign changes in the higgs couplings to fermions and to massive gauge bosons .",
    "the various wrong sign scenarios will all have in common the property that they are physically meaningful , that is , each of them can in principle be probed experimentally and distinguished from the limit where the model resembles the sm .",
    "in contrast to the wrong sign scenarios are the cases where all higgs couplings to other sm particles change sign ( while no significant difference occurs in the higgs self - couplings ) .",
    "since we will be interested in probing sign changes through loop induced vertices ( which receive contributions from several couplings to sm particles and can only change if relative sign changes occur ) the latter are not considered .",
    "the study will be performed in the framework of the softly - broken @xmath6 symmetric and cp - conserving 2hdm .",
    "the 2hdm is the simplest model that can provide wrong sign scenarios as defined above , since adding instead a ( simpler ) singlet field implies that the shift of the higgs couplings to the other sm particles is the same for all such couplings .",
    "the 2hdm contains a decoupling limit and an alignment limit . in the exact decoupling limit",
    "@xcite the theory is the sm while in the alignment limit the sm - like higgs boson couplings to the sm particles are exactly the sm ones .",
    "however , the coupling structure of the 2hdm further allows for a change in the sign of the tree - level couplings to fermions and to massive gauge bosons .",
    "this sign change can affect both the @xmath7 and the @xmath8 effective couplings which are one - loop generated .",
    "we will examine two different wrong sign scenarios each associated with one of the two cp - even states of the 2hdm ( @xmath9 or @xmath10 ) being identified with the scalar state that has already been found at the lhc ( by convention @xmath11 ) . in both cases there is an associated alignment limit where the tree - level higgs couplings to the sm particles are equal to the sm ones .",
    "furthermore , each scenario also contains wrong sign limits , some of which are still compatible with current data .",
    "we will discuss in detail all the wrong sign scenarios - the ones that are already excluded or highly disfavoured , and those that can be probed at the upcoming runs of the lhc and at a future international linear collider ( ilc ) .",
    "finally we will discuss a very interesting feature of the scenario where the heavy cp - even scalar is identified with the sm higgs .",
    "in fact , because there are two light states the theory does not decouple .",
    "this non - decoupling nature of the heavy scenario will be discussed with the presentation of a situation where , although in the alignment limit , a given scenario could be excluded with a precise measurement of the signal rate @xmath12 .",
    "we will adopt a twofold approach in our analysis . on one hand , we present the currently allowed parameter space regarding the wrong sign scenarios using all experimental data analysed so far . on the other hand , in order to make predictions related to a future increase in the precision of the measured rates , we will analyse the consequences of forcing such rates to be within 20 , 10 or 5% of the sm prediction . in doing this",
    "we will not separate the lhc production mechanisms ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 , vector boson fusion ( vbf ) , @xmath15 associated production and @xmath16 associated production ) ; that is , we sum over all production mechanisms in computing the cross section .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : model ] , we describe the 2hdm and the constraints imposed by theoretical and phenomenological considerations including the most recent lhc data . in section  [ sec : ws ] we discuss the possible wrong sign limits for the 2hdm . in particular we will discuss the case where the heaviest cp - even scalar is the sm higgs boson . in section [ sec : res ] we analyse in detail the different wrong sign scenarios in view of present and future lhc data . in section",
    "[ sec : non - dec ] we discuss the non - decoupling nature of the heavy higgs scenario . finally in section",
    "[ sec : sym ] we define and discuss the _ symmetric limit _ of 2hdms .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section[sec : conc ] .",
    "the two - higgs double model ( 2hdm ) is an extension of the sm where an extra complex scalar doublet is added to the field content of the sm while keeping its gauge symmetry .",
    "it was first proposed by t.d .",
    "lee  @xcite as a means to explain the matter - antimatter asymmetry ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for a detailed description of the model ) . with two doublet fields ( denoted henceforth @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) the most general yukawa lagrangian gives rise to tree - level ( higgs - mediated ) flavour - changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) which are severely constrained by experimental data .",
    "a natural way  @xcite of avoiding fcncs is to impose an extra symmetry on the scalar potential .",
    "we choose to impose a @xmath6 symmetry such that the potential is invariant under @xmath19 , @xmath20 ( i.e the doublets are @xmath6-even and @xmath6-odd respectively ) .",
    "the symmetry is extended to the yukawa sector such that a fermion of a given charge couples only to one doublet .",
    "there are four possible independent coupling choices for the yukawa lagrangian  @xcite . in the literature two of the models",
    "have been named type i and type ii and the other two have been changing names over the years . we shall call them type flipped ( f ) and type lepton specific ( ls ) ( also called y and x  @xcite , respectively ) .",
    "the different yukawa types are built such that : only @xmath18 couples to all fermions ( type i ) ; or @xmath18 couples to up - type quarks and @xmath17 couples to down - type quarks and leptons ( type ii ) ; or @xmath18 couples to up - type quarks and to leptons and @xmath17 couples to down - type quarks ( type f ) ; or finally @xmath18 couples to all quarks and @xmath17 couples to leptons ( type ls ) .",
    "the scalar potential in a softly broken @xmath6 symmetric 2hdm can be written as @xmath21 ~ , \\label{higgspot}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 , @xmath23 are complex su(2 ) doublets .",
    "we choose all parameters and the vacuum expectations values to be real .",
    "this leads to an 8-parameter cp - conserving potential and we take as free parameters the four masses , the rotation angle in the cp - even sector , @xmath24 , the ratio of the vacuum expectation values , @xmath25 , and the soft breaking parameter @xmath26 . without loss of generality , we choose the conventions @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "it is also instructive for our study to re - call how the two physical cp - even eigenstates , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , relate to the original field fluctuations ( before diagonalisation ) which determine the coupling to other sm particles .",
    "if we denote them by @xmath29 ( for each @xmath22 respectively ) , then in our convention @xmath30 now we can find a map between the couplings of the ( already observed ) higgs in the scenario where it is @xmath9 ( the lightest cp - even state ) , to the case where it is instead @xmath10 ( the heaviest cp - even state ) .",
    "due to our convention for the range of @xmath24 one has to be careful .",
    "one can check that the correct map ( which also preserves our convention ) is @xmath31 thus all expressions later obtained in the discussion of the wrong sign scenario can be transposed from the case where @xmath9 is the observed higgs boson to the case where it is @xmath10 by using this map .",
    ".   will later explain some sign flips in our results .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear that the experimental constraints have different effects on the allowed parameter space for each scenario ( light or heavy ) , because the various limits on new ( yet to observe ) scalars are not uniform in mass ( thus the allowed parameter space of one scenario _ can not _ be obtained by applying this map to the data points allowed in the other scenario ) .      the constraints to impose on the cp - conserving 2hdm models originate from two sources ( for a recent review see  ref .",
    "@xcite ) : i ) consistency with theoretical principles / conditions and ii ) consistency with experimental data . regarding the theoretical constraints it is well known , at tree level , that once a cp - conserving minimum of the potential is chosen , no additional minima that spontaneously break the electric charge and/or cp symmetry exist  @xcite .",
    "furthermore we demand that the cp - conserving minimum is the global one  @xcite , that the potential is bounded from below  @xcite and that tree - level unitarity  @xcite is obeyed .    regarding the consistency with experimental data we impose various conditions .",
    "we require the model to satisfy electroweak precision constraints  @xcite , i.e. that the @xmath32 variables  @xcite predicted by the model are within the @xmath33 ellipsoid centred on the best fit point to the electroweak data .",
    "there are also indirect constrains originating from loop processes that involve charged higgs bosons , which depend on @xmath34 through the charged higgs coupling to fermions .",
    "they originate mainly from @xmath35 physics observables  @xcite and from the @xmath36  @xcite measurement .",
    "they give rise to the best bound on the charged higgs mass in a type ii model which yields @xmath37 gev almost independently of @xmath1 .",
    "lep searches based on @xmath38  @xcite and recent lhc results  @xcite based on @xmath39 constrain the mass of the charged higgs to be above @xmath40 gev , depending on the model type .",
    "finally , we should note that there is a 3.4  @xmath0 discrepancy between the value of @xmath41 measured by the bb collaboration  @xcite and the corresponding sm prediction .",
    "if confirmed , this observation would exclude both the sm and the versions of the 2hdm considered in this work .",
    "so far we have described mostly pre - lhc bounds .",
    "the parameter space of the 2hdm is already very constrained by the lhc results  @xcite .",
    "we will now briefly re - analyse these results to find the parameter space still allowed after the 8  tev run .",
    "we have used the  scanners  @xcite program interfaced with sushi  @xcite for the @xmath42 production process at nnlo and hdecay  @xcite for all 2hdm decays .",
    "the numbers were cross - checked with higlu  @xcite and 2hdmc  @xcite .",
    "the remaining higgs production cross sections , vbf , associated production ( with a @xmath5 or @xmath43 ) and @xmath44 were taken from  @xcite at nlo .",
    "sm electroweak corrections were not considered in any production process because the 2hdm electroweak corrections can be significantly different .",
    "all @xmath33 c.l .",
    "exclusion limits , obtained experimentally from the non - observation of new scalars in experimental searches at colliders , were applied using higgsbounds  @xcite .",
    "consistency with the observed signals of the higgs boson at the lhc was tested with  higgssignals  @xcite , which computes a probability for the model point to fit all known signal data , @xmath45 or @xmath46 probability , for example . ] .",
    "the theoretical constraints associated with vacuum stability and tree level unitarity are inbuilt in the  scanners code for any model , whereas specific functions were developed for the 2hdm to test electroweak precision observables and b - physics observables ( all constrained to be within @xmath33 of the best fit values as discussed above ) .    we will use the standard definition of signal strength @xmath47 where @xmath0 is the higgs production cross section and @xmath48 is the branching ratio of the decay into some given final state @xmath49 ; @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the expected values for the same quantities in the sm . in the following sections we will also make predictions for the next lhc run at 13 tev . in these predictions we will not use the present lhc data ( but will use all other constraints ) but",
    "instead we will ask that the rates @xmath52 for the final states @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 to be within @xmath57 , @xmath58 or @xmath59 % of the sm predictions .",
    "we also define @xmath60 which at tree - level is just the ratio of the couplings @xmath61 . taking the @xmath62 coupling as an example , we write @xmath63 and the last equality only holds for leading order ( lo ) widths . obviously , because the decays @xmath64 and @xmath65 are one - loop processes at lo , @xmath66 or @xmath67 can only be calculated by the ratio of the 2hdm width to the respective sm width . unless otherwise stated , the theoretical values of @xmath68 ( where @xmath69 is a fermion ) and @xmath70 ( where @xmath71 is a massive vector boson ) refer to lo widths .",
    "note that while @xmath68 and @xmath70 can be either positive or negative , @xmath66 and @xmath67 are strictly positive .",
    "these definitions for the couplings @xmath72 coincide with the definitions used by the experimental groups at the lhc  @xcite , at leading order .",
    "we shall also make the simplifying assumption ( which holds in the sm and in the 2hdm under consideration ) that all down - type [ up - type ] fermion final states are governed by the same @xmath73 [ @xmath74 .      in this section",
    "we discuss some important features of the allowed parameter space of the models , after imposing all theoretical and experimental constraints mentioned above .",
    "unless stated otherwise , we have set one of the cp - even eigenstates to a mass of 125.9  gev and left all other masses free to run over an interval .",
    "we will refer to the case where @xmath75  gev as the light higgs scenario , and to the case where @xmath76  gev as the heavy higgs scenario .",
    "for all scans , before applying the constraints , we allow @xmath77 , @xmath78 and in practice . ]",
    "all ( eigenstate ) masses are free in the range [ 50,1000 ]  gev , but we have also imposed that the masses of the other neutral scalars are away from the higgs mass @xmath80  gev by more than 5  gev .",
    "these conditions apply to all scans .",
    "any other extra condition ( such as lower or upper bounds imposed on masses ) will be specified for each scan .",
    "+    let us start by discussing the light higgs scenario where @xmath75  gev . in figure",
    "[ fig : lhc8_1 ] we present the allowed parameter space projected on the @xmath34 _ vs _ @xmath81 plane with all constraints applied .",
    "we have also imposed that the cp - odd scalar mass obeys @xmath82 .",
    "we have accepted points that explain the observed higgs signals with a fit probability within @xmath83 , and also represent on top of these the points that survive at @xmath45 and @xmath46 . for the top left and middle panels ( types ii and f ) , the allowed parameter space is centred around two lines .",
    "one is @xmath84 , the alignment limit where all higgs couplings to fermions and massive gauge bosons are exactly the sm ones .",
    "the other one is @xmath85 which we have called the _ _ wrong sign limit__. ] in  @xcite , to be discussed in detail in the next section .",
    "the two plots are very similar , both in the allowed range for @xmath86 and in that large values of @xmath1 are excluded except for @xmath86 very close to @xmath2 . in order to understand the shape of the curves let us consider the approximation where the production occurs only via @xmath87 while the the total width is dominated by @xmath88 .",
    "as shown in  @xcite , this approximation can be written @xmath89 and by imposing @xmath90 one reproduces figure  [ fig : lhc8_1 ] for types ii and f with remarkable accuracy , as shown in  @xcite .",
    "hence , the bounds on @xmath91 alone , can explain not only the shape but also the numerical values presented in the plots in figure  [ fig : lhc8_1 ] for types ii and f. furthermore , the b - loop contribution in @xmath92 and @xmath93 grows with @xmath94 which is exactly @xmath95 when @xmath96 but even for , say @xmath97 , taking @xmath98 we get an enhancement factor of @xmath99 relative to the respective sm contribution . as @xmath100 approaches @xmath2 ,",
    "the 2hdm lightest higgs branching ratios ( brs ) to sm particles do not differ much from the values of the respective sm higgs decays .",
    "therefore , the inclusion of the b - loops would just confirm the exclusion of the high @xmath1 region except close to the alignment limit .    in the top right and bottom panels of figure  [ fig : lhc8_1 ]",
    "we show the allowed parameter space for type ls and type i. let us focus first on the top right and bottom left panels ( for which no extra cut is present ) .",
    "we start by observing that there is no @xmath1 enhancement in the higgs production cross section .",
    "in fact , the higgs couplings to both up - type and down - type quarks are the same and the sm cross section for @xmath101 is just multiplied by the factor @xmath102 that could only be large for @xmath103 , which is forbidden by b - physics constraints . for type",
    "i , considering the limit where the production occurs only via @xmath87 while the total width is dominated by @xmath88 ( similarly to type ii and f ) , we obtain @xmath104 we conclude that the result for type i is a bound on @xmath100 which is almost independent of @xmath1 . in fact , except for the higgs self - couplings , the type i 2hdm is similar to the model obtained by adding a singlet to the sm , because if @xmath105 ( using equation [ hddhuuils ] ) @xmath106 hence , only constraints related to the shape of the potential ( such as the ones arising from vacuum stability and perturbative unitarity ) can introduce some @xmath34 dependence .    in the case of type ls , a similar approximation needs to take into account both @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "in fact , if we take say @xmath109 the two widths are equal for @xmath110 .",
    "the value of @xmath1 for which the widths cross grows with @xmath86 and above the crossing value @xmath111 dominates .",
    "therefore , depending on the values of @xmath86 and @xmath1 we either have an approximate expression for @xmath91 that is closer to type ii ( when @xmath111 dominates - equation  ) or to type i ( when @xmath88 dominates - equation  ) .",
    "we can also write an approximate expression for @xmath91 by considering as dominant the sum of the two widths @xmath112 , @xmath113 finally , also the measurement of @xmath114 affects considerably more the parameter space of type ls than that of type i  @xcite .",
    "as this decay becomes more important with growing @xmath1 the exclusion region increases in the large @xmath1 region .    in the bottom panels for type i , we also present ( middle and right ) the effect of placing a cut on the heavy higgs mass , @xmath115 .",
    "it is quite remarkable the effect that this cut ( combined with the constraints ) has on the allowed parameter space for type i ( which is otherwise almost independent of @xmath1 ) .",
    "this behaviour is mainly related to the theoretical constraints imposed on the 2hdm including the discriminant that forces the model to be in the global minimum  @xcite at tree - level . to see the effect of the latter we show in figure  [ fig : lhc8_global ] : in black , points for which the global minimum conditions was lifted ; in red , the subset of the black points that survive the mass cut @xmath116  gev at @xmath83 ; and in yellow , the subset which survives the mass cut and the global minimum condition .",
    "one should note that the global minimum condition does not play in general a major role in constraining the parameter space .",
    "indeed this condition does not change the allowed regions for the other models , once the lhc constraints are imposed . moreover , as discussed in  @xcite , the theory can still be viable in a local minimum provided that the tunnelling time to the global one is larger than the age of the universe .",
    "the second scenario we consider is the heavy higgs scenario of figure  [ fig : lhc8_2 ] , where @xmath117 . in this case",
    "we have also imposed the lightest cp - even scalar mass , @xmath118 to be varied in the range @xmath119 to @xmath120 .",
    "this somewhat short range for @xmath118 was chosen mainly because we want to disallow the decay @xmath121 .",
    "if allowed it would be the main decay channel and the model would have to be very fine - tuned ( taking @xmath122 )  @xcite for @xmath10 to still be the sm - like higgs found at the lhc .",
    "this is justified because our main goal is to compare the alignment limit with the different wrong sign scenarios for the heavy higgs case ( to be discussed in detail in the next sections ) .",
    "one should stress that all collider bounds were taken into account , including the lep bound on a light scalar coming from @xmath123 .",
    "it is straightforward to show ( using the map of eq .  )",
    "that all arguments that were used above to explain the excluded ( large ) @xmath34 regions in the light scenario still hold with the replacements @xmath124 in eqs .   and  .",
    "this also explains why the two bands that are still allowed for each model type , now appear separated , on the left ( @xmath125 ) and on the right ( @xmath126 ) respectively .",
    "similarly the line equivalent to the @xmath127 line was mapped to @xmath128 ( now with @xmath129 ) ( left band of each plot in figure  [ fig : lhc8_2 ] ) . after discussing in detail all the possible wrong sign scenarios we will return to the discussion of figure  [ fig : lhc8_2 ] in sect .",
    "[ subsec : heavy ] .",
    "in this section we will classify the possible sign changes that can occur ( for each scenario ) in the higgs couplings to fermions and massive gauge bosons , relative to the corresponding sm higgs couplings .",
    "we start by discussing the scenario where @xmath130 gev . as discussed in the previous section , in this scenario , models ii and f have two disjunct allowed regions .",
    "one corresponding to the alignment limit and the other one centred around the line @xmath131 . with our conventions ,",
    "the latter corresponds to the situation where the higgs coupling to down - type quarks changes sign relative to the sm , while couplings to up - type quarks and massive gauge bosons are the sm ones .",
    "this is the wrong sign limit  @xcite ( see also  @xcite for the cp - conserving 2hdm and @xcite for the complex 2hdm ) and it is imposed only at tree - level . the wrong sign scenarios were first studied in the context of the 2hdm in  @xcite .",
    "we will now analyse the limit @xmath85 for all yukawa types .",
    "the main goal is to understand if a sign change in a given higgs coupling can be measured at the lhc , being therefore distinguishable from the alignment limit .",
    "the yukawa coupling signs for the different model types , when @xmath85 , are shown in table  [ tab : couplings ] .    .lightest higgs yukawa couplings in models i , ii , f and ls in the limit @xmath127 .",
    "[ tab : couplings ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the yukawa couplings have all changed sign relative to lightest higgs scenario .",
    "it is clear that it is again type ii and type f that can be distinguished from the corresponding alignment limit in @xmath67 .",
    "it should be noted , however , that in each of the corresponding wrong sign scenarios ( heavy higgs scenario and last section s light higgs scenario ) the value of @xmath67 is exactly the same .    as for the higgs coupling to massive gauge bosons , when @xmath132 , it is given by @xmath133 again we have two distinct regimes regarding the sign of @xmath134 : when @xmath135 , @xmath136 while if @xmath137 , @xmath138 .",
    "therefore , also the sign of @xmath134 is reversed relative to that of @xmath70 . as will be discussed later in detail , the case @xmath139 is already excluded and it will not be further mentioned . finally , the charged higgs coupling for @xmath140 is @xmath141 while in the heavy higgs alignment limit we obtain @xmath142 where @xmath143 .",
    "therefore , there is a simultaneous change of sign in the higgs couplings to massive gauge bosons and in the yukawa couplings relative to the lightest higgs case .",
    "that is , the wrong sign scenarios are exactly the same as the ones for the lightest higgs case .",
    "this is true even for the charged higgs coupling to the heavy higgs .",

    "we have forced all rates to be within @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath154 of the sm predictions . we have concluded that measurements of either @xmath67 and @xmath66 with @xmath154 accuracy would enable us to distinguish between the alignment limit and the wrong sign scenario . in this section",
    "we show the status of @xmath67 and @xmath66 at the end of the 8 tev run .    in the left panel of figure  [ fig : f01 ]",

    "it is clear that , at the end of the 8 tev run , the wrong sign scenario is still allowed at 1@xmath0 .",
    "this was expected because , as discussed in  @xcite , we need the 13/14 tev lhc with at least an integrated luminosity of 300 @xmath155 to exclude this particular wrong sign scenario . finally , although not exactly the same , the plots for type f look very similar , and there is no point in showing them here . as discussed in  @xcite there is no wrong sign scenario in types i and ls for @xmath135 .",

    "the main purpose is to show that the values that give rise to the allowed 2@xmath0 points require a large @xmath175 close to the unitarity limit .",
    "this is a consequence of the structure of the vertex @xmath180 which gauges the new physics contributions in loop processes where the @xmath43-loop is replaced by a charged higgs loop .",

    "as previously discussed , because @xmath164 is positive in our convention , we have @xmath181 and , as seen in the left panel of figure  [ fig : f4 ] , its value is well below @xmath2 meaning that it is therefore very hard to satisfy the lhc bounds on @xmath91 .",

    "contrary to type i and type ls , where @xmath182 forces @xmath135 , in type ii ( and type f ) values slightly below @xmath183 are still allowed for large charged higgs masses .",
    "the main b - physics observables that provide an exclusion of the small @xmath34 region are @xmath156 , that was included as a filter at @xmath184 in figure  [ fig : f4 ] , and the @xmath35@xmath179 mixing data , that was not included .",
    "the constraint from @xmath35@xmath179 mixing is derived from the measurement of @xmath185 and @xmath186  @xcite . in the sm",
    ", neutral - meson mixing occurs due to a box diagram with @xmath43-boson exchange . in the 2hdm",
    "the box contains new contributions due to the charged higgs bosons , which are obtained by replacing one or two @xmath43-boson lines by charged higgs lines ( expressions for such contributions at leading - order can be found in  @xcite ) .",
    "the presence of the new diagrams implies that , in the 2hdm , the ckm matrix parameters should be determined from the data simultaneously with the 2hdm parameters in the diagrams ( i.e. the charged higgs mass @xmath175 and @xmath1 ) .",
    "this modifies the sm fit to fix the ckm matrix  @xcite .",
    "when performing this simultaneous fit , the constraints on the @xmath187 plane become less restrictive as shown in  @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : f5 ]  @xcite we present the exclusion lines obtained from @xmath156 and from the @xmath35@xmath179 mixing data at 95 @xmath188 c.l . , on the @xmath189 plane .",

    "hence , the b - physics constraints exclude this particular wrong sign scenario at 95 @xmath188 c.l .. however , it is clear that even without the constraints coming from loop processes , this scenario will be definitely excluded by the data obtained during the next run of the lhc , assuming that all measurements converge to the sm values with higher precision .",
    "we now return to the discussion of the wrong sign cases for the heavy higgs scenario , focusing on @xmath190 .",
    "the case where the heaviest cp - even higgs is the scalar state that was observed at the lhc was first analysed in  @xcite , in the context of the 2hdm and it was discussed after the lhc 8 tev run in  @xcite .    as previously discussed , the type of wrong sign limits are exactly the same in the light and in the heavy higgs scenario .",
    "therefore , the only possible difference between the two scenarios could only come from fact that the parameter spaces scanned are not exactly the same .",
    "in fact , in the heavy scenario there is a cp - even scalar with a mass below 125 gev which alters the conditions of the scan .",
    "however , the general trend is the same and in figure  [ fig : f11 ] we present @xmath66 , for the heavy higgs scenario , as a function of @xmath73 and also as a function of @xmath191 with all points that have passed both the pre - lhc constraints and the 7 and 8 tev lhc higgs data at 1@xmath0 ( blue ) , 2@xmath0 ( red ) and 3@xmath0 ( green ) , for the type ii model ( left ) and type f model ( right ) .",
    "qualitatively , there seems to be no major differences when we compare these results with the ones obtained for the light higgs case . in the next section",
    ", while discussing the non - decoupling nature of this scenario we will see that even the conclusions regarding the exclusion of the wrong sign scenario with a @xmath149 precision measurement of the rates also apply to the heavy higgs case .",
    "moreover , the reason for this exclusion is exactly the same in the two scenarios - a decrease in @xmath192 due to the charged higgs loop contribution in the wrong sign limit .",
    "in this section we investigate what a measurement of the rates within @xmath59 , @xmath58 and @xmath193 of the sm value could tell us about the heavy higgs scenario .",
    "we start with type ii ( the results for type f are very similar ) and our first goal is to understand if the light higgs and heavy higgs scenarios could be distinguished at the lhc . from now on we drop the superscript @xmath10 in @xmath194 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : f10 ] we show the predicted allowed space for type ii with all rates within @xmath59 , @xmath58 and @xmath193 of the sm values . in the left panel",
    "we present the light higgs scenario while in the right panel one can see the heavy higgs case . because the loop integrals are exactly the same in the two wrong sign limits ( heavy and light ) , the values of @xmath67 are both centred at @xmath195 @xmath196 .",
    "the main difference between the two scenarios is the shape of the allowed regions which is mainly due to the reduced size of the parameter space in the case of heavy higgs which implies smaller allowed regions .",
    "hence , @xmath67 can be used to distinguish between wrong and alignment scenarios but not between the heavy and light cases .",
    "the same conclusion can be drawn from figure  [ fig : f12 ] where we compare @xmath66 in the two wrong sign scenarios .",
    "on the left we show the light higgs case and on the right the heavy higgs scenario .",
    "clearly we see that a @xmath149 precision would allow us to distinguish wrong sign from alignment scenarios both in the heavy and in the light higgs case but not the two different wrong sign scenarios from each other .",
    "we recall once again that it is the reduction of the width @xmath192 , which is due to the charged higgs boson loop contribution , that ultimately decreases @xmath12 below @xmath197 .    however , both figures  [ fig : f10 ] and  [ fig : f12 ] reveal a much more interesting feature of the heavy higgs scenario",
    ". in fact the alignment limit of the heavy higgs can be excluded with a measurement of the rates at @xmath149 .",
    "clearly this would not be possible for the light higgs scenario due to the decoupling limit of the 2hdm  @xcite .",
    "we now show that it is again the charged higgs loop together with the theoretical and experimental constraints that is responsible for a reduction in @xmath12 below @xmath197 .",
    "we start by recalling that the couplings of the heavy higgs to the charged higgs bosons can be written in the form ( for @xmath135 ) @xmath198 for the wrong sign and alignment limit respectively .",
    "now , what leads to the reduction of @xmath192 in the wrong sign case is the almost constant negative value of @xmath199 .",
    "if we compare the two expressions in  , the difference is that the term @xmath200 is replaced by @xmath201 .",
    "hence , in order to show that a similar situation occurs in the alignment case , we have to prove that @xmath202 is of the order of @xmath115 and therefore small when compared to the charged higgs mass .",
    "this is indeed the case - when forcing the potential to be bounded from below , the condition @xmath203 , which in the alignment limit can be rewritten in the form @xmath204 clearly shows that @xmath115 is indeed of the order of @xmath202 and @xmath205 because , as discussed before , @xmath206 gev .",
    "however , one should note that when removing the global minimum condition @xmath207 could also be negative .",
    "therefore , it is in fact a combination of the theoretical conditions that leads to values of @xmath207 small enough to always keep @xmath12 below @xmath197 , even for @xmath208 . had we removed all theoretical conditions , points with @xmath12 above @xmath197 would be allowed .",
    "in the left panel of figure  [ fig : f122 ] we present the rates @xmath209 and @xmath12 as a function of @xmath1 in the alignment limit for the heavy scenario with @xmath91 measured at @xmath210 .",
    "the decrease in @xmath12 is clearly seen and explained by the plot on the right where @xmath211 as a function of the charged higgs mass is shown .",
    "as previously discussed this coupling is always negative and almost constant which leads to a decrease in the higgs to two photons width .",
    "this result for the heavy scenario in the alignment limit is extremely interesting as it clearly shows the non - decoupling nature of the heavy scenario . in the next section",
    "we discuss the type i model that has no wrong sign limit for @xmath135 .",
    "in figure  [ fig : lhc8_2 ] we saw that in the heavy scenario there is a region analogous to the @xmath127 region of the light higgs scenario .",
    "such region is now centred on the line @xmath212 . however , regardless of the scenario we are considering , the limits @xmath127 ( light case ) and @xmath128 ( heavy case ) , are not _ a priori _ wrong sign scenarios .",
    "that is , if we consider the type i 2hdm , none of the higgs couplings to the remaining sm particles changes sign relative to the sm one ( modulo a global sign change in the heavy scenario ) .",
    "nevertheless , the shift @xmath213 still changes the value of @xmath70 , which as previously seen is given by @xmath214 and we recall that in the heavy scenario there is a global minus sign change in the higgs coupling when @xmath212 .",
    "we call this limit _ symmetric limit _ to distinguish it from the wrong sign limit because there is no sign change in the couplings even though the shift @xmath213 occurs .    for the case of type ls",
    "the only coupling that changes sign relative to the sm is @xmath215 which plays no role in the discussion given the predicted accuracy of future rate measurements at the lhc . for the remainder of this section we will focus on the heavy case ( the discussion for the light case is similar ) .",
    "since we are taking @xmath135 , it is true for all @xmath216 that @xmath217 ( @xmath218 represent either a fermion or a massive gauge boson ) .",
    "hence , for type i , and @xmath135 not only there are no sign changes but we recover exactly the alignment limit when @xmath219 .    in figure  [",
    "fig : f13 ] we show the predicted allowed parameter space with all rates measured at @xmath59 ( red ) , @xmath58 ( blue ) and @xmath193 ( black ) where the regions centred around @xmath2 correspond to the alignment limit and the ones around @xmath220 correspond to the _ symmetric limit_. type i is shown on the left panel while type ls is in the right panel .",
    "there are two points worth discussing .",
    "first it is clear that , as the precision increases , the lower bound on @xmath1 grows from about @xmath221 at @xmath193 , to @xmath144 at @xmath222 and finally to @xmath223 at @xmath149 . in type i",
    "this behaviour is also present but it is not so striking .",
    "the second point is that even for the alignment limit there seems to appear again some kind of non - decoupling effect that excludes the low @xmath1 region .",
    "( blue ) and @xmath149 ( red ) .",
    "left : alignment limit ; right : _ symmetric _ limit.,title=\"fig : \" ]   ( blue ) and @xmath149 ( red ) . left : alignment limit ; right : _ symmetric _ limit.,title=\"fig : \" ]    let us start with the first point .",
    "the _ symmetric limit _ is clearly seen in type ls for low @xmath1 .",
    "now one may ask if the _ symmetric limit _ could be distinguished from the alignment limit , for finite @xmath1 , given enough precision in type i. in figure  [ fig : f9 ] we show the predicted allowed parameter space with all rates within @xmath222 ( blue ) and @xmath149 ( red ) of the sm predictions for the alignment limit - all points with @xmath224 ( left panel ) and for the _ symmetric limit _ - all points with @xmath225 ( right panel ) . noting that @xmath226 it is going to be extremely hard to distinguish the two limits except for the very low @xmath1 region where they could both be excluded .",
    "in fact , this bring us to the second point . why are values of low @xmath1 excluded in the alignment limit when all rates are measured at @xmath149 ?",
    "the answer again lies in the behaviour of the @xmath10 coupling to the charged higgs bosons together with the remaining theoretical and experimental constraints . in the left panel of figure  [ fig : f131 ] we present @xmath12 as a function of @xmath1 with @xmath91 measured at @xmath210 .",
    "the region where @xmath192 is below @xmath197 is easily identifiable in the plot for the low @xmath1 region . in the right panel",
    "we present the plot @xmath227 as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "the low values of @xmath1 correspond to negative values of the couplings and therefore to a decrease in the two photons width .",
    "as suggested by the shape of this plot , where one sees a sharp line cutting the low @xmath34 region , this is mainly due to a combination of the theoretical constraints imposed on the model .",
    "finally , we stress that @xmath67 is the same in the symmetric and in the alignment limits while @xmath66 shows a negligible difference in the two limits .",
    "we have discussed all the different possibilities for having a wrong sign limit in 2hdms .",
    "a wrong sign limit is defined as a scenario where : ( a ) one or more higgs couplings to sm particles change sign relative to the corresponding sm couplings ; ( b ) this difference has physical meaning , that is , it could in principle be measured experimentally .",
    "hence , each scenario is defined by a condition @xmath228 .",
    "after listing all possible wrong sign scenario cases when the lightest higgs is the alignment one , we have also discussed the case where it is the heaviest cp - even higgs .",
    "we have shown that with all the 7/8 tev data analysed so far , the wrong sign scenarios for both type ii and type f are still allowed even at @xmath46 .",
    "this is true not only for the lightest higgs case but also for the heaviest higgs scenario in the regime @xmath135 .",
    "the light / heavy higgs scenarios are very similar except in the range of the parameter scan and in the non - decoupling nature of the heavy scenario .",
    "although we have concluded that each of the wrong sign scenarios can be distinguished from the respective alignment limit , we have also concluded that it is hard to differentiate between the two wrong sign scenarios ( light or heavy ) .",
    "a possibility not previously discussed was the wrong sign scenarios for the case where @xmath139 which is possible for all yukawa types .",
    "taking into account all constraints except the ones from @xmath35@xmath179 mixing data , we have shown that the lhc does allow this particular wrong sign limit for types ii and f at @xmath45 .",
    "we have also shown that @xmath35@xmath179 mixing data at 95 @xmath188 c.l .",
    "completely excludes this region .",
    "it is however possible that b - physics constraints taken at @xmath83 or @xmath229 would not exclude this scenario . in the end ,",
    "the next lhc run at 13 tev will be able to definitely exclude this region .",
    "we have then discussed the non - decoupling nature of the heavy higgs case .",
    "in fact , we have shown that due to a non - decoupling effect in the charged higgs coupling to the heavy cp - even higgs boson , there is a reduction in @xmath192 in the alignment limit , similarly to what happens for the wrong sign limit .",
    "we conclude that a measurement of @xmath12 with a @xmath210 precision would exclude the alignment limit scenario in the heavy type ii case .",
    "finally , we have also discussed the _ symmetric _ limit in the context of the heavy higgs scenario .",
    "this is a limit that occurs in type i ( also type ls if we disregard @xmath215 which plays no major role in the lhc results ) and corresponds to the flip @xmath230 , and consequently to @xmath231 while @xmath232 .",
    "although @xmath233 when @xmath234 this case could be in principle distinguishable from @xmath220 for finite values of @xmath1 ( we again recall that in this case @xmath220 corresponds to the sm @xmath70 because there is a global sign change in the limit @xmath235 ) .",

    "<S> we analyse the possibility that , in two higgs doublet models , one or more of the higgs couplings to fermions or to gauge bosons change sign , relative to the respective higgs standard model couplings . </S>",
    "<S> possible sign changes in the coupling of a neutral scalar to charged ones are also discussed . </S>",
    "<S> these _ wrong signs _ can have important physical consequences , manifesting themselves in higgs production via gluon fusion or higgs decay into two gluons or into two photons . </S>",
    "<S> we consider all possible wrong sign scenarios , and also the _ symmetric limit _ , in all possible yukawa implementations of the two higgs doublet model , in two different possibilities : the observed higgs boson is the lightest cp - even scalar , or the heaviest one . </S>",
    "<S> we also analyse thoroughly the impact of the currently available lhc data on such scenarios . with all 8 tev data analysed </S>",
    "<S> , all wrong sign scenarios are allowed in all yukawa types , even at the 1@xmath0 level . </S>",
    "<S> however , we will show that b - physics constraints are crucial in excluding the possibility of wrong sign scenarios in the case where @xmath1 is below @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we will also discuss the future prospects for probing the wrong sign scenarios at the next lhc run . </S>",
    "<S> finally we will present a scenario where the alignment limit could be excluded due to non - decoupling in the case where the heavy cp - even higgs is the one discovered at the lhc . </S>"
