    "it is expected that the properties of vector mesons at finite density and/or temperature should be reflected in the dilepton spectrum observed in nuclear reactions .",
    "it has also been suggested that modifications of the vector - meson properties are related to the restoration of chiral symmetry in dense matter  @xcite .",
    "indeed the enhancement of low - mass dileptons found in heavy - ion collisions  @xcite can be interpreted in terms of a non - trivial change of the vector meson spectral density in hot / dense matter .",
    "however , the dilepton spectra observed in heavy - ion collisions involve dileptons from different stages of the collision . consequently collision models have to be invoked to relate the spectra to the vector - meson spectral density at a given temperature and density . at present",

    ", the characteristics of the two approaches still differ and the relation between them remains nebulous . in order to reduce the discrepancies and eventually approach a unified description , it is important to reduce the uncertainties of the theoretical models by constraining the parameters with experimental data  @xcite and results derived directly from qcd .    in this work",
    ", we derive in detail qcd constraints on the three - momentum dependence of the vector meson spectral density in nuclear matter .",

    "in the first stage we derive the operator product expansion ( ope ) and constructs constraints on the spectral density using the borel transformed dispersion relation . in the second stage ,",
    "model calculations are confronted with these constraints .",
    "as we will see , the relevant condensates that appear in the constraints for the dispersion effect are well known up to nuclear matter density and the corresponding qcd sum rule provides a solid reference point for model calculations  @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach is to model the phenomenological side by a simple functional form with a few parameters and obtain medium modifications of these parameters and thus of the spectral density .",

    ", there is a trade - off between a reduction of the mass and an increase of the width .",
    "thus , there is a band of possible combinations of mass and width , where the quality of the fit to the constraint is almost unchanged .",

    "consequently , in many models the @xmath0 n couplings to the nucleon and the @xmath159 , are obtained e.g. from the bonn potential  @xcite .",
    "an important point , which apparently has been overlooked , is that in the bonn potential the coupling constant @xmath165 is multiplied by a form factor  @xcite , @xmath167 where @xmath168gev and @xmath169 for the @xmath170 and @xmath171 for the @xmath4 vertex .",
    "hence , the effective value of the coupling constant at @xmath25 is reduced by 0.7 for the nucleon and by 0.49 for the @xmath159 .",
    "since the self energy is proportional to the square of the coupling constant and the corresponding form factor , the contribution of the nucleon ( @xmath159 ) is reduced by a multiplicative factor of 0.49 ( 0.24 ) .",
    "this reduction of the effective coupling constant has been left out in previous calculations .",
    "the resonances @xmath160 and @xmath161 are situated below the nominal threshold for the decay into a nucleon and a hypothetical zero - width @xmath0 meson .",
    "thus , they can decay into a nucleon and a @xmath0 meson only because of the finite widths of the particles involved .",
    "since in this case only the low - mass tail of the @xmath0 meson is seen in the two - pion spectrum  @xcite , a reliable identification of the @xmath0 is very difficult .",
    "consequently , the determination of the corresponding coupling constants is rather uncertain . in order to explore possible consequences of this uncertainty",
    ", we also show results for the case where the two coupling constants vanish .",
    "let us now confront this set of coupling constants with the qcd sum rules .",
    "for the nucleon and the @xmath159 , we use the couplings of the bonn potential , with the corresponding form factors , extrapolated into the time - like region @xmath172 thus , for @xmath173 we use the covariant generalization of ( [ ff ] ) .",
    "however , close to the pole at @xmath174 this form clearly makes no sense . for @xmath175",
    "we therefore employ the simple form shown in the second line of ( [ fc ] ) , with the exponent @xmath176 or @xmath177 .",
    "fortunately , due to the exponential weighting , the qcd sum rule ( [ ope28 ] ) is insensitive to the precise form of @xmath178 in this range of energies ; the real parts of @xmath108 obtained from the right - hand side of ( [ ope28 ] ) for different values of @xmath179 are almost indistinguishable .",
    "thus , for the nucleon and the @xmath159 we replace the coupling constant @xmath165 in eq .",
    "( [ com7 ] ) by @xmath180 .    for the @xmath163 and the @xmath162 we use the coupling constants @xmath165 determined in ref .",
    "since the corresponding form factors are normalized to unity for zero three - momentum , they do not affect the leading @xmath2 dependence . furthermore",
    ", a possible frequency dependence can also be neglected , because , in contrast to the @xmath159 , these resonances contribute significantly only in the kinematical region where the coupling constants are determined , i.e. , for almost on - shell @xmath0 mesons .",
    "the coupling constants used are given in table iii .",
    "note that here we use the @xmath181 and @xmath182 coupling constants of ref .",
    "@xcite , which differ slightly from those used in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in fig .",
    "4 we show the effect of a consistent treatment of the @xmath4 form factor on the spectral density . as expected , the contribution due to the @xmath159 is substantially reduced .",
    "this reduction is also reflected in an improved agreement with the constraint equation , as shown in fig .",
    "5 . there , the distance between the two solid lines , which correspond to the ope with and without the dimension 6 operators , represent the uncertainty of the left - hand side of ( [ ope28 ] ) . the long - dashed line is the right - hand side without the form factor for the delta and the nucleon , while the dashed line shows the result including form factors of the form eq .",
    "( [ fc ] ) with @xmath183 .",
    "( since , as noted above , the dependence on @xmath179 is minimal , we do not show results for @xmath184 . ) furthermore , the dotted line shows the result of including the form factors but with vanishing couplings to the @xmath160 and @xmath161 resonances .",
    "thus , the range between the dashed and dotted lines indicate the uncertainty due to the poorly known @xmath160 and @xmath161 coupling constants .",
    "using the criteria discussed in sect .",
    "iii , we obtain a borel window , where the constraint equation can be applied , of @xmath185 .",
    "clearly , there is a good agreement between the ope and the phenomenological calculation , when the @xmath4 form factor is consistently taken into account .",
    "we note that most of the disagreement is removed already with a static ( frequency independent ) form factor , i.e. , by renormalizing the effective coupling strength by 0.7 for the nucleon and by 0.49 for the @xmath5 .",
    "the resulting phenomenological side is shown by the dash - dotted line in fig .",
    "5 . however",
    ", the frequency dependence , as parameterized in ( [ fc ] ) , leads to a further improvement ( see fig .  5 ) .",
    "our work indicates that the @xmath186 coupling used in many model calculations is unphysical .",
    "the bonn potential offers no justification for the very strong effective couplings used .",
    "furthermore , such couplings violate the constraints obtained from qcd sum rules .",
    "thus , it is necessary to re - analyze those calculations of the low - mass dilepton spectrum in heavy - ion collisions , where the @xmath4 coupling was treated inconsistently .",
    "we have presented a model independent constraint for the three momentum dependence of the vector meson spectral function in a nuclear medium .",
    "we have shown that the momentum dependence of the spectral density obtained in model calculations  @xcite is too strong to satisfy the constraint derived from qcd sum rules .",
    "the main source of the discrepancy is the large contribution from the @xmath159 . in these models , the coupling of the rho meson to the nucleon and the @xmath159",
    "is not accounted for in a consistent manner .",
    "while the coupling constant is taken e.g. from the bonn potential , the form factor is not ; the normalization of the form factor differs considerably from that , which is used in the bonn potential .",
    "this leads to an effective coupling strength which is approximately a factor two too large .",
    "when the original bonn form factor is employed , the contribution of the @xmath159 is substantially reduced and we find good agreement with the constraint equation .    in view of this it would be important to reexamine the hadronic model calculations that are used to interpret the low - mass dilepton enhancement found in relativistic heavy - ion collisions , taking the form factors properly into account .",
    "the unphysically large coupling to the @xmath159 gives rise to a spurious enhancement of the vector meson spectral density for low invariant masses .",
