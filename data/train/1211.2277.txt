    "very recently , babar collaboration reported the measurement of the baryonic @xmath6 decay @xmath7 and observed a new structure in the @xmath8 invariant mass spectrum at @xmath9 @xcite . for simplicity , one could name the new structure as @xmath0 .",
    "soon after the experimental observation , he",
    "_ et al . _ have suggested that @xmath0 could be a @xmath1 molecular state from an effective lagrangian calculation @xcite . theoretically , the molecular concept is well and truly not a new topic but with a history .",
    "it was put forward nearly 40 years ago in ref .",
    "@xcite and was predicted that molecular states have a rich spectroscopy in ref .",
    "the possible deuteron - like two - meson bound states were studied in ref . @xcite . in recent years , some of  x \" ,  y \" , and ",
    "z \" new hadrons are ranked as possible molecular candidates . such as , @xmath10 could be a @xmath11 molecular state @xcite ; @xmath12 is interpreted as a @xmath13 state @xcite ; @xmath14 is proposed to be a @xmath15 @xcite or an @xmath16 state @xcite ; @xmath17 is deciphered as a @xmath18 state @xcite ; @xmath19 and @xmath20 could be @xmath21 and @xmath22 states , respectively @xcite . especially , there already have a lot of works discussing baryon resonances with meson - baryon molecular structures , e.g. @xcite . if molecular states can be completely confirmed by experiment , qcd will be further testified and then one will understand the qcd low - energy behaviors more deeply .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to study whether the newly observed @xmath0 state could be a @xmath1 molecular state .    in the real world , quarks are confined inside hadrons and the strong interaction dynamics of hadronic systems is governed by nonperturbative qcd effect completely .",
    "many questions concerning dynamics of the quarks and gluons at large distances remain unanswered or understood only at a qualitative level .",
    "it is quite difficult to extract hadronic information quantitatively from the basic theory of qcd .",
    "the qcd sum rule method @xcite is a nonperturbative formulation firmly based on the first principle of qcd , which has been successfully applied to conventional hadronic systems , i.e. mesons or baryons ( for reviews see @xcite and references therein ) . for multiquark states ,",
    "there have appeared fruitful results from qcd sum rules these years ( for a review on multiquark qcd sum rules one can see @xcite and references therein ) . in particular for hadrons containing five quarks , some authors began to study light pentaquark states in refs .",
    "the application of qcd sum rules to heavy pentaquark states was performed in ref .",
    "@xcite for the first time .    in this work ,",
    "we devote to investigating that whether the newly observed resonance @xmath0 could be a @xmath1 molecular state ( @xmath23 has a quark content @xmath24 ) in the framework of qcd sum rules . as a byproduct",
    ", the mass for its bottom counterpart @xmath4 is also predicted on the assumption that it could exist ( @xmath25 has a quark content @xmath26 and one should note that it has not been observed ) . in theory , one could expect that the @xmath25 meson should be assigned the same spin parity @xmath27 as @xmath23 .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as three sections .",
    "we discuss qcd sum rules for molecular states in sec .",

    "are presented in sec .",

    "@xcite , and the one for nucleon @xmath30 has been listed in ref .",
    ". one can construct the @xmath1 or @xmath4 molecular state current from meson - baryon type of fields @xmath31 where @xmath32 is heavy quark @xmath33 or @xmath34 , and @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , as well as @xmath38 denote light quarks .",
    "the index @xmath39 means matrix transposition , @xmath40 is the charge conjugation matrix , with @xmath41 , @xmath34 , @xmath33 and @xmath42 are color indices .",
    "one should note that meson - baryon molecules in the real world are long objects in which the meson and the baryon are far away from each other .",
    "the currents in this work and in most of the qcd sum rule works are local and the five field operators here act at the same space - time point .",
    "it is a limitation inherent in the qcd sum rule disposal of the hadrons since the bound states are not point particles in a rigorous manner .",
    "lorentz covariance implies that the two - point correlation function in eq .",
    "( [ correlator ] ) has the form @xmath43 according to the philosophy of qcd sum rules , the correlator is evaluated in two ways .",
    "phenomenologically , the correlator can be expressed as a dispersion integral over a physical spectral function @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the mass of the hadronic resonance , and @xmath46 gives the coupling of the current to the hadron @xmath47 . in the ope side , short - distance effects",
    "are taken care of by wilson coefficients , while long - distance confinement effects are included as power corrections and parameterized in terms of vacuum expectation values of local operators , the so - called condensates .",
    "one can write the correlation function in the ope side in terms of a dispersion relation @xmath48 where the spectral density is given by the imaginary part of the correlation function @xmath49 technically , one works at leading order in @xmath50 and considers condensates up to dimension @xmath2 . to keep the heavy - quark mass finite",

    "the resulting light - quark part is combined with the heavy - quark part before it is dimensionally regularized at @xmath54 . equating the two sides for @xmath55 and assuming quark - hadron duality yield the sum rules , from which masses of hadrons can be determined . after making a borel transform and transferring the continuum contribution to the ope side ,",
    "the sum rules can be written as @xmath56 @xmath57 where @xmath58 indicates the borel parameter . to eliminate the hadron coupling constant @xmath59 and extract the resonance mass @xmath45",

    ", it is known that one can analyze the ope convergence and the pole contribution dominance to determine the conventional borel window for @xmath58 in the standard qcd sum rule approach : on the one hand , the lower constraint for @xmath76 is obtained by considering that the perturbative contribution should be larger than each condensate contribution to have a good convergence in the ope side ; on the other hand , the upper bound for @xmath76 is obtained by the consideration that the pole contribution should be larger than the continuum state contributions . meanwhile ,",
    "the threshold @xmath77 is not arbitrary but characterizes the beginning of continuum states .",
    "therefore , one naturally expects to find conventional borel windows for studied states to make qcd sum rules work commendably .",
    "however , things go contrary to one s wishes in some cases and it may be difficult to find a conventional work window rigidly satisfying both of two rules , which has been discussed in some works ( e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) . referring to the present work , there also arises some similar problem .",
    "concretely , some condensates are very large and play an important role in the ope side , which makes the standard ope convergence ( i.e. the perturbative at least larger than each condensate contribution ) happen only at very large values of @xmath58 .",
    "the consequence is that it is difficult to find a conventional borel window where both the ope converges well ( the perturbative at least larger than each condensate contribution ) and the pole dominates over the continuum .    to obtain some useful hadronic information from qcd sum rules",
    ", one could try releasing the rigid convergence criterion of the perturbative contribution larger than each condensate contribution in some case .",
    "the comparison between pole and continuum contributions from sum rule ( [ sumrule2 ] ) for @xmath1 state for @xmath78 is shown in the left panel of fig . 1 , and its ope convergence by comparing the perturbative with other condensate contributions is shown in the right panel .",
    "not too bad for the present plight , there are four main condensates ( i.e. @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 ) and they could cancel out each other to some extent since they have different signs . besides , most of other condensates calculated are very small and almost negligible .",
    "thus , one could try releasing the rigid ope convergence criterion ( i.e. the perturbative larger than each condensate contribution ) and restrict the ratio of the perturbative to the  total ope contribution \" ( the sum of the perturbative and other condensates calculated ) at least larger than one half , for example @xmath83 or more . in other words , here we consider the perturbative dominating over the sum of condensates instead of the perturbative larger than each condensate .",
    "furthermore , it is also very important that we have examined that condensates higher than dimension @xmath2 are quite small and the ratio of the perturbative to the  total ope contribution \" does not change much even adding them ( in the total ope contribution ) , which means that condensates higher than dimension @xmath2 could not radically influence the character of ope convergence here .",
    "all the above factors bring that the ratio of the perturbative to the  total ope contribution \" can be bigger than @xmath83 at relatively low values of @xmath76 in this work . by way of parenthesis",
    ", one could also visually see that there exist very stable plateaus from the borel curves for the @xmath1 state shown in fig .",
    "= 5.8truecm=5.8truecm    = 5.8truecm    = 5.8truecm    all in all , to test the ope convergence , we have considered the ratio of the perturbative to the  total ope contribution \" instead of the ratio of the perturbative to each condensate contribution .",
    "this treatment is not freewheeling but has some definite constraints ( i.e. there are merely few important condensates and they could cancel out each other to some extent ; other condensates are almost negligible ) . in this sense",
    ", one could expect that the ope convergence is still under control .",
    "we must truthfully admit that it is not a so good ope convergence as the conventional case , but then one could find a comparatively reasonable work window and extract the hadronic information from qcd sum rules reliably .",
    "thus , we choose some transition range @xmath84 as a compromise borel window and take the continuum thresholds as @xmath85 , and arrive at @xmath86 for @xmath1 state .",
    "considering the uncertainty rooting in the variation of quark masses and condensates , we gain @xmath87 ( the first error reflects the uncertainty due to variation of @xmath77 and @xmath76 , and the second error resulted from the variation of qcd parameters ) or @xmath3 for @xmath1 state .    on account of the difficulty encountered in finding a conventional borel window",
    ", one may suppose the nonexistence of @xmath88 molecule itself .",
    "as one possibility , the assumption of its nonexistence indeed should be drawn attention . however , in the present work , we are inclined to make a premise that the @xmath88 molecular state could exist and then study whether it could act as one potential explanation of @xmath0 in view of two mian points : i ) the possibility for the existence of @xmath1 molecule and the molecular interpretation of @xmath0 are not entirely fabricated without any grounds . by an effective lagrangian calculation @xcite ,",
    "_ found that @xmath29 and nucleon can form a loosely bound state with the small binding energy , and @xmath0 can be well explained as the @xmath1 molecular hadron , which is supported by both the analysis of the mass spectrum and the study of its dominant decay channel .",
    "moreover , the observed @xmath89 can also be reasonably described .",
    "ii ) we believe the present result from qcd sum rules could provide another support to the @xmath1 explanation to @xmath0 .",
    "certainly , we must confess to a weakness that it is difficult to find the conventional borel window in the present case . just as we have stated above",
    ", one could try releasing the rigid ope convergence criterion and eventually find the ope convergence is still under control in the present case .",
    "although it is not a so good ope convergence as the conventional case , one could find a comparatively reasonable work window and safely extract the hadronic information from qcd sum rules",
    ".    there comes forth the same problem for @xmath4 as the above case for @xmath1 , and we treat it similarly .",
    "the mass of @xmath4 state as a function of @xmath76 from sum rule ( [ sum rule q ] ) is shown in fig .",
    "3 . graphically , one can see there have very stable plateaus for borel curves .",
    "we choose a compromise borel window @xmath90 and take @xmath91 for @xmath4 state . in the work windows ,",
    "we obtain @xmath92 for @xmath4 state .",
    "varying input values of quark masses and condensates , we attain @xmath93 ( the first error reflects the uncertainty due to variation of @xmath77 and @xmath76 , and the second error resulted from the variation of qcd parameters ) or @xmath5 for @xmath4 state .",
    "assuming the newly observed structure @xmath0 by babar collaboration as a @xmath1 molecular state , we calculate its mass value in the framework of qcd sum rules .",
    "technically , contributions of operators up to dimension @xmath2 are included in the ope .",
    "we find that it is difficult to find the conventional ope convergence in this work . via trying releasing the rigid ope convergence criterion",
    ", one could find that the ope convergence is still under control in the present work and the final numerical result for @xmath1 state is @xmath3 , which coincides with the experimental value @xmath9 . in view of",
    "that the conventional ope convergence is not obtained here , thus only weak conclusions can be drawn regarding the explanation of @xmath0 in terms of a @xmath1 molecular state .",
    "meanwhile , one should note that the @xmath88 molecular state is just one possible theoretical interpretation of @xmath0 and there may have some other different explanations for its configuration .",
    "one could expect that contributions from both future experimental observations and theoretical analysis will further reveal the nature structure of @xmath0 .",
    "additionally , we have also studied the bottom counterpart @xmath4 state and predicted its mass to be @xmath5 . by analogy with @xmath1 state , this bottom counterpart state",
    "could be searched in the @xmath94 invariant mass spectrum in future experiments .",
