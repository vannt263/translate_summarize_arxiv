    "the standard model ( sm ) accurately describes the observed phenomena but leaves several fundamental questions unanswered .",
    "many extensions of the sm have been developed to solve these puzzles .",
    "the lep collider with its multi - purpose detectors aleph , delphi , l3 and opal provided an excellent environment to explore possibilities beyond the sm both through direct searches for new processes and through precise measurements of electroweak ( ew ) parameters . since 1996 when the centre - of - mass energy first reached the ww production threshold , 700 pb@xmath0 of data per experiment were collected at @xmath1 gev , of which 130 pb@xmath0 were recorded at @xmath2 gev .    in the following the latest lep results are summarised on the various flavours of supersymmetric models , theories with extra dimensions and a few selected topics from the rich field of exotic phenomena . for each model",
    "the phenomenological framework , the search strategy and the achieved results ( constraints at the 95% confidence level ) are briefly discussed .    in most cases the experiments provide limits on the production cross - section of the studied processes with minimal model assumptions , which are then interpreted within the framework of a given model to derive constraints on the model parameters , particle masses .",
    "where available , the combined results of the four lep experiments , labelled by adlo , are presented .",
    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is a particularly promising extension of the sm being theoretically well - motivated and also very successful from the phenomenological point of view .    for each sm",
    "particle chirality state susy predicts a superpartner differing in spin by half a unit . if susy were an exact symmetry the particles and their superpartners would be degenerate in mass , thus susy must be broken .",
    "traditionally two theoretical scenarios are examined : gravity - mediated and gauge - mediated susy breaking .",
    "both mechanisms assume that susy is broken in a _ hidden _ sector and susy breaking is transmitted from there to the _ visible _ sector where the sm and susy particles ( sparticles ) live . in models with gravity",
    "mediated susy breaking ( supergravity ) the visible and hidden sectors are coupled via gravitational interaction , while in models with gauge mediated susy breaking ( gmsb ) the hidden sector couples to a _ messenger _ sector which in turn couples to the visible sector via gauge interactions .",
    "susy fields can mix , thus the interaction eigenstates can differ from the mass eigenstates .",
    "the mixing of left- and right - handed scalar fermions ( l- , r - sfermions , @xmath3 ) is proportional to the corresponding fermion mass and is negligible for the first two generations .",
    "the fermionic partners of the weakly interacting gauge and higgs ) . ] bosons form six mass eigenstates : the charged higgsino and wino states give two charginos ( @xmath4 ) , and the neutral bino , wino and higgsino states give four neutralinos ( @xmath5 ) , where the indices @xmath6 are ordered by increasing mass .",
    "the fermionic partners of the strongly interacting gluons called gluinos ( @xmath7 ) do not mix with other states .      in the most general case , mssm has more than a hundred parameters in addition to the sm ones .",
    "they include the couplings in the superpotential and the masses and couplings in the soft susy breaking terms",
    ".    in a constrained framework of mssm ( cmssm ) , also called minimal supergravity , the soft susy breaking parameters take a simple form at the planck scale : the scalar squared masses and the scalar couplings are flavour diagonal and universal . taking also the more general prediction of the unification of gaugino masses ,",
    "the number of parameters in the soft susy breaking term can be reduced to four : the common scalar mass ( @xmath8 ) , scalar trilinear coupling ( @xmath9 ) , gaugino mass ( @xmath10 ) and the bilinear coupling of higgs fields ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "@xmath11 can be exchanged to the ratio of the vacuum expectation values ( v.e.v.s ) of the higgs fields ( @xmath12 ) and @xmath10 to the su(2 ) gaugino mass parameter at the ew scale ( @xmath13 ) . for the u(1 ) gaugino mass parameter . ]",
    "the mass parameters should not exceed @xmath14(tev ) so that susy remains a solution to the naturalness problem .",
    "in addition to the coupling @xmath15 of the higgs fields , the superpotential can also contain @xmath16-parity violating couplings @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 are generation indices .",
    "@xmath16-parity is a multiplicative quantum number which takes the value of + 1 for sm particles and @xmath201 for their superpartners .",
    "if @xmath16-parity is conserved the constrained model can be described by only five extra parameters .",
    "the assumption of @xmath16-parity conservation has a crucial impact on supersymmetric phenomenology .",
    "it implies that sparticles are always produced in pairs and decay through cascade processes to sm particles and to the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) , which is stable . if the lsp is neutral and weakly interacting , as favoured by cosmological considerations , it escapes detection , resulting in sizable missing energy .",
    "all sparticles are expected to be pair - produced at lep via @xmath21-channel @xmath22 or z exchange . for third generation sfermions",
    "the production cross - section depends on the mixing between the left- and right - handed fields . @xmath23 and",
    "@xmath24 pair - production has @xmath25-channel contribution , as well , and their cross - section strongly depends on the model parameters .",
    "susy phenomenology is largely determined by the nature of the lsp and the next - to - lsp ( nlsp ) .",
    "the lsp is usually considered to be the lightest neutralino ( or the sneutrino ) . accordingly , the following processes are searched for :    @xmath26 =    * chargino : * @xmath27 with @xmath28 decaying via @xmath29w@xmath30 or @xmath31 ; + @xmath32 ;    * neutralino : * @xmath33ff ) and @xmath34 with @xmath35 decaying via @xmath29z , @xmath29h / a or @xmath36 ;    * sleptons : * @xmath37 ;    * light squarks and sbottom : * @xmath38q ) @xmath39q ) ;    * stop : * @xmath40 via loop diagram with q = c , u ; + @xmath41 .",
    "the chargino production cross - section is large except if @xmath42 is light and the destructive interference between @xmath21- and @xmath25-channel processes becomes important . in this case",
    "the search for neutralino production improves our sensitivity for susy . if sfermions are heavy ( @xmath43 gev ) , @xmath28 and @xmath35 decay dominantly via a w and a z boson , respectively .",
    "the event properties depend significantly on the mass difference ( @xmath44 ) between the pair - produced sparticle and the lsp . in the chargino search , for example , the case of 200 mev @xmath45 gev",
    "is treated separately using a dedicated analysis of events with initial state radiation , and for @xmath46 200 mev events with tracks displaying kinks or impact parameter offsets and events with heavy stable charged particles are studied . in cmssm low @xmath44",
    "is expected in the higgsino region ( @xmath47 ) ; a lower limit on the chargino mass of 92.4 gev is obtained independent of @xmath44 by the adlo combination@xcite .    the cross - section for @xmath48 is smaller than for @xmath49 , therefore @xmath49 is usually assumed to be out of the reach for the experiments and results for @xmath48 are given",
    ". for staus mixing may be sizable : the mass limits@xcite shown on fig.[fig : sfermion ] worsen by a few gev when the z boson is decoupled ( @xmath50 ) .    using the standard searches for chargino and slepton production , and developing dedicated analyses for @xmath51 to cover the small @xmath52 region and for @xmath53 in the so - called _ corridor _ where the chargino and the sneutrino are degenerate in mass , the aleph collaboration set absolute lower limits on the @xmath54 and @xmath55 masses@xcite of 73 , 107 and 84 gev , respectively , assuming sfermion and gaugino mass unification and no sfermion mixing . including the constraints from neutral higgs boson searches ,",
    "the results on the selectron masses can be improved to 77 and 115 gev for a top mass of 175 gev .",
    "within cmssm for @xmath56 the obtained bounds are 95 , 152 and 130 gev , respectively .",
    "if kinematically allowed , the @xmath57b decay mode is dominant over @xmath29c .",
    "the combined lep results@xcite exclude stop and sbottom masses up to 94@xmath20100 gev for @xmath58 gev depending on the search channel and the mixing angle .",
    "if charginos and sleptons are light , four - body stop decays @xmath59 @xmath60 can be enhanced , leading to less stringent limits on the stop mass@xcite than those on fig.[fig : sfermion ] .",
    "aleph performed a search for stop production with small @xmath44 looking for charged particle tracks with significant lifetime .",
    "the obtained absolute mass limit is 63 gev independent of the values of @xmath61 and @xmath12 explored in the scan@xcite .",
    "the searches for acoplanar jets can be translated into constraints shown in fig.[fig : sfermion ] on mass degenerate squarks ( left- and right - handed @xmath62 ) within the mssm with lowest order gut relations between the soft susy - breaking gaugino mass terms@xcite .    when combining the negative results of chargino , neutralino , slepton and higgs boson searches , limits on the @xmath29 lsp mass can be obtained as shown in fig.[fig : neutralino ] assuming gaugino and sfermion mass unification at the gut scale and negligible mixing in the stau sector@xcite .",
    "stau mixing may lead to scenarios with mass degenerate stau and lsp and weaken the derived limits at large @xmath12 .",
    "dedicated searches for @xmath63 and @xmath64 cover this region .",
    "within cmssm , using also the constraints from the measurement of the z width and the searches for heavy stable stau production , the obtained bounds on the parameters , see fig.[fig : neutralino ] , can be translated into 52.0@xmath2059.0 gev lower limits on the lsp mass@xcite depending on sign@xmath15 and the top mass for @xmath65 and @xmath66 tev .",
    "there are no theoretical or experimental arguments excluding @xmath16-parity violation ( rpv ) , moreover , the branching ratios of @xmath16-parity violating decay modes of sparticles can be comparable or even larger than the @xmath16-parity conserving ones .",
    "if @xmath16-parity is violated , sparticles can be singly produced and can decay directly to sm particles .",
    "therefore , the predicted signatures differ from the characteristic missing energy signature of @xmath16-parity conserving processes .    with the mssm particle content , @xmath16-parity",
    "violating interactions are described with a gauge - invariant superpotential that includes the following yukawa terms - parity could be spontaneously broken through a @xmath67 acquiring a non - zero v.e.v .",
    "this can be described by a bilinear term @xmath68 . ] : @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are lepton and quark left - handed doublet superfields , @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 are right - handed singlet charge - conjugate superfields for the charged leptons , down- and up - type quarks , respectively , and @xmath19 are the generation indices of the superfields .",
    "@xmath75 is non - vanishing only if @xmath76 , and @xmath77 is non - vanishing only for @xmath78 , therefore there are a total of 45 @xmath16-parity violating yukawa couplings .",
    "it is usually assumed that the sparticles are pair - produced via @xmath16-parity conserving processes described in sec.[sec : rpc ] .",
    "two different scenarios are then probed . in the first scenario ,",
    "called indirect decays , the decays of sfermions via the lightest neutralino , @xmath29 , are considered , where @xmath29 is treated as the lsp and assumed to decay via an @xmath16-parity violating yukawa coupling . in the second scenario , direct decays of sparticles to sm particles are investigated . in this case , the sparticle is assumed to be the lsp , such that @xmath16-parity conserving decay modes do not contribute . in both scenarios , it is assumed that only one of the 45 yukawa couplings is non - zero at a time , motivated by constraints from low energy experiments .",
    "it is also assumed that the lsp decays promptly , implying a very short lifetime , and therefore a mass larger than 10 gev for the lightest neutralino .",
    "the topologies resulting from rpv decays of pair - produced sparticles are numerous and extremely varied : direct decays of sfermions lead to 4-fermion , direct decays of charginos and neutralinos to 6-fermion , indirect decays of sfermions to 8-fermion and finally indirect decays of charginos to 10-fermion final states with almost any combination of species and flavours of final state particles .",
    "the first lep combined results@xcite are shown in fig.[fig : lle ] for indirect decays of sleptons via @xmath79 couplings .",
    "in general the limits for @xmath80 and @xmath81 couplings@xcite are less stringent due to the presence of more final state quark jets .",
    "the results of the chargino and neutralino searches are used to constrain the @xmath82 plane for a given @xmath8 and @xmath12 as shown in fig.[fig : mu - m2 ] .",
    "when combining all rpv searches absolute lower limits are also derived on the sparticle masses from a scan of the cmssm parameter space .    by studying single @xmath67 production in the e@xmath83 process the aleph collaboration set upper limits on @xmath84 couplings assuming that the sneutrinos are degenerate in mass .",
    "these results improve existing limits from charged current universality for masses @xmath85 gev@xcite . from the search for resonant @xmath67 production@xcite the delphi collaboration derived limits on @xmath86 couplings",
    "most stringent ( few times 10@xmath87 ) for @xmath67 masses close to the lep centre - of - mass energies .      in the minimal version of gmsb ,",
    "six new parameters are introduced in addition to the sm parameters : the susy breaking scale ( @xmath88 ) , the messenger scale ( @xmath89 ) , the messenger index giving the number of messenger particle sets ( @xmath90 ) , the mass scale which determines the susy particle masses at the messenger scale ( @xmath91 ) , the ratio of the v.e.v.s of the two higgs doublets ( @xmath12 ) and the sign of the higgs sector mixing parameter ( sign@xmath15 ) .    in gmsb , the susy partner of the graviton",
    ", the gravitino ( @xmath92 ) , is expected to be the lsp with a mass , typically less than 1 gev , determined by @xmath88 .",
    "the nlsp is either the lightest neutralino or a slepton . in the latter case",
    "two possibilities are considered : a stau nlsp or slepton co - nlsps when all sleptons are light and degenerate in mass .",
    "the experimental signatures crucially depend on the nlsp decay length which can take basically any value .    in the neutralino nlsp scenario neutralinos",
    "are either produced in pairs directly or indirectly via slepton ( @xmath93 @xmath94 @xmath95 ) and chargino ( @xmath96 @xmath97 @xmath98 ) pair - production or neutralino cascade decay ( @xmath99 @xmath100 @xmath101 ) , if the corresponding sparticles are light .",
    "the lightest neutralino will decay into a gravitino and a photon , giving topologies with photon pairs and missing energy . depending on its lifetime the photons are either originating from the interaction point or have a large impact parameter .",
    "indirect production of neutralinos plays an important role if the neutralino lifetime is long , and therefore the direct pair - production is invisible . in fig.[fig : gmsb - xsec ] the upper limit on the cross - section of neutralino production is shown for prompt decays , together with the excluded regions on the @xmath102 mass plane@xcite . combining searches for all lifetimes the aleph collaboration reports@xcite a neutralino lsp mass limit of 54 gev .    in the case of slepton nlsp , which is expected to decay into a lepton and a gravitino",
    ", the events are characterised by leptons and missing energy . in the slepton co -",
    "nlsp case the sleptons are either pair - produced directly , or through chargino ( @xmath103 @xmath104 @xmath105 ) and neutralino production ( @xmath106 @xmath107 @xmath108 ) .",
    "the picture is slightly different in the stau - nlsp scenario , where stau production can also happen through @xmath109 or @xmath110 pair - production ( @xmath111 @xmath94 @xmath112 @xmath113 @xmath114 ) .",
    "on fig.[fig : gmsb - xsec ] the excluded regions are shown in the @xmath115 mass  lifetime plane from the searches for slepton pair - production with different lifetimes@xcite .    by scanning the gmsb parameter space constraints on the parameters and absolute limits on the sparticle masses can be derived .",
    "the excluded regions on the @xmath116 plane@xcite are shown in fig.[fig : gmsbscan ] together with the obtained mass limits@xcite .",
    "models with extra dimensions have been introduced to solve the hierarchy problem of the sm through geometrical considerations . the original model of arkani - hamed  dimopoulos  dvali ( add ) of large extra dimensions appeared in 1998 and triggered the development of a vast number of new models .",
    "most lep results are derived in the add framework , which assumes @xmath117 compact extra dimensions of size @xmath16 , with the planck scale , @xmath118 , in @xmath119 dimensions set close to the ew scale .",

    "at lep single top production can be searched for in several theoretical frameworks , such as flavour changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) , 4-fermion contact interactions or r - parity violating susy@xcite .    in the sm fcnc",
    "is forbidden at tree level in good agreement with the observed low rates of such processes , thus all extensions of the sm must face the challenge to sufficiently suppress fcnc . on the other hand fcnc processes are ideal to look for new physics due to the small sm background .",
