    "the vacuum polarization effects play an important role in precision theory of energy levels and wave functions of atoms . while in conventional atoms such as hydrogen the effects of the self energy of an electron",
    "dominate over the vacuum polarization , in atoms with a heavier orbiting particle ( such as a muon or pion ) the vacuum polarization is responsible for the dominant qed effects .    in principle , studies of pionic and other exotic atoms involve effects of the strong interaction .",
    "there is a direct interaction of the pion and the nucleus . additionally , the finite - nuclear - size effects are important .",
    "however , relations between values of various contributions depend on values of the nuclear charge @xmath2 and of the principal and orbital quantum numbers , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively",
    ". there are certain situations where the vacuum polarization dominates . in a number of other cases , it produces a correction , which is not dominant , but still important .    in this paper",
    "we focuss on study of effects of the vacuum polarization within a relativistic framework .",
    "their leading contribution to the energy levels is related to so - called uehling potential , a correction to the coulomb potential induced by a free electronic vacuum loop .",
    "the non - relativistic results in muonic atoms ( i.e. , the results in the leading order in @xmath1 ) have been known for a while @xcite as well as various numerical relativistic calculations for the conventional ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) and muonic ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) atoms .",
    "a relativistic calculation of vacuum polarization effects can be performed analytically . in particular",
    ", various effects induced by the uehling potential were studied for the dirac equation , i.e. , for an orbiting particle with spin @xmath5 , in @xcite .",
    "the results were obtained in a closed analytic form as a function of @xmath1 and a mass ratio of the orbiting particle and an electron .",
    "however , the result for pionic atoms was not derived because it was unclear how to write relativistic perturbative series for particle with zero spin .    here , we extend our approach onto spinless orbiting particles , such as a pion .",
    "relativistic description of such a particle is significantly different from that of an electron .",
    "a spin-1/2 particle is described by an equation of the form @xmath6 where the hamiltonian @xmath7 is a hermitian operator and the wave function @xmath8 is its eigenfunction .",
    "the correction to the energy due to a perturbation by an electrostatic potential @xmath9 is of an obvious form @xmath10 in @xcite various integrals , which could appear in calculation of such a martix element over the uehling potential in coulomb bound system were studied .",
    "the equation , that describes a pion , is klein - gordon - fock equation , which for electrostatic potential is of the form @xmath11\\phi_i({\\bf r})=0\\;.\\]]this equation can not be considered as a problem for eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of a hermitian operator .",
    "the solutions of this equation , @xmath12 , are not orthogonal and their normalization is not trivial .",
    "while ` exact ' solution of the klein - gordon - fock equation with a non - coulomb potential has been possible ( see , e.g. , study of the problem of falling to the center in @xcite and numerical calculations in @xcite ) , the perturbative theory with the coulomb field has not been developed .",
    "a simple perturbative series for the klein - gordon - fock equation has not been known until now and here we apply a recent result obtained in @xcite . in particular , the analog of eq .",
    "( [ shre ] ) , convenient for analytic calculations , is @xmath13 this equation is valid for any perturbation that can be described by a certain electrostatic potential and , in particular , for the uehling correction .    to calculate the uehling correction we consider the coulomb problem as an unperturbed case .",
    "its eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are known ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) : @xmath14 where @xmath15 stands for spherical harmonics , @xmath16 is the confluent hypergeometric function , @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the mass of the orbiting particle , presumably , a pion . here , @xmath19 is a normalization factor , unspecified in @xcite , which is sufficient for our calculation , since the normalization is unimportant for any application of eq .",

    "we consider only circular states ( @xmath0 ) , in which the wave function is of the simplest form @xmath20 such states in particular include the @xmath21 and @xmath22 states .",
    "some of these states are also of experimental interest : the ground state ( @xmath21 ) is the easiest to create .",
    "meantime , high-@xmath4 states are easier for theoretical interpretation because of a substantial reduction of the strong - interaction effects .    the uehling potential , which is considered as a perturbation of the unperturbed problem with the coulomb potential , is of the form @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the electron mass .",

    "for instance , in a dirac atom with a point - like nucleus the hyperfine interval ( which can be considered as a perturbative correction to the electron energy levels due to an interaction with the nuclear spin ) for the @xmath21 state is well defined for a narrower range ( @xmath42 ) than the leading term , namely , the coulomb energy .",
