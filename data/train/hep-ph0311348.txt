    "the pattern of fermion masses and mixing remains a fascinating , unsolved puzzle . within the standard model ( sm )",
    "fermion masses and mixing are generated after gauge symmetry breaking ; their flavour structure is arbitrary , since no symmetry of the sm constrains the flavour dependence of yukawa couplings .",
    "the recent evidence for neutrino oscillations implies non - vanishing neutrino masses , which in turn requires an extension of the sm . within the sm , neutrinos are strictly massless , since no dirac masses are possible because of the absence of right - handed neutrinos , and no left - handed majorana masses can be generated in higher orders owing to exact b - l conservation .",
    "the simplest extension of the sm , which leads to non - vanishing neutrino masses , consists of adding to the spectrum of the sm three right - handed neutrinos ( one per generation ) . if no other symmetries are introduced , one is then naturally led to non - vanishing , but naturally small , neutrino masses through the see - saw mechanism .",
    "it was suggested some time ago that the diversity of quark masses and mixing may be closely related to the fact that yukawa couplings are the only couplings of the sm that can be complex . in particular , it was shown that the observed pattern of quark masses and mixing can be accounted for within the framework of the universality of strength of yukawa couplings ( usy ) , where yukawa couplings all have the same modulus , the flavour dependence being all contained in the phases @xcite .",
    "this leads to mass matrices of the form : @xmath1 $ ] .",
    "these mass matrices have very interesting properties @xcite @xcite , and it was shown @xcite that such a pattern can be generated in the context of extra dimensions with fermions localized in a thick brane .",
    "the usy hypothesis was extended to the leptonic sector in previous works , and in particular it was shown in @xcite that it is possible within usy to obtain the large mixing angle solar solution ( lma ) together with large atmospheric mixing .",
    "constraints on the structure of the neutrino mass matrix and cp violation and their implications can be analysed @xcite , based solely on the current data available from experiments with solar @xcite , @xcite and atmospheric @xcite neutrinos , reactor experiments @xcite , @xcite , neutrinoless double beta decay searches @xcite , astrophysics and cosmology @xcite .",
    "if cp were conserved in the leptonic sector , all six of the independent entries of the effective low energy neutrino mass @xmath2 , resulting from the see - saw mechanism , could be determined from experiment , through the measurement of three neutrino masses and three mixing angles .",
    "if one assumes the general situation , one is led to leptonic cp violation at low energies , with a @xmath3 complex symmetric effective neutrino mass matrix , corresponding to six independent moduli and three phases .",
    "it has been emphasized @xcite that this leads to a situation where _ no currently conceivable set of feasable experiments can fully determine the neutrino mass matrix_. this is because realistic experiments can only measure seven independent quantities , to wit @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 ( i.e. two squared neutrino mass differences , three mixing angles , the dirac - type cp violating phase and the effective mass element relevant to neutrinoless double beta decay , which is sensitive to the presence of majorana phases ) .",
    "this observation led to various suggestions to limit the number of parameters in the neutrino mass matrix , such as the possibility that the neutrino mass matrix has texture zeros @xcite , @xcite .",
    "an alternative proposal , to remove the ambiguities in the reconstruction of the neutrino mass matrix , consists of imposing the weak basis ( wb)-independent condition @xmath11 , without imposing texture zeros @xcite . in this paper",
    "we apply the usy hypothesis together with the condition that the determinant of @xmath2 is zero , to construct a highly predictive scheme where not only the low energy neutrino mass matrix can be reconstructed , but we also obtain specific predictions both for low energy phenomena and for leptogenesis @xcite .",
    "we add to the spectrum of the sm three right - handed neutrino fields @xmath12 ( one per generation ) , which leads , after spontaneous symmetry breaking , to the following mass terms : @xmath13 + \\mathrm{h.c.}=   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & -\\left [ \\frac{1}{2}n_{l}^{t}\\ c\\ \\mathcal{m}^{*}n_{l}+\\overline{l_{l}^{0}}% \\ m_{l}\\ l_{r}^{0}\\right ] + \\mathrm{h.c . } \\ ; ,   \\label{lm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote the neutrino dirac mass matrix , the right - handed neutrino majorana mass matrix and the charged lepton mass matrix , respectively , @xmath17 ( written here as a line instead of a column in order to save space ) and @xmath18 is given by @xmath19 the zero entry in @xmath18 reflects the absence of a term of the form @xmath20 , which requires , in order to be generated at tree level , an extension of the higgs sector of the sm .",
    "the matrix @xmath15 corresponds to an @xmath21 invariant mass term ; therefore its entries can naturally be of a scale much higher than the electroweak scale . under this assumption ,",
    "the light neutrino masses are obtained , to an excellent approximation , from the diagonalization of the effective neutrino mass matrix defined as @xmath22 : @xmath23 in this work we suggest the following specific usy ansatz for the three different mass matrices appearing in @xmath24 : @xmath25 , &   \\quad m = c_{d}\\ \\left [   \\begin{array}{lll } 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\   1 & 1 & e^{ia } \\\\   1 & 1 & e^{ib } \\end{array }",

    "i.e. we assume that it is possible to cast all of the leptonic mass matrices simultaneously in a usy form . in order to implement the condition @xmath11",
    ", we have chosen the dirac mass matrix @xmath14 to have the usy form , but with vanishing determinant . within the usy framework ,",
    "all inequivalent forms leading to a vanishing determinant have been classified , and it was shown that there are only two classes of solutions @xcite .",
    "the majorana mass matrix is also of the usy form and it has the nice feature that its inverse has a simple form . from eq .",

    "notice that the parameter @xmath39 does not appear at low energies . in the following",
    "we show that @xmath40 , so that @xmath2 is a small perturbation around @xmath41 .",
    "the leptonic charged current interactions can then be written as : @xmath42 where the pontecorvo ",
    "sakata ( pmns ) matrix @xcite is given by @xmath43 , with @xmath44 denoting the unitary matrix entering in the diagonalization of the charged lepton mass matrix : @xmath45 we use the standard parametrization @xcite for @xmath46 , factoring out the majorana type phase @xmath47 where @xmath48 , with all @xmath49 in the first quadrant and @xmath50 ; @xmath9 is a dirac - type phase ( analogous to the one of the quark sector ) and @xmath51 is the physical phase associated with the majorana character of neutrinos . in general , for three generations , there are two majorana phases , but the fact that one of the light neutrino masses vanishes eliminates one of these phases .      in order to evaluate the predictive power of our ansatz , let us compare its number of parameters with the total number of parameters present in general with one zero neutrino mass .",
    "we will do this comparison first taking into account the full parameter space , and later considering only the parameters that are relevant in the low energy limit .      from eq .",
    "( [ mmm ] ) one sees that our ansatz is characterized by ten parameters namely @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",
    "let us now count the number of independent parameters characterizing the lepton masses and mixing in the general case , but with the implicit assumption that one light neutrino mass vanishes .",
    "the total number of parameters can be obtained by going to the wb where both @xmath16 and @xmath15 are real , diagonal . then apart from the six real parameters characterizing the eigenvalues of @xmath16 and @xmath15",
    ", one has to take into account the number of parameters needed for specifying , in the above wb , the dirac neutrino mass matrix @xmath14 , taking into account the vanishing of its determinant . in this case",
    ", it can be shown that any matrix @xmath14 can be written as : @xmath55 where @xmath56 @xmath57 are unitary matrices containing only one phase each ( ` a la kobayashi  maskawa ) and @xmath58 we have already omitted the three phases that can always be rephased away irrespective of the value of @xmath59 . from eqs .",
    "( [ wht ] ) and ( [ dpp ] ) it follows that @xmath14 is characterized by thirteen parameters , consisting of eight real numbers and five phases . together with the six eigenvalues of @xmath60 and @xmath15 , one has altogether nineteen parameters needed to specify the three leptonic mass matrices @xmath14 , @xmath16 and @xmath15",
    "this equals the number of physical quantities ( eight non - zero masses , six mixing angles , five cp violating phases ) .",
    "the condition @xmath11 eliminates one mass and one phase , so that in general with see - saw one would have twenty one parameters @xcite .",
    "this is to be compared with the ten parameters characterizing our ansatz , thus showing its high predictive power .",
    "in general , the phases appearing in @xmath14 generate cp violation both at low and at high energies , where they are essential to produce viable leptogenesis .",
    "furthermore , it has been pointed out that these cp violating phases may manifest themselves at low energies even without cp violation at high energies @xcite ; conversely it is possible to have cp violation at high energies with no cp violation at low energies @xcite either of dirac or of majorana type .",
    "although the above counting is useful in gauging the predictive power of our ansatz , it is clear that at present we can only expect to be able to measure low energy parameters .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to make an analogous counting , taking only those into account , as well as to discuss how the low energy parameters are fixed .      at low energies our ansatz",
    "is characterized by eight parameters , namely , @xmath61 , @xmath27 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , whilst ten parameters are needed to parametrize low energy data , namely @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 , @xmath72 ( the two non - vanishing light neutrino masses ) , and also @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath73 , @xmath9 , and @xmath51 , which characterize the pmns matrix .",
    "the three independent real parameters @xmath27 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 in @xmath16 are fixed once we impose the correct values for the charged lepton masses .",
    "taking into account the charged lepton mass hierarchy , we find the following approximate relations @xcite : @xmath74 with all four parameters of @xmath16 fixed , the diagonalizing matrix @xmath44 is then determined @xcite : @xmath75 where for @xmath76 one has , to leading order : @xmath77    the four parameters @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath78 appearing in the effective neutrino mass matrix are directly related to the light neutrino squared mass differences .",
    "we obtain for the invariants ( taking into account that @xmath79 ) @xmath80 and the trace @xmath81 of the hermitian matrix @xmath82 , expressed as functions of @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath64 : @xmath83^{2}\\ /\\ \\sin ^{2}(\\frac{b}{2 } ) \\\\   \\\\",

    "( [ quo ] ) and ( [ sin ] ) that , in the range of validity of these expressions , physics at low energies only puts constraints on the ratios @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and not on @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 separately .",
    "another interesting point is the fact that for @xmath97 , eq . ( [ sin ] ) has two very simple solutions of the form @xmath98 and @xmath99 , corresponding to straight lines in the @xmath100 plane . in the next section",

    "the numerical search for the allowed parameter space was performed with exact expressions and led to regions in the ( @xmath65 , @xmath66 ) plane in the neighbourhood of the above straight lines .    for hierarchical heavy neutrino masses ,",

    "taking @xmath28 to be of the electroweak scale ( @xmath110 ) one obtains @xmath29 of order @xmath111 gev , implying @xmath112 of the same order .",
    "heavy neutrino masses are not further constrained by experiment .",

    "it was shown in section 2 that our usy model has fewer free parameters than the total number of measurable quantities at low energies .",
    "therefore , the model predicts specific correlations among these quantities . in this section ,",
    "we first describe how the analysis was performed and present a specific interesting example , which is taken up again in the discussion of leptogenesis .",
    "next , we present , in the form of various plots , correlations between physical quantities , which are implied by our framework , and comment on the main features of our model .      in our analysis , illustrated in part by the graphs that follow , we have fixed the parameters @xmath27 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 in such a way that the pdg values @xcite given for the charged lepton masses are obtained .",

    "notice that @xmath67 is chosen to be much smaller than @xmath128 , so that heavy neutrinos have hierarchical masses ( these also depend on @xmath39 ) .",

    "were determined and compared with the currently allowed experimental ranges , consistent with the first results from k2k and kamland , as given in @xcite ( notice that @xmath6 is the solar angle and @xmath8 the atmospheric angle ) : @xmath132 these are @xmath133 ( @xmath134 ) cl intervals ; the second range of @xmath135 corresponds to solutions in the upper lma island ( at present the results of the solar and kamland analyses still allow for an ambiguity in the determination of @xmath129 at cl @xmath136 @xmath137 ) .",
    "furthermore in our programme we have imposed a cut in @xmath138 .",
    "we have used @xmath133 cl intervals for the solar and atmospheric angles ; for the mass ratio we worked with a @xmath134 cl , since it is a feature of our model that solutions with @xmath0 close to the experimental bound and leading to a large value of @xmath139 correspond to values of @xmath129 below @xmath140 .",
    "our ansatz predicts that sizable cp violation in neutrino oscillations is not compatible with the upper lma .",
    "the numerical analysis was performed with exact formulae .",
    "since we constrain the ratio of masses rather than the masses themselves , we do not need to fix @xmath141 .",
    "let us , for the sake of illustration , present a possible solution in the region @xmath142 , with both @xmath65 and @xmath66 positive : @xmath143 in this example we obtain , fixing @xmath144 ev : latexmath:[\\ ] ]    as an example , for @xmath218 gev and @xmath219 gev , which implies fixing the parameters @xmath39 and @xmath67 , together with @xmath112 , which is fixed to be of order @xmath220 as explained in section 2 , we obtain : @xmath221 where we have chosen @xmath222 , @xmath223 and @xmath224 , as in the explicit example of the previous section , together with @xmath225 and @xmath226 ev .",
    "this leads to the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe , assuming a washout factor of order @xmath227 .",

    "( [ abg ] ) .",
    "since @xmath39 is not constrained by the low energy physics , there is still a free variable parametrizing leptogenesis .",
    "varying @xmath39 corresponds to different choices of @xmath172 , which , as was pointed out in the case of hierarchy of heavy neutrino masses , is the most important of the three masses . on the other hand , low energy physics fixes the ratios @xmath230 , @xmath231 for variable @xmath67",
    "we have investigated the pattern of lepton masses and mixing within the framework of usy , where all yukawa couplings have equal modulus , the flavour structure being all contained in the phases of those couplings .    in our scheme ,",
    "three of the four parameters of the charged lepton mass matrix @xmath16 are related to the three charged lepton masses , the fourth one ( the phase @xmath91 ) giving the dominant contribution to @xmath232 ; the three parameters in the dirac neutrino mass matrix @xmath14 together with @xmath29 are constrained by the two neutrino squared mass differences ( for each choice of @xmath67 ) and by @xmath233 . furthermore , the assumption that @xmath28 is of the order of the weak scale fixes the scale of the heavy neutrino masses and , with our choice of hierarchical heavy neutrino masses , it determines , to an excellent approximation , the mass of the heaviest neutrino . the remaining parameters @xmath39 and @xmath67 are dependent on the hierarchy of the heavy neutrino masses , for which there is no experimental information available .",
    "it should be noticed that @xmath39 has no influence on low energy physics .",
    "strong hierarchy of heavy neutrino masses requires @xmath39 and @xmath67 to be much smaller than @xmath128 .",
    "hierarchical heavy neutrinos are generally favoured in scenarios of baryogenesis through leptogenesis ( together with one light neutrino with zero mass ) , since in this case the washout processes tend to be less important .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have suggested an ansatz for the leptonic flavour structure , where all the experimental data on lepton masses and mixing are reproduced and specific correlations between measurable quantities are obtained , such as @xmath160 , the ratio of neutrino squared mass differences , the strength of leptonic dirac - type cp violation and the mass parameter @xmath10 , measurable in neutrinoless double beta decay . in particular , in the scheme we propose , it is possible to have @xmath160 close to the present experimental bound together with a large value for @xmath113 , provided the ratio @xmath234/@xmath155 lies within the lower values of the experimentally allowed range . in this case",
    "the observation of leptonic cp violation due to a dirac - type cp violating phase would be within the reach of future neutrino experiments .",
    "finally , it was shown that in this scheme a sufficient amount of baryon asymmetry of the universe can be generated through leptogenesis .",

    "<S> we propose a flavour structure for the leptonic sector of the standard model , based on the idea of universality of yukawa couplings , which accommodates all the experimental data on neutrino masses and mixing , at the same time predicting specific correlations between low energy measurable quantities , such as the ratio of neutrino squared mass differences , @xmath0 , the leptonic dirac phase , and the double - beta decay mass parameter . </S>",
    "<S> we also point out that it is possible , in this framework , to generate a sufficient amount of baryon asymmetry of the universe through leptogenesis . </S>"
