    "the recent experiment on neutrino oscillations  @xcite strongly suggests the nonzero masses of neutrinos . among all the models of neutrino masses , one of the most attractive ways to generate",
    "the smallness of neutrino masses is the seesaw mechanism  @xcite , which introduces right - handed massive neutrinos .",
    "since the right - handed neutrinos are so heavy , we usually integrate them out and consider the low energy effective theory with only the left - handed neutrinos .",
    "however , it is possible that the low energy effective theory might miss some of the essential features of cp violation in the seesaw model .",
    "therefore it is important to study the general structure of the phases in the mixing matrix in the seesaw model which give the cp violation and the lepton number asymmetry .",
    "when we integrate out the heavy mode and consider the low energy effective theory , which we call as `` decoupling case '' throughout this paper , all the cp violating phases on the lepton sector are contained in the unitary 3 @xmath1 3 mns mixing matrix  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , when we consider the full theory of seesaw model with the heavy right - handed neutrinos , which we call as `` non - decoupling case '' , the mns matrix is 3 @xmath1 6 matrix .",
    "the goal of this paper is to understand degrees of freedom of independent cp violating phases contained in the 3 @xmath1 6 mns matrix in the non - decoupling case , understand where the difference from the conventional decoupling case arises , and show how the phase including can be determined from experimental observation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we introduce the extended mns matrix and count the physical degrees of freedom of the matrix which remains after imposing unitarity conditions and seesaw conditions and using the rephasing symmetry from which we find that there exist six independent phases . as an explicit example , we confirm this result in a special case where the mns matrix can be explicitly parametrized . in section 3",
    "we study how to determine the phase of the mns matrix and show that one phase is sensitive in neutrino oscillations , two phases are sensitive in neutrinoless double beta decay and the other three phases are sensitive in lepton number asymmetry .",
    "we also present geometrical interpretation of the effects of the phases hidden in yukawa coupling .",
    "finally , we discuss and conclude the results of our work in section 4 .",
    "the lagrangian of the seesaw model is given as follows @xmath2 where @xmath3 .",
    "without loss of generality we can start with real diagonal matrix for @xmath4 .",
    "this lagrangian gives mass term as @xmath5 where the mass matrix @xmath6 is a symmetric matrix given as follows , @xmath7 where we define a matrix as @xmath8_{ij}=y_{\\nu}^{ij}$ ] .",
    "hence , this mass matrix can be diagonalized by unitary matrix v , i.e. @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is mixing matrix , @xmath11    the charged current @xmath12 , where indices i = 1,2,3 and @xmath13=1,2, .. ,6 .",
    "since we can always start with mass eigenstate for charged lepton , then the mns matrix is nothing but the mixing matrix @xmath10 itself ,    @xmath14    it s clear from ( [ 5 ] ) that @xmath15 is @xmath16 matrix .",
    "+ we now count the physical degrees of freedom contained in this complex matrix @xmath15 . for n generations",
    ", @xmath15 is @xmath17 complex matrix .",
    "hence , it has @xmath18 real and imaginary parts respectively .",
    "this matrix satisfies two conditions .",
    "first is the unitarity condition which is given in the form below , @xmath19 @xmath20 is 3@xmath13 unit matrix .",
    "the unitarity condition gives @xmath21 constraints for real parts and @xmath22 for imaginary parts , i.e. , phases .",
    "the second is the very special condition coming from the seesaw type mass matrix .",
    "we call it _ seesaw condition _ from zeros of the matrix ( [ 3 ] ) and the diagonalization leads to @xmath23 the seesaw condition gives @xmath21 constraints for real parts and @xmath21 for phases . by taking into account the unitarity and seesaw conditions , there remain @xmath24 real parts and @xmath25 phases . finally , after absorbing n unphysical phases into the charged lepton fields we have @xmath24 independent physical phase .",
    "the total independent parameters are summarized in table below .",
    "table i    @xmath26 } & \\mbox{unitarity } & \\mbox{seesaw } & \\mbox{rephasing } & \\\\ \\hline   \\mbox{real } & 2n^{2 } & n+\\frac{n^{2}-n}{2 } & \\frac{n^{2}+n}{2 } & & n^{2}-n \\\\ \\hline   \\mbox{im } & 2n^{2 } & \\frac{n^{2}-n}{2 } & \\frac{n^{2}+n}{2 } & n & n^{2}-n \\\\",
    "\\hline   \\mbox{total } & 4n^{2 } & n^{2 } & n^{2}+n & n & 2n(n-1 ) \\\\ \\hline \\end{array}\\ ] ] for @xmath27 , the number of independent phases is @xmath28 .",
    "the result is different from which could be obtained the one by integrating out the heavy neutrino , i.e. one phase for dirac neutrino and three phase for majorana neutrino .",
    "we will show how three extra phases come from .",
    "we confirm this result explicitly by taking a specific example .",
    "consider the case where the majorana masses in the heavy right - handed mass has a strong hierarchy in the diagonal basis , namely @xmath29 , in which case , the approximate diagonalization of the seesaw matrix is possible  @xcite .",
    "the idea is that starting from the decoupling limit , the mass matrix in eq.([3 ] ) can be diagonalized using a systematic expansion in @xmath30 . as a result",
    ", the @xmath15 is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a unitary matrix which transforms @xmath33 into triangular matrix @xmath34 , @xmath35 ( see @xcite and appendix a for the proof . )",
    "the diagonal elements of @xmath34 are real .",
    "the general @xmath36 yukawa coupling has nine phases .",
    "the decomposition shows that six of them are included in @xmath32 while the other three are included in the off - diagonal elements of @xmath34 . using the decomposition , we can rewrite @xmath15 as @xmath37 three of six phases in @xmath32",
    "can be absorbed into the definition of charged leptons .",
    "therefore we conclude that @xmath15 has six phases in total , three of them are in @xmath32 and the other three are in @xmath34 .",
    "this is consistent with the results shown in table i. the @xmath38 triangular matrix @xmath34 with real diagonal elements includes @xmath22 phases .",
    "this is exactly the difference of the number of independent phases between non - decoupling case and decoupling case .",
    "we call these phases as heavy phase .",
    "then , in general @xmath39 independent phase can be separated as follows @xmath40 what we call heavy phase in ( [ 11 ] ) correspond to the phases included in @xmath34 , i.e. , the extra phases come from off - diagonal elements of @xmath41 .",
    "the numbers of cp violating phases for @xmath42 and @xmath27 are given in the following    table ii    @xmath43",
    "now that we know the number of independent phase of the @xmath15 matrix , the question is how we can determine these independent phases . to answer this question we discuss the neutrino oscillations , neutrinoless double beta decay and lepton number asymmetry as phenomena which are sensitive to the phases of the extended mns matrix discussed in the previous sections .",
    "this extended mns matrix which relates @xmath44 and @xmath45 as eq.([4 ] ) , i.e. @xmath46 gives the extended amplitude for both neutrino oscillations and neutrinoless double beta decay .",
    "first , we consider the neutrino oscillations . the transition amplitude @xmath47 is extended from the decoupling case as follows @xmath48 in the last expression , we dropped the contributions from the massive neutrino since they are tiny so that we obtain the same result as in the decoupling case .",
    "hence , we obtain the asymmetry  @xcite @xmath49 since the unitary matrix u can always be transformed @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is dirac phase and @xmath52 are majorana phases ( see appendix a ) .",
    "eq.([13 ] ) represents the cp violation in neutrino oscillations and we can see that neutrino oscillation is only sensitive on dirac phase living in ckm matrix but not on majorana phase @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the similar is also the case in neutrinoless double beta decay .",
    "the amplitude is modified from the decoupling case due to the contribution from the heavy neutrino , but after taking into account the scale of momentum - energy and the neutrino masses , the expansion in components may be reduced to the same form as in the decoupling case  @xcite @xmath55 it is seen that in principle all phases of low energy sector can be determined by using double beta decay experiments , but not for the remaining three phases hidden in yukawa coupling .",
    "finally , we consider the lepton number asymmetry in the seesaw model , which was proposed as one of the most promising scenarios of baryogenesis  @xcite .",
    "the lepton number asymmetry has been studied in the flavor basis .",
    "here we rederive the formula for lepton number asymmetry in the mass basis , which is another important result of the present paper . in this basis , the lepton number asymmetry is expressed in terms of only the physical quantities such as mass and @xmath15 matrix . therefore in our result",
    "the relation of lepton number asymmetry and the cp violating phases is obvious .",
    "the relevant part of the lagrangian which may be derived from eq.([1 ] ) is . it can be shown that the decay into the longitudinal @xmath56 mesons can be approximately described by the decay into the unphysical goldstone boson . ] @xmath57 from eq.([15 ] ) we get the decay amplitudes @xmath58 , @xmath59 where the upper indices show the tree , vertex and self - energy correction respectively , whereas @xmath60 are spinors of electron and right handed majorana neutrino , and @xmath61 is @xmath62.\\label{36}\\ ] ] with @xmath63 . for one - loop amplitudes @xmath64 and @xmath65 , we have evaluated the absorptive part only which contributes to the lepton number asymmetry through the interference with tree level amplitude @xmath66 .",
    "the interference between tree level and one - loop correction of the heavy majorana neutrino decay gives the asymmetry of the lepton number @xmath67    the contribution from the interference of tree and vertex diagram is given as    ccc    [ fig : tree ]    [ fig:1loop ]    [ fig : self - energy ]    @xmath68i\\biggl(\\frac{m_{\\beta}^{2}}{m_{\\alpha}^{2}}\\biggr)\\frac{1}{\\sum_{i}|v_{mns}^{i{\\alpha}}|^{2}}. \\label{19}\\ ] ]    similarly , the interference between tree and self - energy diagram gives the asymmetry @xmath69 as    @xmath70    the asymmetry in question is summation eqs.([19 ] ) and ( [ 20 ] ) , @xmath71\\frac{1}{\\sum_{i}|v_{mns}^{i{\\alpha}}|^{2 } } \\nonumber \\\\ & ~ & { \\times}\\biggl\\{i\\biggl(\\frac{m_{\\beta}^{2}}{m_{\\alpha}^{2}}\\biggr)+\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{m_{\\alpha}^{2}}{m_{\\alpha}^{2}-m_{\\beta}^{2}}\\biggr\\}.   \\label{21}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    from fig.1 , @xmath72 is index for decaying massive right - handed neutrinos .",
    "if we write it with the new index @xmath73 , and taking into account the fact that the light neutrinos have mass much smaller than heavy ones as well as the vacuum expectation value of higgs field @xmath74 , then the contribution to the asymmetry effectively comes from the heavy part only . substituting the heavy part of @xmath15 ; of eq.([8 ] ) into ( [ 21 ] ) we obtain @xmath75\\frac{1}{\\sum_{i}|y^{il}|^{2}}\\biggl\\{i\\biggl(\\frac{m_{nk}^{2}}{m_{nl}^{2}}\\biggr)+\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{m_{nl}^{2}}{m_{nl}^{2}-m_{nk}^{2}}\\biggr\\}. \\label{22}\\ ] ] it is clear that the heavy phase appear in lepton number asymmetry at very early of the universe . summing up to the final charged lepton and expressed in @xmath34 yields @xmath76^{2}\\biggl\\{i\\biggl(\\frac{m_{nk}^{2}}{m_{nl}^{2}}\\biggr)+\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{m_{nl}^{2}}{m_{nl}^{2}-m_{nk}^{2}}\\biggr\\}.   \\label{23}\\ ] ] assuming the off - diagonal elements of @xmath34 are much smaller than the diagonal ones then the explicit form of the asymmetry ( [ 23 ] ) given as follows @xmath77 .",

    "the effects can be seen from the neutral current @xmath81 , where the explicit form of @xmath82 is given in appendix b. tree level z fcnc in the neutrino sector occurs , and the fcnc comes out at @xmath83 . in general , in this geometrical representation , the effect of @xmath84 is to open the closed polygon as given in decoupling case by unitarity mixing matrix .",
