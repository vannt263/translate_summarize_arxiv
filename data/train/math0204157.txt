    "some authors do not require these two conditions in triangulations .",
    "we will always require the first one , and when the second condition is not fulfilled , we call the decompositions _ simplicial dissections _ of @xmath0 . the _ size _ of a triangulation or dissection @xmath15 is its number of @xmath13-simplices and we denote it @xmath16",
    ". it is an open question whether high dimensional cubes admit dissections with less simplices than needed in a triangulation . actually , the minimum size of dissections of @xmath17 is unknown , while the minimum triangulation is known ( see below ) .",

    "we propose a method to obtain efficient triangulations of a product polytope @xmath51 starting from a triangulation of @xmath1 and another of @xmath52 , where @xmath53 denotes a simplex of dimension @xmath54 and @xmath4 is any relatively small number .",

    ", we prove that ( asymptotically ) the @xmath13-cube can be triangulated with @xmath60 simplices , instead of the @xmath61 achievable before .",
    "it has to be observed that , even if the particular triangulation of @xmath57 that we use was obtained by an intensive computer calculation , once the triangulation is found it is a simple task to check that it is indeed a triangulation and compute the asymptotic efficiency obtained from it .",
    "actually , in section [ sec.rholm ] we use the so - called cayley trick @xcite to do this checking with no need of computers at all .",
    "we also use the cayley trick to explore the minimum efficiency that can be obtained from the product @xmath62 for any @xmath8 .",

    "let @xmath63 and @xmath64 be triangulations of the regular cubes @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "the product @xmath65 of the two triangulations gives a decomposition of the cube @xmath66 into @xmath67 subpolytopes , each of them isomorphic to the product of simplices @xmath68 .",
    "it is well known that every triangulation of @xmath68 has size @xmath69 ( see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 7 ) ) .",
    "hence , refining @xmath65 in an arbitrary way one gets a triangulation of @xmath31 of size @xmath70 .",
    "the implication of this is that starting with a triangulation of a cube @xmath33 of a certain efficiency @xmath71 , one can construct a sequence of triangulations of @xmath72 for @xmath73 whose asymptotic efficiencies converge to @xmath71 .",
    "our method is , in a way , similar . starting from a triangulation of @xmath74 and another one of @xmath56",
    ", we get one of @xmath75 with the following general method to triangulate @xmath51 starting from a triangulation of @xmath1 and another one of @xmath76 :    1 .",

    "we call our triangulations _ multi - staircase triangulations_. 2",
    ".   a triangulation of @xmath1 induces , as in haiman s method , a decomposition of @xmath51 into polytopes isomorphic to @xmath77 .",
    "each of them can be triangulated using the previous paragraph , although this in principle only gives a dissection of @xmath51 ; if we want a triangulation , we have to apply ( 1 ) to all the polytopes @xmath77 in a compatible way . in section [ sec.triang ]",
    "we will show how to do this using an @xmath4-coloring of the vertices of @xmath1 .",
    "the analysis of the size of the triangulation obtained will also be carried out in section [ sec.triang ] .    in step ( 2 ) , the final size of the triangulation is just the sum of the individual sizes of the triangulations used for the different subpolytopes @xmath79 .",
    "in particular , if we are just interested in obtaining dissections , we can take an efficient triangulation of @xmath79 and repeat it in every subpolytope .    in step ( 1 )",
    "the computation of the size is more complicated and to state it in a simple way we introduce the following definitions .",

    "let @xmath4 be such that @xmath92 . given a triangulation @xmath93 of @xmath76 of weighted size @xmath94 and a triangulation @xmath95 of @xmath1 ,",
    "then there are triangulations of @xmath51 with size at most @xmath96    using this method to triangulate @xmath97 starting from a triangulation of @xmath74 and another one of @xmath56 we will conclude :    [ thm.triangulaciones ] if there is a triangulation @xmath93 of @xmath56 with weighted efficiency @xmath98 , then for every @xmath99 and all @xmath100 bigger than @xmath101 we have @xmath102 as a consequence , @xmath103    observe that the definition of weighted efficiency makes sense even in the case @xmath104 , where all the simplices of @xmath105 have the same type , equal to @xmath106 if @xmath107 , and the same weight , equal to @xmath108 . in particular , the weighted efficiency of a triangulation of @xmath109 is the same as the usual  non - weighted \" one .",
    "another common point between efficiency and weighted efficiency is that the weighted efficiency of a triangulation of @xmath55 is always less or equal to 1 , and it is 1 if and only if the triangulation is unimodular ; i.e. , if every simplex has volume @xmath110 ( this is proved in section [ sec.cayley ] ) .",

    "of all the triangulations of @xmath55 .",
    "the definition of this universal polytope for triangulations of an arbitrary polytope @xmath0 is as follows ( see @xcite for further details ) : let @xmath113 be the set of all the simplices of maximal dimension which use as vertices only vertices of @xmath0",

    "( to minimize non - weighted efficiency and size one just uses the functional with all coefficients equal to 1 )",
    ". one of the results in @xcite is a description of the vertices of the universal polytope as integer solutions of a certain system of linear inequalities derived from the oriented matroid of @xmath0 .",
