    "gamma - ray bursts  ( grbs ) are among the most violent explosions in the universe .",
    "they are classified into two populations by the duration of prompt emission @xmath12 : short grbs ( sgrbs ) with @xmath13 and long grbs ( lgrbs ) with @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "a widely accepted model of lgrbs is the collapsar scenario , in which a black hole ( bh ) and accretion disk system is formed after the stellar collapse , and launches a relativistic jet that breaks out the progenitor star , producing a grb @xcite .",
    "theoretical models identify the typical duration of a lgrb ( @xmath15s ) as the free - fall time of the envelope , or the sound - crossing time of the shocked envelope , of a wolf - rayet ( wr ) star @xcite . from observation we know that at least some lgrbs are accompanied by broad - lined ic supernovae ( sne ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this suggests a tight connection between grbs and progenitors with stripped envelope like wr stars .",
    "recently , some lgrbs have been discovered to show ultra - long duration of the prompt emission with @xmath16s .",
    "these have been named ultra - long gamma - ray bursts ( ulgrbs )  @xcite .",
    "the ultra - long duration was first predicted in the context of population iii ( popiii ) grbs @xcite , and subsequent studies suggested that a metal - poor blue supergiant ( bsg ) collapsar rather than the wr one is more favorable to explain such bursts @xcite . since metal - poor stars may suffer from little mass loss , metal - poor bsg stars would keep massive hydrogen envelopes until the pre - collapse phase @xcite .",
    "therefore , the accretion of the massive hydrogen envelope can lead to the long - lasting central engine activity  @xcite .",
    "since metal - poor stars are considered to be the dominant population in the high-@xmath17 universe , ulgrbs might be a dominant population of grbs in the high-@xmath17 universe  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , the existence of bhs of mass @xmath18 at @xmath1 @xcite is a great mystery in astrophysics because the accretion time is not enough to grow the bhs from the stellar mass bhs of mass @xmath19 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "many attempts are made to solve this problem .",
    "one possible solution may be the formation from popiii stars .",
    "recent numerical simulations suggest that the mass of popiii stars reaches up to @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "bhs born from these popiii stars can barely grow up to supermassive bhs of mass @xmath21 at @xmath1 , if successive high mass accretions are maintained .",
    "feedback effects from accreting bhs , however , decrease the accretion rate @xcite .",
    "thus it seems difficult for seed bhs from popiii stars to form the observed supermassive bhs without resorting to super - eddington accretion via such as bondi and cold accretion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or efficient mergers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    an attractive alternative might be the formation of supermassive stars ( smss ) of mass @xmath22 .",
    "smss may be formed in the high temperature region irradiated by the strong ultra - violet radiation from nearby galaxies @xcite .",
    "when smss end their life due to the exhaustion of their nuclear fuel or the general relativistic ( gr ) instability @xcite , they collapse to massive bhs of mass @xmath23 , so - called direct collapse bhs ( dcbhs ) .",
    "if these dcbhs are seeds , the accretion time might be enough to grow the bhs to @xmath18 at @xmath1 .",
    "various violent phenomena from the gravitational collapse of smss are expected such as the energetic neutrino bursts @xcite and sne with very huge explosion energy of @xmath24 @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "we consider ulgrbs from smss as another possibility . if smss evolve without mass ejection and collapse to form bh ",
    "disk systems , like collapsars , we can expect the launch of the relativistic jet similar to lgrbs . since smss are larger in radius than popiii first stars of mass @xmath25-@xmath26 or bsgs",
    ", we expect that the duration of ulgrbs is even longer than that of the observed ulgrbs .",
    "the detection of such ulgrbs would enable us to observe the very moment of the birth of first quasars to probe the high-@xmath17 universe .",
    "such energetic explosions might prevent the subsequent gas accretion and the growth of the dcbhs .",
    "thus , it is worth evaluating the details of relativistic jet explosions from supermassive collapsars and their observational signatures .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in  [ progenitor model ] , we show the pre - collapse stellar models of smss , which evolve from zero age main sequence ( zams ) stars . in  [ grb associated with the smss ] , we describe the method to calculate the jet dynamics in the sms envelope . in  [ results ] ,",
    "we show that the jet can break out the sms .",
    "we also discuss the observational signatures and the detectability of grbs from supermassive collapsars . in",
    " [ discussion ] , we discuss the other progenitor model in which the sms is accreting mass and collapses through the gr instability",
    ". then we estimate the event rate of grbs from smss , and discuss the effects of grbs on their environment .",
    "a summary and our conclusions are given in  [ summary ] . throughout this paper",
    ", we consider the @xmath27cdm cosmology and adopt the cosmological parameters as : @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30  @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies of the primordial star formation have suggested that smss with @xmath31 can be formed under the hot environments of first galaxies  @xcite . whereas molecular hydrogen is the primary coolant in primordial star - forming clouds , its formation is prevented under strong ultra - violet radiation from nearby galaxies , so that the temperature is kept at @xmath32 in such a cloud due to the hydrogen atomic cooling .",
    "the accretion rate onto a protostar @xmath33 can be evaluated by dividing the jeans mass @xmath34 of the star - forming cloud by the free - fall time @xmath35 : @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the sound velocity and the temperature of the cloud , and @xmath39 is the gravitational constant , respectively .",
    "we also assume that the cloud is composed of only hydrogen , for simplicity .",
    "thus , the mass accretion rate onto the protostar formed in the central region of the star - forming cloud can be as high as @xmath40-@xmath41 under such hot environments .",
    "the protostar can grow up to a sms with @xmath31 within its lifetime of @xmath42 through such a high mass accretion rate .",
    "when the mass accretion onto the protostar stops because of radiation feedback , or for other reasons , the protostar contracts onto the zams in a kelvin - helmholtz timescale . since the smss are almost fully convective and the kelvin - helmholtz timescale is short compared to the lifetime of the star , the resulting final stellar structure should be the same as long as accretion stops not too close to hydrogen depletion .",
    "after the sms runs through its nuclear burning phases , it collapses to a bh similar to a massive star when the sms collapses to a bh , it may produce a grb by launching a relativistic jet provided there is enough angular momentum .",
    "thus , we adopt this pre - collapse sms for our progenitor model .    in this paper , we focus on a supermassive progenitor with a zams mass of @xmath43 , but for comparison also consider a progenitor which has the zams mass of @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "we call the former model as `` 1e5 model '' and the latter model as `` 1e4 model '' , respectively .",
    "the density profiles of these pre - collapse smss are shown in figure  [ density profile image ] .",
    "we can see that they have very large radii of @xmath45 , which are as large as those of present - day rsgs ( green curve in fig .",
    "[ density profile image ] ) . note that the envelopes of the sms models have steeper density profiles ( @xmath46 ) than that of the rsg model ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "this is because radiation pressure dominates in the sms envelopes while gas pressure dominates in the rsg envelope ( see section [ breakout ] ) .     and",
    "@xmath44 zams stars until the nuclear fuels are exhausted in the center .",
    "the _ green curve _ shows the density profile of a rsg ( pre - supernova structure of model ` s15 ` from @xcite ) .",
    "these profiles show that smss have similar radii with a rsg but steeper density profile than that of a rsg . the _ gray dash - dotted lines _",
    "show the slope of the power - law density profiles of @xmath48 and @xmath49 as references . ]",
    "it is not trivial whether the relativistic jet can break out the envelope of the supermassive progenitors successfully since it can not break out the large envelope of rsgs  @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied relativistic jet explosions from massive popiii stars ( @xmath50 ) , and found that the jet breakout is possible despite the large radius of @xmath51 .",
    "they attributed this to the long duration of the mass accretion of the massive envelope . in this paper , we consider supermassive popiii stars which have @xmath52-@xmath43 and @xmath53 to determine whether the jet can break out of the envelope .",
    "these stars have @xmath25 times larger radii compared to the massive popiii stars considered by @xcite so that the jet might not break out the envelope .",
    "we adopt a simple jet model in which the jet luminosity varies with time and depends on the mass accretion rate onto the bh  @xcite . the sms begins to collapse , when its nuclear fuel is exhausted in the center , and forms a massive bh .",
    "we evaluate the mass accretion rate onto the central bh using the free - fall timescale as typical timescale . for each mass shell at radius @xmath54 and mass coordinate @xmath55 ,",
    "the free - fall timescale can be calculated from @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the mean density within @xmath54 .",
    "the mass accretion rate is calculated by  @xcite @xmath58    a relativistic jet will be launched from the central engine , which is composed of a bh and an accretion disk .",
    "the mechanisms of launching relativistic outflows are still uncertain , though several processes have been proposed such as mhd mechanism and neutrino - antineutrino annihilation mechanism  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite studied the jet - driven explosions from massive popiii stars and found that the mhd mechanism works long enough for the jet to break out the envelope , whereas the neutrino mechanism does not .",
    "therefore , we assume the mhd mechanism hereafter . in the mhd process",
    ", the jet luminosity can be modeled according to @xcite @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the efficiency parameter . for simplicity",
    "we assume that @xmath60 is constant .",
    "we can take into account the effect of the progenitor rotation by adjusting the parameter value @xmath61 .",
    "when a sufficiently fast - rotating progenitor collapses , it can form a bh and accretion disk system .",
    "the remainder of the star then falls onto the central bh in the accretion time @xmath62 , which can be related to the free - fall time as @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the viscosity parameter @xcite .",
    "thus , the factor @xmath64 can be absorbed into the effective value of @xmath60 .",
    "we use @xmath65 , which is calibrated to reproduce the total jet energy of typical lgrbs of @xmath66 for a wr progenitor model  @xcite .    throughout this section ,",
    "the time @xmath67 is measured in the central engine frame .",
    "we set @xmath68 as the time when the black hole is formed .",
    "since the formation mechanism of a relativistic jet is still under debates , the time of jet formation , @xmath69 , is also uncertain and should be a parameter of this study . following the previous studies , we assume that the jet is formed when the mass of bh reaches @xmath70 : @xmath71 , where the enclosed mass within the radius @xmath72 is @xmath70 , i.e. , @xmath73  @xcite . the choice of @xmath69  ( or @xmath74 ) , however , has little influence on the jet dynamics in the envelope as long as @xmath69 is much smaller than the jet break out time .",
    "in fact , we find that the jet breakout time is within a factor of two , when the jet formation time is changed as @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 in the 1e5 model .      here , we describe the jet dynamics in the progenitor envelope following the prescription in  @xcite .",
    "a relativistic jet launched from the central engine collides with the stellar matter and forms the shocked region at the jet head .",
    "the jet head is composed of the forward shock which sweeps the stellar matter and the reverse shock which decelerates the jet matter .",
    "both shocked matter are divided by the contact discontinuity",
    ". then the velocity of the jet head can be calculated from the pressure balance at the contact discontinuity as @xmath78 where , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 represent the mass density , specific enthalpy , and pressure measured in the fluid rest frame , respectively , and @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the velocity normalized by the speed of light @xmath84 and the lorentz factor , respectively .",
    "the subscripts `` h '' , `` j '' , and `` a '' indicate that the quantity is measured in the rest frame of the jet head , the jet , and the ambient stellar medium , respectively .",
    "since the stellar medium is composed of the non - relativistic matter , we can neglect its pressure against the rest mass energy density , i.e. , @xmath85 , and this also leads to @xmath86 . in the left hand side of equation ( [ jet head ] ) , we can also neglect the jet pressure , since the jet is ultra - relativistic ( @xmath87 and @xmath88 ) .    using the above approximations ,",
    "the velocity of the jet head is given by @xmath89 where @xmath90 is a parameter which determines the jet dynamics .",
    "using the collimation - corrected jet luminosity given by @xmath91 @xmath92 is given by @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the cross section of the jet head .",
    "thus , @xmath92 is the ratio of the luminosity of the jet to that of the ambient stellar medium rest energy flux . here",
    ", we assume that the opening angle of the jet is constant with @xmath95 .",
    "this is the typical value obtained from the afterglow observations of lgrbs  @xcite .",
    "then the cross section can be given by @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the radius of the jet head .",
    "as long as the velocity of the jet head is non - relativistic  ( @xmath98 ) , the shocked jet head can expand sideways to form a cocoon structure surrounding the jet .",
    "since the temperature of the cocoon is high , it is radiation - pressure - dominated .",
    "as long as the sound crossing time in the cocoon is shorter than the dynamical time of the jet head , we can neglect the inner structure of the cocoon and assume that the cocoon is uniform .",
    "hereafter , we consider the one - zone model for the lateral expansion of the cocoon .",
    "the cocoon is overpressured with respect to the ambient stellar medium so that it expands laterally .",
    "by considering pressure balance at the surface of the cocoon , the lateral expansion velocity of the cocoon is calculated by @xcite @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the pressure in the cocoon and @xmath101 is the mean density of the progenitor star within the radius @xmath102 .    since the cocoon matter is radiation - pressure - dominated , the pressure is given by @xmath103 , where @xmath104 and @xmath105 represent the total energy and volume in the cocoon , respectively . because the cocoon energy is supplied from the jet head , it is given by @xmath106 where @xmath107 indicates the fraction of the jet luminosity streaming into the cocoon . throughout the paper , we set @xmath108 , since the velocity of the jet head is non - relativistic for most of the time within the progenitor envelope . in equation ( [ cocoon energy ] ) , the upper limit of the integral indicates that at @xmath67 , the jet head receives the luminosity which is produced at @xmath109 at the central engine . for the cocoon volume , we assume that the cocoon has a conical shape with the height of @xmath110 and the base radius of @xmath111 , so that it is given by @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the lateral distance of the cocoon surface from the jet axis given by @xmath114 .    substituting equations ( [ jet luminosity ] ) and ( [ jet parameter ] ) and the definition of @xmath94 into equation ( [ jet head velocity ] ) , the jet head velocity is given by @xmath115^{-1}. \\label{jet head velocity2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] substituting equations ( [ cocoon energy ] ) and ( [ cocoon volume ] ) into ( [ cocoon velocity ] ) , the lateral expansion velocity of the cocoon is given by @xmath116^{1/2}. \\label{cocoon velocity2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "and the cocoon surface @xmath117 , respectively . for the 1e5 model and the 1e4 model ,",
    "the jet head velocity is always larger than that of the cocoon edge so that the supermassive collapsar jet can break out the envelope . for @xmath118 and @xmath119 ,",
    "the jet head is accelerated drastically in the 1e5 and 1e4 models , respectively , because the envelope density decreases more steeply than @xmath120 . on the other hand , in the rsg",
    ", the jet head velocity is overtaken by that of the cocoon at @xmath121s . ]    in figure [ velocity evolution image ] , we show the time evolution of the velocities of the jet head and the lateral expansion of the cocoon surface with solid and dashed curves , respectively .",
    "each color corresponds to the 1e5 model ( red ) , the 1e4 model ( blue ) , and the rsg model ( green ) , respectively .",
    "they are calculated from equations ( [ jet head velocity2 ] ) and ( [ cocoon velocity2 ] ) .",
    "the horizontal axis shows the time from jet formation : @xmath122 . the vertical axis shows the velocity divided by the speed of light .",
    "we can see that for the models 1e4 and 1e5 , the velocity of the jet head is always larger than that of the cocoon surface . on the other hand , for the rsg model",
    ", the velocity of the cocoon exceeds that of the jet head at @xmath123 s. in the latter case , the radius of the jet head is comparable to the lateral size of the cocoon surface so that they can reach the stellar surface almost at the same time .",
    "this looks like a spherical explosion rather than a collimated explosion . on the other hand , in the former case ,",
    "the collimated jet breaks out the progenitor surface since the jet head reaches the surface much earlier than the cocoon .",
    "up to @xmath124 . note that the light curves decline steeply after the breakout , so that the observed duration @xmath12 is approximately equal to the breakout time . ]    in figure [ mass accretion rate image ] , we show the time evolution of the mass accretion rate onto the bh .",
    "the horizontal axis represents the time from jet formation .",
    "the red and blue curves correspond to the accretion rate obtained from the 1e5 model and the 1e4 model , respectively . while on each curve , dashed and solid regions correspond to the time before and after the jet breakout , respectively .",
    "we also show the accretion rate obtained from the wr model ( i.e. , lgrb ) with the gray curve as a reference .",
    "we can see that supermassive collapsar jets can lead to ulgrbs with the duration of @xmath125 , owing to the accretion of the massive envelope .",
    "while the sms models have as large radii as present - day rsgs , we find that the relativistic jet can break out the progenitor envelope successfully .",
    "this can be attributed to the difference in the slope of the density profile . at the outer envelope of a polytropic star with the polytropic index @xmath126 ,",
    "the density profile can be approximated as @xmath127  @xcite .",
    "since smss have radiation - pressure - dominated convective envelopes , the index can be approximated as @xmath128 @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , rsgs have gas - pressure - dominated convective envelopes so that the index is @xmath129 .",
    "thus , the sms models have steeper density profiles than the rsg models .",
    "when the velocity of the jet head is non - relativistic , @xmath92 is less than unity , so that the velocity can be approximately evaluated as @xmath130 furthermore , by using that @xmath33 is approximated as @xmath131 in the density profile of @xmath132 @xcite , and that @xmath102 is evaluated roughly as @xmath133 , we obtain @xmath134 from equation ( [ jet head velocity3 ] ) .",
    "therefore the jet head is accelerated in the outer region of the sms envelopes where the density profile decreases more steeply than @xmath120 . on the other hand ,",
    "the jet head is decelerated in the rsg envelopes . from figure",
    "[ velocity evolution image ] , we can see that the jet heads are accelerated drastically at @xmath135 and @xmath136 for the 1e5 and 1e4 models , respectively , when the jet heads enter the regions where the envelope density decreases more steeply than @xmath120 . on the other hand , for rsgs , the velocity of the jet head is decelerated in the envelope so that it takes much longer time to break out the envelope . in this case , the lateral size of the cocoon becomes comparable to the radius of the jet head .",
    "this is a spherical explosion but not a collimated grb .",
    "thus , rsgs can not be the progenitor of lgrbs as shown by  @xcite .",
    "it is possible that a disk wind flows out isotropically from the accretion disk and changes the envelope structure . in this case , the disk wind and the deformed envelope may affect the jet propagation . unless the wind velocity @xmath137 is larger than the jet head and cocoon velocity , however , this effect can be ignored .",
    "the wind velocity is evaluated from the wind energy as @xmath138 , where @xmath139 is the mass of the wind component .",
    "the wind energy is also given by @xmath140 , where @xmath141 is the efficiency parameter , as defined for the jet luminosity in equation ( [ jet luminosity ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , the cocoon velocity is evaluated by @xmath142 . from these equations , we obtain the ratio of the cocoon velocity to the wind velocity as @xmath143 . in our work ,",
    "the jet efficiency parameter is @xmath144 .",
    "as the wind flows out isotropically while the cocoon expands around the jet , their masses are related as @xmath145 , where @xmath146 is the jet opening angle .",
    "then , we have @xmath147 .",
    "thus , when the disk wind flows out very efficiently ( @xmath148 ) , we should consider the effect of the isotropic wind outflow on the envelope structure and the jet propagation .",
    "the recent numerical simulations of super - eddington accretion disks suggest the value of @xmath149 @xcite , although this value includes the efficiency from the accretion energy to the radiation and magnetic energy . ] , which yields @xmath150 .",
    "it should be noted that the accretion rates in their simulations are @xmath151 , while in our situation , the mass accretion rates amount to @xmath152 .",
    "we need numerical calculations in order to study the disk wind in our case .",
    "once the relativistic jet breaks out the progenitor s envelope , it can contribute to the prompt high - energy emission , like lgrbs .",
    "here , we evaluate the observational signatures and the detectability of the prompt emission from the supermassive collapsar jets .",
    "since the emission mechanisms of the prompt emission of grbs are still under debates , however , following @xcite , we evaluate them by applying simple empirical relations to supermassive collapsar jets .",
    "first of all , we describe our model for the prompt emission .",
    "we assume that once the jet breaks out the surface at @xmath153 , the relativistic jet can contribute to the gamma - ray emission by using a fraction @xmath154 of its energy .",
    "thus , the collimation - corrected gamma - ray luminosity is given by @xmath155 .",
    "we also assume that the high energy emission lasts until all the matter in the envelope has accreted onto the central bh at @xmath156 .",
    "hence , the duration of the prompt emission can be evaluated by @xmath157 .",

    "this is because the @xmath164-@xmath160 correlation leads to @xmath212 , which is out of the bat energy range .",
    "nonetheless , we can see that the burst can be detectable up to @xmath206 for @xmath208 in the 1e5 model .",
    "on the other hand , in the 1e4 model , longer integration times  ( @xmath213 ) are needed to detect the burst at such a high redshift of 20 .    , but the flux is calculated assuming that the @xmath164-@xmath160 correlation holds . ]",
    "thus , we conclude that the prompt emission from supermassive collapsar jets can be detectable as ulgrbs up to @xmath214 even with the current detectors like bat .",
    "if the high mass accretion rate of @xmath215-@xmath216 continues , the sms mass will eventually reach a few times @xmath217 and the gr instability sets in to lead the formation of a bh and accretion disk system .",
    "for the highest mass accretion rate of @xmath218",
    ". eventually , it exhausts the nuclear fuel in @xmath219 and collapses to form the central bh .",
    "actually , the calculation of @xcite shows that the hydrogen burning occurs in the core .",
    "] such a high mass accretion rate onto protostars is obtained if the temperature is high as shown in equation ( [ eq : m_acc ] ) and second paragraph of section [ progenitor model ] .",
    "recently , @xcite calculated the evolution of a sms under such a high mass accretion rate @xmath40-@xmath216 from the protostar phase to the final mass of @xmath220 .",
    "they found that the sms evolves with a very large envelope of @xmath221 . under the rapid mass accretion",
    ", the stellar envelope has a large opacity dominated by @xmath222 ions , and absorbs heat released by the contraction of the stellar inner region .",
    "then , the stellar envelope expands as the protostar accretes matter @xcite .",
    "@xcite , however , were not able to compute the sms evolution beyond @xmath43 , because their stellar evolution code is suffered from the numerical difficulties .",
    "the reason is not clear . if the accretion is stopped before the gr instability sets in , the final pre - collapse model is similar to the 1e5 model so that the ulgrb of the sms is expected as discussed in the previous section .",
    "if the accretion continues , the sms will enter the gr instability region .",
    "in such a case , we can assume that the sms has similar density profile obtained by @xcite when it begins to collapse through the gr instability .",
    "the structure of the sms envelope would not change so much as long as the high mass accretion rate is kept until the sms obtains the critical mass .",
    "therefore , our assumption may be justified for the envelope , which is important for the propagation of jet heads as we saw in the previous section .    in figure  [ density profile2 image ] , we show the density profile of the accreting sms when its mass reaches @xmath220 by using the magenta curve . while in @xcite ,",
    "the density profile is given as a function of the mass coordinate @xmath55 ( in fig .",
    "3 of their paper ) , we show it as a function of radius @xmath54 by integrating the mass conservation equation @xmath223 .",
    "as shown in figure 6 , the accreting sms is about @xmath25 times larger than a rsg .",
    "hence one may expect that the jet can not break out the surface of the star as rsgs .",
    "however , we find this progenitor also has a steep density profile in the radiation - pressure - dominated envelope . therefore , according to the argument in section [ breakout ] , we expect that a relativistic jet is accelerated to break out the surface of the progenitor star .",
    "we calculate the jet propagation in the same way described in section [ grb associated with the smss ] , and find that the jet actually breaks out the envelope .",
    "thus , we expect that even if the sms collapses in the accreting protostar phase , it can produce an energetic explosion .",
    "we also calculate light curves of the prompt emission , assuming that the @xmath164-@xmath161 and the @xmath164-@xmath160 correlations hold . in figures [ light curve bat yonetoku2 image ] and [ light curve bat amati2 image ]",
    ", we show the light curves .",
    "ulgrbs from accreting smss are dimmer than the grbs from the 1e5 model .",
    "this is because the accreting smss are larger than smss of the 1e5 model .",
    "it takes more time for a jet to break out the larger envelope .",
    "thus , when the jet breaks out the envelope , the accretion rate onto the central bh is decreased . the observation time to detect ulgrbs from accreting",
    "smss is longer than that of the non - accreting smss in figures [ light curve bat yonetoku image ] and [ light curve bat amati image ] .",
    "( _ magenta curve _ ) .",
    "this progenitor also has the steep density profile of the envelope ( with slope of @xmath224 ) , where a relativistic jet is not decelerated .",
    "note that this progenitor is not yet in the pre - collpase phase , but in the accreting protostar phase .",
    "we can expect that when the gr instability sets in , however , the pre - collapse progenitor has the similar density profile especially in the envelope as long as the high mass accretion rate is kept .",
    "with the _ red _ and _ green curves _ , we also show the density profiles of the 1e5 model and rsg , respectively , for references as in figure  [ density profile image ] . ]    , but the flux is calculated from the accreting supermassive collapsar ( _ magenta curves _ ) assuming that the @xmath164-@xmath161 correlation holds .",
    "we also show the light curves of the 1e5 model for references . ]    , but the flux is calculated assuming that the @xmath164-@xmath160 correlation holds . ]",
    "we briefly discuss the detection rate of the ulgrbs from supermassive collapsars .",
    "for a given observation time @xmath225 , the cumulative number of ulgrbs @xmath226 which have redshifts less than @xmath17 can be calculated from @xmath227 where @xmath228 is the intrinsic event rate of ulgrbs and @xmath229 is the comoving distance to the redshift @xmath17 .",
    "while the intrinsic event rate @xmath228 is still uncertain , we can roughly estimate it by using the formation rate of smss or dcbhs , which are theoretically studied in the previous studies  @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied the formation rate of dcbhs in the early universe .",
    "they found that dcbhs can be formed from @xmath206 to @xmath230  ( corresponding to @xmath231 myr ) , and that the comoving mass density of dcbhs can be @xmath232 . since they assumed the typical mass of a dcbh as @xmath233 , the comoving number density of dcbhs can be evaluated as @xmath234 .",
    "then , we can obtain the intrinsic rate of ulgrbs as @xmath235 .",
    "it should be noted that in this rough estimate , we assume that all the smss collapse to dcbhs after they contribute to ulgrbs .",
    "this rate may be optimistic .    substituting the above value into equation ( [ event rate ] ) ,",
    "the event rate of the ulgrbs on the whole sky can be obtained as @xmath236 the detection rate of the ulgrbs is reduced by the beaming factor , @xmath237 , since the off - axis bursts are not detectable . by multiplying the beaming factor to equation ( [ event rate2 ] ) ,",
    "the detection rate is about one event per year .",
    "the emission from an expanding cocoon fireball might play a key role to raise the detection rate of the event .",
    "after the jet breakout , the cocoon also breaks out the star and evolves like a non - relativistic fireball outside the star  @xcite .",
    "the cocoon emission will be isotropic and free from the beaming effect .",
    "various feedback effects are expected from the supermassive collapsars , since they release a huge amount of energy .",
    "in fact , the total energy of the cocoon fireball discussed above could be as large as @xmath238-@xmath10 , which can be calculated from equation , @xmath239 .",
    "then , the emission from the cocoon fireball might be observed as the most energetic supernova explosions in the universe . moreover , such a violent explosion could disrupt the host halo , and hinder the remnant massive bhs from growing up to smbhs within @xmath240 @xmath241gyr after the bh formation .",
    "in addition , if heavy elements are produced in the jet head and cocoon , they could contribute to the chemical enrichment of the host halo",
    ". the metal polluted gas will induce the formation of second generation of stars .",
    "the line features in the cocoon emission could also tell us the abundance pattern of the nucleosynthesis to confirm the sms origin , although the line may be broad due to the high expansion velocity .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite considered a very energetic supernova explosion of @xmath242 in the first galaxies , and calculated the dynamical evolution of the blast wave within the host .",
    "they found that whereas the blast wave engulfs the entire galaxy , most of its energy is radiated away via efficient cooling processes , so that the swept up matters  ( @xmath243 ) could recollapse to the host @xmath244 after the explosion .",
    "thus , such an energetic explosion might not hinder the remnant massive bh from becoming supermassive within @xmath240 1gyr after its formation .",
    "on the other hand , the momentum conservation suggests that the host galaxy is expelled if the explosion energy is larger than @xmath245 erg .",
    "thus more detailed calculations are worth while .    even after contributing to the prompt emission",
    ", the relativistic jet has a huge amount of kinetic energy @xmath246 .",
    "this can leads to bright afterglow emissions at various wavelengths  @xcite .",
    "the detection of such afterglow emissions could provide us rich information about the surrounding environments of smss such as the density and the chemical composition of the circumstellar medium .",
    "we investigated whether in the early universe smss are able to produce grbs according to the collapsar scenario . since smss have radii at least as large as rsgs , naively it would seem difficult for a relativistic to jet reach the surface before the jet engine dies . actually calculating the jet propagation in smss , however , we find that jets are able to break out the thick envelope of smss .",
    "this is because the envelope of smss is dominated by radiation pressure and has a steeper density gradient than rsgs in which the gas pressure dominates .",
    "our conclusion is that smss forming in protogalaxies can produce violent grbs .",
    "based on empirical rules , we find that the collapse of smss may be observed as ulgrbs with a duration of @xmath247-@xmath5 by the current detectors like bat . our optimistic estimates indicate rates of detectable grbs of about one event per year . comparing with observations",
    ", we can impose some conditions on the intrinsic event rate which is related to the sms or dcbh formation rate .",
    "since grbs are collimated bursts , beaming reduces the rate of detectable events .",
    "therefore , it is important to consider the isotropic emission accompanying grbs , e.g. , the cocoon fireball emissions .",
    "studying the detectability of cocoon fireball emission is an interesting future work .",
    "the sms grbs are very energetic explosions releasing more than @xmath248-@xmath10 and sweep up or blow off the matter in protogalaxies . as a result ,",
    "grbs strongly influence the mass accretion onto the newborn seed bhs .",
    "this negative feedback needs to be taken into account when studying the growth of remnant bhs .",
