    "in this contribution we discuss signals for right - handed currents in rare hadronic @xmath0 decays .",
    "signals in radiative @xmath0 decays are reviewed elsewhere in this report .",
    "implications of right - handed currents for @xmath8-violation phenomenology are addressed in @xmath9 symmetric models , and in the more general case of no left - right symmetry .",
    "we will see that it may be possible to distinguish between these scenarios at a high luminosity @xmath0 factory .",
    "remarkably , the existence of @xmath10 symmetry could be inferred even if it is broken at a scale many orders of magnitude larger than the weak scale , e.g. , @xmath11 , in parity symmetric models @xcite .",
    "an explicit supersymmetric realization is briefly described .",
    "a direct test for right - handed currents from polarization measurements in @xmath0 decays to light vector meson pairs is also discussed  @xcite . in the event that non - standard model @xmath8-violation is confirmed , e.g. , in the @xmath12 time - dependent @xmath8 asymmetry , an important question will be whether it arises via new physics contributions to the four - quark operators , the @xmath13 dipole operators , or both .",
    "we will see that this question can be addressed by comparing @xmath8 asymmetries in the different transversity final states in pure penguin @xmath5 decays , e.g. , @xmath14 .",
    "the underlying reason is large suppression of the _ transverse _ dipole operator matrix elements .",
    "it is well known that it is difficult to obtain new @xmath15 @xmath8 violation effects at the _ loop - level _ from the _ dimension - six _ four - quark operators .",
    "thus , this information could help discriminate between scenarios in which new physics effects are induced via loops versus at tree - level .",
    "extensions of the standard model often include new @xmath16 right - handed currents .",
    "these are conventionally associated with opposite chirality effective operators @xmath17 which are related to the standard model operators @xmath18 by parity transformations ,    * qcd penguin operators @xmath19 * chromo / electromagnetic dipole operators @xmath20 * electroweak penguin operators @xmath21    examples of new physics which could give rise to right - handed currents include supersymmetric loops which contribute to the qcd penguin or chromomagnetic dipole operators .",
    "these are discussed in detail elsewhere in this report .",
    "figure [ fig : susyloops ] illustrates the well known squark - gluino loops in the squark mass - insertion approximation . for example , the down - squark mass - insertion @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) would contribute to @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) , whereas @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) would contribute to @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "right - handed currents could also arise at tree - level via new contributions to the qcd or electroweak penguin operators , e.g. , due to flavor - changing @xmath30 couplings , @xmath31-parity violating couplings , or color - octet exchange .",
    "we exploit the large collection of _ pure - penguin _ @xmath32 decay modes , which in the standard model have    * null decay rate @xmath8-asymmetries , @xmath33 , or * null deviations of the time - dependent @xmath8-asymmetry coefficient @xmath34 from @xmath35 in decays to @xmath8-eigenstates , @xmath36 , or * null triple - product @xmath8-asymmetries @xmath37 in @xmath5 decays .",
    "we recall that there are three helicity amplitudes @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) in @xmath40 decays : @xmath41 , in which both vectors are longitudinaly polarized ; @xmath42 , in which both vectors have negative helicity ; and @xmath43 , in which both vectors have positive helicity . in the transversity basis  @xcite ,",
    "the amplitudes are given by , @xmath44 in @xmath0 decays , @xmath45 .",
    "the cp - violating triple - products  @xcite ( related to @xmath46 ) are then given by @xmath47 the triple - products are discussed in detail in the contribution of a.  datta .",
    "a partial list of null standard model @xmath8 asymmetries in pure - penguin decays is given below @xcite ,    * @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , ... * @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , ... * @xmath61 , @xmath62 , ...    in addition , there are several modes which are penguin - dominated and are predicted to have approximately null or small standard model asymmetries , e.g. , @xmath63 ( @xmath64 subtracted )  @xcite , @xmath65  @xcite , and @xmath66 .",
    "under parity , the effective operators transform as @xmath67 .",
    "the new physics amplitudes , for final states @xmath68 with parity @xmath69 , therefore satisfy @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the new wilson coefficient contributions to the ith pair of standard model and opposite chirality operators  @xcite .",
    "it follows that for decays to @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 final states , where @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 are scalar , pseudoscalar , and vector mesons , respectively , the new physics amplitudes satisfy @xmath79 @xmath80 in @xmath5 decays the @xmath81 transversity and @xmath82 transversity final states are @xmath77-odd and @xmath77-even , respectively , yielding @xmath83 similarly , replacing one of the vector mesons with an axial - vector meson gives @xmath84 it is useful to classify the null and approximately null standard model @xmath8 asymmetries listed above according to whether the final state is @xmath77-odd or @xmath77-even ,    * p - even : @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath85 , @xmath57 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath88 , ... * p - odd : @xmath89 , @xmath56 , @xmath51 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , ... * modes with small standard model asymmetries : @xmath63 ( approximately @xmath77-even ) , @xmath65 ( p - even ) , and @xmath66 ( p - odd ) .",
    "we are now ready to discuss implications for @xmath8 violation phenomenology in the two classes of models mentioned earlier .      in the limit in which new physics is parity symmetric at the weak scale",
    "the relation @xmath93 would hold . in light of ( [ anpparity ] ) this would imply @xcite    * preservation of null @xmath8 asymmetry predictions in _ p - even _ final states . similarly , the @xmath94 constraint would be trivially satisfied .",
    "* possibly large departures from null @xmath8 asymmetries in _",
    "p - odd _ final states .",
    "for example , no deviations in @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 could be accompanied by significant deviations in @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 . both of the triple - products @xmath103 and @xmath104 in ( [ at ] ) could be affected through a modification of @xmath105 .",
    "however , there would be no novel @xmath8 asymmetry in the interference of the parallel and longitudinal polarizations .",
    "equivalently , the measurable quantities @xmath106 and @xmath107 defined below @xmath108 would be equal .",
    "parity - symmetric new physics requires @xmath109 symmetry at high energies .",
    "thus , exact weak scale parity can not be realized due to renormalization group effects below the @xmath3 breaking scale , @xmath110 .",
    "potentially , the largest source of parity violation is the difference between the top and bottom quark yukawa couplings . in particular ,",
    "when @xmath111 the charged higgs yukawa couplings break parity .",
    "two scenarios for the yukawa couplings naturally present themselves :    * moderate @xmath112 , or @xmath113 * maximal - parity : @xmath114 or @xmath115 small corrections to the limit of equal up and down yukawa matrices are required in order to generate the observed ckm quark mixings and light quark masses .",
    "@xmath116 therefore sets the scale for minimal parity violation in the yukawa sector .    a large hierarchy between the @xmath3 breaking scale and the weak scale can be realized naturally in supersymmetric left - right symmetric models .",
    "these models contain two higgs bidoublet superfields @xmath117 ( or four @xmath118 doublets ) . via the ` doublet - doublet splitting ' mechanism @xcite two linear combinations of the higgs doublets",
    "acquire masses of order @xmath110 , leaving the two light higgs doublets of the mssm .",
    "realization of approximately parity symmetric contributions to the _ dipole _",
    "operators favors explicit @xmath8 violation .",
    "spontaneous @xmath8 violation could lead to complex @xmath77-violating vacuum expectation values which would feed into new loop contributions to the operators . for example , @xmath77 invariance above the weak scale would imply @xmath119 where @xmath120 breaks @xmath118 and @xmath121 is in general complex due to explicit @xmath8 violating phases .",
    "( @xmath122 is an order tev new physics scale , e.g. , the squark or gluino masses in figure 1 ) .",
    "thus , @xmath123 would have to be real to good approximation in order to obtain @xmath124 .",
    "note that this also requires real gaugino masses ; otherwise rge effects would induce a complex higgs bilinear @xmath0 term in the scalar potential , thus leading to complex @xmath120 .",
    "ordinary parity symmetry insures real @xmath125 and @xmath126 gaugino masses .",
    "real @xmath127 gaugino masses naturally follow from the @xmath128 generalization of parity @xcite .",
    "all the vevs entering new _ four - quark _ operator loops can , in principle , be parity neutral . therefore , real vevs are less crucial for obtaining approximately parity - symmetric four - quark operator contributions .",
    "we have carried out a two - loop rge analysis for down squark - gluino loop contributions to the dipole operators .",
    "choosing parity symmetric boundary conditions at @xmath110 , taking @xmath4 , and running to the weak scale we obtain    * moderate @xmath112 , e.g. , @xmath129 : @xmath130 } { { \\rm re } [ c^{\\rm np}_{8g}(m_{w } ) + \\tilde{c}^{\\rm np}_{8g}(m_{w } ) ] } \\le 10\\% } , \\qquad { \\tiny   \\frac{{\\rm im}[c_{8g}^{\\rm np}(m_{w } ) - \\tilde{c}^{\\rm np}_{8g}(m_{w } ) ] } { { \\rm i m } [ c^{\\rm np}_{8g}(m_{w } ) + \\tilde{c}^{\\rm np}_{8g}(m_{w } ) ] } \\le 10\\% } \\ ] ] * maximal parity , @xmath131 @xmath132 } { { \\rm i m } [ c^{\\rm np}_{8g}(m_{w } ) + \\tilde{c}^{\\rm np}_{8g}(m_{w } ) ] } = o ( 1\\% ) } \\ ] ]    the above quantities give a measure of parity violation in the weak scale wilson coefficients .",
    "thus , we see that for @xmath133 , new @xmath8 violating contributions to the low energy lagrangian could respect parity to @xmath134 .",
    "precision @xmath8 violation measurements in @xmath0 decays which respect ( violate ) null sm predictions in @xmath77-even ( @xmath77-odd ) final states would therefore provide evidence for @xmath9 symmetry , even if @xmath3 is broken at the gut scale .",
    "similar results are obtained for survival of parity in the four - quark operators @xcite .",
    "any discussion of dipole operator phenomenology must consider the upper bound on the strange quark chromo - electric dipole moment @xmath136 , obtained from the upper bound on the @xmath135hg mercury edm @xcite .",
    "correlations between @xmath136 and new @xmath8 violating contributions to @xmath137 , @xmath138 are most easily seen by writing the dipole operator effective hamiltonian in the weak interaction basis , @xmath139 @xmath140 and @xmath141 ( @xmath142 ) are the left - handed and right - handed down quark weak interaction eigenstates , respectively .",
    "the mass eigenstates can be written as @xmath143 , where @xmath144 stands for the @xmath145 quarks , respectively , and @xmath146 .",
    "the bound on @xmath136 is @xmath147 , with large theoretical uncertainty , where @xmath148 is the flavor diagonal strange quark dipole operator coefficient ( in the mass eigentate basis ) .",
    "it is given as @xmath149 similarly , the @xmath13 wilson coefficients are given as @xmath150 if significant contributions to the ckm matrix elements are generated in the down quark sector , then @xmath151 , @xmath152 , and @xmath153 . in the absence of special flavor symmetries , similar magnitudes would be expected for the corresponding right - handed quark mixing coefficients , @xmath154 .",
    "generically , we therefore expect @xmath155 .",
    "@xmath156 would correspond to @xmath157\\sim 1 $ ] .",
    "thus , @xmath15 @xmath8 violating effects generically correspond to a value for @xmath136 which is a factor of 100 too large . one way to evade this bound is by invoking some mechanism , e.g. , flavor symmetries , for generating the large hierarchies @xmath158 and @xmath159 . an elegant alternative is provided by parity symmetry @xcite . it is well known that edm s must vanish in the parity symmetric limit , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "for example , in ( [ css ] ) exact parity would imply @xmath160 , @xmath161 and real @xmath162 , thus yielding a real coefficient , @xmath148 .",
    "an rge analysis along the lines discussed above is required in order to determine the extent to which this can be realized at low energies .",
    "we find that in both the maximal parity scenario ( @xmath131 ) and in moderate @xmath112 scenarios it is possible to obtain @xmath156 and at the same time satisfy the bound on @xmath136 if @xmath163 @xcite .      in the parity - symmetric scenario ,",
    "an unambiguous theoretical interpretation of the pattern of @xmath8 violation is possible because null predictions are maintained for the @xmath77-even final states .",
    "however , if new contributions to the @xmath18 and @xmath17 operators are unrelated , then @xmath8 asymmetries in the @xmath77-odd and @xmath77-even null standard model modes could differ significantly both _ from each other , and from the null predictions_. this is due to the opposite relative sign between the left - handed and right - handed new physics amplitudes for @xmath77-odd and @xmath77-even final states in eqs .",
    "( [ anpparity]) ( [ anpav ] ) .",
    "for example , @xmath56 and @xmath57 could be affected differently in the mssm @xcite .",
    "an interesting illustration would be provided by models with @xmath164 contributions to the @xmath165 , and negligible new contributions to the @xmath18 .",
    "this could happen , for example , in supersymmetric models with large ( negligible ) @xmath166 squark mixing @xcite@xcite , or in models in which @xmath31-parity violation induces opposite chirality four - quark operators at the tree - level @xcite .",
    "unrelated right - handed currents could also arise in warped extra dimension models with bulk left - right symmetry @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , @xmath8 asymmetry predictions have large theoretical uncertainties due to @xmath167 power corrections , especially from the qcd penguin annihilation amplitudes .",
    "they are therefore difficult to interpret .",
    "an illustration is provided in figure [ fig : cpcomparison ] , which compares predictions for @xmath168 and @xmath169 arising from new contributions to @xmath24 and @xmath170 in qcd factorization @xcite .",
    "for @xmath99 we take @xmath171 . for @xmath172 two corresponding cases",
    "are considered : ( a ) a purely left - handed current , @xmath173 , @xmath174 , ( b ) a purely right - handed current , @xmath175 , @xmath176 .",
    "the scatter plots scan over the input parameter ranges given in @xcite ( with the exception of the gegenbauer moments of the light meson light - cone distribution amplitudes and @xmath177 , which have been set to their default values ) .",
    "in addition , the branching ratios are required to lie within their 90% c.l .",
    "intervals .",
    "clearly , very different values for the two @xmath8 asymmetries can be realized if the new physics only appears in @xmath24 .",
    "for example , for @xmath178 , it is possible to obtain @xmath179 and @xmath180 .",
    "the theoretical uncertainty in @xmath95 is larger than for @xmath181 .",
    "we therefore expect that even larger differences are possible between @xmath95 and @xmath56 , for purely left - handed currents .",
    "however , figure [ fig : cpcomparison ] suggests that @xmath182 and @xmath183 ( @xmath184 is realized at @xmath185 ) could be a signal for right - handed currents @xcite .",
    "more theoretical studies are needed in order to determine if this is indeed the case .",
    "in particular , a more thorough analysis of uncertainties due to @xmath186 effects needs to be undertaken .",
    "for example , power corrections to the dipole operator matrix elements remain to be included .",
    "furthermore , the impact on @xmath187 of new physics in all of the ` left - handed ' four - quark operators needs to be thoroughly studied .",
    "a discussion of polarization in @xmath5 decays has been presented in @xcite in the framework of qcd factorization . here",
    "we summarize some of the results . to begin with we note that the polarization should be sensitive to the @xmath188 structure of the standard model , due to the power suppression associated with the ` helicity - flip ' of a collinear quark .",
    "for example , in the standard model the factorizable graphs for @xmath189 are due to transition operators with chirality structures @xmath190 , see figure [ fig : factorizable ] . in the helicity amplitude",
    "@xmath191 a collinear @xmath192 or @xmath193 quark with positive helicity ends up in the negatively polarized @xmath64 , whereas in @xmath194 a second quark ",
    "helicity - flip is required in the form factor transition .",
    "collinear quark helicity flips require transverse momentum , @xmath195 , implying a suppression of @xmath196 per flip . in the case of new right - handed currents , e.g. , @xmath197 ,",
    "the helicity amplitude hierarchy would be inverted , with @xmath194 and @xmath198 requiring one and two helicity - flips , respectively .    in naive factorization",
    "the @xmath199 helicity amplitudes , supplemented by the large energy form factor relations @xcite , satisfy @xmath200 @xmath201 and @xmath202 are the @xmath203 form factors in the large energy limit @xcite . both scale as @xmath204 in the heavy quark limit , implying @xmath205 .",
    "@xmath206 parametrizes form factor helicity suppression .",
    "it is given by @xmath207 where @xmath208 and @xmath78 are the axial - vector and vector current form factors , respectively .",
    "the large energy relations imply that @xmath209 vanishes at leading power , reflecting the fact that helicity suppression is @xmath210 .",
    "thus , @xmath211 .",
    "light - cone qcd sum rules @xcite , and lattice form factor determinations scaled to low @xmath212 using the sum rule approach @xcite , give @xmath213 ; qcd sum rules give @xmath214 @xcite ; and the bsw model gives @xmath215 @xcite .",
    "the polarization fractions in the transversity basis ( [ transversity ] ) therefore satisfy @xmath216 in naive factorization , where the subscript @xmath217 refers to longitudinal polarization , @xmath218 , and @xmath219 .",
    "the measured longitudinal fractions for @xmath220 are close to 1 @xcite .",
    "this is not the case for @xmath221 for which full angular analyses yield @xmath222 naively averaging the belle and babar measurements ( without taking correlations into account ) yields @xmath223 .",
    "we must go beyond naive factorization in order to determine if the small value of @xmath224 could simply be due to the dominance of qcd penguin operators in @xmath225 decays , rather than new physics .",
    "in particular , it is necessary to determine if the power counting in ( [ smpred ] ) is preserved by non - factorizable graphs , i.e. , penguin contractions , vertex corrections , spectator interactions , annihilation graphs , and graphs involving higher fock - state gluons .",
    "this question can be addressed in qcd factorization @xcite .    in qcd factorization",
    "exclusive two - body decay amplitudes are given in terms of convolutions of hard scattering kernels with meson light - cone distribution amplitudes @xcite@xcite . at leading power",
    "this leads to factorization of short and long - distance physics .",
    "this separation breaks down at sub - leading powers with the appearance of logarithmic infrared divergences , e.g. , @xmath226 , where @xmath227 is the light - cone quark momentum fraction in a final state meson , and @xmath228 is a physical infrared cutoff .",
    "nevertheless , the power - counting for all amplitudes can be obtained . the extent to which it holds numerically",
    "can be determined by assigning large uncertainties to the logarithmic divergences .",
    "fortunately , certain polarization observables are less sensitive to this uncertainty , particularly after experimental constraints , e.g. , total rate or total transverse rate , are imposed .",
    "examples of logarithmically divergent hard spectator interaction and qcd penguin annihilation graphs are shown in figure [ fig : annihilation ] , with the quark helicities indicated .",
    "the power counting for the helicity amplitudes of the annihilation graph , including logarithmic divergences , is @xmath229 the logarithmic divergences are associated with the limit in which both the @xmath192 and @xmath193 quarks originating from the gluon are soft .",
    "the annihilation topology implies an overall factor of @xmath230 .",
    "each remaining factor of @xmath231 is associated with a quark helicity flip .",
    "in fact , adding up all of the helicity amplitude contributions in qcd factorization _ formally _ preserves the naive factorization power counting in ( [ smpred ] ) @xcite .",
    "recently , the first relation in ( [ smpred ] ) has been confirmed in the soft collinear effective theory @xcite .",
    "however , as we will see below , it need not hold numerically because of qcd penguin annihilation .",
    "the numerical inputs are given in @xcite .",
    "the logaritmic divergences are modeled as in @xcite .",
    "for example , in the annihilation amplitudes the quantities @xmath232 are introduced as @xmath233 this parametrization reflects the physical @xmath234 cutoff , and allows for large strong phases @xmath235 $ ] from soft rescattering .",
    "the quantities @xmath232 ( and the corresponding hard spectator interaction quantities @xmath236 ) are varied independently for unrelated convolution integrals .",
    "the predicted longitudinal polarization fractions @xmath237 and @xmath238 are close to unity , in agreement with observation @xcite and with naive power counting ( [ smpred ] ) .",
    "the theoretical uncertainties are small , particularly after imposing the branching ratio constraints , due to the absence of ( for @xmath239 ) or ckm suppression of ( for @xmath240 ) the qcd penguin amplitudes .    averaging the belle and babar @xmath241 measurements @xcite yields @xmath242 and @xmath243 , or @xmath244 and @xmath245 .",
    "@xmath246 and @xmath247 are the @xmath8-averaged longitudinal and total transverse branching ratios , respectively . in the absence of annihilation ,",
    "the predicted branching ratios are @xmath248 and @xmath249 , where the second ( first ) set of error bars is due to variations of @xmath236 ( all other inputs ) .",
    "however , the @xmath250 qcd penguin annihilation graph in figure [ fig : annihilation ] can play an important role in both @xmath251 and @xmath198 due to the appearance of a logarithmic divergence squared ( @xmath252 ) , the large wilson coefficient @xmath253 , and a @xmath254 rather than @xmath255 dependence .",
    "although formally @xmath256 , see ( [ a3fpowers ] ) , these contributions can be @xmath164 numerically .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig : phikstpolarization ] , where @xmath257 and @xmath258 are plotted versus the quantities @xmath259 and @xmath260 , respectively , for @xmath261 .",
    "@xmath259 and @xmath260 enter the parametrizations ( [ xa ] ) of the logarithmic divergences appearing in the longitudinal and negative helicity @xmath250 annihilation amplitudes , respectively .",
    "as @xmath262 increase from 0 to 1 , the corresponding annihilation amplitudes increase by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "the theoretical uncertainties on the rates are very large .",
    "furthermore , the largest input parameter uncertainties in @xmath246 and @xmath258 are a priori unrelated .",
    "thus , it is clear from figure [ fig : phikstpolarization ] that the qcd penguin annihilation amplitudes can account for the @xmath263 measurements .",
    "similarly , the babar measurement of @xmath264 @xcite can be accounted for .",
    "do the qcd penguin annihilation amplitudes also imply large transverse polarizations in @xmath265 decays ?",
    "the answer depends on the pattern of @xmath266 flavor symmetry violation in these amplitudes . for light mesons containing a single strange quark ,",
    "e.g. , @xmath267 , non - asymptotic effects shift the weighting of the meson distribution amplitudes towards larger strange quark momenta . as a result ,",
    "the suppression of @xmath268 popping relative to light quark popping in annihilation amplitudes can be @xmath164 , which is consistent with the order of magnitude hierarchy between the @xmath269 and @xmath270 rates  @xcite .",
    "( see @xcite for a discussion of other sources of @xmath271 violation ) . in the present case , this implies that the longitudinal polarizations should satisfy @xmath272 in the standard model @xcite .",
    "consequently , @xmath273 would suggest that @xmath274-spin violating new physics entering mainly in the @xmath275 channel is responsible for the small @xmath276 .",
    "one possibility would be right - handed vector currents ; they could interfere constructively ( destructively ) in @xmath277 ( @xmath278 ) transversity amplitudes , see ( [ anpvv ] ) .",
    "alternatively , a parity - symmetric scenario would only affect @xmath277 .",
    "a more exotic possibility would be tensor currents ; they would contribute to the longitudinal and transverse amplitudes at sub - leading and leading power , respectively , opposite to the vector currents .",
    "we should mention that our treatment of the charm ( and up ) quark loops in the penguin amplitudes follows the usual perturbative approach used in qcd factorization @xcite@xcite .",
    "the authors of @xcite believe that the region of phase space in which the charm quark pair has invariant mass @xmath279 , and is thus moving non - relativistically , should be separated out into a long - distance ` charming penguin ' amplitude @xcite .",
    "nrqcd arguments are invoked to claim that such contributions are @xmath280 , where @xmath281 , so that they could effectively be of leading power .",
    "furthermore , it is claimed that the transverse components may also be of leading power , thus potentially accounting for @xmath224 . however , a physical mechanism by which a collinear quark helicity - flip could arise in this case without power suppression remains to be clarified .",
    "arguments against a special treatment of this region of phase space @xcite are based on parton - hadron duality .",
    "it should be noted that in qcd factorization this region of @xmath212 contributes negligibly to the @xmath5 penguin amplitudes , particularly in the transverse components .",
    "more recently , the low value of @xmath224 has been addressed using a purely hadronic model for soft rescattering of intermediate two - body charm states , i.e. , @xmath282 @xcite .",
    "this approach has been criticized previously on the grounds that a `` purely hadronic language , suitable for kaon decays '' is not applicable to the case of @xmath0 decays , where the `` number of channels , and the energy release are large '' @xcite . in particular , many intermediate multi - body channels have been ignored which are predicted to lead to systematic amplitude cancelations in the heavy quark limit .",
    "does the naive factorization relation @xmath283 ( [ smpred ] ) survive in qcd factorization ?",
    "this ratio is very sensitive to the quantity @xmath284 defined in ( [ rperp ] ) . as @xmath206 increases",
    ", @xmath285 decreases .",
    "the range @xmath286 spanning existing model determinations @xcite@xcite is taken in @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : fperppar ] ( left ) the resulting predictions for @xmath287 and @xmath258 are studied simultaneaously for @xmath261 in the standard model .",
    "note that the theoretical uncertainty for @xmath287 is much smaller than for @xmath288 .",
    "evidently , the above relation still holds , particularly at larger values of @xmath258 where qcd penguin annihilation dominates both @xmath289 and @xmath290 .    a ratio for @xmath287 in excess of the standard model range , e.g. , @xmath291 if @xmath292 , would signal the presence of new right - handed currents .",
    "this is due to the inverted hierarchy between @xmath198 and @xmath194 for right - handed currents , and is reflected in the sign difference with which the wilson coefficients @xmath293 enter @xmath294 and @xmath295 . for illustration , new contributions to the qcd penguin operators are considered in figure [ fig : fperppar ] ( right ) . at the new physics matching scale @xmath296 , these can be parametrized as @xmath297 . for simplicity , we take @xmath298 and consider two cases : @xmath299 or new left - handed currents ( lower bands ) , and @xmath300 or new right - handed currents ( upper bands ) , corresponding to @xmath301 or @xmath302 , and @xmath303 or @xmath304 . clearly",
    ", moderately sized right - handed currents could increase @xmath285 well beyond the standard model range if @xmath305 . however , new left - handed currents would have little effect .",
    "the @xmath306 penguin contractions of the chromomagnetic dipole operator @xmath24 are illustrated in figure [ fig : q8 g ] .",
    "@xmath307 and @xmath308 are the qcd factorization coefficients of the transition operators @xmath309 and @xmath310 , respectively , where @xmath311 is summed over @xmath312 @xcite . only the contribution on the left ( @xmath307 ) to the longitudinal helicity amplitude",
    "@xmath251 is non - vanishing @xcite . in particular , the chromo- and electromagnetic dipole operators @xmath24 and @xmath313 _ do not contribute to the transverse penguin amplitudes _ at @xmath306 due to angular momentum conservation : the dipole tensor current couples to a transverse gluon , but a ` helicity - flip ' for @xmath311 or @xmath314 in figure [ fig : q8 g ] would require a longitudinal gluon coupling .",
    "formally , this result follows from wandura - wilczek type relations among the vector meson distribution amplitudes , and the large energy relations between the tensor - current and vector - current form factors .",
    "transverse amplitudes in which a vector meson contains a collinear higher fock state gluon also vanish at @xmath315 , as can be seen from the vanishing of the corresponding partonic dipole operator graphs in the same momentum configurations .",
    "furthermore , the transverse @xmath316 contributions involving spectator interactions are highly suppressed .",
    "this has important implications for new physics searches .",
    "for example , in pure penguin decays to cp - conjugate final states @xmath68 , e.g. , @xmath317 , if the transversity basis time - dependent cp asymmetry parameters @xmath318 and @xmath319 are consistent with @xmath320 , and @xmath321 is not , then this would signal new cp violating contributions to the chromomagnetic dipole operators .",
    "however , deviations in @xmath322 or @xmath323 would signal new cp violating four - quark operator contributions .",
    "if the triple - products @xmath324 and @xmath325 ( [ at ] ) do not vanish and vanish , respectively , in pure - penguin decays , then this would also signal new cp violating contributions to the chromomagnetic dipole operators .",
    "this assumes that a significant strong phase difference is measured between @xmath326 and @xmath327 , for which there is some experimental indication @xcite . however , non - vanishing @xmath328 , or non - vanishing transverse direct cp asymmetries would signal the intervention of four - quark operators .",
    "the above would help to discriminate between different explanations for an anomalous @xmath99 , which fall broadly into two categories : radiatively generated dipole operators , e.g. , supersymmetric loops ; or tree - level four - quark operators , e.g. , flavor changing ( leptophobic ) @xmath329 exchange @xcite , @xmath31-parity violating couplings @xcite , or color - octet exchange @xcite . finally , a large value for @xmath287 would be a signal for right - handed _ four - quark _ operators .",
    "there are a large number of penguin - dominated rare hadronic @xmath0 decay modes in the standard model in which departures from null @xmath8 asymmetry predictions would be a signal for new physics .",
    "we have seen that in order to detect the possible intervention of new @xmath16 right - handed currents it is useful to organize these modes according to the parity of the final state .",
    "@xmath9 symmetric models in which new @xmath8 violating contributions to the effective @xmath330 hamiltonian are to good approximation parity symmetric at the weak scale , would only give rise to significant deviations from null @xmath8 asymmetries in parity - odd final states .",
    "for example , no deviations from the null standard model @xmath8 asymmetry predictions in @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath331 , @xmath98 could be accompanied by significant deviations in @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath332 @xmath101 , and @xmath102 .",
    "this would provide a clean signal for left - right symmetry .",
    "however , the precision of @xmath8 asymmetry measurements necessary to discern the existence of such a pattern would require a high luminosity @xmath0 factory .",
    "remarkably , approximate parity invariance in the @xmath333 effective hamiltonian can be realized even if the @xmath3 symmetry breaking scale @xmath110 is as large as @xmath334 .",
    "an explicit example in which large departures from the null predictions are possible , but in which deviations from parity invariance can be as small as @xmath2 for @xmath4 , is provided by squark - gluino loops in parity - symmetric susy models .",
    "it is noteworthy that , due to parity invariance , stringent bounds on new sources of @xmath8 and flavor violation arising from the @xmath135hg mercury edm are naturally evaded in such models .",
    "more generally , in models in which new contributions to standard model ( left - handed ) and opposite chirality ( right - handed ) effective operators are unrelated , the @xmath8 asymmetries in the @xmath77-odd and @xmath77-even null standard model modes could differ substantially both from each other , and from the null predictions .",
    "this is because the right - handed operator wilson coefficients enter with opposite sign in the amplitudes for decays to @xmath77-odd and @xmath77-even final states .",
    "unfortunately , @xmath8 asymmetry predictions have large theoretical uncertainties due to @xmath167 power corrections , especially from the qcd penguin annihilation amplitudes .",
    "we therefore can not rule out substantial differences between new @xmath8 violating effects in parity - even and parity - odd modes arising solely from left - handed currents .",
    "however , very large differences , e.g. , @xmath182 and @xmath183 , may provide a signal for @xmath8 violating right - handed currents .",
    "more theoretical work will be required in order to make this statement more precise .",
    "polarization measurements in @xmath0 decays to light vector meson pairs offer a unique opportunity to probe the chirality structure of rare hadronic @xmath0 decays . a standard model analysis which includes all",
    "non - factorizable graphs in qcd factorization shows that the longitudinal polarization formally satisfies @xmath335 , as in naive factorization .",
    "however , the contributions of a particular qcd penguin annihilation graph which is formally @xmath336 can be @xmath15 numerically in longitudinal and negative helicity @xmath337 @xmath338 decays . consequently",
    ", the observation of @xmath339 can be accounted for , albeit with large theoretical errors .",
    "the expected pattern of @xmath266 violation in the qcd penguin annihilation graphs , i.e. , large suppression of @xmath340 relative to @xmath341 or @xmath342 popping , implies that the longitudinal polarizations should satisfy @xmath272 in the standard model .",
    "consequently , @xmath273 would suggest that @xmath274-spin violating new physics entering mainly in the @xmath275 channel is responsible for the small values of @xmath276 .",
    "the ratio of transverse rates in the transversity basis satisfies @xmath343 , in agreement with naive power counting . a ratio in excess of the predicted standard model range would signal the presence of new right - handed currents in dimension-6 four - quark operators .",
    "the maximum ratio attainable in the standard model is sensitive to the @xmath344 form factor combination @xmath206 , see ( [ rperp ] ) , which controls helicity suppression in form factor transitions .",
    "all existing model determinations give a positive sign for @xmath206 , which would imply @xmath345 in the standard model .",
    "the magnitude and especially the sign of @xmath346 is clearly an important issue which should be clarified further with dedicated lattice studies .",
    "contributions of the dimension-5 @xmath13 dipole operators to the transverse @xmath5 modes are highly suppressed , due to angular momentum conservation .",
    "comparison of @xmath8 violation involving the longitudinal modes with @xmath8 violation only involving the transverse modes in pure penguin @xmath225 decays could therefore distinguish between new contributions to the dipole and four - quark operators .",
    "more broadly , this could distinguish between scenarios in which new physics effects are loop induced and scenarios in which they are tree - level induced , as it is difficult to obtain @xmath15 cp - violating effects from dimension-6 operators beyond tree - level .",
    "again , a high luminosity @xmath0 factory will be required in order to obtain the necessary level of precision in @xmath8 violation measurements .",
