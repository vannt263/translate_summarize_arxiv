    "the origin of the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) remains a mystery . in the standard model ( sm ) , the ewsb requires a negative mass squared for the higgs doublet scalar field , whose magnitude is set by hand .",
    "we expect a fundamental theory which naturally gives the negative mass squared with the suitable value . in a model of supersymmetric extension of the sm",
    ", the ewsb can be realized by so - called radiative breaking  @xcite .",
    "however , the supersymmetry breaking scale must be high because of no signal of super - particle at any experiments so far . in technicolor ( tc )",
    "model  @xcite , the higgs doublet field is no longer an elementary scalar field , and the ewsb is triggered by the techni - fermion condensation under strongly coupled tc gauge interaction .",
    "however , the naive tc model , which is just scale up of qcd , has already been excluded by the electroweak precision measurements .",
    "recently , there are a lot of studies of other possibilities to solve the gauge hierarchy problem by imposing a classically scale invariance with an additional @xmath4 gauge symmetry  @xcite-@xcite . from the viewpoint of bardeen",
    "s argument  @xcite , we can only focus on logarithmic divergences , and the scale invariance protects large higgs mass corrections . under the classically scale invariance in terms of the cutoff regularization",
    ", the quadratic divergence itself can be subtracted by a boundary condition of the uv complete theory  @xcite .",
    "once we subtract the quadratic divergence from the theory , it never appears in the observables . in the model with an additional @xmath4 gauge symmetry ,",
    "the scale invariance is broken by the coleman - weinberg mechanism  @xcite , and if the breaking scale is not so far from the electroweak ( ew ) scale , there is no gauge hierarchy problem . on the other hand",
    ", a strong coupling dynamics can also realize such an ewsb with classically scale invariance  @xcite , where an additional singlet scalar mediates dimensional transmutation in the strong coupling sector to the sm sector .",
    "however , the sign of the coupling between the higgs doublet and the additional scalar is assumed to be negative , so that the negative mass squared of the higgs doublet is realized .",
    "therefore , the origin of the ewsb is not necessary and inevitable in this scenario , and we are going to try the dynamical realization of negative mass squared by the bosonic seesaw mechanism  @xcite .    in this paper , we expand the sm gauge group by @xmath5 technicolor gauge symmetry with the classically scale invariant framework .",
    "the techni - fermions , which belong to vector - like representations under tc gauge symmetry as well as electroweak gauge symmetry , are introduced .",
    "though the chiral symmetry breaking happens by techni - fermion condensations , the ewsb does not happen by this strong coupling tc dynamics itself .",
    "we show that the ewsb dynamically occurs in an inevitable way by the bosonic seesaw mechanism between the elementary higgs scalar field and a composite scalar field . to avoid massless nambu - goldstone ( ng ) bosons by the chiral symmetry breaking in strong coupling sector , we introduce a real pseudo - scalar singlet field and its interactions with techni - fermions and higgs doublet .",
    "we analyze the mass spectrum of the pseudo - ng ( png ) bosons and estimate their decay rates .",
    "we show that the png bosons can decay fast enough to avoid cosmological problems .",
    "we further show that our model can be regarded as the first model of the flatland scenario with strong coupling dynamics .",
    "all three coupling constants in scalar potential can vanish at the planck scale . similarly to the conventional flatland model with coleman - weinberg mechanism , the ew vacuum in our model is meta - stable .",

    "<S> we propose a new dynamics of the electroweak symmetry breaking in a classically scale invariant version of the standard model . </S>",
    "<S> the scale invariance is broken by the condensations of additional fermions under a strong coupling dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the electroweak symmetry breaking is triggered by negative mass squared of the elementary higgs doublet , which is dynamically generated through the bosonic seesaw mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a real pseudo - scalar singlet field interacting with additional fermions and higgs doublet in order to avoid massless nambu - goldstone bosons from the chiral symmetry breaking in a strong coupling sector . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the mass spectra and decay rates of these pseudo - nambu - goldstone bosons , and show they can decay fast enough without cosmological problems . </S>",
    "<S> we further evaluate the energy dependences of the couplings between elementary fields perturbatively , and find that our model is the first one which realizes the flatland scenario with the dimensional transmutation by the strong coupling dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> similarly to the conventional flatland model with coleman - weinberg mechanism , the electroweak vacuum in our model is meta - stable </S>",
