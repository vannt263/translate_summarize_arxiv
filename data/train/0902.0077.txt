    "the study of infrared emission features in evolved stars provides an important avenue to study the chemistry of the circumstellar environment .",
    "first seen in the _ iras _ spectra of four sources @xcite , a new , broad feature was discovered at @xmath521 @xmath1 m ( the so - called `` 21 @xmath1 m feature '' ) .",
    "subsequently , a small number of additional sources with this feature have been identified based on spectra from _ iras _ , _ iso _ , and with the cgs on the united kingdom infrared telescope .",
    "the total number of such sources is about a dozen @xcite .",
    "an _ iso _ study of the strongest sources showed that they all had the same peak wavelength , 20.1 @xmath1 m , and nearly the same shape with no evidence of substructure @xcite .",
    "the 21 @xmath1 m sources all possess two characteristics in common .",
    "first , the 21 @xmath1 m sources are all carbon rich .",
    "this was first deduced based on the presence of molecular c@xmath3 and c@xmath6 in their visible spectra @xcite and later confirmed in detailed high - resolution abundance studies @xcite .",
    "the second common characteristic of the 21 @xmath1 m sources is that they are nearly all proto - planetary nebulae ( ppns ) , objects in transition between the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) and planetary nebula ( pn ) stages of the evolution of intermediate - mass stars . during this stage ,",
    "the extensive agb mass loss has ceased and the central star is surrounded by a detached , expanding envelope of molecular gas and dust .",
    "this stage can last several thousands of years @xcite , during which the central star evolves from spectral type late - g to early - b , after which time it becomes hot enough to photoionize the gas and produce a pn .",
    "( the 21 @xmath1 m feature also appears to be present but weak in a few young pns ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there has been an active search for the carrier of the 21 @xmath1 m feature and many candidates have been suggested , including pahs , fullerenes , and nanodiamonds .",
    "most but not all of the proposed carriers involve carbon . a good match to the feature is produced by tic @xcite , but this requires severe formation constraints due to the low abundance of ti , even in stars like these that have enhanced s - process elements .",
    "sic also provides a fit in this region and without the severe abundance constraints ( see @xcite and references therein ) . however , most carriers suggested have associated emission features at other wavelengths that are absent or unconfirmed in these sources .",
    "a very broad , so - called `` 30 @xmath1 m feature '' has been know for several decades to exist in the spectra of evolved c - rich agb stars and pns @xcite .",
    "it has been attributed to mgs @xcite , which peaks in the range of 30@xmath035 @xmath1 m depending on the temperature of the grain .",
    "subsequent studies have supported this identification @xcite .",
    "it has been seen with _",
    "iso _ in a number of objects ranging from agb stars to ppns to pns @xcite on a dust continuum that peaks at monotonically longer wavelengths in the transition between these stages . on the basis of recent _ iso _ spectra",
    ", it has been claimed that the feature has been resolved into two features centered at 26 and 33 @xmath1 m in ppns , pns , and extreme - agb stars @xcite .",
    "a family of emission features at 3.3 , 6.2 , 7.7 , 11.3 , 12.4 , and 13.3 @xmath1 m ( historically known as unidentified infrared [ uir ] bands ) is commonly observed in the diffuse ism .",
    "although the specific carriers are not identified , it is quite certain that these arise from the stretching and bending modes of carbonaceous materials with an aromatic component , such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs )",
    ". we will refer to these as aromatic infrared bands ( aibs ) . since these aibs",
    "are also observed in carbon - rich pns and ppns , the carriers of these bands are likely to be synthesized in the circumstellar environment of late - type stars .",
    "these are often accompanied in ppns by features at 3.4 and 6.9 @xmath1 m attributed to aliphatic groups attached to the aromatic hydrocarbons @xcite .",
    "the 11.3 , 12.4 , and 13.3 @xmath1 m features lie within the wavelength range of the _ spitzer _ spectrographs .    in this study",
    ", we have obtained _ spitzer _ spectra of seven ppns to further study the 21 @xmath1 m , 30 @xmath1 m , and aib features .",
    "these targets were selected with the goal of completing the mid - infrared study of carbon - rich ppns .",
    "in addition to new targets that met this criterion ( iras 06530@xmath00213 , 07430 + 1115 , 19477 + 2401 ) , we included some carbon - rich ppns known or suspected to possess the 21 @xmath1 m feature based on low s / n _ iso _ or ground - based spectra .",
    "also included for comparison was one additional object that was well observed with _",
    "iso _ but faint enough for spitzer observations .",
    "the target objects were observed with the infrared spectrograph ( irs ; * ? ? ? * ) on the _ spitzer space telescope _ ( _ spitzer _ ; * ? ? ? * ) . most were observed as part of program no .",
    "20208 , pi : b. hrivnak .",
    "the targets were all relatively bright for _ sptizer _ and consequently were all observed in the high resolution modes , short - high ( sh ) and long - high ( lh ) .",
    "these modes consisted of ten overlapping orders , and ranged in wavelength from 10@xmath019.6 @xmath1 m for sh to 19@xmath037 @xmath1 m for lh .",
    "the slit sizes for the two modes are 4.7@xmath7 @xmath8 11.3@xmath7 for sh and 11.1@xmath7 @xmath8 22.3@xmath7 for lh .",
    "each observation consists of two nod positions , located at one - third and two - thirds of the way across the slit ; at each nod position three scan cycles were carried out .",
    "the spectral resolution is r @xmath2 600 .",
    "no off - source background measurements were made for these bright targets .",
    "an observing log is given in table [ obs_log ] .",
    "two of the targets were initially observed using inaccurate coordinates and were re - observed during director s discretionary time .",
    "three of the objects were not observed in this program in the sh mode because they were on the gto program no .",
    "93 , pi : d. cruikshank .",
    "data for these were obtained from the _ spitzer _ archive and have been incorporated into this study .",
    "their observations were made in a similar manner to those described above .",
    "details of these additional observations have also been included in table [ obs_log ] .    unfortunately , the coordinates of some of the targets were not know accurately and thus the stars were not always centered well on the slits .",
    "accurate positions are important since the slits are relatively small compared to those used in previous mid - infrared spectral observations . in some cases , this meant that the spectrum at one or both of the two nod positions was weak or noisy or could not be extracted properly .",
    "peak up was performed with nearby stars using the pcrs .",
    "to avoid such problems in follow - up studies , accurate positions are list in table [ pos ] for each of the targets as derived from accurate ( @xmath91@xmath7 ) 2mass positions .",
    "for the fainter visible sources , source identifications are based on finding charts determined from our ground - based mid - infrared observations .",
    "finding charts for iras 19477 + 2411 magnitudes that we published for iras 19477 + 2401 @xcite were for the nearby source located 8@xmath7 west and 5@xmath7 south , 2mass 19495429 + 2408481 .",
    "the 2mass magnitudes for iras 19447 + 2401 are j=12.61 , h=10.75 , and k=9.61 . ] and 22574 + 6609 are shown by @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the data were initially processed using the data reduction pipeline at the spitzer science center ( ssc ) : version 13.2.0 for the earlier data and version 16.1.0 for the two that were re - observed .",
    "we then used the software program smart @xcite to reduce the data .",
    "we started with the basic calibration data ( bcd ) files .",
    "these were first cleaned for bad pixels using irsclean .",
    "bad pixels included the so - called rogue pixels , which are identified by observing campaign at the ssc , and other bad data which are flagged in the pipe - line .",
    "the spectra were then extracted and defringed .",
    "the resulting spectra were examined manually , by order , within each of the individual scan cycles .",
    "bad data were removed from the edges of the orders .",
    "data spikes not present in all the individual scan cycles or in both of the overlap regions in adjacent orders or in both of the nod positions were treated as artifacts , as were some additional large spikes , and these were removed .",
    "an average spectrum was composed in each nod position . in some cases we made small shifts in flux ( 2@xmath010@xmath10 ) to bring the overlapping orders into better agreement .",
    "the spectra from the two nod positions were then compared and an average spectrum formed if the two spectra agreed . in some cases , as mentioned above , the spectrum from one of the nod positions was near the edge of the slit and the data were of inferior quality ; these spectra were not included .",
    "the spectral region 14.5@xmath014.6 @xmath1 m had lots of spikes in the data and was not a region with overlapping orders ; this resulted in particularly noisy spectra in this region .",
    "the lh spectra beyond 29 @xmath1 m were more noisy and those beyond 36 @xmath1 m were completely deleted .",
    "the sh and lh spectra for each object were then combined , scaling where necessary based on a comparison of the region of spectral overlap from 19.0 to 19.6 @xmath1 m . in all cases",
    "the sh was fainter or similar to the lh ; this may be due to the larger slit size of the lh mode , better accommodating small pointing errors .",
    "therefore we scaled the sh when necessary to match the lh in the overlap region to produce a final spitzer spectrum for reach object covering the region 10 to 36 @xmath1 m .",
    "we note for comparison purposes that previous mid - infrared spectra have been obtained of some of the target objects .",
    "initial observations were at low resolution from space with lrs ( 7.7@xmath023 @xmath1 m , r@xmath525 ) on _ iras _ , or from the air using the kuiper airborne observatory ( kao ; 16@xmath048 @xmath1 m , r@xmath533 ) , or from the ground using cgs3 ( 7.5@xmath013 @xmath1 m , r@xmath550 ; 16@xmath024 @xmath1 m , r@xmath572 ) on the 3.8-m united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) .",
    "higher resolution observations were made more recently with sws01 ( r@xmath5250 ) or sws06 ( r@xmath5600@xmath02000 ) on _ iso_. some of these will be referenced in our following discussion of the new higher - resolution , higher signal - to - noise ratio _",

    "the complete spectrum is shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the spectrum shows strong broad 21 @xmath1 m and 30 @xmath1 m emission features .",
    "also seen are medium - width emission features at 11.4 , 12.3 , 13.2 @xmath1 m , a medium - width feature at 15.9 @xmath1 m and a weak feature at 22.3 @xmath1 m .",
    "the short wavelength sh region is shown separately in figure [ fig2 ] , where the features in that wavelength region can be seen more clearly .",
    "iras 23304 + 6147 is a well - documented 21 @xmath1 m source , being one of the original four _ iras _ sources in which this feature was detected @xcite .",
    "the 30 @xmath1 m feature was discovered by @xcite using the kao .",
    "good observations were subsequently carried out with _ iso _ @xcite , and we observed it again partly for comparison purposes . shown in figure [ fig3 ] are the _ iso _ sws01 ( 3@xmath045 @xmath1 m ) and phot - s ( 3@xmath08 @xmath1 m ) and the kao ( 16@xmath048 @xmath1 m ) spectra along with the _ spitzer _ spectrum .",
    "it can be seen that the spectra are very similar in intensity from 10@xmath019.5 @xmath1 m and similar in shape from 10@xmath027.5 @xmath1 m . beyond this , out to 36 @xmath1 m , the _ iso _ spectrum is about 10@xmath10 higher .",
    "the kao spectrum is roughly similar in flux to the _ spitzer _ spectrum beyond 27 @xmath1 m , but neither it nor the _ iso _ spectrum shows the flattening seen in the _ spitzer _ spectrum beyond 33 @xmath1 m . the new _ spitzer _",

    "studied in detail , this feature appears to have a relatively similar central wavelength and profile shape in each , but different strengths .",
    "uncertainties arise in defining the feature since it sits upon a continuum and adjacent to a very broad 30 @xmath1 m feature , both of which are rising steeply toward longer wavelengths .",

    "this hot ( h ) component was of low density and mass , and served to bring the model into better agreement with the observed flux in the 3@xmath05 @xmath1 m region .",

    "the values for t@xmath33(h ) and r@xmath19(h ) were adjusted to fit the m and l observations .",
    "the density laws for both the cool and hot components are assumed to have the same exponent",
    ". the resulting density ratio of the cool to the hot component ( @xmath16(c)/@xmath16(h ) ) ranges among the models from 7700 to 15,000 at a radius of r@xmath19(c ) , and the hot dust contributes only 1.5@xmath011  @xmath10 of the optical depth at 11.2 @xmath1 m .",
    "the aib plateau features were not included in the modeling .",
    "they are likely produced by some combination of flourescence and non - equilibrium heating , which the dust radiative transfer code does not have the capability to include .",
    "however , they do not carry a large part of the total energy emitted in the mid - infrared and presumably therefore would not have much of an effect on the optical depth in the dust shell or the derived parameters .",
    "iras 22574 + 6609 is a possible exception to this generalization since it has an unusually high optical depth dust shell .",
    "empirical fits to the 21 and 30 @xmath1 m features were added to the continuum .",

    "aperture likely include the nearby ( 5@xmath7 south ) source 2mass 22591874 + 6625430 , which is brighter in j but fainter in h and k. ] such behavior in dust shell models has been seen previously in one - dimensional models of extreme carbon stars including irc+10216 and afgl 3068 , and it is attributed to a non - spherical dust shell geometry",
    ". this may also be the cause in iras 22574 + 6609 .",
    "the visible images show a faint , edge - on bipolar nebula with a dark dust lane @xcite .",
    "we suggest that the extra short wavelength emission is due a low optical depth path ( hole ) out of the dust shell through which some scattered light is escaping , similar to the situation in irc+10216 @xcite .",
    "this may be consistent with the off - center intensity peak seen by @xcite in their high resolution near - ir images of iras 22574 + 6609 .",
    "they show that this peak is not at the center of the nebula and thus is not the central star seen directly .",
    "we have not tried to add extra complexity to the model simply to fit the visible wavelength portion of the sed .",
    "these new model parameters are significantly different from our previous model for this source . however , those were based on much poorer quality _ iso _ spectra , in which we chose to disregard the observed _ iso _ spectrum from 27 to 45 @xmath1 m @xcite . the new model was best fit with a@xmath25 = 0.0 ; however , galactic extinction studies by @xcite suggest a value @xmath302.5 , so we fixed a@xmath25 = 3.0 .",
    "the fit was slightly worse , but at a level that is negligible on figure [ fig6 ] .",
    "_ iras 23304 + 6147 .",
    "_ @xmath0 the model gives a good fit to the sed apart from the emission plateau shortward of 18 @xmath1 m .",
    "a hot dust component is required to fit the m - band excess .",
    "this hot dust contributes less than 2@xmath10 of the optical depth at 11.2 @xmath1 m .",
    "the visible image @xcite is similar to that of iras 06530@xmath00213 , and also suggests a bipolar nebula at some intermediate orientation .",
    "this new model for iras 23304 + 6147 differs slightly from the one that we previously published based in _ iso _",
    "spectra @xcite , due primarily to the adoption of a stellar model rather than a black body for the central star .",
    "thus it can be seen that the model fits are generally good ( excluding the unmodelled aib emission plateau from 8 to 14 @xmath1 m ) , except for iras 22574 + 6609 and perhaps iras 07430 + 1115 .",
    "observations in the 5@xmath010 @xmath1 m range are needed to better constrain the continuum on the short wavelength side of the aib emission plateau .",
    "although most of these ppns are known to have a bipolar morphology , the assumption of spherical symmetry will have little effect on the fitting of the mid - infrared emission and the calculated mass - loss rate .",
    "this is the case because the dust shells are optically thin in the infrared where the dust is detected .",
    "the only exception to this might be iras 22574 + 6609 , where the derived optical depth is much higher than for the other objects . in this case",
    ", the morphology might affect the mid - infrared emission and the resulting observed flux would then depend upon observing orientation .",
    "the cool dust temperatures are similar in these models , with values in the range 120@xmath0150 k at the inner radius of the cool dust shell . including an additional six 21 @xmath1 m sources modelled earlier based on _ iso _ spectra ,",
    "the full range of t@xmath26(c ) is 140 to 210 k ( disregarding the earlier model of iras 22574 + 6609 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the absence of c - rich ppns with higher values of t@xmath26(c ) arises partly from the absence of cooler , spectral type k central stars with smaller detached dust shells , even though there is no bias in detecting these @xcite .",
    "the absence of lower values of t@xmath26(c ) at the inner radius of the 21 @xmath1 m sources suggests that either the carrier is not excited at these lower dust temperatures or that it is destroyed due to the presence of the harder uv radiation field found when the central star has evolved to high temperatures .",
    "the value of t@xmath26(c ) observed in a particular source depends sensitively on the rate of evolution of the central star as well as the expansion velocity of the detached shell .",
    "the temperatures for the hot dust are in the range @xmath5500@xmath0800 k. for iras 05113 + 1347 , 05341 + 0852 , and 23304 + 6147 , the density of the cool dust is 10,000@xmath015,000 times that of the hot dust , but for iras 22574 + 6609 , the ratio is only @xmath5200 , due to the relatively larger amount of hot dust .",
    "many of the values in table [ models ] are scaled to the distance ( d ) , and the mass loss rate ( @xmath17 ) is also scaled to the expansion velocity ( v ) . assuming a luminosity of 8300 l@xmath36 , appropriate for a core mass of 0.63 m@xmath36 @xcite and published expansion velocities , the distances and mass loss rates for each object were calculated .",
    "these are listed in table [ model_results ] .",
    "the mass loss rates range from a 10@xmath37 m@xmath38 to as high as a 6 @xmath8 10@xmath39 m@xmath38 .",
    "these later values are very high and can not be sustained very long in medium and low mass stars .",
    "the total mass of the cool dust shells ( @xmath40 m ) range from 0.22 to 0.95 m@xmath41 .",
    "the total mass of the enhanced shell is a more robust value than the mass loss rate since the width of the shell is not tightly constrained .",
    "the duration of the intense mass loss was calculated based on the shell radii and the expansion velocity , and ranges from 160 to 820 years ; again , these values , based on the width of the shell , are not tightly constrained .",
    "thus the results of the model fits to the seds imply that these post - agb objects lose most of their ejected mass in a short duration of time , 10@xmath42@xmath010@xmath43 years .",
    "a kinematical age since the end of the end of the high mass - loss phase was calculated based on the inner radius of the cool dust shell and the expansion velocity ; this ranges from 1000 to 3000 yr for five of the objects but is only 300 yr for iras 22574 + 6609 .",
    "these values are consistent with the evolutionary ages for post - agb stars @xcite .",
    "the results suggest that iras 22574 + 6609 may be more massive than the other sources , based on its larger value of the ejected mass , the larger expansion velocity , and the apparently shorter time scale of evolution .",
    "the kinematical ages also provide a time scale for the formation of the carrier of the 21 @xmath1 m feature .",
    "these new results for the mass loss rate and mass of the ejected shell can be compared with other published values determined in other ways .",
    "here we have confined ourselves to two different approaches that also involve either discrete denser inner shells or steep density laws .",
    "ueta and meixner have recently modeled the mid - infrared emission from the dusty envelopes of two carbon - rich ppns based on high - resolution images .",
    "they used a model that had an extended agb envelope combined with an equatorially - enhanced discrete shell ejected during a later superwind phase .",
    "both of these are sources with 21 @xmath1 m emission , although they are among the brighter ones and were not included in our present study . for iras 22272 + 5435 ,",
    "the values determined were @xmath17 = 4 @xmath8 10@xmath44 m@xmath38 and @xmath40 t = 1500 years @xcite .",
    "for iras 07134 + 1005 ( hd 56126 ) , for which their model was based on co interferometric observations in addition to mid - infrared images , they determined @xmath17 = 3 @xmath8 10@xmath45 m@xmath38 and @xmath40 t = 840 years @xcite .",
    "these mass loss rate values are a factor of 10 to 100 lower than what we have determined here .",
    "hrivnak & beiging ( 2005 ) determined mass loss rates and shell masses based on their measurements of co gas in several transitional states , which allowed them to sample the co emission further out and closer in to the star .",
    "the observations were modelled with a one - dimensional statistical equilibrium , radiative transfer code .",
    "they did not use a discrete shell with inner and outer boundary , as we have done here , but they did use a steep density law ( @xmath29=3 ) , which produces a dense inner shell .",
    "their values for the mass loss range from a few @xmath8 10@xmath37 m@xmath38 to a few @xmath8 10@xmath45 m@xmath38 , a factor of 10 less than we find here . for three objects in common , our values for the mass loss rate larger by factors of two to 100 .",
    "a comparison of our new model results for mass loss rates with two different studies reveals that our rates are a few to 100 times larger , but are confined to a thinner shell . as mentioned above , our mass loss rates are not as certain as we would like because the shell widths are not well constrained and assumed to be thin .",
    "similar model fits could likely be produced with somewhat thicker shells with approximately the same total mass .",
    "future higher resolution ( 0.1@xmath7 ) imaging than is presently available in the mid - infrared will better constrain these shell widths .",
    "it is the total mass that is the better determined parameter from our models . indeed , comparing the dust masses determined in these studies with our values of 0.7@xmath02.8 @xmath8 10@xmath39 m@xmath46 ( @xmath40m/330 from table [ model_results ] ) , one finds much better agreement .",
    "meixner et al . determined a similar value of 0.8 @xmath8 10@xmath39 m@xmath46 for iras 07134 + 1005 , while ueta et al . determined a value 20 times smaller , 0.03 @xmath8 10@xmath39 m@xmath46 for iras 22272 + 5435 .",
    "if we compare with the hrivnak & bieging mass loss values based on co gas and adjust with our gas - to - dust ratio of 330 , we find dust masses 2@xmath04 times smaller than ours , 0.24 @xmath8 10@xmath39 m@xmath46 and 0.42 @xmath8 10@xmath39 m@xmath46 for iras 07134 + 1005 and iras 22272 + 5435 , respectively .",
    "however , if our gas - to - dust mass ratio is overestimated by a factor of 2@xmath04 , then the agreement would be excellent .",
    "note that meixner et al . determined a gas - to - dust mass ratio of 75 for iras 07134 + 1005 .",
    "our targets were selected with the goal of completing the sample of carbon - rich ppns studied with mid - infrared spectroscopy .",
    "however , three additional carbon - rich ppns were identified in the past few years that were not included @xcite .",
    "therefore the sample of carbon - rich ppns that have been observed in mid - infrared spectroscopy is complete except for these three objects .",
    "below are listed results based primarily on the targets of this study , supplemented by more general results for the sample .",
    "three new 21 @xmath1 m sources were discovered : iras 06530@xmath00213 , 07430 + 1115 and 19477 + 2401 .",
    "this brings to 16 the total of 21 @xmath1 m sources among the ppns @xcite .",
    "improved spectra of this feature were obtained for four others .",
    "these spectra do not show the resolution of the 30 @xmath1 m feature into two features as was claimed based on _ iso _ spectra .",
    "the suggested separation apparently was caused by a bad detector band in the _ iso _ spectra and is not real .",
    "the 11.3 @xmath1 m aib feature is seen in all of the sources .",
    "the feature has a relatively consistent peak wavelength of 11.33@xmath110.03 @xmath1 m .",
    "however , the presence of the features at 12.3 and 13.3 @xmath1 m and their peak wavelengths and shapes vary among the sources .",
    "these results strengthen the correlation between the presence of the 21 @xmath1 m feature and evidence of carbon - rich nature of the sources . in particular , all of the 21 @xmath1 m sources are carbon - rich ( c / o@xmath471.0 ) , possess molecular carbon absorption features ( c@xmath3 , c@xmath6 ) , and possess aib features @xcite .",
    "all carbon - rich ppns that have been observed possess the 21 @xmath1 m , 30 @xmath1 m , and aib emission features .",
    "an exception may be iras 01005 + 7910 ( obe ) , the ppn with the hottest carbon - rich central star , which may or may not possess a weak 21 @xmath1 m feature .",
    "we also note that iras 19500@xmath01709 is unusual in possessing the 21 @xmath1 m ( weak ) and 30 @xmath1 m ( strong ) features but weak or few aib features @xcite .",
    "the 21 @xmath1 m feature is present in all ( but perhaps one ) of the galactic carbon - rich ppns but is absent or weak in extreme carbon stars and pns .",
    "this suggests that the carrier is a common part of the outflow during the ppn phase and that the radiation field is important to the presence of the feature .",
    "we propose ( or this supports the idea ) that the 21 @xmath1 m carrier is produced in the extreme mass loss near the end of the agb phase , is excited during the ppn phase , and is then destroyed in the more extreme uv radiation field of the subsequent pn phase .",
    "a narrow feature at 13.7 @xmath1 m due to c@xmath3h@xmath3 is observed in the spectra of five objects ; it is seen in one source in absorption , in three in emission , and possibly one in both emission and absorption .",
    "these represent the first observations of c@xmath3h@xmath3 emission in a post - agb object .",
    "c@xmath3h@xmath3 absorption is commonly seen as a strong feature in the preceding agb stage of stellar evolution .",
    "while most may be incorporated into larger molecules in the evolution to pn , at least some is still present in some region around the star in the ppn phase .",
    "studies of c@xmath3h@xmath3 provide a potential diagnostic of the physical conditions in the circumstellar envelope and should be followed up with high - resolution spectroscopy .    \\9 . at @xmath515.8 @xmath1",
    "m a broad ( @xmath51.3 @xmath1 m ) , unidentified emission feature is seen in the _ spitzer _ spectra of four sources .",
    "this feature also appears to be present in _",
    "spectra of several additional 21 @xmath1 m sources .",
    "it is particularly strong in the two _ spitzer _ sources with the relatively strongest 21 @xmath1 m feature .",
    "this suggests a possible correlation between the two features which , if confirmed , could be a valuable aid in the identification of the 21 @xmath1 m feature .",
    "1-d modeling of the seds indicates a dense cool ( 120@xmath0150 k ) shell of dust around the stars and also low density hot ( 500@xmath0800 k ) dust closer to the star .",
    "the mass - loss rates when the shells detached are high , ranging from a 10@xmath37 m@xmath38 to a 6 @xmath8 10@xmath39 m@xmath38 but the highest rates were not sustained for long .",
    "these result in shell masses of 0.2 to 1.0 m@xmath41 , ejected over intervals of 160 to 820 years .",
    "the results of the modeling of the dust shells imply ages since the termination of extensive mass loss of 1000@xmath03000 years for all of the sources except iras 22574 + 6609 .",
    "these ages for the expansion of the shell are consistent with the evolutionary ages of low - mass , post - agb central stars @xcite , as they should be .",
    "iras 22574 + 6609 appears to have only relatively recently left the agb , @xmath5300 years ago .",

    "<S> we have carried out mid - infrared spectroscopy of seven galactic proto - planetary nebulae ( ppns ) using the _ spitzer space telescope_. they were observed from 10@xmath036 @xmath1 m at relatively high spectral resolution , r@xmath2600 . </S>",
    "<S> the sample was chosen because they all gave some evidence in the visible of a carbon - rich chemistry . </S>",
    "<S> all seven of the sources show the broad , unidentified 21 @xmath1 m emission feature ; three of them are new detections ( iras 06530@xmath00213 , 07430 + 1115 , and 19477 + 2401 ) and the others are observed at higher s / n than in previous spectra . </S>",
    "<S> these have the same shape and central wavelength ( 20.1 @xmath1 m ) as found in the _ iso _ spectra of the brighter ppns . </S>",
    "<S> the 30 @xmath1 m feature was seen in all seven objects . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is not resolved into two separate features ( 26 and 33 @xmath1 m ) as was claimed on the basis of _ iso _ spectra , which presumably suffered from the noisy detector bands in this region . </S>",
    "<S> all showed the infrared aromatic bands ( aib ) at 11.3 , 12.4 , and 13.3 @xmath1 m . </S>",
    "<S> five of these also appear to have the c@xmath3h@xmath3 molecular band at 13.7 @xmath1 m , one in absorption and four in emission . </S>",
    "<S> this is extremely rare , with only one other evolved star , irc@xmath410216 , in which c@xmath3h@xmath3 emission has been observed . </S>",
    "<S> four also possessed a broad , unidentified emission feature at 15.8 @xmath1 m that may possibly be related to the 21 @xmath1 m feature . </S>",
    "<S> model fits were made to the spectral energy distributions for these ppns to determine properties of the detached circumstellar envelopes . </S>",
    "<S> the 21 @xmath1 m feature has been seen in all galactic carbon - rich ppns observed , and thus its carrier appears to be a common component of the outflow around these objects . </S>"
