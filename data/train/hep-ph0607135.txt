    "low energy nonperturbative properties of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) put forward a great challenge to physicists as the @xmath6 gauge coupling at low energy scale does not allow perturbative calculations . among the existing theoretical approaches , the coupled rainbow schwinger - dyson equation",
    "( sde ) and ladder bethe - salpeter equation ( bse ) are typical .",
    "they have been very successful in describing the long distance properties of low energy qcd and the qcd vacuum ( for reviews , one can consult refs.@xcite ) .",
    "the sde can naturally embody dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and confinement , which are two crucial features of qcd , although they correspond to two very different energy scales @xcite .",
    "the possible interplay of two dynamics lies in the following two facts : the first one is that at high energy scale the chiral massive quark dresses itself with a gluon cloud and quark - antiquark pairs , and creates a constituent quark mass ; the second one is the double role of the light pseudoscalar mesons , as both nambu - goldstone bosons and @xmath7 bound states .",
    "the bse is a conventional approach in dealing with two - body relativistic bound state problems @xcite . from solutions of the bse",
    ", we can obtain useful information about the bound state structure of the mesons and obtain powerful tests of the quark theory .",
    "many analytical and numerical calculations indicate that the coupled rainbow sde and ladder bse with phenomenological potentials can give model independent results and satisfactory values @xcite .",
    "the pseudoscalar mesons , especially the @xmath8 and @xmath9 , have been studied extensively to understand the bound state structures from nonperturbative qcd ( for example , ref.@xcite , for more literature , one can consult refs.@xcite ) .",
    "chiral symmetry and axial ward identity play an important role , in chiral limit , the dominating bethe - salpeter amplitude ( bsa ) of the pseudoscalar mesons with the structure @xmath10 is given by , where @xmath11 is the scalar part of the quark self - energy and @xmath12 is the decay constant of the pseudoscalar meson",
    ". we can perform many phenomenological analysis without solving the bse explicitly .",
    "the situation is much worse for the vector mesons .",
    "there is a conserved vector current and the corresponding ward identity relates the longitudinal ( not transverse ) part of the vector vertex with the quark propagator .",
    "we can not obtain dynamical insight into the relevant degrees of freedom without solving the bse directly .",
    "furthermore , it is more difficult to solve the vector bse than the pseudoscalar bse due to a larger number of covariants and higher masses , which require extrapolation into larger domain of the complex @xmath13 plane @xcite .",
    "the often used effective potential models are confining dirac @xmath14 function potential , gaussian distribution potential and flat bottom potential ( fbp ) @xcite .",
    "the fbp is a sum of yukawa potentials , which not only satisfies gauge invariance , chiral invariance and fully relativistic covariance , but also suppresses the singular point which the yukawa potential has .",
    "it displays dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and confinement @xcite , and works well in understanding the qcd vacuum ( for example , the quark condensate , mixed condensate and vacuum susceptibility ) as well as the meson structures ( for example , the electromagnetic form factors , radius and decay constants)@xcite .    in this article",
    ", we take the point of view that the @xmath0 meson is the @xmath7 bound state , and study its structure and decay constant in the framework of the coupled rainbow sde and ladder bse with the infrared modified fbp , which take advantages of both the gaussian distribution potential and the fbp .",
    "the article is arranged as the followings : we introduce the infrared modified fbp in section ii ; in section iii , iv and v , we solve the coupled rainbow sde and ladder bse , study analytical property of the quark propagators , finally obtain the mass and decay constant of the @xmath0 meson ; section vi is reserved for conclusion .",
    "the present techniques in qcd calculation can not give satisfactory analytical results for the infrared behavior of the two - point green s function of the gluon .",
    "infrared enhanced effective potential models have been phenomenologically quite successful @xcite .",
    "one can use a gaussian distribution function to represent the infrared behavior of the two - point green s function of the gluon , @xmath15 , the coordinate @xmath16 , the momentum @xmath17 .",
    "] , @xmath18 which determines the quark - antiquark interaction through a strength parameter @xmath19 and a range parameter @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "this form is inspired by the dirac @xmath14 function potential ( in other words the infrared dominated potential ) used in ref.@xcite , which it approaches in limit @xmath21 .",
    "the integral @xmath22 is finite for spacelike squared momentum @xmath13 .",
    "such an infrared behavior can result in large dressing for the quark s schwinger - dyson functions ( sdfs ) @xmath23 and @xmath24 near @xmath25 , the curves at the infrared region may be steep enough to forbid extrapolation to deep timelike region .",
    "when we introduce an extra factor , @xmath26 , the modified gaussian distribution can result in more flat curve near zero momentum .",
    "furthermore , systematic studies with the coupled sdes of the quark , gluon and ghost indicate this type of behavior at about @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "we use the following modified gaussian distribution to represent the infrared behavior of the two - point green s function of the gluon @xcite , @xmath28 in numerical calculation , the range parameter @xmath20 is taken to be @xmath29 , the gaussian type of function @xmath30 centers around @xmath31 , and extends to about @xmath32 .",
    "systematic studies with the coupled sdes indicate that the nonperturbative gluon propagator is greatly enhanced at about @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "the value @xmath29 is more reasonable than the value @xmath34 taken in ref.@xcite .    for intermediate momentum , we take the fbp as the best approximation and neglect the contribution from perturbative qcd calculations as the strong coupling constant at high energy scale is very small . the fbp is a sum of yukawa potentials which is an analogy to exchange of a series of particles and ghosts with different masses , @xmath35 where @xmath36 stands for the minimum value of the masses , @xmath37 is their mass difference , and @xmath38 is their relative coupling constant .",
    "definition of momentum regions between infrared and intermediate momentum is about @xmath39 , which is set up naturally by the minimum value of the masses @xmath40 .",
    "certainly , there are some overlaps between those regions , in this way , we can guarantee continuity for the momentum .",
    "the fbp at energy @xmath41 with @xmath42 extends to the perturbative region and exhibits some perturbative characters .",
    "the infrared modified fbp is supposed to embody a great deal of physical information about all momentum regions .    due to the particular condition",
    "we take for the fbp , there is no divergence in solving the sde . in its three dimensional form , the fbp takes the following form , @xmath43 in order to suppress the singular point at @xmath44 , we take the following conditions , @xmath45 the @xmath38 can be determined by solving equations inferred from the flat bottom condition . as in previous literature @xcite , @xmath46 is set to be 9 .",
    "the gluon propagator can be approximated by @xmath47",
    "the sde , in effect the functional euler - lagrange equation of quantum field theory , provides a natural framework for studying the nonperturbative properties of quark and gluon green s functions . by studying the evolution behavior and analytic structure of the dressed quark propagator",
    ", one can obtain valuable information about dynamical chiral symmetry breaking phenomenon and confinement . in the rainbow approximation",
