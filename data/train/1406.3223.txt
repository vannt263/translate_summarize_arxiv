    "a ramanujan graph is a @xmath0-regular finite graph with nontrivial eigenvalues @xmath1 satisfying @xmath2 this condition is equivalent to the `` graph theoretical riemann hypothesis '' for the ihara zeta function associated to the graph , see @xcite for more information .",
    "the above equivalence was first formulated by sunada in @xcite .",
    "infinite families of @xmath0-regular ramanujan graphs of increasing size are examples of the more general families of expander graphs .",
    "in fact , the families of ramanujan graphs are the expander families that are optimal from the spectral point of view , according to the bounds by alon and boppana . furthermore , the known constructions of families of ramanujan graphs are essentially number theoretical ; for instance , the proof of the ramanujan property ( [ eqn : ramprop ] ) for the original families is related to the ramanujan conjecture for modular forms of weight 2 .",
    "the families of expanders have applications to engineering and computer science , among others areas @xcite .",
    "the original construction of families of ramanujan graphs was presented by lubotzky , phillips and sarnak in @xcite _ _ * * _ _ , and independently by margulis in @xcite .",
    "the former construction consists of cayley graphs on projective linear groups over a finite field .",
    "the use of cayley graphs allows to utilize the properties of the underlying group and the generating set to determine structural and spectral properties of the graph .",
    "for example , the irreducible representations of the underlying group are directly related to the eigenvalues of the graph .",
    "recently , there has been work on generalizing the notion of group determinant as a function of a group - subgroup pair using the representation theory of @xmath3-determinants @xcite .",
    "the resulting wreath determinant for group - subgroup pairs shares some of the properties of the group determinant , but there is a nontrivial relation with the chosen ordering of the group and subgroup elements .",
    "some results on factorization for this determinant can be found on @xcite , it turns out to be closely related to the representation of the symmetric groups associated with the given group and subgroup and their wreath product .",
    "it was suggested to the author by masato wakayama that one could employ the same strategy to extend existing constructions , or to conceive new constructions , of ramanujan graphs and expanders based on groups , in particular , by generalizing cayley graphs . in this paper",
    ", we apply these ideas to introduce an extension of cayley graphs for a group - subgroup pair .",
    "the motivation is twofold , one is to have further tools to solve problems , in particular the construction of ramanujan graphs ; and to continue the work on this incipient group - subgroup study philosophy .    the main purpose of this paper is to introduce the concept of group - subgroup pair graph based on these considerations and show its elementary properties . in particular , the degree of the vertices of the pair graph is determined by the coset structure of the subgroup and the chosen generating set .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "the definition , examples and basic properties are presented .",
    "namely , the determination of the degrees of the vertices of the graph , and the conditions for the graph to be regular . in section 3 ,",
    "conditions for connectedness of the graph are completely determined , along with the number and properties of connected components for disconnected graphs .",
    "additionally , sufficient conditions for the graphs to be bipartite and the notion of trivial eigenvalues are introduced for the group - subgroup pair graphs . in section 4",
    "we limit the discussion to the regular graph case and assert a symmetry relation between the spectrum for different choices of generating set for fixed group and subgroup , this result is applied to give a sufficient condition on the size of the generating set that guarantees that the resulting graphs are ramanujan graphs .",
    "we provide two examples of ramanujan graphs obtained by using this condition .",
    "the common theme throughout this paper is to compare and relate the results on group - subgroup pair graphs with results on cayley graphs .",
    "in this section we introduce the group - subgroup pair graph , a cayley - type graph construction for group - subgroup pairs ; relate the definition with the group matrix and establish some elementary properties of the graphs .",
    "first , we introduce the conventions and notation used in this paper .",
    "all groups are assumed to be finite unless otherwise stated and @xmath4 always represents the identity of a given group g. for a subgroup @xmath5 of @xmath6 , all cosets are assumed to be right cosets and we say that @xmath7 is incongruent to @xmath8 modulo @xmath5 when @xmath9 .",
    "a subset @xmath10 is said to be symmetric if @xmath11 . for a given group @xmath6 and symmetric subset @xmath12",
    "we denote the corresponding cayley graph by @xmath13 .",
    "the characteristic function of a subset @xmath14 is denoted @xmath15 and the notation @xmath16 $ ] for @xmath17 is used for the set @xmath18 .",
    "[ def]let @xmath6 be a group , @xmath5 a subgroup and @xmath19 a subset such that @xmath20 is a symmetric subset of @xmath6 .",
    "then the * group - subgroup pair graph * @xmath21 is the graphwith vertex set g and edges @xmath22    equivalently , the group - subgroup pair graph @xmath21 can be defined as @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the generalized edge sum operator , as defined in @xcite .",
    "the graph @xmath27 is a cayley graph and the graph @xmath28 is the graph with vertices @xmath6 and edges @xmath29 according to the alternative definition , the group - subgroup pair graph @xmath21 can be thought informally as the undirected graph consisting of an inner cayley graph of @xmath5 determined by @xmath30 and an outer graph that connects vertices of @xmath5 with vertices of @xmath31 .",
    "the notation @xmath32 and @xmath30 is used throughout this paper with the same meaning as in the previous definition .    when @xmath33 , the generating set is @xmath34 and the corresponding graphs is a cayley graph , in other words , @xmath35 .",
    "this justifies the claim that the group - subgroup pair graphs are a generalization of the cayley graphs and the seemingly artificial condition of symmetry of @xmath36 .",
    "when @xmath12 is empty , we call the resulting pair graph @xmath21 or cayley graph @xmath13 trivial .",
    "[ example1]let @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 , then @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",

    "this connected graph has 480 vertices with vertices of degrees @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "note that none of the graphs of the preceding examples can be constructed as cayley graphs .",
    "we briefly mention another generalization of cayley graphs for group @xmath6 and subgroup @xmath5 , the _ schreier coset graph_. for a symmetric subset @xmath12 of @xmath6 , the schreier coset graph is defined as the graph with the set @xmath54 of coset as vertices and where two cosets @xmath55 and @xmath56 are adjacent when there is an @xmath57 such that @xmath58 a schreier coset graph can have multiples edges and loops ( even when @xmath59 ) .",
    "this kind of graphs have been used for coset enumeration techniques .",
    "a detailed exposition can be found in @xcite .    for a given group @xmath6 , the schreier coset graph is a cayley graph when @xmath60 , whereas the group - subgroup pair graph is a cayley graph when @xmath61 .",
    "as stated in the introduction , one of the motivation for the group - subgroup pair graph comes from the extension of the group determinant for a group - subgroup pair , called _ wreath determinant for group - subgroup pair_s . in this subsection",
    "we show how one can relate the adjacency matrix of a cayley graph with the group matrix of the corresponding group ; then , by extending the idea for the matrix used for the wreath determinant for group - subgroup pairs we obtain the rows corresponding to the subgroup on the adjacency matrix of a certain group - subgroup pair graph , which is enough to determine the complete adjacency graph .    for a group @xmath62 , consider a polynomial ring @xmath63 containing the indeterminates @xmath64 , for @xmath65 , then the _ group matrix _ is a matrix @xmath66 in @xmath67 defined by @xmath68 for @xmath69 $ ] and where @xmath70 $ ] is an enumeration function for @xmath6 , used implicitly .",
    "the determinant @xmath71 of the group matrix is called _ group determinant _ of @xmath6 and does not depend on the chosen enumeration of the elements of @xmath6 .",
