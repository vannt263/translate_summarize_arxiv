    "with the development of the string theory and higher - dimensional brane - world models , black holes in more than four space - time dimensions became a key subject in the modern high energy physics .",
    "nevertheless , one of the first @xmath0-dimensional generalizations of the schwarzschild metric was done , yet , in 1963 by tangherlini @xcite .",
    "this solution has attracted considerable interest recent years , in the context of brane - world models @xcite , and , for asymptotically anti - de sitter case , within ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "different generalizations of the tangherlini metric were found @xcite . and",
    "their properties were investigated in @xcite .",
    "one of the most important property of a black hole metric is stability .",
    "space - times unstable against small metric perturbations should not exist , or need some other , probably quantum , mechanisms to provide stability .",
    "if a black hole is unstable , small perturbations must grow with time , being governed by characteristic complex frequencies @xmath4 , called _",
    "quasinormal modes_. these frequencies form a spectrum of the response of a black hole to the external perturbation .",
    "contribution of all modes can be seen in the _ time domain _ @xcite . until now , during recent few years , evolution of perturbations of the @xmath0-dimensional black holes was investigated in a number of works .",
    "a lot of papers were devoted to perturbations of scalar test fields propagating in the vicinity of spherically symmetric black holes @xcite .",
    "scalar qnms of higher - dimensional kerr black holes were analyzed in @xcite .",
    "quasinormal spectrum of standard model fields for brane - localized black holes were investigated in @xcite . in @xcite , a variety of brane - localized backgrounds ( schwarzschild , reissner - nordstrm and schwarzschild-(anti ) de sitter )",
    "were investigated , and it was shown that an increase in the number of hidden , extra dimensions results in the faster damping of all fields living on the brane . in @xcite",
    "rotating black holes on the brane were considered , and , it was shown that the brane - localized field perturbations are longer - lived when the higher - dimensional black hole rotates faster .    in the context of tev - gravity scenarios , the gravitational energy loss in high energy particles collisions",
    "was considered in @xcite , where was found energy spectra , total energy and angular distribution of the emitted gravitational radiation .",
    "the further steps were analysis of the graviton emission form the higher dimensional black holes @xcite and the close limit analysis for head - on collision of two black holes in higher dimensions @xcite .",
    "in addition , some analytical solutions were found in different @xmath5 space - times @xcite .",
    "the high overtone asymptotics for perturbations of @xmath0-dimensional black holes were considered in @xcite .    after appearing of the paper of kodama and ishibashi @xcite , where gravitational perturbations of the @xmath0-dimensional spherically symmetric black hole with charge and @xmath6-term were reduced to the schrodinger wave - like equations : @xmath7 the low - laying gravitational quasinormal modes were found found in @xcite with the help of the wkb method @xcite . in ( [ wavelike ] ) , @xmath8 runs @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , because for @xmath5 , in addition to the well - known in four dimensions axial and polar perturbations , which are vector and scalar types of gravitational perturbations respectively , there appears a new type of gravitational perturbations called tensor one . for @xmath0-dimensional reissner - nordstrm-(anti)-de",
    "sitter black holes the tensor type of gravitational perturbations coincide with perturbations of test scalar filed . in the einstein theory with the gauss - bonnet term , from works @xcite , it follows that this coincidence does not take place .",
    "an important feature of the gravitational perturbations is that the effective potentials which governs the scalar type of the perturbations has negative gap for @xmath12 , and this gap becomes deeper when @xmath0 is increased . if the effective potential @xmath13 is positive definite everywhere outside the black hole , event horizon , the differential operator @xmath14 is positive self - adjoint operator in the hilbert space of the square integrable functions of @xmath15 . as a result ,",
    "any solution of the wave equation with compact support is bounded , what implies stability . in some cases this negative gap of the potential",
    "can be removed by the so - called s - deformation of the potential which does not change the property of stability @xcite . in this way ishibashi and kodama in @xcite , showed that @xmath0-dimensional schwarzschild black holes are stable against all three types of gravitational perturbations . yet",
    ", the potential for scalar type of gravitational perturbations of reissner - nordstrm black holes can not be made positive definite by s - deformation , and therefore _ the question of stability of charged multidimensional black holes left open_. that is why to judge about ( in)stability of black holes we have to consider evolution of gravitational perturbations of @xmath0-dimensional black hole with special emphasis in scalar type of gravitational perturbations .",
    "note , that with the help of the wkb method , one can find only low laying modes for not very large @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "therefore we have to apply here the frobenius method @xcite . yet",
    ", even frobenius method shows rather bad convergence for higher @xmath0 and , this made us to apply , alternatively , the time - domain approach . in the present paper",
    "we have found all three types of gravitational quasinormal modes and have shown that _ the d=5 - 11 reissner - nordstrm(-de sitter )",
    "black holes are stable for any values of charge or @xmath2-term_.    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ formulae::sec ] we give the basic formulas and discuss the range of parameters for the @xmath0-dimensional reissner - nordstrm(-de sitter ) metric and of its gravitational perturbations .",
    "sec [ numericalmethods::sec ] describes the numerical method we used in time and frequency domain .",
    "sec [ numericalmethods::sec ] relates the obtained quasinormal modes and time - domain profiles for reissner - nordstrm(-de sitter ) black holes in @xmath3 space - time dimensions .",
    "finally we discuss the obtained results and conclude that all considered cases are stable .",
    "the metric of the @xmath0-dimensional reissner - nordstrm - de - sitter black holes is given by the formula    @xmath16    where @xmath17 @xmath18    the wave equation can be re - written in the form @xmath19 where _ the tortoise coordinate _",
    "@xmath20 is defined as @xmath21    the effective potentials for tensor @xmath22 and vector gravitational perturbations @xmath23 are designated as @xmath24 , @xmath25 respectively .    the effective potential for the scalar type is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27    @xmath28    here we used @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the multipole number .",
    "we shall measure all the quantities in the units of the horizon radius .",
    "thus we define @xmath32    in order to parameterize the cosmological constant , we introduce the parameter @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the cosmological horizon .",
    "the value @xmath35 corresponds to the pure @xmath0-dimensional reissner - nordstrm black hole .",
    "then , @xmath2 in terms of @xmath1 and @xmath36 can be find from the equation @xmath37 solving the equation ( [ lambda - parameterize ] ) , one can find @xmath38    it is clear that for each @xmath2 there is some extremal charge @xmath39 .",
    "the value of @xmath39 can be found from @xmath40 for any charge @xmath41 , the definition ( [ horizon - units ] ) is not correct because in this case , the real event horizon has radius greater than one .    substituting ( [ lambda - solution ] ) into ( [ extremal - charge ] ) , one can find @xmath42    within this paper we shall use @xmath36 and @xmath43 as the black hole parameters .",
    "note that the formulas ( [ extremal - charge - found ] ) and ( [ lambda - solution ] ) allow us to find @xmath1 and @xmath2 in terms of @xmath44 and @xmath45 . in the particular asymptotically flat case ( @xmath46 )",
    ", we have @xmath47 and , therefore , @xmath48 .",
    "by definition , the quasi - normal modes are eigenvalues of @xmath4 with the boundary conditions which correspond to the outgoing wave at the cosmological horizon ( or spatial infinity when @xmath35 ) and the ingoing wave at the black hole horizon .    in order to find quasi - normal spectrum for the considered types of perturbations",
    ", we shall use the continued fraction method @xcite .",
    "the equation ( [ wavelike ] ) has a different kind of singularity at @xmath49 : if @xmath35 , the singularity is irregular at infinity as usually for the schwarzschild case @xmath50 while for @xmath51 the point of the cosmological horizon is a regular singularity @xcite @xmath52 it turns out , that we can simply exclude this singularity by the introducing of the new function @xmath53 where @xmath54 satisfies @xmath55 in order to satisfy the qnm boundary conditions , the function @xmath54 has to be convergent at @xmath49 .",
    "thus , the only valuable singularity remains at @xmath56 .",
    "taking into account that there is only the ingoing wave at the event horizon , one can find @xmath57 finally , we obtain @xmath58 where y(r ) is convergent on @xmath59 $ ] . the appropriate frobenius series for @xmath60 are @xmath61 where @xmath62 is an _ arbitrary _",
    "parameter .",
    "the expansion ( [ frobenius ] ) is valid if all singular points ( except those on the event and the cosmological horizons ) satisfy inequality @xmath63 since for the effective potential of the gravitational perturbations of vector and tensor types the singular points are 1 ) @xmath64 and 2 ) the solutions of the equation @xmath65 , we can always find such @xmath66 to satisfy inequality ( [ singular - inequality ] ) for all the additional singular points .",
    "the latter follows from the definition of the horizons , which are the two larger positive solutions of the equation @xmath65 .",
    "after @xmath67 is fixed , following @xcite , one can find the recurrence relation for the coefficients @xmath68 in ( [ frobenius ] ) and use the continued fraction method with the generalized nollert improvement @xcite .",
    "it turns out , that the convergence of the method becomes worse when @xmath69 .",
    "thus one has to choose the minimal value of @xmath67 that satisfies the inequality ( [ singular - inequality ] ) for all singular points , except those at the event and the cosmological horizons . for @xmath70",
    "this point is @xmath71 , which is the remaining positive root of @xmath72 ( or @xmath73 if @xmath72 has no more positive root ) , and the continued fraction method converges without the generalized nollert improvement . for larger @xmath0 such",
    "@xmath67 is , generally , not a singular point of the equation ( [ phi - equation ] ) and the convergence of the method is provided by the procedure @xcite . alternatively , for @xmath74 one can continue the frobenius series through some midpoints .",
    "this method was used in @xcite and our results are completely in agreement with it .    for the scalar - type gravitational perturbations , the equation ( [ phi - equation ] )",
    "has additional singularities , which are the roots of @xmath75 .",
    "thus , in higher dimensions @xmath76 , for some values of @xmath36 , @xmath77 and @xmath31 there is no such @xmath62 , which satisfies the inequality ( [ singular - inequality ] ) for all the singular points .",
    "therefore , for those cases one should use only the technique developed in @xcite . practically , the continued fraction coefficients appear to be so complicated , that we are unable to compute qnms with this method during reasonable time , even for low dimensions , except the case when @xmath35 .      alternatively , we shall use the time - domain analysis based on the standard integration scheme for the wave - like equations ( [ hyperbolic ] ) , which is described for instance in @xcite .",
    "this approach has no limitations of the parameters for the scalar - type perturbations .",
    "moreover , it appears to be quicker for the perturbations of scalar type , when @xmath0 is large or @xmath78 .",
    "since we can see the real signal which contains all the frequencies , this method also provides the most direct evidence of the black hole stability .",
    "it allows also to find out asymptotical tails . in detail",
    ", we applied a numerical characteristic integration scheme , that uses the light - cone variables @xmath79 and @xmath80 . in the characteristic initial value problem ,",
    "initial data are specified on the two null surfaces @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "the discretization scheme we used , is @xmath83 where we have used the following definitions for the points : @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the existing literature on vector and tensor type of gravitational perturbations is much fuller for the schwarzschild case @xcite , .",
    "in addition the effective potential is positive definite for these types of perturbations , so we do not suspect instability in them .",
    "the fundamental modes for vector type @xmath88 gravitational perturbations are given in table [ vector+qqnms ] : the real oscillation frequency of the dominating mode is growing as the charge @xmath1 grows , and after reaching some maximum , is decaying . for @xmath89 , the maximum of @xmath90 happens for @xmath91 .",
    "this value of charge , at which @xmath90 has maximum , is increasing for higher @xmath0 , and is about @xmath92 for @xmath93 . the imaginary part of the frequency is monotonically decreasing as @xmath1 is increasing for vector type @xmath88 perturbations for all @xmath0 .",
    "the vector type @xmath94 of gravitational perturbations for reissner - nordstrm case has rather different behavior ( see table [ vector+qqnms ] ) : both @xmath95 and @xmath96 are monotonically decaying as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "let us note that for vector type of gravitational perturbations we perfectly reproduce the results of the pure schwarzschild limit of the previous papers @xcite .",
    "thus , for example , for @xmath89 we get in table [ vector+qqnms ] : @xmath97 for vector type @xmath94 of gravitational perturbations obtained with the time - domain approach , while the frobenius method in @xcite give @xmath98 .",
    "let us remember that for vector type of gravitational perturbations there are the two types @xmath94 and @xmath88 of perturbations , because in fact we have the perturbations of the maxwell field and of gravitational field , which are coupled .",
    "thereby the type @xmath88 of vector perturbations reduces to the perturbations of the test maxwell field when the electromagnetic background vanishes @xmath99 .",
    "dependence of the qnms on the values of the @xmath2-term parameter is the same for both types of vector perturbations : both @xmath96 and @xmath90 are monotonically decreasing when @xmath2 is increasing .",
    "the tensor type of gravitational perturbations is known to coincide with perturbations of test scalar field @xcite , and the corresponding quasinormal spectrum is isospectral as well @xcite .",
    "the fundamental modes for pure reissner - nordstrm and schwarzschild - de sitter cases are given in tables vii and viii .",
    "both real and imaginary parts of quasinormal frequencies are monotonically decreasing as charge or @xmath2-term is increasing .    this way one has quasinormal modes for all types of gravitational perturbations analyzed for reissner - nordstrm - de sitter black holes .",
    "multidimensional black holes are subject of intensive research in brane - world theories during recent years , because they are expected to be produced in particles collisions in large hadron collider or in cosmic showers experiments . the basic feature one needs to provide reliability of the black hole metric is stability . yet",
    "the stability of charged multidimensional black holes with charge and @xmath2-term for @xmath100 was an open question until the present research .",
    "we have performed here an extensive time and frequency domains investigation of a response of multidimensional black holes with arbitrary charge and @xmath2-term and showed that the response is decaying and thereby the black holes under consideration are stable . as a by product we presented a detailed data on quasinormal frequencies for the considered black holes and the dependence of the frequencies on such parameters as black hole charge and the value of the cosmological term .    the are a few important points beyond our consideration : first of all , it is gauss - bonnet generalizations of the einstein solutions @xcite , where an instability can happen even in asymptotically flat case @xcite in @xmath89 case .",
    "there numerical analysis of the gravitational perturbations of the gauss - bonnet black holes for different @xmath0 is in progress @xcite .",
    "another important and interesting case is asymptotically anti - de sitter charged black holes , when the instability also exists @xcite and can be interpreted as a phase transition in the dual temperature conformal field theory @xcite .",
    "apparently , an interesting alternative model for higher dimensional black holes as a window in extra dimensions is the kaluza - klein black holes with squashed horizons @xcite .",
    "the gravitational perturbations for these solution would be especially actual , as they would probably show gravitational instability of the gregory - laflamme type .",

    "<S> this gap , for some values of the parameters @xmath1 ( charge ) , @xmath2 ( cosmological constant ) and @xmath0 ( number of space - time dimensions ) , can not be removed by s - deformations . </S>",
    "<S> thereby , there is no proof of ( in)stability for those cases . in the present paper , by an extensive search of quasinormal modes , both in time and frequency domains , we shall show that spherically symmetric static black holes with arbitrary charge and positive ( de sitter ) lambda - term are stable for @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we give a complete numerical data for all three types ( scalar , vector and tensor ) of gravitational perturbations for multi - dimensional black holes with charge and @xmath2-term . the influence of charge , @xmath2-term and number of extra dimensions on black hole quasinormal spectrum </S>",
    "<S> is discussed . </S>"
