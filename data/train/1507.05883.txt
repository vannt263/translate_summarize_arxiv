    "it follows from the hamiltonian formulation that a necessary condition for the existence of the desired orbits is that the energy level set @xmath24 intersects both the conormal bundles of @xmath4 and @xmath5 , namely @xmath31 this condition alone is unfortunately not sufficient to guarantee existence , as we will show in the counterexamples section [ counterexamples ] ( cf .",

    "when @xmath42 and @xmath43 are points in @xmath35 , the question above reduces to the problem of finding those energy levels which contain euler - lagrange orbits connecting @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",

    "* chapter i.3 and appendix f ) ) .",
    "we will get back on this later on and in the last section ( see paragraph `` orbits connecting two points '' ) .",
    "the conormal boundary conditions make also sense for submanifolds of @xmath48 which are not necessarily of the form @xmath49 . in this sense",
    ", the problem of finding periodic orbits of the euler - lagrange flow can be viewed as the problem of finding euler - lagrange orbits satisfying the conormal boundary conditions for @xmath50 diagonal .",
    "the key fact that will be exploited throughout this paper is that euler - lagrange orbits with energy @xmath3 satisfying the conormal boundary conditions correspond to the critical points of the _ free - time lagrangian action functional _ @xmath51\\ , ds\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath52 and @xmath53,m)\\times ( 0,+\\infty)$ ] is the hilbert manifold of @xmath54-paths connecting @xmath4 with @xmath5 and with arbitrary interval of definition .",

    "hereafter all the lagrangians will be thus supposed without loss of generality to be quadratic at infinity .    the goal of the present work will be to see under which assumptions the existence of critical points for @xmath55",
    "is guaranteed .",
    "it is clear that in this study a crucial role will be played by the analytical ( e.g. boundedness ) and geometric properties ( e.g. the presence of a mountain - pass geometry ) of @xmath55 , as well as by the topological properties of the space @xmath56 .",
    "however , if on the one hand the topological properties of @xmath56 clearly do not depend on @xmath3 , on the other hand the properties of @xmath55 change drastically when crossing a suitable energy value .",
    "this is actually no surpise , since also the dynamical and geometric properties of the euler - lagrange flow change when crossing suitable _ ma critical values _",

    "for which @xmath3 is the functional @xmath55 bounded from below on the connected components of @xmath56 ? and for those values of @xmath3 , on which connected components of @xmath56 does then @xmath55 admit minimizers ? 2 .",
    "assume that the topology of @xmath56 ( or the geometry of @xmath55 ) allows to define a suitable minimax class . for which @xmath3 does this then yield existence of critical points for @xmath55 ?",
    "we shall however observe already at this point that a general existence result of critical points for @xmath55 can not be obtained , even if the energy is supposed to be in some sense `` high '' , since there are examples of euler - lagrange flows and of submanifolds @xmath17 for which there are no orbits satisfying the conormal boundary conditions .",
    "consider for instance the geodesic flow on the flat torus @xmath57 and pick @xmath17 as in the figure below        the conormal boundary conditions imply that geodesics connecting @xmath4 with @xmath5 have to hit both @xmath4 and @xmath5 orthogonally , which is not possible ( except for the constant solution in the intersection ) .",
    "it follows that for every @xmath58 there are no geodesics connecting @xmath4 with @xmath5 and satisfying the conormal boundary conditions . from a variational viewpoint ,",
    "what goes wrong in this example is that @xmath56 is connected , contractible and contains constant paths .",
    "this implies that @xmath55 has infimum zero on @xmath56 , for every @xmath58 , and this is not attained . also",
    ", one can not expect to find minimax critical points , since @xmath56 is contractible .",
    "this is however the only possible counterexample , at least if one assumes the energy @xmath3 to be `` sufficiently large '' as we now briefly explain .",

    "it is possible to show that , if @xmath68 , then @xmath55 is bounded from below on each connected component of @xmath56 and it is unbounded from below on each connected component otherwise . furthermore , for @xmath69 every palais - smale sequence for @xmath55 ( cf .",

    "the example above represents the only possible counterexample when the energy is supercritical .",
    "existence results for subcritical energies are harder to achieve than the corresponding ones for supercritical energies and the reason for that are of various nature .",
    "first , provides an obstruction to the existence of orbits satisfying the conormal boundary conditions , since we might expect existence only above a certain value of the energy , even if the submanifolds @xmath4 and @xmath5 intersect or if @xmath41 .",
    "second , when @xmath78 , @xmath55 could have palais - smale sequences with times going to infinity .",
    "in fact , the lack of the palais - smale condition for subcritical energies is ultimately responsible of the fact that one gets existence results which hold only for _ almost every energy _ in a suitable range of subcritical energies .",
    "finally , the problem becomes even harder if @xmath79 as it contains , as a very special case , the problem of finding the energy levels for which any couple of points in @xmath35 can be joined by an euler - lagrange orbit . in this direction",
    "it has been proven by mae in @xcite that , for every @xmath80 , every pair of points in @xmath35 can be joined by an euler - lagrange orbit .",
    "this result has been strenghten by contreras in @xcite to every @xmath81 . here",
    "@xmath82 , respectively @xmath83 , is defined as in replacing @xmath67 with the abelian cover of @xmath35 , respectively with the universal cover of @xmath35 , and is called the _ ma critical value of the abelian cover _",

    "one has therefore to assume that @xmath89 . in this introduction",
    "we suppose for sake of simplicity the intersection to be connected and the lagrangian @xmath10 to be of the form , even though these assumptions can be easily dropped .",
    "denote with @xmath70 the connected component of @xmath56 containing the constant paths and define the energy value @xmath90    the energy value @xmath91 might , but need not , coincide with @xmath92 ; examples will be provided in section [ counterexamples ] .",
    "furthermore , @xmath91 depends only on the local ( i.e. on the intersection ) behavior of the magnetic potential @xmath34 .",
    "the relevance of @xmath91 relies on the fact that , for @xmath93 the free - time action functional has a mountain - pass geometry on @xmath70 .",
    "the two valleys are represented by the set of constant paths and by the the set of paths with negative action ( which is non - empty as @xmath94 .",
    "this mountain - pass geometry allows to prove the following    for almost every @xmath93 there exists an euler - lagrange orbit in @xmath70 with energy @xmath3 which satisfies the conormal boundary conditions .",
    "[ teosubcriticalintro ]    the `` almost every '' relies exactly on the lack of the palais - smale condition for @xmath55 for subcritical energies . to overcome this difficulty one has to use an argument originally due to struwe @xcite , which has been already intensively applied to the existence of periodic orbits for subcritical energies @xcite , called the _ struwe monotonicity argument_.    as we will see in the section [ counterexamples ] , also the theorem above is sharp ; namely , for every @xmath84 we provide an example of magnetic lagrangian @xmath85 and of intersecting submanifolds such that the interval @xmath95 is non - empty and , for every @xmath96 , there are no euler - lagrange orbits with energy @xmath3 satisfying the conormal boundary conditions .",
