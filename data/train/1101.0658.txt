    "during the past decade the optical quantum memories have became one of the active areas of research in the field of quantum optics and quantum information ( see the reviews @xcite ) .",
    "such devices are considered as basic ingredient for scalable linear - optical quantum computers and efficient quantum repeaters . for practical quantum information applications ,",
    "it is necessary to develop memories which could store quantum states of light with close to 100% efficiency and fidelity , and provide long and controllable storage times or delay - bandwidth products . in this respect significant experimental progress has been achieved in demonstration of optical quantum storage using electromagnetically induced transparency @xcite , photon echo induced by controlled reversible inhomogeneous broadening @xcite or by atomic - frequency comb @xcite , and off - resonance raman interaction @xcite .",
    "optical quantum memories are usually assumed to store and recall optical pulses , such as single - photon wave packets , exploiting inhomogeneous broadened transitions or modulated control fields . in the present work we suggest one more possibility . by considering quantum storage based on off - resonant raman interaction , we show that manipulation of refractive index in a three - level resonant medium allows one to store and recall single - photon wave packets without using inhomogeneous broadening of the atomic transitions or manipulating the amplitude of the control field .",
    "a single - photon wave packet may be reversibly mapped to a superposition of atomic collective excitations with different wave vectors , which is analogues to that of orthogonal subradiant states created in an extended atomic ensemble @xcite .    as well as providing an interesting possibility for storage , the refractive index control may also be useful for optimizing multiplexing regimes of multimode quantum memories , development of which is important in the prospect of both quantum communication @xcite and computation @xcite . particularly , multimode memories can significantly increase the quantum communication rate for short storage times .",
    "different ways of multiplexing has been suggested @xcite , among which time domain multiplexing is currently most demanded from the view point of fiber optical communication .",
    "being combined with any approach to quantum storage mentioned above , the refractive index control provides an additional degree of freedom for multiplexing thereby improving capacity of a multimode quantum storage device or allowing operation in a multichannel regime .",
    "such a multiplexing method is closely connected with the angular @xcite or holographic @xcite ones since it also resorts to phase - matching conditions in an extended atomic ensemble , but it does not exploit different spatial modes of the field . in effect , the additional multiplexing capacity is based on the possibility to use frequency and wavelength of the field in a storage material as independent parameters .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we analyze the storage and retrieval of single - photon wave packets via refractive index control during off - resonant raman interaction . in sec .",
    "iii , suitability of refractive index control for developing multichannel quantum memories is discussed . in sec .",
    "iv , we consider possible ways of refractive index manipulation and some implementation issues .",
    "as a basic model we consider cavity - assisted quantum storage , which is motivated by the following reasons .",
    "first , enclosing an atomic ensemble in a cavity makes it possible to achieve high efficiency of quantum storage with optically thin materials",
    ". this may be especially useful for considered off - resonant raman interaction since the cross - section of the two - photon transition is usually small .",
    "second , there is no need for backward retrieval when optically thin materials are used , which relieves one of having to perform phase conjugation of the atomic states used for storage .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath0 identical three - level atoms which are placed in a single - ended ring cavity and interact with a weak quantum field ( single - photon wave packet ) to be stored and with a strong classical control field ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the atoms have a @xmath1-type level structure , the fields are raman resonant to the lowest ( spin ) transition , and the cavity is resonant to the quantum field .",
    "we assume that the atoms are not moving being impurities embedded in a solid state material .",
    "the interaction volume is supposed to have a large fresnel number , which allows us to take advantage of one - dimensional approximation .",
    "the hamiltonian of the three - level system in the dipole and rotating wave approximations is     ( color online ) schematic of a quantum memory device ( above ) and atomic level structure ( below ) .",
    "mirrors m2 and m3 are perfectly reflecting for the single - photon field and fully transmitting for the control field , m1 is a partially transmitting mirror .",
    "the difference of wave vectors @xmath2 is modulated via refractive index control during off - resonant raman interaction.,width=226 ]    @xmath3    where @xmath4 @xmath5 here @xmath6 are the atomic operators , @xmath7 is the @xmath8th state ( @xmath9 ) of @xmath10th atom with the energy @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) , @xmath13 is the position of the @xmath10th atom , @xmath14 is the photon annihilation operator in the cavity mode , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the wave vectors of the classical and quantum fields , respectively , @xmath17 and @xmath8 are refractive indices at the frequencies @xmath18 and @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the rabi frequency of the classical field , and @xmath21 is the coupling constant between the atoms and the quantized field mode .",
    "the values of @xmath17 and @xmath8 are considered below as parameters changing in time .",
    "since variations of them are supposed to be much less than 1 , we leave such time dependence only in phase factors and ignore it in the factors @xmath22 and @xmath21 as functions of refractive indices .    in the heisenberg picture , we define the following slowly varying atomic operators : @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and cavity field amplitude @xmath25 . from the input - output relations for the cavity field @xcite we have @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the cavity decay rate and @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) is the input ( output ) field ( a single - photon wave - packet ) . from the heisenberg ",

    "the wave vectors @xmath42 are multiples of @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the length of the atomic medium .",
    "the phase mismatching factors @xmath45 , which are usually ignored on the assumption that a single spatial mode of the spin coherence is excited and phase - matching is perfect , are now considered .",
    "suppose that we can manipulate the difference @xmath46 by refractive index control without changing frequencies and propagation directions of the interacting fields .",
    "we discuss possible ways of implementation below .",
    "for now it is sufficient to consider the case when one of the wave vectors , say @xmath47 of the control field , is changed linearly in time during the interaction so that @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the moment when @xmath50 for a given @xmath42",

    "( [ b1 ] ) we find @xmath68 equation ( [ c ] ) describes the mapping of an input single - photon wave packet to a superposition of collective excitations ( spin waves ) with different wave vectors .",

    "suppose , e.g. , that the time dependence of refractive index during the time interval @xmath72 $ ] , when @xmath73 , is reversed . in this case , instead of eq .",

    "( [ in_out ] ) we obtain @xmath76 the solution eq .",
    "( [ d ] ) is exactly the same as that in the cavity - assisted storage with inhomogeneous broadening @xcite .",
    "the output field becomes time - reversed replica of the input field provided that the duration of wave packet is much smaller that the decay time @xmath77 , and the efficiency of the storage followed by retrieval is maximum under impedance - matching condition @xmath78 .",
    "the only difference is the collective absorption / emission rate @xmath79 , which in our case takes the form @xmath80 it means that the time interval @xmath62 , which is actually the time interval between two adjacent orthogonal spin states created upon refractive index control , is analogous to inhomogeneous life - time , i.e. , reversal inhomogeneous linewidth .",
    "we see that a single - photon wave packet can be effectively stored and reproduced via refractive index control in a three - level system without inhomogeneous broadening and without modulating the rabi frequency of the control field during the interaction .",
    "it is also important that the time dependence of the refractive index need not be reversed during the retrieval . if the values of @xmath17 during retrieval are ordered like those during storage , eq .",
    "( [ d ] ) is replaced by @xmath81 thus a single - photon wave packet may be reconstructed without time reversal so that its temporal shape be not deformed by the rephasing process .    the total change of refractive index during storage or retrieval is @xmath82 where @xmath83 .",
    "numerics show that a gaussian pulse with the duration ( fwhm ) as short as @xmath84 can be stored and recalled with the efficiency 0.99 provided that @xmath85 is small enough ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "therefore , taking @xmath86 and @xmath87 we have @xmath88 , which may be considered as the minimum refractive index increment needed for storage of a single pulse under typical experimental conditions .",
    "the ratio between the total accessible range of refractive index change and this minimum value determines the number of pulses can be stored in a series , i.e. , the mode capacity of quantum memory .",
    "( color online ) storage and retrieval of a gaussian pulse for different values of @xmath62 .",
    "the black solid curve is the input pulse of duration @xmath89 .",
    "other curves represent the output field for the cases @xmath90 ( blue circles ) , @xmath91 ( green dashed line ) , @xmath92 ( red solid line ) .",
    "these curves were obtained by numerically solving eqs .",
    "( [ a1a ] ) and ( [ a2a ] ) , treated as complex number equations , with the condition @xmath78 and @xmath93 .",
    "the sign of @xmath94 is changed at the moment @xmath95.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ] ( 10,0)@xmath96 ( -200,120)@xmath97 , ( -200,110)a.u .",
    "( -150,110)input(-150,100)pulse    the impedance matching condition @xmath98 may be written in the following form : @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the cooperativity parameter , which could also be expressed in terms of the cavity finesse @xmath101 and resonant absorption coefficient @xmath102 as @xmath103 , provided that the resonant medium fills the cavity .",
    "thus to store and recall pulses broader than the raman linewidth @xmath85 , we need to increase @xmath104 above 1 appropriately .",
    "in general case , @xmath85 consists of homogeneous and inhomogeneous contributions . if we do nothing with the latter , the delay - bandwidth product of quantum storage ( or multimode capacity ) proves to be of the order of @xmath104 .",
    "it may be increased by choosing materials with a narrower line - width or shorter pulses with appropriate increasing the cooperative parameter .",
    "but if we are able to reverse the inhomogeneous broadening , the delay - bandwidth product may be increased significantly depending on a residual noncontrollable broadening , say @xmath105 , of the raman transition . as a result",
    ", the mode capacity of quantum storage may be @xmath104 times larger than that achievable without refractive index control , which is determined by the ratio @xmath106 .",
    "in the previous section , we were interested in the situation when the bandwidth of the photon is larger than the inhomogeneous linewidth of the raman transition .",
    "now we consider the opposite case , when the storage and retrieval are implemented , for example , by manipulating the inhomogeneous broadening , which should be larger than the photon bandwidth , and refractive index control is used for realizing multichannel regime of quantum storage .",
    "the idea is that different wave vectors of the spin waves correspond to different channels of storage and retrieval just as in the case of angular multiplexing .",
    "for example , consider the raman echo memory scheme with controlled reversible inhomogeneous broadening that is switched in time periodically @xcite .",
    "the multichannel regime can be achieved by assigning different wave vectors @xmath47 to the control field ( in our case  by refractive index control ) during different dephasing / rephasing circles . in a similar way",
    ", we can consider memory schemes based on resonant interaction .",
    "let the storage and retrieval be implemented using atomic frequency comb @xcite , which dephases and then rephases after a time @xmath107 , and @xmath108-pulses transferring the optical coherence to / from the spin coherence are used @xcite .",
    "then we can make different @xmath8 for different @xmath108-pulses thereby creating orthogonal spin waves on different storage / retrieval cycles or we can change refractive index for the weak field to be stored so that @xmath109 , which leads to the same result . in any case ,",
    "such multichannel regimes enable one to process new quantum states while preserving those stored before and provides access to all states kept in store in any order .",
    "it is also important that the phase modulation of the control field , which is required to store and recall pulses without resort to inhomogeneous broadening , becomes needless in the case of such channel division .",
    "regarding the impedance matching condition , it takes the form @xmath110 since @xmath111 is replaced by inhomogeneous life - time @xmath112 .",
    "apart from the finite storage time due to irreversible relaxation , the maximum number of channels is also limited by the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the latter can be estimated in the following simple way .",
    "consider two channels corresponding to wave vectors with the difference @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is an integer . during retrieval from one of them the probability of retrieval from another",
    "is determined by phase mismatching and proportional to @xmath115 ^ 2 $ ] , which may be equal to zero only for monochromatic field .",
    "now it is necessary to take into account the bandwidth @xmath116 of the retrieved signals ( here @xmath8 is the average value of refractive index during storage or retrieval ) .",
    "if @xmath117 , then @xmath118 ^ 2\\,dx=\\frac{1}{12}\\left[\\frac{\\delta\\omega}{\\omega}\\frac{l}{\\lambda}\\frac{n}{m}\\right]^2.\\ ] ] we see that the noise from another channel is quadratically proportional to the bandwidth of the photons @xmath119 and length of the sample @xmath44 . as an example",
    ", let @xmath120 , @xmath121 , and @xmath122 . if @xmath123 , then @xmath124 for @xmath125 so that 100 channels provide total signal - to - noise ratio of the order of 100 .",
    "in order to maintain this ratio for broader signals , the value of @xmath114 should be increased proportionally to the bandwidth , which means increasing refractive index difference between adjacent channels .",
    "let us discuss possible ways of refractive index manipulation that are suited to quantum storage devices .",
    "first , if a doped nonlinear crystal is used as a storage medium , we can take advantage of the linear electro - optic effect .",
    "for example , the maximum value of the index change in @xmath126 , which is limited by the breakdown electric field , is of the order of @xmath127 .",
    "although attaining this value by applying a moderate voltage is possible only for a waveguide configuration , the doped nonlinear materials , particularly @xmath128 , hold promise in quantum storage applications , and therefore traditional electro - optic techniques of refractive index manipulation might be of helpful .",
    "second , the resonant enhancement of the refractive index with vanishing absorption can be realized via quantum interference effects @xcite . although the maximum enhancement demonstrated experimentally in a gaseous medium",
    "is @xmath129 @xcite , there is good reason to expect much larger values , such as @xmath130 , for solid state materials @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that manipulating refractive index either on the frequency of the quantum field to be stored or on the frequency of the strong control field should not only guarantee small losses but also no amplification .",
    "one way of avoiding the gain is to use excited state absorption @xcite .",
    "finally , we would like to note that some possibilities of refractive index control are provided even by a frequency shift of an absorption structure relative to the @xmath1-type one . at cryogenic temperatures optical transitions of impurity crystals and especially of rare - earth ion - doped ones",
    "have very narrow homogeneous lines so that in the neighborhood of an inhomogeneous profile there might be rather strong frequency dependence of refractive index and yet very small absorption . in this respect",
    ", spectral hole - burning techniques can be very useful for preparing inhomogeneous profiles with sharp edges as well as for creating @xmath1-systems on a nonabsorbing background .",
    "a more detailed analysis of such an approach , which invokes specific information about resonant materials , will be presented elsewhere .",
    "it is shown that single - photon wave packets can be stored and recalled in a resonant three - level medium by means of refractive index control without recourse to inhomogeneous broadening and modulating the amplitude of control fields .",
    "such a scheme for quantum storage can be combined with other techniques to increase the mode capacity of quantum memories or to develop multichannel storage devices .",
    "although implementation of refractive index control is still a challenging experimental problem , we hope that significant progress can be made in this field by taking advantage of solid - state materials , which are also promising for quantum storage applications ."
