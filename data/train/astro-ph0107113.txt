    "since the discovery of tev @xmath3-rays from the bl lac objects , mrk  421 ( punch et al .",
    "1992 ) and mrk  501 ( quinn et al .  1996 ) , detailed very high energy observations of these nearby blazars ( z = 0.031 , z = 0.034 ) have been made .",
    "measurements of flux variation with time , particularly simultaneous measurements at several wavelengths , constrain models of particle acceleration and @xmath3-ray production in the jets .",
    "spectral energy density measurements constrain both the models of the jets and of the infra - red ( ir ) photon density in the intervening intergalactic medium .",
    "the possibility of absorption of @xmath3-rays by ir radiation has been predicted for some time ( see , e.g. , nikishov 1962 ; gould & schrder 1967 ; stecker , de jager & salamon 1992 ; biller et al .",
    "1998 ; vassiliev 1999 ) .    the general picture which has emerged for the spectral energy density of emitted radiation from bl lacs has two components , a lower one with energies extended up to about 100 kev attributed to synchrotron radiation from electrons , and a higher one with energies sometimes extending to the tev range , usually attributed to inverse compton scattering ( see , e.g. , maraschi , ghisellini & celotti 1992 , marscher & travis 1996 ) .",
    "there are also competing models ( mannheim & biermann 1992 ; mannheim 1993 ; mannheim 1998 ) which assume that the higher energy component arises from protons , either by proton - induced synchrotron cascades ( pic models ) or by decays and/or interactions of secondary particles such as neutral pions and neutrons , or synchrotron radiation from proton beams ( mcke & protheroe 2000 ; aharonian 2000 ) .",
    "see catanese and weekes ( 1999 ) and mukherjee ( 2001 ) for reviews of tev observations and an overview of relevant models .",
    "mrk 421 and mrk 501 are particularly useful in separating the spectral characteristics intrinsic to the object from absorption effects in the intervening medium because they have almost the same redshift .",
    "they also exhibit strong flares in the tev energy regime , well above typical quiescent levels , making detailed spectral measurements possible for both ( gaidos et al .",
    "1996 ; catanese et al .  1997 ; protheroe et al .  1997 ; aharonian et al .",
    ".    measurements by various tev astronomy groups have shown that the energy spectrum of mrk  501 is not a simple power law ( samuelson et al .",
    "1998 ; aharonian et al .  1999a ; djannati - ata et al .  1999 ; aharonian et al .  2001 ) but has significant curvature .",
    "the two - component nature of multiwavelength blazar spectra implies that , over a sufficiently wide energy range , tev spectra must be intrinsically curved .",
    "the measured curvature however depends on the distance of the energy range of the data from the ic peak . during the strong flaring activity the synchrotron peak of mrk  501 appears to shift to above 100  kev ( catanese et al . 1997 ; pian et al .",
    "1998 ) , with the ic peak shifting to several hundred gev ( samuelson et al . 1998 ) .",
    "measurements of the hegra collaboration have the highest energies extending to @xmath4  20  tev ; their spectrum is fit better with an exponential cutoff at @xmath5  tev ( aharonian et al .",
    "1999a ; aharonian et al . 2001 ) , rather than a simple parabolic correction to the power law as used in samuelson et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "several groups have determined energy spectra for mrk 421 , both at low average flux levels ( @xmath6 crab ) ( aharonian et al . 1999b ; krawczynski et al .",
    "2001 ; bazer - bachi et al . 2001 ) and from intense flares ( 2.8 - 7.4 crab ) ( zweerink et al .  1997 ; krennrich et al .",
    "analysis of the intense flare data showed that mrk  421 had a spectral index different from mrk  501 .",
    "the data could be acceptably fit with a simple power law , although there was weak evidence for curvature ( krennrich et al .",
    "the shape of the spectral energy distribution for mrk  421 ( aharonian et al .",
    "1999b ; krennrich at al 1999b ) and mrk  501 generally appears independent of the flux level ( aharonian et al .",
    "1999a ) , although some evidence for spectral variability has been reported by djannati - ata et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and krawczynski et al .",
    "( 2001 ) for mrk  501 .    in this letter",
    ", we present results from @xmath3-ray observations of mrk  421 taken during intense flares in january - march 2001 with the whipple observatory 10  m telescope yielding a spectrum spanning the energy range between 260  gev and 17  tev .",
    "the spectrum has high statistical precision and shows a distinct cutoff with a characteristic energy of about 3 - 6 tev .",
    "the observations were made with the whipple observatory 10  m @xmath3-ray telescope equipped with the granite - iii high resolution camera ( finley et al .",
    "the fine granularity ( @xmath7 ) of the 379 photomultiplier camera provides good sensitivity for point sources .",
    "the sensitive energy range of the instrument is @xmath8  200  gev to greater than 20  tev .",
    "based on finer sampling of @xmath3-ray images , the linear response of the telescope at the highest energies is improved in comparison with previous camera configurations .    the use of a different type of photomultiplier ( hamamatsu r-960 , previously hamamatsu r1398 ) , a complete re - coating of the mirrors and the installation of a new set of light concentrators necessitated a comprehensive and detailed new calibration of the telescope .",
    "three methods were used : the first was based on laboratory measurements of the individual instrument components , the second utilized the calibrated cherenkov light signal from single secondary cosmic - ray muons , and the third used simulated cosmic - ray showers to match observed distributions of the parameters of the background images .",
    "all three methods provide an energy calibration consistent within 20% for the absolute energy of primary @xmath3-rays .",
    "the calibration can be evaluated by checking the energy spectrum of the crab nebula , which is a standard candle for tev @xmath3-ray astronomy .",
    "the measurements of the spectrum of the crab nebula with the whipple telescope over several years data using different camera configurations , are all statistically consistent , showing the same flux constant and energy spectral index .",
    "therefore , we also show the crab spectrum in this paper for comparison with the mrk  421 spectrum .",
    "the crab data consist of 15.4 hours of on - source observations ( zenith angle @xmath9 ) with the same amount of data for the background estimate .",
    "mrk  421 was more active in 2000 and 2001 than in previous years of observations , with the most intense flaring episodes in 2001 .",
    "the unusually high flaring states in 2001 provide remarkable statistics , and we have chosen the strongest flares for the analysis of the spectral energy distribution .",
    "observations of flaring states on january  21 , january  31 , february  1 - 3 , february  27 , march  19 , march  21 , march  26 - 27 , 2001 provide together @xmath10 photons above 260  gev . to test the validity of combining various flares we have also divided the data into two subsets and found no statistical inconsistency in the derived energy spectral indices .",
    "the statistical significance of the excess events corresponds to more than 86 standard deviations .",
    "the selected 2001 flaring data consist of 30.8  hours of on - source observations at zenith angles less than @xmath11 . for background comparison",
    ", the same amount of off - source data is used from observations made at similar zenith angles .",
    "the on - source data provide an average rate of 12.5 @xmath12/min , corresponding to 3.7 crab .",
    "the excellent signal to background ratio can be seen from figure  1 .",
    "this plot shows the alpha distribution ( for explanation of alpha parameter see caption of figure 1 or reynolds et al .",
    "1993 ) of events with energies greater than 1  tev from the source ( solid line ) after applying @xmath3-ray selection criteria .",
    "the dotted line shows the corresponding distribution for the background measurements .    the data analysis , @xmath3-ray selection and energy estimate use the methods developed by mohanty et al .",
    "these @xmath3-ray selection criteria are derived from parameter distributions of simulated @xmath3-ray showers as a function of their total light intensity ( size ) in the camera .",
    "the criteria vary with size and are set so that they keep 90% of the @xmath3-ray images whose centroids lie within @xmath13 of the center of the camera . to avoid the difficulties of modeling the trigger electronics we apply an additional cut , requiring that a signal of at least 15.1 photo electrons ( p.e . ) , 13.6 p.e . and 12.1 p.e .",
    "be present in the three highest image pixels , respectively .",
    "the differential energy flux values derived from the intense flaring states of mrk  421 in 2001 , and for comparison the crab nebula , are shown in figure 2 .",
    "the spectrum of the crab nebula can be well fit by a power law of the form :    @xmath14    giving a @xmath15 of 6.9 for 10 degrees of freedom ( probability 73% ) .",
    "this result is consistent , within its limited statistics , with previous measurements made by the whipple collaboration ( hillas et al .",
    "1998 ; mohanty et al .",
    "1998 ; krennrich et al .",
    "1999a ) , showing that the analysis methods , the calibration of the detector , and the reconstruction of energy spectra are all consistent at the 2 sigma level including systematic uncertainties .",
    "the first set of errors on the measured spectral index are statistical and the second are systematic .",
    "the systematic errors are determined by varying the gain of the system by 20% , and by varying the cut efficiencies ( see mohanty et al .",
    "1998 ) .    fitting a power law to the energy distribution of mrk",
    "421 yields the following result :    @xmath16    giving a @xmath15 of 410.7 for 10 degrees of freedom .",
    "the spectrum is clearly not compatible with a simple power law form .",
    "a curvature fit for the mrk  421 spectrum yields :    @xmath17 @xmath18 .    giving a @xmath19 for 9 degrees of freedom with a chance probability of @xmath20 . as shown in figure 2 , the mrk  421 spectrum exhibits clear curvature , but a parabola is not a suitable shape .",
    "assuming that part of the curvature in the spectrum is due to a cutoff , the data can be fit by :    @xmath17 @xmath21    with @xmath22 .    while the @xmath15 ( 25.2 for nine degrees of freedom or a probability of 0.3% ) is not particularly good , the fit using an exponential cutoff is much better than the fits using the two simple forms considered above .",
    "we should point out here that for the first time statistical errors of the flux measurements in tev astronomy reached the level of 2% , likely making systematic uncertainties dominant . because of this , indicated confidence levels should be accepted with a caution as they are based only on statistics of detected photons .",
    "we have also examined the flux values at 5.6 and 8.2 tev , which appear high to the eye , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively above the exponential cutoff fit . considering the statistical uncertainties we do not regard this as a significant feature in the data . in future",
    ", a more complete analysis will be pursued to understand systematic errors at the percent level . in derivation of the cutoff energy we have included two most prominent sources of systematics : uncertainties in the reconstruction of the spectrum with a cutoff derived from simulation tests ( test spectra ) , and uncertainty in absolute energy calibration of the instrument ( 20% ) .",
    "we also tried a `` super - exponential '' form ( e.g. , see stecker , de jager & salamon 1992 ; aharonian et al .",
    "2001 ) , but with no improvement in quality of fit .",
    "the result is :    @xmath17 @xmath25    with @xmath26 .",
    "the @xmath15 of the fit is 24.0 for eight degrees of freedom ( probability of 0.2% ) .",
    "for the first time , the mrk  421 energy spectrum at very high energy has been determined over a sufficiently wide energy range , and with sufficient statistical precision , that an important feature ( a cutoff ) could be discerned .",
    "the spectrum is best described by a power law attenuated by an exponential cutoff at an energy of @xmath27  tev .",
    "the cutoff feature could have several origins , e.g. , the termination of the particle energy distribution in the primary beam , absorption near the @xmath3-ray source ( dermer & schlickeiser 1994 ) or absorption in intergalactic space by ir background radiation fields .",
    "if the cutoff energy varied in time , or differed for mrk  421 and 501 , it would not be due to extragalactic absorption .",
    "we examined our previous published flare spectra of mrk  421 ( krennrich et al .",
    "1999a ; zweerink et al .",
    "1997 ) and found them consistent with the present spectrum . fitting the previous mrk  421 spectrum ( krennrich et al .",
    "1999a ) with the parametrization of @xmath28 @xmath29 results in an acceptable @xmath15 of 19.4 for 13 degrees of freedom ( p = 11% ) .",
    "we also examined our previously published spectrum for mrk 501 ( samuelson et al . , 1998 ) and find that its spectrum can be fit by @xmath30 with @xmath31 .",
    "however , fitting the mrk 501 spectrum with @xmath28 @xmath32 results in a poor fit with a @xmath15 of 37.6 for 13 degrees of freedom ( p = @xmath33 ) .",
    "the cutoff energy for mrk  501 is consistent with the cutoff energy for mrk  421 , but a different spectral index is required for an acceptable fit .",
    "thus , we find no inconsistency with the assumption that the cutoff might be due to the ir background . more detailed studies of spectral variability of mrk  421 are in progress and will be presented elsewhere .",
    "energy spectra for mrk 421 reported by the hegra collaboration ( aharonian et al .",
    "1999b ) are based on data taken in 1997 and 1998 with the source at a lower average flux level ( @xmath34   crab ) . however , the primary sensitivity of the hegra array is at energies above 1  tev requiring a comparison above that energy .",
    "those results indicate a power law spectrum of @xmath35 .",
    "when the mrk 421 spectral data presented here are fit with a power law using only data points above 1  tev , a spectral index of @xmath36 with a @xmath15 of 106.8 for 6 degrees of freedom is measured ( @xmath37 if the 1.2  tev - 8.2  tev range is fitted , @xmath15 of 11.1 for 4 degrees of freedom ) which is consistent with the hegra result , considering statistical and systematic uncertainties between two different instruments .    in summary",
    ", we have presented a mrk  421 spectrum over the energy range 260  gev to 17 tev which shows an exponential - like cutoff in the range 3 - 6 tev , similar to the cutoff found earlier for mrk  501 ( see figure 3 ) which has almost the same redshift . the new mrk  421 spectrum is consistent with those reported earlier both by our group and others .",
    "the occurrence of a cutoff at similar energy in the very high energy spectra of the two equally distant @xmath3-ray blazars mrk  421 and mrk  501 might indicate that tev @xmath3-rays are absorbed by ir background radiation fields .",
    "future investigations regarding the implications for the energy density of extragalactic ir background radiation are underway ( vassiliev 2001 ) .",
