    "recent years have seen an enormous enhancement in the understanding of neutrino - oscillation parameters in accelerator - based experiments .",
    "these experiments are however confronted with a number of problems .",
    "these are related to the large systematic uncertainties associated with the neutrino - nucleus signal in the detector .",
    "major issues arise from the fact that the neutrino energy - flux in experiments is distributed over a wide range of energies from very low to a few gev .",
    "hence a number of nuclear effects over a broad kinematical range ( from low - energy nuclear excitations to multinucleon emission ) simultaneously come into play .",
    "the simulation codes used in the analysis of the experimental results are predominantly based on relativistic fermi gas ( rfg ) models .",
    "rfg can describe the quasielastic ( qe ) cross section sufficiently accurate for medium momentum ( @xmath2 500 mev / c ) transfer reactions , but its description becomes poor for low momentum ( @xmath3 300 mev / c ) transfer processes , where nuclear effects are prominent . for the broad neutrino energy - flux used in the experiments , more realistic models are required .    in this work",
    ", we present a self - consistent continuum random phase approximation ( crpa ) approach to calculate qe electron and neutrino - scattering cross - sections off the nucleus .",
    "this formalism was used to describe exclusive photo - induced and electron - induced qe scattering  @xcite , inclusive neutrino scattering at supernova energies  @xcite and charged - current quasielastic ( ccqe ) antineutrino scattering at intermediate energies  @xcite .",
    "we will briefly describe the essence of our model , for an updated version of the formalism we refer the reader to ref .",

    "@xcite , are the inclusion of relativistic corrections and a suppression of the rpa quenching at high @xmath4 .",
    "we start with a mean - field ( mf ) description of the nucleus where we solve the hartree - fock ( hf ) equations with a skyrme ( ske2 ) two - body interaction  @xcite to obtain the mf potential .",
    "we obtain the continuum wave functions by integrating the positive energy schrdinger equation with appropriate boundary conditions , hence taking into account final - state interactions in this manner .",
    "long - range correlations are implemented by means of a crpa approach based on a green s function formalism .",
    "the polarization propagator is approximated by iteration of its first - order contribution . in this way",
    ", the formalism takes into account one - particle one - hole excitations out of the correlated nuclear ground state . within the rpa",
    "an excited nuclear state is represented as the coherent superposition of the particle - hole ( @xmath5 ) and hole - particle ( @xmath6 ) excitations out of a correlated ground state @xmath7~,\\ ] ] where @xmath8 denotes all quantum numbers identifying an accessible channel .",
    "the rpa polarization propagator can be written as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the excitation energy of the nucleus and @xmath11 is a short - hand notation for the combination of spatial , spin and isospin coordinates .",
    "the @xmath12 corresponds to the mf contribution and @xmath13 is the antisymmetrized nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "we used the modified effective momentum approximation ( mema )  @xcite , in order to take into account the influence of the nuclear coulomb field on the ejected lepton . in order to prevent the ske2 force from becoming unrealistically strong at high virtuality @xmath14",
    ", we introduce a dipole hadronic form factor at the nucleon - nucleon interaction vertices  @xcite .",
    "further , we have implemented relativistic kinematic corrections  @xcite in an effective manner .",
    "we first test the reliability of the formalism by confronting ( @xmath0 ) scattering cross sections with the data of refs .",

    "it is interesting to note that in the very forward direction the crpa results are larger than the hf ones .",
