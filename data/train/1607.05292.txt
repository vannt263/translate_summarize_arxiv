    "recent multi - qubit experiments have reinforced the need to precisely characterize the dynamical processes governing emerging quantum computing devices @xcite . the convenient assumption that a qubit experiences only independent noise is rarely valid and capabilities to accurately differentiate between separable and correlated quantum dynamics is needed @xcite .",
    "the task of differentiating between two possible models for a quantum process can be cast as a decision problem in the context of statistical hypothesis testing @xcite . in general ,",
    "channel discrimination selects a model for an underlying dynamical process by inferring the completely - positive , trace - preserving map that takes a set of known input states to a set of measured output states .",
    "measurements of the output state indirectly reveal characteristics of the cptp map that can be used to discriminate between different potential models .",
    "previously , quantum process tomography ( qpt ) has been used to completely characterize and , therefore , discriminate one- and two - qubit channels using full reconstruction of the governing quantum process @xcite . however",
    ", this complete form of qpt quickly becomes intractable for higher dimensional systems because the number of required measurements scales exponentially with the system size .",
    "several alternative characterization methods have emerged to address the outstanding challenges of qpt .",
    "this includes randomized benchmarking , which reports an averaged fidelity for known gates @xcite , and gate - set tomography , which requires even more measurements than standard qpt @xcite . while these methods are operationally more robust for channel characterization , they are not intended for efficient channel discrimination .",
    "complete reconstruction of a quantum process is not generally necessary for purposes of channel discrimination . indeed",
    ", relatively few measurements may suffice to decide between different models for a set of observed behaviors .",
    "this is especially relevant for multi - qubit models , where exhaustive measurements are intractable but _ a priori _ information about the expected dynamics may be available .",
    "we address channel discrimination in this context by using selective process tomography .",
    "in particular , we leverage recent advances in the direct characterization of the quantum dynamics ( dcqd ) to impose the structure of quantum error detection codes on the task of discriminating between different channel models .",
    "as shown previously , dcqd allows for selective retrieval of tomographic information characterizing a quantum process @xcite .",
    "initially , dcqd was shown to enable piece - wise reconstruction of a channel by directly measuring elements of the underlying process matrix .",
    "this idea method was later extended to simultaneously encode logical qubits while performing tomographic measurements @xcite .",
    "more recently , the inclusion of error detection techniques was shown to further improve estimation of the process matrix elements in the presence of quantum noise @xcite .",
    "we show that selective characterization of an unknown process matrix using dcqd is sufficient to perform channel discrimination .",
    "in addition , we show that dcqd codes afford a natural and transparent framework for this task while also increasing the resiliency to unknown ( i.e. , not modeled ) channel noise .",
    "we illustrate these points using numerical simulations of multi - qubit dynamical processes under the influence of correlated and uncorrelated noise models .",
    "in particular , we consider the case of discriminating between a coherent entangling channel and its noisy equivalent .",
    "we also treat the case of selecting between incoherent correlated dynamics and an identical , independent noise model .",
    "for both examples , we confirm that selective process tomography is sufficient to discriminate the correct channel with very high probability at low false alarm rate .",
    "the latter quantities relate the performance of the protocol to operational goals .",
    "the remainder of this work is organized as follows : in sec .  [",
    "sec : dcqd ] we introduce the direct characterization methods employed to perform selective process tomography . next we formulate statistical estimation and inference tests taking the select tomographic data as input .",
    "[ sec : cxtheta ] introduces a specific example of a cnot gate parameterized by an angle @xmath0 quantifying the amount of entanglement which can be generated by the gate .",
    "we numerically simulate the estimation protocol and detail the statistical process underpinning the hypothesis testing protocol .",
    "we further explore the efficiency of the protocol in the presence of noisy quantum sources and investigate noise filtering using quantum error detection protocols .",
    "next , in sec .",
    "[ sec : correlated ] we explicitly address another example , namely that of estimating the degree of correlation present in a two - qubit incoherent noise source . we develop a model for the correlated noise and show that a two - qubit correlated channel can be detected , even in the presence of single qubit noise sources .",

    "( alternatively a pure state @xmath1 ) for the pure and ancilla systems evolves under an unknown channel @xmath2 .",
    "channel discrimination selects between possible models for the channels , e.g. , @xmath3 .",

    "the one - to - one correspondence between the located error operators and the syndromes means that the code is non - degenerate with respect to the set of located errors .",
    "the [ [ 4,0,2 ] ] qubit syndromes are generalized to [ [ 6,0,2 ] ] qubit syndromes by the addition of the parenthesis terms as described in ref .  .",
    "unlike the errors in this table , the syndromes for weight one operators with support on the ancilla system ( @xmath9 ) begin with either @xmath10 or @xmath11 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : located_errors ]    we outline the basic theory underpinning the tomography based channel discrimination scheme .",
    "the central concepts presented include a ) dcqd - style selective process tomography , b ) model - specific parameter estimation , and c ) statistical hypothesis testing .",
    "the dcqd protocol enables direct experimental characterization of unknown process matrix elements @xcite .",
    "underlying this idea is the choi - jamiokowski isomorphism between @xmath12-dimensional channels and @xmath13 dimensional states , which allows one to directly associate experimental measurement probabilities with process matrix elements .",
    "consequently , performing dcqd tomographic measurements on an @xmath14 qubit system requires a minimum of @xmath15 qubits .",
    "the first @xmath14 qubits form the principal system * p * to be characterized while the remaining qubits represent an ancilla system * a * used for measurements . focusing on a two - qubit channel , consider the composite system to consist of four qubits .",
    "an example of the corresponding dcqd protocol for the two - qubit channel is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] .",
    "all of the qubits are initialized into a maximally entangled state with respect to the principal - ancilla bipartition , i.e. , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 runs over the @xmath14 qubit basis set .",
    "we assume that the initial state preparation is ideal and the density operator representation of the initial state is @xmath18 .",
    "it is important to note that the state @xmath19 represents the one - dimensional codespace for a stabilizer code .",
    "for example , the state @xmath20 is the code state of the [ [ 4,0,2 ] ] error detecting code .",
    "the [ [ 4,0,2 ] ] code is defined by the stabilizer group @xmath21 } = { \\langle}xixi , ixix , zizi , iziz{\\rangle}$ ] , where @xmath22 denote the single - qubit pauli bit and phase flip operators and @xmath19 is expressed in the computational basis .",
    "more generally , the @xmath15-qubit dqcd code is generated by a group of stabilizer elements with each element having a matching support on one qubit from both the principal and ancilla systems . to simplify notation",
    "we perform a unitary rotation to the stabilizer basis which is indexed by an integer representation of the error syndrome ( i.e. @xmath6 for @xmath23 in the pauli group supported by the principal system , see also tab .  [",
    "tab : located_errors ] ) . in the stabilizer basis",

    "the output state in the stabilizer basis , @xmath26 , highlights the connection between the process matrix representation and the dcqd code space .",
    "stabilizer measurements project the composite system into the subspaces indexed by the stabilizer error syndromes @xmath27 where @xmath28 refers to a state belonging to the @xmath29 eigenspaces of the generator @xmath30 .",
    "stabilizer measurements that correspond to the state @xmath17 occur with probability @xmath31 and characterize the diagonal of @xmath32 in the stabilizer basis . by comparison ,",
    "the off - diagonal elements of the process matrix may be recovered by applying a ( two - local ) unitary or projection operator to the output state @xmath33 before the stabilizer measurements . this extra rotation or projective measurement maps the off - diagonal @xmath32 elements onto the diagonal , which may then be extracted by direct measurement in the stabilizer basis .",
    "additional details regarding these dcqd measurements have been presented previously in refs .  .",
    "we use the dcqd framework as a tool for discriminating between a pair of quantum channels .",
    "the first step in comparing two models is to expand each candidate channel in terms of its process matrix representation .",
    "we assume the models are parameterized by a quantity of interest which is to be estimated by model - specific process tomography . the representation of the process matrix for a channel can have many terms that vanish ( or are independent of the channel being identified ) with the parameter of interest appearing in relatively few terms .",
    "knowledge assumed for the model of the channel reduces the resources needed to perform channel discrimination , in contrast to the exponential resources necessary for complete tomography of an unspecified model . unlike arbitrary assumptions , knowledge about the expected channel behavior may be inferred from composing constituent parts or from indirect characterization of the system .",
    "in general there are many ways to probe a specific parameter .",
    "furthermore , the various measurement probabilities ( i.e. stabilizer measurements after possible unitary rotations or projectors are applied ) will depend differently on the parameter .",
    "this leads us to emphasize that it is important to maximize the sensitivity of the measurements depending on the parameter being estimated .",
    "we minimize the estimator variance , calculated using the cramer - rao lower bound , by picking a measurement set which maximizes the fisher information .",
    "given a measurement scheme it remains to collect data from syndrome measurements and estimate the parameter .",
    "there is freedom in how to estimate the model parameter(s ) , and we compare two different estimation techniques for the different examples presented below .",
    "we use the maximum likelihood ( ml ) estimator to find the parameter that maximizes the likelihood function of the observed data in parameter space for the case of the noisy entangling channel . for the incoherent noise model ,",
    "we develop analytic expressions that relate syndrome frequency directly to the parameter of interest , which we denote as a direct estimator .",
    "while the latter analytic estimation avoids the use of maximization searching ( which may fail due to local maxima ) , we find that finite sampling can also lead to an unphysical parameter estimate , e.g. a negative probability .",
    "we resolve this inconsistency by simply mapping all unphysical estimates to the physical estimates in an ad - hoc manner .",
    "we find this approach works quite well in the context of correlated channel discrimination .",
    "parameterization by a continuous variable generates an infinite set of channels which we partition into either _",
    "null _ or _ alternative _ classes of channels . for example , in sec .",
    "[ sec : correlated ] we ask if a two - local gate induces correlated bit - flip errors on the qubits supporting the gate",
    ". the answer must either be i ) yes ",
    "the gate induces correlated errors  or ii ) no  the noise is of a local form . from the point of view of channel discrimination ,",
    "the exact magnitude of the errors is not the main quantity of interest .",
    "this leads to the question of given a parameter estimate , how should one decide to accept or reject the alternative hypothesis in favor of the null case ?",
    "the answer is that the decision should be statistically motivated as explained below .",
    "statistical inference from experimental data is common in channel discrimination and in general statistical decision theory .",
    "the wald test is a parametric statistical test applicable to continuous variables ( our unknown parameters will be come from a continuous space ) which we will use to test the true value of a parameter based on a sample data .",
    "the univariate wald statistic is given as @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 is our estimator , @xmath36 is the parameter value under the null hypothesis , and the denominator is the variance of the estimator .",

    "[ fig : failprob ] . however , a notable difference between the two is that for coherent rotation estimation the amplitude was more detrimental discrimination ( @xmath198 increased more quickly for @xmath194 ) while for the bit flip example the situation is reversed with the depolarizing channel leading to a greater failure rate .",
    "the explanation for this behavior is that the depolarizing channel increases the individual bit flip rates across all qubits which directly biases the correlated bit flip parameter rate .",
    "on the other hand the amplitude damping channel affects other elements of the system density matrix which are not directly probed by the measurements we consider .",
    "also similarly to the last section , the intuition behind the increase of @xmath95 is that noisy channels modify the underlying stabilizer probabilities from the known null hypothesis probability distribution to one which resembles that of a finite @xmath136 thus biasing the estimator and increasing @xmath95 . after seeing that noise biases @xmath136 estimates upwards , it is also interesting to see how simple error detection mitigates the effects of noise .",

    "the results of this encoding are qualitatively similar to those in the last section , however the bias reduction in this case is clearly more pronounced especially in the case of the noisy ad channels as seen in panel ( a ) .",
    "we have presented a general and intuitive theory for quantum channel discrimination based on selectice process tomography within the framework of direct characterization of quantum dynamics .",
    "this approach avoids the complete characterize of the quantum channel required by qpt for purposes of discrimination .",
    "the main steps in the protocol include postulating ( parameterized ) models for the quantum channel and then selecting between these choices by comparing estimates for the model parameters .",
    "the estimates are efficient as they do not require complete tomographic reconstruction of the channel .",
    "moreover , we have shown how unknown source of noise may bias these estimates and how the ability for dcqd codes to improve estimation lead to improved channel discrimination .",
    "we have explicitly validated these ideas for imperfect entangling operations and for a crosstalk model involving correlated bit flips noise induced by entangling operations .",
    "numerical simulations showed that accurate channel discrimination and parameter estimation are indeed possible , given the test statistic distribution for a detection event lies above a critical threshold value .",
    "this is always guaranteed in the asymptotic limit of infinite measurements , but we have also shown the capabilities for discrimination using finite numbers of measurements . while our simulations were made for a two - qubit principal systems , the theory itself applies to the discrimination of general multi - qubit channels .",
    "the effects of unknown sources of quantum noise on discrimination have also been studied .",
    "we used amplitude damping and depolarizing channels to quantify the bias in model parameter estimates as well as the probability of an incorrect decision .",
    "in general , the addition of unknown noise is harmful to the protocol as the probability of selecting the wrong underlying model increased as a function of the noise magnitude .",
    "however , for the case of correlated bit - flip errors a single layer of dcqd error detection was shown to reduce the false alarm rate at low noise magnitudes .",
    "this result suggests that some dcqd parameter estimators are more sensitive to channel noise .",
    "further , the development of an entirely self - consistent procedure to estimate specific elements of a process matrix ( but not the full map ) in the presence of unknown noise is deferred to future work .",
    "it is possible to extend the ideas presented here by repeating the channel multiple times before performing syndrome measurements .",
    "this is similar to the approach taken in randomized benchmarking and gate - set tomography methods , where iterations of a gate effectively enhances its magnitude @xcite .",
    "for example , repeated over - rotations constitute a model with a large rotation that may be more easily estimated .",
    "in addition , this repetition would minimize the relative influence of state preparation and measurement ( spam ) errors , which act only once and independently from the number of repetitions .",
    "this approach may directly tackle the issue of spam errors , which has not been addressed in this work ; although the topic was partially addressed for systematic preparation and measurement errors , in an earlier work @xcite .",
