    "in his ground - breaking 1905 paper on brownian motion @xcite , einstein noticed that the same random thermal forces from the suspending medium that cause the diffusive motion of the particle , also produce the friction experienced by the particle when pulled through the same fluid medium . from this observation ,",
    "einstein was able to use statistical mechanics to derive the fluctuation - dissipation relation @xmath10 between the diffusion constant @xmath11 , friction coefficient @xmath12 , temperature @xmath1 , and the boltzmann constant @xmath13 .",
    "three years later , langevin introduced a very different approach to describe brownian motion @xcite .",
    "in contrast to einstein , who considered the focker - plank equation governing the particle s probability distribution , langevin focused on the particle s equation of motion @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the mass of the particle and @xmath16 is its velocity .",
    "the langevin equation describes newtonian dynamics under the influences of three forces : ( i ) a deterministic force @xmath2 , ( ii ) a friction force @xmath17 proportional to the velocity with friction coefficient @xmath18 , and ( iii ) a stochastic force @xmath19 representing fluctuations arising from interactions with the embedding medium that produces the friction .",
    "the stochastic force can be conveniently modeled by a delta - correlated ( `` white '' ) gaussian noise with statistical properties @xcite : @xmath20 where @xmath21 means a statistical average .",
    "this statistical definition of @xmath19 ensures that the motion satisfies einstein s fluctuation - dissipation relation , as can be easily realized by considering the overdamped limit of eq .",
    "( [ eq : lang ] ) for a flat potential ( @xmath22 ) . in this limit",
    ", the langevin equation simplifies to @xmath23 and by integrating the equation over time and using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : noise1 ] ) and ( [ eq : noise2 ] ) , one finds that the displacement of the particle satisfies @xmath24 , and @xmath25 with @xmath26 , as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fdr ] ) .",
    "langevin s work began a new field in mathematics that deals with stochastic differential equations , namely equations in which one ( or more ) of the terms is a stochastic process .",
    "stochastic differential equations require their own new calculus .",
    "the two most common versions of stochastic calculi were proposed and developed by it @xcite and stratonovich @xcite .",
    "the difference between them arises in equations with multiplicative noise , e.g. , in eq .",
    "( [ eq : browneq ] ) with a coordinate - dependent friction coefficient @xmath0 . in order to calculate the particle s trajectory",
    ", one needs to integrate eq .",
    "( [ eq : browneq ] ) over a time interval @xmath8 @xcite . for a uniform @xmath12 ,",
    "the integral over the stochastic noise is a well - defined wiener process @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a standard gaussian random number satisfying @xmath29 for a non - uniform @xmath0 , the integral is ill - defined , since one needs to specify both the trajectory and at which points along the trajectory the friction coefficient in eq .",
    "( [ eq : weiner ] ) is evaluated . in the it convention @xcite ,",
    "the friction coefficient is taken at the beginning of the time interval , while the stratonovich convention considers the algebraic mean of the initial and final frictions @xcite ( which , for a small time interval , can be considered close to the friction at the mid - point ) .",
    "another commonly used convention is due to hnggi @xcite .",
    "the latter uses the value of the friction coefficient at the end of the time interval . in ordinary differential equations ,",
    "all the above conventions result in similar trajectories when the time step becomes infinitesimal .",
    "however , the wiener process is non - differentiable and , therefore , for the stochastic equation ( [ eq : browneq ] ) , the different calculi lead to _ different _ results of @xmath30 for arbitrarily small integration time steps ( see ref .",
    "@xcite , section 3.3.3 ) .",
    "the resulting ambiguity about the appropriate way to interpret eq .",
    "( [ eq : weiner ] ) is known as the it - stratonovich dilemma @xcite .",
    "remarkably , it is in fact the hnggi convention that yields the correct equilibrium distribution of the particle at constant @xmath1 @xcite , which is the reason why this interpretation is also known as the `` isothermal '' convention .    diffusion in a medium with spatially dependent friction coefficient raises yet another serious problem concerning the validity of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "can one simply generalize eq .",
    "( [ eq : fdr ] ) and write that @xmath31 , and what is the physical meaning of a coordinate dependent diffusion coefficient ? @xcite the problem lies in the fundamental difference between friction and diffusion .",
    "the former is a quantity that can be defined locally by considering the motion of a particle in a flat potential at zero temperature . setting @xmath22 and @xmath32 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lang ] ) , and integrating the equation over the time interval @xmath8 , leads to @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 denote the displacement and the change in velocity , respectively .",
    "thus , @xmath36 can be defined as the limiting value of @xmath37 , the ratio between the change in momentum and displacement .",
    "in contrast to the friction coefficient , the diffusion constant is not a local quantity , but is rather defined by the long time asymptote of eq .",
    "( [ eq : diffusion ] ) . as the particle diffuses away from the point of origin",
    ", it explores new parts of the system and experiences a varying friction coefficient . for a general friction function @xmath0 ,",
    "it is not a - priory clear why the mean squared displacement should even grow linearly with @xmath38 , as implied by eq .",
    "( [ eq : diffusion ] ) . recently , for instance , it has been argued that certain functional forms of @xmath0 yield anomalous diffusion where @xmath39 with @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the problem can not be dealt with by considering short time dynamics where the particle remains close to the initial coordinate .",
    "( [ eq : diffusion ] ) is relevant only on time scales much larger than the relaxation time @xmath41 , whereas on shorter time scales the motion of the particle is ballistic and does not obey eq .",
    "( [ eq : diffusion ] ) at all ( not even for a uniform @xmath12 ) @xcite .",
    "these considerations suggest that the concept of spatially dependent diffusion constant is somewhat ambiguous , and that an alternative formulation for the fluctuation - dissipation relation must be sought for .    in this paper",
    "we generalize the fluctuation - dissipation relation to systems with non - uniform friction coefficients .",
    "the discussion extends our previous study on the it - stratonovich dilemma , in which we focused on the `` spurious drift '' ( see section [ sec : spurforce ] below for an explanation of this term ) of a particle in the presence of a friction gradient @xcite .",
    "our treatment is based on the full intertial langevin equation ( [ eq : lang ] ) , and we highlight the fact that the friction ( dissipation ) and noise ( flucutuation ) terms in this equation are governed by slightly different friction coefficients .",
    "we reintroduce our new `` inertial '' convention , which has been developed based on the analysis of eq .",
    "( [ eq : lang ] ) , and which employs different friction coefficients for the fluctuation and dissipation contributions . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we found both the inertial and isothermal conventions to produce the most accurate distribution functions when implemented in langevin dynamics simulations . here ,",
    "we demonstrate that the former outperform the latter in cases when the friction coefficient changes very rapidly .",
    "we use the simulations to verify the validity of the newly derived fluctuation - dissipation relationship , as well as of other theorertical predictions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : theory ] we derive expressions for the drift ( and the associated `` spurious force '' ) experienced by a particle when traveling in a medium with spatially dependent friction coefficient .",
    "we also present a generalized form for the fluctuation - dissipation relation .",
    "the derived expressions are tested and validated computationally in section [ sec : simulations ] , where we present our method for langevin dynamics simulations .",
    "the results are summarized and discussed in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "when a particle diffuses in a flat potential in a medium with constant @xmath12 , the mean displacement of the particle ( averaged over an ensemble of stochastic trajectories or , equivalently , an ensemble of particles ) vanishes : @xmath24 . in the presence of a friction gradient , the mean displacement does not vanish : @xmath42 - a phenomenon that has been termed `` spurious drift '' .",
    "the drift , which is in the opposite direction to the friction gradient , is , of course , not spurious , but rather represents the effect of inertia .",
    "it originates from the fact that when the particle travels toward a less viscous regime ( i.e. , against the friction gradient ) , it suffers less dissipation and therefore travels longer distances .",
    "this inertial effect is countered by a `` trapping effect '' that takes place on time scales larger than the ballistic relaxation time @xmath41 , and which has precisely the same origin , namely the fact that the ballistic distance decreases with @xmath12 . at the large time scales ,",
    "the larger friction slows down the diffusion of the particle and , thus , traps it in the more viscous regime . in the case of a flat potential ,",
    "the equilibrium distribution of the particle [ which is independent of @xmath0 ] is uniform , which means that , on average , the particle spends the same amount of time in each part of the system .",
    "this implies that the drift , which favors the low viscosity regime , precisely balances the slower diffusion on the high viscosity end .",
    "since the drift is an inertial effect , it must be dealt with within the framework of the full inertial langevin equation ( [ eq : lang ] ) , and not by using its strictly overdamped , non - inertial form eq .",
    "( [ eq : browneq ] ) .",
    "assuming a flat potential ( @xmath22 ) , and integrating eq .",
    "( [ eq : lang ] ) over the time interval from @xmath44 to @xmath45 , we arrive at the `` integrated langevin equation '' @xmath46 the terms on the r.h.s .  of eq .",
    "( [ eq : intlang ] ) , which give the friction and noise contributions to the change in the momentum , are governed by two distinct friction coefficients representing different averages of the friction function during the time interval .",
    "the friction term features the spacially averaged friction coefficient , @xmath47 @xmath48 where @xmath6 is the primitive function of @xmath0 .",
    "the spatially averaged friction coefficient , @xmath47 , has the following properties : ( i ) it depends on the initial and final coordinates , but not on the trajectory @xmath30 between them .",
    "( ii ) it is a well defined quantity that exists even if @xmath0 is discontinuous .",
    "( iii ) for smooth friction functions and sufficiently small @xmath49 , @xmath47 is well approximated by the stratonovich friction coefficient @xmath50 the noise term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : intlang ] ) is governed by a different friction coefficient .",
    "this term represents a sum of random gaussian variables with vanishing correlation time .",
    "therefore , it can be _ formally _ written as an integral of a wiener process [ compare with eq .",
    "( [ eq : weiner ] ) ] @xmath51 where @xmath28 is a standard gaussian random variable [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : standard ] ) ] , and @xmath52 is the time - averaged friction coefficient .",
    "in contrast to @xmath47 , which depends only on the end points of the interval , the calculation of @xmath53 requires full knowledge of the trajectory , @xmath30 , during the time step . without this information , @xmath53 can not be uniquely determined since there exists not just one path , but a distribution of possible trajectories , leading from @xmath4 to @xmath54 .",
    "this is the origin of the it - stratonovich dilemma .",
    "while eq .",
    "( [ eq : tfriction ] ) is formally correct , it bears no physical meaning for non - zero time steps as it is based on the assumption that the noise is temporally uncorrelated ( white ) , which is only true for vanishing @xmath8 . for time steps @xmath55 , the friction gradient colors the noise , since the noise value at one time instance changes the trajectory of the particle and , thereby , influences the noise statistics at a following instance in time .    to address the above problem and make eq .",
    "( [ eq : intlang ] ) physically unambiguous , we need to consider the ensemble average over all possible trajectories starting at @xmath4 , rather than a single path of the particle . on the l.h.s .  of eq .",
    "( [ eq : intlang ] ) we have the change in the momentum of the particle which , in the absence of deterministic forces ( @xmath22 ) , must have a vanishing ensemble average . on the r.h.s .",
    "we have the friction and noise forces . in accordance with einstein s idea , these terms arise from the random forces caused by the collisions with the molecules of the thermal bath .",
    "the collisions occur at such a fast rate that it can be assumed that the particle barely moves before experiencing enough collisions to make the central limit theorem applicable ( see discussion in section 4.5 of ref .",
    "thus , the total change in the momentum of the particle during an arbitrarily small time step is normally distributed .",
    "the friction force represents the mean rate of change in the momentum , while the noise accounts for the statistical fluctuations around the mean and , therefore , has a vanishing ensemble average at each instance during the time interval @xmath8 .",
    "this implies that the ensemble average of the change in the momentum due to the noise must vanish @xmath56 and this feature must be incorporated in the integral form of the langevin equation ( [ eq : intlang ] ) to make it consistent with the fluctuation - dissipation relationship .",
    "that leaves us with only the friction term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : intlang ] ) whose ensemble average must therefore also vanish , and by using eq .",
    "( [ eq : rfriction ] ) we conclude that the drift satisfies @xmath57 notice that eq .",
    "( [ eq : drift ] ) holds for any time interval @xmath58 ( i.e. , both in the ballistic and diffusive regimes ) , for as long as @xmath22 . for a constant @xmath12 it reduces to the no - drift condition : @xmath59 .    as noted above",
    ", the drift does not arise from the action of any real force but rather from the friction gradient . using eq .",
    "( [ eq : expansion ] ) in ( [ eq : drift ] ) we arrive at @xmath60 the associated spurious force is defined as the force generating a similar drift in a uniform medium . at short time",
    "scales , @xmath61 , the motion of the particle is ballistic ( @xmath62 ) and , thus , @xmath63 , where the second equality is obtained by virtue of the equilibrium maxwell - boltzmann velocity distribution .",
    "we thus conclude that in the ballistic regime , the drift is given by @xmath64 which resembles the inertial newtonian dynamics of a particle under the action of a ( spurious ) force @xmath65    on time scales much larger than the ballistic correlation time , @xmath66 , the motion must be compared to the diffusive dynamics of a particle in a uniform medium .",
    "for such a particle @xmath67 , and by inserting this relationship into eq .",
    "( [ eq : fricgrad ] ) , we arrive at the following expression for the `` spurious velocity '' ,",
    "@xmath68 @xmath69 this result can be compared to the velocity of a particle dragged by a ( spurious ) force of magnitude @xmath70 in a liquid with friction coefficient @xmath12 .",
    "remarkably , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : spuriousf1 ] ) and ( [ eq : spuriousf2 ] ) provide identical expressions for the spurious force at both the short- and long - time limits , representing both ballistic and diffusive behavior .",
    "notice that the spurious force calculation derived here is based on a first order expansion of @xmath0 in @xmath49 [ eq .  ( [ eq : expansion ] ) ] , which is only valid for smoothly varying friction and requires that the variation in @xmath0 during the time interval is relatively small ( @xmath71 , i.e. , a weak spurious force ) .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation in the short - time ballistic regime , but may be questionable in the diffusive time - scale . in what follows ( see especially section [ sec : dfr ] and the results in fig .  [",
    "fig : step ] ) , we will go beyond this approximation and allow larger variations in @xmath0 .",
    "part of the renewed interest in the it - stratonovich dilemma stems from the relevance of the topic to experiments involving femto - newton force measurements @xcite .",
    "when the particle under investigation is found close to the surface of the sample cell , its diffusion coefficients parallel and perpendicular to the boundary decrease due to the hydrodynamic interactions between the surface and particle . in light of the debate that has erupted about the interpretation of the results of such experiments @xcite , we here use our formalism to derive a new expression relating the displacement and the deterministic force acting on the particle .",
    "since it is impossible to address the force variations on time scales smaller than the measurement interval @xmath8 , we will assume that the force @xmath2 is constant during this time frame .",
    "without any further assumptions , we start with eq .",
    "( [ eq : intlang ] ) , but now in the presence of a constant deterministic force @xmath2 , and we take the ensemble average of the different terms . using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : rfriction ] ) and ( [ eq : zeronoise ] ) we arrive at @xmath72 in section [ sec : spurforce ] we argued that for @xmath22 , there can be no change in the ( ensemble ) average momentum of the particle , which means that the l.h.s .  of eq .",
    "( [ eq : intlang2 ] ) must vanish for any @xmath8 .",
    "this is obviously not true when @xmath73 since the force results in a change in the momentum .",

    "we conclude with the highlights of the study :    1 .  when a particle diffuses in a medium with spatially dependent friction coefficient",
    ", it exhibits a drift toward the low - friction end .",
    "the drift represents an inertial effect originating from the fact that when the particle travels toward a less viscous side , it suffers less dissipation and therefore travels longer distances .",
    "the drift counters the tendency of the particle to get trapped , due to slower diffusivity , in the more viscous parts of the system .",
    "the total amount of time spent by the particle in each part of the system is , obviously , independent of @xmath0 and depends only on the potential energy ( via the equilibrium distribution ) .    2 .",

    "while the former equation of motion is simply newton s second law with friction and noise , the latter equation is non - physical since it allows the velocity to diverge for an impulse of gaussian white noise .",

    "the dilemma is merely an artifact of the excessively simplified form eq .",
    "( [ eq : browneq ] ) . with the full langevin equation , all the conventions of assigning a value for the friction coefficient would yield statistically similar trajectories in the limit when the time step @xmath143 .",
    "this leaves us with the `` lighter version '' of the dilemma concerning the convention with the best rate of convergence , which is an important computational issue .",
    "we found the gjf integrator with the new inertial convention to be the best method for langevin dynamics simulations .",
    "the method produces accurate thermodynamic behavior at large times for relatively large integration time steps , even in systems with very rough friction landscapes .",
    "the success of the method can be attributed in part to the merits of the gjf integrator ( which produces correct thermodynamic response for constant @xmath12 @xcite ) , and in part to the fact that the inertial convention uses two different friction coefficients : @xmath47 and @xmath53 .",
    "the former of the two friction coefficients governs the dissipative component of the integrated langevin equation ( [ eq : intlang ] ) , and the latter sets the amplitude of the stochastic noise . while expression ( [ eq : rfriction ] ) for @xmath47 is exact , expression ( [ eq : tfriction ] ) for @xmath53 is not , but it ensures that the requirement of eq .",
    "( [ eq : zeronoise ] ) for the noise is satisfied .",
    "this requirement is rooted in the way that the random collision forces are represented in the langevin equation , where the friction describes the mean force impulse , and the noise accounts for the fluctuations around the mean force .",
    "we derived three new equations to characterize the dynamics in media with non - uniform friction .",
