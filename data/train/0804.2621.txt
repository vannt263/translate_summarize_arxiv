    "when the university of luxembourg has been created in the end of 2003 by a join of three existing but independent institutions , the study program of computer science did not exist but was hidden / integrated into an engineering program ( ) as a specialisation only . the study has been industry - oriented but less on science , generally being on an undergraduate level , highly oriented towards software design and programming but less on general fundamentals or research - related issues .",
    "the self - approach of the university of luxembourg has ever been research - oriented , and the aim of creating an university has ever been followed by the claim of establishing a research - oriented university . in this respect , the wish of designing and performing a master program in computer science has been born right after the creation of the university of luxembourg .    nevertheless , fundamental questions have come up , for example , are we able to perform the study program or can we meet the expectations , even though we have to face up to the fact that the university is young and inexperienced and that we not have that much students as other universities still possess ? continuously aware of this , we have identified major guidelines , namely    * to start from our existing strengths , i.e. , to join forces to reach a critical mass . * to offer an interdisciplinary perspective . * to focus on scientifically promising niches .",
    "* to take into account the regional academic context .",
    "* to observe short- and long - term societal and economical needs .    and started the organisation of the program , the share of responsibilities , etc",
    ". the final implementation of have been done it in the spirit of the bologna agreement , accomplished with diverse marketing campaigns like a permanent presence on public events , staying in contact with alumni , and offering social activities to strengthen student life .    today , we are sure to have prepared a master program that fits into the local industrial and academic landscape .",
    "the number of students is constantly around 15 per year , we still are in co - operation and collaboration with other universities , and share an intimacy with researchers from the departments , working in research projects and global research axes . the internal acceptance is still as high as four years ago ; being a personal program of study , is still the gateway to the doctorate .",
    "the masters program is embedded in natural sequence of undergraduate studies ( bachelor ) , graduate studies ( master ) , and doctorate ( figure [ fig : archi0 ] ) .",
    "both the bachelor and the master program can be either academic or professional / industrial .",
    "following the conditions stated in the bologna program ( @xcite ) , the number of ects to may vary from 180 to 240 ects on bachelor level and from 60 to 120 ects in the master level .        for , we have identified four semesters with 120 ects ( sections [ courses ] ) in total .",
    "ects stands for and refers to an european - wide education system that supports transparency , mobility and exchange between european universities . in",
    ", each course has assigned a number of ects , where 1 ects corresponds to 15h global working time of a student per semester .",
    "the global working time compounds the course itself , the pre- and post - processing of a course , and the preparation for the examination . in general",
    ", a course in may start if the number of participating students is at least 3 .",
    "we have designed a study program that is organised into four semesters , each 30 points worth ( figure [ fig : archi2 ] ) .",
    "it consists of an orientation semester with common core courses , followed by the second semester with focused core courses , the specialisation semester ( with specialisation courses ) , and the master thesis ( fourth semester ) .",
    "this architecture has been chosen as the transfer of knowledge regarding an academic education affords time and training .",
    "we believe that this is less guaranteed in two semesters only .      a second aspect has been to direct the research orientation instead of focusing on a too wide orientation . matching this up with existing knowledge strengths and forces ,",
    "this has finally led to the specialisations given in figure [ fig : archi1 ] .",
    "the idea of offering five specialization but mastering them with the existing sources has been solved by synchronising courses in the first and second semester ( section [ courses ] ) .",
    "each course receives a .",
    "a indicates to which specialisation a course belongs to . in this respect and since all courses of the first semester are part of a student s self - orientation , they receive both an for intelligent and adaptive systems , a for bio - informatics , a for communicative systems , an for advanced software system , and a for security and trust . in the second semester , courses are only marked with such specialisation symbols to which they belong to .",
    "all courses are 5 ects worth",
    ". a student must follow this classification in a way that ( s)he select four courses of her / his specialisation plus two courses that are not labelled with the selected specialisation letter .",
    "depending on the student s selection he may stay double - tracked , meeting the conditions for two specialisation simultaneously . in the third semester",
    ", independent courses are offered that uniquely are assigned to one specialisation .",
    "each course is 4 ects worth , a student must visit 4 of them , plus 2 courses from another specialisation .",
    "the courses and are mandatory to all students and are 3 ects worth .",
    "the last semester is fully dedicated to the master thesis , which takes place in the chosen specialisation and which counts 30 ects ( section [ master ] ) .",
    "as the program is research - oriented , the master thesis takes place in the scope of a research project .",
    "alternatively , the master thesis can be done in co - operation with industry .",
    "once , a student has chosen her / his specialisation , ( s)he may switch once to another specialisation . for this , the student must collect all the ects from his new specialisation .",
    "he looses ects , if the ancient visited courses do not fit into the new course system . in figure",
    "[ fig : archi1 ] , the different specialisation are listed ; this list compounds typical computer science fields and bio - informatics , which is performed in co - operation with the dept . of biology .",
    "the master in information and computer sciences program has to be finished by choosing one supervisor and a master thesis of the student s interest .",
    "a master thesis is a major piece of original work that includes research ; it defines a formal written description of that research , and an oral defence of the research as well .",
    "a master thesis should contribute new knowledge to the specified discipline , but will include an extensive review of what others have contributed to the topic as well .",
    "overall , the tone should be scholarly , with a primary audience of other information science researchers .",
    "the master thesis is of a more complex nature than a term paper but less than a doctoral dissertation .",
    "for example , a synthesis and description of others research and writings alone may be appropriate as a term paper .",
    "such a comprehensive must be included as a subsection of the thesis but is not sufficient by itself .",
    "on the other hand , a doctoral dissertation might use an experimental or survey methodology involving large numbers of subjects on a national or international level .",
    "a master thesis may be narrower in scope , being restricted to a local problem or a smaller number of subjects .",
    "a master thesis should not just be an expression of an opinion ; conclusions and opinions must be based on research results and analysis .",
    "assume , the following courses @xmath0 are offered where @xmath1 corresponds to the semester number and @xmath2 to the list of specialization , indicated by the corresponding letter mark :    * first semester courses @xmath3 = ( @xmath4 , @xmath4 , @xmath4 , @xmath4 , @xmath4 ) , 30 ects worth . * second semester courses @xmath5 @xmath5 = ( @xmath6 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath11 , @xmath9 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath13 , @xmath13 ) ( each 5 ects worth ) . *",

    "then a student chooses all courses in the first semester , all courses labelled with an if ( s)he chooses specialisation a plus two other courses , for example @xmath6 and @xmath6 , in the second semester . as the student visits the requested four courses both for specialization and , ( s)he may select between these specialization right after the second semester . in the third semester , the student visits the four courses from the chosen specialisation ( either or ) and two other courses in @xmath15 plus the two courses from @xmath21 .",

    "the program aims to provide a modern curriculum in the spirit of the bologna agreement ( @xcite ) , focusing on five core areas . in the opinion of the review team , the profile and the goals of the program are appropriate to a modern high - level program in the information and computer sciences .",
    "the program connects closely with the research areas ( sections [ labs ] , [ p1 ] ) offered within the faculties respectively the departments that are responsible for the program .",
    "this should provide an excellent environment for the education and training offered in the program .",
