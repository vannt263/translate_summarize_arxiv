    "thanks to rapid advances in data retrieval technology coupled with the advent of the internet and personal electronic devices , we are witnessing the emergence of unprecedented opportunities to collect , analyze , and understand massive data encoding a variety of human behaviors , prompting calls for collaborative efforts from various disciplines in the scientific community  @xcite . one topic gaining heightened interest in the physics community in particular",
    "is how one can understanding the spatiotemporal movements of humans  @xcite , an example being a recent numerical study by gonzlez  _ et  al . _  of human mobility data gathered from mobile phone communication records  @xcite .",
    "one intriguing finding in their work was that the distance or area covered by human trajectory appears to be bounded or increase extremely slowly in time @xmath0 , which highlights the stark difference between classical models of particle motion such as random walk and lvy flight  @xcite where the expected fluctuation in the displacement of a particle grow unbounded as polynomials of time @xmath0 ( a notable exception is the random walk in random enviroment ( rwre ) where a weak spatial randomness assigned to lattice points lead to a @xmath1 behavior in the average fluctuation  @xcite ) .",
    "given the success of these models in explaining real physical systems such as diffusive gases in free space , it is natural to examine their validity in understanding human mobility data .",
    "but as gonzlez  _ et  al .",
    "_   showed , the simplistic nature of these models are not suited for that task , which showcases the inherent complexity of human motion . for the same reason , devising a simple generative model of human motion appears extremely difficult if at all possible , requiring more theoretical approaches to understanding the observed behavior of human motion on a deeper level .",
    "as a first step in that direction , in this paper we study analytically a number of observations given in gonzlez  _ et  al .",
    "_  specifically , we employ the framework of markov processes , the fundamental and indispensable methodology in the study of stochastic processes in a variety of scientific and engineering fields such as including linguistics , computational biology , graph theory , and information theory , to name a few@xcite : we construct the markov transition matrix from mobile communication data , and investigate its properties via eigenmode analysis .",
    "we show that this allows us to understand the aforementioned slow increase of fluctuations in human motion in time and , furthermore , and promises to be a methodology to characterize patterns of individuals motions according via the eigenmodes of the transition matrices .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sectiona ] , we introduce the markov transition matrix constructed from the observed transition rates between spatial coordinates . in sec .",
    "[ sectionb ] , we investigate the various properties of eigenmodes , from which we present a theoretical understanding of the radius of gyration . in sec .",
    "[ sectionc ] , we show that the eigenmodes act as a concise descriptor of the characteristics of individual movement patterns . finally , we summarize and discuss our findings and their implications in sec .",
    "[ sectiond ] .",
    "for this study , we employed a mobile phone - usage data set provided from a western european service provider , used in a previous study of gonzlez  _ et  al . _",
    "[ data_scheme ]  ( a ) illustrates the basic format of the data ; for each individual we have a table listing the time and the location of each of @xmath2 calls initiated by the user ( varying from individual to individual ) during an observational period of six months .",
    "the spatial location of the user at the call initiation is given by the i d of the transmission tower nearest to the user , meaning that the resolution of the user location is dictated by the size of non - overlapping _ voronoi cells _ centered around each tower , presented schematically in fig .",
    "[ data_scheme ]  ( b ) .",
    "since one voronoi cell corresponds to one transmission tower , we may use the two concepts interchangeably . the number @xmath3 of unique tower ids appearing in fig .",
    "[ data_scheme ]  ( a ) satisfies @xmath4 , the number of calls . from this table",
    ", we build for each individual a @xmath5 * markov matrix * ( also called the transition matrix ) @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the probability that the user has been observed ( made a call ) at voronoi cell @xmath8 right after being observed at cell @xmath9 with no other observation in between : if the individual was observed at @xmath9 for a total of @xmath10 times and subsequently at tower @xmath8 with no observations in between for a total of @xmath11 times ( @xmath12 ) during the observation period , @xmath13   becoming a `` sink '' which happens when there is no record of transition away from it , we assume that the individual makes an additional transition from it to the first voronoi cell visited at @xmath14 .    the matrix @xmath15 constructed in this manner exhibits the following mathematical properties .",
    "first , each column of @xmath15 sums to unity since @xmath16 .",
    "the same can not be said for the rows , however , since @xmath15 is asymmetric in general .",
    "second , from the perron - frobenius theorem , @xmath15 always has a leading eigenvalue @xmath17 , whose associated right eigenvector is @xmath18 , where @xmath19 represents the stationary probability of observing the user at each tower location ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "this can be easily understood : the stationarity condition is @xmath21 , which we can also write as @xmath22 with @xmath23 .",
    "lastly , all eigenvalues satisfy @xmath24 , i.e. they are confined within the unit circle on the complex plane .",
    "our presentation of human motion as a stochastic markov process involves some simplification .",
    "firstly , we assume that the calls were placed evenly spaced throughout the six - month observation period .",
    "therefore , we do not address the impact of the the inter - call time distribution  @xcite or the possible explicit time dependence of the element @xmath7 of @xmath15 .",
    "secondly , our @xmath15 incorporates the history dependence of one step only : a transition depends only on the current location , but not further into the past . without these simplifications , one could possibly carry out a much more detailed and precise analysis .",
    "we may , for instance , construct a time - dependent matrix @xmath25 reflects the changes in call patterns during the course of the day .",
    "we may also construct @xmath15 to be of a higher dimension ( e.g. , @xmath26 ) so that it incorporates history further into the past than one step as we do here .",
    "but doing so would render the analysis presented in this paper unnecessarily complex .",
    "nevertheless , our current construction of @xmath15 still yields interesting and useful insights to understanding human mobility , which we hope lays a foundation for future research that incorporate those possibilities .",
    "a quantity of central focus in gonzlez  _ et  al . _",
    "is the _ radius of gyration _ , defined in a squared form as  @xcite @xmath27 a dynamic variable ( as a function of @xmath28 , the index of the calls in fig .",
    "[ data_scheme ]  ( a ) ) that measures the size of the trajectory at each transition , which demonstrated the stark contrast between actual human motion and classical random walk models .",
    "we here ask whether our stochastic process approximation is able to reproduce its slow , sub - polynomial growth shown in ref .  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ rgaverage ] we compare , the @xmath29-axis rescaled from @xmath28 to real time @xmath0 , the empirical temporal growth of @xmath30 and that from simulations based on @xmath15 , averaged over all individuals with @xmath31 .",
    "we see that the actual curve and the simulation curve match within @xmath32 , validating our approximation . to highlight the importance of incorporating history we also plotted the corresponding curve generated from the * bernoulli matrix * @xmath33 .",
    "a bernoulli matrix is also a transition matrix with no history dependence : its entry @xmath34 is simply equal to @xmath20 , simply the stationary probability to be at @xmath8 with no regard to one s present location .",
    "@xmath33 shows a markedly quicker convergence of @xmath35 to @xmath36 , significantly deviating from actual data .",
    "this handily demonstrates that temporal correlation between individual s locations is an essential factor in modelling human mobility . in the following ,",
    "we study the relationship between @xmath37 , eq .",
    "( [ defrg ] ) and the transition matrix to better understand the origin of this behavior .      under the markov process @xmath15 , the expected value of the square of the radius of gyration , eq .",
    "( [ defrg ] )   rather than @xmath35 which is much more complicated to treat analytically . ] , at the @xmath28-th step can be written as @xmath38 where @xmath39 denotes the location of the user at the @xmath40th step ( @xmath41 ) , @xmath42 is a diagonal @xmath5 matrix of @xmath43 , and @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the coordinates of the @xmath3 unique voronoi cells that a user has visited .",
    "thanks to the stationary condition that @xmath46 represents the probability of finding the individual at cell @xmath8 at any step , the vector product @xmath47 depends only the step difference @xmath48 , leading to @xmath49 .    the transition matrix can be expressed as @xmath50 , where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are its left- and right - eigenvector matrices normalized so that @xmath53 , and @xmath54 is the diagonal matrix of @xmath15 s eigenvalues @xmath55 .",
    "therefore we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ rgdef ] ) as @xmath56 \\nonumber \\\\ & = \\sum_{k=1}^k\\rho_k\\biggl[1-\\biggl(\\frac{1+{\\lambda}_k}{1-{\\lambda}_k}\\biggr)\\frac{1}{s}+\\biggl(\\frac{2{\\lambda}_k(1-{\\lambda}_k^s)}{(1-{\\lambda}_k)^2}\\biggr)\\frac{1}{s^2}\\biggr]\\nonumber \\\\ & \\equiv \\sum_k\\rho_k{\\mathcal{f}}({\\lambda}_k , s ) , \\label{decomposition}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have defined the _ mode weight _ @xmath57 , invariant in @xmath28 , with @xmath58    thus we have decomposed the expected value of @xmath59 into a sum of independent contributions from the @xmath3 eigenmodes of @xmath15 . specifically , eq .  ( [ decomposition ] ) says that each eigenmode contributes in two ways : via the @xmath28-independent weight @xmath60 and the @xmath28-dependent @xmath61 .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fbehavior ] the behavior of @xmath62 we show only the real portion of @xmath63 : in truth , @xmath64\\ne0 $ ] when @xmath65\\ne0 $ ] , i.e. complex . in that case , its conjugate @xmath66 is also an eigenvalue of @xmath15 with mode weight @xmath67 .",
    "the combined effect of the two are basically @xmath68 $ ] . ] : ( a ) when @xmath69 is real ( i.e. @xmath70 ) , the closer @xmath69 is to @xmath71 , the faster the convergence of @xmath62 to its maximum value @xmath72 .",
    "( interestingly , @xmath73 does not contribute at all , since @xmath74 .",
    "also , the bernoulli matrix @xmath33 has @xmath75 as its only eigenvalue except the leading @xmath73 .",
    "compare the yellow curve in fig .",
    "[ rgaverage ] and the curve for @xmath75 . )",
    "( b ) when @xmath69 is complex ( i.e. @xmath76 ) , convergence to the maximum is also accelerated as @xmath77 approaches @xmath78 for a given value of @xmath79 ( @xmath80 in fig .",
    "[ fbehavior ]  ( b ) ) .      comparing figs .",
    "[ rgaverage ]  and  [ fbehavior ] , we find that typical temporal behavior of @xmath35 is most likely due to modes with eigenvalues that are real and positive , close to @xmath72 .",
    "thus there are two possible scenarios : the first is that most eigenvalues of @xmath15 happen to be @xmath82 , resulting in a slow increase of @xmath35 _ regardless _ of any other factors in eq .",
    "( [ decomposition ] ) such as @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "the other is that , while the eigenvalues are broadly distributed over the complex unit circle , only those that are close to @xmath72 carry large mode weights @xmath81 .    to find the more likely scenario , for each individual we investigated the following two sets @xmath85 and @xmath86 of eigenvalues :    * set @xmath85 comprises eigenvalues with @xmath87 and @xmath88 , contained within the blue and the yellow areas inside the unit circle in fig .",
    "[ rkhistogram ]  ( a ) .",
    "* set @xmath86 comprises eigenvalues with @xmath89 and @xmath90 , contained within the yellow area in fig .",
    "[ rkhistogram ]  ( a ) .",
    "if the second scenario is correct , we should see only a small number of eigenmodes contained within @xmath85 and @xmath86 , while their combined mode weights @xmath91 account for most of @xmath92 .",
    "this is precisely what we see in fig .",
    "[ rkhistogram ]  ( b ) and ( c ) : in fig .  [ rkhistogram ]  ( b ) , we see that for 85% and 99% of the individuals , respectively , @xmath85 and @xmath86 contain fewer than @xmath93 of their eigenvalues .",
    "on the other hand , fig .",
    "[ rkhistogram ]  ( c ) shows that , for @xmath94 and @xmath95 of the individuals , respectively , eigenmodes in @xmath85 and @xmath86 account for @xmath96 of @xmath97 ( note @xmath81 need not be positive for every eigenmode ",
    "@xmath81 only has to sum up to @xmath97 , so the sum of @xmath81 of a subset of eigenmodes may exceed @xmath97 ) .",
    "thus we can conclude that only a minority of eigenvalues near @xmath72 account for most of @xmath97 , causing the slowly increasing behavior we see in fig .",
    "[ rgaverage ] .",
    "next , we further explore the implications of such behavior at the individual level by understanding the meaning of the eigenmodes of @xmath15 in detail .",
    "let @xmath98 denote the probability to find an individual at a voronoi cell @xmath99 at step @xmath28 under the markov process .",
    "then we can express @xmath100 as @xmath101 where @xmath102 are the right eigenvectors of @xmath15 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath103 can be obtained from @xmath104 .",
    "this means that @xmath105 is a sum of independent temporal evolutions of the eigenmodes themselves .",
    "again , note that @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 can be complex due to the asymmetric nature of @xmath15 . a complex - valued eigenmode would contribute to @xmath105 , in conjunction with its complex conjugate ( which is also an eigenmode of @xmath15 ) , as @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the @xmath111-th component of @xmath108 , and @xmath112 , @xmath113 , and @xmath114 , guaranteeing that @xmath105 , a probability , is always real .    in the asymptotic",
    "@xmath115 limit all modes decay to zero except the leading mode with @xmath17 , so that @xmath116 , the stationary occupation probability . for finite @xmath28 ,",
    "however , the transient dynamics , governed by non - leading eigenvalues , can be important and offer interesting detail of the physical process . in this section , therefore , we study the non - leading eigenmodes , and discuss how they can characterize individual human mobility patterns . for convenience ,",
    "we discuss real- and complex - valued eigenmodes separately .      note that eq .",
    "( [ pevolve ] ) holds for a real - valued eigenmode as well : the angular variables @xmath117 are merely restricted to either @xmath118 or @xmath78 .",
    "first , consider @xmath119 . within the same eigenmode @xmath99 , it is possible that some @xmath119 are @xmath118 while others are @xmath78 ( equivalently , the components can be positive or negative ) .",
    "since each component corresponds to a voronoi cell , this means that we can cluster the voronoi cells into two distinct groups , according to the sign of their eigenvectors ( only in regards to this specific eigenmode ; other eigenmodes can offer different groupings ) . according to eq .",
    "( [ pevolve ] ) , this means that as @xmath28 is incremented , the occupation probabilities of voronoi cells in the same cluster are _ in phase _ , and out of phase with cells in the other cluster . additionally , if @xmath120 ( @xmath121 ) , the occupation probabilities attenuate monotonically , while if @xmath122 ( @xmath123 ) , they fluctuate as they attenuate .",
    "this behavior is visualized in fig .",
    "[ realeig ]  ( a ) , showing the occupation probabilities of the two said clusters ( blue and yellow )  , dependent only on the initial condition , merely dictates the relative magnitude of each eigenmode in eq  ( [ pevolve ] ) at @xmath124 . ]",
    "we can rephrase this in a more intuitive way : when @xmath120 ( @xmath121 ) , the individual is likely to be contained within the same cluster as time progresses , with a small probability of transitioning into the other cluster .",
    "if the individual does cross over to the other cluster , however , the trend persists : their motion is now likely to persist in that group . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath122 @xmath125 , at every step the individual tends to transition to a cell of the other cluster , resulting in a large probability flux exchange between the clusters ( hence the fluctuation ) .",
    "a simple illuminating example is given in fig .",
    "[ realeig ]  ( b ) . in it",
    "we have three voronoi cells represented as nodes @xmath72 , @xmath126 , and @xmath127 . the corresponding transition matrix @xmath15 is @xmath128 which results in the following three eigenmodes : @xmath129    asymptotically ( @xmath115 ) , an individual has an equal probability @xmath130 to be found at each cell .",
    "eigenmodes 1 and 2 dictate the transient behavior : according to eq .",
    "( [ mc1sol ] ) , in eigenmode 1 , cell @xmath72 has a positive eigenvector component @xmath131 while @xmath126 and @xmath127 have negative components . thus if @xmath132 , the walker tends to be confined at cell @xmath72 or in the cluster of cells @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "this is intuitively understandable ; a small @xmath133 means that transition between the two clusters is discouraged , leading to the confinement , and vice versa .",
    "eigenmode 1 does not give us the details on the transition between @xmath126 and @xmath127 , however . this finer detail",
    "is given by eigenmode 2 : in it , cells @xmath126 and @xmath127 are in separate clusters ( cell @xmath72 is completely irrelevant with @xmath134 ) : if @xmath135 , the walker is confined to either @xmath126 or @xmath127 with only a small probability of transitioning to the other , and vice versa .",
    "this is presented graphically in fig .",
    "[ realeig ]  ( b ) .",
    "the discussion so far puts us in a position to explain the behaviors of @xmath62 we see in fig .",
    "[ fbehavior ] . when @xmath136 , the individual has a high propensity to transition to the other cluster than one he is in .",
    "thus the individual covers a larger area in the same time , and thus the radius of gyration increases faster than in the case of @xmath137 .",
    "therefore , concentration of mode weights @xmath81 on modes with @xmath138 is the manifestation of the nature of relatively local movements of humans  were the opposite , we should see large @xmath81 on modes that show a faster increase of the radius of gyration .",
    "we present a real - world example of the voronoi cell clustering in fig .",
    "[ realeig ]  ( c ) .",
    "it shows a small rectangular portion of the country containing ten voronoi cells ( left )  .",
    "a segment of the nation s highway runs along the set .",
    "we consider two largest eigenmodes , 1 and 2 , of an individual who has traversed the cells . @xmath139 and",
    "@xmath140 satisfy @xmath141 .",
    "similar to the simple example of fig .",
    "[ realeig ]  ( b ) , according to eigenmode 1 the entire strand forms a single cluster ( center ) .",
    "this agrees well with our intuition regarding a traveler on a highway  once they enter a highway , it is likely that they stay on it , visiting each cell ( along the strand ) in succession . yet",
    ", this is not yet a conclusive proof of it ; we can not exclude the possibility , however unintuitive it may sound , that the user had driven in a haphazard manner among the cells .",
    "the cell clustering according to eigenmode 2 ( right ) provides an answer : @xmath142 means that there could have been only minimal transitions between the two clusters , showing that the traveler did move in a linear fashion on the highway .",
    "we can readily extend the interpretation of real eigenmodes of the previous section into that of complex - valued eigenmodes ; we need to consider that now the angular variables @xmath117 in eq .",
    "( [ pevolve ] ) can be of any value in @xmath143 .",
    "this means that the voronoi cells can be grouped into more than two clusters , and that the occupation probabilities of each cell may oscillate with varying periods .",
    "we again illustrate this point with a simple example shown in fig .",
    "[ complexeig ]  ( a ) , which exhibits a natural @xmath144 rotational symmetry . solving for its transition matrix , we obtain the following eigenmodes ( without loss of generality , we assume @xmath145 ) : @xmath146    the asymptotic occupation probability is again @xmath130 .",
    "more interestingly , we observe that the eigenvector @xmath147 and its conjugate @xmath148 cluster the cells into three distinct groups , regardless of @xmath133 and @xmath149 .",
    "the transient dynamics of the traveler determined by @xmath150 and @xmath151 , however , does not always reflect the underlying @xmath144 symmetry ( i.e. , a rotational movement of period three ) . to see why ,",
    "let us rewrite @xmath152 and @xmath153 : @xmath154 where we have defined @xmath155 and @xmath156 .",
    "we can say that @xmath157 represents the dynamism of the traveler since it is the probability to transition to a different cell at each step , while @xmath158 represents the rotational tendency of the traveler since a large @xmath158 would result in a stronger clockwise tendency of movement .",
    "first , assume @xmath159 and @xmath160 so that @xmath161 .",
    "this leads to @xmath162 and @xmath163 , and resulting from it is a perpetual ( non - attenuating ) clockwise rotational motion of period three , perfectly reflecting the symmetry of the diagram .",
    "any other combination of @xmath133 and @xmath149 leads to a slower , attenuating motion with larger periods , if at all  from the construction of fig .",
    "[ complexeig ]  ( a ) , a non - zero @xmath149 or @xmath164 would lead to what would function as `` friction '' against a pure rotation of period three .    yet , given that a period - three rotation is the simplest periodic motion arising from complex - valued eigenmodes , it appears worth investigating whether such motion can be readily found in real human trajectories . to check the possibility , we studied the distribution of @xmath165 for eigenvalues with magnitude @xmath166 ( for reasonable persistence ) , shown in fig .",
    "[ complexeig ]  ( b ) .",
    "we find that , although the majority of eigenvalues are real ( @xmath167 or @xmath78 ) , there exist prominent peaks at @xmath168 .",
    "in fact , the peaks represent a sizable portion of the population ( in our dataset , @xmath169 of the individuals )  ( a ) , it means that it is sufficiently isolated to exhibit such eigenvalues . ] .",
    "although our current data set does not include detail on the exact places of visit or activities undertaken by each individual , we present one scenario that appears to be a reasonable origin of the behavior in fig .",
    "[ complexeig ]  ( c ) : it is a schematic of the trajectory of one of the authors ( j.p . ) during typical weekdays , composed mainly of a home - to - work - to - errands - then - back - to - home trajectory with only occasional escapes from it .",
    "it would be extremely interesting , when data much more detailed than the one analyzed here becomes available , to extract such non - trivial yet pronounced ( dominant ) eigenmodes of individuals and see whether they match well to the perceived units of motion ( e.g. , commuting made up of a series of transitions between locales ) .",
    "in this paper , we have presented in detail how the framework of stochastic processes , widely used in theoretical physics , can be used for analysis of large - scale human motion data .",
    "specifically , utilizing the well - established theory of markov matrices , we have demonstrated that the observed temporal evolution of the radius of gyration can be understood via eigenmode analysis of individual transition matrices .",
    "we have also discussed how the eigenvalues and eigenvectors are related to the microscopic characteristic modes of individual mobility .",
    "we anticipate our approach to grow more relevant as innovations continue in large - scale data acquisition technology : even now , with gps - enabled mobile phones becoming more available , individuals are able to track their own movements over locales of interest and couple them with digitalized geographical information ( the so - called `` geo - tagging '' ) to construct a detailed space - time history of one s past whereabouts . on a more social scale , furthermore , we can readily imagine the benefits of a better understanding of human mobility patterns : it would allows us to better design infrastructure such as roads , transportation systems , and vital utilities so that social cost is minimized while location - based human activities are optimally supported  @xcite .",
    "also notable is the active research effort in the field of ecology to understand animal movements  @xcite which have a potential to be helpful in understanding human mobility in urban enviroments as well .",
