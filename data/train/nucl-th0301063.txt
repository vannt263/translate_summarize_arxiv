    "pseudospin was introduced in the late 1960s @xcite to account for the quasidegeneracy of single - nucleon states with quantum numbers ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) and ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 + 3/2 ) where @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath9 are the radial , the orbital , and the total angular momentum quantum numbers , respectively .",
    "these levels have the same `` pseudo - orbital '' angular momentum quantum number , @xmath10 , and `` pseudospin '' quantum number , @xmath11 .    the pseudospin symmetry has been analyzed in nonrelativistic models by several works @xcite .",
    "the subject was revived in recent years when ginocchio @xcite presented a relativistic interpretation for this symmetry showing that the quantum number @xmath12 is the orbital quantum number of the lower component of the dirac spinor for spherical potentials .",
    "moreover , he showed that @xmath12 is a good quantum number in a relativistic theory for the nucleon with scalar @xmath13 and vector @xmath14 potentials with opposite signs and the same magnitude , i.e. , @xmath15 .",
    "actually , this condition can be relaxed to demand that only the derivative of @xmath16 is zero @xcite , but , if @xmath16 goes to zero at infinity , both conditions are equivalent .",
    "these findings are in agreement with the nuclear phenomenology obtained in relativistic mean field ( rmf ) theories , in view of the fact that the scalar and vector potentials in rmf for the nucleus @xcite , although large , cancel each other to a great extent , giving a relatively small negative value for @xmath16 on the nucleon mass scale @xcite .",
    "the structure of the radial nodes occurring in pseudospin levels as well as the nuclei wave function for them were also explained in recent works @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , because in the nonrelativistic reduction of the dirac equation @xmath16 acts as the binding potential , it can not be set to zero in nuclei , since in that case there would not be any bound state .",
    "so the question remains how the pseudospin symmetry is realized in nuclei , namely how some levels of pseudospin partners become degenerate or near degenerate .",
    "a partial answer to this question has been given in two previous works @xcite , in which were shown that , using woods - saxon potentials , this degeneracy not only depends on the value of the depth of the @xmath16 potential but also on its characteristic extension ( radius ) and its surface steepness ( diffusivity ) .",
    "furthermore , using an energy decomposition based on a schrdinger - like equation for the radial lower component of the dirac spinor , it was shown that the near - degeneracy of some pseudospin doublets arises from a cancellation between the terms in that decomposition , and that the pseudospin - orbit term is in general bigger than the splitting itself .",
    "this agreed with the findings of refs .",
    "@xcite in which the pseudospin - orbit coupling was shown to be a nonperturbative quantity .",
    "the conclusion was that pseudospin symmetry in nuclei has a dynamical character .",
    "the systematics found in refs .",
    "@xcite for the pseudospin dependence on the shape of the nuclear mean fields allowed the explanation for the difference between the energy splittings of proton and neutron pseudospin partners .",
    "this was done by revealing the influence of the @xmath0 potential @xmath17 , which appears in rmf theories , on pseudospin - orbit interaction , favoring pseudospin symmetry for neutron levels as is found experimentally .",
    "however , the role of the coulomb potential @xmath18 for the proton splittings , which has the opposite sign of @xmath17 , was not considered .",
    "a previous study of the isospin dependence of the pseudospin symmetry was done in ref .",
    "@xcite for the zr and sn isotopes , where it was shown that the pseudospin symmetry becomes better for exotic nuclei with a highly diffuse potential .    in this paper",
    "we examine in a more quantitative way this isospin asymmetry , by including explicitly the coulomb and the @xmath17 potentials in the nuclear mean fields for the sn isotopic chain and assess the role of each potential in that asymmetry @xcite .",
    "we will show that even though the pseudospin orbit term is very sensitive to the coulomb potential @xmath19 , the net effect of this potential in the proton pseudospin energy splitting is quite small .",
    "the main contribution to the asymmetry of the neutron and proton pseudospin splitting in nuclei comes from the vector - isovector @xmath20 potential confirming the results found in refs .",

    "in this section , we single out the contribution of the coulomb and vector - isovector @xmath20 potentials to the pseudospin energy splitting for the sn isotopic chain .",
    "these two potentials , as we already referred , are the main source of the isospin asymmetry of the nuclear pseudospin : the quasidegeneracy is better seen for neutrons than for protons .    in order to identify the origin of this asymmetry and also to see if it has a direct relation to the pseudospin orbit potential , we used the energy decomposition given in eq .  ( [ aveg_schroed ] ) .",
    "the proton and neutron potentials obtained for the sn isotopes with woods - saxon fit do not reproduce the small variations in the inner part of the rchb potentials as we can see in fig .  [ fig : neuprofit ] .",
    "therefore , the deeper energy levels are not so well reproduced as the less bound ones .",
    "this should not be a problem insofar as pseudospin symmetry in nuclei is concerned , since it is seen experimentally that this symmetry is in general much better satisfied for the levels near the fermi sea . to perform our analysis we chose the @xmath96 $ ] pseudospin partner , which is close to the fermi sea .",

    "this contribution becomes smaller ( @xmath100 mev ) and essentially the same as the one for the neutron energy splitting .",
    "thus , if we link the pseudospin symmetry only to the pseudospin orbit term and do not take in account the contribution of the other terms , we will be forced to conclude that the coulomb potential is the essential source of the isospin asymmetry seen in the nuclear pseudospin . however , as it has already been pointed out in a previous work @xcite , the pseudospin degeneracy comes from a significant cancellation among all the terms in eq .",
    "( [ aveg_schroed ] ) and not only by the @xmath99 interaction , as can be seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : terms](a ) and [ fig : terms](d ) .",
    "in fact , the contribution for the proton energy difference from kinetic @xmath101 and potential @xmath102 energies increases approximately the same for each of these terms ( @xmath103 mev ) when we exclude the coulomb interaction .",
    "these effects almost cancel the changes produced in the pseudospin orbit term @xmath99 .",
    "thus , the small net effect produced by the exclusion of the @xmath19 in the proton pseudospin energy splitting presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : terms1 ] is essentially due to the changes in the darwin term , which are quite small as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : terms](b ) .",
    "the fact that the coulomb potential does not explain the isospin asymmetry reflects the dynamic nature of the nuclear pseudospin symmetry .",
    "it comes from the contribution of all the terms to the energy splitting and can not be attributed only to the pseudospin - orbit term @xmath99 , which in this case is strongly affected by @xmath104 .",
    "let us now analyze the effect of the vector - isovector potential @xmath20 in this isospin asymmetry .",
    "first , we see from fig .  [",
    "fig : terms](c ) that the contribution of the term @xmath99 to the neutron and proton energy difference remains almost unchanged when we exclude the @xmath20 potential .",
    "the asymmetry between protons and neutrons , as we see in figs .",
    "[ fig : terms](a ) and [ fig : terms](d ) , comes essentially from the effect of @xmath20 in the kinetic and potential terms .",
    "when we exclude this potential in the case of the neutrons , the contribution of @xmath105 and @xmath102 terms are bigger ( the @xmath16 potential is deeper ) , thus increasing the neutron pseudospin energy difference as we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : terms1 ] . in the case of the protons",
    "we see an opposite behavior for these two terms , since the depth of the @xmath16 potential is now smaller ( @xmath20 is attractive for protons ) , decreasing the proton pseudospin energy difference .",
    "thus , as we see in fig .",
    "[ fig : terms1 ] , the neutron and proton pseudospin energy splittings approach each other becoming almost degenerate .",
    "this analysis allow us to conclude that the origin of the proton and neutron asymmetry comes mainly from the vector - isovector @xmath20 potential .",
    "this conclusion is in agreement with previous works that have also investigated this isospin asymmetry @xcite .",
    "our analysis reveals that the effect of @xmath17 in the pseudospin potential in eq .",
    "( [ aveg_schroed ] ) shows up mainly in an indirect way , i.e. , through the change induced in the lower component of the wave function @xmath33 .",
    "this effect has the result that , contrary to what could be expected , the contribution of the expectation value @xmath99 of the potential to the pseudospin energy splitting , either for protons or neutrons , is almost insensitive to the vector - isovector potential .",
    "this fact again manifests the dynamical nature of the nuclear pseudospin symmetry .",
    "the isospin asymmetry analyzed here is then a consequence of the effects of @xmath20 potential in all the terms that contribute to the proton and neutron pseudospin energy splittings .",
    "we have investigated in a quantitative way the effect of the coulomb and the vector - isovector @xmath0 potentials in the proton and neutron asymmetry seen in the nuclear pseudospin . to do this analysis we performed a mean - field model calculation with woods - saxon potentials fitted to the proton and neutron potentials obtained by a sophisticated self - consistent rchb calculation for the sn isotopes @xcite .",
    "we found that the woods - saxon parameters correlate well with the mass number @xmath21 and the proton and neutron number difference @xmath2 , which allowed us to have a general parametrization of the binding potential for the whole isotopic chain . in this general parameterization of the potential",
    "we have separated explicitly the @xmath19 and @xmath20 potentials .",
    "these two potentials are the main source of the isospin asymmetry of the nuclear pseudospin .    in order to identify the origin of this asymmetry we analyzed the effect of those potentials separately in the proton and neutron pseudospin energy splitting along the sn isotopic chain .",
    "this analysis was done taking in account the effect of these potentials in each of the terms that contribute to the pseudospin energy splitting .",
    "this decomposition of the energy helped us to uncover the mechanism behind this isospin asymmetry .",
    "we showed that the isospin asymmetry seen in the pseudospin energy splitting can not be attributed to the pseudospin orbit term .",
    "it comes from a strong cancellation among all the terms that contribute to the energy in agreement with the dynamical nature of these symmetry pointed out before in @xcite .",
    "we explicitly showed that even though the pseudospin orbit term @xmath99 is strongly affected by the coulomb potential @xmath19 , the net effect of this potential on the difference of proton and neutron pseudospin energy is quite small because of the effects of @xmath19 in all the other terms .",
    "the main conclusion of our paper is that the vector - isovector @xmath20 potential gives the main contribution to the observed isospin asymmetry of the nuclear pseudospin , as stated in previous works @xcite .",
    "however , it has little effect on the contribution of the pseudospin orbit interaction term @xmath106 to the pseudospin energy splitting , which means that the changes of the pseudospin potential and of the wave function @xmath107 caused by @xmath17 seem to cancel each other",
    ". therefore , the role of @xmath17 in the pseudospin isospin asymmetry comes from its effects in the other terms contributing to the single - particle energy , especially in the differences between the kinetic and potential energy terms of the pseudospin partners .",
    "this important result shows that the dynamical character of pseudospin symmetry and in particular the nonperturbative nature of the pseudospin potential lie at the heart of the mechanism responsible for the differences of proton and neutron pseudospin energy splittings observed in nature .",

    "<S> we investigate the role of the coulomb and the vector - isovector @xmath0 potentials in the asymmetry of the neutron and proton pseudospin splittings in nuclei . to this end , we solve the dirac equation for the nucleons using central vector and scalar potentials with woods - saxon shape and @xmath1 and @xmath2 dependent coulomb and @xmath0 potentials added to the vector potential . </S>",
    "<S> we study the effect of these potentials on the energy splittings of proton and neutron pseudospin partners along a sn isotopic chain . </S>",
    "<S> we use an energy decomposition proposed in a previous work to assess the effect of a pseudospin - orbit potential on those splittings . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the effect of the coulomb potential is quite small and the @xmath0 potential gives the main contribution to the observed isospin asymmetry of the pseudospin splittings . </S>",
    "<S> this isospin asymmetry results from a cancellation of the various energy terms and can not be attributed only to the pseudospin - orbit term , confirming the dynamical character of this symmetry pointed out in previous works . </S>"
