    "sub - additive ergodic theory plays a major role in modern mathematics .",
    "its development began in probability with the work of hammersley - welsh @xcite and with the seminal paper of kingman @xcite .",
    "substantial discussion with many examples and applications in diverse areas can be found in @xcite and the references therein .    at the heart of",
    "the theory sits kingman s sub - additive ergodic theorem ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  5 ) .",
    "it establishes the existence of an almost sure and @xmath17 limit of @xmath18 for a sub - additive ergodic process @xmath0 . in probabilistic language , this theorem is a type of law of large numbers .",
    "however , it differs significantly from the independent , identically distributed case . in particular , even in the presence of weak dependence , the rate of convergence can be difficult to control .",
    "this rate is the main subject of this paper .",
    "we will see that the corresponding error term can be broken into two pieces , associated respectively to random and deterministic fluctuations of the sequence .",
    "our goal will be to relate these two errors , and the main theorem that we present will establish such a relation valid in a wide range of applications .",
    "we now discuss the background and history of the rate of convergence , beginning with the formal setup .",
    "suppose that @xmath0 is a sequence of random variables indexed by nonnegative integers @xmath19 .",
    "assume the following conditions :    1 .",
    "@xmath20 for all @xmath21 ; 2 .",
    "@xmath22 for each @xmath23 , and this shift operation is ergodic ; 3 .",
    "@xmath24 for some @xmath25 and all @xmath23 .",
    "these assumptions are adequate for kingman s sub - additive ergodic theorem @xcite , which gives @xmath26 where the convergence on the left - hand side is a.s . and in @xmath27 .",
    "although kingman s theorem gives its existence , the value of the limit is process - dependent , and precise characterization is often a challenging question .",
    "the rate of convergence of @xmath18 to @xmath2 has two distinct sources : the deviation of @xmath28 from its mean @xmath29 and the deviation of @xmath29 from @xmath30 .",
    "precisely , if we write @xmath31 then @xmath32 one can typically control the random fluctuation term by using techniques from concentration of measure @xcite .",
    "for example , in many probabilistic models that we will discuss , exponential or gaussian concentration bounds are available .",
    "this is particularly true when there is an underlying product space and the @xmath33 s do not depend too heavily on any of the coordinates @xcite .",
    "a priori , there is no clear relation between two parts of .",
    "indeed , in many examples we can modify the long term behavior of the non - random fluctuation term by adding a deterministic sub - additive process and therefore not changing the random part . however , the only current methods to bound the non - random fluctuation term use estimates for the random fluctuation part and rely on intrinsic properties of the process .",
    "to put our theorems in context , we briefly review past results .",
    "upper bounds for the non - random fluctuations have been established in many examples including first - passage percolation @xcite , last - passage percolation @xcite and longest common subsequence @xcite . in 1997 ,",
    "a general theory was given by k. alexander to bound the non - random fluctuation term by the random fluctuation term @xcite .",
    "his ingenious convex hull approximation property applies to several processes that are naturally indexed by the @xmath34-dimensional integer lattice .",
    "lower bounds for non - random fluctuations are significantly less developed . to our knowledge ,",
    "the only results in this direction are given by kesten @xcite in the example of first - passage percolation and @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  8.2 ) for classes of `` euclidean functionals '' of point processes .",
    "in particular , there is no general framework that deals with lower bounds .",
    "our objective is to provide such a framework .",
    "below we list the main points of the article .",
    "our overall assumption is that the process @xmath0 has a weak - dependence structure . in points 1 and 2",
    "we assume the existence of a random fluctuation exponent .    1 .   non - diffusive fluctuations give rise to non trivial non - random fluctuations .",
    "in our main theorem , theorem [ thm : main1 ] , we show that if @xmath35 then @xmath36 is at least of order of @xmath37 for some constant @xmath38 .",
    "a similar result holds if the variance grows as a super - linear power of @xmath23 .",
    "2 .   in ideal non - diffusive conditions both fluctuation terms",
    "have the same order . in the same theorem ,",
    "theorem [ thm : main1 ] , we show that if @xmath39 behaves as @xmath40 for @xmath8 then @xmath36 grows at least as @xmath41 . comparing to the work of alexander mentioned above ,",
    "one therefore obtains that in many applications of interest both terms are comparable .",
    "this result is particularly suited to models of kpz type @xcite , where @xmath5 is expected to be @xmath42 .",
    "3 .   application to @xmath34-dimensional first - passage percolation .",
    "we establish a lower bound of the form @xmath43 for infinitely many @xmath23 and any @xmath44 without assuming the existence of any fluctuation exponent . the best bound before this work is due to kesten @xcite who showed a lower bound of order @xmath45 for all @xmath23 .",
    "this bound becomes more relevant in high dimensions , where many believe the random fluctuation exponent approaches zero .",
    "the assumption of weak - dependence is easily checked in many models of interest .",
    "we provide examples in section [ sec : examples ] .",
    "the proofs of these results come from a new iterative scheme that we develop in section  [ sec : proof ] to bound the ratios @xmath46 for @xmath23 and @xmath47 large .",
    "we will sketch this procedure in section [ sec : sketch ] .",
    "the main results on convergence that follow require some asymptotic independence for the collection @xmath0 .",
    "one possibility is to assume a strong mixing rate for this collection . in practice , though , these random variables often obey a positive association which allows us to assume merely suitable decay of correlations .",
    "so we add the following to our list of assumptions .",
    "* the collection @xmath0 obeys either * condition i * ( mixing ) or * condition ii * ( association with small covariances ) detailed below .",
    "this assumption is valid , for instance , if for each @xmath48 , the variables @xmath49 are independent with a non - degenerate distribution and two moments .",
    "( association condition ii holds in this case . )",
    "let us now detail these conditions .    for each @xmath50 define the function @xmath51 by @xmath52 where the second supremum is over all events @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",

    "item 3 above is a strong example of a sufficient mixing condition and can be considerably relaxed .",
    "item 1 is a covariance assertion , and can be proved from 3 in the presence of finite @xmath65 moments if the mixing rate @xmath66 is assumed to increase suitably with @xmath23",
    ".    * condition ii * : ( association condition . ) the variables @xmath0 are positively associated : for any real - valued coordinatewise nondecreasing functions @xmath67 on realizations of @xmath0 @xmath68 in addition , we need to assume an asymptotic negligibility of the covariances .",
    "the condition comes from @xcite : there is a function @xmath69 such that @xmath70 as @xmath71 and @xmath72 the covariance assumption can often be verified if one has bounds on the mixing rate @xmath66 . in this case",
    "one can use lemma  [ lem : orthogcontrol ] to decouple @xmath73 from @xmath74 .",
    "* definition of exponents *    we will define two exponents : one measures the random fluctuations of @xmath0 and the other measures the convergence rate of @xmath1 to @xmath2 .",
