    "the output signals of complex systems exhibit fluctuations over multiple scales@xcite which are characterized by absence of dynamic scale , i.e. , scale - invariant behavior@xcite .",
    "these signals , due to the nonlinear mechanisms controlling the underlying interactions , are also typically non - stationary and their reliable analysis can not be achieved by traditional methods , e.g. , power - spectrum and auto - correlation analysis@xcite . on the other hand , the detrended fluctuation analysis ( dfa)@xcite has been established as a robust method suitable for detecting long - range power - law correlations embedded in non - stationary signals .",
    "this is so , because a power spectrum calculation assumes that the signal is stationary and hence when applied to non - stationary time series it can lead to misleading results .",
    "thus , a power spectrum analysis should be necessarily preceded by a test for the stationarity of the ( portions of the ) data analyzed . as for the dfa",
    ", it can determine the ( mono ) fractal scaling properties ( see below ) even in non - stationary time series , and can avoid , in principle , spurious detection of correlations that are artifacts of non - stationarities .",
    "dfa has been applied with successful results to diverse fields where scale - invariant behavior emerges , such as dna@xcite , heart dynamics@xcite , circadian rhythms@xcite , meteorology@xcite and climate temperature fluctuations@xcite , economics@xcite as well as in the low - frequency ( @xmath2 hz ) variations of the electric field of the earth that precede earthquakes@xcite termed seismic electric signals@xcite and in the relevant@xcite magnetic field variations@xcite .",
    "monofractal signals are homogeneous in the sense that they have the same scaling properties , characterized locally by a single singularity exponent @xmath3 , throughout the signal .",
    "thus , monofractal signals can be indexed by a single global exponent , e.g. , the hurst exponent @xmath4 , which suggests that they are stationary from viewpoint of their local scaling properties ( see ref.@xcite and references therein ) . since dfa can measure only one exponent , this method is more suitable for the investigation of monofractal signals .",
    "in several cases , however , the records can not be accounted for by a single scaling exponent ( i.e. , do not exhibit a simple monofractal behavior ) . in some examples",
    ", there exist crossover ( time- ) scales separating regimes with different scaling exponents .",
    "in general , if a multitude of scaling exponents is required for a full description of the scaling behavior , a multifractal analysis must be applied .",
    "multifractal signals are intrinsically more complex , and inhomogeneous , than monofractals ( see ref.@xcite and references therein )",
    ". a reliable multifractal analysis can be performed by the multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis , mf - dfa@xcite or by the wavelet transform ( e.g. , see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "dfa has been applied , as mentioned , to the ses activities .",
    "it was found@xcite that when dfa is applied to the original time series of the ses activities and artificial ( man - made ) noises , both types of signals lead to a slope at short times ( i.e. , @xmath5 ) lying in the range @xmath6=1.1 - 1.4 , while for longer times the range @xmath6=0.8 - 1.0 was determined without , however , any safe classification between ses activities and artificial noises . on the other hand ,",
    "when employing natural time ( see section ii ) , dfa enables the distinction between ses activities and artificial noises in view of the following difference : for the ses activities the @xmath6-values lie approximately in the range 0.9 - 1.0 ( or between 0.85 to 1.1 , if a reasonable experimental error is envisaged ) , while for the artificial noises the @xmath6-values are markedly smaller , i.e. , @xmath6=0.65 - 0.8 .",
    "in addition , mf - dfa has been used@xcite and it was found that this multifractal analysis , when carried out in the conventional time frame , did not lead to any distinction between these two types of signals , but does so , if the analysis is made in the natural time domain .             versus the scale @xmath7 in natural time : we increase the percentage of data loss p by removing segments of length @xmath8 samples from the signal of fig.[fig1](a ) .",
    "the black ( plus ) symbols correspond to no data loss ( p=0 ) , the red ( crosses ) to 30% data loss ( p=0.3 ) , the green ( asterisks ) to 50% data loss ( p=0.5 ) and the blue ( squares ) to 70% data loss ( p=0.7 ) . except for the case",
    "p=0 , the data have been shifted vertically for the sake of clarity .",
    "the slopes of the corresponding straight lines that fit the data lead to @xmath90.95 , 0.94 , 0.88 and 0.84 from the top to bottom , respectively .",
    "they correspond to the average values of @xmath10 obtained from 5000 surrogate time - series that were generated with the method of surrogate by ma et al.@xcite ( see the text ) . ]",
    "( a ) , @xmath11(b ) and @xmath12(c ) to recognize the signal of fig.[fig1](a ) as true ses activity when considering various percentages of data loss p=0.2 , 0.3 , 0.5 , 0.7 and 0.8 as a function of the length @xmath13 of the contiguous samples removed .",
    "the removal of large segments leads to better results when using dfa in natural time ( a ) , whereas the opposite holds when using the conditions of eqs.([eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) for @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( b ) .",
    "the optimum selection ( c ) for the identification of a signal as ses activity consists of a proper combination of the aforementioned procedures in ( a ) and ( b ) , see the text .",
    "the values presented have been obtained from 5000 surrogate time - series ( for a given value of @xmath17 and @xmath13 ) , and hence they a have plausible error 1.4% ( @xmath18 ) . ]",
    "the aforementioned findings of dfa for ses activities , are consistent with their generation mechanism@xcite which could be summarized as follows . beyond the usual intrinsic lattice defects@xcite that exist in solids , in ionic solids in particular ,",
    "when doped with aliovalent impurities , extrinsic defects are formed for the sake of charge compensation .",
    "a portion of these defects are attracted by the nearby impurities , thus forming electric dipoles the orientation of which can change by means of a defect migration . in the focal area of an impending earthquake",
    "the stress gradually increases and hence affects the thermodynamic parameters of this migration , thus it may result in a gradual decrease of their relaxation time .",
    "when the stress ( pressure ) reaches a _",
    "critical _ value , a _ cooperative _ orientation of these dipoles occurs , which leads to the emission of a transient signal .",
    "this signal constitutes the ses activity and , since it is characterized by _",
    "critical _ dynamics , should exhibit infinitely range temporal correlations .",
    "this is consistent with the above findings of dfa that for ses activities @xmath0 .",
    "hereafter , we will solely use dfa in view of its simplicity and its ability to reliably classify ses activities .",
    "it is the basic aim of this study to investigate how significant data loss affects the scaling behavior of long - range correlated ses activities inspired from the new segmentation approach introduced recently by ma et al@xcite to generate surrogate signals by randomly removing data segments from stationary signals with different types of long - range correlations .",
    "the practical importance of this study becomes very clear upon considering that such a data loss is inevitable mainly due to the following two reasons : first , failure of the measuring system in the field station , including the electric measuring dipoles , electronics and the data collection system , may occur especially due to lightning .",
    "second , noise - contaminated data segments are often unavoidable due to natural changes such as rainfall , lightning , induction of geomagnetic field variations and ocean - earth tides besides the noise from artificial ( man - made ) sources including the leakage currents from dc driven trains .",
    "the latter are common in japan where at some sites they may last for almost 70@xmath19 of the time every day .",
    "we clarify , however , that even at such noisy - stations in japan , several clear ses activities have been unambiguously identified@xcite during the night ( when the noise level is low ) .",
    "in addition , prominent ses activities were recently reported@xcite at noise - free stations ( far from industrialized regions ) having long duration , i.e. , of the order of several weeks",
    ". as we shall see , our results described in section iv , are in essential agreement with those obtained in the innovative and exhaustive study of ma et al@xcite . before proceeding to our results",
    ", we will briefly summarize dfa and natural time analysis in section ii , and then present in section iii the most recent ses data along with their analysis in natural time . in section",
    "v , we summarize our conclusions .",
    "we first sum up the original time series and determine the profile @xmath20 ; we then divide this profile of length @xmath21 into @xmath22(@xmath23 ) non overlapping fragments of @xmath7-observations .",
    "next , we define the detrended process @xmath24 , in the @xmath25-th fragment , as the difference between the original value of the profile and the local ( linear ) trend .",
    "we then calculate the mean variance of the detrended process : @xmath26 where @xmath27 if @xmath28 , the slope of the log@xmath29 versus log@xmath7 plot , leads to the value of the exponent @xmath30 .",
    "( this scaling exponent is a self - similarity parameter that represents the long - range power - law correlations of the signal ) .",
    "if @xmath10=0.5 , there is no correlation and the signal is uncorrelated ( white noise ) ; if @xmath310.5 , the signal is anti - correlated ; if @xmath320.5 , the signal is correlated and specifically the case @xmath10=1.5 corresponds to the brownian motion ( integrated white noise ) .",
    "we now summarize the background of natural time @xmath33 . in a time series comprising @xmath21 events",
    ", the natural time @xmath34 serves as an index@xcite for the occurrence of the @xmath35-th event .",
    "the evolution of the pair ( @xmath36 ) is studied@xcite , where @xmath37 denotes a quantity proportional to the _ energy _ released in the @xmath35-th event . for dichotomous signals , which is frequently the case of ses activities , the quantity @xmath37 stands for the duration of the @xmath35-th pulse . by defining @xmath38 , we have found@xcite that the variance @xmath39 where @xmath40 , of the natural time @xmath33 with respect to the distribution @xmath41 may be used@xcite for the identification of ses activities . in particular",
    ", the following relation should hold @xmath42    the entropy @xmath15 in the natural time - domain is defined as@xcite @xmath43 it exhibits@xcite lesche@xcite ( experimental ) stability , and for ses activities ( critical dynamics ) is smaller@xcite than the value @xmath44 ) of a `` uniform '' ( u ) distribution ( as defined in refs .",

    "this has been recorded at lamia station located in central greece during the period 27 december - 30 december , 2009 .",
    "almost three weeks later , two strong earthquakes of magnitude @xmath53(ath)=5.7 and 5.6 occurred in central greece with an epicenter at 38.4@xmath54n 22.0@xmath54e ( but see also refs.@xcite ) .    the two signals in figs .",

    "( we also note that the classification of this signal as ses activity had been previously achieved by independent procedures discussed@xcite in the royal society meeting that was held during may 11 - 12 , 1995 before@xcite the occurrence of the 6.6 earthquake on may 13 , 1995 . ) for the long duration signal of fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) , the procedure explained in detail in ref.@xcite was followed .",

    "the percentage @xmath17 of the data loss , i.e. , the percentage of the data removed , also characterizes the signal @xmath56 .",
    "the procedure followed is based on the construction of a binary time - series @xmath58 of the same length as @xmath57 .",

( ii ) we then construct an auxiliary time - series @xmath63 with @xmath64 when @xmath65 and @xmath66 when @xmath67 of size @xmath68 .",
    "( iii)we shuffle the time - series @xmath63 randomly to obtain @xmath69 .",
    "( iv)we then append @xmath69 to obtain @xmath58 : if @xmath70 we keep it , but we replace all @xmath71 with @xmath13 elements of value 0 and one element with value 1. in this way , a binary series @xmath58 is obtained , which has a size equal to the one of the original signal @xmath57 .",
    "we then construct the surrogate signal @xmath56 by simultaneously scanning the original signal @xmath57 and the binary series @xmath58 , removing the @xmath72-th element of @xmath57 if @xmath73 and concatenating the segments of the remaining data to @xmath56 .",
    "the resulting signal @xmath56 is later analyzed in natural time , thus leading to the quantities @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 as well as to the dfa exponent @xmath10 in natural time .",
    "such an example is given in fig .",
    "[ figx ] . in what remains we present the results focusing hereafter , as mentioned , on the example of the ses activity depicted in fig .",

    "[ fig2 ] . for the sake of comparison",
    ", this figure also includes the case of no data loss ( i.e. , @xmath76 ) .",
    "we notice a gradual decrease of @xmath10 upon increasing the data loss , which affects our ability to classify a signal as ses activity .    in order to quantify ,",
    "in general , our ability to identify ses activities from the natural time analysis of surrogate signals with various levels of data loss , three procedures have been attempted :    let us call procedure 1 , the investigation whether @xmath10 , resulted from the dfa analysis of the natural time representation of a signal , belongs to the range @xmath77 . if it does , the signal is then classified as ses activity .",
    "figure [ fig3](a ) shows that for a given amount of data loss ( @xmath17=const ) , upon increasing the length @xmath13 of the randomly removed segment , the probability @xmath78 of achieving , after making 5000 attempts ( for a given value of @xmath17 and @xmath13 ) , the identification of the signal as ses activity is found to gradually increase versus @xmath13 at small scales and stabilizes at large scales .",
    "for example , when considering the case of @xmath75 data loss ( magenta color in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) ) the probability @xmath78 is close to @xmath79 for @xmath13=50 ; it increases to @xmath80 @xmath81 for @xmath13=100 and finally stabilizes around @xmath82 for lengths @xmath83300 to 500 .",
    "let us now label as procedure 2 , the investigation whether the quantities @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( resulted from the analysis of a signal in natural time ) obey the conditions ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) , i.e. , @xmath84 and @xmath15 , @xmath16 @xmath850.0966 .",
    "if they do so , the signal is classified as ses activity .",
    "figure [ fig3](b ) shows that for a given amount of data loss , the probability @xmath11 of achieving the signal identification as ses activity -that results after making 5000 attempts for each @xmath13 value- gradually decreases when moving from the small to large scales .",
    "note that for the smallest length scale investigated , i.e. , @xmath13=10 ( which is more or less comparable -if we consider the sampling frequency of 1 sample / sec- with the average duration @xmath8611 sec of the transient pulses that constitute the signal ) , the probability @xmath11 reaches values close to @xmath87 even for the extreme data loss of @xmath88 .",
    "this is understood in the context that the quantities @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 remain almost unaffected when randomly removing segments with lengths comparable to the average pulse s duration .",
    "this is consistent with our earlier finding@xcite that the quantities @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are experimentally stable ( lesche s stability ) meaning that they exhibit only slight variations when deleting ( due to experimental errors ) a small number of pulses . on the other hand , at large scales of @xmath13 , @xmath11 markedly decreases .",
    "this may be understood if we consider that , at such scales , each segment of contiguous @xmath13 samples removed , comprises on the average a considerable number of pulses the removal of which may seriously affect the quantities @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 . as an example , for @xmath88 data loss ( cyan curve in fig . [ fig3](b ) ) , and for lengths @xmath13=400 - 500 , the probability @xmath11 of identifying a true ses activity is around @xmath89 .",
    "interestingly , a closer inspection of the two figures [ fig3](a ) and [ fig3](b ) reveals that @xmath78 and @xmath11 play complementary roles . in particular , at small scales of @xmath13 , @xmath78 increases but @xmath11 decreases versus @xmath13 . at large scales , where @xmath78 reaches ( for considerable values of data loss ) its largest value",
    ", the @xmath11 value becomes small .",
    "inspired from this complementary behavior of @xmath78 and @xmath11 , we proceeded to the investigation of a combined procedure , let us call it procedure 3 . in this procedure ,",
    "a signal is identified as ses activity when _ either _ the condition @xmath77 _ or _",
    "the relations ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) are satisfied .",
    "the probability @xmath12 of achieving such an identification , after making 5000 attempts ( for a given value of @xmath17 and @xmath13 ) , is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig3](c ) .",
    "the results are remarkable since , even at significant values of data loss , e.g. , @xmath90 or @xmath91 , the probability @xmath12 of identifying a ses activity at scales @xmath13=100 to 400 remains relatively high , i.e. , @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively ( cf .",
    "note also that the value of @xmath12 reaches values close to @xmath87 at small scales @xmath13=10 ) .",
    "this is important from practical point of view , because it states for example the following : even if the records of a station are contaminated by considerable noise , say @xmath75 of the time of its operation , the remaining @xmath81 of the non - contaminated segments have a chance of @xmath94 to correctly identify a ses activity .",
    "the chances increase considerably , i.e. , to @xmath95 , if only half of the recordings are noisy .",
    "the aforementioned results have been deduced from the analysis of a ses activity lasting around three hours . in cases of ses activities with appreciably longer duration ,",
    "e.g. , a few to several days@xcite detected in greece or a few months in japan@xcite , the results should become appreciably better .",
    "we start our conclusions by recalling that the distinction between ses activities ( critical dynamics , infinitely ranged temporal correlations ) and artificial ( man - made ) noise remains an extremely difficult task , even without any data loss , when solely focusing on the original time series of electrical records which are , of course , in conventional time . on the other hand ,",
    "when combining natural time with dfa analysis , such a distinction becomes possible even after significant data loss .",
    "in particular we showed for example that even when randomly removing @xmath82 of the data , we have a probability ( @xmath12 ) around @xmath96 , or larger , to identify correctly a ses activity .",
    "this probability becomes somewhat smaller , i.e. , 75% , when the data loss increases to 70% . to achieve this goal ,",
    "the proper procedure is the following : the signal is first represented in natural time and then analyzed in order to deduce the quantities @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 as well as the exponent @xmath10 from the slope of the log - log plot of the dfa analysis in natural time .",
    "we then examine whether the latter slope has a value close to unity _ or _ the conditions @xmath97 and @xmath15 , @xmath16 @xmath98 are obeyed . in other words , the consequences caused by an undesirable severe data loss can be markedly reduced upon taking advantage of the dfa and natural time analysis ."
