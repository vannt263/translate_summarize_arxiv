    "the heisenberg model can be mapped to the non - linear sigma model ( @xmath3 ) with an additional term due to berry phases . in 1d",
    "this term has a dramatic effect which was first discovered by haldane @xcite .",
    "integer spin systems have a gap in their excitation spectrum , while half - integer spin systems are gapless but disordered , with an algebraic decay of spin - spin correlations .",
    "in the late 1980s it was found that berry phases do not seem to play a role in 2d for pure heisenberg hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "hence , all heisenberg models on the 2d square lattice are on the ordered side of the @xmath3 model .",
    "this is in agreement with a theorem by dyson , lieb , and simon ( dls)@xcite , extended to 2d systems by neves and peres@xcite , which states that for bipartite lattices with @xmath4 , the ground state is ordered .",
    "furthermore , monte carlo simulations @xcite have convincingly shown that the @xmath5 model has nel order .",
    "affleck @xciteextented to 2d systems a 1d theorem due to lieb , schultz , and mattis @xcite ( lsm ) which applies to half - integer spin systems .",
    "he argued that since this theorem does not apply to integer spin systems , there could be a difference between the disordered phases of half - integer and integer spin systems in 2d as well .",
    "haldane @xcite argued that if by some mechanism it was possible to drive the heisenberg model into the disordered phase , singular topological contributions known as hedgehogs may be relevant . read and sachdev @xcite carried out a systematic study of the 2d heisenberg model in the large-@xmath6 limit .",
    "their results were in agreement with affleck and haldane s predictions .",
    "they predicted that the nature of the disordered phases in 2d is related to the spin value . for odd integer spins ,",
    "the ground state breaks the symmetry of rotation of the lattice by @xmath7 degres , for even integer spins the ground state does not break any lattice symmetry , and for half - integer spins , the lattice symmetry is broken by @xmath8 degres .",
    "the usual criticism against such predictions is that they are obtained in the limit of large spin and they could be invalid for the more relevant cases of small @xmath9 .",
    "it is well possible that a different mechanism can emerge for small @xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath0 model is the most popular model in which a possible disordered phase has been searched . for @xmath5",
    ", it is generally accepted that for @xmath10 , this model has a disordered phase . among the many disordered phases that were proposed @xcite , the columnar dimer phase which was predicted in ref.(@xcite ) seems to gain broader acceptance lately .",
    "but , we have recently argued @xcite that this conclusion , which seems to be supported by numerical experiments using exact diagonalization ( ed ) or series expansions @xcite , may be incorrect .",
    "large scale renormalization group studies on an anisotropic version of the @xmath0 model show that in the region were the disordered phase is expected , physical quantities of the 2d model are nearly identical to those of an isolated chain .",
    "this suggests that there is instead a direct transition at @xmath11 between the nel @xmath2 and @xmath12 phases . at the transition point , the system is disordered with algebraic decay of the correlations along the chains and exponential decay in the other direction .",
    "this state is consistent with the lsm theorem .",
    "while the case @xmath5 has generated numerous studies @xcite , other values of @xmath9 have not been studied to the author s knowledge .",
    "thus , the role of topological effects in the @xmath0 model for small @xmath9 remains unknown . in this letter",
    ", we propose to study the case @xmath1 .",
    "we will apply the two - step density - matrix renormalization group @xcite ( tsdmrg ) to study the spatially anisotropic heisenberg hamiltonian in 2d ,    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the in - chain exchange parameter and is set to 1 ; @xmath15 and @xmath16 are respectively the transverse and diagonal interchain exchanges .",
    "although the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) is anisotropic , it retains the basic physics of @xmath0 model . in the absence of @xmath16 ,",
    "the ground state is a nel ordered state with @xmath2 . when @xmath17 , another nel state with @xmath12 becomes the ground state .",
    "a disordered ground state is expected in the vicinity of @xmath18 . in this study , we will only be concerned with the transition from @xmath2 nel phase to the disordered phase . the lattice size is fixed to @xmath19 ; the transverse coupling is set to @xmath20 and @xmath16 is varied from @xmath21 up to the maximally frustrated point @xmath22 , i.e. , the point where the ground state energy is maximal ( see ref.(@xcite ) ) .",
    "we use periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) in the direction of the chains and open boundary conditions ( obc ) in the transverse direction .",
    "this short paper will be followed by a more extensive work @xcite where a finite size analysis is performed .",
    "we used the tsdmrg @xcite to study the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "the tsdmrg is an extension two 2d anisotropic lattices of the dmrg method of white @xcite . in the first step of the method , ed or the usual dmrg method",
    "are applied to generate a low energy hamiltonian of an isolated chain of lenght @xmath23 keeping @xmath24 states . thus the superblock size is @xmath25 for an @xmath1 system . then @xmath26 low - lying states of these superblock states ,",
    "the corresponding energies , and all the local spin operators are kept .",
    "these describe the renormalized low energy hamiltonian of a single chain .",
    "they form the starting point of the second step in which @xmath15 and @xmath16 are switched on .",
    "the coupled chains are studied again by the dmrg method . like the original dmrg method",
    ", the tsdmrg is variational .",
    "its convergence depends on @xmath24 and @xmath26 , the error is given by @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the truncation errors in the first and second steps respectively .",
    "since the tsdmrg starts with an isolated chain , a possible criticism of the method is that it could not effectively couple the chains .",
    "this means that it would eventually miss an ordered magnetic phase .",
    "the source of this criticism is the observation that the dmrg was introduced to cure the incorrect treatment of the interblock coupling in the old rg . but",
    "this criticism misses the fact that , in the old rg treatment , dividing the lattice into blocks and treating the interblock as a perturbation was doomed to failure because both the intra and inter - block couplings are equal . in the coupled chain problem ,",
    "however , when the interchain coupling is small , it is imperative as wilson @xcite put it long ago to separate the different energy scales .",

    "the finite size gap is @xmath44 which is very close to its value in the thermodynamic limit @xmath45 .",
    "this is because we used pbc and the correlation lenght is about six lattice spacings .",
    "the truncation error during this first step was @xmath46 .",
    "we then kept @xmath47 lowest states of the chain to start the second step . during the second step ,",
    "the ground state with one of the first excited triplet states with @xmath48 were targeted . the truncation error during this second step varies from @xmath49 in the magnetic phase to @xmath50 in the disordered phase .",
    "this behavior of @xmath29 is consistent with previous tests in @xmath5 systems in ref.(@xcite ) where we find that the accuracy of the tsdmrg increases in the highly frustrated regime .",
    "we have shown in ref.(@xcite ) for @xmath5 that : ( i ) the tsdmrg shows a good agreement with qmc for lattices of up to @xmath19 , even if a modest number of states are kept ; ( ii ) spin - spin correlations extrapolate to a finite value in the thermodynamic limit . however , because of the strong quantum fluctuations present for @xmath5 , the extrapolated quantities were small and thus could be doubted .",
    "furthermore , our prediction of a gapless disordered state between the two magnetic phases has been regarded with a certain skepticism @xcite because it would be expected that such a state would be unstable against some relevant perturbation at low energies not reached in our simulation .",
    "this is not the case for @xmath1 , where quantum fluctuations are weaker .",
    "we thus expect larger extrapolated values @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the results in fig.([corlpar ] ) for the correlation function along the chains ,    @xmath53    and in fig.([corltran ] ) for the correlation function in the transverse direction ,    @xmath54    unambiguously show that in the weakly frustrated regime , the system is ordered . despite the strong anisotropy , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are not very different .",
    "the anisotropy is larger for small @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "but , due to the difference in the boundary conditions , @xmath57 seems to reach a plateau while @xmath58 bends downward .",
    "this behavior of @xmath58 is indeed related to the fact that the spins at the edge do not feel the bulk mean - field created by other chains .    as @xmath16 increases , @xmath51 and @xmath52 decreases and vanish at @xmath59 and @xmath60 respectively .",
    "the difference in the value of @xmath61 in the two directions is probably due to the difference in the boundary conditions .    in fig.([orderp ] ) and fig.([ordert ] ) we plot the corresponding order parameters @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the two curves display the typical form of a second order phase transition .",
    "however , we have not extracted any exponent because even though we believe our results will remain true in the thermodynamic limit , finite size effects may nevertheless be important close to the transition . a systematic analysis of this region is left for a future study .    .",
    "]    [ orderp ]    . ]",
    "[ ordert ]    the phase transition is also seen in the spin gap shown in fig.([gap ] ) . in the ordered state ,",
    "the system is gapless .",
    "the finite size spin gap is nearly independent of @xmath16 and is in the order of the truncation error @xmath29 . at the transition which occurs at @xmath60 ,",
    "@xmath64 sharply increases and becomes close to the haldane gap at the maximally frustrated point where we find @xmath65 for @xmath22 .",
    "in this letter , we have studied an anisotropic version of the @xmath0 model with @xmath1 using the tsdmrg .",
    "we find that for a critical value of the frustration , the nel ordered phase is destroyed and the system enters into a disordered phase with a spin gap .",
    "the value of the gap at the maximally frustrated point is close to that of the haldane gap of an isolated chain .",
    "this disordered phase is consistent with the large @xmath6 prediction of ref.(@xcite ) .",
    "this study shows the striking difference between integer and half - interger spin systems . for @xmath5 ,",
    "the tsdmrg predicted a direct transition between the two nel phases with a disordered gapless state at the critical point .",
    "thus , as we have recently found @xcite , despite the fact that the mechanism of the destruction of the nel phase is independent of the value of the spins , at the transition point , topological effects become important leading to the distinction between integer and half - integer spins .",
