    "despite considerable experimental and theoretical efforts over the last few decades , unconventional superconductivity remains one of the most interesting open puzzles in solid - state physics .",
    "while it has been proposed that in some unconventional superconductors several interactions may be responsible for superconductivity , spin fluctuations are argued by a large fraction of the solid - state community to be the dominant mechanism driving cooper pairing in heavy - fermion systems , cuprates , two - dimensional organic charge - transfer salts and the iron - based superconductors  @xcite .",
    "such a statement is based on a few properties that have been found to be characteristic for these material classes like the fact that the superconducting phase is located in close vicinity to an antiferromagnetic ordered state and the phase transition can be easily tuned by application of pressure or charge doping  @xcite .",
    "assuming spin , charge , and orbital fluctuations provide the dominant mechanism driving superconductivity , various theoretical approaches have been developed in the last few decades in order to predict superconducting gap functions , critical temperatures , and functional characteristics of thermodynamic quantities .",
    "here we shall focus on the random phase approximation ( rpa ) for the hubbard model . in the single - orbital case on a three - dimensional cubic lattice this approach leads to a strong enhancement of the singlet coupling in the proximity of a spin - density - wave instability yielding to a @xmath0 symmetry of the gap function  @xcite as observed , for instance , in the high - t@xmath1 cuprates  @xcite .",
    "also for superconducting organic charge - transfer salts  @xcite this approximation seems to correctly predict the symmetry of the superconducting gap@xcite .",
    "recently , such an approximation has been successfully used for the determination of the superconducting gap structure in iron - based superconductors and heavy - fermion systems  @xcite .    while the properties of high - t@xmath1 cuprates or organic charge - transfer salts are well captured by single - orbital models  @xcite , it is crucial to consider multiorbital models@xcite when aiming for a proper description of heavy - fermion systems and iron - based superconductors  @xcite . here",
    "the fermi surfaces consist of several sheets , which emerge from various orbitals at the fermi level that participate in the interactions driving superconductivity .",
    "the matrix - rpa formulation for the single- and multiorbital hubbard model , like other rpa approaches , is built around the idea that terms involving particle - hole susceptibilities associated with a given wave vector @xmath2 and frequency @xmath3 add up coherently , while other terms have a _ random phase _ which suppresses their contribution .",
    "neglection of these _ random phase _",
    "terms in the calculation of the two - particle pairing vertex in the single - orbital case results in a summation of infinite orders of diagrams of pure bubble and ladder topology , yielding an easy - to - evaluate scalar closed - form expression for the pairing interaction . in the multiorbital case , the susceptibilities acquire a complex orbital dependence , and the interaction strength has to be replaced by full interaction matrices operating on the different orbitals .    in this work",
    "we examine the relation between ( i ) the diagrammatic representation of the random phase approximation of the two - particle vertex function in the context of the multiorbital hubbard model considering inter- and intraorbital couplings and ( ii ) the corresponding matrix representation of the fluctuation exchange approximation  @xcite .",
    "the latter has been very commonly used to analyze superconductivity in multiband systems , with the assumption that it was equivalent to the usual bubble and ladder diagrams that occur in the one - band rpa .",
    "in contrast to the derivation based on the separation into the different fluctuation channels  @xcite , we follow the original diagrammatic approach  @xcite and write down all low - order contributions to the two - particle vertex that can be rewritten as products of the interactions and the bare particle - hole susceptibilities . applying this prescription to the single - orbital case",
    ", we recover the well - known result for the interaction vertex where only diagrams of pure bubble or ladder topology are incorporated .",
    "in contrast , in the multiorbital case we find that , in addition to the diagrams that have the same topology as in the single - orbital case , there are additional diagrams that have the structure of vertex corrections .",
    "we analyze the contributions of such diagrams to certain elements of the pairing interaction and discuss their physical importance for the superconducting state .",
    "understanding the relationship between the usual diagrammatic perturbation - resummation approach and the rpa matrix formulation provides insight into the physical processes that are captured in the latter .",
    "we are interested in relating the matrix - rpa form of the pairing vertex illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : rpa](a ) to its diagrammatic representation .    to illustrate our basic point , it is sufficient to consider a two - orbital problem , where the noninteracting part of the hamiltonian @xmath4 is diagonal in spin @xmath5 but allows for hopping between the two orbitals ( @xmath6 or @xmath7 ) .",
    "our discussion can easily be generalized to more than two orbitals .",
    "the noninteracting hamiltonian is given by @xmath8 for the interacting part of our model hamiltonian @xmath9 we first restrict ourselves to the intra- and interorbital coulomb interactions @xmath10 and @xmath11 , as the effects we wish to discuss are included : @xmath12 we will discuss later what happens when hund s rule exchange @xmath13 and pair hopping @xmath14 are included .    for this model , the matrix - rpa pairing interaction in the singlet channel derived in the fluctuation exchange ( flex ) approximation  @xcite in the vicinity of the critical temperature , where the anomalous green s function vanishes , has the following form : @xmath15_{l_1l_2l_3l_4}. \\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the spin and charge ( also commonly called _ orbital _ ) interaction matrices @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively , are @xmath18 matrices with indices @xmath19 . their explicit form is given by    @xmath20    [ eq : interactionmatrices ]    the rpa spin ( @xmath21 ) and charge ( @xmath22 ) susceptibilities for total spin zero",

    "we begin our study of the relationship between the matrix formulation of the rpa pairing interaction @xmath35 ( eq .

    "[ eq : paulisymmetry ] ) . in the diagrammatic expansion of @xmath33 we have in second order a term of the form @xmath52 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : combined](b ) . by symmetry",
    "this diagram corresponds to the first term in eq .",
    "[ eq : gamma1121 ] : @xmath53 the remaining contributions to @xmath49 ( eq . [ eq : gamma1121 ] ) are proportional to @xmath54 and @xmath55 respectively .",
    "as the interorbital coulomb repulsion preserves spin and orbital indices at each primitive vertex , a scheme based on only bubble and ladder diagrams leads to no contributions to @xmath49 .",

    "[ fig : combined](c ) ( left and right diagrams ) and have the meaning of vertex corrections in the standard diagrammatic expansion .",
    "we note that the same type of vertex correction diagrams appear in functional renormalization - group calculations for the multiorbital hubbard model  @xcite .    for higher orders , the feynman diagrams that contribute to @xmath56 consist of the familiar bubble and particle - hole ladder diagrams as well as diagrams that can be rewritten as vertex corrections arising from @xmath11 .",
    "examples of higher - order vertex contributions are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : vertcorr ] .",
    "note that there is a simple way to recognize the feynman diagrams that are included in the matrix - rpa : if one can assign the internal propagators into pairs , such that the first propagator is created at the same interaction vertex at which the second propagator is annihilated and vice versa , then each pair corresponds to the bare susceptibility as given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : baresuscep ] ) and the contribution of the considered feynman diagram to the pairing interaction can be entirely written in terms of the interactions and the bare susceptibilities .    if a hund s rule exchange @xmath13 and a _ pair hopping _",
    "term @xmath14 are included in the multi - orbital interaction ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) , the interaction part of the hamiltonian in real space is given by @xmath57 and additional vertex terms appear in the diagrammatic expansion of the pairing interaction .",
    "we analyze the contributions to the interorbital pair - scattering process following ref .",
    ": we retain only the diagonal terms of the bare susceptibilities @xmath58 with @xmath59 , assuming that other terms are suppressed by matrix element effects ( see also eq .",
    "[ eq : baregreensfunc ] ) .",
    "we find that the dominant second - order contribution ( @xmath60 ) to the pair - scattering term @xmath61 originates in equal parts from ladder and vertex diagrams  @xcite .",
    "summing higher - order terms as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : jp ] we obtain the dominant term linear in @xmath14 : @xmath62 which contributes to @xmath63 ( compare also to the results of the three - orbital matrix - rpa as discussed in ref .  ) . for inversion - symmetric systems the two contributions in eq .",
    "( [ eq : leadingtermjprime ] ) are equal , as the bare susceptibility ( eq . [ eq : baresuscep ] ) obeys @xmath64 .",
    "a numerical analysis of the importance of these interorbital pair - scattering terms @xmath61 , which we have shown to contain contributions arising from vertex correction diagrams , for a realistic model of the iron pnictides has recently been conducted by kemper _",

    "@xcite . there",
    ", the authors found that in the presence of a nonvanishing pair hopping these terms critically influence the nodal structure of the superconducting gap ( see also fig .",
    "9 of ref .  )",
    "moreover , another recent study by kontani and onari  @xcite has shown that exactly the same terms may play a role in enhancing the electron - phonon coupling .",
    "diagrams involving one factor of the pair hopping @xmath14 are summed they yield the leading @xmath14 result . ]",
    "based on a simple two - orbital hubbard model , we have analyzed the relationship between the matrix rpa and the feynman diagram technique for the calculation of the superconducting pairing interaction . in the single - orbital case ,",
    "the diagrams corresponding to the matrix - rpa have been found to have a simple well - known structure containing only bubble or ladder subunits . in the multiorbital case ,",
    "the interorbital coulomb interaction @xmath11 and an exchange pair - hopping interaction @xmath14 generate additional diagrams that , as we have shown , have the structure of vertex corrections .",
    "the matrix rpa in the context of the multiorbital hubbard model is therefore a significant generalization of the commonly used random phase approximation : it comprises infinite - order diagrams that can be written as products of the interactions and the bare susceptibilities .",
    "these include both the usual particle - hole bubble or ladder contributions , and the vertex corrections discussed here , all of which may be summed to infinite order in the usual rpa manner .",
    "we have therefore shown that the commonly used matrix rpa expression for the pairing vertex in the multiorbital hubbard model provides a hitherto unappreciated method to keep additional contributions to infinite order beyond rpa .",
    "these additional diagrams are important in view of recent studies , as they significantly influence the node structure of the superconducting gap function  @xcite and may also enhance phonon - mediated interactions  @xcite .",
