    "during recent years our faith in numerical calculations of properties of strongly interacting matter at high temperature and non - vanishing baryon number density greatly increased .",

    "they , however , allow to study the phase diagram and thermodynamic properties of matter in a regime accessible to heavy ion experiments and cover a regime that will be studied in future experiments planned at rhic and the gsi in germany to explore matter at high baryon number density .",

    "experimentally properties of hot and dense matter are studied in relativistic heavy ion collisions performed at cern and bnl .",
    "in particular , recent results from rhic experiments on on jet modifications and flow properties of matter created in au - au collisions suggest that in the collision of two heavy nuclei a dense medium is generated which equilibrates quickly after the collision at temperatures well above the transition temperature estimated in lattice calculations .",
    "a hot and dense system thus seems to be generated in the plasma phase of qcd ; once equilibrated it expands isentropically and cools down again .",
    "its constituents , quarks and gluons , then freeze - out , _ i.e. _ recombine to ordinary hadrons that become experimentally detectable . the relative abundances of various hadron species at freeze - out seem to be well described by a hadron resonance gas which allows to relate the observed particle yields to temperature and baryon chemical potential ( @xmath6 ) at freeze - out .",

    "the freeze - out temperature seems to be close to the transition temperature determined in lattice calculations @xcite . to quantify this agreement and",
    "the relation between freeze - out conditions and phase transitions also at larger values of @xmath0 is one of the challenges for experimental and theoretical studies of qcd thermodynamics .",
    "we will start our survey of lattice calculations of qcd thermodynamics in the next section by discussing recent studies of the qcd equation of state at vanishing chemical potential . in section 3",
    "we discuss the extension of these calculations to non - zero chemical potential .",
    "we conclude in section 4 .",
    "most information on the structure of the high temperature phase of qcd and the nature of the transition itself has been obtained through lattice calculations performed in the limit of vanishing baryon number density or , equivalently , vanishing quark chemical potential ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "this limit is most relevant for our understanding of the evolution of the early universe .",
    "it also corresponds to the regime which currently is studied experimentally in heavy ion collisions at rhic ( bnl ) and soon will be explored also at the lhc ( cern ) .",
    "the experimental accessibility of this regime of dense matter also asks for a thorough quantitative study of the qcd phase transition and of basic parameters that characterize the thermodynamics of dense matter at high temperature , e.g. the transition temperature @xmath1 and the energy density @xmath8 at this temperature .",
    "good quantitative control over the temperature dependence of basic quantities that characterize bulk properties of a thermal medium also is needed to extract the equation of state , @xmath9 , which controls the evolution of dense matter created in heavy ion collisions .",
    "we will in the following present some of the recent results on the qcd transition and the equation of state obtained in large scale numerical simulations of lattice regularized qcd .",
    "the transition to the high temperature phase of qcd is closely related to two fundamental properties of qcd - chiral symmetry breaking and confinement .",
    "in qcd at low temperature chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken ; the chiral condensate , obtained as the derivative of the logarithm of the qcd partition function , @xmath10 with respect to the quark mass , @xmath11 remains non - zero even in the limit of vanishing quark mass @xmath12 . in this limit the chiral condensate is an order parameter for the phase transition to the high temperature phase ; it is non - zero at low temperature and vanishes for temperatures larger than the transition temperature .",
    "lattice calculations give evidence for chiral symmetry restoration as is apparent from fig .",
    "[ fig : chiral](left ) which shows a recent analysis of @xmath13 performed for qcd with two light and a heavier strange quark mass as well as for qcd with three degenerate quark masses @xcite .",
    "although the transition is not a true phase transition but a smooth crossover , it clearly is signaled by a rapid change in the chiral condensate .",
    "the chiral transition also is deconfining , _",
    "i.e. _ at the transition temperature a large number of new degrees of freedom gets liberated .",
    "these degrees of freedom can be identified as quarks and gluons . at ( very ) high temperatures bulk thermodynamic observables resemble the behavior of an ideal quark - gluon gas , _",
    "i.e _ the pressure and energy density approach the corresponding stefan - boltzmann values , @xmath14 this becomes apparent when one compares , for instance , results for the temperature dependence of the pressure calculated in qcd with different number of quark species ( @xmath15 flavors ) . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : chiral](right ) the pressure rises rapidly at the transition temperature and at higher temperatures approaches ( slowly ) the stefan - boltzmann limit for an ideal gas with the relevant number of quark and gluon degrees of freedom .",
    "determining the transition temperature accurately is one of the basic goals of numerical studies of qcd thermodynamics .",
    "this involves several independent steps .",
    "first of all one has to determine the bare coupling , @xmath16 , at which the transition takes place , on a four dimensional lattice with fixed extent , @xmath17 , in the fourth direction .",
    "this determines the transition temperature in units of the lattice spacing @xmath18 . in a second step",
    "one has to determine the lattice spacing , @xmath19 , that corresponds to this value of the gauge coupling .",
    "this can be done by calculating another physical observable in lattice units that is known experimentally , e.g. a hadron mass , @xmath20 , or a phenomenologically known observable like the heavy quark potential .",
    "finally one has to increase the lattice extent @xmath17 and reduce the quark masses to perform a controlled extrapolation to the continuum limit with physical values of the quark masses . in fig .",
    "[ fig : tc ] we show results from an ongoing analysis @xcite that follows this program .",
    "shown there is the transition temperature expressed in terms of the square root of the string tension , @xmath21 , which characterizes the long distance behavior of the heavy quark potential , @xmath22 similar studies with almost physical light quark masses and a heavier strange quark mass have been performed recently by the milc collaboration @xcite .",
    "these analyses have been performed with significantly smaller quark masses and a smaller lattice spacing than earlier studies .",
    "they indicate that the transition temperature expressed in units of the string tension , @xmath23 , is in fact somewhat smaller than earlier estimates .",
    "nonetheless , recent studies of heavy quarkonium spectra , suggest a value for the string tension , @xmath24  mev , which is about 10% larger than values used previously to convert the qcd transition temperature to physical units .",
    "this leads to somewhat larger estimates for @xmath1 than the value @xmath25  mev used in the past .",
    "current estimates suggest a transition temperature of about @xmath26  mev for qcd with almost physical light quark masses and a heavier strange quark mass .",
    "as has been discussed in section @xmath27 we learn from the temperature dependence of the equation of state about the relevant degrees of freedom in the high temperature phase of qcd .",
    "reaching accurate quantitative results on the temperature dependence of pressure and energy density also is needed for the comparison of experimental results obtained in heavy ion collisions with theoretical calculations performed in equilibrium qcd .",
    "the dense system created in a heavy ion collision rapidly expands and cools down after its generation and equilibration .",
    "this expansion process may be described using hydrodynamic models . in these models",
    "the equation of state is a basic input .",
    "while earlier studies of the equation of state of qcd have been performed with rather heavy quark masses and large lattice spacings , recent studies significantly improved over this situation and allow to get better control over systematic effects arising from the use of unphysically large quark mass values as well as from the use of too coarse lattices .",
    "although the calculations with light quarks have still been performed in rather small physical volumes , @xmath28 , they do support earlier findings on the temperature dependence of the pressure and energy density in the transition region and also confirm that quark mass effects are small at high temperature .",
    "in particular , they show that the contribution of strange quarks , which have a mass of the order of the transition temperature , @xmath1 , has little influence on the thermodynamics in the vicinity of @xmath1 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pressure](left ) we compare the recent calculation of the pressure in ( 2 + 1)-flavor qcd @xcite and earlier results for 2-flavor qcd @xcite which both have been performed with unimproved staggered fermions .",
    "the good agreement in the vicinity of @xmath1 suggests that the strange quark contribution to the pressure is small . only for @xmath29 differences",
    "show up ; the positive strange quark contribution to the pressure in @xmath30-flavor qcd becomes sizeable .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : pressure](right ) we compare results for the energy density calculated in qcd with two light quark masses and a heavier strange quark mass @xcite with results obtained in 3-flavor qcd with a quark mass that rises with temperature but stays small on the scale given by the temperature , @xmath31 @xcite . the good agreement between these calculations",
    "is quite reassuring .",
    "these calculations confirm that thermodynamics in the high temperature phase is rather insensitive to changes of the quark mass ; a reduction of the light quark masses by almost an order of magnitude does not lead to drastic changes in the energy density at the transition point and in the high temperature phase .",
    "these recent calculations also show that the transition itself is not strongly influenced by discretization errors , which in the staggered fermion formulation show up prominently in the distortion of the light hadron spectrum ; reducing @xmath12 and thus the masses of light hadrons as well as reducing flavor symmetry breaking effects drastically @xcite does not significantly change the energy density at the transition temperature . the estimate , @xmath32 @xcite ,",
    "is consistent with the recent calculations in ( 2 + 1)-flavor qcd performed with lighter quark masses .",
    "the weak dependence of transition parameters on the quark mass can be understood in phenomenological models of the low temperature phase of qcd ; it seems to reflect the importance of numerous heavy resonances that are necessary to build up the particle and energy density needed for the transition to occur @xcite .    like earlier calculations with improved staggered fermions also",
    "the recent studies of the equation of state performed at vanishing quark chemical potential suggest that for physical values of the quark masses the transition to the high temperature phase of qcd only is a rapid crossover rather than a phase transition which on finite lattices would be signaled by metastabilities and a strong volume dependence of bulk thermodynamic observables or the chiral condensate .",
    "none of the calculations performed so far for qcd with two light quarks with or without the inclusion of a heavier strange quark gave direct evidence for a first order phase transition .     and",

    "calculations of bulk thermodynamic quantities for @xmath35 based on the reweighting approach @xcite , using the taylor expansion of the partition function @xcite , as well as analytic continuation of calculations performed with imaginary values of the chemical potential @xcite show that the @xmath0-dependent contributions to energy density and pressure are dominated by the leading order @xmath36 correction . for rhic energies , @xmath37 ,",
    "even this contribution is negligible .",

    "evidence for the existence of such a critical point may come from lattice calculations at non - zero quark chemical potential by either determining the location of lee - yang zeroes @xcite or by determining the convergence radius of the taylor series for the logarithm of the partition function which directly yields the pressure , @xmath66 @xcite .    if there exists a @xmath4 order phase transition point in the qcd phase diagram , this could be determined from an analysis of the volume dependence of lee - yang zeroes of the qcd partition function . in any finite volume zeroes of @xmath67",

    "it is related to the location of the critical point only if this singularity lies on the real axis .",
    "a sufficient condition for this is that all expansion coefficients in the taylor series are positive . for temperatures below the transition temperature at @xmath71",
    "this indeed seems to be the case for all expansion coefficients calculated so far .",
    "the first coefficient , @xmath72 , gives the pressure at @xmath38 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chiral](right ) and thus is positive for all temperatures .",

    "[ fig : pressure ] also the next - to - leading order coefficient , @xmath75 , is strictly positive .",
    "a new feature shows up in the expansion coefficients at @xmath76 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath77 is positive only below @xmath1 and changes sign in its vicinity .",
    "if this pattern persists for higher order expansion coefficients one may conclude that the irregular signs of the expansion coefficients for @xmath52 suggest that the radius of convergence of the taylor series is not related to critical behavior at these temperatures , whereas it determines a critical point for @xmath78 .",
    "ratios of subsequent expansion coefficients provide an estimate for the radius of convergence of the taylor expansion , @xmath79 the expansion coefficients @xmath80 for the quark number susceptibility have been analyzed recently for unimproved staggered fermions @xcite up to @xmath47 .",
    "it has been shown that an accurate determination of these expansion coefficients requires large physical volumes .",
    "based on a finite volume analysis the radius of convergence has been estimated from the taylor series of the quark number susceptibility to be @xmath81  mev @xcite . as the expansion coefficients @xmath80 are directly related to the expansion coefficients @xmath82 of the pressure the radius of convergence coincides in the limit @xmath83 . for finite @xmath84 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath85 , estimates based on the taylor series for the pressure will be about 30% higher than those based on the taylor series for susceptibilities . in any case ,",
    "current estimates for the location of the critical point in the qcd phase diagram differ quite a bit and these calculations need to be refined in the future .",
    "we have presented recent results obtained on the qcd equation of state at vanishing and non - vanishing quark chemical potential .",
    "these calculations now can be performed with an almost realistic quark mass spectrum . at vanishing chemical potential one",
    "now can start a systematic analysis of lattice artefacts which allows a controlled extrapolation of lattice results on the equation of state and the transition temperature to the continuum limit .",
    "also studies of the qcd phase diagram at non - zero quark chemical potential made significant progress in recent years .",
