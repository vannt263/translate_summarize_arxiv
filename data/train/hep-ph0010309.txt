    "in @xcite i have proposed an alternative approach to qcd analysis of @xmath3 , and by implication to any hard process involving initial photon , which differs substantially from the conventional one .",
    "it builds in part on arguments advocated for a long time by the authors of @xcite and agrees with the approach to calculations of direct photon production at hera pursued in @xcite .",
    "this alternative approach is based on two ingredients :    * clear and systematic separation of genuine qcd effects from those of pure qed origin , which leads to unambiguous and universal definition of the concepts `` leading '' and `` next  to  leading '' order of qcd .",
    "* acknowledgement of the fact that parton distribution functions ( pdf ) of the photon are proportional to @xmath4 and not , as assumed in the conventional approach , to @xmath1 .",
    "the general expression for @xmath5 has the following structure @xmath6 where quark nonsinglet and singlet and gluon distribution functions satisfy the evolution equations @xmath7 where @xmath8 .",
    "the splitting and coefficient functions @xmath9 can be expanded in powers of @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) as @xmath12 , \\label{splitquark } \\\\",
    "k_g(x , m ) & = & \\frac{\\alpha}{2\\pi}\\left [ a(m)k_g^{(1)}(x)+a^2(m)k^{(2)}_g(x)+\\cdots\\;\\right ] , \\label{splitgluon}\\\\ p_{ij}(x , m ) & = & a(m)p^{(0)}_{ij}(x)+   a^2(m ) p_{ij}^{(1)}(x)+\\cdots , \\label{splitpij}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath13 where the lowest order coefficient functions @xmath14 and @xmath15 @xmath16 + 8x(1-x)-1 \\label{c0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] are unique differs slightly from ( [ c0 ] ) . ] and due entirely to qed coupling of the initial photon to the primary @xmath17 pair .",
    "it is their presence what distinguishes hard collisions of photons from those of hadrons .",
    "in @xcite i have discussed conceptual as well as numerical differences between the results obtained within the conventional and alternative approaches for the pointlike part of @xmath18 in the nonsinglet channel and under the simplifying assumption @xmath19 . in this talk",
    "i will concentrate on proper definitions of the concepts `` leading order '' ( lo ) and `` next  to  leading order '' ( nlo ) of qcd and on the discussion of their implications for charm contribution @xmath20 to photon structure function , recently measured at lep @xcite .",
    "although the definition of the concepts `` lo '' and `` nlo '' in hard collisions of photons is a matter of convention , it is preferable to define them in a way that retains the same basic content these concepts have in collisions of leptons and hadrons",
    ". let me recall , for instance , their meaning in the case of the familiar ratio @xmath21 the prefactor @xmath22 multiplied by unity in the brackets of ( [ rlarge ] ) comes purely from qed , whereas genuine qcd effects are contained in @xmath23 , which is given as expansion in powers of @xmath10 as @xmath24 .",
    "\\label{rsmall}\\ ] ] for the quantity ( [ rlarge ] ) it is a generally accepted practice to include @xmath25 in theoretical expressions but disregard it when defining the `` lo '' and `` nlo '' of qcd . for instance",
    ", the nlo approximation of ( [ rlarge ] ) implies retaing _ first two _ terms in ( [ rsmall ] ) , i.e. the _ first three _ terms in ( [ rlarge ] ) .",
    "let me emphasize that only if at least first two nontrivial powers of @xmath10 in ( [ rlarge ] ) are taken into account can this trunctated expansion be associated with a well - defined renormalization scheme . and",
    "it is this association what makes in my view the essential feature of the concept `` nlo qcd approximation '' .",
    "the same convention should be adopted for all physical quantities getting contributions from pure qed .",
    "i think it is preferable to use the terminology that avoids potential confusion which might arise from mixing orders of @xmath10 and @xmath4 .",
    "note that for both @xmath26 and @xmath20 , discussed in the next section , the purely qed contributions @xmath25 and @xmath27 are finite and unique and there is thus no reason why they should be treated differently as far as the definitions of the `` lo '' and `` nlo '' of qcd are concerned .",
    "the implications of the above considerations for @xmath5 are the following :    * as shown in @xcite the lo qcd expression for @xmath18 contains in addition to terms included in the conventional lo analysis of @xmath18 ( i.e. those proportional to @xmath14 and @xmath28 ) , also terms involving @xmath29 and @xmath30 . as all these functions are known , there is , however , no obstacle to performing such an analysis . as shown in @xcite for the pointlike part of @xmath5 in the nonsinglet channel , the results in these two approaches are numerically significantly different , the single most important contribution to this difference coming from @xmath31 .",
    "the coefficient function @xmath32 enters @xmath18 already at the lo due to the fact that it does so in the convolution with purely qed part of quark distribution function of the photon , which has no analogue in hadronic collisions . *",
    "the nlo qcd analysis of @xmath5 requires the knowledge of two quantities , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , that have not yet been calculated and thus is at the moment impossible to perform .",
    "note , that in the conventional approach @xmath15 , which has nothing to do with qcd , appears only at the `` nlo '' , and @xmath31 , which involves evaluation of feynman diagrams with a single qcd vertex is not used even there !    for clear and unambiguous definition of the terms",
    "`` lo '' ( `` nlo '' ) it is thus vital to agree on the basic criterion , namely that they refer to perturbative expansions of physical quantities retaining the first ( first two ) _ nontrivial _ powers of @xmath10 .",
    "the purely qed contribution to @xmath5 is irelevant from this point of view , but may be retained for comparison with experiment as it actually dominates scaling violations of @xmath35 in most of accessible range of @xmath36 . to identify genuine qcd effects one has to look for subtler effects than the dominant @xmath37 rise , like , for instance , the @xmath36-dependence of the slope @xmath38 compared to @xmath39 , for which scaling violations are due entirely to qcd effects , the nonzero slope ( [ a ] ) is by itself no sign of qcd effects , as these are given by the difference @xmath40 .",
    "[ slopes ] , based on numbers taken from @xcite , shows that for @xmath41 the precision of currently available data is insufficient to identify genuine qcd effects , although some indication of the turnover to negative @xmath42 , expected theoretically , is visible there .",
    "the qcd analysis of @xmath20 in the region @xmath44 provides possibly the simplest illustration of the differences between the conventional and alternative approches to hard collisions of photons @xcite , since @xmath45 is dominated in this region by the direct photon contribution , @xmath46 , which does not involve any pdf .",
    "it can be written as @xmath47 where the coefficients @xmath48 are calculable in perturbative qcd and the lowest order term @xmath49 comes from pure qed diagram in fig .",
    "[ ggnnlo]a . in the conventional approach",
    "the `` nlo '' approximation of the direct photon contribution is defined @xcite by taking the first two terms in ( [ dir ] ) including the purely qed contribution @xmath50 . however , as argued in the preceding section , this definition does not have the basic attribute of genuine nlo qcd approximation . the inclusion of direct photon contributions of the order @xmath51 , coming from diagrams like those in fig .",
    "[ ggnnlo]e , g is vital not only for establishing the genuine nlo character of the direct photon contribution itself , but also for ensuring @xcite factorization scale invariance of the full expression for @xmath45 .",
    "the latter involves adding the resolved photon contributions up to the order @xmath51 , coming from diagrams like those in fig .",
    "[ ggnnlo]f , h , j .",
    "the alternative approach to qcd analysis of @xmath18 , proposed recently by the author , differs substantially and in a number of aspects from the conventional one .",
    "it satisfies factorization scale invariance in a way that does not rely on physically untenable assumption that quark distribution functions of the photon behave as @xmath52 .",
    "the simplest implications of this difference are illustrated on the case of charm contribution to @xmath5 , recently measured at lep .",
    "to be useful phenomenologically the proposed approach needs to be further elaborated by extending it to the singlet sector and merging it with the hadronic contributions .",
    "work on this program is in progress .",
    "the nlo qcd analysis in the proposed approach requires evaluation of several so far unknown quantities and is thus currently impossible to perform . in view of the quality and number of experimental data on @xmath18 ,",
    "this is at the moment no serious drawback and a complete lo qcd analysis seems sufficient for phenomenological purposes .",
