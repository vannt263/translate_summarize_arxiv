    "the physics of the condensed matter and materials science in the last couple of decades has been largely dominated by the mesoscopic and nano - scale systems  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the advancement of lithographic techniques together with the use of the instruments such as the scanning tunnel microscope ( stm ) has enabled experimentalists to examine the physical properties of tailor made geometries and test their potential as future nano - electronic devices .",
    "such studies have been important not only from the point of view of possible applications , but also due to the fact that they play a crucial role in understanding the effect of quantum coherence in the electronic transport as the size of the system is reduced below the phase coherence length of the electrons  @xcite .    a large section of the existing literature in this field deals with the effect of the quantum dots ( qd ) , single , or an array of them , coupled from a side , on the spectral and transport properties of quantum nano - wires ( qw ) or quantum rings ( qr )  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the studies include the investigation of the effect of inter - dot coupling in a side coupled double dot system  @xcite , the tunability of the fano - kondo effect in a double qd unit  @xcite , and a variety of phase coherent electronic transport studies  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the theoretical studies , in several cases , have been motivated by eperiments on electronic transport in qw systems that were coupled to qd s from a side  @xcite .",
    "one ubiquitous phenomenon that is manifestly evident in all such studies on quantum transport is the occurrence of fano effect  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the fano effect arises when a bound state ` interacts ' with a continuum , and is typically observed in the transmission spectrum of one dimensional qw systems when a single qd , or a cluster of them is attached to the qw from one side  @xcite . the transmission spectrum is marked with asymmetric lineshapes dictated by the formula  @xcite , @xmath0 where , @xmath1 with @xmath2 being the ` resonance energy ' and @xmath3 the line width .",
    "@xmath4 is the asymmetry parameter .",
    "inspite of the considerable volume of work existing in this field , a practically unaddressed issue , to the best of our knowledge , is how seriously does the presence of a _ bound state _ caused by the attachment ( from one side ) of a qd or an assembly of them , influence a singular continuous spectrum .",
    "the localized state(s ) can in principle , be seated anywhere in the spectrum , and a singular continuous spectrum having a multifractal distribution of gaps may be severly affected by these .",
    "this is the central motivation behind the present work .",
    "we choose to work with a fibonacci quasiperiodic chain that is a classic example of a _ one dimensional _ quasicrystal presenting a singular continuous spectrum  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "qusicrystals have been established as the third _ ordered _ phase of the solid state  @xcite .",
    "these are systems that are intermediate between a perfectly periodic system , and a completely random one . over almost three decades",
    ", the physical properties of these strange systems have remained under active consideration , both from the standpoints of fundamental physics , and technological applications  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "spectral properties of a fibonacci quasicrystal ( fqc ) are exotic . for example , its energy spectrum , in general , is singular continuous ( a cantor set ) with measure zero .",
    "the spectrum exhibits a variety of scaling behavior  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the wave functions are neither periodic in the bloch sense , nor are they exponentially localized as it happens in a completely random sequence of potentials  @xcite .",
    "such peculiarities in the spectral properties have prompted researchers to propose and investigate realistic problems related to the localization of light in quasiperiodically ordered layered dielectrics  @xcite , flux pinning  @xcite , quasiperiodic optical lattices  @xcite-@xcite , plasmon excitation in aperiodically ordered dielectric layers  @xcite , and many other cases .",
    "experiments have also been performed to test the basic predictions of a purely one dimensional theory and to explore the novelties of these systems  @xcite .",
    "the present day nanotechnology makes it possible to fabricate a lattice of qd s , and quantum wells with practically any desired geometry .",
    "even stable and rigid ( carbon ) atomic chains have been experimentally realized  @xcite .",
    "in several recent communications , aperiodically ordered metal nano - particle arrays  @xcite-@xcite , and aperiodic arrays of qd s  @xcite have been addressed . in every case",
    ", the quasiperiodic backbone plays a key role in controlling the physical properties of the system .    such an environment has inspired us to undertake a detailed investigation in exploring the role of qd s side coupled to a fibonacci quasiperiodic atomic chain .",
    "the dots are the _ single level _",
    "qd s in the spirit of kubala and knig  @xcite , and are attached to a subset of atomic sites in an infinite chain ( fig .  [",
    "lattice1]a ) .",
    "the results are quite extraordinary . using a tight binding hamiltonian for non - interacting , spinless electrons and a real space renormalization group ( rsrg ) scheme ,",
    "we show that , when a single atomic site ( equivalent to a single level qd ) is attached to each of a subset of sites in the fqc , the energy spectrum can exhibit _ absolutely continuous _",
    "sub - bands depending on the strength of the coupling of the side coupled atomic site to the fibonacci backbone .",
    "the coupling represents the _ proximity _ of the adatom to the backbone , which can be controlled at will .",
    "there are other instances when the presence of adatoms can give rise to resonant ( extended ) eigenstates which were never present in the purely one dimensional model . as a result , a state that was _ critical _",
    "@xcite in the purely @xmath5-d case , may turn out to be a resonant tunneling one , with a suitable proximity of the adatoms .",
    "the matrix maps  @xcite , typical of a fibonacci sequence , are also controlled by the proximity of the adatoms .",
    "such observations provide the first step towards answering the basic questions raised regarding the influence of bound states on a singular continuous spectrum .",
    "consequently , the side coupled dots have profound effect on the two terminal electronic transport across a fibonacci nanocluster .",
    "the system can be be useful in designing possible tunnel devices with a quasiperiodic backbone .    in what follows , we describe our results .",
    "section ii contains the model and the principal methods of investigation . in section",
    "iii we present the numerical results and discussion .",
    "section iv elaborates the role of the adatom - backbone coupling in controlling the six cycles of the matrix map , and conclusions are drawn in section v.",
    "to describe the system we use a tight - binding framework . in wannier basis",
    "the hamiltonian reads , @xmath6   \\label{equ1}\\ ] ] where , @xmath7 is the on - site energy of an electron at the site @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the nearest - neighbor hopping strength .",
    "a binary fibonacci chain comprising of two letters @xmath10 and @xmath11 is grown recursively following the growth rule  @xcite @xmath12 , and @xmath13 , beginning with @xmath10 .",
    "the fibonacci family in successive generations appear as , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and so on .",
    "we consider the letters @xmath10 and @xmath11 to represent two kinds of _ bonds_. the on - site potential @xmath18 takes on three values depending on its nearest neighbor configuration , viz , it is @xmath19 when flanked by two @xmath10-bonds on both sides , @xmath20 when it is between a @xmath21 pair , and @xmath22 for the @xmath23 combination ( see fig .",
    "[ lattice1](a ) ) .",

    "the tunnel hopping , connecting a fibonacci site and the adatom will be designated by @xmath26 .",
    "the on - site potential of the side coupled dot is @xmath27 .      for the sake of completeness , let us remind ourselves the basics of the problem of determination of the eigenvalue spectrum and the eigenfunctions of a purely one dimensional fqc .",
    "it is efficiently handled by the transfer matrices @xmath28 corresponding to the @xmath29th generation fibonacci approximant  @xcite .",
    "the matrices of three consecutive generations are recursively coupled through the relation , @xmath30 with @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33  @xcite .",
    "the transfer matrices for the individual sites read , @xmath34    the _ allowed _ eigenvalues are obtained from the condition @xmath35 as @xmath36 , where , @xmath37 , and is obtained recursively from the equation @xmath38 with appropriate initial values of @xmath39 depending on the model  @xcite .",
    "it is well known  @xcite-@xcite that , as the generation index @xmath36 , every energy that one hits upon , corresponds to an escaping orbit of the trace map eq .",
    "[ map ] , and the spectrum turns into a cantor set with a gap in the vicinity of every energy .",
    "such a spectrum corresponds to eigenfunctions thar are neither _ localized _ in an exponential way , nor are they _ extended _ in the bloch sense .",
    "this fact is mathematically described by an _ invariant _ quantity given by , @xmath40 the above invariant becomes equal to zero for a perfectly periodic chain of atoms , while it is infinitely large when one calculates it for a randomly disordered 1-d lattice .",
    "zero _ of the fibonacci invariant thus corresponds to extended eigenfunctions  @xcite , a fact that is crucial for our case .",
    "the self similarity inherent in the fqc structure makes the use of a real space renormalization group ( rsrg ) decimation scheme a natural choice to unravel the spectral features .",
    "the scheme is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ lattice1 ] .",
    "first , the side coupled qd s are ` folded ' in to the @xmath41-sites to create effective @xmath42-sites with potential @xmath43 .",

    "[ lattice1](b ) .",
    "the @xmath44-sites are then decimated to obtain a scaled version of the original chain , as shown in fig .",
    "[ lattice1](c ) .",

    "the leads are modeled in the tight binding scheme by a uniform on - site potential @xmath56 ( set equal to zero everywhere in this calculation ) , and a constant nearest neighbor hopping integral @xmath57 ( set equal to unity throughout ) .",

    "we obtain @xmath76 .",
    "this gives us a measure of the _ proximity _ of the adatom for which one should get extended eigenstates in a fqc irrespective of energy .",

    "it is to be appreciated that , this value of @xmath68 is the same as obtained by forcing the inavariant to vanish .",

    "the energy band in this case consists of continuous distribution of eigenvalues with a gap separating the continuous sub - clusters . as a result of the commutation  eq.[comm ] , the electron will ` feel ' no essential difference of the fqc with an ordered binary alloy , and the energy spectra of the original fqc should therefore be identical to that of a periodic arrangement of the constituent clusters @xmath42 and @xmath80 placed in an alternating fashion . _",
    "continuous subbands of extended states _ in the spectrum , when @xmath76 , is therefore an obvious result for the stubbed fqc .    to confirm this we present in fig .",

    ". for @xmath87 there appears a notable change in the spectrum compared to the usual three - subband spectrum of a standard fqc  @xcite .",
    "the sub - bands get shifted and the eigenvalues cluster in a different shape .",
    "there is a central peak at @xmath88 that corresponds to a sharply localized eigenstate , and is a consequence of the attachment of the adatoms . but otherwise , the spectrum retains the typical fragmented , self similar character of a 1-d fqc .",
    "the remarkable part of the figure is the case with @xmath89 which corresponds to @xmath75 .",
    "the spectrum is _ absolutely continuous _ within two sub - bands .",
    "the central localized state remains pinned at @xmath88 however .",
    "two additional localized states show up immediately beyond the sub - bands on either side . the overall spectral character has been cross checked by explicitly working out the trace map .",
    "the completely gapless character of the spectrum in the range @xmath90 and @xmath91 suggests that one should have all the eigenstates extended in these energy regimes when @xmath89 .",
    "the recursion relations eq .  [ recursion ] reconfirm the extendedness of an eigenstate corresponding to an eigenvalue falling within the continuum in the spectrum .",
    "the hopping integrals @xmath24 and @xmath25 remain non - zero under successive rsrg iteration for an indefinite number of loops if the chosen energy is picked up from within the continuum .",
    "this implies that , at any length scale there is a non - zero connectivity betweeen the neighboring sites at that scale , and hence the corresponding state is of extended character  @xcite .",
    "before we end this subsection , it s important to appreciate that , the origin of the continuous bands of extended states is the commutation of the matrices @xmath92 , and @xmath93 .",
    "therefore , any quasiperiodic , or even disordered geometric arrangement of @xmath41 ( coupled to a single adatom ) , and the @xmath94 pair , under suitable conditions such as the above will lead to an identical energy spectrum and hence , extended eigenstates .",
    "we have tested this with other kinds of aperiodic chains which under rsrg give rise to various kinds of recursion relations between the hamiltonian parameters . in every case , the bands with @xmath89 is the same . in this respect , such microscopically",
    "different aperiodic geometries can be brought under one _ universality class _ , using a suitable side coupled array of qd s .",
    "the transport behavior of course , is sensitive to the recursion relations , and its structural details will be different",
    ".      a major concern from the standpoint of an experimentalist will be the stability of the continuum against a possible deviation of @xmath68 from its exact numerical value as obtained from eq .",
    "[ invariant2 ] , or a variance in the value of @xmath27 .",
    "this is related to any error in fixing up the exact proximity of the adatom to the @xmath41-sites , or an error in controlling the potential of the attached qd by a gate voltage . to this end",
    ", we have extensively studied the avdos spectrum by varying @xmath68 from its value of @xmath86 . for large deviations from @xmath89 ,",
    "the spectrum gets back to the familiar three sub - band cantor set like structure typical to a fqc .",
    "however , for small deviations the continua persist , though with a ruggedness in the landscape , which becomes more and more dominant with increasing value of @xmath68 .    to illustrate ,",
    "we have shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the avdos for @xmath95 , @xmath85 ( top ) , and for @xmath89 , @xmath96 ( bottom ) for the entire range of the spectrum .",
    "these values are deviations by @xmath97 from the _ critical _ values , viz , @xmath89 , or @xmath85 .",
    "the smooth avdos observed in fig.[avdos ] ( bottom ) gets distorted by numerous oscillations in fig .",
    "but , the continuous distribuion of eigenvalues still persists over smaller energy intervals .",
    "the patches of continua are also observed to survive even when the deviation is as large as @xmath98 from either @xmath89 , or @xmath85 , or even when both the parameters vary within a reasonable uncertainty in their values .",
    "this stability is also reflected in the amplitude distribution along the fqc backbone ( fig .",
    "[ figampli ] ) .",
    "the energy is chosen to be @xmath99 , that is , from within a continuous subband .",
    "oscillating but non - decaying profile of the amplitudes for arbitrarily large system size is observed .",
    "we have shown ( top panel ) the result for @xmath100 sites , with @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath84 , and for @xmath89 . in the bottom panel",
    "we present the case where the fqc - adatom hopping @xmath68 deviates by @xmath97 from its _ critical _ value of @xmath89 .",
    "the extendedness prevails over extremely large system size , though we again show the results for just @xmath100 sites here .",
    "thus , even within the natural experimental uncertainty , it should be possible to observe a crossover in the transport characteristics from the poorly conducting to a metallic one in a fibonacci array with side coupled quantum dots , by controlling the proximity , or the potential of the dots with respect to the backbone .",
    "the obervations made in the density of states spectrum are corroborated by the corresponding calculation of the transmission coefficient of finite but arbitrarily large systems using eq .",
    "[ transmission ] . in fig .",
    "[ transport ] we present the transmission spectra for @xmath103 ( fig .  [ transport](a ) , no side atoms ) , @xmath87 ( fig .",

    "the three sub - band clustering of the pure fqc in ( a ) evolves into a four sub - band form . @xmath89",
    "clearly shrinks the entire spectrum into two continuous zones of high transmission coefficients .",
    "the sharply localized state at @xmath88 of course , never contributes .",
    "this reflects what we have already discussed in the context of the density of states .",
    "extended eigenstates can also be traced which are related to a six cyclic behavior of the matrix map viz , @xmath105 , @xmath106  @xcite- @xcite . in a previous work  @xcite",
    "it has been shown that a six cycle of the matrix map given by eq .",
    "[ matrixmap ] is caused by resonances occuring in the clusters @xmath107 , @xmath108 in the bare length scale , or through the resonances taking place in pairs like @xmath109 , @xmath110 in one step renormalized lattice .",
    "bigger clusters are easily identified from higher order renormalized version of the fqc .    as already mentioned , in the six cyclic cases , @xmath111 , for one or more special values of energy .",
    "the value of @xmath29 determines the length scale at which the six cycle of the map begins to show up , and depends on the construction of the resonating clusters  @xcite .",

    "@xmath114 denotes the stage of renormalization , and it provides the length scale at which the resonating clusters are identified .    in the fqc with attached qd s , the six cycle energies can be obtained almost at will by fixing the adatom at suitable places in the original lattice .",

    "[ first ] and  [ second ] simultaneously . by choosing @xmath120 , eq .",
    "[ first ] provides @xmath121 which is independent of @xmath68 .",
    "this energy value can be made equal to that obtained from the second equation , viz , eq .",
    "[ second ] by choosing @xmath122 .",
    "this gives an estimate of the _ proximity _ of an adatom to the @xmath41-sites in the original lattice that will be leading to six cycles of the matrix maps at special values of energies .",
    "we have extracted numerous such energy values from various scales of length .",
    "each such energy corresponds to an extended eigenstate of the system in the sense that , the hopping integrals remain non - zero for an indefinite number of rsrg iterations .",
    "in conclusion , we have examined the consequence of an interaction between bound states and a singular continuous energy spectrum by fixing isolated single level quantum dots as adatoms on specific lattice points of an infinite quasi - periodic fibonacci array of atomic sites .",
    "the energy spectrum of system exhibits a remarkable transformation from a completely fragmented cantor set nature with measure zero to one with continuous distribution of eigenvalues , similar to that of an ordered binary alloy , by judiciously choosing the qd - fqc tunnel hopping .",
    "one thus achieves an _ almost insulating _ to a metallic behavior of the system when the fermi energy is located at suitable parts of the spectrum .",
    "the spectral crossover is found to be robust against a possible variation in the values of the tunnel hopping integral , or the potential of the adatoms .",
    "other established properties of a fqc are also inspected and are found to be sensitive to the values of the tunnel hopping which gives us an estimate of the proximity of the adatoms to the lattice .",
    "the two terminal transmission coefficient is evaluated using the standard recursive algorithm , and has been shown to corroborate our findings regarding the energy spectrom of sun a stubbed fibonacci array of quantum dots .",
    "detailed analysis of the system at different scales of length can be made utilizing the real space renormalization group methods .",
