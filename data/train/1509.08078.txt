    "a common feature of many - body systems is the presence of collective modes in their excitation spectra . particularly interesting",
    "are those which can be interpreted in terms of vibrations . in nuclei",
    ", they have been known for a long time@xcite and are observed both in the low  lying and in the higher  energy region ( giant resonances ( gr))@xcite .",
    "another example of collective vibrations is the dipole plasmon resonance in metallic clusters@xcite , a very collective mode which is the analogue of the nuclear dipole gr and is due to the vibration of the center of mass of the delocalized valence electrons against that of the positive ions .    in all these cases ,",
    "several characteristic properties are rather well reproduced within the random  phase approximation ( rpa ) , which is for this reason considered a good microscopic theory for the study of collective states in many - body systems@xcite . among its merits",
    ", we mention that the rpa preserves the energy  weighted sum rules ( ewsr ) , in the sense of the thouless theorem@xcite .",
    "this feature is very important because it guarantees that spurious states associated with broken symmetries are exactly separated in rpa from the physical states of the system .    on the other hand , the rpa model has some limits . among them",
    "we recall that , by construction , it predicts a perfectly harmonic spectrum and can not reproduce the spreading width of the excited modes . as underlined in several studies , the coupling of one particle",
    " one hole ( 1p-1h ) configurations with more complex states is very important to overcome these limitations and to describe the spreading widths and the anharmonicities in the excitation spectra ( see , for example refs.@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a natural extension of the rpa is the so ",
    "called second rpa ( srpa ) , which amounts to enlarge the space of basic elementary excitations by including two particle  two hole ( 2p-2h ) configurations and by coupling them with the 1p-1h ones and among themselves .",
    "it was shown@xcite that the ewsr are exactly the same in srpa and in rpa .",
    "recent applications of the srpa model were performed without any cut and approximations in the matrices .",
    "such applications provided a very strong modification ( a large downwards energy shift ) of the rpa excitation spectra , also for those collective states whose description within the rpa is rather good .",
    "this was obtained for collective nuclear excitations with skyrme and gogny forces@xcite , as well as with an interaction derived from the argonne v18 nucleon - nucleon potential with the unitary correlation operator method@xcite . in the case of metallic clusters , within the jellium model@xcite , the modifications found when passing from rpa to srpa are very large@xcite and completely spoil the quality of the rpa results concerning the dipole strength distribution . in this application , the limiting case of highly ionized clusters is very striking .",
    "the rpa is able to reproduce the exact theoretical prediction on the position of the dipole plasmon excitation ( at the mie energy ) and the fact that the dipole strength is totally concentrated at this energy@xcite .",
    "these very nice features are completely lost in srpa@xcite . in the nuclear case",
    ", one might associate such unpleasant result to some inadequacy of the used nuclear interaction",
    ". this could be especially true for the skyrme and gogny  based srpa calculations because some matrix elements appearing in srpa are not present at the rpa level , for instance those with three particle and one hole or three hole and one particle indexes .",
    "therefore , they do not enter at all in the fitting procedure used to fix the parameters of the effective interaction .",
    "furthermore , a certain amount of correlations is already contained in an effective way in the parameters of these phenomenological forces , because the adjustment of the parameters is performed with mean  field calculations . when correlations are explicitly introduced in models beyond the mean field , double ",
    "counting problems may arise .",
    "finally , skyrme and gogny forces contain zero  range terms and this produces in some cases a cutoff  dependence in beyond ",
    "mean  field models .",
    "however , the problem of the large downwards energy shift exists also in the case of metallic clusters@xcite where there is no cutoff dependence and the coulomb interaction does not contain any parameter@xcite . the origin of the problem must then be different .",
    "in deriving the equations of motion in srpa@xcite use is made , as in rpa , of the quasi ",
    "boson approximation ( qba ) and it has been argued@xcite that its use in srpa is even more questionable than in rpa .",
    "recently , this was more precisely understood as related to the replacement of the correlated ground state with the hartree ",
    "fock ( hf ) one , that is generated by the use of the qba . this replacement produces a violation of the stability condition at the srpa level@xcite .",
    "a careful analysis of the merits and limits of the srpa was presented in ref.@xcite .",
    "in particular , the violation of the stability condition in srpa@xcite is illustrated and a generalization of the thouless theorem@xcite is proven in the case where a correlated ground state is used . very recently , a subtraction procedure able to remove the double counting in beyond  mean  field theories based on effective interactions@xcite was applied to the srpa case@xcite .",
    "reference@xcite showed explicitly that this subtraction method is also able to ensure the stability condition in extended rpa models such as the srpa . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "very encouraging results were found for both low  lying and higher  energy excitations . in particular , the strong srpa downward shift is corrected for those states having a dominant 1p-1h nature such as the giant resonances , and the found results are in much better agreement with the experimental ones , compared to the standard srpa results .    in ref.@xcite ,",
    "an extension of the srpa including correlations in the ground state was tested by applying it to a solvable model and by comparing the results with the exact ones .",
    "it was also applied to metallic clusters@xcite , finding much better results than in srpa .",
    "however , such an extended srpa is very demanding from a computational point of view and its application to the study of atomic nuclei is hardly feasible .    on the other hand , approaches like the particle ",
    "vibration coupling@xcite , where one uncorrelated particle - hole configuration is coupled to a correlated collective mode , do not suffer from the violation of the stability condition @xcite encountered in srpa .",
    "they are however also affected by the cutoff dependence and the double  counting problems if phenomenological zero  range interactions are employed .",
    "extensions of rpa including multiphonon excitations have been applied in several contexts .",
    "they make use of mapping procedures to replace the fermion particle - hole operators by their boson images@xcite .",
    "the limits of such procedure were tested in ref.@xcite within a solvable model , by comparing the exact results with those obtained by truncating the mapping at different levels .",
    "it was shown that in order to correct for the violations of the pauli principle , higher  order terms are required in the boson expansion .",
    "this makes not feasible the application of the approach to realistic systems .",
    "the procedure presented in refs.@xcite allows one to enlarge iteratively the space in which the hamiltonian is diagonalized by including multiphonon states built by tamm - dancoff phonon operators remaining in the fermion space .",
    "the approach that we are going to present consists in considering the rpa collective fermion operators as building blocks to construct the space of states by acting repeatedly on the rpa ground state ( that is , the vacuum of the rpa operators ) .",
    "the hamiltonian is then diagonalized in such space . since the fermionic structure of the collective elementary excitations is fully accounted for , one may expect to get satisfactory enough results with a basis of states containing up to two such elementary excitations .",
    "thus , one considers , as in srpa , a space containing 1p-1h and 2p-2h configurations , the latter appearing only through the two rpa phonon states .",
    "since the 2p-2h sector of the basis space is built with those collective excitations which already contain some effects of the residual interaction , one might envisage to reduce the dimensions of the space by including only some configurations selected , for example , on the basis of their collectivity . when studying the excitation spectrum one may introduce an energy cutoff and consider only those basis vectors",
    "whose rpa energy is lower .",
    "this would allow one to reduce the heavy computational effort often required within the srpa .",
    "this approach is very much related to that of refs.@xcite .",
    "it is however to be noted that in such references tamm dancoff phonons were used to construct the basis states by acting on the uncorrelated hf ground state .",
    "we consider here rpa operators acting on the correlated rpa ground state .",
    "therefore , even considering the mixing of configurations containing up to two phonons , we take into account higher  order excitations .",
    "we call our model double rpa and use in what follows the acronym drpa to denote it .",
    "the approach is described in the next section .",
    "the energy  weighted sum rules are shown to be satisfied in sec .",
    "iii , and applications to the nucleus @xmath0o are presented in sec .",
    "iv . finally , in sec . v we draw some conclusions .",

    "the excitation phonon operators are generalized to @xmath18 which contain 2p-2h components in addition to the 1p-1h ones .",

    "this discrepancy with the experimental values may be understood as due to the almost pure 2p2h nature of the low  lying 0@xmath74 and 2@xmath74 states .",
    "the implicit inclusion of 2p2h configurations induced by the drpa is not enough to well describe these excitations , and higher  order calculations would be necessary .",
