    "the motion of a classical particle in a billiard system can show regular , chaotic or intermediate behavior , depending on the billiard geometry .",

    "level dynamics additionally observes eigenvalues in dependence of an external parameter .",
    "pechukas @xcite and yukawa @xcite established the formal analogy between a one - dimensional classical gas and a perturbed quantum system @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the hamiltonian of the unperturbed system , and @xmath6 is a perturbation . here",
    ", the change of the eigenvalues @xmath7 with the parameter @xmath8 is governed by the same  equations of motion  as the positions @xmath9 of the gas particles propagating with time @xmath8 . in this picture ,",
    "a chaotic system can be described as a one - dimensional gas of particles with repulsive long - range interactions between them .",
    "an integrable system , on the other hand , refers to an ideal gas with no interaction or one close to zero , when tunneling effects are taken into account @xcite .",
    "the same equations of motion as for the pechukas - yukawa gas have been derived for the billiard system under the shift @xmath10 of a billiard wall @xcite , where @xmath10 ( or the length of the billiard @xmath11 ) refers to the time @xmath8 .    in this paper , we are interested in the level dynamics of two - dimensional pseudointegrable billiards @xcite .",
    "examples are polygons with only rational angles @xmath12 , with @xmath13 and at least one @xmath14 .",
    "they are characterized by their genus number @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the number of angles and @xmath17 is the least common multiple of the @xmath18 .",
    "the level statistics of pseudointegrable systems has been found intermediate between those of integrable and chaotic systems @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we concentrate on their level dynamics , i.e.  on the distribution of the velocities and curvatures of the eigenvalues @xmath19 .",
    "it has been derived in @xcite that the distribution of the velocities @xmath20 of chaotic systems is gaussian , @xmath21 .",
    "the level curvature is defined as the second derivative of the eigenvalues @xmath22 .",
    "we scale it to the dimensionless curvature @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the average level spacing @xcite .",
    "the trajectories of particles without interaction are straight lines , i.e. , all @xmath25 , which corresponds to @xmath26 for integrable systems . in a chaotic billiard ,",
    "on the other hand , the interaction between the  eigenvalue particles  are long - ranged , leading to curved trajectories with a broad distribution @xmath1 .",
    "the curvatures @xmath2 for pure random gaussian orthogonal ensembles ( goe ) @xcite obey the generalized cauchy distribution @xcite @xmath27 eq.([scalcurvdistreq ] ) corresponds to a power - law behavior for large @xmath2 , @xmath3 , in agreement with earlier derivations @xcite .",
    "the small curvature behavior has been found to be non generic , when families of periodic orbits like bouncing balls are not taken explicitely into account @xcite ( see below ) .",
    "numerical works on pseudointegrable billiards , as the barrier billiard @xcite and systems approaching the chaotic sinai billiard by polygons with different genus numbers between @xmath28 and @xmath29 @xcite found that the trajectories of the eigenvalues do not cross each other ( as in integrable billiards ) , but show  avoided crossings  , indicating that some repulsive interaction must be present . in @xcite , a model of short - range interactions was used to calculate the spectral statistics of pseudointegrable systems . in @xcite ,",
    "the curvature distribution @xmath30 was calculated , which showed the expected goe behavior for large @xmath31 .",
    "supprisingly , a peak was found for @xmath32 close to zero that was larger in the case of the sinai billiard than for the polygon billiards .",
    "as also pointed out by the authors , this demands further investigation and we will show that it might be due to the fact that the bouncing ball orbits between parallel walls were not taken into account explicitely .",
