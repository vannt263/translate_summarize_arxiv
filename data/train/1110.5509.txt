    "in reliability , we are concerned primarily with test data in which lifetimes of items that fail during the course of the test are recorded or with variables related in some way to item lifetimes . if the actual lifetime of every item in the sample is recorded , the data are _ complete _ data . to obtain complete data ,",
    "it is necessary to continue the experiment until the last item on test or in service has failed . in cases where even a few items in the sample may have very long lifetimes",
    ", experiment can go on for a very long period of time and , in fact , well beyond the point at which the results may no longer be of any interest or use .",
    "in such situations , it may be desirable to terminate the study prior to failure of all items under test .",
    "when observation is discontinued prior to all items having failed , we obtain the so - called _ censored _ data .",
    "there are a variety of forms of censored data that arise in practice ; see , for example , balakrishnan and cohen ( 1991 ) and cohen ( 1991 ) .",
    "a form of censored data that is often encountered in applications is the so - called _ record _ data . as pointed out by gulati and padgett ( 1995 ) , often , in industrial testing , meteorological data , and some other situations , measurements may be made sequentially and only values smaller ( or larger ) than all previous ones",
    "are recorded .",
    "such data may be represented by @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the @xmath2-th record value meaning new minimum ( or maximum ) and @xmath3 is the number of trials following the observation of @xmath1 that are needed to obtain a new record value ( or to exhaust the available observation ) .",
    "there are two sampling schemes for generating such a record - breaking data :    * ( _ inverse sampling scheme _ ) items are presented sequentially and sampling is terminated when the @xmath4-th minimum is observed . in this case , the total number of items sampled is a random number , and @xmath5 is defined to be one for convenience ; * ( _ random sampling scheme _ ) a random sample @xmath6 is examined sequentially and successive minimum values are recorded . in this setting , we have @xmath7 , the number of records obtained , to be random and , given a value of @xmath4 , we have in this case @xmath8 .",
    "a random variable @xmath9 is said to have an exponential distribution , denoted by @xmath10 , if its cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) is @xmath11 and the probability density function ( pdf ) is @xmath12 the exponential distribution is commonly used in many applied problems .",
    "such a exponential distribution is a natural model while studying a variable that can take on only positive values such as lifetime of units . in some situations ,",
    "the weibull distribution is more suitable than the exponential distributions ( nelson , 1985 ) .",
    "the weibull cdf , denoted by @xmath13 , is @xmath14 and hence with pdf @xmath15 the scale parameter @xmath16 is called the characteristic life because it is always 63.2-th percentile .",
    "it determines the spread and has the same units as failure times , for example hours , months , cycles , and so forth .",
    "parameter @xmath17 is a unitless pure number and determines the shape of the distribution . for @xmath18 ,",
    "the weibull distribution is the exponential distribution .",
    "the weibull distribution appears very frequent in practical problems when we observe data representing minimal values .",
    "for example , the life of a capacitor is determined by shortest - lived portion of dielectric .",
    "for many parent populations with limited left tail , the limit of the minimum of independent samples converges to a weibull distribution ( lawless , 2003 ) .",
    "researchers often like to make parametric assumptions on the underlying distribution",
    ". with this in mind , estimation of the mean of an exponential distribution based on record data has been treated by samaniego and whitaker ( 1986 ) and doostparast ( 2009 ) .",
    "hoinkes and padgett ( 1994 ) obtained the ml estimators from record - breaking data in this model .",
    "as pointed out by lawless ( 2003 , chapter 10 , p. 465 ) , it is important to check the adequacy of models upon which inferences or actions are based . in the area of goodness of fit based on record data , there is a lack of published literature .",
    "but , there are a few works in this direction .",
    "however , informal methods of model checking emphasize graphical procedures such as probability and residual plots , smith ( 1988 ) proposed a form of residual for testing some parametric models .",
    "but in most cases , the variation inherent in graphical summaries is substantial , even when the data are generated by assumed model , and the eye can not always determine whether features in a plot are within the bounds of natural random variation .",
    "consequently , formal hypothesis tests are an important part of model checking .",
    "+ motivated by this , the aim of this paper is to provide some methods for model checking on the basis of records .",
    "specifically , suppose that the record data @xmath19 are coming from a population with parent cdf @xmath20 .",
    "we consider testing @xmath21 where @xmath17 and @xmath16 may be unknown positive constants .",
    "in other word , is the weibull model adequate to fit the data ?",
    "therefore , the rest of this article is organized as follows . since weibull model has a wide variety application , in section 2 , maximum likelihood estimate ( mle ) of the unknown parameters in weibull model",
    "are obtained . in section 3 , explicit expression for kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) and cramer - misses ( c - m ) goodness of fit tests is derived and we proposed a new modified goodness of fit test which is more suitable than the k - s and c - m statistics for records .",
    "critical values of these statistics are obtained by a simulation study . in section 4 , exponential model",
    "is considered and goodness of fit test for exponential model against the alternative weibull model is obtained .",
    "finally , some numerical examples are given to investigate results obtained .",
    "it can be shown that , the likelihood function for the two sampling schemes is given by @xmath22 let us assume that the sequence @xmath19 are coming from @xmath13-model .",
    "the corresponding likelihood function under either random or inversely sampling is obtained as @xmath23 after taking logarithm , we have @xmath24 through this paper `` log '' denotes natural logarithm .",
    "one can easily show that , the maximum of for @xmath25 , by taking derivatives , is obtained from solving the equations @xmath26 and @xmath27 where @xmath28 the equation can not be solved explicitly and hence the mles must be found by numerical methods .",
    "these equations is similar with equations ( 6.2 ) and ( 6.3 ) of lehmann and casella ( 1998 , ch .",
    "6 , p. 468 ) .",
    "hence , one can show that these equations have a unique solution .",
    "gof tests can be based on the approaches of comparison of parametric estimates with nonparametric counterparts .",
    "two well known examples are the kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) and the cramer - von mises ( c - m ) statistics defined by @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively , where @xmath31 is the hypothesized model while @xmath32 is the corresponding nonparametric maximum likelihood estimation ( npmle ) . on the basis of record data , arising from a random sample with size @xmath33 , samaniego and whitaker ( 1988 ) obtained npmle of survival function @xmath34 as @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the observed record values , ordered from smallest to largest and @xmath38 are the induced order statistics corresponding to the ordered record values @xmath39 or @xmath40 , @xmath41 . as mentioned by samaniego and whitaker ( 1988 ) , npmle in will perform poorly when estimating the right tail of the actual distribution , thus we suggest a new gof statistic as follows @xmath42 the basic idea for @xmath43 is similar with anderson - darling statistic and is to measure the distance between @xmath32 and @xmath31 in left tail region of @xmath44 better than c - m statistic in .",
    "one may notice that , on the basis of record data , the statistics @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath43 are modified so that the supreme and integral are over the range @xmath47 .",
    "sufficiently large values of @xmath45 , @xmath46 or @xmath43 provide evidence against the hypothesized model . to calculate the test statistics ,",
    "the following proposition is helpful .",
    "let @xmath48 be record data arising from a random sample with size @xmath33 .",
