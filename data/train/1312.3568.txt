    "a natural question about the hamiltonian used in the main text is whether errors might be induced by writing the quantum spin hall edge as spin - polarized along some direction , with right - moving electrons having spin up and left - moving electrons having spin down .",
    "it is often emphasized that the quantum spin hall edge survives even when no spin direction is conserved , and that the edge should be viewed as a `` kramers pair '' of states conjugate under the time - reversal operation .",
    "this supplement reviews what it means to say that the edge does not have a well - defined spin direction , and why in principle that could lead to a reduction in the tunneling amplitude @xmath105 , although the hamiltonian will still have the same form .    in practice ,",
    "the degree of spin polarization at the quantum spin hall edge is thought to be high , and @xmath105 is usually taken as a measured quantity rather than computed theoretically , but the considerations here may be useful for other problems .",
    "first , it is simple to show that the form of the hamiltonian remains correct even if the edge is not made up of spin eigenstates .",
    "consider the action of the tunneling hamiltonian that takes the low - lying right - moving state into some superposition in the two - level system made of the spin states of one electron on the dot : @xmath106 the action of the tunneling hamiltonian on the left - moving state is then obtained by acting with the time - reversal operation : @xmath107 where we have used the convention that the time - reversal operator is @xmath108 , with @xmath96 denoting complex conjugation",
    ". then an @xmath109 unitary transformation of spin basis on the dot @xmath110 gives the form assumed in the main text , with @xmath111 : @xmath112 the tunneling term thus remains the same .",
    "it is also easy to see that even though the interaction term on the dot @xmath113 is not invariant under the transformation  , the additional terms can be readily absorbed by a redefinition of @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , the full hamiltonian has exactly the same form if the helical edge is not fully spin - polarized , albeit with ( slightly ) renormalized coefficients . in particular",
    ", the coupling to the effective magnetic impurity in the kondo limit remains isotropic even in the presence of spin - orbit coupling .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached in  @xcite in a different language .",
    "this result seems perhaps counterintuitive if the edge is not fully spin - polarized : the dot with one electron is a two - level system and hence can be interpreted as a maximally polarized spin - half state along some direction . to give a physical picture of what is the `` rotated '' spin basis on the dot when the edge state is not a spin eigenstate to start with",
    ", it may be simplest to work with a simple example of a non - spin - polarized bloch state and think about a photoemission or tunneling experiment .",
    "consider for simplicity the following ( not yet normalized ) bloch state of crystal momentum zero , obtained by superposing a spin - up gaussian centered on locations @xmath114 , @xmath115 , with a spin - down gaussian cented on sites",
    "@xmath116 : @xmath117 as @xmath118 , this becomes the uniform state with @xmath119 and spin state @xmath120 + @xmath121 , i.e. , perfectly polarized along the @xmath122 spin direction .",
    "however , at finite @xmath123 the expansion of the above wavefunction over plane waves ( momentum eigenstates ) , as would be detected in an idealized photoemission experiment , becomes more interesting : the expansion of the above wavefunction in plane waves is @xmath124 where @xmath125 is a normalization constant .",
    "we see that the plane - wave expansion now includes all momenta differing from the crystal momentum ( zero ) by a reciprocal lattice vector , and that plane waves with odd @xmath126 are spin - polarized along @xmath127 .",
    "the absolute normalization can be set by letting @xmath128 at @xmath129 ( a single plane wave appears ) .",
    "then , @xmath130 will be consistently normalized for all @xmath123 if @xmath131 now the meaning of the statement that this state is not spin - polarized is evident : while @xmath132 is a pure quantum state , it involves multiple momenta , and consequently a measurement that only probes spin will give probabilities consistent with a mixed spin state rather than a pure spin state .",
    "( in modern parlance the state shows `` entanglement '' between the spin and momentum hilbert spaces . )",
    "the average spin along the @xmath133 direction is @xmath134 which drops from 1 at @xmath129 , to 0.17 at @xmath135 , to zero at @xmath136 .",
    "the average of a measurement in the other spin directions is always zero , proving that ( except at @xmath137 where only a single momentum state is involved ) the spin is not fully polarized if momentum is not resolved .",
    "the tunneling problem above can now be analyzed similarly and shows the same effect . to start with ,",
    "assume that the fundamental tunneling is spin - independent : then the magnitude of the effective tunneling strength @xmath105 to the dot can be reduced if the different momenta contained in the bloch state interfere destructively because they tunnel into the dot with opposite spin directions",
    ". if the tunneling has its own spin - orbit coupling , then the details of this interference will be modified depending on the specific momentum dependence of the spin direction induced in the tunneling . to summarize",
    ", the incomplete spin polarization in a bloch state can reduce the total tunneling matrix element @xmath105 , but the form of the hamiltonian in the main text remains valid , and the reduction of @xmath105 is only expected to be large if the spin polarization of the edge state is small , which is not believed to be the case for ( hg , cd)te ."

    "<S> the qshe edge  @xcite is a one - dimensional metal where spin plays a fundamental role : as a result of spin - orbit coupling , there is a single time - reversal - related `` kramers pair '' of low - energy propagating modes , which can be pictured as a right - moving mode of electrons with spin up along some axis and a left - moving mode with spin down . </S>",
    "<S> this edge is robust to disorder and interactions as long as the original symmetries of time - reversal and charge are unbroken  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> are much clearer than in transport : again a power - law is observed in the absorption spectrum , but now the power - law is determined by the interaction strength ( luttinger parameter ) along the edge because special properties of the qshe edge fix a scaling dimension in the field theory of this problem .    unlike an ordinary luttinger liquid  @xcite , the helical liquid plus kondo impurity can be mapped exactly onto the kondo problem in an ordinary fermi liquid , where the interactions in the qshe edge generate an effective anisotropic exchange coupling . </S>",
