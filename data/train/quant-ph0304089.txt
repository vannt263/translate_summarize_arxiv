    "it is a dream for both theorists and experimentalists to be able to control single quantum systems , in particular quantum gates for quantum computing .",
    "uchiyama described how to achieve open - loop control for spin - boson model in the first day of the symposium@xcite . among interesting works on open loop controls , viola and lloyd introduced quantum bang - bang control@xcite , whereas mancini _ et al .",
    "_ considered stochastic resonance to control quantum systems@xcite . however , as in classical control theories , open - loop control is of limited use because in most cases it is merely a blind control .",
    "feedback control is not only experimentally difficult , but even theoretically impossible , because a measurement at the output collapses the system s coherence@xcite .",
    "wiseman made many attempts to achieve feedback control , based mainly on the homodyne method of detection@xcite .",
    "_ used state estimation methods@xcite .",
    "these methods with some measurements at the output stage to have feedback signals can be summarized as shown in fig.([fig1]a ) .",
    "however , are such measurements necessary ? recent works on quantum information theories indicate that having signals need not destroy coherence .    in this paper the idea of feeding back precisely the process output is renounced . instead , a quantum cloning machine is placed at the output side , as shown in fig.([fig1]b ) . according to quantum - cloning theorems ,",
    "it is possible to make either imperfect copies with unity probability@xcite or perfect copies with probability less than unity@xcite . in the later case ,",
    "a measurement is necessary , whereas the former cloning machine , which can be decomposed into rotations and controlled nots gates , does not involve measurement@xcite .",
    "the former approach relies on adding some ancillary quantum system in a known state and unitarily evolving the resulting combined system",
    ". simply stated , a cloning machine is a device to split the information of the input state .",
    "when the buek and hillery cloning machine is applied at the process output , although the feedback and output of the controlled process become imperfect , as long as the system is controllable , so that the system can be steered to any state desired , and observable , so that the system can be monitored , it made no difference for controlling .",
    "we are no more than feeding back a transformed output . for the feedback loop",
    "the cloner acts like an actuator ( a device added to the feedback loop to alter the system s controllability and observability ) while for the output it distorted the output . although the controllability and the observability of the system are modified , the coherence of the output can be preserved .",
    "an analogy is that having a colleague who is invariably half - hour late for any meeting is immaterial .",
    "as long as she arrives , it makes no difference , for all practical purposes .",
    "= 7.5 cm 0.5 cm = 7.5 cm 0.3 cm",
    "the simplest actuator is a transformation that does nothing , which wiseman called simple feedback. in practice , one can adjust the actuator function to achieve system controllability and observability as in classical control theories , which is an engineering problem .    for a mixed input state ,",
    "the output state of the cloning machine reads , @xmath0 in which @xmath1 is the identity matrix .",
    "the bloch vector shrinks by a factor of @xmath2",
    ".    we can perform logical operations for the cloned feedback state , @xmath3 , with the input state , @xmath4 , to obtain the process input state , @xmath5 . in a control theory",
    ", we suppose a knowledge of only the desired state and our input signal ; intermediate states , such as the process input , are supposed to be unknown . a matching condition at the process output , or any other junction of the system , such as the process input , fixes the unknowns in @xmath6 . controllability and observability",
    "follow if this input - output mapping is one - to - one .    in conventional physics or engineering practice ,",
    "a dynamic process is represented by a differential equation such as a master equation . however , as an equation of this kind can be written in terms of quantum operations , we can ignore the detail and formulate the process in turns of quantum operations@xcite .    in the operator - sum formalism",
    ", a process defined by an input density matrix @xmath7 , and an output density matrix @xmath8 , with the process described by a quantum operation , @xmath9 , @xmath10 @xmath9 can be rewritten as a completely positive linear transformation acting on the density matrix @xmath11 in which the @xmath12 satisfy the completeness relation @xmath13 or equivalently @xmath14=1 $ ] .",
    "this way of treating the process is elegant .",
    "furthermore , we can treat the cloning machine consistently .",
    "as an example , we consider the process of a two - level atom coupled to the vacuum undergoing spontaneous emission .",
    "the coherent part of the atom s evolution has a hamiltonian @xmath15 , in which @xmath16 is the energy difference of the atomic level .",
    "the emission process is described by an lindblad operator @xmath17 , in which @xmath18 is the atomic lowering operator , and @xmath19 is the rate of spontaneous emission .",
    "the master equation reads , @xmath20+\\gamma^{'}\\left [ 2 \\sigma_- \\rho^ { ' } \\sigma_+ - \\sigma_+ \\sigma_- \\rho^ { ' } -   \\rho^ { ' } \\sigma_+ \\sigma_- \\right ] , \\ ] ] with @xmath21 .",
    "the solution of this equation in the interaction picture can be written in the operator - sum formalism , after a change of variable @xmath22 and using a bloch vector representation for @xmath23 , as @xmath24 in which @xmath25 while @xmath26 implies the probability of losing a photon .",
    "for the suffixes of @xmath23 , please refer to fig.([fig1]b ) .",
    "the most general input state for the process can be written in terms of bloch sphere representation as @xmath27 here , @xmath28 is the bloch vector of length unity or less , and @xmath29 is the vector of pauli matrices .",
    "these intermediate variables are to be eliminated from the following calculations .",
    "the action of the process on this density matrix produces @xmath30 in which @xmath31 is computed according to eq.([anklesofhair ] ) .",
    "this state can be fed into the cloner according to eq.([mcloner ] ) .",
    "the later state is also the output state of the system , since the cloning machine we used is symmetric .    for simplicity and demonstration",
    ", we consider a system without even the input terminal , in the first instance .",
    "therefore , bloch vector @xmath32 becomes the input bloch vector of the process .",
    "hence , @xmath33 fixes the unknown variables of the system .",
    "the solution is @xmath34 .",
    "if one want to have an input signal to control the system , at least a two - qubit gate is needed for the gate , @xmath35 , to combine the feedback signal and the input signal .",
    "it can be a controlled - not gate or a controlled - phase gate for example .",
    "even more generally , a controlled - u gate@xcite can serve . furthermore , according to the landauer s principle , if one wishes the system to be reversible , the gate must has input terminals and output terminals of equal number , as shown in the figure , although the extra output signal can be discarded .",
    "suppose we take the input signal , @xmath4 , having a bloch vector @xmath36 , and the feedback signal , @xmath3 , as the control signal .",
    "the controlled - not gate read , @xmath37 the total density matrix of the input and the feedback state is a direct product of the input density matrix , @xmath38 , and the feedback density matrix , @xmath39 .",
    "after they interact through @xmath40 , partial trace is taken over the @xmath4 degree of freedom .",
    "the resulting density matrix reads @xmath41 only one component of the input bloch vector has an influence on the process , because the @xmath40 gate mixed the total density matrix only slightly whereas the partial trace operation eliminated all other components .    matching eq.([bloch ] ) and eq.([match ] )",
    "yields @xmath42 , and @xmath43 , which fixes the unknown variables of the process .",
    "a valid bloch vector has to be of length unity or less .",
    "furthermore , note @xmath44 is also less than unity . through eq.([ab ] ) , one obtains the input - output relationship of the system : @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .",
    "the system is controllable in the valid range of the process because the mapping between @xmath47 and @xmath48 is one to one .",
    "furthermore , according to eq.([ab ] ) the system is observable , because we can calculate the process state once we know the output state .",
    "similar calculation can be done if one take @xmath4 as the control signal .    in summary ,",
    "the system considered maps states with bloch vector @xmath49 into states with bloch vector @xmath50 .",
    "if the mapping from @xmath49 to @xmath51 is one to one , by definition , the system is controllable@xcite .",
    "the mapping of state with bloch vector @xmath32 to state with bloch vector @xmath52 is one to one signifies the system is observable .",
    "coherent feedback is formulated without using adiabatic elimination as wiseman did .",
    "our method indicated that , although the system can not be divided , the information can .",
    "therefore part of the output information is feed back for control purposes .",
    "this work is a synergy of two fields in modern science , namely , automatic control theories and quantum - cloning theories . as bru",
    "_ et al . _",
    "mentioned , presently quantum - cloning theories have been mainly of academic interests@xcite .",
    "a concrete example of the application of cloning theory is presented here .    in the example",
    "given , one has the freedom to either feedback the ancilla or one of the cloned copy , since the ancilla also contains the process information@xcite . according to the figure ,",
    "their roles are similar .",
    "the input control signal need not be another unknown quantum state@xcite .",
    "it can be a quantum system in its eigenstate .",
    "we can change other parameters , such as time , for controlling .",
    "the details depend on the design of the system . on the other hand ,",
    "an unknown state controlling another unknown state is not necessarily useless : a not - gate is an example@xcite . in the same way we can design gates that switch the quantum state to a particular state . for instance , a gate that always rotates the input state by 45 degree .",
    "a control system which incorporated 45 , 90 , 135 degrees of rotation , with selection is another way to achieve quantum control .    with a quantum feedback system formulated in this way ,",
    "many recent results in quantum information sciences are applicable .",
    "for instance , the system can be considered as a channel ; it entropy exchange can be calculated and the uncertainty principle derived@xcite .",
    "our formalism does suffer from some deficiencies : firstly , the outputs of the cloner are likely to entangled with themselves or with the ancilla@xcite .",
    "we assume this does not happen presently . secondly , because the operator - sum formalism ignores the detail evolution of the system , we can take no time lag between various components into account .",
    "the evolution time of any component must be finite@xcite .",
    "the entanglement can not be eliminated in view of the second point because entanglement serves to accelerate the evolution .",
    "however , the time lag problem only makes difference at the design stage .",
    "the basic method for doing quantum feedback control is unchanged .    for the control scheme proposed by lloyd@xcite",
    ", he found quantum control with coherent feedback often do not distinguish between sensors and actuators .",
    "this is probably because of the models he considered are pathological . in conventional control theories , there is always an input control signal to be mixed with the feedback signal .",
    "therefore the roles of the process and the actuator are made asymmetric .",
    "however , in lloyd s examples this input signal is missing .",
    "recently simon _ et al . _",
    "proposed doing quantum cloning via stimulated emission@xcite . in view of our proposal , this recently realized cloning machine appears to be part of warszawski and wiseman s feedback control system@xcite in that they all have feedback in one mode which coupled to another mode for output .",
    "perhaps their device has a cloner implicitly built - in ?"
