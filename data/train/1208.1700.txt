    "secondly , remove any circles of intersection which are trivial in some ( hence any ) annulus by incompressibility and irreducibility .",
    "now consider any remaining circles of intersection between the @xmath220 and @xmath224 in @xmath224 .",
    "these are parallel , essential curves on @xmath224 .",
    "hence in the lift @xmath225 , the lifts of these intersections all approach @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "this means that the lift @xmath225 only intersects the @xmath221 which approach @xmath63 and @xmath64 . as these",

    "\\(3 ) lastly we consider the case when the images of the @xmath196 are @xmath198 distinct curves , where @xmath228 and @xmath229 .",
    "our first task is to show that in this case @xmath162 , as defined above , is embedded .",
    "as before , each @xmath196 is invariant under @xmath156 , where @xmath157 is hyperbolic and fixes @xmath63 and @xmath64 on @xmath69 .",
    "denote the geodesic in @xmath164 invariant under @xmath157 by @xmath163 .",
    "then , as there are @xmath230 curves in @xmath196 which are identified in the quotient , @xmath163 is invariant under @xmath185 where @xmath231 .",
    "now let @xmath232 be the @xmath185-orbit of @xmath233 , cyclically ordered around @xmath63 and @xmath64 as above .",
    "let @xmath234 and let @xmath201 be a regular neighborhood of this image .",
    "then label the two boundary components of @xmath201 by @xmath204 and @xmath207 so that the induced labeling of the boundary components of the lifts has @xmath235 next to @xmath236 @xmath237 in the cyclic ordering around @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "then there is a @xmath157-invariant strip connecting @xmath238 and @xmath163 and another connecting @xmath163 with @xmath239 .",
    "the union of these two invariant strips maps down to an immersed essential annulus in @xmath5 and by the annulus theorem , there is an embedded essential annulus @xmath240 with the same boundary .",
    "the lifts of @xmath240 do not intersect and hence the lifts meeting @xmath63 and @xmath64 consist of @xmath241 strips connecting each @xmath235 to @xmath236 .",
    "the action of @xmath185 permutes these @xmath241 strips cyclically and takes @xmath163 to itself .",
    "therefore , @xmath163 is on the inside of these strips .",
    "that is , there is a region @xmath192 bounded by preimages of @xmath240 which meets the @xmath242 and @xmath192 contains @xmath163 .",
    "thus @xmath163 intersects its images under @xmath1 in either itself or the empty set , which implies @xmath243 is embedded .",
    "now consider the whole set of @xmath196 .",
    "order them cyclically around @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "each @xmath196 is connected to @xmath163 by a @xmath157-invariant strip .",
    "since @xmath162 is embedded , it has a regular neighborhood @xmath244 which is a solid torus .",
    "the image of such a @xmath157-invariant strip in @xmath5 will restrict to an essential proper immersed annulus in @xmath245 . by the annulus theorem",
    ", there is an embedded annulus @xmath246 in @xmath245 with the same boundary .",
    "we form such an annulus for each @xmath212 .",
    "note that each boundary on @xmath247 is a curve of the same slope .",
    "therefore , we can arrange so that the boundaries of the @xmath248 are disjoint , and cyclically ordered in the same order as the @xmath196 . then since the boundary of the annuli are not linked , by choosing a collection that intersect minimally , the @xmath248 will be disjoint .",
    "now take a regular neighborhood of @xmath249 .",
    "this will be a solid torus @xmath250 which meets the boundary of @xmath5 in @xmath134 parallel annuli @xmath213 , where @xmath213 is a regular neighborhood of @xmath212 .",
    "the component of the characteristic submanifold will be @xmath251 .",
    "this has a pre - image @xmath192 in @xmath191 which meets the @xmath252 and which is naturally foliated by @xmath157-invariant lines .",
    "the images of these lines in @xmath250 are a seifert - fibering of the solid torus @xmath250 .",
    "the components of @xmath253 are annuli on @xmath254 .",
    "the pre - images in @xmath192 , as before , connect neighboring boundary components of the @xmath252 .",
    "now let @xmath255 be an essential annulus or mbius strip in @xmath5 .",
    "we will show that @xmath255 is properly homotopic into the submanifold constructed above .",
    "pick a basepoint on @xmath255 and let @xmath157 generate the fundamental group of @xmath255 in @xmath1 .",
    "since @xmath255 is essential , a lift @xmath256 of @xmath255 must meet two different components , @xmath10 and @xmath153 , of @xmath3 , both of which are @xmath157-invariant and which meet the fixed points @xmath63 and @xmath64 of @xmath157 on @xmath69 .",
    "thus @xmath10 and @xmath153 bump at @xmath63 and @xmath64 . from our construction",
    ", there is a @xmath157-invariant strip @xmath257 contained in some component @xmath109 which meets @xmath10 and @xmath153 in the convex hull of @xmath63 and @xmath64 in each component .",
    "consider the solid torus @xmath258 .",
    "this is a solid torus and the images of @xmath259 and @xmath257 are two embedded essential annuli with the same slope .",
    "they are therefore parallel by a proper isotopy . this isotopy maps down to a proper homotopy of @xmath255 into a component @xmath109 of the submanifold we have constructed .",
