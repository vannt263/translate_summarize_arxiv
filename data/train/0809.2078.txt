    "atomic clouds in rotating optical lattices have garnered a large amount of interest from researchers in the fields of condensed matter physics , atomic physics , and quantum optics .",
    "an optical lattice simulates the periodic potential ubiquitous in solid state physics , while rotation probes the superfluid character of these cold atomic gases by driving the formation of quantized vortices . here",
    "we explore the theory of vortices in an optical lattice .",
    "specifically , we investigate the evolution of the vortex configurations that occur in the single - band tight - binding limit as the rotation rate is slowly varied .",
    "the energy landscape has a complicated topography that leads to hysteresis .",
    "the vortex configurations depend on commensurability of several different length scales .",
    "a uniform gas of atoms of mass @xmath0 in an optical lattice rotating with frequency @xmath1 is characterized by several important scales . among these",
    "are the on - site interaction @xmath2 , the lattice spacing @xmath3 , the magnetic length @xmath4 , and the particle density @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is planck s constant .",
    "the behavior of the system changes when these various scales form different commensurate ratios .",
    "there are three well known examples of such commensurability effects , namely when @xmath7 is rational for a two dimensional noninteracting gas , when @xmath8 is an integer of a non - rotating gas in dimension @xmath9 , or when @xmath10 is rational for a two - dimensional lattice - free gas .",
    "the first example gives the hofstadter butterfly single - particle spectrum @xcite , the second the superfluid - mott transition , and the third the fractional quantum hall effect .",
    "here we explore how the commensurability between @xmath11 and @xmath3 plays out in an interacting superfluid , away from the mott  @xcite and fractional quantum hall limits @xcite .",
    "we study the vortex configurations that emerge in a harmonically trapped atomic cloud inside a rotating optical lattice in the single - band tight - binding limit .",
    "the resulting phenomenology is rich , as the vortex configurations depend on a number of factors , including : the vortex - vortex interaction , the vortex - pinning potential due to the optical lattice , the finite cloud size , and the past history of the cloud .",
    "fast enough rotation of a uniform superfluid results in the formation of an array of quantized vortex lines of cross - sectional density @xmath12 , corresponding to a mean intervortex spacing of @xmath13 . in an infinite system , these vortices arrange themselves in a triangular lattice configuration , but a finite cloud size produces distortions @xcite .",
    "a co - rotating optical lattice introduces a vortex - pinning potential with minima at the optical lattice potential maxima ( between the occupied sites ) . for commensurate vortex densities ,",
    "this pinning can cause the lowest energy configuration to switch from a triangular vortex lattice , to one that shares the geometry of the optical lattice @xcite . in practice",
    "the vortices are insufficiently mobile to find the true ground state , and one typically sees some metastable configuration , for example with a number of domains separated by defects .",
    "we present a realistic simulation of these effects .",
    "we perform calculations in two - dimensions , modeling a harmonically trapped gas of bosons in a rotating square lattice .",
    "the two - dimensional case is convenient because we can then concentrate on the interaction between vortex cores in a single plane .",
    "this is also an experimentally relevant geometry , as the dimensionality of the system can be controlled by using an anisotropic harmonic potential , or optical lattice , where the hard trapping direction is along the rotation axis of the optical lattice  @xcite . a recent experiment  @xcite realized exactly this scenario by placing a rotating mask in the fourier plane of a laser beam which forms an optical dipole trap .",
    "the mask contained three / four holes , producing a triangular / square lattice in the image plane , where the atoms were trapped .",
    "the lattice spacing was large due to the nature of their optics but can in principle be made small enough to explore the single - band tight - binding limit that we investigate .",
    "a similar setup , using a dual - axis acousto - optic deflector , promises to reach this limit in the near future @xcite .",
    "we find hysteresis in our numerical algorithm , reflecting the complicated energy landscape for the vortex configurations , and discuss how similar hysteresis will appear in experiments .",
    "this landscape reflects the competition between vortex - vortex interactions and pinning to the optical lattice . in section",
    "ii we describe our mean - field ansatz and numerical self - consistency routine . in section iii",
    "we show how vortex configurations evolve from commensurate lattices to incommensurate ring - like structures as the rotation rate is varied . in section",
    "iv we present the hysteretic evolution of vortex configurations on spin - up and then spin - down . in section",
    "v we simulate the results of time - of - flight imaging of these systems , and in section vi we summarize our results .    previous work , focusing on the multi - band weak lattice limit , found vortex structures similar to those we see in our tight binding model @xcite , but did not report on how these structures evolved as parameters were adiabatically varied .",
    "our discussion of the expansion of the rotating cloud initially in the single - band tight - binding regime is also novel .",
    "in the reference frame of the rotating optical lattice , our system is described by the rotating bose - hubbard hamiltonian  @xcite : @xmath14 where @xmath15 $ ] is the hopping matrix element from site @xmath16 to site @xmath17 .",
    "the rotation vector potential , which gives rise to the coriolis effect , is @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the number of circulation quanta per optical - lattice site .",
    "the local chemical potential @xmath20 includes the centripetal potential . in these expressions",
    ", @xmath21 is the central chemical potential , @xmath22 is the trapping frequency , @xmath1 is the rotation speed , @xmath23 is the position of site @xmath17 , @xmath0 is the atomic mass , @xmath24 @xmath25 is a bosonic creation ( annihilation ) operator , @xmath26 is the particle number operator for site @xmath17 , and @xmath2 is the particle - particle interaction strength .",
    "the connection between these parameters and the laser intensities are given by jaksch et al .",
    "@xcite . here , and in the rest of the paper , we use units where the lattice spacing is unity , and we operate exclusively at zero temperature .    both the superfluid and mott insulator are well described by a spatially inhomogeneous gutzwiller product _ ansatz _",
    "@xcite , @xmath27 where @xmath17 is the site index , @xmath28 is the total number of sites , @xmath29 is the n - particle occupation - number state at site @xmath17 , and @xmath30 is the corresponding complex amplitude , with @xmath31 .",
    "this ansatz is more general than the more standard mean - field approximation described by the lattice gross - pitaevskii equation . in the limit where the latter works well ,",
    "the two theories agree .",
    "the gutzwiller ansatz has been used extensively to understand experimental results  @xcite , and is well suited for studying the vortex physics that we consider here .    using equation   as a variational _ ansatz _ , we minimize the energy with respect to the @xmath32 .",
    "we then extract the density @xmath33 and the condensate order parameter @xmath34 at each site .",
    "the condensate density @xmath35 is equal to the superfluid density in this model , and is generally not equal to the density .",
    "we use an iterative algorithm to determine the @xmath36 which ( locally ) minimize the energy .",
    "we use a square region with @xmath37 sites per side with hard boundary conditions .",
    "we find that we must take @xmath37 much larger than the effective trap radius so that our solutions do not depend on those boundaries .",
    "typically we use @xmath38 .",
    "we calculate @xmath39 using equation .",
    "minimizing @xmath39 with respect to @xmath40 with the constraint @xmath41 gives @xmath42 nonlinear eigenvalue equations , one for each site ,    @xmath43    where the sum is over all nearest neighbors of site @xmath16 , @xmath0 is the particle - number index , @xmath44 is a lagrange multiplier , and @xmath45@xmath46}$ ] , with @xmath17@xmath47@xmath48 .",
    "we iteratively solve these equations : first choosing a trial order - parameter field @xmath49 , where @xmath50 ; then updating it by @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the iteration index .",
    "similar calculations were performed by scarola and das sarma  @xcite to analyze the case where the single - particle mott state is surrounded by a rotating superfluid ring . in the uniform case",
    "this algorithm has been used by wu et .",
    "@xcite as well as goldbaum and mueller  @xcite and oktel et .",
    "al .  @xcite .",
    "since equation ( [ m ] ) is highly nonlinear , we find that the solution that this iterative algorithm converges to is sensitive to the initial state we use .",
    "this feature allows us to see the hysteretic effects described in the text .",
    "experiments will see similar hysteresis , but the precise details will differ from our calculations ( for example the critical frequencies for vortex entry and egress will be somewhat modified ) .",
    "we systematically explore the phase space , varying the parameters in the hamiltonian .",
    "we simulate clouds with diameter from 30 - 60 sites , comparable to the sizes studied in experiments  @xcite . for the largest simulations we impose four - fold rotational symmetry , but introduce no constraints in the smaller simulations .",
    "( a ) energy vs rotation rate .",
    "sharp drops indicate vortex formation . energy scaled by on - site interaction parameter @xmath2 , and rotation rate quoted as @xmath19 , the number of circulation quanta per optical - lattice site .",
    "( b ) , ( d ) , ( f ) superfluid density profile at parameters labeled in ( a ) . light - to - dark shading corresponds to low - to - high density , and position is measured in lattice spacing .",

    "solid white circle denotes edge of cloud .",
    "dashed lines are guides to the eye .",
    "black circles denote vortex locations . in ( b ) , ( c ) and ( f ) , ( g ) rotation speed should favor a commensurate square vortex lattice rotated by @xmath53 from the optical lattice axes .",
    "( d ) , ( e ) represents an incommensurate rotation speed . ]    we find a great variety of vortex patterns , including those resembling square vortex lattices .",
    "these are most stable at the rotation rates where they are commensurate with the underlying optical lattice .",
    "commensurate bravais lattices exist when @xmath54 is an integer , and commensurate square lattices when @xmath55 , for integral @xmath5 and @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "which vortex patterns appear in a simulation , or in an experiment  @xcite , depends on how the system is prepared .",
    "this hysteresis occurs because the energy landscape has many deep gorges with near - degenerate energies , separated by high barriers .    to illustrate this energy landscape , we fix @xmath56 and @xmath57 , and study how the energy evolves as we vary the rotation speed . first , starting with the non - rotating ground state , we sequentially increase the rotation speed , using the previous wavefunction as a seed for our iterative algorithm .",
    "we adjust @xmath22 as we increase @xmath1 so that the cloud size , related to the thomas - fermi radius , @xmath58 , remains effectively fixed .",
    "the energy as a function of rotation speed , shown in figure  [ v - lattice_figure_prep](a ) , has a series of sharp drops , corresponding to the entry of one or more vortices from outside of the cloud . at",
    "these rotation speeds the system jumps from one local minimum of the energy landscape to another .",
    "figure [ v - lattice_figure_prep ] ( b)-(g ) shows the superfluid density and phases associated with the vortex patterns found during this _ adiabatic _ increase in rotation speed , where we impose four - fold rotation symmetry about the trap center .",
    "subfigures ( b ) and ( c ) show a regular square vortex lattice seen near the commensurate @xmath59 .",
    "subfigures ( d ) and ( e ) show the vortex configuration at @xmath60 which is intermediate between the commensurate values @xmath61 and @xmath62 . rather than forming a square pattern , the vortex configuration appears to be made of concentric rings .",
    "such ring - like structures also occur for superfluids rotating in hard - walled cylindrical containers @xcite , where boundaries play an important role . despite this analogy",
    ", it appears that in the harmonic trap these circular configurations are _ not _ a consequence of the circular boundary .",
    "when we simulate an elliptical trap , we still find roughly circular vortex configurations .",
    "as one increases @xmath19 towards @xmath63 , a domain containing a square vortex lattice begins to grow in the center of the trap . as seen in subfigures ( f ) and",
    "( g ) , at commensurability the domain only occupies part of the cloud , even though one would expect that a uniform square lattice would be energetically favorable .",
    "the inability of the system to find the expected lowest energy configuration during an adiabatic spin - up is indicative of the complicated energy landscape .",
    "the patterns that we find are largely determined by the symmetry of the instabilities by which vortices enter the system .",
    "for example , even when we do not impose a four - fold symmetry constraint this adiabatic spin - up approach never produces square vortex lattices oriented at an angle other than @xmath53 with respect to the optical lattice axes . on the other hand",
    ", we readily produce other commensurate vortex lattices by choosing the appropriate rotation speed and seeding our iterative algorithm with the corresponding phase pattern .",
    "we have verified this approach with square vortex lattices oriented at various angles with respect to the optical lattice , taking @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "energy steps in the blue ( red ) curve correspond to nucleation ( expulsion ) of vortices .",
    "( b)-(e ) order parameter complex phase for parameters labeled in ( a ) .",
    "black circles are drawn around vortex cores , and white circles indicate the approximate extent of the gas . ]",
    "we further explore the history dependance of the vortex configurations by increasing , then decreasing @xmath1 .",
    "we do not impose a four - fold symmetry constraint , but take a smaller system with @xmath67 . at any given @xmath1 , the energy shown in figure  [ hysteresis ] ( a ) depends on the system s history .",
    "the increasing(blue)/decreasing(red ) rotation curve has sharp energy drops signaling the introduction / ejection of vortices to / from the system .",
    "the energy drops occur at different @xmath1 for spin - up and spin - down , indicating that the critical rotation speed for a vortex to enter or exit the system is different .",
    "generically , there are more vortices in the system on spin - down than on spin - up . depending on @xmath1",
    ", one may find a lower energy state by increasing ( subfigs .",
    "( b ) and ( c ) ) or by decreasing ( subfigs .",
    "( d ) and ( e ) ) the rotation rate . as demonstrated by subfigs .",
    "( d ) and ( e ) , vortex configurations produced during spin - up typically have the four - fold rotational symmetry of the optical lattice , while the vortex configurations calculated during spin - down are more likely to break this symmetry .",
    "an experiment will display the same qualitative features , but slightly different vortex configurations .    when @xmath1 is changed more rapidly ( _ i.e. _ , the step - size is increased ) , we find more symmetry broken states than when we use small steps .",
    "the energy differences between the symmetric and asymmetric states are extremely small , so the energies shown in figure  [ hysteresis ] are robust over a large range of sweep rates .",
    "in a previous paper  @xcite we proposed detecting vortices in optical lattice systems through time - of - flight imaging  @xcite , where at time @xmath68 one turns off the lattice and the harmonic trap , letting the cloud expand .",
    "after some fixed time @xmath69 one then produces an absorption image of the cloud using a resonant laser beam . in a weakly - interacting gas , the density profile is related to the momentum distribution of the gas . here",
    "we elaborate on this argument , and show how the vortices will be observable in the time - of - flight ( tof ) images .",
    "this complements other methods for extracting vortex properties , such as bragg spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "recently palmer , klein , and jaksch investigated time - of - flight expansion in the fractional quantum hall limit @xcite .",
    "we present a simple model where we neglect interactions during the time - of - flight .",
    "this approximation is quite good .",
    "first , the interactions between atoms from different sites can generically be neglected : by the time atoms from different sites overlap , the density is so low that they have negligable chance of scattering .",
    "second , in the single - band tight - binding limit the kinetic energy from the zero - point motion of atoms on a single site should exceed the interaction energy , meaning that the trajectory of the atoms will only be slightly perturbed by the interactions .",
    "if one did include the effects of interactions during the expansion one would see a slight blurring of the interference patterns .",
    "this blurring comes from two effects : ( 1 ) atoms from sites with higher occupation will be moving faster ( the interaction energy is converted into kinetic energy ) , and ( 2 ) the interactions introduce phase shifts which depend on atom number",
    ".    within our approximation , calculating the density of the expanding cloud reduces to a series of single - particle problems . taking the initial wavefunction to be given by equation ,",

    "this is equivalent to evolving the single - particle state annihilated by @xmath74 via the free schrodinger equation .    for this analysis we use the notation that @xmath75 is a vector in the @xmath76 plane , and @xmath77 represents the coordinate in the perpendicular direction .",

    "the incoherent contribution @xmath98 has no additional structure .",
    "this is a consequence of the gutzwiller approximation , which neglects short - range correlations . adding these correlations would modify the shape of the background , but it will remain smooth .",
    "the interference term has the structure of the envelope @xmath97 multiplied by the modulus squared of the discrete fourier transform of the superfluid order parameter .",
    "the discrete fourier transform can be constructed by taking the continuous fourier transform of the product of a square array of delta - functions , and a smooth function which interpolates the superfluid order parameter .",
    "the resulting convolution produces of a series of bragg peaks , each of which have an identical internal structure which is the fourier transform of the interpolated superfluid order parameter .",
    "the vortices will be visible in the structure of these peaks .",
    "vortices in real - space lead to vortices in reciprocal space .",
    "this result is clearest for  lowest landau level \" vortex lattices  @xcite which are expressible as an analytic function of @xmath99 multiplied by a gaussian of the form @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is a length scale which sets the cloud size . aside from a scale factor and a rotation , the continuous fourier transform of such a function",
