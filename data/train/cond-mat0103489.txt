    "moreover , we discuss the resulting angular momentum carried by the condensate , which increases quasicontinuously for rotations beyond that required for stabilization of a few vortices .    one striking new feature of a small condensate in a rotating anisotropic trap is the possibility of increasing the angular momentum by elongating ( which increases the moment of inertia ) and simultaneously decreasing the number of vortices ( because fewer cores can fit in the stretched form ) . in this way",

    "( [ gndst ] ) tends to zero . below the threshold interaction strength for vortex stabilization",
    ", the density contours always represent elongated no - vortex states ; their width is smaller for smaller interactions strengths and increases slowly with increased rotation .",
    "this elongation seems to hinder vortex formation .    in order to study the detailed structure of the phases in the asymmetric cases",
    ", we considered again the intermediate interaction strength @xmath220 and determined the occupancies @xmath201 for small ( @xmath221 ) and moderate ( @xmath222 ) asymmetry , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : occu1014 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : occu11 ] respectively .",
    "as the applied rotation increases , the smaller asymmetry shows phases with increasing number of vortices , just as in the case of a symmetric trap ( compare fig .",
    "[ fig : occusymm ] for a symmetric trap ) .",
    "in contrast to the re - entrant behavior for @xmath223 ( fig .  [",
    "fig : dens1014 ] ) , we conclude that these relatively strong interactions @xmath200 eliminate the effect of the ( small ) asymmetry , in part because the transitions occur at slower angular velocity . for the moderate asymmetry ( @xmath74 ) , however , the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : occu11 ] still exhibits re - entrant behavior ; thus a @xmath125-asymmetry dominates the behavior for this interaction strength ( @xmath200 ) and precludes more than two vortex cores . note that the one - vortex phase continues for @xmath224 as if it had not been interrupted by the two - vortex phase .",
    "typical density contours for the two asymmetries are included in fig .",
    "[ fig : densasym ] .",
    "several features differ significantly from the symmetric geometry .",
    "the no - vortex phase has a considerable @xmath218 admixture , producing a constriction along the @xmath65 axis . in the one - vortex phase",
    ", the condensate has a central vortex , but the elliptical trap and rotation - induced elongation deform the condensate noticeably . for @xmath225 , the contributions from @xmath226 ( and other odd states ) grow as @xmath1 approaches the transition to two vortices , deforming the surface region because of four vortex cores that move in from infinity .",
    "the density contours for the interacting two - vortex state show the admixture of the noninteracting ground state because the vortex cores are pushed further from the center of the trap than in the symmetric case .",
    "the small admixtures of other basis states with an even number of vortex cores favors the accumulation of density closer to the center ( outside the core regions ) .    for the smaller asymmetry , the subsequent figures display three and four separate cores , respectively .",
    "in the three - vortex phase , however , the cores are not symmetrically distributed around the center ( the appreciable occupation of @xmath218 enhances the two vortices along the @xmath62 axis , placing the third core on the horizontal axis and further away from the trap center ) . from fig .",
    "[ fig : occu1014 ] , note that the mixture of noninteracting states differs from the symmetric case ( fig .",
    "[ fig : occusymm ] ) , where the states contained only noninteracting states with the same rotational symmetry .",
    "the last two density contours in the right column illustrate that the re - entrant phases can indeed be classified as states with one or zero vortices .",
    "for such fast rotations , the condensate is very elongated and very flat ( as can be seen from the fewer density contours ) .",
    "it is energetically favorable to reduce the number of vortices ( which need a wider condensate ) and to compensate the loss of vorticity in the vortex cores by expanding the condensate along the horizontal axis . in the re - entrant @xmath150-phase",
    ", we have several small contributions from basis states with an even number of cores .",
    "this causes small ripples on a thin extended gaussian density .",
    "basis states with an odd number of cores would put a density minimum at the center of the trap , but the dominant @xmath150 suppresses this tendency .    in recent experiments",
    "@xcite , the paris group measured the nucleation of vortices in their large , cigar - shaped condensate and the corresponding angular momentum resulting from the vortices _",
    "when ramping up the rotation , they eventually find vortex - free states again , which is a re - entrant phenomenon similar to what we find in our analysis for much smaller condensates .",
    "moreover , they also measure the nucleation of vortices when sweeping the asymmetry @xmath227 and keeping the rotation fixed , leading again to a window of vortex stabilization .",
    "for the small condensate , we also determined the transition to a one - vortex state in the @xmath2-@xmath228 plane , as illustrated for several @xmath0 and asymmetries up to @xmath229 (  fig .",
    "[ fig : fasym ] ) . for asymmetries larger than the rightmost end of the graphs",
    ", there is no vortex state for rotations up to @xmath230 . in agreement with the @xmath2-@xmath0 phase diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phdasym ] ) , we here see the re - entrance in that @xmath2-@xmath228 phase diagram , leading to a qualitatively similar restricted rotation window for stabilizing a vortex .      having discussed the typical phases , we can now consider the details of the transitions themselves .",
    "the occupations of the separate constituent noninteracting states ( compare fig .  [ fig : occu1014 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : occu11 ] ) have an important new feature .",
    "there is a smooth transition between the no - vortex and the one - vortex state for @xmath200 for both asymmetric geometries , reminiscent of a second - order transition .",
    "this phenomenon can already be found for a very small asymmetry , as illustrated for @xmath231 in fig .",
    "[ fig : occusmall ] .",
    "the critical frequency @xmath232 is a few per cent larger than @xmath233 for the symmetric trap .",
    "nevertheless , the density contours close to the transition reveal that a vortex core gradually enters the condensate along the @xmath65 axis ( as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : denssmall ] ) .",
    "this behavior is qualitatively distinct from that for the symmetric case ( for the first transition at @xmath200 , we examined points as close as rotation speeds @xmath234 ) .",
    "thus we infer that the character of the transition in asymmetric traps differs fundamentally from the symmetric case , for we now have a cross - over region where both @xmath235 and @xmath236 are nonzero . in this situation ,",
    "the meaning of the critical transition frequency @xmath237 becomes somewhat blurred .",
    "for both asymmetric geometries ( @xmath151 and @xmath152 ) , this cross - over region shrinks for smaller interactions .",
    "in fact , we find a sharp transition below @xmath238 for the smaller asymmetry and below @xmath239 for the moderate asymmetry . for all other subsequent equilibrium phases , we found spontaneous jumps in the occupancies , similar to first - order transitions .",
    "the change in character can be understood as follows : for parameters that lead to a sharp transition , the energy functional has two competing , well - separated main minima , one lying in the @xmath235-dominated sector and the other in the @xmath236-dominated sector . indeed , depending on whether we choose @xmath235 or @xmath236 to implement the norm condition in our minimization procedure , we find one or the other minimum in the neighborhood of the transition .",
    "the comparison of the energies then gives the true global minimum .",
    "the depth of these two minima gradually changes with @xmath2 ; at the transition , the minimum representing the one - vortex state becomes deeper .",
    "this picture allows for hysteresis in stabilizing a single vortex with increasing rotation .",
    "in fact , hysteresis is the favored explanation for the deviation of the measured @xmath237 from the thomas - fermi predictions ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "moreover , the fact that the phase after re - entrance appear to be the continuation of the phase _ before _ the previous transition means that the corresponding minimum still exists and again lies below the energy of the intervening higher - vortex state . for a continuous transition , in contrast , the minimum energy functional must lie in a valley connecting the two sectors . here , the different implementations of the norm condition lead to the same minimal state . with increasing @xmath2 ,",
    "this global minimum gradually moves along this valley from the @xmath235-dominated sector through a cross - over region to the @xmath236-dominated sector .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : occu1014 ] for the smaller asymmetry with @xmath240 , we can also observe that the three - vortex phase undergoes much stronger changes across its range than other phases .",
    "although there is a sharp transition to a phase with @xmath241 , an appreciable amount of the two - vortex basis - state remains and @xmath218 dies out only gradually .",
    "this behavior yields a very complicated picture for smaller interaction strengths ( roughly at @xmath242 ) , where the @xmath241-dominated phase disappears completely leading to a direct transition from two to four vortices . for even smaller @xmath0 , the two - vortex phase",
    "is followed by a one - vortex phase before the four - vortex phase develops . in part",
    ", this complicated picture arises from the suppression of the @xmath241 contribution to the one - vortex phase ( which in the moderately asymmetric trap with @xmath225 leads to an contribution of @xmath226 rather than @xmath241 to the one - vortex phase ) .",
    "the asymmetry in the trap geometry breaks the cylindrical symmetry , so that the angular momentum @xmath5 around the axis of rotation is no longer a good quantum number .",
    "we therefore investigate the effect of the asymmetry on @xmath5 in some detail .    the angular momentum ( in units of @xmath243 ) as a function of the trap rotation @xmath2",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lz ] for all three geometries ( @xmath244 1.0 , 1.014 , and 1.1 ) for the fixed interaction @xmath200 .",
    "the intimate relation to the occupancies within the various phases for each geometry can be seen in the corresponding plots ( figs .",
    "[ fig : occusymm ] ,  [ fig : occu1014 ] , and  [ fig : occu11 ] ) .",
    "the sharp kinks in @xmath5 for the symmetric trap arise from the sudden changes in the occupancies and the different angular momentum carried by the noninteracting states .",
    "the finite slope of the plateaus beyond the second transition reflects the mixing of the various noninteracting states in the variational ground state and the off - center positions of the vortex cores  @xcite .    for the asymmetric rotating trap , even the noninteracting eigenstates @xmath199 with a central @xmath13-fold vortex carry an angular momentum different from @xmath13 ( in fact",
    ", the angular momentum diverges for @xmath245 ) .",
    "the divergence comes from the contribution of the circulating quanta with positive helicity , @xmath246 , occurring in the angular momentum of every basis state @xmath199 .",
    "this is easily seen by expanding @xmath247 for small @xmath248 and small asymmetries @xmath249 , leading to @xmath250 in asymmetric traps , this divergence dominates the angular momentum in all noninteracting eigenstates @xmath199 for high rotation speeds and hence in any linear combinations of them .",
    "thus , even discrete changes in the structure of the equilibrium state ( as at a transition ) will have a far less dramatic effect on the angular momentum at large rotation speeds near @xmath87 .",
    "moreover , asymmetric condensates are significantly elongated along the axis of weaker confinement as @xmath251 .",
    "the resulting redistribution of density ( and mass ) with respect to the axis of rotation produces an additional , nonquantized contribution to the angular momentum .",
    "compared to the symmetric condensate , the angular momentum for the trap with smaller asymmetry at @xmath200 has its jumps smoothed over a small but finite range of @xmath1 because of the continuous transition where one off - center vortex gradually moves towards the center ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : occu1014 ] ) ; in addition , the transition is shifted toward higher rotation speeds ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : lz ] ) .",
    "the subsequent sequence of phases corresponds to an increasing number of vortex cores that cause nearly vertical jumps just as in the symmetric case .",
    "the divergence of the angular momentum dominates only at @xmath252 .    for the moderate asymmetry , the stronger admixture of @xmath218 in the no - vortex phase yields a faster rise of the angular momentum below the first transition .",
    "the first kink is even more tilted because of the extended range for the transition to a one - vortex state . inside this one - vortex phase",
    ", there is a broad region with a pure @xmath129 state ( up to @xmath253 ) . the angular momentum , however , exceeds one because of both the initial growth of @xmath254 with @xmath2 and the deformation of the condensate density .",
    "the rapid rise of @xmath5 below the second transition reflects the growing admixture of @xmath226 .",
    "that second transition , seen as a discontinuous derivative in @xmath5 , occurs at an angular momentum @xmath255 , already exceeding the value for a symmetric trap with two vortices . beyond that point ,",
    "the angular momentum increases smoothly with @xmath2 , even beyond the re - entrant transitions at @xmath256 and @xmath257 respectively ( see inset in fig .  [",
    "fig : inset ] ) . in this limit",
    ", the divergent @xmath254 completely dominates the behavior .",
    "the behavior of a small bose condensate in a rotating anisotropic trap differs significantly from that of a symmetric condensate , even for very small asymmetries . in large part",
    ", this difference arises from the stretching of the condensate along the axis of weak confinement , especially for @xmath251 .",
    "in addition , it reflects the irrotational flow induced by the rotating confining potential that pushes on the gas when viewed from the laboratory frame  @xcite .    for any specific asymmetry and sufficiently small interaction strength ,",
    "a one - vortex state can never be stabilized , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : phdasym ] . for somewhat larger values of the coupling constant @xmath0 ,",
    "the first transition , from a no - vortex state to a one - vortex state , is sharp , but the subsequent transitions are re - entrant , back to a no - vortex state with significant elongation that carries the relevant angular momentum ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : lobe1014 ] and [ fig : densasym ] ) . for these weak interactions ,",
    "the transitions all occur close to @xmath258 , so that the stretching dominates .    for larger interaction strength ( @xmath259 ) ,",
    "the transitions occur at lower values of @xmath1 , and they become quasicontinuous in that the occupation @xmath260 of the noninteracting ground state vanishes smoothly ( see figs .  [ fig : occu1014 ] , [ fig : occu11 ] , and [ fig : denssmall ] ) . as in the case of a classical fluid in a rotating elliptic cylinder  @xcite , the angular momentum is finite even below the transition to a state with one vortex because of the irrotational flow induced by the rotating asymmetric trap ( see fig .
