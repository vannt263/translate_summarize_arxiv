    "the design of magnetic devices used to store and process information crucially relies on a detailed understanding of how the magnetization dynamics are influenced not only by external magnetic fields but also by dissipation and thermal fluctuations  @xcite . in the simplest scenario ,",
    "the time evolution of the magnetization is governed by the stochastic generalization of the landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation introduced by brown to study the relaxation of ferromagnetic nanoparticles  @xcite . in recent years , much attention has been directed to the theoretical and experimental understanding of how the magnetization can be manipulated with spin polarized currents via the spin torque effect originally discussed by slonczewski  @xcite and berger  @xcite , an effect that can be described by a simple generalization of this equation .",
    "explicit analytical solutions to the stochastic llg equation are available in very few cases ; in more general circumstances information has to be obtained by direct numerical simulation of the stochastic equation , the study of the associated fokker - planck equation ( see ref .   for a recent review ) , or via functional methods  @xcite .",
    "the stochastic llg equation is a stochastic equation with _ multiplicative _ noise .",
    "it is a well - known fact that in these cases , a careful analysis of the stochastic integration prescriptions is needed to preserve the physical properties of the model . in the stochastic llg case one",
    "should force the modulus of the magnetization to stay constant during evolution , and different schemes ( ito , stratonovich or the generic ` alpha ' prescription ) require the addition of different drift terms to preserve this property ( for a recent discussion see ref .  ) .",
    "all these issues are by now well - understood and they are also easy to implement in the continuous time treatment of the problem .",
    "nevertheless , this problem has not been analyzed in as much detail in the numerical formulation of the equation .",
    "indeed , most of the works focusing on the numerical analysis of the stochastic equation use cartesian coordinates @xcite . although there is nothing fundamentally wrong with this coordinate system , most algorithms based on it do not preserve , in an automatic way , the norm of the magnetization during time evolution .",
    "these algorithms require the explicit magnetization normalization after every time step , a trick that is often hidden behind other technical difficulties @xcite .",
    "this problem can be avoided only if the specific midpoint prescription ( stratonovich ) is used  @xcite .",
    "given that the modulus of the magnetization should be constant by construction , a more convenient way to describe the time evolution should be to use the spherical coordinate system . despite its naturalness ,",
    "no detailed analysis of this case exists in the literature .",
    "the aim of this work is to present a numerical algorithm to solve the llg equation in the spherical coordinates system and to discuss in detail how different discretization prescriptions are related , an issue which is not trivial due to the multiplicative character of the thermal noise .    in order to make precise statements",
    ", we focus on the study of the low - temperature dynamics of an ellipsoidal cobalt nanoparticle , a system that has been previously studied in great detail by other groups  @xcite .",

    "we first recall the stochastic llg equation in cartesian and spherical coordinates . in both cases",
    "we discuss the drift term needed to ensure the conservation of the magnetization modulus as well as the approach to boltzmann equilibrium .",

    "this equation conserves the modulus of @xmath19 and takes to boltzmann equilibrium _ only if _ the stratonovich , mid - point prescription , stochastic calculus is used .",
    "otherwise , for other stochastic discretization prescriptions , none of these physically expected properties are ensured .",
    "the addition of a carefully chosen drift term is needed to recover the validity of these properties when other stochastic calculi are used .",
    "the generic modified sllg equation  @xcite @xmath20 where the time - derivative has been replaced by the @xmath21-covariant derivative @xmath22 ensures the conservation of the magnetization modulus and convergence to boltzmann equilibrium for any value of @xmath21 .",
    "the reason for the need of an extra term in the covariant derivative is that the chain - rule for time - derivatives of functions of the stochastic variable is not the usual one when generic stochastic calculus is used .",
    "it involves an additional term ( for a detailed explanation see ref .  ) .",
    "in addition , having modified the stochastic equation in this way , one easily proves that the associated fokker - planck equation is independent of @xmath21 and takes the magnetization to its equilibrium boltzmann distribution at temperature @xmath23 provided the parameter @xmath16 is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the volume of the sample that behaves as a single macrospin , @xmath26 the boltzmann constant , and @xmath27 the saturation magnetization .",

    "we think it would be worthwhile to explore , both analytically and numerically , if this is a generic result of the sllg dynamics . _ a priori _ , it is not clear what will be the optimal prescription to deal with other problems such as a system under a non - zero longitudinal external magnetic field or for a more general non - axially symmetric potential @xcite .",
