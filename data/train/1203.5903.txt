    "the chicago board options exchange volatility index ( vix ) provides investors with a mechanism to gain direct exposure to the volatility of the s&p500 index without the need for purchasing index options .",
    "consequently , the trading of vix derivatives has become popular amongst investors . in 2004",
    "futures on the vix began trading and were subsequently followed by options on the vix in 2006 .",
    "furthermore , since the inception of the vix , volatility indices have been created to provide the same service on other indices , in particular , the vdax and the vstoxx , which are based on the dax and the euro stoxx 50 indices respectively . since",
    "derivative products are traded on both the underlying index and the volatility index , it is desirable to employ a model that can simultaneously reproduce the observed characteristics of products on both indices",
    ". models that are capable of capturing these joint characteristics are known as consistent models .",
    "a growing body of literature has been devoted to the joint modelling of equity and vix derivatives .",
    "the literature can generally be classed in terms of two approaches . in the first approach ,",
    "once the instantaneous dynamics of the underlying index are specified under a chosen pricing measure , the discounted price of a derivative can be expressed as a local martingale .",
    "this is the approach adopted in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite derived an analytic formula for vix futures under the assumption that the s&p500 is modelled by a heston diffusion process @xcite .",
    "a more general result was obtained in @xcite . through a characteristic function approach these authors provided exact solutions ( dependent upon a fourier inversion ) for the price of vix derivatives when the s&p500 is modelled by a heston diffusion process with simultaneous jumps in the underlying index and the volatility process . a square - root stochastic variance model with variance jumps and time - dependent parameters",
    "was considered for the evolution of the s&p500 index in @xcite .",
    "the author provided formulae for the pricing and hedging of a variety of volatility derivatives .",
    "alternatively there is the  market - model \" approach , where variance swaps are modelled directly , as is done in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the latter authors proposed a flexible market model that is capable of efficiently pricing realized - variance derivatives , index options , and vix derivatives .",
    "realized - variance derivatives were priced using fourier transforms , index derivatives were priced using a mixing formula , which averages black - scholes model prices , and vix derivatives were priced , subject to an approximation , using fourier - transform methods .",
    "models considered under the first approach generally yield ( quasi-)closed - form solutions for derivative prices , which by definition are tractable .",
    "the challenge lies in ensuring that empirically observed facts from the market data , i.e. characteristic features of the joint dynamics of equity and vix derivatives , are captured . on the other hand ,",
    "the market - model approach ensures by construction that models accurately reflect observed empirical characteristics .",
    "the challenge remaining is to obtain an acceptable level of tractability when pricing derivative products . in this paper",
    "we follow the first approach and consider the joint modelling of equity and vix derivatives when the underlying index follows a 3/2 process @xcite with jumps in the index only ( henceforth called the 3/2 plus jumps model ) .",
    "the model presented here is more parsimonious than competing models from its class ; it is able to accurately capture the joint dynamics of equity and vix derivatives , while retaining the advantage over market models of analytic tractability .",
    "we point out that this model was used in the context of pricing target volatility fund derivatives in @xcite .",
    "the selection of a @xmath0 model for the underlying index is motivated by several observations in recent literature .",
    "there is both empirical and theoretical evidence suggesting that the @xmath0 model is a suitable candidate for modelling instantaneous variance .",
    "@xcite conducted an empirical study on the time - series properties of instantaneous variance by using s&p100 implied volatilities as a proxy .",
    "the authors found that a linear - drift was rejected in favour of a non - linear drift and estimated that a variance exponent of approximately 1.3 was required to fit the data . in a separate study ,",
    "@xcite proposed a new framework for pricing variance swaps and were able to support the findings of @xcite using a purely theoretical argument .",
    "furthermore , the excellent results obtained by @xcite , who employed the 3/2 model to price realized - variance derivatives , naturally encourage the application of the 3/2 framework to vix derivatives . despite having a qualitative advantage over other stochastic volatility models",
    "@xcite , the @xmath0 model , or any augmented version of this model , has yet to be applied to the consistent pricing of equity and vix derivatives .",
    "the final motivating factor is the claim that jumps must be included in the dynamics of the underlying index to capture the upward - sloping implied volatility skew of vix options @xcite . in related literature the only mention of the @xmath0 model in the context of vix derivatives is in @xcite , where the problem is approached from the perspective of directly modelling the vix .",
    "closed - form solutions are found for vix derivatives under the assumption that the vix follows a @xmath0 process . in this paper a markedly different approach is adopted . rather than specifying dynamics for the untradable vix , without providing a connection to the underlying index ,",
    "we follow the approach from @xcite , where the dynamics of the underlying index are specified and an expression for the vix is later derived .",
    "our approach is superior to that of @xcite ; issues of consistency are addressed directly and the model lends itself to a more intuitive interpretation .",
    "the main contribution of this paper is the derivation of quasi - closed - form solutions for the pricing of vix derivatives under the assumption that the underlying follows the 3/2 model .",
    "the newly - found solutions retain the analytic tractability enjoyed by those found in the context of realized - variance products @xcite .",
    "the formulae derived in this paper allow for a numerical analysis to be performed to assess the appropriateness of the 3/2 framework for consistent modelling .",
    "upon performing the analysis we find that the pure - diffusion 3/2 model is capable of producing the commonly observed upward - sloping skew for vix options .",
    "this contradicts the previously made claims that pure - diffusion stochastic volatility models can not consistently model vix and equity derivatives @xcite .",
    "this desirable property distinguishes the 3/2 model from competing pure - diffusion stochastic volatility models .",
    "we compare the 3/2 model to the heston model and find that the latter produces downward - sloping implied volatilities for vix options , whereas the former produces upward - sloping implied volatilities for vix options .",
    "pure - diffusion volatility models , however , fail to capture features of implied volatility in equity options for short maturities @xcite . to remedy this shortcoming jumps",
    "are introduced in the underlying index .",
    "the resulting @xmath0 plus jumps model is consequently studied in detail : first , by following the approach used for the pure - diffusion 3/2 model , we derive the conditions that ensure that the discounted stock price is a martingale under the pricing measure .",
    "the novelty of this result is that we discuss whether a stochastic volatility model that allows for jumps is a martingale .",
    "so far in the literature @xcite these results have been provided for pure - diffusion processes only , as they are based on feller explosion tests @xcite .",
    "next , we produce the joint fourier - laplace transform of the logarithm of the index and the realized variance , which allows for the pricing of equity and realized - variance derivatives . though the @xmath0 model is not affine",
    ", we find that the joint fourier - laplace transform is exponentially affine in the logarithm of the stock price .",
    "this allows for the simultaneous pricing of equity options across many strikes via the use of the fourier - cosine expansion method of @xcite .",
    "such a finding is expected to significantly speed up the calibration procedure .",
    "the approach used in this paper is not restricted to the 3/2 plus jumps model and can be extended to a more general setting .",
    "in fact , we use this approach to obtain a closed - form solution for vix options in the stochastic volatility plus jumps ( svj ) model , see @xcite , resulting in a small extension of the stochastic - volatility pricing formula presented in @xcite .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section 2 we introduce the pure - diffusion @xmath0 model and present the empirical result that illustrates that this model is able to capture the joint characteristics of equity and index options .",
    "we compare the pure - diffusion 3/2 model with the heston model to highlight the difference in shape of the vix implied volatilities . the rest of the paper",
    "is concerned with the 3/2 plus jumps model .",
    "section 3 introduces the 3/2 plus jumps model and establishes the conditions that ensure that the discounted stock price is a martingale under the assumed pricing measure .",
    "next , characteristic functions for the logarithm of the index and the realized variance are derived .",
    "finally , a quasi - analytic formula for call and put options on the vix is derived .",
    "conclusions are stated in section [ secconc ] .",
    "in this section we introduce the pure - diffusion @xmath0 model and present numerical results to illustrate that this model is able to produce upward - sloping implied volatility skews in vix options . on a probability space @xmath1",
    ", we introduce the risk - neutral dynamics for the stock price and the variance processes @xmath2 starting at @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively , where @xmath5 is a two - dimensional brownian motion under the risk - neutral measure .",
    "all stochastic processes are adapted to a filtration @xmath6}$ ] that satisfies the usual conditions with @xmath7 being the trivial sigma field .",
    "furthermore , @xmath8 denotes the constant risk - free interest rate and @xmath9 the instantaneous correlation between the return on the index and the variance process . as per usual",
    ", @xmath9 satisfies @xmath10 and @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 are assumed to be strictly positive .",
    "it is worth noting that unlike the heston model the above model has a non - linear drift .",
    "the speed of mean reversion is not constant , as is the case for the heston model , but is now a stochastic quantity and is proportional to the instantaneous variance .    throughout this paper",
    "we follow @xcite and @xcite and define the vix via @xmath14 where @xmath15 .",
    "we emphasize that this approach is superior to that of @xcite ; instead of modelling the vix directly , without providing a connection to the underlying index , the expression for the vix in equation is derived directly from the dynamics of the underlying index .    implied volatilities of vix options",
    "exhibit a positive volatility skew , as stated in @xcite .",
    "the author asserts that  sv [ stochastic volatility models ] without jumps are not consistent with the implied volatility skew observed in options on the vix ... \" and that  ... only the sv [ stochastic volatility ] model with appropriately chosen jumps can fit the implied vix skew \" . to assess these statements we calculate implied volatilities under the pure - diffusion @xmath0 model .",
    "the price of a call option on the vix is now given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 denotes the probability density function of a non - central chi - squared random variable with @xmath22 degrees of freedom , and non - centrality parameter @xmath23 .",
    "equation is a special case of the forthcoming proposition [ propderivvix ] .    in order to provide the reader with parameters that are verifiable",
    "we use the parameters provided in @xcite for realized - variance derivatives . using equation and the parameters @xmath24 we price vix options for @xmath25 months and @xmath26 months . then using black s formula we find an implied volatility , @xmath27 , such that @xmath28 where @xmath29     model parameters obtained in @xcite with @xmath25 months ( left ) and @xmath26 months ( right).[fig3over2implvols],title=\"fig : \" ] model parameters obtained in @xcite with @xmath25 months ( left ) and @xmath26 months ( right).[fig3over2implvols],title=\"fig : \" ]    the positive skew of the implied volatility of vix options is shown in figure [ fig3over2implvols ] for maturities @xmath25 months and @xmath26 months , demonstrating that the dynamics of the pure - diffusion 3/2 model are in fact rich enough to fit the implied vix skew .",
    "these observations support the findings of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite that suggest that the @xmath0 model is a good candidate for the pricing of volatility derivatives .",
    "next we compare the results produced by the @xmath0 model to the heston model , which is commonly used for the pricing vix derivatives @xcite .",
    "a priori this seems to be a fair comparison ; both models are stochastic volatility models , the two models have the same number of parameters , and enjoy the same level of analytical tractability .",
    "to compute vix option prices and the corresponding implied volatilities we use the pricing formula provided by @xcite ( see their proposition 3 ) .",
    "again , we use the following parameters obtained in @xcite for the heston model , @xmath30 the result is shown in figure [ fighestonimplvols ] .",

    ", we calibrate the pure - diffusion @xmath0 model to short - maturity s&p500 option data . in figure [ fig3over2fit ]",
    "we present option implied volatilities for the s&p500 on the 8th march 2012 for a maturity of nine days .",

    ", there has been a growing body of literature dealing with the question of whether the discounted stock price in a particular stochastic volatility model is a martingale or a strict local martingale under the pricing measure , e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
