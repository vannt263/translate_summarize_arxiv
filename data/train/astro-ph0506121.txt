    "systems are observed in steady or quasi  steady state during this process ( e.g , cvs , lmxbs and agns ) .",
    "some external agent ( e.g. , the interstellar medium , a companion star ) provides a continuous supply of mass , energy and angular momentum over a timescale that is much longer than the accretion time . the energy dissipated by the flow",
    "before it is accreted , and more importantly , what happens to this energy , determines many of the properties of the flow itself . in most cases cooling",

    "disk theory developed by @xcite , it is extremely efficient , maintaining a `` cool '' ( in the sense that @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the mass of the central object ) and thin ( with a scale height @xmath3 ) , nearly keplerian disk . the requirements of steady state , hydrostatic equilibrium in the vertical direction , energy and angular momentum balance , and an equation of state yield a solution for all relevant variables as a function of the disk radius , @xmath4 . the key question of angular momentum transport was addressed by shakura & sunyaev with their famous @xmath5 prescription , which allows a parametrization of the viscous stresses and energy dissipation rates .",
    "magnetic fields could be at the physical origin this effect , through the magneto  rotational instability ( mri , * ? ? ?",

    "in the case of inefficient cooling , a solution was found in the 1970s for so  called slim disks @xcite , and later for a class that became known as adafs ( advection dominated accretion flows , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this case , the cooling is negligible , either because the optical depth is large , or because the density is so low that the radiative efficiency is extremely small .",
    "the dissipated energy is advected with the flow and may be absorbed by the central object .",
    "such flows are geometrically thick , with scale heights @xmath6",
    ". what little radiation does emerge from them arises , as in the thin disks , through various electromagnetic processes .    in either of the above scenarios , accretion ( and the accompanying radiation )",
    "is usually thought to be limited by the eddington rate , a self  regulatory balance imposed by newtonian gravity and radiation pressure .",
    "the standard argument gives a maximum luminosity @xmath7  erg  s@xmath8 .",
    "although this may not be strictly the case in reality  as in the current argument concerning the nature of ulxs observationally @xcite , and also quite general theoretical considerations @xcite  it does exhibit the qualitative nature of the effect of radiation pressure on accreting plasma , in the limit of large optical depth .",
    "the problem is circumvented ( or at least deferred by nearly sixteen orders of magnitude in luminosity ) if the main cooling agent is emission of neutrinos , instead of photons .",
    "this regime requires correspondingly large accretion rates , of the order of one solar mass per second , and is termed hypercritical accretion @xcite .",
    "it is important , for example , in the context of post  supernova fallback accretion onto a proto  neutron star .",
    "in such a situation , the densities and temperatures are so large ( @xmath9  g  @xmath10 , @xmath11  k ) that photons are completely trapped , and energetic neutrinos are emitted in large amounts , cooling the gas and allowing accretion to proceed .",
    "the reader may wish to consult the very clear introduction in this context given by @xcite .",
    "when the stellar envelope experiences fallback onto the central object , the system may be considered to be nearly in a steady state , because of the timescales involved .",
    "there are other , more violent situations , relevant to the study of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) in which the assumption of steady state is not justified because of a time  varying mass and energy supply , and which therefore require a dynamical analysis for their proper description .    in general , whether the system cools via electromagnetic radiation or neutrinos , analytic steady state solutions are found by assuming that the cooling is either efficient ( thin disk ) or inefficient ( thick disk ) . over the last several years",
    ", many groups have considered these cases in the neutrino cooled regime @xcite and established the general features of the solutions .",
    "the real solution may be very different , in particular ( and in what concerns us for the following ) because of the previous history of the gas that constituted the accretion disk and how the disk formed .",
    "it turns out this may be quite important in the case of grbs .",
    "numerical analysis of the evolution of the disk with no assumptions concerning the steady state has been carried out by @xcite .",
    "they have reported a three dimensional calculation with detailed microphysics .",
    "unfortunately , computational limitations do not allow one to continue such calculations for more than approximately 50  ms , whereas the typical short grb lasts 0.2  s.    the sources of grbs are now established ( at least based on observations of x  ray , optical and radio counterparts ) to lie at cosmological distances , with redshifts @xmath12 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein )",
    ". at such scales , the absolute energetics of each event is approximately @xmath13  erg , assuming isotropic emission .",
    "apparent collimation inferred from achromatic breaks in the afterglow light curve may reduce this to @xmath14  erg , depending on the particular event @xcite . although one generally considers two classes of grbs based on duration ( shorter and longer than about 2  s , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , all afterglows to date ( and the corresponding inferences ) come from long bursts ( although see * ? ? ?",
    "strong evidence in favor of a sn / grb association @xcite now comes from several events ( albeit all relatively nearby ) , hinting at an underlying physical connection between the two phenomena .",
    "this is the central basis of the collapsar model @xcite , in which rotation of the pre ",
    "supernova star allows for the creation of a massive accretion disk , fed by the infalling stellar envelope .",
    "the grb is then powered for a fallback time , which can be long enough to account for the observed durations . in the case of short bursts",
    "there is less evidence to go on , but one possibility is that they arise from compact binary mergers , with various combinations of black holes and neutron stars in the binary @xcite such as in the first binary pulsar to be discovered @xcite . the tidal disruption of one star by the other gives rise to an accretion disk which powers the grb .",
    "a black hole is either present from the start ( as a variation of the hulse  taylor system ) or is produced by the collapse of a supramassive neutron star shortly after the merger itself . in this case",
    "there is no external agent feeding the accretion disk , and thus the event is over roughly on an accretion timescale ( which would be on the order of one second ) .",
    "clearly , investigating either of these scenarios requires time  dependent , multidimensional calculations with detailed microphysics @xcite .",
    "the energy released by accretion is then transformed into a relativistic outflow which produces the gamma ray burst ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for reviews ) .",
    "we note that either scenario would produce a distinct gravitational wave signal , which could in principle be detected by interferometric systems such as ligo in the future , thus establishing the nature of the progenitor system without a doubt .",
    "the regime in which the gas lies is unlike any other commonly encountered in astrophysics .",
    "the high densities and temperatures lead to photodisintegration of the nuclei and the establishment of nuclear statistical equilibrium ( nse ) .",
    "furthermore , neutronization becomes important in the innermost regions of the flow and weak interactions determine the composition , with the electron fraction falling substantially below 1/2 , and the gas correspondingly becoming neutron  rich .",
    "if this composition is somehow frozen and transported out of the gas and into an outflow , interesting nucleosynthesis of heavy elements could occur @xcite .",
    "realistic physics input of this kind allow us to obtain more reliable estimates of the actual energy released from the disk , and potentially available to power a grb . an added complication , which affects the composition @xcite is that even if the main cooling mechanism is neutrino emission , these are not entirely free to leave the system , as scattering ( mainly off free nucleons ) is important enough to suppress the emission in the dense inner disk .",
    "we find that in fact the opaqueness of the material may lead to convection through the establishment of a composition gradient that does not satisfy the classical requirements for stability . to our knowledge , this is the first time that this has been addressed in this context .    in previous work we initially studied the merger process for black hole ",

    "follow  up",
    "work used the results of these simulations , mapped to two dimensions in azimuthal symmetry , as initial conditions with simple ( ideal gas ) input physics , and no realistic cooling included @xcite .",
    "a first approximation at a realistic equation of state and the effects of neutrino opacities was reported more recently @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we improve upon our earlier results in three important ways , that make them more realistic , and particularly relevant to the study of grbs .",
    "first , we use a much more detailed equation of state , appropriate for the actual physical conditions found in post  merger accretion disks .",
    "this includes a relativistic electron gas of arbitrary degeneracy , radiation pressure and an ideal gas of free nucleons and @xmath5 particles .",
    "the composition is determined self  consistently by considering weak interactions in two different regimes : neutrino  opaque and neutrino  transparent .",
    "second , we include neutrino emission as the main source of cooling , by considering the relevant reaction rates ( electron and positron capture onto free nucleons , bremsstrahlung , pair annihilation and plasmon decays ) , taken from tables and fitting formulae valid over wide ranges of temperature and density whenever possible .",
    "third , we compute an approximate optical depth for the fluid to neutrinos , using scattering off free nucleons and @xmath5 particles as a source of opacity . the emission rates and pressure due to neutrinos",
    "are then suppressed and enhanced , respectively , by an appropriate factor .",
    "we begin this paper by a presentation of the physical conditions likely to occur in post  merger accretion disks in  [ pmdisks ] , immediately following the coalescence of the two compact objects .",
    "our results follow in  [ results ] , and a discussion of these , and the implications they have for grbs is presented in  [ ccl ] .",
    "the accurate study of the dynamical evolution of the accretion disks requires knowledge of the physical conditions within them , and the use of an appropriate equation of state .",
    "below we give a general overview of the physical conditions in the disk , followed by a detailed presentation of the equation of state and the effects of neutrinos .",
    "the accretion structures that are formed as a result of the merger of two neutron stars or the tidal disruption of a neutron star by the black hole become azimuthally symmetric fairly quickly , within a few tens of milliseconds @xcite .",
    "these disks typically contain a few tenths of a solar mass , and are small , with the bulk of the mass being contained within 200  km of the black hole ( which harbors about 35 solar masses ) .",
    "the disks are dense ( @xmath15}\\leq 10^{12}$ ] ) , with high internal energies ( @xmath16}\\leq10^{11}$ ] ) ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , the temperature is high enough that nuclei become photodisintegrated and there is a mixture of @xmath5 particles , free neutrons and protons , electrons and positrons .",
    "the timescale for @xmath17equilibrium is given by @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the cross section for @xmath0 capture onto free nucleons and @xmath20 is the number density of free nucleons ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . under these conditions , @xmath21  s , which is much shorter than the accretion timescale @xmath22 of a fluid element , so that weak interactions determine the composition .",
    "photons are trapped and are advected with the flow .",
    "for neutrinos the situation is more complicated , since the optical depth is of order unity . in the outer regions of the disk , they escape freely , whereas for densities larger than @xmath23  g  @xmath10 they undergo diffusion on a timescale @xmath24  ms .      for simplicity of presentation",
    ", we will first assume that all nucleons are free ( no @xmath5 particles are present ) , and include the necessary corrections subsequently .    under the conditions described above , the temperature is high enough for electron ",
    "positron pair creation .",
    "the number of pairs thus produced is very sensitive to the degeneracy of the electrons .",
    "in fact the number density of pairs is suppressed exponentially with increasing degeneracy , because of fermi blocking . in previous work",
    "@xcite the assumption of full degeneracy has been made for simplicity ( note also that in some cases the presence of electron  positron pairs has been assumed while at the same time retaining a degeneracy pressure term , which is inconsistent ) .",
    "here we take a different approach , using an exact expression for the pressure as a function of the temperature and the chemical potential , valid for arbitrary degeneracy in the limit of relativistic electrons ( i.e. , @xmath25  g  @xmath10 ) , due to @xcite , namely :    @xmath26 .   \\label{pe}\\ ] ]    the number densities of electrons and positrons are related by : @xmath27 \\label{ye}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the electron fraction .",
    "the chemical potential of species @xmath29 is denoted by @xmath30 throughout .",
    "this expression reduces to the well  known limits when the temperature is low ( @xmath31 , which gives @xmath32 , appropriate for a cold relativistic fermi gas ) and when it is high ( @xmath33 , which gives @xmath34 , when the pressure comes from relativistic electron  positron pairs ) .",
    "the full equation of state then reads : @xmath35 where @xmath36 @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the pressure due to neutrinos ( discussed below ) . here",
    "@xmath39 is the radiation constant , @xmath40 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath41  g is the atomic mass unit . since the presence of pairs is automatically taken into account in the expression for @xmath42 , there is no alteration to the numerical factor @xmath43 in the expression for @xmath44 . for the conditions encountered in the accretion disks presented below , gas pressure dominates at the 80% level over the other terms . regarding the photons ,",
    "since the temperature is @xmath45  mev , the peak in the blackbody spectrum is at @xmath46  mev . on the other hand , the plasma frequency , @xmath47 ,",
    "corresponds to @xmath48  mev .",
    "thus the standard expression for radiation pressure may be considered accurate , and plasma effects negligible as far as the photons are concerned .",
    "the computation of the electron fraction and the chemical potential of electrons follows from the assumption of @xmath17equilibrium between neutrons , protons and electrons , and the condition of charge neutrality .",
    "as noted by @xcite , a distinction needs to be made to determine the equilibrium composition depending on the optical depth of the material ( the determination of the opacities is presented in   [ nuopacities ] ) . if it is transparent to its own neutrino emission , we fix equilibrium by equating the capture rates of electrons and positrons onto protons and neutrons respectively . for mild degeneracy ,",
    "as is the case here , this leads to the following expression for the electron fraction as a function of the temperature and the electron chemical potential @xcite : @xmath49 where @xmath50  mev .",
    "if , however , the material is opaque , and the neutrinos are allowed to diffuse out on a timescale shorter than the accretion timescale , then we may write @xmath51 for the equilibrium composition , and is strictly valid only when there are equal numbers of neutrinos and anti  neutrinos . otherwise the electron pressure , bulk viscosity and joule  like heating due to the induced lepton current will be affected @xcite .",

    "the internal energy per unit mass , @xmath58 , is used instead of the pressure to solve equation ( [ eos ] ) , since its variation in time is what is determined in the code , using the first law of thermodynamics .",
    "we finally include the effects of incomplete photodisintegration of @xmath5 particles by using nuclear statistical equilibrium for the three species @xmath59 to fix the mass fraction of free nucleons as @xcite : @xmath60}\\right)^{9/8 } \\ , \\left(\\frac{\\rho}{10^{10}\\mbox{g~cm$^{-3}$}}\\right)^{-3/4 } \\ , \\exp(-8.2 [ 10^{10}\\mbox{k}]/t).\\label{nuc}\\ ] ]",
    "whenever this expression results in @xmath61 we set @xmath62 .",
    "the corresponding alterations in the previous derivation are simple , and lead to the full set of equations which we write for each gas element and at each time .",

    "the modifications to the equation for @xmath17 equilibrium simply reflect the fact that if the fluid is composed primarily of @xmath5 particles , there will be one neutron per proton , and hence @xmath66 .",
    "several processes contribute to the emission of neutrinos .",
    "first , we take into account electron and positron capture onto free nucleons using the tables of @xcite .",
    "this is an improvement over calculations done previously @xcite , where assumptions concerning the degeneracy were made .",
    "the rates are thus accurate over the entire disk , whether the degeneracy is significant or not .",

    "a bilinear interpolation in the @xmath69 plane is performed using the table to obtain the cooling rate for a given mass element .",
    "the result is then multiplied by the mass fraction of free nucleons , @xmath70 , since we are not considering capture of electrons and protons by @xmath5 particles .",
    "second , the annihilation of electron  positron pairs is a source of thermal neutrinos , and the corresponding cooling rate is computed using the fitting functions of @xcite .",

    "for the conditions encountered in the disk , capture by nucleons completely dominates all other processes , and is the main source of cooling .",
    "finally , the creation and disintegration of @xmath5 particles leads to a cooling term in the energy equation given by : @xmath78      the material in the disk is dense enough that photons are completely trapped , and advected with the flow .",
    "for neutrinos however , the situation is more complicated , since the outer regions are transparent to them , while the inner portions are opaque .",

    "so the mean free path is @xmath86 , @xmath20 and @xmath87 being the number densities of free nucleons and @xmath5 particles respectively . to compute an optical depth , we take @xmath88 , with @xmath89 a typical scale height of the disk",

    "its influence is limited , since when @xmath70 varies from 0 to 1 , the optical depth is altered by a factor 1.2 , all other values being equal . in practice , and for the compositions found in the disks , this expression corresponds to having an optical depth of unity at approximately @xmath96 g  @xmath10 , which can be thought of as a neutrino  surface , where the last scattering occurs and neutrinos leave the system .",

    "this is a two dimensional ( cylindrical coordinates @xmath101 in azimuthal symmetry ) smooth particle hydrodynamics code @xcite , modified from our own 3d version used for compact binary mergers @xcite .",
    "the accretion disk sits in the potential well of a black hole of mass @xmath102 , and which produces a newtonian potential @xmath103 .",
    "accretion is modeled by an absorbing boundary at the schwarzschild radius @xmath104 , and the mass of the hole is updated continuously .",
    "the transport of angular momentum is modeled with an @xmath5 viscosity prescription , including _ all _ components of the viscous stress tensor ( not only @xmath105 ) .",
    "gravity of the disk is neglected .",
    "the main modifications from the previous version are in the implementation of a new equation of state  [ eoscomp ] , neutrino emission ,  [ nuemission ] and the treatment of neutrino optical depths ,  [ nuopacities ] .",
    "as done previously @xcite , the initial conditions are taken from the final configuration of 3d calculations of black hole ",
    "neutron star mergers , after the accretion disk that forms through tidal disruption of the neutron star has become fairly symmetric with respect to the azimuthal coordinate .",
    "we show in table  [ table : ics ] the parameters used in each of the dynamical runs included in this paper .",
    "as the dynamical evolution calculations begins , the disks experience an initial transient , which is essentially numerical in origin , and is due to the fact that the configuration is not in strict hydrostatic equilibrium ( recall that it is obtained from azimuthally averaging the results of 3d calculations ) .",
    "this transient , and its effects , are negligible , and it is essentially over in a hydrodynamical timescale ( @xmath106  ms ) .",
    "after that , the disk proceeds to evolve on a much longer timescale , determined by accretion onto the central black hole .",
    "we first present the details of the spatial structure of the disk due to fundamental physical effects , and then proceed to show the temporal evolution and associated transitions .",
    "the fundamental variable affecting the instantaneous spatial structure of the disk is the optical depth to neutrinos , @xmath107 , since it determines whether the fluid cools efficiently or not .",
    "all quantities show a radical change in behavior as the threshold @xmath108 is passed .",
    "figure  [ compa0.01t100 ] shows color  coded contours in a meridional slice of the thermodynamical variables , while figure  [ compa0.01t100r ] displays the run of density and entropy per baryon along the equator , @xmath109 , where the density and temperature are highest ( we will refer here mainly to run a2 m , unless noted otherwise )",

    "the critical density for opaqueness is reached at @xmath112  cm , and for @xmath113 , @xmath114 .",

    "the flattening of the entropy profile is related to the change in composition in the optically thick region and the occurrence of convection ( see   [ nuconvection ] below ) .",
    "as the density rises in the inner regions of the disk , the electron fraction @xmath28 initially drops as neutronization becomes more important , with the equilibrium composition being determined by the equality of electron and positron captures onto free neutrons and protons ( see equation  ( [ yethin ] ) and the discussion preceding it ) .",

    "most of the gas lies close to the line determining the formation of helium nuclei ( see equation  [ nuc ] ) , but does not cross over to lower temperatures .",
    "the reason for this is that the energy that would be released by the creation of one helium nucleus ( 28.3  mev ) would not leave the disk ( recall that we consider neutrino emission as the only source of cooling ) and thus immediately lead to the photodisintegration of another @xmath5 particle .",
    "an equilibrium is thus maintained in which the gas is close to helium synthesis , but this does not occur . in the opaque regime ,",

    "the disk straddles this line , with a degeneracy parameter @xmath131 in the inner regions , and @xmath132 at lower densities . thus making the approximation that the electrons in the flow are fully degenerate is not accurate .    modeling the accretion flow in two dimensions @xmath101 , without the assumption of equatorial symmetry allows one to solve clearly for the vertical motions in the disk , something which is not possible when considering vertically  integrated flows .",
    "it was pointed out by @xcite that a standard @xmath5 viscosity could lead to meridional flows in which @xmath133 changed sign as a function of height above the mid plane , leading to inflows as well as outflows .",

    "we show in figure  [ velcont ] the velocity field and magnitude of meridional velocity for run a2 m .",
    "the small  scale eddies are clearly visible , with their strength usually diminishing as the disk is drained of matter and the density drops .",

    "the large , coherent lines of flow aimed directly at the origin for @xmath136 correspond to inflow , while the lighter shades along the equator at larger radii show outflowing gas .",
    "the instantaneous structure of the disk concerning the density , temperature and composition profiles is largely independent of the viscosity , as long as there is enough mass to produce the optically thin / optically thick transition . even in the optically thin regime ,",

    "the reason for this is the following : a central assumption in the standard solution is that the disk is cool , i.e. , @xmath138 .",
    "this comes from the requirement that all the energy dissipated by viscosity , @xmath139 be radiated away efficiently , and produce the observed flux , @xmath140 . in our case ,",
    "the disk is most certainly not cool , as it originates from the tidal disruption of a neutron star by a black hole ( or possibly the coalescence of two neutron stars , and subsequent collapse of the central mass to a black hole ) .",
    "the gas that constitutes the disk is dynamically hot because it was in hydrostatic equilibrium in a self  gravitating configuration , where @xmath141 and has not been able to release this internal energy ( the merger process itself may lead to additional heating ) .",
    "a further deviation from the standard solution is that the pressure support in the disk leads to a rotation curve that is slightly sub  keplerian .",
    "the dissipation by viscosity is in fact smaller than the cooling rate over much of the disk , and the released luminosity comes from a combination of viscous dissipation and the store of internal energy given to the disk at its conception .",
    "the classical requirement for convective instability in the presence of entropy and composition gradients , as well as rotation , is the solberg  hoiland criterion @xcite : @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the radial epicyclic frequency ( @xmath144 being the angular velocity ) , and @xmath145 \\label{bv}\\ ] ] is the brunt  visla frequency ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "the adiabatic index @xmath146 in our case , since @xmath147 is the most important contribution to the total pressure .",
    "thus a region may be convectively unstable because of a composition gradient , or an entropy gradient , or both . strictly speaking , here one should consider the total lepton fraction @xmath148 .",
    "we do not consider the transport of neutrinos in detail , as already mentioned ( see   [ nuopacities ] ) , and do not calculate explicitly the contribution of neutrinos to this @xmath148 .",
    "for what follows , we will thus simply take @xmath28 to represent the behavior of the full @xmath148 .",
    "the origin of convection in the lepton inversion zone can be understood as follows @xcite .",
    "consider a fluid element in the lepton inversion zone that is displaced in the outward direction and then comes to pressure equilibrium with its surroundings . the displaced element , which is lepton rich relative to its new surroundings , attains the ambient pressure at a lower density than the surrounding fluid , because the pressure depends directly on the lepton number , and thus tends to drift outwards . by the same token , an inwardly displaced fluid element in the lepton inversion zone",
    "is depleted in leptons relative to its new surroundings and thus tends to sink .",
    "when temperature gradients are allowed for , the displaced fluids , in general , have temperatures which differ from those of their surroundings .",
    "these variations tend to promote stability or instability depending on whether the existing temperature gradient is less than or greater than the adiabatic gradient , respectively .    in the present scenario",
    "then , the transition to the optically thick regime leads to instability , because initially @xmath149 , and also @xmath150 ( see also figure  [ compa0.01t100r ] ) .",
    "the entropy profile is then flattened by efficient convective mixing , and the lepton gradient inversion is due to the different way in which the composition is determined through weak interactions once the neutrinos become trapped . in a dynamical situation such as the one treated here , convection tends to erase the gradients which give rise to it .",
    "accordingly , the sum of the corresponding terms in equation  ( [ sh ] ) tends to zero once the simulation has progressed and convection has become established in the inner disk ( note that in our case the rotation curve there is sub  keplerian , with @xmath151 , so that @xmath144 and @xmath152 are not equal ) .",
    "this is analogous to what occurs in proto neutron stars following core collapse @xcite and has actually been confirmed in numerical simulations of such systems @xcite , where the convection leads to strong mixing . for a neutrino  driven convective luminosity @xmath153 at radius @xmath154 and density @xmath155 ,",
    "the convective velocity may be estimated by standard mixing length theory as ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath156 where we have used the fact that gas pressure dominates in the fluid .",
    "the assumption of spherical symmetry implicit in this expression is not strictly met in our case , but it may provide us nevertheless with a useful guide .",
    "the overturn time of a convective cell is then given by @xmath157 ms , where @xmath158  km is the mixing length , usually set to a pressure scale height . in our calculations , we see that the magnitude of the meridional velocity @xmath159 decreases as @xmath4 decreases , then rises again as the opaque region is reached , reaching @xmath160  cm  s@xmath8 , at @xmath161  km .",
    "the associated turnover times are thus @xmath162  ms , in good agreement with the estimate made above .    to isolate this effect from that due to viscosity ( which generates the meridional circulations mentioned previously ) we have performed a simulation in which @xmath163 ( run aim in table  [ table : ics ] ) .",
    "this calculation shows essentially no accretion onto the black hole except for a small amount of gas transferred at early times ( because the initial condition is not in strict equilibrium ) .",
    "the result concerning the profile of @xmath28 as a function of radius is as we have described above , i.e. , increasing neutronization as @xmath4 decreases , until the opaque region is reached , followed by an increase in @xmath28 as the black hole boundary is approached .",
    "the revealing difference lies in the time evolution of this profile .",
    "as mentioned above , convection generates motions which tend to eliminate the composition gradient which drives it . in the presence of viscosity",
    ", matter is continuously transported radially , and the gradient is not erased entirely .",
    "height integrated profiles of @xmath164 at 50  ms and 200  ms show a similar behavior at small radii . when viscosity is removed , the initial composition gradient is gradually softened until it disappears in the innermost regions ( see figure  [ convection ] ) .",
    "the disk then has a nearly constant electron fraction along the equator for @xmath113 , with a sharp transition region leading to an increase with radius in the transparent regime .",
    "this may resemble the convection dominated accretion solution found analytically by @xcite and numerically by several groups @xcite , where convection transports angular momentum inward , energy outward , and gives a radial profile in density @xmath165 .",
    "we find a different power law , with @xmath114 .",
    "there are several factors which may account for this difference : the disk vs. spherical geometry ; the initial condition with a large amount of internal energy ; and the limited , but present cooling rate on the boundaries of the flow .",
    "since the neutrinos are diffusing out of the fluid ( the mean free path is small compared to the size of the system in the optically thick regime ) , one would expect a corresponding viscosity through @xmath166 ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this needs to be compared to the corresponding viscosity generated by the assumed @xmath5 prescription for consistency .",
    "we may assume @xmath167 , where @xmath168 is the energy density associated with neutrinos , and @xmath169 is their mean free path ( see   [ nuopacities ] ) .",
    "thus @xmath170 for conditions near the equatorial plane , @xmath109 .",
    "this value will increase in the outer regions , since the mean free path becomes larger as the density drops . at the neutrino ",
    "surface , where @xmath171 , the mean free path is @xmath172  cm , and so an averaged value of the viscosity over the entire neutrino  opaque region will result in an increase of about one order of magnitude over the estimate given in equation  ( [ nuvisc ] ) ( note however , that strictly speaking the diffusion approximation is no longer valid in the outer regions , so this must be interpreted with care ) . for the @xmath5 prescription , @xmath173 .",
    "the rotation curve is not too far from keplerian , and scaling this expression to typical values we find @xmath174 the effects on angular momentum transport are thus a full two orders of magnitude below those arising from our viscosity prescription ( for @xmath175 ) . to put it another way , a lower limit for the viscosity under these conditions ( and in the optically thick portion of the disk )",
    "would be @xmath176 .",
    "an alternative analysis would be to consider the corresponding timescales induced by this viscosity .",
    "since @xmath177 , smaller viscosities imply longer timescales , as expected .      aside from convection ,",
    "several general criteria for stability can be analyzed in our case .",
    "evidently , since we are performing dynamical calculations , any instability that arises will quickly lead to a change in structure .",
    "it is nevertheless instructive to consider the corresponding conditions within the disk .",
    "we first consider the toomre criterion , comparing gravitational and internal energies , with @xmath178 where @xmath152 is the local epicyclic frequency ( essentially equal in this case to the angular frequency @xmath144 ) , @xmath179 is the local sound speed and @xmath180 is the surface density .",
    "we find @xmath181 in all cases throughout the calculations , and thus that the disks are stable in this respect ( figure  [ qthermalstability]a shows a typical profile of @xmath182 $ ] ) .",
    "previous studies @xcite have shown that neutrino cooled disks are thermally unstable if radiation pressure dominates in the flow , and stable otherwise , although the effects of neutrino opacities were not considered .",
    "the criterion for stability can be written in this case as @xmath183 where @xmath184 and @xmath185 are the volume heating and cooling rates .",
    "essentially , in order to be stable the disk must be able to get rid of any excess internal energy generated by an increase in the heating rate .",
    "we show in figure  [ qthermalstability]b typical values for @xmath184 and @xmath185 as functions of the central ( equatorial ) temperature , for run a2 m at @xmath186  ms . in the optically thin region",
    "the disks are thermally stable , because the pressure is dominated by the contribution from free nucleons and cooling is efficient . in the optically thick region",
    "the cooling is greatly suppressed and the criterion would indicate that the disk becomes thermally unstable .",
    "this is reasonable , since with optical depths @xmath187 , essentially no direct cooling takes place , and dissipation is not suppressed .",
    "this is why the disk is geometrically thick in the inner regions , as already described above (   [ structure ] ) .",
    "the balance that gives a quasi  steady state structure is achieved mainly through the diffusion of neutrinos , since the diffusion timescale is shorter than the accretion timescale .",
    "the evolution of the disk on long timescales is determined by the balance between two competing effects : on one hand , viscosity transports angular momentum outwards , matter accretes and the disk drains into the black hole on an accretion timescale @xmath188 .",
    "the trend in this respect is towards lower densities and temperatures . on the other hand",
    ", cooling reduces pressure support and leads to vertical compression , increasing the density .",
    "the internal energy of the fluid is released on a cooling timescale , @xmath189 .",
    "the presence of an optically thick region in the center of the disk limits the luminosity ( dominated by electron and positron capture onto free nucleons ) to @xmath190erg  s@xmath8 , and the initial internal energy is @xmath191  erg , so @xmath192  s. if @xmath193 , the disk will cool before its mass or internal energy reservoir is significantly affected by accretion onto the black hole . the maximum density ( shown in figure  [ rhomax ] for runs a1 m , a2 m and a3 m ) actually increases slightly due to vertical compression , and subsequently drops once mass loss through accretion dominates ( the @xmath194  ms delay at the start , during which it is approximately constant , is simply the sound crossing time across the optically thick region of the disk ) .",
    "the accretion rate onto the black hole , @xmath195 , the accretion timescale @xmath196 and the total neutrino luminosity @xmath197 are shown in figures  [ mdot ] , [ tacc ] and [ lum ] .",
    "they all show the same qualitative behavior , remaining fairly constant ( or changing slowly ) for an accretion timescale , and abruptly switching thereafter .",
    "the accretion timescales are approximately 0.5  s and 5  s for @xmath198 respectively .    for high viscosity , @xmath136",
    ", the transport of angular momentum is vigorous , and the black hole quickly accretes a substantial amount of mass ( @xmath199 within the first 100  ms ) .",
    "the accretion timescale is @xmath200  ms .",
    "the circulation pattern consists of large ",
    "scale eddies , with @xmath6 .",
    "in fact there is essentially one large eddy on each side of the equatorial plane , with mass inflow along the surface of the disk , and an equatorial outflow .",
    "part of the outflowing gas moves away from the equator and reverses direction close to the surface of the disk , contributing to the inflow . for an intermediate viscosity , @xmath137 , the intensity of the circulations is smaller , but also , the eddies are smaller , with several of them clearly occurring in the disk at once .",
    "the transport of angular momentum being less vigorous , the accretion rate is substantially smaller than in the previous case . finally , for a yet lower viscosity , @xmath201 , the trend continues , and the eddies become smaller still . in these last two cases ,",
    "angular momentum transport is so low that very high densities are maintained in the central regions of the disk for a large number of dynamical times , contrary to what is seen in the high viscosity case .",
    "a simple way to quantify how much of the mass flow is actually making it to the central black hole is to measure the fraction of mass at any given radius that is moving inwards , @xmath202 , where we have divided the mass flow rate into two height  integrated parts , one with @xmath203 and another with @xmath204 .",
    "for example , for run a2 m at @xmath205  ms and @xmath206 it is approximately 1/3 .",
    "the ratio tends to unity only in the innermost regions of the disk , and shows the true black hole mass accretion rate , plotted in figure  [ mdot ] for the same cases .",
    "we now turn our attention to the neutrinos , which are the main source of cooling .",
    "the results in this case are markedly different from what we initially found @xcite , simply because of the new equation of state , the more realistic cooling rates and the approximate computation of opacities .",
    "they are in general agreement with the preliminary results we presented before @xcite , which used a less detailed equation of state than the one shown here .",
    "the optically thick region is present in every disk at the start of the calculation .",
    "as already mentioned , this has two important effects : enhancing the pressure and suppressing the neutrino emission .",
    "this reflects upon the total luminosity , since the suppression occurs precisely in the hottest regions , where most of the energy would otherwise be released .",
    "the most important qualitative difference between the runs presented here is that for a high viscosity ( @xmath136 , runs a1 m and a1 m ) , the disk is drained of mass so fast that it has no chance to cool ( @xmath207 ) and release most of its internal energy .",
    "it is in fact advected into the black hole .",
    "moreover , the optically thick region disappears entirely from the disk ( see figure  [ compa0.01a00.1t100t200 ] ) by @xmath208  ms .",
    "the emission is then no longer suppressed ( see the contours of @xmath124 in the same figure ) , and the disk radiates at the maximum possible cooling rate .",
    "the thermal energy content of the disk is so large , that as it thins , the luminosity actually increases briefly around @xmath209  ms before dropping again .",
    "the drop at late times follows an approximate power law , with @xmath210 . in this interval",
    "the energy release comes from a combination of residual internal energy and viscous dissipation within the disk . for lower values of the viscosity , @xmath211 ,",
    "the central regions of the disk remain optically thick throughout the calculations .",
    "note that reducing the disk mass by a factor of five ( as was done for runs a1 m , a2 m , a3 m ) does not affect these overall conclusions .",
    "the fluid is simply compressed into a smaller volume , and thus the densities and temperatures that are reached are similar than for the high mass runs . for run",
    "a3 m the neutrino luminosity is practically constant at @xmath212  erg  s@xmath8 for @xmath213  ms .",
    "table  [ table : evol ] summarizes the typical disk mass , energy density , accretion rate , luminosity , and duration and energetics of neutrino emission for all runs .",
    "we have performed two - dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of accretion disks in the regime of hypercritical accretion , where neutrino emission is the main cooling agent .",
    "the disks are assumed to be present around a stellar  mass black hole , and are evolved for a few hundred dynamical timescales .",
    "we have paid particular attention to the relevant microphysical processes under the conditions at hand , and used a detailed equation of state which includes an ideal gas of @xmath5 particles and free baryons in nuclear statistical equilibrium and a relativistic fermi gas of arbitrary degeneracy .",
    "the composition of the fluid is determined by weak interactions .",
    "the density and temperature are such that the inner regions of the disk become opaque to neutrinos , and this is taken into account in a simple approximation .",
    "* once the fluid becomes photodisintegrated into free nucleons , neutronization becomes important and lowers the electron fraction substantially below 1/2 , with the electron fraction @xmath28 reaching @xmath214 at its minimum .",
    "this value , however , does not occur in the immediate vicinity of the black hole , but rather at the transition radius where the fluid becomes optically thick to its own neutrino emission , @xmath215  cm . at smaller radii ,",
    "the electron fraction rises again , reaching @xmath216 close to the horizon .",
    "* neutrino trapping produces a change in composition and an inversion in the electron fraction .",
    "the associated negative gradient in @xmath164 induces convective motions in the optically thick region of the disk .",
    "this is analogous to what presumably occurs following core collapse , in a proto  neutron star and its surrounding envelope . due to the radial flows induced by viscosity",
    ", convection is unable to suppress this composition gradient .",
    "it would appear , however , that the entropy per baryon in the optically thick region is very close to being constant , with @xmath217 . *",
    "the spatial structure of the disk is characterized by the transition radius @xmath121 where the material becomes optically thick .",
    "for @xmath117 the disk cools efficiently , whereas for @xmath113 the emission is suppressed and the fluid is unable to cool directly ( although it does so on a neutrino diffusion timescale ) .",
    "this leads to larger pressures and a more moderate rise in density . * the temporal evolution of the disk",
    "is determined by the balance between accretion and neutrino emission . for low viscosities ( @xmath218 ) ,",
    "the disk is able to cool in a quasi steady state and radiate its internal energy reservoir .",
    "this lasts for approximately 0.1 - 0.4  s , with @xmath219  erg  s@xmath8 .",
    "thereafter the typical luminosity and density quickly decay . for large viscosities ( @xmath220 )",
    "the disk is drained of mass on an accretion timescale which is shorter than the cooling timescale , and the internal energy of the disk is essentially advected into the black hole . an interesting result in this case is that as the disk becomes transparent before being engulfed by the hole , it undergoes a re - brightening , as some of the stored energy escapes . * the total energy output in neutrinos is @xmath221  erg , over a timescale of @xmath222  ms .",
    "the typical accretion rates are @xmath223  s@xmath8 , and neutrino energies are @xmath224  mev at @xmath121 .",
    "energy densities in the inner regions of the disk are @xmath225erg  @xmath10 .",
    "there are two main ingredients in the results presented here that contrast with those available previously in the literature concerning the steady state structure of neutrino cooled accretion disks .",
    "the first is the ability to dynamically model the evolution of the system for hundreds of dynamical timescales , taking the previous history of the fluid into consideration through the choice of initial conditions .",
    "this allows us to consider the energetics on more relevant timescales ( cooling , viscous ) than the dynamical one accessible in three dimensional studies .",
    "the second is the realization that the structure of the disks is affected qualitatively by the presence of an optically thick region at high densities . in this sense",
    "the situation is similar to that encountered following massive core collapse , where convection occurs ( recent work assessing the relative importance of the mri , neutrino and convection driven viscosity in rotating collapsing cores has been reported by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* we comment further on this issue in  [ magnetic ] ) .",
    "clearly there is room for improvement in the results presented here . to begin with ,",
    "our expressions for the effect of a finite optical depth on cooling and pressure are too simple , and attempt only to capture the essential physical behavior of the system .",
    "there is an important region of the disk where the optical depth is not large enough to consider the diffusion approximation , and where more detailed transport effects ought to be considered .",
    "we have not separated the neutrino variables into three species , which would be more rigorous ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* have noted that in such flows , the electron neutrinos @xmath226 might be preferentially absorbed with respect to electron anti ",
    "neutrinos @xmath227 , thus affecting the neutrino annihilation luminosity above the surface of the disk in an important way ) .",
    "we have only considered the effects of coherent scattering off nucleons and @xmath5 particles for opacity purposes .",
    "this specifically ignores absorptive scattering , which would : ( i ) lead to a modification of the neutrino emergent spectrum ; ( ii ) produce heating of the fluid",
    ". the latter may be particularly important concerning the driving of powerful winds off the surface of the disk , and needs to be addressed more carefully in the context of grbs . as in previous work , we have chosen to maintain the newtonian expression for the potential well of the central black hole for ease of comparison to previous results ( this will be addressed in future work ) .",
    "the sudden release of gravitational binding energy of a neutron star is easily sufficient to power a grb .",
    "the minimum energy requirement is @xmath228 erg if the burst is beamed into a solid angle @xmath229 . as discussed in ",
    "[ intro ] , a familiar possibility , especially for bursts belonging to the short duration category , is the merger of a neutron star - black hole , or double neutron star binary by emission of gravity waves , which , as illustrated here , is likely to generate a black hole surrounded by a lower mass accretion disk .",
    "how is the available rotational and gravitational energy converted into an outflowing relativistic plasma ?",
    "a straightforward way is that some of the energy released as thermal neutrinos is reconverted , via collisions outside the disk , into electron - positron pairs or photons .",
    "the neutrino luminosity emitted when disk material accretes via viscous ( or magnetic ) torques on a timescale @xmath230 s is roughly @xmath231 for a canonical radiation efficiency of 0.1 . during this time , the rate of mass supply to the central black hole is of course much greater than the eddington rate .",
    "although the gas photon opacities are large , the disk becomes sufficiently dense and hot to cool via neutrino emission .",
    "there is in principle no difficulty in dissipating the disk internal energy , but the problem is in allowing these neutrinos to escape from the inflowing gas . at sufficiently low accretion rates , @xmath232",
    ", we find that the energy released by viscous dissipation is almost completely radiated away on a timescale given by @xmath233  s. in contrast , for a higher mass supply , @xmath234 , energy advection remains important until the entire disk becomes optically thin .",
    "the restriction on the cooling rate imposed by high optical depths is key because it allows the energy loss to be spread over an extended period of time during which the neutrino luminosity stays roughly constant .",
    "this gives a characteristic timescale for energy extraction and may be essential for determining the duration of neutrino - driven short grbs @xcite .",
    "neutrinos could give rise to a relativistic pair - dominated wind if they converted into pairs in a region of low baryon density ( e.g. along the rotation axis , away from the equatorial plane of the disk ) .",
    "the @xmath235 process can tap the thermal energy of the torus produced by viscous dissipation .",
    "for this mechanism to be efficient , the neutrinos must escape before being advected into the hole ; on the other hand , the efficiency of conversion into pairs ( which scales with the square of the neutrino density ) is low if the neutrino production is too gradual .",
    "typical estimates suggest a lower bound of @xmath236 ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "if the pair - dominated plasma were collimated into a solid angle @xmath229 then of course the apparent isotropized energy would be larger by a factor @xmath237 , but unless @xmath229 is @xmath238 this may fail to satisfy the apparent isotropized energy of @xmath13 ergs implied by a redshift @xmath239 for short grbs .",
    "one attractive mechanism for extracting energy that could circumvent the above efficiency problem is a relativistic magneto hydrodynamic ( mhd ) wind @xcite .",
    "such a wind carries both bulk kinetic energy and ordered poynting flux , and it possible that gamma - ray production occurs mainly at large distances from the source @xcite . a rapidly rotating neutron star ( or disk ) releases energy via magnetic torques at the rate @xmath240 , where @xmath241 s is the spin period , and @xmath242 g is the strength of the poloidal field at a radius @xmath243 cm .",
    "the last stable orbit for a schwarzschild hole lies at a coordinate distance @xmath244 km , to be compared with @xmath245 km for an extremal kerr hole .",
    "thus the massive neutron disk surrounding a schwarzschild black hole of approximately @xmath246 should emit a spin - down luminosity comparable to that emitted by a millisecond neutron star .",
    "a similar mhd outflow would result if angular momentum were extracted from a central kerr hole via electromagnetic torques @xcite .",
    "the field required to produce @xmath247 is colossal , and may be provided by a helical dynamo operating in hot , convective nuclear matter with a millisecond period @xcite .",
    "a dipole field of the order of @xmath248 g appears weak compared to the strongest field that can in principle be generated by differential rotation ( @xmath249^{-1}\\;{\\rm g}$ ] ) , or by convection ( @xmath250 ) , although how this may come about in detail is not resolved .",
    "we examine in more detail the possible generation of strong magnetic fields below in  [ magnetic ] .",
    "computer simulations of compact object mergers and black hole formation can address the fate of the bulk of the matter , but there are some key questions that they can not yet tackle . in particular , high resolution of the outer layers is required because even a tiny mass fraction of baryons loading down the outflow severely limits the attainable lorentz factor - for instance a poynting flux of @xmath251 erg could not accelerate an outflow to @xmath252 if it had to drag more than @xmath253 solar masses of baryons with it .",
    "one further effect renders the computational task of simulating jet formation even more challenging .",
    "this stems from the likelihood that the high neutrino fluxes ablate baryonic material from the surface of the disk at a rate @xcite @xmath254 a rest mass flux @xmath255 limits the bulk lorentz factor of the wind to @xmath256 if one assumes that the external poloidal field strength is limited by the vigor of the convective motions , then the spin - down luminosity scales with neutrino flux as @xmath257 , where @xmath258 is the convective velocity .",
    "the ablation rate given in equation ( [ ablation ] ) then indicates that the limiting bulk lorentz factor @xmath259 of the wind decreases as @xmath260 .",
    "thus the burst luminosity emitted by a magnetized neutrino cooled disk may be self - limiting . the mass loss would , however , be suppressed if the relativistic wind were collimated into a jet .",
    "this suggests that centrifugally driven mass loss will be heaviest in the outer parts of the disk , and that a detectable burst may be emitted only within a certain solid angle centered on the rotation axis ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "there is also the question of magnetic fields , which we have not included , but should obviously be considered .",
    "the field in a standard disk is probably responsible for viscous stresses and dissipation , through the mri . in this respect",
    "the current scenario should exhibit these characteristics .",
    "the mri operates on an orbital timescale , and so the field would grow in a few tens of milliseconds .",
    "it may also be amplified by the convective motions described above , ",
    "[ nuconvection ] . the saturation value for the field can be naively estimated as that at which its energy density is in equipartition with the gas , @xmath261 , or when the alfven speed , @xmath262 is comparable with the azimuthal velocity , @xmath263 .",
    "this gives @xmath264  g. it is not clear at all , however , that the field amplitude will reach such high levels , because the magnetic reynolds number is far beyond its critical value ( where diffusion balances dynamo  driven growth ) , and amplification can lead to field expulsion from the convective region , thereby destroying the dynamo @xcite .",
    "precious little is known about the growth of magnetic fields at such overcritical levels @xcite , and a definitive answer will require the self  consistent inclusion of full mhd into the problem at hand ( but with a level of resolution which may be well above present computational capabilities ) . it is not clear either that the magnetic shearing instability can generate a mean poloidal field as strong as @xmath265  g , since to first order it does not amplify the total magnetic flux .",
    "the non - linear evolution of the instability depends sensitively on details of magnetic reconnection , and it has indeed been suggested that this can smooth reversals in the field on very small scales , pushing the dominant growing mode to much larger scales @xcite .",
    "it is certainly possible , as shown here , that compact binary mergers do form a neutron disk that is hot enough to be optically thick to neutrinos , and convective instability is a direct consequence of the hot nuclear equation of state .",
    "a neutron disk is likely to be convective if the accretion luminosity exceeds @xmath266 .",
    "note that even if the accretion luminosity is lower , a hot , massive disk ( such as those forming in collapsars , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) would undergo a brief period of convection as a result of secular cooling ( notice that convection is driven by secular neutrino cooling , whereas the mri is powered by a release of shear kinetic energy ) . if the dense matter rotates roughly at the local keplerian angular velocity , @xmath267",
    ", then @xmath268 is approximately independent of radius , and the required poloidal field for a given luminosity is @xmath269 .",
    "if a period of convection is a necessary step in the formation of a strong , large - scale poloidal field , an acceptable model thus requires that the surrounding torus should not completely drain into the hole on too short of a timescale . whether a torus of given mass survives clearly depends on its thickness and stratification , which in turn depends on internal viscous dissipation and neutrino cooling .    a large amount of differential rotation ( as may occur in newborn neutron stars or those in x  ray binaries , and is definitely the case in toroidal structures supported mainly by centrifugal forces ) , combined with short periods , may produce substantial magnetic field amplification @xcite .",
    "the energy transferred to the magnetic field is released in episodic outbursts when the buoyancy force allows the field to rise to the surface of the star or disk .",
    "the amplification of a magnetic field to such strong values would clearly have important consequences on the evolution and time variability of the disk and its energy output .",
    "it would probably lead to strong flaring and reconnection events accompanied by the release of large amounts of energy , if the growth time for field amplification , @xmath270 , is shorter than the accretion timescale , @xmath188 ( otherwise the disk would drain of matter before the field had the chance to reach large values ; in this case , the survival of a massive , rapidly rotating neutron star as the end - point of binary ns merger might be preferred over the prompt formation of a bh )",
    ". an effective helical dynamo of the @xmath271 type should be favored by a low effective viscosity , @xmath5 , because , as stated in ",
    "[ nuconvection ] , the overturn time ms . ] is @xmath272ms ( this applies only if the disk is not fed with matter externally for a time longer than @xmath188 , otherwise convection would also be able to amplify the magnetic field ) .",

    "initial investigations into this matter @xcite determined that the entropy in the outflow arising from a newborn neutron star was probably too low to give rise to the r  process efficiently .",
    "more recently , this problem has been addressed again in the specific case of collapsar or post  merger accretion disks , based on the results of analytical calculations of neutrino cooled disks in one dimension @xcite .",
    "if the wind consists of a uniform outflow driven from the surface of the disk , the entropy is too low , and essentially only iron  group elements are synthesized , in agreement with the earlier results .",
    "however , their results also indicate that in a bubble - type outflow ( against a background steady wind ) , where episodic expulsion of material from the inner regions takes place , material may be ejected from the disk and preserve its low electron fraction , thus allowing the r - process to occur . the convective motions reported here , occurring in the optically thick portion of the disk , would represent one way such cells",
    "could be transported to the disk surface if they can move fast enough to preserve the neutron excess . since the existence of a convection region is dependent upon the densities reached in the inner disk ( so that it becomes opaque ) , the synthesized nuclei ( iron group vs. heavier , r ",

    "<S> this transition produces an inversion of the lepton gradient in the innermost regions of the flow which drives convective motions , and affects the density and disk scale height radial profiles . </S>",
    "<S> the electron fraction remains low in the region close to the black hole , and if preserved in an outflow , could give rise to heavy element nucleosynthesis . </S>",
