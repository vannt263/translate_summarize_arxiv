    "unique properties of photoinduced electronic processes in semiconductor nanoparticles ( sn ) , as compared to bulk semiconductors , is what makes sns ( e.g. , quantum dots , nanorods ) so promising in the multitude of applications including photovoltaics , photonics , lasing and light - emitting devices @xcite . as follows from the term `` photoinduced '' ,",
    "such processes are all initiated by an optical absorption of a photon ( or multiple photons ) resulting in electronic transitions within a sn .",
    "the efficiency of initiation of such processes is thus directly determined by the strength of interaction between external electromagnetic fields ( emf ) and sn electronic transitions .",
    "the same interaction does often further affect the electronic dynamics of initially photoexcited charge carriers .",
    "for example , the electron - emf coupling determines the rate of frster resonance energy transfer between nearby sns .",
    "photon absorption , as well as spontaneous and stimulated photon emissions , are main processes determining the efficiency of lasing . finally , the lifetime of a charge carrier is affected by the electron - emf coupling via the radiative recombination rate .",
    "this is especially true for high - quality sns where the quantum yield of photoluminescence can approach 100% , implying that the observable lifetime of charge carriers approaches the inverse radiative recombination rate @xcite .",
    "the strength of coupling between electronic transitions in sns and emf is often expressed via the so called kane momentum matrix element or simply kane momentum , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are bulk bloch functions corresponding to conduction and valence band edges , respectively @xcite .",
    "for example , approximating an sn as a simple two - level quantum emitter in vacuum results in the following expression for the rate of radiative recombination ( in gaussian units ) @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the magnitude of the charge and the mass of free electron , respectively .",
    "speed of light in vacuum and planck constant are denoted by @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "energy of the lowest electronic transition , @xmath11 , could be significantly larger than the bandgap energy of the corresponding bulk semiconductor , @xmath12 , due to quantum confinement effects in sns .",
    "cross sections of absorption and stimulated emission are linearly related to @xmath13 via einstein coefficients @xcite , and so are also proportional to @xmath14 . for simplicity , we disregard the effect of dielectric screening within the sn and the surrounding material ( e.g. , solvent ) on the electron - emf coupling .",

    "the operator of potential energy , @xmath39 , is periodic over the semiconductor lattice and can , in general , have contributions linear in momentum @xmath40 due to spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the direct evaluation of the radiative recombination rate from the microscopic hamiltonian is somewhat tedious since it requires quantization of emf .",
    "optical absorption is simper to assess as the emf can be treated classically . therefore ,",
    "in this paper we focus on the strength of coupling of electronic transitions to the classical emf with the understanding that renormalized @xmath29 , obtained from such analysis , is exactly the same @xmath29 that enters eq .",
    "( [ eq : kr_p ] ) , by virtue of einstein coefficients @xcite .    interaction with a time - dependent classical emf is introduced into eq .",
    "( [ eq : micham ] ) via the so called minimal - coupling procedure : ( i ) the momentum operator is `` elongated '' by the vector potential , @xmath41 , and ( ii ) the scalar potential @xmath42 is added , so that the resulting hamiltonian is ( in gaussian units ) @xcite @xmath43 the gauge transformation of the vector and scalar potentials is given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is an arbitrary real scalar field .",
    "it is straightforward to demonstrate that if an arbitrary wavefunction @xmath46 is the solution of the time - dependent schrdinger equation with hamiltonian ( [ eq : hem ] ) , then @xmath47 is the solution of the schrdinger equation with the same hamiltonian where the vector and scalar potentials are transformed according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : gauge_trans ] ) .",
    "therefore , the gauge transformation of the vector and scalar potentials is exactly equivalent to a certain unitary transformation of the wavefunction , which obviously does not affect any measurable quantities , e.g. , charge density @xmath48 or rates of photoinduced transitions between the states .",
    "the dynamics of the system , encoded by hamiltonian ( [ eq : hem ] ) , is thus _",
    "gauge invariant_. in what follows , we will loosely refer to hamiltonians of the type given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : hem ] ) as gauge invariant , even though , strictly speaking , the hamiltonian operator does not transform into itself upon substitution ( [ eq : gauge_trans ] ) .",
    "although physical observables are gauge invariant , certain calculations could be simplified by an appropriate choice of gauge .",
    "two specific gauge choices are of particular convenience when describing the interaction of sns with emf . starting from an arbitrary gauge it is always possible to choose @xmath49 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gauge_trans ] ) so that the scalar potential vanishes exactly upon the gauge transformation , resulting in @xmath50 where it is assumed that the electronic transitions in sn are driven by the oscillatory emf of angular frequency @xmath51 . the constant vector amplitude of the emf vector potential is @xmath52 .",
    "the dependence of the vector potential on @xmath37 is neglected as it is typically very weak for , e.g. , electromagnetic waves of relevant frequencies . for the free electromagnetic wave , the gauge ( [ eq : gauge1 ] ) coincides with the coulomb ( transverse ) gauge .",
    "if emf is weak , we can expand the microscopic hamiltonian ( [ eq : hem ] ) with respect to the vector potential and retain only up to linear terms .",
    "if we further neglect the spin - orbit interaction , the resulting electron - emf coupling operator is proportional to @xmath53 .",
    "since momentum @xmath40 is related to velocity , gauge  ( [ eq : gauge1 ] ) is often called the _ velocity _ gauge .",

    "( [ eq : gauge1 ] ) by performing the gauge transformation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : gauge_trans ] ) , with @xmath54 .",
    "this produces @xmath55 substituting this expression into eq .",
    "( [ eq : hem ] ) one can see that the electron - emf coupling operator is linearly proportional to @xmath37 .",
    "hence , gauge ( [ eq : gauge2 ] ) is often referred to as the _ length _ gauge .",
    "the convenience of the two gauge choices , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : gauge1 ] ) and ( [ eq : gauge2 ] ) , stems from the fact that electronic transitions in sns are coupled to emf solely through either vector or scalar potential for the velocity and length gauge , respectively .",
    "it has to be emphasized here , however , that we are able to make the vector potential vanish in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gauge2 ] ) only because we neglected its coordinate dependence in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gauge1 ] ) .",
    "more generally , one can make a vector potential vanish only locally in space by choosing a gauge .",
    "the gauge invariance is absolutely necessary for the accurate and consistent treatment of interaction of charge carriers with emf .",
    "for example , neglecting the vector potential in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hem ] ) , and thus breaking gauge invariance , can result in unphysical gauge - dependent rates of photoinduced transitions , which could be made as large as desired by a choice of gauge .",
    "an example of such behavior is provided in sec  [ sub : velocity_gauge ] .",
    "to analyze the electronic structure of sns , it is convenient to not directly use hamiltonian ( [ eq : micham ] ) , but to transform it first to the envelope function representation @xcite . to this end , we find the eigenfunctions @xmath56 of the bulk hamiltonian ( [ eq : micham ] ) at a specific ( typically high symmetry ) point @xmath57 of the brillouin zone @xmath58 here , index @xmath59 enumerates electronic bands , and bloch functions @xmath60 are periodic over the lattice .",
    "these eigenfunctions can now be used to expand an arbitrary time - dependent wavefunction @xmath46 as @xmath61 where @xmath62 are the so called envelope functions that are assumed to vary slowly over the size of a single unit cell . since the basis functions @xmath56 are time - independent",

    "these operators act only within the space of envelope functions , so that a time - dependent schrdinger equation for the wavefunction in eq .",
    "( [ eq : psi_micr ] ) can now be expressed as @xmath65 the obtained hamiltonian @xmath66 is still not quite suitable for practical calculations since the summation over @xmath8 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : kp_inf ] ) runs over an infinite number of electronic bands .",
    "the number of bands can be reduced to a finite number of _ relevant _ ones by means of an approximate canonical transformation that decouples the so called far - bands from the experimentally relevant ones ( e.g. , highest valence and lowest conduction bands ) within the second - order perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "the resulting schrdinger equation is symbolically the same as the one in eq .",
    "( [ eq : kp_inf ] ) , but the summation is now restricted to few bands .",
    "the canonical transformation , typically restricted to the second - order perturbation theory , does not introduce any higher powers of the momentum operator , so the components of resulting few - band matrix hamiltonian are still at most quadratic with respect to @xmath40 .    within the envelope function formalism , the interaction of emf with charge carriers could be dealt with using two different approaches .",
    "the first approach is to use the envelope functions , obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : kp_inf ] ) , to restore the entire microscopic wavefunction ( [ eq : psi_micr ] ) .",
    "coupling between such wavefunctions due to emf could then be evaluated using the microscopic hamiltonian ( [ eq : hem ] ) .",
    "the problem with this approach is that the canonical transformation , used to decouple far - bands , also transforms the basis ( [ eq : bwf_basis ] ) , so that the new basis functions are linear combinations of the old ones with , in general , time- and coordinate - dependent coefficients . under these conditions ,",
    "the restoration of the microscopic wavefunction is a tedious task that has to be performed very accurately to preserve the gauge invariance of the problem .",
    "the other , perhaps more physically transparent approach , is to include the interaction with the vector and scalar potentials directly into the envelope function hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( [ eq : henv ] ) .",
    "this can always be done directly by starting from the microscopic hamiltonian ( [ eq : hem ] ) , and then averaging it over the unit cell and performing the canonical transformation to reduce the number of bands @xcite .",
    "the result , however , can be guessed because the final result - @xmath28 hamiltonian with external fields - must be gauge - invariant in the sense introduced in sec .  [ sec : mic_ham ] .",
    "more specifically , since the gauge transformation of the scalar and vector potentials is identical to unitary transformation of a time - dependent wave function , one can conclude that the external emf has to be introduced into @xmath66 as @xmath67 the result is of course very similar to how it was done in the case of the microscopic hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( [ eq : hem ] ) , since the minimal - coupling procedure is a natural gauge - invariant way to introduce vector and scalar potentials into a generic hamiltonian .",
    "we wish to emphasize here that once the emf is introduced into @xmath64 , one does not need to restore the microscopic wavefunctions to perform calculations in the presence of emf , since the dynamics of charge carriers in the presence of emf is fully encoded by the just obtained envelope function hamiltonian ( [ eq : subst_em ] ) .",
    "for example , rates of photoinduced transitions between electronic states could be obtained by treating terms containing @xmath68 and @xmath42 in @xmath69 as a perturbation . more specifically , since components of hamiltonian @xmath64 are at most quadratic with respect to @xmath40 , the lowest order operator of interaction with emf can be obtained from eq .",

    "however , since the hamiltonian is gauge invariant , all physical observables are exactly gauge independent at emf of arbitrary strength , and , therefore , for each order of field strength independently .",
    "the leading order terms of expansion of time - resolved state populations with respect to the emf strength do thus produce gauge invariant transition rates .",
    "in this section we will explore the general features of how mixing between electronic bands affects the strength of the electron - emf interaction .",

    "however , what is not immediately clear at the first glance is that the considered approach is also not gauge - invariant . as discussed in sec .",

    "the effect could be seen most transparently in the continuous kane model , i.e. , where no size quantization was present . on a very qualitative approximate level",
    ", one can think that both ( i ) band mixing terms of the envelope function hamiltonian and ( ii ) the external emf do perform the same function - they couple electronic states from different bands ( e.g. , valence and conduction ) .",
    "then , when band mixing terms are weak , e.g. , when energies are very close to band edges , emf mixes bands most efficiently resulting in the strong electron - emf coupling",
    ". on the other hand , when the effect of mode mixing terms is significant ( i.e. , higher energies ) , the conduction and valence states become strongly mixed within the envelope function formalism . under these conditions ,",
    "the external emf can not mix such states any further since they are already strongly mixed into symmetric and antisymmetric linear combinations of conduction and valence band states .",
    "this results in a diminished strength of the electron - emf coupling .",
    "the picture becomes much more involved once the spatial quantization is present , since a single state from a band can now couple to multiple states within the other band .",
    "nevertheless , the introduced qualitative picture holds if we substitute energies of the continuous electronic states with discrete quantum confinement energies in sns . specifically , the electron - emf coupling is strongest in large sns , which corresponds to small confinement energies , and becomes weaker in smaller sns where confinement energies become larger .",
    "it turns out that even though the phenomenon of renormalization of electron - emf interaction by band mixing could be rather involved physically , it can nevertheless be quantified by a single energy - dependent function - an effective energy - dependent kane momentum , @xmath29 .",
    "such a function in general depends on the material parameters ( e.g. , bulk band gap , effective masses ) and on the sn shape .",
    "[ fig : p_e ] shows our numerical results for the effective energy - dependent kane momenta for @xmath0 and @xmath1 spherically symmetric sns ( i.e. , quantum dots ) .",

    "indeed , completely discarding the diagonal part yields a hamiltonian matrix which is linear with respect to the momentum operator .",
    "for such a hamiltonian , there is only a single linearly independent bulk solution per specific parity , which is not enough to satisfy the boundary conditions . in eq .",

    "specifically , size - quantized levels in a quantum dot ( qd ) are found by requiring the wavefunction to be non - singular inside the qd and to vanish at the qd surface , @xmath171 , where @xmath172 is the qd radius .",
    "the standard procedure of finding size - quantized levels via matching the boundary conditions is as follows @xcite .",
    "first , all the linearly independent eigenfunctions of hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham_kw ] ) of specific energy and symmetry are found .",

    "parity @xmath300 where @xmath188 is a coordinate inversion operator ( @xmath301 ) .",
    "the global sign of the operator is chosen to represent the parity of the total microscopic wavefunction , since the conduction band bloch function is odd , and the valence band bloch function is even @xcite .",
    "it is clear , however , that as long as @xmath28 hamiltonian is specified , parity is its internal property and the original parity of the bloch functions are irrelevant .",
    "for example , even if a certain material does not have any inversion symmetry , but a corresponding effective hamiltonian could be written as eq .",

    "it is thus expected that the radial part of operator @xmath320 has to be a raising or lowering operator for the spherical bessel functions .",
    "indeed , if one combines @xmath309 and @xmath310 into a single quantum number @xmath324 for @xmath325 , then spherical spinors can be written as @xmath326 and one has @xcite @xmath327 the radial operator in parentheses becomes @xmath328 for positive @xmath329 ( @xmath330 ) and @xmath331 for negative @xmath329 ( @xmath332 ) , where the raising and lowering operators for the spherical bessel functions are defined as @xmath333 eqs .",

    "<S> unique optical properties of semiconductor nanoparticles ( sn ) make them very promising in the multitude of applications including lasing , light emission and photovoltaics . in many of these applications </S>",

    "<S> this strength is often assumed to be fully encoded by the so called kane momentum matrix element . </S>",
    "<S> this parameter , however , pertains to a bulk semiconductor material and , as such , is not sensitive to the quantum confinement effects in sns . in this work </S>",
