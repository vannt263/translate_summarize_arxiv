    "a topological section of finite length @xmath3 , the mfs at each end with localization length @xmath4 depending on @xmath1 can overlap , leading to splitting of the zbp at strong @xmath1-fields .    the experiments  @xcite show features which are _ partially _ consistent with the existence of mfs .",
    "however , _ quantitative _ agreement with the theory is still missing , and in particular the following points have to be clarified :    ( i )  the most evident discrepancy between experiment and theory is the absence of any experimental signature of the excitation gap in the nanowire .",
    "recently , this fact has been ascribed to the spatial distribution of the wave functions for low chemical potential @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "( ii )  the zbp in the experiments appears above a certain magnetic field , persists over a finite range of @xmath1 , and then disappears , rather than splitting as expected for mfs .",

    "our setup aims exactly at taking this fact into account : the proximity effect is included in an effective fashion ( not microscopically ) , but we do have two different pairing regions that electrons have to cross . still , with the sequential geometry of fig .",
    "[ fig : schematicn - nw - sw - s ] we are slightly simplifying here the experimental setup  @xcite , where the nanowire is side - contacted , or top - contacted , and the current does not follow a straight path .",
    "+ first we note that the value of the soi @xmath68 in the experiments is not known , as also noticed in ref .  , since the only available measurements have been performed in a different setup , where the soi was likely modified . similarly , the proximity pairing amplitude is not directly accessible , and one can only deduce it from the @xmath8 behavior .",
    "thus , it becomes interesting and even necessary to consider regimes with different soi strengths , or different proximity pairing amplitudes .",
    "the first important point we want to make is that by assuming that the actual soi is larger than the reported one ( e.g. , @xmath61  ev@xmath62 , or @xmath69ev in ref .  )",
    ", one can get a substantial improvement in the calculated @xmath8 behavior , with features more similar to experiments  @xcite .",

    "the disorder lowers or destroys the gap relative to lower subbands , bringing many supra - gap states down , close to the fermi level , where they cluster in some cases into a finite - extension zbp , like in panel ( a ) .",
    "such clustering is , however , removed for stronger soi  @xcite , see panel ( b ) . ]",
    "\\(1 ) under the assumption that the measured zbp  @xcite arises from mfs , we conclude that @xmath43 in the topological section , since the zbp emerges already at small @xmath1 , @xmath73 for @xmath44 .",
    "however , such a small @xmath5 , together with the reported soi values  @xcite , would generate a rapid closing of the @xmath64-gap @xmath74 as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "this is indeed what we find in our transport calculations for @xmath43 , @xmath61 ev@xmath62 , both in the ns and nss@xmath10 setup , see figs .",
    "[ fig : slow_closing_gap](a ) and [ fig : slow_closing_gap](c ) , respectively .",
    "note that in the ns case the zbp stays at zero for all fields , whereas in the nss@xmath10 case the zbp exhibits an oscillating splitting ( see below ) . in the same figure",

    "note that this latter soi effect , which answers the issue raised in point ( iv ) above , is independent of the nature of the observed zbp .",
    "as already observed elsewhere  @xcite , the considered regime of @xmath43 is characterized by an invisible gap closing , probably due to pretransition wave functions which are delocalized throughout the wire , with little weight close to the probed edges . at finite temperature",

    "the oscillations become visible at higher magnetic field ( @xmath77 increases ) , and with large enough soi strength the gap closing becomes partially visible , even for the considered case of @xmath43 , while it is not visible in an ns setup with the same parameters .",
    "the @xmath8 peaks coming from the gap - closing have , however , very small width and they get washed out by realistic temperatures . ]    \\(2 ) when realistic anderson disorder is included in the model , the closing of the gap becomes visible again even in the @xmath43 regime  @xcite , reintroducing a discrepancy with experiments  @xcite .",
    "disorder in a nanowire with _",
    "weak _ soi causes a number of subgap states to appear , some of which cluster around zero energy and possibly give rise to a nontopological zbp , more markedly for finite @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "such states are coming from other subbands , for which the effective minigap gets reduced in the presence of disorder .",
    "this is substantiated by the fact that the zbp in fig .",
    "[ fig : weakso_disorder](a ) has a conductance peak larger than @xmath6 , implying that it can not come from the andreev signal of a single band . for stronger soi ,",
    "the effect of disorder gets suppressed , and fewer subgap states are observed ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : weakso_disorder ] ) , more compatibly with the experimental evidence  @xcite . due to the same mechanism , also the strong zbp feature of fig .",
    "[ fig : weakso_disorder](a ) disappears , though .",
    "thus , disorder is unlikely to explain the zbp structure observed in experiments .",
    "on magnetic field @xmath1 . according to the theory for a one - band semi - infinite nanowire @xcite , a mf emerges when the magnetic field exceeds a critical value @xmath78 , and the system goes from the nontopological ( gray ) to the topological ( yellow ) regime .",
    "however , for a nanowire of finite length @xmath3 , due to overlap of the mfs from each end , the additional approximate condition for the observation of a mf is @xmath79 .",
    "considering typical dependences of @xmath4 on magnetic field  @xcite , we predict that the mf should be observed for @xmath80 , where the critical fields @xmath81 and @xmath77 are defined through @xmath82 ( cf .",

    "note the evolution of the proximity peak towards lower energies and the appearance of a second peak at the largest values of @xmath88 [ panel ( d ) ] . ]",
    "\\(3 ) as a consequence of the finite length of the topological section ( @xmath3 ) and of the @xmath1 dependence of @xmath64 , we observe that the zbp splitting exhibits oscillations of increasing amplitude as @xmath1 is swept , see fig .",
    "[ fig : closing_visible](a )  @xcite . to explain this",
    ", we recall that in the weak - soi limit the mf wave function has an exponentially decaying envelope with localization length @xmath4 and a fast - oscillating part @xmath89  @xcite . if the magnetic field exceeds a critical value @xmath90 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : localization1 ] ) , the two end - mfs overlap and split away from zero energy .",
    "since @xmath4 increases with @xmath1  @xcite , so does the splitting .",
    "however , if @xmath91 becomes an integer multiple of @xmath92 as a function of @xmath1 , the zbp splitting returns to zero , leading to oscillations with a period given by @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the band mass and @xmath19 the lattice constant . using parameter values corresponding to fig .",
    "[ fig : closing_visible ] , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , we obtain quantitative agreement with the simulated zbp oscillations .",
    "since the critical field @xmath77 increases with soi  @xcite , the zbp splitting and related oscillations occur at larger fields . in other words ,",
    "the presence or absence of the oscillations in a given range of magnetic field values is determined by the strength @xmath68 of the soi and by the ratio @xmath97 .",
    "the former fixes the form of the mf wave function , the latter determines whether the two mf bound states are overlapping in a significant way or not .",
    "this explains why in fig .",
    "[ fig : closing_visible](b ) , where strong soi has been adopted , oscillations are starting at higher @xmath1 ( barely visible ) .",
    "note that these oscillations are quite robust against temperature effects , see fig .",
    "[ fig : slow_closing_gap](c ) .",
    "such behavior of the zbp is quite remarkable and provides an additional possible signature to identify mfs experimentally . to make contact with issue ( ii ) raised in sec .",
    "[ sec : introduction ] , one can argue at this point that the absence of oscillations in the experimentally observed zbps  @xcite represents an additional hint for strong soi .",
    "we note in passing that in the nss@xmath10 setup the soi affects the visibility of the gap closing , see fig .",
    "[ fig : closing_visible ] .",
    "again , one can explain this behavior by invoking the changing spatial profile of the wave functions close to the wire edge for different soi values , together with the finite length of the wire .",
    "the same effect is not manifested in the case of the ns setup ( infinite wire length ) . +    .",
    "the parameters are chosen as in the previous figures , different curves refer to different magnetic field values , ranging from 0 to @xmath98mev ( @xmath99 t for @xmath44 ) , in steps of 0.2@xmath7 .",

    "the closing of the gap is , however , nearly absent .",
    "b ) same system , but with @xmath102 nm , a value closer to the experimental situation .",
    "gap - closing and zbp are completely absent ( the adopted energy resolution @xmath103 is much smaller than the realistic @xmath104 ) . ]",
    "next we address further issues that have received less attention in the literature so far .",
    "\\(4 ) the position of the proximity gap @xmath105 as observed in the @xmath8 curves is in general different from @xmath7 inserted in the hamiltonian , eq .  ( [ h ] ) .",
    "this observation is important , since it means that deducing the proximity gap from the conductance curves is not a correct procedure  @xcite .",
    "such an energy shift can be due to the presence of a normal section of finite length @xmath88 between tunnel barrier and ns interface .",
    "more precisely , the observed peak moves to _ lower _ bias voltages for larger @xmath88 . by increasing @xmath88 , one can move the conductance peak deeper inside the gap and eventually even introduce additional peaks when @xmath106 , similarly to the case of mcmillan - rowell resonances  @xcite .",
    "this behavior is summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : l_n ] .",
    "alternatively , in the nss@xmath10 configuration the peak corresponding to @xmath7 itself can be viewed as a subgap resonance of the larger gap @xmath40 , and its position can be changed by varying the distance @xmath3 of the n - s interface from the s - s@xmath10 interface . in this case , the peak moves to @xmath107 energies for decreasing @xmath3 , see , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig : slow_closing_gap](c ) and [ fig : slow_closing_gap](d ) , and fig .",
    "[ fig : closing_visible ] , where the @xmath8 peak is above @xmath7 due to the finite wire length [ compare with figs .",
    "[ fig : slow_closing_gap](a ) and [ fig : slow_closing_gap](b ) ] .",
    "\\(5 ) in both ns and nss@xmath10 configurations , the tunnel barrier plays an important role  it determines the transmission of each transport channel , which in turn sets the width of the subgap resonances  @xcite ( without changing their height ) .",
    "introduction of temperature smears the resonances while preserving their weight , which implies a reduction of the height in correspondence to the barrier - induced reduction of the width .",
    "this explains the very small value of the zbp in experiments , and answers to issue ( iii ) .",
    "if the resonance width becomes smaller than the temperature , the resonance is essentially invisible  @xcite .",
    "consequently , if the barrier is wide enough , no subgap features are present in the @xmath8 curve .",
    "if the tunnel barrier is chosen to be sharp ( like in many analytical and numerical calculations ) , all the states present in the nanowire could become visible .",
    "however , that is not a realistic choice , since a typical barrier in experiments has a characteristic width of @xmath108 nm . for such values we already observe a momentum filtering  @xcite , leading in some cases to a complete disappearance of mf signatures , see fig .",
    "[ fig : tunnel_barrier ] . again , introducing disorder can make the aforementioned subgap features reappear .",
    "therefore , it is the combined effect of barrier shape , soi , and disorder strength that determines the final visibility of mfs .",
    "in summary , by numerically simulating a more realistic setup than before , we have obtained new features in the transport that are similar to the ones observed in experiments . however , even after considerable effort , we do not reproduce all such features in a single configuration , and we still lack a satisfactory agreement with experiments . in particular , the exact shape of the measured zbp is not very compatible with the picture of mfs that form and then split as a function of magnetic field . thus ,",
    "either the theoretical model is still incomplete , or a different physical origin for the observed zbp  @xcite is to be considered .",
    "more precisely , from our findings it seems possible that in the experiments the mf features are essentially invisible and the observed zbp is coming from some different coexisting phenomenon , like kondo effect , which seems indeed to yield a similar behavior in some situations  @xcite .",

    "<S> motivated by recent experiments searching for majorana fermions ( mfs ) in hybrid semiconducting - superconducting nanostructures , we consider a realistic tight - binding model and analyze its transport behavior numerically . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we take into account the presence of a superconducting contact , used in real experiments to extract the current , which is usually not included in theoretical calculations . </S>",
    "<S> we show that important features emerge that are absent in simpler models , such as the shift in energy of the proximity gap signal , and the enhanced visibility of the topological gap for increased spin - orbit interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we find oscillations of the zero bias peak as a function of the magnetic field and study them analytically . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that many of the experimentally observed features hint at an actual spin - orbit interaction larger than the one typically assumed . </S>",
    "<S> however , even taking into account all the known ingredients of the experiments and exploring many parameter regimes for mfs , we are not able to reach full agreement with the reported data . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a different physical origin for the observed zero - bias peak can not be excluded . </S>"
