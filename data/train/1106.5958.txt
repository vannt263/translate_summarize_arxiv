    "these experimental values have been found to be consistent with the equation of state determined by a diagrammatic path integral monte carlo approach  @xcite . given the disagreement between our value and that reported in the literature , we speculate that the fourth - order virial coefficient of the trapped system changes sign in the medium- or high - temperature limit , implying that the applied extrapolation scheme does not predict the correct medium- and/or high - temperature behavior of @xmath19 . if this conclusion is correct , it would follow that the determination of the medium- and high - temperature behavior of the fourth - order virial coefficient of the trapped systems requires , if determined via the microscopic energy spectra , knowledge of large portions of the energy spectra of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 systems .",
    "this suggests that other approaches , based on feynman diagrams or based on simulating the finite temperature behavior directly numerically , may be more suitable than the approach pursued here for determining the temperature - dependence of @xmath19",

    "high precision measurements of the equation of state in the high - temperature regime might reveal if @xmath201 changes sign as a function of temperature .",
    "more generally , we find that the low - temperature limit of @xmath202 at unitarity is fully determined by the low - temperature behavior of @xmath203 and @xmath171 . to arrive at this result , we derive explicit expressions for @xmath204 and @xmath205 for @xmath206 , and determine the low - temperature behavior of all terms that enter into @xmath204 and @xmath205 . using the ground state energies at unitarity for trapped two - component fermi gases with up to @xmath207 ( with @xmath208 or 1 )  @xcite , we find that @xmath204 falls off faster than @xmath205 with decreasing @xmath22 , thus allowing us to obtain analytic expressions for the leading order low - temperature behavior of @xmath202 : @xmath209\\exp[-(2n-3/2 ) \\tilde{\\omega}]/(2n)$ ] and @xmath210 for @xmath211 .",
