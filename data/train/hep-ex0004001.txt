    "of the four fundamental normalization branching fractions of charmed hadrons ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath13 ) , the @xmath0 branching fraction is the least well - known , and presently the most controversial .",

    "one can deduce a total semileptonic branching fraction for @xmath49 decays @xmath50 assuming that the total semileptonic width is the same in @xmath49 decays as in @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 ( the approximate equality of the semileptonic widths for all the charmed mesons lends credence to this assumption , although mass and phase space effects in semileptonic decays may be significant@xcite ) , and assuming @xmath541.0@xcite ( i.e. , @xmath55 ) . under these assumptions",
    ", one can estimate the absolute branching fraction for @xmath56 , and , correspondingly , the absolute branching fraction for @xmath0 from the measured @xmath57 yields .",
    "such a procedure yields values in the range of @xmath586 - 8%@xcite .    in the second approach",
    ", one uses the fact that baryon number must be conserved in @xmath59-decay and that @xmath601.0 . under the assumption that baryon production in @xmath59-decay occurs through @xmath61",
    ", the observed @xmath62 events provide an unbiased sample of @xmath63 .",
    "measurements of the @xmath0 yield in such events therefore allow a determination of the absolute @xmath0 branching fraction@xcite .- decay indicates that diagrams other than @xmath61 may contribute substantially to @xmath49 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 production in @xmath59-decay@xcite . ]",
    "the particle data group uses a combination of this technique and @xmath66 and @xmath49 charm semileptonic measurements to estimate @xmath67%@xcite .    in this measurement",
    ", we employ a new technique to determine @xmath13 using @xmath68 annihilation continuum events .",
    "we select a sample of @xmath69 events in which a @xmath49 is expected to be present by requiring : ( i ) a charm tag consisting of either a high momentum electron , a @xmath70 ( from @xmath71 ) , or a fully reconstructed @xmath1-meson candidate and ( ii ) an opposite hemisphere baryon tag consisting of an antiproton .",
    "the presence of a @xmath49 is inferred , to compensate baryon number and charm . according to monte carlo simulations ,",
    "the antiproton in @xmath72 events is as likely to have its momentum in the same hemisphere as the @xmath1 as in the hemisphere opposite it .",
    "however , estimation of the non-@xmath49 background in our @xmath73 sample is more reliable if we require the antiproton to be in the hemisphere opposite the charm tag .",
    "we therefore focus on the sample in which the antiproton is in the hemisphere opposite the charm tag ( `` o(@xmath74 ) '' events , with parentheses designating opposite hemisphere correlations )",

    ", we take the ratio of the number of times that three particles ( the @xmath49 , antiproton , and our charm tag ) are found in the same event relative to the number of times that only the antiproton and the charm tag are found . for the second technique ,",
    "only a double correlation between the reconstructed @xmath49 and the antiproton tag constitutes the numerator of our ratio ; the recoiling charm tag is assumed .",
    "this analysis was performed using the cleo  ii detector operating at the cornell electron storage ring ( cesr ) at center - of - mass energies @xmath80 = 10.5210.58 gev .",
    "the cleo  ii detector is a general purpose solenoidal magnet spectrometer and calorimeter designed to trigger efficiently on two - photon , tau - pair , and hadronic events@xcite .",
    "measurements of charged particle momenta are made with three nested coaxial drift chambers consisting of 6 , 10 , and 51 layers , respectively .",
    "these chambers fill the volume from @xmath81=3 cm to @xmath81=1 m , with @xmath81 being the radial coordinate relative to the beam ( @xmath82 ) axis .",
    "this system is very efficient ( @xmath8398% ) for detecting tracks that have transverse momenta ( @xmath84 ) relative to the beam axis greater than 200 mev/@xmath85 , and that are contained within the good fiducial volume of the drift chamber ( @xmath860.94 , with @xmath87 defined as the polar angle relative to the beam axis ) .",
    "this system achieves a momentum resolution of @xmath88 ( @xmath89 is the momentum , measured in gev/@xmath85 ) .",
    "pulse height measurements in the main drift chamber provide specific ionization resolution of 5.5% for bhabha events , giving good @xmath90 separation for tracks with momenta up to 700 mev/@xmath85 and separation of order 2@xmath91 in the relativistic rise region above 2 gev/@xmath85 . outside",
    "the central tracking chambers are plastic scintillation counters , which are used as a fast element in the trigger system and also provide particle identification information from time - of - flight measurements .    beyond the time - of - flight system",
    "is the electromagnetic calorimeter , consisting of 7800 thallium - doped csi crystals .",
    "the central `` barrel '' region of the calorimeter covers about 75% of the solid angle and has an energy resolution which is empirically found to follow @xmath92 @xmath93 is the shower energy in gev .",
    "this parameterization includes effects such as noise , and translates to an energy resolution of about 4% at 100 mev and 1.2% at 5 gev .",
    "two end - cap regions of the crystal calorimeter extend solid angle coverage to about 95% of @xmath94 , although energy resolution is not as good as that of the barrel region .",
    "the tracking system , time - of - flight counters , and calorimeter are all contained within a superconducting coil operated at 1.5 tesla . flux return and tracking chambers used for muon detection are located immediately outside the coil and in the two end - cap regions .    the event sample used for this measurement",
    "is comprised of 3.1 @xmath95 of data collected at the @xmath96(4s ) resonance and 1.6 @xmath95 of data collected about 60 mev below the @xmath96(4s ) resonance .",
    "approximately @xmath97 continuum @xmath98 events are included in this sample .      in order to suppress background and enrich the hadronic fraction of our event sample , we impose several event requirements .",
    "candidate events must have : ( 1 ) at least four detected , good quality , charged tracks ; ( 2 ) an event vertex consistent with the known @xmath68 interaction point ; ( 3 ) a total measured visible event energy , defined as the sum of the measured energy carried by charged tracks plus the measured energy carried by neutral particles ( @xmath99 ) greater than 110% of the single beam energy , @xmath100 @xmath101 1.1 @xmath102 @xmath103 . in addition , when using an electron to tag a @xmath98 event we require that either the beam energy @xmath103 be less than 5.275 gev ( below the @xmath96(4s)@xmath104 threshold ) or that the event be well collimated .",
    "specifically , the ratio of fox - wolfram event shape parameters @xmath105 can be used to quantify the `` jettiness '' of an event@xcite  for a perfectly spherical flow of event energy , this ratio equals 0 ; for a perfectly jetty event , this ratio equals 1.0 . for our electron tags , we require this ratio to be greater than 0.35 .",
    "this final requirement helps remove contamination from semileptonic @xmath59-decays in @xmath106 events .",
    "( the correlation between the soft pion momentum vector and the thrust axis is absent in @xmath107 events , therefore @xmath107 events do not contribute to our soft pion - tagged event sample . )",
    "for our analysis , we select continuum hadronic events which , in addition to an antiproton , contain either a high momentum electron ( from @xmath108 ) , a @xmath70 ( from @xmath71 ) , or a fully reconstructed @xmath1-meson candidate as a charm tag ( `` @xmath1 '' ) of @xmath109 events . since the different tags have different systematic uncertainties and procedures associated with them , we now discuss separately the various tags employed in this measurement , beginning with our electron charm tags .",
    "to suppress background from fake electrons , as well as true electrons not necessarily associated with charm decays in @xmath110 @xmath98 events , we require that our electron - tag candidates satisfy the following criteria :    \\(a ) the electron must pass a strict `` probability of electron '' identification criterion .",
    "this identification likelihood combines measurements of a given track s specific ionization deposition in the central drift chamber with the ratio of the energy of the associated calorimeter shower to the charged track s momentum@xcite .",
    "true electrons have shower energies approximately equal to their drift chamber momenta ; hadrons tend to be minimum ionizing and have considerably smaller values of shower energy relative to their measured momenta .",
    "we require that the logarithm of the ratio of a charged track s electron probability relative to the probability that the charged track is a hadron be greater than 7.0 . in the good fiducial volume of the cleo detector ( @xmath860.7 , where @xmath87 is the track s polar angle measured relative to the @xmath68 beam axis ) , the efficiency of this requirement is @xmath10190% in our momentum interval of interest ; the likelihood of a non - electron faking an electron is less than 1% .",
    "the total electron fake fraction is thus the product of the fake rate per track times the typical charged track multiplicity and is therefore not large ( @xmath11110% ) .",
    "\\(b ) the momentum of the electron must be greater than 1 gev/@xmath85 .",
    "this criterion helps eliminate fake electrons due to kaon and pion tracks and also suppresses electrons from photon conversions ( @xmath112 ) and @xmath113 dalitz decays ( @xmath114 ) .",
    "\\(c ) the electron must have an impact parameter ( `` doca '' , or distance - of - closest - approach ) relative to the primary event vertex of less than 4 mm along the radial coordinate and no more than 2 cm along the beam axis .",
    "this provides additional suppression of electrons resulting from photon conversions .",
    "our soft - pion tag candidates must pass the following restrictions :    \\(a ) the pion must have an impact parameter relative to the event vertex of less than 5 mm along the radial coordinate and no more than 5 cm along the beam axis .",
    "\\(b ) the pion must pass a 99% probability criterion for pion identification , based on the associated specific ionization collected in the drift chamber .",
    "\\(c ) the pion s momentum must lie between 0.15 gev/@xmath85 and 0.40 gev/@xmath85 .",
    "\\(d ) the pion s trajectory must lie near the trajectory of the parent charm quark , as expected for pions produced in @xmath115 .",
    "experimentally , this is checked using the variable @xmath116 , where @xmath87 is the opening angle between the candidate soft pion and the event thrust axis@xcite .",

    "`` tags '' , charged particles detected in the central drift chamber must also pass strict particle identification criteria .",
    "using the available time - of - flight and drift chamber specific ionization measurements for each track , the likelihood that a particle be an antiproton must be at least nine times larger than the likelihood that the particle be a @xmath126 or a @xmath127 .",
    "antiproton tag candidates must also pass the same vertex requirements as soft pion and electron candidates .",
    "these vertex criteria help suppress backgrounds from non - primary antiprotons ( from @xmath128 , e.g. ) or baryons generated by collisions of beam particles with either the beampipe itself or residual gas within the beampipe .",
    "it is important that our antiproton tags be direct , and not hyperon daughters . by combining our antiproton candidates with remaining charged tracks in the same event ( assumed to be pions )",

    "if the beam - gas / beam - wall contamination is large , we expect there to be a preponderance of proton tags compared to antiproton tags .",
    "in fact , in a @xmath1-meson tagged subset of the full data used in this analysis , we find the number of proton tags ( 6980@xmath14255 ) to be statistically equal to the number of antiproton tags ( 6737@xmath14250 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the difference between these two numbers is taken as our systematic uncertainty in the magnitude of beam - related backgrounds ( table ii ) .",
    "in the triple correlation analysis , we tag the @xmath132 side of an @xmath109 event using a soft pion or an electron tag , then search for a @xmath133 in the opposite hemisphere . in order to conserve both charm and baryon number",
