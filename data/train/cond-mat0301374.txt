    "the understanding of the structure of metal clusters has seen many developments in recent years,@xcite however there is still much to be learnt . from the theoretical perspective ,",
    "for example , only relatively recently have global optimization techniques become sufficiently powerful to find the most stable structures of metal clusters with up to 100 atoms,@xcite even when described by relatively simple many - body potentials .",
    "this has led to many interesting new structures being revealed@xcite that go beyond those classified for pair potentials , but there are still probably many classes of structure that remain undiscovered . furthermore , the many - body nature of the bonding makes it difficult to unravel the relationship between the observed structures and the form of the interactions , although there has been some interesting recent progress.@xcite this situation contrasts with that for pair potentials , where , for example , the effects of the width of the potential well@xcite and oscillations in the potential@xcite on the cluster structure have been mapped out and rationalized .",
    "one of the more interesting recent discoveries has been that some monatomic metal clusters@xcite can exhibit structures with polytetrahedral order,@xcite i.e. the whole of the cluster can be naturally divided up into tetrahedra with atoms at their vertices.@xcite in the experiments of dassenoy _ et al . _  on cobalt clusters , the electron microscopy images and diffraction patterns could not be explained by any of the usual structural forms for a cluster , but instead were consistent with a polytetrahedral structure.@xcite furthermore , the magic number at @xmath3 in the mass spectrum of strontium clusters@xcite was assigned to a polytetrahedral structure,@xcite and the next magic number at @xmath4 also coincides with a polytetrahedral magic number.@xcite similar magic number patterns have also been found for some rare - earth metals.@xcite    ( a ) packings of regular tetrahedra to illustrate the strain inherent in polytetrahedral packings .",
    "five regular tetrahedra around a common edge produce a gap of @xmath5 , and twenty regular tetrahedra about a common vertex produce gaps equivalent to a solid angle of 1.54 steradians .",
    "( b ) the frank - kasper polyhedra for coordination numbers 12 , 14 , 15 and 16 , as labelled .",
    "the associated disclination networks are placed next to each cluster.,width=317 ]    these results seem somewhat surprising since ordered polytetrahedral structures are restricted to alloys in bulk , e.g the crystalline frank - kasper phases@xcite and quasicrystals,@xcite structural models of which often invoke substantial polytetrahedral order.@xcite however , as we will see , there are good reasons why polytetrahedral structures are more likely to be seen for monatomic systems in clusters .",
    "figure [ fig : gaps](a ) illustrates that all space can not be packed with regular tetrahedra .",
    "( for this reason polytetrahedral structures are sometimes said to be frustrated.@xcite ) therefore , the nearest - neighbour pair distances in a polytetrahedral structure can not all take the same value .",
    "for example to close the gaps associated with the icosahedral packing of regular tetrahedra , the tetrahedra must be distorted such that the edges of the tetrahedra on the surface are 5% longer than the radial edges . for a monatomic system",
    "this strain usually leads to an energetic penalty , although for a binary system , if a smaller atom of the right size is placed in the centre of the icosahedron , all pair distances could still take their ideal values .    for clusters of sufficiently small size the energetic penalties associated with the strain inherent to polytetrahedral structures",
    "can often be more than compensated by a favourable surface energy .",
    "the surface of a polytetrahedral cluster is triangulated leading to high coordination numbers , whereas clusters based on a close - packing scheme may have to expose @xmath6 faces , which involve atoms with lower coordination number , and hence typically have a higher surface energy .",
    "the 13-atom icosahedral structure , which is very common for systems interacting with both pair potentials and many - body metal potentials , illustrates this principle .",
    "the polytetrahedral packing of the icosahedron can be continued by adding capping atoms above the faces and vertices.@xcite this `` anti - mackay '' overlayer leads to polyicosahedral structures , where each atom in the interior of the cluster has local icosahedral coordination .",
    "so , the 19-atom double icosahedron is also common , but as the size increases these structures become less likely to be observed . for example , for lennard - jones clusters they are lowest in energy up to @xmath7.@xcite",
    "the reason that these clusters become disfavoured is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : gaps](a ) . as further regular tetrahedra",
    "are added to these packings the gaps involved become larger and larger , and hence the strain energy associated with polyicosahedral packings increases very rapidly with size .    for the above polytetrahedral clusters , there are five tetrahedra around each edge in the interior of the cluster . to balance out the increasing gaps in this type of packing",
    ", the bulk frank - kasper phases also involve sites where six tetrahedra share a common edge  a negative disclination is said to run along this edge.@xcite although the local distortion required to remove the overlap when six regular tetrahedra are placed around a common edge is larger , the introduction of disclination lines leads to a decrease in the overall strain .",
    "the coordination polyhedra involved in the frank - kasper phases@xcite are depicted in figure [ fig : gaps](b ) .",
    "local icosahedral coordination involves no disclinations , but as the coordination number increases negative disclinations must be introduced .",
    "note a disclination line can only end by forming a loop or exiting at a surface .",
    "so for the z14 coordination polyhedron the disclination passes through the central atom , and for the z15 and z16 coordination polyhedra the central atom acts as a node for three and four disclinations , respectively .",
    "polytetrahedral packings can therefore be described by a network of disclination lines threading an icosahedrally - coordinated medium . in frank - kasper crystals",
    "this disclination network is ordered and periodic,@xcite and is mediated by the z14 , z15 and z16 frank - kasper coordination polyhedra .",
    "polytetrahedral clusters that involve disclinations have previously been found for two very different pair potentials .",
    "firstly , for clusters interacting with a sufficiently long - ranged morse potential the strain involved in a polytetrahedral structure can be tolerated , and ordered polytetrahedral clusters are found up to @xmath8.@xcite secondly , a modified dzugutov potential favours clusters that are based on the c14 and c15 frank - kasper phases up to at least @xmath9.@xcite this potential has a maximum in the potential that has been chosen to coincide with the next - nearest neighbour distance in close - packed structures , and somewhat resembles the friedel oscillations that can occur in effective pair potentials derived for metallic systems.@xcite    these two examples are for somewhat unusual potentials .",
    "however , polytetrahedral structures are perhaps more likely for metals , because the nature of the metallic potentials makes them potentially less sensitive to the strain in the individual pair distances,@xcite for reasons that will be discussed in more detail in section [ sect : potential ] .",
    "for example , similar structures to those of the morse clusters have also been found for clusters described by a generalized set of metallic interactions.@xcite furthermore , in this paper i report that the lowest - energy structures of clusters interacting with an aluminium glue potential@xcite are also polytetrahedral up to at least @xmath10 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [",
    "sect : methods ] the main focus is on the form of the aluminium potential and the implications of this form for cluster structure . in section [ sect : gmin ] i describe in detail the structures of the putative global minima , and in section [ sect : al61 ] i take al@xmath11 as a case study for understanding the reasons for this system s preference for polytetrahedral structures .",
    "then , in section [ sect : large ] i briefly examine the size evolution of the cluster structure at larger sizes .",
    "the emphasis in the paper is less on the clusters as a realistic model of aluminium clusters that will hold up to detailed scrutiny  this is very difficult for any empirical potential  and more on using these clusters as a model system for exploring the types of polytetrahedral structure that metal clusters might exhibit , and the reasons for their formation .",
    "however , in section [ sect : large ] i do compare the results with the available experimental information on the structure of aluminium clusters .",
    "to model the aluminium clusters i use a glue potential@xcite that has been constructed using the force - matching method.@xcite the potential energy is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a short - ranged pair potential , @xmath14 is a many - body glue function and @xmath15 is defined as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is an `` atomic density '' function .",
    "these three functions have been fitted to match the forces produced by first - principles electronic structure calculations for a large set of configurations , including those that correspond to surfaces , clusters , liquids and crystals.@xcite that the potential has been designed to model a wide variety of atomic environments , such as occur in clusters , is particularly important for the current application , as opposed to a potential that has just been fitted to bulk data .",
    "this flexibility has also led the potential to be used in a wide variety of applications , often with considerable success .",
    "examples include clusters,@xcite wires,@xcite surface thermodynamics,@xcite grain boundaries,@xcite bulk@xcite and surface@xcite diffusion and melt solidification.@xcite    the three functions that make up the aluminium glue potential : ( a ) @xmath13 , @xmath17 and ( b ) @xmath14.,width=317 ]    the functions @xmath13 , @xmath17 and @xmath14 are displayed in figure [ fig : potential ] .",
    "the forms of these functions are not assumed , but are determined by the fitting process .",
    "this contrasts with other empirical potentials , such as the gupta or sutton - chen potentials . with these latter types of potentials",
    "it would be impossible , for example , to reproduce the double well structure of @xmath13 , which also occurs for a sophisticated ` bulk ' potential.@xcite    the shape of these functions have some fairly straightforward consequences for the cluster structure .",
    "@xmath14 has a single minimum of depth @xmath18ev at @xmath19 .",
    "this term provides the dominant contribution to the energy , so it is important that each atom has a value of @xmath20 as close as possible to one . of course",
    ", the values associated with the surface atoms will be significantly less than this .",
    "there is therefore a tendency for surface distances to contract so that the atoms achieve as high a value of @xmath20 as is possible .",
    "this effect will be balanced by the energetic penalty associated with the resulting compression of the interior and the reduction in the pair energy of the surface atoms .",
    "furthermore , the minimum of the glue function is rather broad , and so the energy loss associated with @xmath20 values that deviate from one is not so severe .",
    "thus , surface contraction will not be as pronounced as for some other metallic systems .",
    "for example , the lead glue potential,@xcite whose cluster structures have recently been analysed,@xcite has a stronger dependence of @xmath21 on @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath17 decreases roughly linearly with distance until @xmath22 , after which it decays more slowly to zero at the cutoff distance .",
    "as the value of @xmath17 in the latter regime is always small , the major contribution to the @xmath20 values of each atom comes from nearest neighbours , and hence the average value of @xmath15 will be maximized by clusters with a large number of nearest neighbours .",
    "@xmath13 has an interesting double - well structure .",
    "the first minimum occurs at @xmath23 , and has a depth of @xmath24ev .",
    "this is separated by a maximum at @xmath25 from a second minimum at @xmath26 of slightly greater depth , @xmath27ev . as the number of next - nearest neighbours will be significantly larger than nearest neighbours ( except for the smallest clusters ) , the largest contribution to @xmath28 comes from the second neighbour shell .",
    "the ratio of the positions of the two minima would initially suggest that they are almost ideally placed to coincide with the first and second shells for closed - packed structures , which have a ratio of @xmath29 .",
    "however , the nearest - neighbour distance is determined more by the glue part of the potential . for example , for an atom with twelve nearest neighbours , these neighbours would need to be at a distance for 2.611  to achieve a @xmath20 value of 1 .",
    "if the effects of next neighbours are also included , this distance does not not need to be as short , and so the nearest neighbour distance for the equilibrium face - centred - cubic ( fcc ) crystal , @xmath30 , is 2.851.@xcite compared to this distance the position of the second minimum is not so advantageous for closed - packed structures ; @xmath31 .",
    "one of the important features of the glue energy for the current study is that it does not directly depend on the distribution of pair distances or the coordination number of an atom , but only on the @xmath15 values.@xcite this situation contrasts with that for a pair potential , and makes metallic systems potentially less sensitive to internal strains .",
    "this feature has already been cited as an important factor in the stability of disordered clusters for a variety of metallic systems.@xcite the same principle applies for ordered polytetrahedral clusters , which have both strain and high coordination numbers .",
    "for example , the ideal glue energy can be achieved for an atom with coordination number higher than twelve simply by expanding the nearest - neighbour distances for this atom with respect to @xmath30 until @xmath32 for that atom .",
    "similarly , there is no reason why an atom with a wide distribution of nearest - neighbour distances can not also achieve a @xmath20 value of one .",
    "the global optimization of the aluminium clusters was performed using the basin - hopping @xcite ( or monte carlo minimization @xcite ) approach .",
    "this method has proved particularly successful in locating putative global minima for a wide variety of cluster systems . as the results are extended up to 190 atoms , a considerable computational effort was required .",
    "it proved particularly important to supplement the standard unbiased runs from random starting points for each size , with runs started from low - energy minima of nearby sizes with the appropriate number of atoms added or removed .",
    "these latter runs were applied iteratively until no further new global minima were located .",
    "it should be noted that , of course , there is no guarantee that i have been able to locate the true global minima , and the probability that a global minimum has been missed will increase with cluster size , as the size of the search space , and hence the number of minima,@xcite increases exponentially with @xmath33 .",
    "however , from examination of the statistics of how often independent runs locate the same lowest - energy minimum , i am confident that virtually all of the putative global minima up to @xmath34 can not be bettered , and that beyond this size the putative global minima , if not truly global , are very good estimates . in this latter size range",
    "the runs seeded from low - energy clusters of other sizes become more important . therefore , global minima are most likely to be missed when they are structurally different from those of nearby sizes . for example , the lowest - energy structure found in a basin - hopping run for al@xmath35 was at @xmath36ev , even though the 147-atom mackay icosahedron has an energy that is @xmath37ev lower . however , this is the only example i found where reoptimization of a structure that is known to often be particularly stable bettered the global optimization results .",
    "i also tried to construct large polytetrahedral structures based upon some of the structural motifs present for @xmath38 , but again this did not lead to any improvements .",
    "the energies and point groups for the putative global minima are given in table [ table : gmin ] .",
    "point files are available online at the cambridge cluster database.@xcite the energies of the global minima are represented in figure [ fig : evn ] in such a way that makes particularly stable clusters stand out .",
    "a selection of clusters are depicted in figure [ fig : structures ] that are either particularly stable or have some interesting structural feature .",
    "most of the intermediate sizes involve structures similar to those in this figure , but normally with a somewhat incomplete surface structure .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     given the large value of @xmath39 for the global minimum and that @xmath40 lies closest to the potential minimum",
    ", it is not so surprising that the global minimum has the lowest value of @xmath41 .",
    "however , it is only marginally lower than that for the fcc cluster , which in turn is lower than the icosahedral cluster ( figure [ fig : edecomp](b ) ) even though it has fewer nearest neighbours .",
    "these effects can be understood by taking account of the distribution of @xmath42 values .",
    "as @xmath13 has positive curvature in this region , @xmath43 must be positive .",
    "as is evident from figure [ fig : edecomp](a ) and the @xmath44 values in table [ table : edecomp ] , the global minimum has the widest distribution of nearest - neighbour distances , and hence by far the largest @xmath43 .",
    "by contrast the fcc cluster has the narrowest distribution and smallest @xmath43 .",
    "this explains why @xmath41 for the fcc cluster is actually lower than that for the icosahedral cluster and only just above that for the global minimum .",
    "the large value of @xmath44 for the global minimum reflects the distortions of the tetrahedra away from regularity that are necessary in any polytetrahedral packing .",
    "@xmath41 , however , only represents roughly a quarter of the total pair energy ; the dominant contribution energy comes from next neighbours .",
    "there are a number of possible configurations for such neighbours .",
    "the nearest next neighbours correspond to those at opposite vertices of an octahedron , which if regular corresponds to a separation of @xmath45 .",
    "these configurations occur most frequently in the fcc clusters , also occur in the twenty fcc tetrahedra that make up the mackay icosahedron , but do not occur at all in a polytetrahedral structure .",
    "the next set of pair distances correspond to atoms at opposite ends of a trigonal bipyramid , which if it is made of two regular tetrahedra occurs at @xmath46 .",
    "these configurations are absent from fcc clusters , occur around the fivefold axes of the mackay icosahedra and also across the twin planes between the strained fcc tetrahedra that make up the icosahedron and are most prevalent in polytetrahedral clusters",
    ".    then , there are pairs at the extreme ends of a planar rhombus , which if it consists of two equilateral triangles would be at a separation of @xmath47 .",
    "however , these pairs , which are most common in the fcc structures due to the close - packed planes , are less important to the energetics because , of the three sets of configurations , they are the furthest from the second minimum in the pair potential .    given that @xmath31 , one might expect from the above ideal configurations that the octahedral pairs would lie slightly closer to the second potential minimum than those pairs at opposite ends of a trigonal bipyramid .",
    "however , the contraction of @xmath48 with respect to the crystal takes the octahedral distances further away from this minimum .",
    "furthermore , the wide distribution of nearest neighbour distances in the polytetrahedral structures also leads to a wide variation in the dimensions of the trigonal bipyramids .",
    "as can be seen from figure [ fig : edecomp](a ) a significant fraction of these polytetrahedral pairs for the global minimum lie closer to the pair potential minimum than the octahedral distances .",
    "these effects are responsible for the substantially lower pair energy of the global minimum ( figure [ fig : edecomp](b ) ) .",
    "the trigonal bipyramids present in the icosahedral structure also cause the difference in the total pair energy between it and the fcc structure to narrow , compared to that for @xmath41 .",
    "similar to the analysis for @xmath41 the glue energy can be written as @xmath49 where the first term is the glue energy that would result if all atoms had the same value of @xmath20 ( @xmath50 is the average value of @xmath20 ) , and the second term is the correction due to the @xmath51 having a distribution of values .",
    "we can examine the role of different pair distances on the glue energy by following @xmath52 , the contribution to @xmath50 from pairs of atoms that are separated by less than @xmath53 .",
    "it is clear from figure [ fig :",
    "edecomp](c ) that , as anticipated , the major contribution to @xmath50 comes from nearest neighbours , and the values of @xmath52 after the nearest - neighbour shell reflect the relative values of @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath40 is also important .",
    "the average contribution to @xmath54 from each nearest neighbour in the global minimum is less because of the longer @xmath40 . indeed , if the three structures had the same @xmath40 the polytetrahedral structure would have comfortably the lowest glue energy .",
    "the differences in @xmath44 have little effect , because the function @xmath17 is approximately linear for the relevant range of @xmath53 ( figure [ fig : potential](a ) ) .",
    "as @xmath17 is a monotonically decreasing function , the next largest contribution to @xmath50 comes from octahedral next neighbours .",
    "all other pairs have little effect on the relative values of @xmath50 for the different structures because by these distances @xmath17 is small in magnitude .",
    "the effect of next - nearest neighbours is to cause @xmath50 for the icosahedral structure to just overtake that for the global minimum , and similarly to diminish the difference between @xmath50 for the global minimum and the fcc structure , compared to the relative values of @xmath52 after the nearest - neighbour shell .",
    "the ordering of the @xmath50 values agrees with that for @xmath55 .",
    "however , although the global minimum has a similar value of @xmath50 to that for the icosahedral structure , its glue energy is only just greater than that for the fcc structure .",
    "this effect can be explained by taking into account the distribution of @xmath15 values .",
    "as @xmath14 has positive curvature , @xmath56 must be positive , and is in fact largest for the global minimum because it has the greatest variance in @xmath15 values ( table [ table : edecomp ] ) .",
    "to a first approximation the distribution of @xmath15 values is bimodal with similar values for surface atoms , and similar values for interior atoms . as the polytetrahedral cluster has the most atoms in the interior of the cluster due to the high coordination numbers , it has the largest @xmath57 .",
    "as we have pointed out above the value of @xmath40 is important for the values of both @xmath28 and @xmath55 , so it is important to understand what determines @xmath40 . at @xmath40",
    "the decrease in the glue energy by uniformly shrinking the cluster is exactly balanced by the increase in the pair energy .",
    "this energy balance occurs at larger @xmath40 for the global minimum for a number of reasons .",
    "firstly , the decrease in the glue energy as the cluster is shrunk ( this increases the @xmath20 values of the surface atoms ) is smallest for the global minimum because it has the fewest number of atoms in the surface of the cluster and has some atoms with high coordination number in the cluster interior ( see below ) .",
    "secondly , the non - linear increase in the pair energy as the cluster is shrunk is largest for the global minimum .",
    "this mainly stems from the nearest - neighbour contribution and reflects both the greater number of nearest neighbours for the global minimum and its greater @xmath44 .",
    "the average nearest - neighbour distance also shows a systematic dependence on the coordination number . for energetic ( see section [ sect : potential ] ) and geometric reasons the atoms with higher coordination numbers have larger average nearest - neighbour distances .",
    "for example , the nearest neighbours of the sixteen - coordinate atom in the centre of the global minimum are at an average separation of 2.933 , whereas the corresponding distance for the 12-coordinate atoms is 2.725 .",
    "although the analysis in this section has been done here for a single case study , similar analyses for other cluster sizes have revealed the same principles at work .",
    "although polytetrahedral clusters are dominant in the size range considered in the last section , one would expect that clusters at sufficiently large size would adopt the bulk structure , which for aluminium is fcc .",
    "this assumes that the current glue potential can correctly reproduce the bulk structure .",
    "however , to the best of my knowledge , the relative energetics for different crystal structures have not been compared for this potential ; for a somewhat similar aluminium empirical potential the fcc crystal is only marginally lower in energy than an a15 frank - kasper phase.@xcite     a comparison of the relative values of ( a ) @xmath58 , ( b ) @xmath28 and ( c ) @xmath55 for the global minima for @xmath59 ( gmin ) , and sequences of fcc truncated octahedra with hexagonal @xmath60 facets ( fcc ) , mackay icosahedra ( icos ) and marks decahedra ( deca ) . in each graph",
    "the energies are measured relative to fits to those for the truncated octahedra , where @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 . in ( a ) @xmath64 ,",
    "the fit to energies of the global minima used in fig .",
    "[ fig : evn ] , has also been plotted .",
    ", width=317 ]    that for al@xmath11 , and all the other clusters we examined in detail , @xmath65 is lower than that for the polytetrahedral and icosahedral clusters ( table [ table : edecomp ] ) suggests that the system will converge to the correct bulk structure . to further understand the size evolution of the cluster structure i have reoptimized a series of mackay icosahedra , fcc truncated octahedra and marks decahedra , which are usually the optimal shapes for these morphologies.@xcite the energies of these sequences are compared in figure [ fig : e_large](a ) along with the global minima obtained in the section [ sect : gmin ] .",
    "i have not attempted to construct a sequence of larger polytetrahedral clusters , because one can not easily deduce from the global minima how the polytetrahedral growth sequence should continue .",
    "instead , we also plot @xmath64 , the fit to the energies of the global minima .    from figure [ fig : e_large](a ) it is clear that decahedral structures are never competitive for this potential .",
    "this is slightly unusual as it is often found that for materials which are close - packed in bulk , there is a progression from icosahedral to decahedral to close - packed structures as the size increases . instead , the icosahedral and fcc lines cross at @xmath66 suggesting that beyound this size fcc clusters will be lower in energy for the majority of sizes",
    ". the @xmath64 curve also seems to suggest that these fcc clusters will be global minima , but one has to be somewhat careful .",
    "firstly , one should not necessarily trust this function outside the size range to which it has been fitted .",
    "secondly , it represents the average energy of the polytetrahedral global minima , whereas the other curves in figure [ fig : e_large](a ) are lower bounds to the energies of the clusters of that type . for example",
    ", @xmath64 only dips below the interpolated energies of the complete mackay icosahedra for a small range of @xmath33 , even though polytetrahedral structures are the global minima for the vast majority of the size range considered in section [ sect : gmin ] .    to get a better idea of the causes of this size evolution",
    "i have plotted in figures [ fig : e_large](b ) and ( c ) the glue and pair contribution to the energies of these sequences of structures .",
    "it is immediately clear , in agreement with the analysis of al@xmath11 , that the polytetrahedral global minima are stabilized by their particularly low pair energies .",
    "furthermore , the global minima that are based on mackay icosahedra at @xmath6755 and 147 clearly stand out from this trend .",
    "it is also clear that the crossover from icosahedral to fcc structures is driven by the increasing advantage provided by its lower pair energy .",
    "by contrast , the glue energy of the icosahedron only becomes greater than that for the truncated octahedra at @xmath68 .",
    "@xmath55 more strongly reflects the greater number of nearest neighbours associated with the mackay icosahedra and is less sensitive to the strain inherent to the icosahedra .",
    "by contrast , as noted in section [ sect : gmin ] and as is usual for pair potentials,@xcite the nearest neighbour contribution to the pair energy is reduced due to the strain in the pair distances for the icosahedra .",
    "although i have focussed on the general principles that can be drawn from the current results , given that the potential has been successfully used in a wide variety of applications , with in some cases excellent agreement with experimental data,@xcite one would hope that this system would also be a reasonable model for real aluminium clusters .",
    "however , one should remember that to correctly predict the energetics of cluster structure requires that the potential can successfully describe a wide variety of surface and bulk properties for a variety of structural types , and so is an extremely stringent test of a potential .",
    "although aluminium clusters have been much studied experimentally , there is little reliable information about the geometric structure in the size range of the global minima considered in section [ sect : gmin ] .",
    "the difficulty is that features in the experimental data can originate from the electronic shell structure rather than the geometric structure . indeed , following the successful interpretation of many of the properties of alkali metal clusters in terms of the electronic shell structure , aluminium , a nearly free - electron metal ,",
    "was a natural system to see how widely applicable these ideas might be .",
    "indications of this electronic shell structure were found from the ionization potentials,@xcite the magic numbers in mass spectra,@xcite cluster ion mobilities@xcite and photoelectron spectroscopy@xcite .",
    "however , a significant number of the features in these properties could not be explained thus , and so these were usually attributed to the effects of the geometric structure .",
    "noteworthy of these is the magic number at @xmath69 , whose most obvious interpretation is in terms of a mackay icosahedron .",
    "no convincing explanations , however , have been given for the other ` geometric ' features .",
    "for example , except for @xmath69 , the magic numbers do not correspond to those of any of the usual structural forms for clusters , but neither do they correspond to the new polytetrahedral magic numbers found here .    theoretically , aluminium clusters in this size range have been recently studied using two empirical potentials , namely the murrell - mottram@xcite and gupta@xcite forms . for",
    "both these system icosahedral structures predominate for the global minima , although with fcc and decahedral structures competing at sizes intermediate between the complete mackay icosahedra .",
    "i have also reoptimized a series of icosahedral , decahedral , fcc and polytetrahedral clusters for the potential of mishin _ et al .",
    "_ , whose @xmath13 , @xmath17 and @xmath14 functions resemble those for the current glue potential and were fit to a wide range of bulk data.@xcite in this case polytetrahedral structures again predominate .",
    "there have also been many electronic structure calculations of small aluminium clusters using a variety of methods.@xcite for small clusters there has been some success in identifying the structure for @xmath70 by comparing calculated photoelectron spectra with experiment.@xcite however , for somewhat larger clusters there is little consensus among the results , partially because the computational expense prevents one rigorously searching for the global minimum  usually only a selection of clusters are compared  but also because different methodologies simply give different results .",
    "for example , there is disagreement over whether for al@xmath71 the mackay icosahedron@xcite or the fcc cuboctahedron@xcite is lower in energy , and still others have found disordered structures to be lower in energy than both.@xcite a similar range of results have been found for al@xmath35.@xcite    for large aluminium clusters there are clear experimental indicators of the geometric structure . for @xmath72 ( up to at least @xmath73 ) there are set of regular spaced magic numbers in the mass spectra.@xcite initially , this result was interpreted in terms of electronic - shell effects,@xcite but martin _ et al .",
    "_ soon showed that the magic numbers were in fact due to octahedra , with each additional magic number corresponding to the addition of a complete overlayer to a single face of the octahedra.@xcite growth simulations further added to the plausibility of this interpretation.@xcite    for large clusters one should always ask whether the observed structures occur because they are most stable or because of the growth kinetics .",
    "this is especially the case here , because the most stable fcc clusters are usually more spherical truncated octahedra,@xcite rather than octahedra .",
    "indeed as the life times of the clusters are increased , the magic numbers disappear,@xcite indicating their kinetic origin .",
    "however , it is probably reasonable to conclude that fcc structures are most stable in this size range , even if the appearance of octahedra is a kinetic effect that results from the nucleation of a new face being slower than the subsequent growth .",
    "my estimate that fcc structures become lowest in energy beyond @xmath2 is therefore reasonably close to experiment .",
    "this contrasts with the gupta potential where fcc structures only become more stable beyond @xmath74 and the murrell - mottram potential where the crossover occurs at even larger sizes.@xcite however , one should remember that these energetic crossover sizes are only strictly valid at @xmath75k .",
    "if one compares the relative free energies , the crossover sizes can be sensitively dependent on the temperature , mainly due to the differences in the vibrational entropy of the competing structures.@xcite",
    "i have found that the global minimum of aluminium clusters described by a glue potential to be predominantly polytetrahedral for @xmath76 .",
    "the structure of the larger clusters can be described in terms of their disclination networks , which resemble those of the square - triangle frank - kasper phases .",
    "this result is somewhat surprising given that ordered polytetrahedral structures are only found for alloys in bulk , but it reflects the greater tendency for polytetrahedral order in clusters .",
    "the bulk behaviour should of course emerge for sufficiently large clusters , and our results suggest that for @xmath77 clusters with the bulk fcc structure predominate .    an important aspect of this work has been to relate the observed structures back to the interatomic interactions .",
    "polytetrahedral structures are favoured for a combination of reasons .",
    "firstly , the clusters present surfaces with a low surface energy and high average cooordination number , so will be potentially favoured at small sizes . secondly , the glue function , which gives rise to most of the cohesive energy of the clusters , is relatively insensitive to the strain in the pair distances and the high coordination numbers that are inevitable in polytetrahedral structures .",
    "thirdly , as with the modified dzugutov potential,@xcite the two minima in the pair potential most closely match the distances in polytetrahedral structures .",
    "as the first two of these reasons are true for most metal potentials , it is not so surprising that there is experimental evidence of polytetrahedral structures for monatomic cobalt,@xcite strontium,@xcite and perhaps some rare - earth@xcite clusters . nor",
    "would it be surprising if the number of theoretical and experimental examples were to increase .",
    "my results further@xcite illustrate the types of polytetrahedral structures that one might expect for such clusters , along with a series of magic numbers that will be useful in comparisons with experiment .",
    "whether the preference for polytetrahedral structures in the current model carries over to real aluminium clusters is not yet clear . because of the lack of easily interpretable experimental data on the geometric structure of aluminium clusters with less than 190 atoms , it is hard to draw any firm conclusions about the realism of the structures predicted by the glue potential in this size range .",
    "moreover , _",
    "ab intio _ calculations add little further insight because of the lack of consensus .",
    "however , comparisons to the experimental data for larger clusters suggest that the glue potential is more realistic than the other empirical potentials for which calculations have been performed .    the properties of these clusters can also provide useful insights into the behaviour observed for this potential in other contexts . for example",
    ", studies on aluminium nanowires have found polytetrahedral structures for those wires with sufficiently small cross - section.@xcite some of these involve only icosahedral local coordination , but others clearly involve disclinations .",
    "for example , the wire that glseren _ et al .",
    "_ denote as a7 has a single disclination running along the centre of the wire .",
    "similarly , from the current results it should be unsurprising that there is strong polytetrahedral ordering in the aluminium melt described by this potential.@xcite"
