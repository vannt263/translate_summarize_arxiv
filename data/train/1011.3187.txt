    "quantum information theory is currently an active research field in physics .",
    "entanglement is one of its core concepts .",
    "besides being of interest from a fundamental point of view , entanglement also has many potential physical applications such as quantum teleportation , quantum cryptography and quantum algorithms @xcite .",
    "we have already had a good understanding for the bipartite entanglement so far .",
    "entanglement of formation ( eof ) and concurrence are the two widely used measures of bipartite entanglement  although the analytical expressions are still limited to few special cases @xcite .",
    "however , the situation of multipartite entanglement turns rather complicated .",
    "one basic fact is , an n - body quantum state can be k - separable , i.e. , it can be viewed as the direct product of k parts , where @xmath0 . to date",
    ", the understanding of many - body entanglement is still very limited .",
    "this paper will focus on the simplest many - body system , namely the n - qubit system , which has received considerable attention @xcite .    how to operate a quantum system from one state to another ?",
    "the so - called locc ( local operations and classical communication ) and slocc ( stochastic locc ) are the natural and basic operations . we know that two ( multi - body ) pure states can be transformed each other under locc if and only if they can be transformed by local unitary transformations , and two ( multi - body ) pure states can be transformed each other under slocc if and only if they can be transformed by local transformations @xcite",
    ". so the mathematical characterization of local operations @xmath1 and @xmath2 becomes important in many aspects such as entanglement classification and implementation of transformation of many - body quantum system .",
    "uhlmann @xcite noted that the antilinear operators are intrinsically nonlocal , so it is seemly natural to use antilinear operators to describe the entanglement . along this thought , some fruitful works @xcite have been done . in @xcite",
    "the authors introduced the pseudo - orthogonal basis to the hilbert space of 2 qubits , and studied the operators which preserve the pseudo inner product in the space spanned by the pseudo - orthogonal basis . by this way",
    ", they realized the group homomorphic mapping @xmath3 to @xmath4 .",
    "in other words , for any local operation of @xmath3 , we can always find an orthogonal matrix of @xmath4 to describe it .",
    "the present paper will generalize this approach : in the hilbert space @xmath5of n qubits , we introduce the symplectic space @xmath6 ( n is odd ) and the orthogonal space @xmath7 ( n is even ) via the spin - flip operator .",
    "we also define the spin - flip operator on the linear operator spaces @xmath8 and @xmath9 which are spaces of all linear operators on @xmath10 , respectively . under this mathematical structure",
    "we discuss some properties of n qubits , including homomorphically mapping the local operations of n qubits into the symplectic group or orthogonal group , and prove that the generalized `` magic basis '' is just the bi - orthonormal basis ( that is , the orthonormal basis of both hilbert space and the orthogonal space ) .",
    "we end by exhibiting an example to discuss the application in physics of the mathematical structure in this paper .",
    "now i shortly call attention to some notations and rules , connected with symplectic space and orthogonal space , concurrence and magic basis , to prepare what follows below .      a vector space v ( we only limit to the finite dimensional vector spaces on the complex field c ) with a symmetric bilinear function @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13 is called an orthogonal space @xmath14 , and @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13 is called inner product of the orthogonal space .",
    "the operators which preserve this inner product are called orthogonal operators , all of which form orthogonal group . for any @xmath15 if @xmath16",
    "we say @xmath17 are orthogonal with respect to the inner product of @xmath14 .",
    "a basis of @xmath14 , @xmath18 , if satisfies @xmath19 , we call it orthonormal basis with respect to the inner product of ( regular ) orthogonal space .",
    "orthogonal operators transform the orthonormal basis to orthonormal basis .",
    "similarly , a vector space v with an antisymmetric bilinear function @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath20 is called a symplectic space @xmath21 , and @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath20 is called inner product of symplectic space .",
    "the operators which preserve this inner product are called symplectic operators , all of which form symplectic group . for any @xmath22 , if @xmath23 we say @xmath17 are orthogonal with respect to the inner product of symplectic space . a basis of @xmath21 , @xmath18 , if satisfies @xmath24 ( where @xmath25 when j - i=1 , otherwise @xmath26 ) , we call it orthonormal basis ( or symplectic basis ) with respect to the inner product of ( regular ) symplectic space .",
    "symplectic operators transform the orthonormal basis to orthonormal basis .",
    "obviously , the ( regular ) symplectic space must be even dimensional .",
    "wootters and hill obtained the analytical expression of eof for 2-qubit states . during their research , they made use of the spin - flip operator ( we use symbol `` - '' to denote it ) , concurrence , and magic basis .",
    "for 1-qubit pure states , the spin - flip operator is defined as @xmath27 , where * denotes complex conjugate , @xmath28 is the pauli operator . for 2-qubit pure states , the spin - flip operator defined as @xmath29 , and it can be naturally extended for n - qubit pure states , @xmath30 . for 2-qubit pure states , concurrence defined as @xmath31 . for 2-qubit systems , given a local basis @xmath32 , the so - called magic basis defined as @xmath33 an elegant result is , when we expand a 2-qubit pure state @xmath34 in the magic basis as @xmath35 , the concurrence of @xmath34 can then be expressed as @xmath36 in this paper , we will generalize eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) to n - qubit ( n even ) cases .",
    "in the two dimensional hilbert space @xmath37 of 1-qubit system , for a given local orthonormal ( with respect to the hilbert space ) basis @xmath38 , spin - flip operator is defined on this basis as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the imaginary unit , and @xmath41 .",
    "for any two pure states @xmath42 suppose @xmath43 @xmath44 since spin - flip operator is antilinear operator , then @xmath45 @xmath46 we define @xmath47 eq . ( 6 ) is antisymmetric bilinear with respect to @xmath48 , so @xmath37 with eq .",
    "( 6 ) becomes a symplectic space , we denote it @xmath49 .",
    "it is easy to verify , @xmath50 is the orthonormal basis with respect to both the hilbert space and the sympletic space , we call it bi - orthonormal basis . under this basis ,",
    "a symplectic operator s satisfies @xmath51 , where @xmath52 means matrix transpose .",
    "this condition is equivalent to dets=1 .",
    "so , it follows that the special complex group sl(2,c ) and symplectic group sp(1,c ) are homomorphic , @xmath53 all the bi - orthonormal basis of @xmath49 are @xmath54 for complex number @xmath55 , we define @xmath56 , then for any two pure states @xmath57 @xmath58 let @xmath59 denote all linear operators on @xmath37 .",
    "we also define the spin - flip operator on @xmath59 , which is antilinear , and for any @xmath60 @xmath61    under the definitions above , for any @xmath62 , @xmath60 @xmath63 we have the following properties @xmath64 @xmath65 @xmath66",
    "@xmath67 @xmath68 @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the identity operator of @xmath59 , @xmath71 means hermitian adjoint , @xmath72 the inverse .",
    "we use @xmath5 to denote the hilbert space of n qubits . now given a set of local orthonormal bases @xmath38 of each qubit , denote them by @xmath73 , or @xmath74 . for any @xmath75 , @xmath76 @xmath77 we have @xmath78 @xmath79    we found that , when n is even , eq . ( 18 ) is symmetric bilinear with respect to @xmath80 , so @xmath5 becomes an orthogonal space , we denote it by @xmath7 ; meanwhile , when n is odd , eq . ( 18 ) is antisymmetric bilinear with respect to @xmath81 , hence @xmath82 becomes symplectic space , we denote it by @xmath6 .",
    "some direct algebras will convince you that for n qubits cases also hold the properties similar to eqs .",
    "( 9)-(16 ) of 1 qubit .",
    "in addition , for local operations @xmath83 , which operate on individual qubit respectively , we have @xmath84",
    "suppose @xmath85 is a bi - orthonormal basis of @xmath86 that is , @xmath87 @xmath88 fix one @xmath89 then for any @xmath90 we have @xmath91 hence @xmath92 we expand @xmath90 in local basis @xmath93 ( denote it by @xmath94 then @xmath95 since @xmath96 we obtain @xmath97 @xmath98 then reads @xmath99=\\delta _ { jk},\\label{(21.a)}\\ ] ] where @xmath100 means that in the sum indices @xmath101 and @xmath102 only one appears .",
    "if we let @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the real number set , then eq . ( 21 ) and @xmath90 become @xmath105=\\delta _ { jk},\\ ] ] @xmath106.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we define the generalized magic basis as @xmath107,\\nonumber\\\\    \\rangle=\\frac i{\\sqrt{2}}[|\\alpha _ 1,\\alpha _ 2, ... ,\\alpha _ n\\rangle\\nonumber\\\\ -(-1)^{\\alpha _ 1+\\alpha _ 2+ ... +\\alpha _ n}i^n|\\alpha _ 1 + 1,\\alpha _ 2 + 1, ... ,\\alpha _ n+1\\rangle].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in eq . ( 24 ) , indices @xmath108 and @xmath109 only one appears .",
    "we see that eq .",
    "( 24 ) is just the generalization of eq .",
    "( 1 ) . combining eqs . ( 24 ) and ( 23 ) we obtain + * theorem 1 * : @xmath85 is a bi - orthonormal basis of @xmath7 if and only if it can be expressed as the generalized magic basis multiplied by a real orthogonal matrix .",
    "+      suppose local operation @xmath110 preserves the orthogonal inner product , i.e. , it is an orthogonal operator , so for any @xmath111 @xmath5 , @xmath112 according to eq . ( 19 ) , we have @xmath113 where , @xmath114 , @xmath115 @xmath116 are the identities of individual qubit space .",
    "it follows that @xmath83 are the symplectic operators of each @xmath117 . from eqs .",
    "( 7 ) and ( 14 ) , we obtain + * theorem 2 * : @xmath118 can be homomorphically mapped into @xmath119 ( n even)@xmath120 + a natural corollary of theorem 2 is : if two states of @xmath7 are connected by a operator which is not an orthogonal operator , then these two states can not be transformed by any local operation , i.e. , they are not in the same slocc class .",
    "suppose @xmath121 , or @xmath122 are the local bi - orthonormal bases of individual qubit , see eq .",
    "( 8) , thus @xmath123 @xmath124 these imply that the @xmath125 is exactly the bi - orthonormal basis of @xmath126 since unitary operators preserve the inner product of hilbert space , and symplectic operators preserve the inner product of symplectic space , then we have + * theorem 3 * : @xmath85 is a bi - orthonormal basis of @xmath6 if and only if it can be expressed as the basis @xmath127",
    "@xmath128 @xmath129 @xmath130 multiplied by a unitary - symplectic matrix ( i.e. , the matrix is both unitary and symplectic ) .",
    "+ similar to theorem 2 , we also have + * theorem 4 * : @xmath118 can be homomorphically mapped into @xmath131 ( n odd ) .",
    "+ similarly , a natural corollary of theorem 4 is : if two states of @xmath132 are connected by a operator which is not a symplectic operator , then these two states can not be transformed by any local operation , i.e. , they are not in the same slocc class .",
    "we introduced the symplectic space and orthogonal space of n qubits , this mathematical structure will bring conveniences for some problems . as an example , we consider the quadratic form @xmath133 in @xmath7 or @xmath6 .",
    "obviously , @xmath133 vanishes in @xmath6 .",
    "however , in @xmath7 , @xmath133 may not vanish .",
    "in fact the absolute values @xmath134 form an entanglement measure of @xmath34 @xcite , and it can be viewed as the formal generalization of 3-tangle @xcite .",
    "now we express @xmath135 through the bi - orthonormal basis of @xmath7 , an interesting result will occur .",
    "assume we expand @xmath34 in the bi - orthonormal basis @xmath136 as @xmath137 then we get @xmath138 eq . ( 25 ) is just the generalization of eq .",
    "we now use eq .",
    "( 25 ) to describe the maximally entangled states , i.e. , @xmath139 for normalized pure states @xmath140 .",
    "for this purpose , we first make a geometrical interpretation of eq .",
    "( 25 ) : we draw a polygonal line @xmath141 from o(0,0 ) on the complex plane such that @xmath142 @xmath143 , ... , @xmath144 then @xmath145 .",
    "point @xmath146 can not go beyond the unit circle , and the inequality @xmath147 holds .",
    "when @xmath146 is on the unit circle , @xmath34 is the maximally entangled state , in such case , the polygonal line @xmath141 becomes straight , with some calculations , we obtain + * theorem 5 * : suppose @xmath148 @xmath149 under local basis @xmath93 ( denote it by @xmath150 @xmath151 and under bi - orthonormal basis @xmath152 @xmath137 then the following below are equivalent    ( 1 ) .",
