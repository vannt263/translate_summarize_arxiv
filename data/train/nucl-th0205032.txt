    "present lattice qcd calculations indicate that strongly interacting hadronic matter at temperatures of 150 - 170 mev ( or energy densities of 1 - 2 gev/@xmath2 ) should undergo a phase transition to a new state of matter generally denoted as quark - gluon - plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "it is also common believe that this state of matter existed during the early phase of the universe until the temperature drop due to the rapid expansion lead to the freeze - out of hadrons which constitute a sizeable fraction of the total mass of the universe .",
    "whereas the big bang has only been a single event - for presently living observers - relativistic collisions of heavy nuclei offer the unique possibility to study the dynamics of a huge number of tiny bangs under well controlled laboratory conditions .",
    "hadronic spectra and relative hadron abundancies reflect the dynamics in the hot and dense zone formed in the early phase of the reaction .    whereas meson rapidity distributions and transverse mass spectra essentially reflect the dynamics of newly produced @xmath3 pairs , the baryon rapidity and transverse mass distributions give important information on baryon stopping @xcite whereas antibaryon abundancies shed some light on quark chemical potentials @xmath4 at the space - time points of chemical decoupling , i.e. when chemical reactions no longer occur due to a large average separation between the hadrons .",
    "the latter statement , however , only holds if an approximate chemical equilibrium is reached in the collision zone of nucleus - nucleus reactions . in fact , chemical equilibrium models  based on extrapolations of existing data at the ags and sps  suggest that the highest strange baryon abundancies should occur in central collisions of heavy nuclei between 20 and 40 a@xmath1gev @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the degree of baryon stopping is related ( by energy - momentum conservation ) to the number of newly produced hadrons @xmath5 ( per unit rapidity ) which can be used to extrapolate the achieved energy density in these collisions by adopting the bjoken formula @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the transverse ( geometrical ) overlap region , @xmath8 is the average transverse mass and @xmath9 the proper production time which is estimated to be in the order of 1 fm / c . according to ( [ bjor ] )",
    "the energy densities reached in central @xmath0 collisions at the sps  using experimental information on @xmath8 and @xmath10 should be in the order of 2.53.5 gev/@xmath2 , i.e. well above the critical energy density for a transition to a qgp in equilibrium .    the data from the sps on baryon stopping demonstrate that simple extrapolations from @xmath11 collisions at the same energy do not show enough baryon stopping ( cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite ) . here",
    "transport models employing hadronic and string degrees - of - freedom such as rqmd @xcite , urqmd @xcite or hsd @xcite do a better job since the formation and multiple rescattering of formed hadrons are included in these approaches .",
    "furthermore , such transport calculations allow to study the change in dynamics from elementary baryon - baryon or meson - baryon collisions to proton - nucleus reactions or from peripheral to central nucleus - nucleus collisions in a unique way without changing any parameter .",
    "this is of central importance since the prejudice of thermal and chemical equilibrium does not hold in all of these reactions and the transport studies allow to explore the amount of ( thermal or chemical ) equilibrium reached in such collisions @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the dynamics of heavy nucleus - nucleus collisions have been studied up to 11.6 a@xmath1gev at the bnl ags and an extensive program has been carried out at the top cern sps energy of 160 a@xmath1gev , whereas the intermediate range from 11 to 160 a@xmath1gev has been practically unexplored from the experimental side .",
    "only recently , experiments for @xmath12 collisions at 40 and 80 a@xmath1gev have been performed at the cern sps @xcite and further experimental measurements are expected at 20 a@xmath1gev @xcite . in this respect there is considerable hope that the experimental data can throw light on the basic question  if we might find signatures for an intermediate qgp state or if we just see strongly interacting hadronic matter .    in a previous study  within the urqmd approach  we have addressed pion , kaon and antikaon abundancies and spectra in central @xmath0 collisions from 20  160 a@xmath1gev in comparison to the data from the na49 collaboration @xcite . in general , we have found that the urqmd model reasonably describes the data , however , systematically overpedicts the @xmath13 yield by @xmath14% , whereas the @xmath15 yield is underestimated by @xmath16% .",
    "the @xmath17 yields are in a good agreement with the data for all energies .",
    "this suggests that the production of antistrange quarks ( @xmath18 ) might be somewhat low in the transport model ( as in the hsd approach @xcite ) whereas the production of the lightest @xmath3 pairs is overestimated systematically .",
    "however , in order to obtain a complete information on the abundancy of @xmath19 quarks one has to study strange baryon production and antihyperon production , too , since strangeness conservation implies the same amount of @xmath20 and @xmath18 quarks to be produced in the collision .",
    "it is the aim of this work to provide an answer to this question within nonequilibrium transport theory .",
    "the urqmd transport approach is described in refs .",
    "@xcite and includes all baryonic resonances up to an invariant mass of 2 gev as well as mesonic resonances up to 1.9 gev as tabulated in the pdg @xcite . for hadronic continuum excitations we employ a string model with meson formation times in the order of 1 - 2  fm / c depending on the momentum and energy of the created hadrons .",
    "the transport approach is matched to reproduce the nucleon - nucleon , meson - nucleon and meson - meson cross section data in a wide kinematical regime @xcite . at the high energies considered here the particles",
    "are essentially produced in primary high energetic collisions by string excitation and decay , however , the secondary interactions among produced particles ( e.g. pions , nucleons and excited baryonic and mesonic resonances ) also contribute to the particle dynamics  in production as well as in absorption .",
    "here we can come directly to the results for baryons and antibaryons and start at the highest bombarding energy of 160 a@xmath1gev .",
    "the comparison of the urqmd results on baryon stopping for the most central @xmath12 collisions at 160 a@xmath1gev to the na49 data @xcite has been reported previously in refs .",
    "@xcite . in fig .",
    "[ prot160 ] we compare the urqmd ( version 1.3 ) calculations for the net proton rapidity distribution @xmath21 to the most resent data from the na49 collaboration @xcite for 6 different centrality classes of @xmath0 collisions  from the most central ( bin 1 ) to the very peripheral collisions ( bin 6 ) .",
    "note , that the spectators are excluded from the calculated @xmath5 spectra in line with the experimental measurement .",
    "we find that the urqmd model overestimates the stopping for the most central rapidity bin , i.e. the data show a slight dip at midrapidity and a two peak stucture , which indicates that full stopping is not achieved at 160 a@xmath1gev even for this heavy system . on the other hand",
    ", it is quite remarkable that the hadron / string approach well reproduces the @xmath21 rapidity distributions as a function of centrality .",
    "we step on with the hyperon ( @xmath22 ) rapidity distributions at 40 , 80 and 160 a@xmath1gev in comparison to the data from na49 @xcite  fig .",
    "[ lamsps ] .",
    "the urqmd calculations show an increasing hyperon yield with bombarding energy essentially due to a broadening of the rapidity distribution , while the midrapidity distributions at 40 and 80 a@xmath1gev are practically the same .",
    "the data from the na49 collaboration show a decreasing hyperon yield at midrapidity with higher bombarding energy while suggesting a slightly larger width in @xmath5 .",
    "note , however , that the data at 160 a@xmath1gev correspond to 10% centrality whereas the lower energies are for 7% centrality , respectively .",
    "we mention that for 7% centrality our calculations at 160 a@xmath1gev roughly give the same @xmath22 yield at midrapidity than for the lower energies of 40 and 80 a@xmath1gev .",
    "it is not clear at present from the data , if the total integrated yields are compatible with our calculations .",
    "however , as demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , the urqmd model describes rather well the antikaon rapidity distributions from 40 ",
    "160 a@xmath1gev whereas the kaon rapidity distributions are underestimated by about 15% .",
    "consequently , by strangeness conservation , which is strictly fulfilled in the urqmd approach , the hyperon yield should also be underestimated slightly .",
    "we , furthermore , provide an overview on rapidity distributions of protons , neutral ( @xmath22 ) and charged hyperons ( @xmath23 ) at 40 , 80 and 160 a@xmath1gev from 7% or 5% central @xmath0 collisions within the urqmd model as well as predictions for 20 a@xmath1gev ( fig .",
    "[ p_bar ] ) , where experimental measurements will be taken in near future @xcite . whereas the net proton density at midrapidity decreases strongly with higher bombarding energy  which should be attributed to a lower amount of baryon stopping  the width in rapidity increases accordingly since the net @xmath21 number is a constant , if the produced meson system on average is charge neutral .",
    "the situation with strange baryons is different since a newly produced @xmath20-quark is contained in their wave function . in the urqmd transport model this leads to a much narrower rapidity distribution for strange baryons than for protons from 20  160 a@xmath1gev as seen from fig .",
    "[ p_bar ] .",
    "consequently , the @xmath24 ratio varies sensitively with rapidity .",
    "we continue with antibaryon production in central @xmath0 collisions at sps energies . since the final @xmath25 or @xmath26 rapidity distributions are sensitive to their annihilation cross section with nucleons , we first discuss the actual implementation of annihilation within urqmd . in this respect",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ antil - xs ] the annihilation cross section of @xmath27 and @xmath28 with nucleons as a function of the incident ( @xmath27 or @xmath29 ) momentum in the laboratory frame .",
    "the solid circles are the @xmath27 data from @xcite while the open squares correspond to the @xmath30 data from @xcite .",
    "the dashed line stands for the parametrization of the @xmath27 annihilation cross section used in urqmd while the short dashed and solid lines correspond to two different parametrizations of the @xmath31 annihilation cross section , which are both compatible to the experimental data ( open squares ) , however , involve quite different extrapolations to the low momentum regime .",
    "the parametrization-1 ( short dashed line ) assumes @xmath32 thus relating the different cross sections at the same invariant energy @xmath33 , which leads to a constant annihilation cross section for antilambdas at low momentum of @xmath34 55 mb ( default in urqmd ) .",
    "the parametrization-2 ( solid line ) instead assumes @xmath35 thus relating the different cross sections at the same laboratory momentum @xmath36 .",
    "we note again that the data on @xmath26 annihilation at high momenta are compatible with both parametrizations .",
    "the urqmd calculations of the antiproton ( @xmath27 ) rapidity distribution for 5% central @xmath12 collisions at 160 a@xmath1gev are shown in fig .",
    "[ pbar160 ] in comparison to the data from the na49 collaboration @xcite , which also include some contribution from the feeddown of @xmath26 and @xmath37 .",
    "the experimental distribution is underestimated severely in urqmd suggesting either a much lower annihilation cross section for antiprotons or the dominance of multi - meson fusion channels as suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite .    within the strangeness balance discussed in the context with figs . 2 and 3 ,",
    "the antistrangeness content of antihyperons ( @xmath38 ) has been neglected .",
    "this conjecture remains to be proven .",
    "in fact , as shown in fig . [ alamsps ] , the experimental data @xcite for central @xmath0 collisions at 80 a@xmath1gev give @xmath39 1 , which is within the experimental error bars for @xmath40 in fig .",
    "[ lamsps ] .",
    "this even more holds true at the lower bombarding energy of 40 a@xmath1gev .",
    "the urqmd calculations for the same centrality bin underestimate the na49 data @xcite by about of a factor of 2 ( for parametrization-1 ) or 3 ( for parametrization-3 ) at 40 and 80 a@xmath1gev whereas the data at 160 a@xmath1gev are underestimated only by about factors of 1.5 - 2 . the short - dashed line ( in the lower part for 160 a@xmath1gev )",
    "shows the result of a calculation without antihyperon annihilation which only slightly overestimates the data .",
    "when integrating over rapidity we find that in case of parametrization-1 about half of the antihyperons are annihilated whereas for the parametrizarion-2 @xmath412/3 of the antihyperons disappear .",
    "it has been shown previously in ref .",
    "@xcite that the standard urqmd model ( with parametrization-1 ) underestimates the ( multi-)strange baryon multiplicity for central @xmath12 at 160 a@xmath1gev . as argued in @xcite , the inclusion of non - hadronic medium effects , like color - ropes @xcite ( simulated in urqmd by increasing the string - tension ) , enhances the multiplicity of ( anti-)strange baryons . the missing antihyperon yield can be attributed also to multi - meson fusion channels involving @xmath42 mesons @xcite that are not accounted for in the calculations reported here .",
    "furthermore , the high abundance of @xmath43 and @xmath44 seen experimentally might also signal the appearance of disoriented chiral condensates ( dcc s ) as put forward by kapusta and wong @xcite . in short ,",
    "this issue is presently still open .    in order to provide an overview on antiproton and antihyperon production ( in analogy to fig .",
    "3 ) we show in fig .",
    "[ y - anti ] the rapidity distributions of antihyperons ( @xmath45 ) calculated within the urqmd model for 7% central @xmath12 collisions at 20 ( short dashed lines ) , 40 ( dot - dashed lines ) , 80 ( dashed lines ) and for 10% central ( @xmath45 ) and 5% central ( @xmath27 ) collisions at 160 a@xmath1gev ( solid lines ) .",
    "the upper plot corresponds to the parametrization-1 for @xmath30 annihilation cross section whereas the middle plot shows the urqmd results with the parametrization-2. the abundancy of strange antibaryons ( @xmath46 ) increases rapidly with bombarding energy .",
    "note , since the antihyperon yield is very low especially at 20 a@xmath1gev , we present the antihyperon rapidity distribution in a logarithmic scale and indicate the statistical errorbars in order to demonstrate the accuracy / statistics achieved in the urqmd calculations . as discussed above the antihyperon absorption is more pronounced for parametrization-2 especially at lower bombarding energy .",
    "we note in passing , taht the ( rapidity integrated ) @xmath47 ratio from the urqmd calculation is @xmath41 0.9 and 0.6 for all bombarding energies from 20 - 160 a@xmath1gev within the parameterset-1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "in summary , we have calculated the amount of baryon stopping in central @xmath0 collisions from 20  160 a@xmath1gev as well as hyperon rapidity distributions in comparison to experimental data at 40 , 80 and 160 a@xmath1gev taken recently by the na49 collaboration @xcite .",
    "we have demonstrated , furthermore , that the urqmd model reasonably reproduces the amount of baryon stopping at 160 a@xmath1gev for @xmath0 collisions as a function of centrality .",
    "the comparison of our calculations for hyperons with the experimental data , however , indicates that the strange baryon yield at midrapidity is slightly overestimated whereas the calculated rapidity distributions are somewhat more narrow than the data .",
    "this discrepancy might indicate a different mechanism for strange hyperon production than the string mechanism in the transport model . on the other hand , the experimental antihyperon rapidity distributions at 40 , 80 and 160 a@xmath1gev as well as the antiproton rapidity distribution at 160 a@xmath1gev",
    "are underestimated by up to factors of 3 which we address to missing multi - meson fusion channels @xcite in the urqmd model .",
    "note , however , that instead of multi - meson fusion channels also disoriented chiral condensates might explain the enhanced production of multistrange baryons as suggested in ref",
