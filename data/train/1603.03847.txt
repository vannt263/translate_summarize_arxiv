    "the fact that strong magnetic fields may be generated in peripheral heavy - ion collisions  @xcite and may also be present in magnetars  @xcite has motivated many recent investigations regarding the effects of a magnetic field in defining the boundaries of the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) phase diagram for recent reviews , see refs .  .",
    "in both situations , the magnitude of the magnetic fields is huge and may reach about @xmath5 and @xmath6 in each case respectively . in the case of heavy ion collisions ,",
    "the presence of a strong magnetic field most certainly plays a role despite the fact that , in principle , the field intensity should decrease very rapidly lasting for about 1 - 2 fm / c only  @xcite . the possibility that this short time interval may  @xcite or may not  @xcite be affected by conductivity remains under dispute . at  zero temperature ,",
    "the great majority of effective models for qcd are in agreement with respect to the occurrence of the phenomenon of magnetic catalysis ( mc ) , which refers to the increase of the chiral order parameter represented by the ( light ) quark condensates with the strenght @xmath1 of the magnetic field . on the other hand , at finite temperature",
    "such models fail to predict the inverse magnetic catalysis ( imc ) , an effect discovered by lattice qcd ( lqcd ) simulations  @xcite , in that the pseudo - critical temperature @xmath7 for chiral symmetry restoration decreases as @xmath1 increases .",
    "this failure has motivated a large body of work attempting to clarify the reasons for the observed discrepancy  @xcite . intuitively , it is natural to attribute the failure to the fact that most effective models lack gluonic degrees of freedom and so are unable to account for the back reaction of sea quarks to the external magnetic field . this implies , in particular , the absence of the asymptotic freedom ( af ) , a key feature of qcd that plays an important role in processes involving high temperatures and large baryon densities , and , of course , large magnetic fields .",
    "since long ago , af effects in effective models has been mimicked by making the coupling strength to decrease with the temperature and/or density according to some ansatz  @xcite .",
    "more recently , this very same strategy was adopted in the case of hot magnetized quark matter .",
    "in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the imc phenomenon found by lattice simulations was explained within the two - flavor nambu  jona - lasinio model ( njl ) if the coupling constant , @xmath0 , decreases with _ both _ the magnetic field strength and the temperature , simulating the effect of af in qcd .",
    "a similar mechanism was used with a @xmath8 polyakov - njl ( pnjl ) model , but with @xmath0 depending only on the magnetic field  @xcite which , however , leads to results in contradiction with lattice results , in that it leads to a non monotonic decrease of @xmath7 at high field values . in a very recent work  @xcite",
    ", an explicit calculation of the one - loop correction to the quark - gluon vertex has shown that competing effects between gluon and quark color charges , as in the phenomenon of asymptotic freedom , lead to the decrease of effective quark - gluon coupling with the magnetic field at finite temperatures .",
    "this certainly lends strong support to the idea  @xcite that the imc is due to the decrease of the effective coupling between quarks and gluons in the presence of magnetic fields at high temperatures .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate the implications of using a @xmath1 and @xmath2 modified njl coupling for thermodynamic quantities of magnetized quark matter .",
    "we are particularly interested in the qualitative changes that a @xmath3 causes in quantities very sensitive to the chiral transition , such as the speed of sound , thermal susceptibility and specific heat .",
    "this is an important open question since the interaction that is implied by a @xmath3 gives rise to a new phenomenology that has not been fully explored .",
    "initially we quantitatively refine the running of the coupling @xmath3 , proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , by accurately fitting results from recent lqcd calculations .",
    "we fit the lqcd results for the magnetized quark condensates with a simple formula for @xmath3 which is parametrized by four @xmath1-dependent coefficients .",
    "as we shall demonstrate , one of the main physical implications of using a @xmath3 is that the signatures associated with the chiral transition in thermodynamic quantities become more markedly defined as the field strength increases .",
    "also , our results for the pressure and magnetization are in line with lqcd predictions , which find that at a fixed temperature , these quantities always raise with @xmath1 .",
    "this behavior , especially close to the transition region , is not observed with the njl model with a @xmath1 and @xmath2 independent coupling  @xmath0 .    in the next section",

    "we close this section by remarking that , to the best of our knowledge , lqcd predictions for the @xmath119 case analyzed here are not available in the literature . then , one could argue that the use of the three flavor version of the njl model , which is tailormade to account for strangeness , would be more appropriate as far as numerical comparisons are concerned . in our opinion",
    "this is a legitimate concern and we also agree that the @xmath114 version is the one to be adopted in situations such as realistic astrophysical applications , where strangeness is important , or comparisons aiming to be in _ quantitative _ agreement with lqcd predictions for thermodynamical observables .",
    "nevertheless , we recall that our ansatz for the four - fermion vertex , @xmath0 , was obtained by fitting the lqcd results for the light quark sector which represents the relevant degrees of freedom regarding the chiral transition . as we have shown in the present section using this ansatz one retrieves , at least qualitatively , most lattice predictions for different thermodynamical quantities for the @xmath114 case improving over predictions made with a fixed coupling . in principle",
    "this encouraging result can be further generalized to furnish numerical results which agree _ quantitatively _ with the _ in silico _ simulations for three flavors .",
    "remark that the more sophisticated @xmath8 njl model possesses a six - fermion vertex characterized by another coupling ( @xmath120 ) which can also be considered to have a thermo - magnetic dependence .",
    "then , using this extra degree of freedom one could attempt to give a numerically more accurate description of the lqcd for @xmath114 as a ( consistent ) alternative to the simple approach adopted in ref .",
    "@xcite where the authors consider solely the coupling @xmath0 , only with a magnetic dependence , to describe all channels .",
    "we postpone this investigation to a future work .",
    "aiming to capture some aspects of qcd s asymptotic freedom phenomenon we have investigated the thermodynamics of hot and magnetized quark matter within the njl model using a coupling which runs with both the temperature and the magnetic field strength . by fitting the lqcd results for the quark condensates we were able to obtain a numerically accurate ansatz for the resulting coupling , @xmath3 , which was further employed to compute different thermodynamical quantities used to describe the chiral transition .",
    "therefore , the present application considerably extends and improves a previous work @xcite whose major goal was to reproduce the high-@xmath2 imc phenomenon from a qualitaive point of view .    our numerical results allows us to conclude that the use a coupling mimicking af alters significantly the behavior of the eos with respect to predictions performed with the standard fixed coupling .",
    "for instance , for any fixed temperature , quantities such as the pressure and the magnetization obtained with our @xmath3 always increase with @xmath1 , a result which appears to be consistent with lqcd predictions @xcite .",
    "another feature which gives further support to the use of @xmath3 is the observation that in this case the chiral transition appears to happen in a more dramatic fashion and the peaks of quantities such as the entropy density increase considerably with @xmath1 which , once again , is an outcome characteristic of lqcd simulations often missed within standard njl applications .",
    "in summary we have shown that the njl model can be patched in order to accurately reproduce imc which is observed to take within the chiral transition of hot and magnetized quark matter .",
    "in particular , our eq .",
    "( [ ourgbt ] ) represents an ansatz for @xmath3 which can be promptly implemented to improve njl model applications .    finally , we point out that the non monotonic decrease of @xmath7 at @xmath121 values observed in ref .",
    "@xcite where @xmath0 was taken to depend on @xmath1 only is perhaps due to the fact that the correct running was not properly taken into account since within qcd the temperature also represents an energy scale and the coupling constant still runs with @xmath2 when @xmath68 .",
    "so , in principle , purely thermal effects should also influence this parameter as well as the six - fermion coupling , @xmath120 , whose running has been neglected in ref .",

    "our results show that to have a consistent monotonic decrease of @xmath7 with @xmath1 it is crucial to consider a @xmath123 dependent coupling which seems to be consistent with the findings of ref .",

    "<S> different thermodynamic quantities of magnetized quark matter evaluated with a @xmath4 are compared with the ones obtained at constant coupling @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the model with a @xmath3 predicts a more dramatic chiral transition as the field intensity increases . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the pressure and magnetization always increase with @xmath1 for a given temperature . </S>",
    "<S> being parametrized by four magnetic field dependent coefficients and having a rather simple exponential thermal dependence our accurate ansatz for the running coupling can be easily implemented to improve typical model applications to magnetized quark matter . </S>"
