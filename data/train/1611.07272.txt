    "perception is the subjective experience that results from the entire brain , not just photoreceptors .",
    "color discrimination tasks rely on the ability to detect small differences in the activity of higher brain areas when two stimuli of similar chromatic composition are presented .",
    "human color discrimination ability has been measured by several authors with behavioral experiments first performed by wright and pitt ( 1934 ) . in these studies ,",
    "a bipartite field was presented to a human subject .",
    "one half of the field , here called the _ reference _ field , was illuminated by a monochromatic beam , constructed by filtering a broad - band light source .",
    "the second half , the _ test _ field , was also monochromatic , and its wavelength was controlled by the observer .",
    "initially , the two beams had the same wavelength and luminosity . the observer was instructed to displace the wavelength of the test field , until the first noticeable difference in hue was perceived . at this point ,",
    "the difference @xmath1 between the reference and test wavelengths was calculated .",
    "this difference constitutes the discrimination error , that is , the interval in wavelengths below which the two colors can not be perceptually discriminated .",
    "the discrimination error was reported to be a w - shaped function of wavelength , as displayed in fig.[f1]a ( wright and pitt 1934 ; pokorny and smith , 1970 ) .",
    "different curves correspond to different subjects .",
    "for all subjects , discrimination errors were large towards the two borders of the visible spectrum , and at around 550 nm , roughly at the center of the visible spectrum where luminosity sensitivity is maximal ( sharpe et al . 2005 ) . at short wavelengths ,",
    "the data show some variability across subjects . we have therefore separated the 9 curves into 3 groups ( displayed in different panels ) , depending on whether the discrimination error exhibited an additional maximum at approximately 450 nm ( top panel ) , only a shoulder ( middle panel ) , or a monotonic behavior ( bottom panel ) .    in 1942 ,",
    "david macadam ( 1942 ) broadened these discriminability experiments testing the ability to distinguish any two neighboring points in the entire color space , not just the subset of light beams composed of a single wavelength .",
    "the concept of color , in fact , can not be restricted to wavelength .",
    "blends of wavelengths produce a new chromatic sensation that emerges exclusively from the mixture , the hue of which differs from the hues of the individual components . in order to test human chromatic discrimination ability in the entire color space ,",
    "macadam measured ellipses in the cie 1931 @xmath2 chromaticity diagram , here shown in fig .",
    "points in this space represent hue and saturation , and are independent of the total luminosity .",
    "each ellipse in the diagram indicates the area in color space ( multiplied by 10 , for better visualization ) inside which two different stimuli can not be discriminated .    in this study",
    ", we test how much of the results in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] can be explained from a given noise model .",
    "the basic assumption is that two colors can be discriminated when the trial - to - trial variability of their neural representations is smaller than the difference of the corresponding means .",
    "the discriminability @xmath3 of two colors is proportional to the square root of the fisher information ( seung and sompolinsky , 1993 ) .",
    "the fisher information , in turn , introduces a notion of distance in color space .",
    "hence , our working hypothesis is that two colors become distinguishable when the fisher distance between them is larger than a given fixed minimum : the detection threshold .",
    "fisher information has been successfully used as a tool to disclose computational strategies in the nervous system for decades ( see for example abbot and dayan 1999 , dayan and abbot 2001 , brunel and nadal 1998 ) and continues to be widely employed ( ganguli and simoncelli 2014 , wei and stocker 2015 ) . within the fisher framework , two previous studies ( clark and skaff 2009 ; zhaoping et al .",
    "2011 ) have derived the discrimination accuracy expected by an ideal observer that only has access to the number of photons absorbed by the three types of cones .",
    "both studies were restricted to light beams composed of a single wavelength , and succeeded in explaining the w - shaped function of fig .",
    "our starting point is the work of zhaoping et al .",
    "we first express the main result of their work in terms of an analytical expression for the discrimination error .",
    "we use the theory to speculate how putative tetrachromat subjects perceive the chromatic space . in the case of trichromats",
    ", we interpret the subject - to - subject variations in fig .",
    "[ f1]a as resulting from the reported variability in the composition of the human retina .",
    "more importantly , we derive new information - theoretical tools that expand the analysis to the entire chromatic space , beyond monochromatic light beams . by considering mixtures of wavelengths ,",
    "we provide a theoretical framework to also explain fig .",
    "[ f1]b . by focusing our attention on the curved border of the chromatic space of fig .",
    "[ f1]b , we also recover the previous result with monochromatic light beams of fig .",
    "[ f1]a .",
    "our analysis concludes that 87% of the variance of macadam s data can be explained by properties of photoreceptors alone .",
    "discrimination errors reported in behavioral experiments are the result of the entire chain of hue - dependent computations intervening in chromatic perception .",
    "therefore , the agreement between experiment and theory implies that the bottleneck in chromatic information processing seems to be mainly determined by photoreceptor activity .",
    "subsequent encoding stages either operate optimally or , if they do not , loose information in a color - independent manner .",
    "color is the subjective sensation that results when a light beam of spectrum @xmath4 impinges the eye .",
    "the set of all possible spectra has infinite dimension , since for a continuum of wavelengths @xmath5 the intensity @xmath4 can vary arbitrarily . the human visual system , however , is insensitive to most of these dimensions .",
    "classical behavioral color - matching experiments demonstrated that for most observers , three monochromatic light sources , conveniently mixed , suffice to reproduce all visible colors .",
    "therefore , the human visual system projects the space of all possible spectra on a 3-dimensional subspace .",
    "all spectra sharing the same projection are metamers , that is , are perceived as indistinguishable . to represent colors as 3-dimensional vectors , here we use the coordinates @xmath6 defined in the cie 1931 ( appendix a1 ) . when two color vectors @xmath7 and @xmath8 only differ in their length ( they are proportional to one another ) , they share the same hue and saturation , and can only be distinguished by their luminosity . in some applications , it is desirable to discard the luminosity dimension , and only retain the two remaining features .",
    "the cie 1931 meeting also established a convention to carry out this reduction , by transforming the coordinates @xmath6 into a new set of coordinates @xmath9 defined by @xmath10    the components @xmath11 and @xmath12 do not vary if @xmath13 and @xmath14 are all multiplied by the same factor , so @xmath11 and @xmath12 no longer contain the luminosity dimension .",
    "the variable @xmath15 is associated with the sensation of brightness , since for monochromatic spectra , the wavelength dependence of @xmath15 closely resembles the apparent luminosity curve ( sharpe et al , 2005 ) .",

    "more quantitatively , the obtained @xmath113 value implies that the theory explains 87% of the variability of the experimental data .",
    "here we derived a metric in color space from a noise model of the representation of color in the brain .",
    "several classical studies have derived the minimal discrimination ellipses from line elements ( wyszecki and stiles , 2000 ) .",
    "those theories used heuristic arguments to propose a distance in color space .",
    "not being framed in the fisher geometry , they do not entail a data processing inequality nor a cramr - rao bound .",
    "the advantage of the fisher metric is that it brings along a rigorous mathematical framework , first , for deriving the metric from a noise model , and then , for transforming the metric from one space to another .",
    "given the noise model , the fisher metric is undisputable .",
    "of course , there are many candidate noise models , depending on which neuronal processes are described .",
    "the confrontation of the derived fisher ellipses with experimental data actually provides a systematic way to evaluate the adequacy of alternative noise models .",
    "here we offer an attempt to perform such confrontation , using one particular noise model based on the sole description of the photon absorption process .",
    "we conclude that a simple poisson model of the statistics of photoreceptor absorption account for @xmath120% of the variance of the behavioral results in the @xmath2 chromatic space .",
    "our theory also predicts that the minimal discrimination error is inversely proportional to the square root of the light intensity , following a rose - devries law , originally reported in contrast discrimination thresholds at low light intensities ( rose 1948 , devries 1943 ) , and later confirmed for chromatic discrimination experiments ( rovamo et al 2001 ) .",
    "experiments show that this dependence holds in the low - intensity photopic regime , but loses validity as the light intensity becomes larger ( rovamo et al 2001 ) .",
    "therefore , additional optic or neural color - dependent processing stages not contained in the poisson photoreceptor model must come into play at high intensities .    in spite of having neglected all subsequent color processing stages beyond absorption , even the voltage variations in the inner segments of photoreceptors , the distances derived from the fisher approach reproduce a large fraction of the experimental variability .",
    "the derived ellipses are only guaranteed to coincide with the measured discrimination error when the cramr - rao bound is tight , that is , when further processing stages perform optimally , or at least , they do not introduce additional color - dependent distortions . a priori , there is no reason to believe that such should be the case .",
    "the similarity between the theoretical and the experimental results therefore suggests that photon absorption constitutes the crucial stage in the chromatic dependence of color processing ability , and it suffices to explain most of the structure observed in experimental data .",
    "all subsequent processing stages either perform optimally or , if they lose information , they do so in a color - independent manner .",
    "the cramr - rao bound of eq .",
    "[ e : cramer ] is only valid for unbiased estimators , a more complex formula is required in the biased case ( cover and thomas , 1991 ) .",
    "however , in the presence of achromatic backgrounds ( as in all experiments explored here ) , discrimination errors have been always reported to have zero mean , so we work under the assumption that the nervous system is able to implement at least one unbiased estimator , for which eq .  [",
    "e : cramer ] holds .",
    "different is the case where the target and test stimuli are presented against a chromatic background , where subjects have been reported to bias their estimation of the target stimulus away from the hue of the background ( see for example klaue and wachtler 2015 ) . in such cases , we suspect that the more complex form of the cramr - rao bound should be employed .",
    "the fisher tensor determines the distance between neighboring colors ; the distance between distant colors must be calculated by adding the infinitesimal distances encountered along a specific path .",
    "if one of the two colors lies at a border of the chromatic space , the path must be entirely contained inside the space .",
    "when the path connecting two colors is short , all the involved infinitesimal distances are obtained from essentially the same fisher tensor , since the fisher metric varies smoothly with location . when comparing the theoretical and experimental ellipses , we have assumed that the fisher distance between the central color and the ellipse could be calculated with a single fisher tensor : the one of the center .",
    "to assess the validity of the approximation , we verified that inside each ellipse the eigenvalues of the theoretical fisher tensor vary at most 1.27 % , and the inclination angle at most @xmath121 ( recall that all depicted ellipses have been enlarged 10 times in each dimension , for better visibility ) .",
    "we are aware of two other previous studies where chromatic discrimination ability was modeled by information - theoretical methods .",
    "the first one ( clark and skaff , 2009 ) was based on stronger assumptions as the ones used here , since the properties of chromatic perception were explained in terms of a specific decoding process that takes place ( explicitly or implicitly ) in the visual system .",
    "our work neither supports nor refutes the proposed decoding , we simply show that it is not strictly required to explain a large fraction of the variance in human discrimination ability .",
    "the second study was developed by zhaoping et al .",
    "their approach was the starting point for the present study .",
    "they also discussed how the fisher metric varies with mean light intensity .",
    "instead here , we have focused on ( a ) providing an analytical formula for the monochromatic case , ( b ) extending the analysis to the whole chromatic space , and ( c ) discussing the discrimination ability of observers endowed with different retinal compositions .",
    "chromatic discrimination ability is limited by the imprecision with which neighboring colors are represented in the brain .",
    "the stochasticity considered here regards the unpredictability of the exact proportion of photons captured by @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath20 cones , given that the three absorption curves overlap with each other .",
    "the variance of @xmath122 is @xmath123 , and is maximal when both @xmath124 and @xmath125 are far from zero . for @xmath35 and @xmath20 cones ,",
    "this condition is met at approximately 550 _ nm _ , where both absorption probabilities are high .",
    "human color discrimination error has a local maximum at @xmath126 550 _ nm _ , roughly coinciding with the wavelength where humans perceive maximal luminosity ( sharpe et al . 2005 ) .",
    "so far , this coincidence appeared as incidental .",
    "an analysis of the equations involved in our study , however , reveals that color discrimination ability is determined by the derivative of the quantal cone fundamentals : the larger the derivative , the larger the value of the fisher information ( dayan and abbott , 2001 ) .",
    "since @xmath20 and @xmath35 cone fundamentals are very similar , and given that the variance is particularly large at @xmath126 550 _ nm _ , the two maxima can not be separated apart , and discrimination error peaks at a wavelength that is approximately the average of the wavelengths where @xmath20 and @xmath35 absorption curves reach their maxima .",
    "the coincidence , hence , is grounded on the mathematical properties of the fisher information .",
    "if the number of @xmath34 cones is large enough , a local maximum in discrimination error is also achieved at the wavelength where the s - cone absorption curve peaks , @xmath126 450 _",
    "nm_. moreover , the theory also predicts how discrimination ability varies with retinal composition , suggesting that the variability in anatomical properties of different observers may account for the variability in the experimental data .    throughout our work , we have only considered cones , although rod absorption is also modulated by wavelength . by a simple extension of our analysis ,",
    "it is also possible to include rods in the evaluation of chromatic discrimination ability .",
    "however , since rods and cones have different luminosity sensitivity , the comparison with behavioral data should be performed with experiments where the total light intensity was controlled .",
    "the parameters @xmath26 scaling the relevance of each photoreceptor should also include a factor accounting for the different cross sections of rods and cones , and their differential sensitivity depending on the total luminosity .",
    "the analysis presented here is only valid for photopic illumination conditions ( as reported by the experiments ) where rods are assumed to be saturated .",
    "extensions to other models , including rods or other optical and neural processes , are possible .",
    "results can be expressed in the classical color spaces employed here , through the transformation formulas of sect .",
    "[ geometry ] .",
    "from the physical point of view , the spectrum @xmath4 provides a complete characterization of a light beam .",
    "the space of all possible spectra has infinite dimensions .",
    "color matching experiments performed by helmholtz and young proved that by adjusting the intensity of three monochromatic sources of fixed wavelengths , human trichromats construct a beam that they perceive as visually indistinguishable from a target light source of arbitrary spectrum .",
    "hence , the human visual system projects the high - dimensional space of all possible spectra onto three dimensions ( fig .",
    "[ f2 ] ) .",
    "when the target light source is monochromatic and has wavelength @xmath5 , the three intensities required to construct the mixture define the color matching functions @xmath127 and @xmath128 , whose functional shape depends on the wavelengths of the three sources than comprise the mixture .",
    "the matching operation is linear , implying that the visual appearance of an arbitrary spectrum @xmath4 is governed by three numbers , defined as @xmath129 if the wavelengths of the three fixed light sources are varied , the shape of the color matching functions changes .",
    "different @xmath130 representations have thus appeared , depending on the chosen wavelengths .",
