    "the study of electron transport in non - polar liquids is of fundamental interest for understanding the dynamics of electronic processes in liquids and disordered systems , including dynamic and scattering processes .",
    "more recently , attention has focussed on applications including liquid state electronics , driven by use in high - energy particle detectors such as the liquid argon time projection chamber ( lartpc ) .",
    "advances in the fields of plasma discharges in liquids and associated electrical breakdowns ( see e.g. the review of bruggmen @xcite ) are dependent on a fundamental knowledge of charged particle transport in liquids . furthermore , the rapidly developing interdisciplinary field of plasma medicine requires @xcite a detailed knowledge of electron transport through liquid water and other biostructures , typically under non - equilibrium conditions .",
    "the study of excess electrons in dense gases and fluids is a complex problem , requiring the inclusion of many effects that are not present in dilute gaseous systems .",
    "the major contributions to these effects arise from the small interparticle spacings and their highly correlated separations . for thermal energies ,",
    "the de broglie wavelengths of the excess electrons are often orders of magnitude larger than the interatomic spacing , which leads to significant quantum - like effects . even within a semi - classical picture , where the excess electrons are assumed to act as point - like particles , no particular volume is `` owned '' by a single atom .",
    "this means the typical picture for transport in a gas , i.e. a series of individual collision events separated by the mean - free path , is no longer valid , making it important to consider multiple scattering effects of the electron from many atoms simultaneously .",
    "of particular note is the effect of `` coherent scattering '' and the pair correlations of the liquid play a very important role in this and other effects .",
    "many previous calculations for electrons in dense systems have neglected these liquid effects for simplicity , modelling dense fluids by applying a theory for dilute gases with only an appropriate increase of the density . however , a few alternative theories exist that have explored liquids in different ways .",
    "borghesani et al  @xcite have heuristically combined the liquid effects identified above to obtain an effective cross - section . when used in the standard equations from kinetic theory for mobility in a non - zero field ,",
    "their results have been shown to be remarkably accurate .",
    "braglia and dallacasa @xcite have derived a theory that addresses both enhancements and reductions to the zero - field mobility through a green s function approach with appropriate approximations to the self - energy but do not go beyond linear response theory and hence do not explain non - equilibrium behaviour at high fields .",
    "in contrast to the above approaches , the seminal articles by lekner and cohen @xcite outline a method to address effects of a dense fluid from an ab initio approach by appropriate modifications of the microscopic processes .",
    "the article by lekner @xcite describes how an effective potential for a single collision event can be built up from knowledge of only the single - atom / electron potential and the pair correlator of the fluid as well as prescribing a method for obtaining effective cross - sections from this potential .",
    "the article by cohen and lekner @xcite then describes how the effects of coherent scattering can be included with these effective cross - sections in a boltzmann equation solution for the calculation of transport properties .",
    "sakai et al @xcite have been able to improve agreement with experiment by empirically modifying the resultant cross - sections of the cohen and lekner formalism and by including inelastic processes .",
    "atrazhev et al @xcite were able to simplify the arguments of lekner @xcite to argue that , for small energies , the effective cross - section becomes dependent on the density only and obtained good agreement with experiment .",
    "however the distance at which to enforce this new behaviour of the effective cross - section remains a free parameter in the theory and this constant effective cross - section must be found empirically .",
    "atrazhev and co - workers went on to consider the interaction as a muffin tin potential , with each cell being a wigner - seitz sphere surrounding each atom in the liquid .",
    "they used a variable phase function method which could describe the absence of a ramsauer minimum in the liquid cross - section along with density fluctuations of the liquid @xcite .",
    "the calculations we present in this paper are based on a generalization of the cohen and lekner formalism , overcoming several approximations which are no longer necessary in modern day transport and scattering theory .",
    "with regard to the scattering potential , lekner @xcite used the buckingham polarization potential @xcite as input , which we will show is completely inadequate due to its omission of the exchange interaction .",
    "this is not noticeable for gas phase measurements , due to the fitting parameter of the buckingham potential , but shows significant differences after the liquid modifications are applied . by performing a detatiled analysis of the partial phase shifts , atrazhev and co - workers @xcite",
    "were able to isolate the important properties of the potential which are required for accurate determination of the transport properties .",
    "our calculations instead avoid these difficulties by using accurate forms for the electron - atom interaction .",
    "with regard to the transport theory itself , we employ a previously derived extension of the cohen and lekner formalism for the boltzmann equation from a two - term to a full multiterm treatment of the velocity distribution function @xcite .",
    "this theory utlises the full anisotropic detail of the cross - sections that is available in our calculations . for dilute gaseous systems",
    ", the two - term approximation can be in serious error @xcite , and in this study we consider contributions to the error arising from the neglect of the full anisotropy in both the velocity distribution function and the differential scattering cross - section for liquid systems .",
    "we perform calculations specifically for the noble gas of argon , which is an excellent test bed for new theories due to the good availability of experimental data and the high degree of accuracy to which ab initio calculations can model the gaseous phase .",
    "available experimental data include drift velocities and characteristic energies in both the gas and liquid phases , as well as precise single - atom cross - sections .",
    "we emphasize that we are interested in the full non - equilibrium description of the transport properties and not only that of zero - field mobilities , and so we must consider the full range of the static structure factor @xmath0 instead of @xmath1 which is fixed by the isothermal compressibility .    in the following sections we consider the calculation of the macroscopic swarm transport properties in the gaseous and liquid environments from the microscopic cross - sections , modified by the screening and coherent scattering effects discussed above .",
    "we first detail the calculation of the gas phase cross - sections in section [ sec : gas_scattering ] , using accurate potentials in the dirac - fock scattering equations and then address , in section [ sec : screening - of - the ] , effects of screening in the liquid .",
    "the transition from a gas to liquid requires a modification of the scattering to include an effective scattering potential and an effective non - local exchange term which we describe in section [ sec : effective - potential - in ] .",
    "the application of these cross sections in structured media is outlined in section [ transporttheory-1 ] and we present the results of our transport calculations in section [ sec : results ] . initially in section [ sub : electrons - in - gaseous ] we consider only the gas phase , understanding the importance of an accurate treatment of exchange and polarization and thereby establishing the credibility of the initial gas - phase potential subsequently used as input for the calculation of cross - sections for the liquid phase environment .",
    "transport coefficients calculated using the screened cross - sections and associated coherent scattering effects are considered in section [ sub : electrons - in - liquid ] , where they are compared with the available measured transport data . throughout this paper",
    "we will make use of atomic units ( @xmath2 ) unless otherwise specified .",
    "the core of a transport calculation is based on an accurate description of the scattering of the electron off a particle in the bulk .",
    "effective interaction potentials are often used to determine various measurable properties , such as scattering lengths or polarizabilities .",
    "these effective potentials are successful so long as they correctly reproduce these quantities for input in other simulations . however , as mentioned above , there are many additional effects due to a dense gas or liquid which can modify the details of the scattering processes .",
    "hence , we require a potential that does not only produce the correct scattering properties in the dilute limit but also well describes the scattering properties under a perturbation of the potential .",

    "the polarization can be accounted for by means of long - range multipole polarization potentials while the exchange interaction is represented most accurately by a short - range non - local potential formed by antisymmetrizing the total scattering wavefunction .    in the present work the scattering of the incident electrons , with wavenumber @xmath3 , by argon atoms",
    "is described in the gaseous phase by the integral formulation of the partial wave dirac - fock scattering equations ( see @xcite for details ) . in matrix form , these equations can be written as @xmath4 & \\;,\\label{eq : dirac_eqn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the local potential @xmath5 is given by the sum of the static and local polarization potentials i.e. , @xmath6 and @xmath7 and @xmath8 represent the large and small components of the exchange interaction . in equation  ,",

    "the exact form of the definite integral @xmath29 and the indefinite integral @xmath30 are given in equations  ( 11 ) and  ( 12 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we note that the dependence of the exchange terms on the wave function requires an iterative solution for equation .    in the integral equation formulation",

    "neither the polarization nor the exchange interaction alone is capable of reproducing the true ramsauer minimum in the argon momentum transfer cross - section ; it is only when we combine these two interactions that there is agreement with experiment .",
    "this is also true for the ramsauer minimum in the elastic cross - section .    in the original work of @xcite",
    ", lekner described the elastic scattering of electrons by argon atoms by just the local dipole polarization potential of buckingham @xcite which is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the static dipole polarizability of argon and @xmath42 is an adjustable parameter .",
    "lekner chose this parameter so as to obtain the experimental scattering length of  @xcite .",
    "this value is very close to the current recommended value of of @xcite .",
    "the value obtained in the current work is    as a consequence of lekner s choice for the adjustable parameter @xmath42 , his simple polarization potential in equation   was able to mimic the effects of both the polarization and exchange interactions at low energies of the incident electron and his calculation was able to produce a low - energy ramsauer minimum in the momentum transfer cross - section . at higher energies his momentum transfer cross - section deviates from the experimental cross - section .",
    "cross - sections for electron scattering from argon .",
    "the calculations described in this paper , which use the non - local exchange interaction ( solid line ) are in good agreement with the recommended set of buckman et al .",
    "a comparison with a calculation similar to that of lekner @xcite using a buckingham potential ( dotted line ) shows loose qualitative agreement at the ramsauer minimum , but quantitatively is incorrect .",
    "also shown are the results from using two different effective models of a local exchange potential ( thick dashed @xcite and dash - dotted lines @xcite ) which do not agree with experimental measurement at all , as well as the cross - section when exchange is included but polarization is neglected ( thin dashed line).,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    we show our cross - sections calculated using ( [ eq : el_cs_def ] ) in figure  [ fig : cross_sections ] .",
    "we obtain very good agreement with the recommended set of cross - sections of @xcite which combine many different experimental measurements and theoretical calculations . in order to demonstrate the importance of including the non - local exchange interaction , we have also repeated the calculation using two different model potentials that replace the non - local exchange with an effective local term in the potential @xcite .",
    "one of these local approximations @xcite is qualitatively wrong , showing the same behaviour as that without exchange .",
    "the other approximation @xcite is qualitatively similar but differs in the scattering length and position of the ramsauer minimum by an order of magnitude .",
    "it is clear to see that there is a significant difference between the results .",
    "when we compare our results to those of the buckingham potential , where we set @xmath43  a.u .",
    "such that the scattering length is @xmath44  a.u .",
    ", we find that it does follow the general shape of the ramsauer minimum .",
    "however , we emphasize that this is a result of the fitting parameter @xmath45 and this potential does not accurately describe the details of the scattering .",
    "the effects of the high density of the liquid are included in our calculations by several modifications of the gas scattering properties .",
    "the first of these is to account for the screening of a single induced atomic dipole by the induced dipoles of all other atoms .",
    "our procedure outlined in this section closely follows that of lekner @xcite .    in the dilute gas limit ,",
    "the mobile electron undergoes a collision with a single atom of the gas effectively in isolation from all other atoms in the gas . during this collision",
    "the electron induces a set of multipole moments in the atom , which in turn interact with the electron through a charge - multipole potential , resulting in the polarization potential , @xmath46 , of section [ sec : gas_scattering ] above . for a dilute gas",
    ", the range of the potential produced by these induced multipole moments is relatively small compared with the large interatomic spacing and so it is a good approximation to neglect their effect on other atoms . however , with higher densities of the gas or liquid , many atoms can have a non - negligible induced set of multipole moments originating from both the mobile electron and from all other atoms in the bulk .",
    "the effective charge - multipole polarization potential felt by the electron at any particular location @xmath47 is then the sum of the polarization potentials from all atoms .",
    "we consider effects originating from the induced dipoles of the atoms only and determine the effective polarization of an individual atom self - consistently .",
    "we first assume that the induced dipole strength for every atom in the bulk can be written as @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the distance of the electron from the atom , @xmath50 is the exterior dipole polarizability ( see @xcite , equation ( 1 ) ) for a single atom that results from the interaction with the electron , and @xmath51 accounts for polarization screening which must be determined .",
    "this simple multiplicative factor is valid , so long as we average over the atomic distribution . in the dilute - gas limit , we can safely approximate @xmath52 , and in the dense case we must obtain a self - consistent expression for @xmath51 . by choosing a particular `` focus atom '' @xmath53 at location @xmath54 such that @xmath55 , and assuming that the coefficient @xmath51 is known for all other atoms , which we denote by @xmath56 , we can calculate @xcite the dipole strength for atom @xmath53 from : @xmath57 which has been obtained using bipolar coordinates , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the density of the bulk , @xmath61 is the isotropic pair correlator of the bulk and the factor @xmath62 arises due to the form of the electric field of a dipole .",
    "the integrations over @xmath58 and @xmath59 represent the contribution from an atom located at a distance @xmath58 from atom @xmath53 and a distance @xmath59 from the electron .",
    "the likelihood of finding an atom is determined by @xmath61 and so it can be seen that equation ( [ eq : dipole_selfcon ] ) approximates the exact polarization by that resulting from the ensemble average of all atomic configurations , given that one atom is located at @xmath54 . in this approximation ,",
    "the polarization itself is always aligned along the vector @xmath63 between the focus atom and the electron .",
    "the self - consistent solution to equation ( [ eq : dipole_selfcon ] ) is obtained by setting @xmath64 and solving for @xmath65 , which we do by iteration .",
    "the most important quantity in equation ( [ eq : dipole_selfcon ] ) is the pair correlator , which represents the next order in the particle distribution in the bulk beyond the average density . in the calculation of lekner ,",
    "the pair correlator was taken to be the analytical solution of the percus - yevick model for ease of calculation . in our calculation",
    ", we go beyond this by using the experimental measurements of yarnell @xcite to more accurately describe the correlations .",
    "the data we use , which was obtained for a bulk density of @xmath66 , is shown in figure  [ fig : pair_correlator ] and compared with the percus - yevick model at the same density .",
    "pair correlator for argon , as reported in yarnell @xcite , measured in neutron scattering experiments .",
    "also plotted , is the pair correlator calculated in the analytical percus - yevick approximation as used by lekner @xcite.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    using the pair correlator of argon , we have self - consistently calculated the screening function @xmath51 and show the result in figure  [ fig : screening_func ] .",
    "although this screening factor technically applies to the dipole term only , we work with a rather more complicated form of the polarization term than lekner had originally considered . however , as the largest contribution to the polarization does indeed come from the dipole term , we have decided to apply the screening factor @xmath51 to the entire polarization potential . hence , with the screening of the polarization taken into account , the screened polarization potential , @xmath67 , of an electron with one atom in a dense fluid is given by : @xmath68 we note that , in contrast to lekner , who used only the static dipole polarizability @xmath69 , the more accurate representation of the atom - electron interaction as described in section [ sec : gas_scattering ] has already led to a radial dependence of the polarization potential @xmath70 beyond that of a potential whose asymptotic behaviour is @xmath71 . the effect of the screening has hence led to a further modification of @xmath70 which is density dependent .    the screening function @xmath51 of the polarization interaction potential for scattering of an electron from a single argon atom in a bulk of density .,scaledwidth=60.0% ]",
    "for input into the kinetic theory , we require appropriate cross - sections for the scattering of the electron from a single `` focus atom '' in the bulk .",
    "as discussed above , the presence of the other atoms screens the polarization interaction between the electron and the focus atom .",
    "however , there is another more obvious effect resulting from the other atoms in the bulk : their interaction with the electron itself remains significant even when the electron is very close to the focus atom .",
    "hence , as outlined in lekner @xcite , we build up an effective potential that is experienced by the electron throughout a single scattering event , as well as define what is meant by `` a single scattering event '' .",
    "although we follow the general principles of @xcite , we calculate the cross - sections in a distinctly different fashion .",
    "the effective potential that we consider @xmath72 is made of two parts : @xmath73 which corresponds to the direct interactions with the focus atom , and @xmath74 , which corresponds to the interaction of the electron with the rest of the bulk . as it is prohibitively expensive to treat exact configurations of atoms in the bulk",
    ", we build the external potential @xmath75 by again taking the ensemble average : @xmath76 where the order of integration has been reversed in comparison to ( [ eq : dipole_selfcon ] ) for numerical convenience . ) , it is possible to precompute the innermost integral cumulatively once and use its values in a look - up table .",
    "] we note that taking the ensemble average has the advantage of enforcing spherical symmetry of the total effective potential @xmath77 . in calculating ( [ eq :",
    "dipole_selfcon ] ) and ( [ eq : u2 ] ) , we make use of the quantity @xmath78 , which corresponds to the hard - core exclusion diameter for the distribution of atoms in the bulk , i.e. the probability for two atoms to approach within a distance @xmath78 is vanishingly small . for argon @xmath79 and we take advantage of this by explicitly setting @xmath80 for @xmath81 and adjusting the limits of equations ( [ eq : dipole_selfcon ] ) and ( [ eq : u2 ] ) accordingly .",
    "in addition we go beyond lekner s calculation by including the effects of the exchange terms in the bulk .",
    "we do this by performing the same ensemble average as in ( [ eq : u2 ] ) but over the quantities @xmath82 and @xmath83 instead of @xmath84 , obtaining bulk averages @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "these are then included as effective exchange terms , @xmath87 in the dirac - fock scattering equations ( [ eq : dirac_eqn ] ) .",
    "in contrast to @xmath75 , these exchange terms are dependent on the wave function itself , so the ensemble averages must be recalculated at every iteration in the solution of ( [ eq : dirac_eqn ] ) .",
    "plots of the total effective potential @xmath77 felt by an electron when colliding with one atom in the liquid . also shown are the components , @xmath84 and @xmath75 , which represent the direct potential of the atom and the contribution of the remaining atoms in the bulk respectively .",
    "the dashed vertical lines at @xmath88 and @xmath89 indicate the hard - core exclusion radius and the proposed collisional sphere respectively .",
    "note that effects of exchange are not represented in this figure.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    a plot of the functions @xmath77 , @xmath84 and @xmath75 is shown in figure  [ fig : potentials ] .",
    "it can be seen that there is a turning point that occurs at a distance we denote by @xmath89 . in the dense gas limit that we are investigating , this value is @xmath90 .",
    "the turning point at @xmath89 provides a natural distinction between the volume that is under the influence of the focus atom , i.e. the sphere of radius @xmath89 , and that of the rest of the bulk .",
    "hence , we can say that a single collision event takes place when an electron enters and leaves the radius @xmath89 of a single atom .",
    "we note that @xmath91 , i.e. @xmath89 is larger than half of the minimal interatomic separation , which could be considered to define the volume `` owned by '' the focus atom and hence a logical choice for the `` collision event radius '' .",
    "@xmath89 is also different from the wigner - seitz diameter @xmath92 @xcite , although it is very similar .",
    "we would now like to solve for the scattering properties , in particular the cross - sections , from such a collision process .",
    "we assume that it remains reasonable to extract the cross - sections through the phase shifts in a partial wave expansion . in order to determine these , lekner chose to shift the effective potential by an amount @xmath93 such that @xmath94 , and to set the potential @xmath95 , and finally matched to the asymptotic form of each partial wave in the usual fashion .",
    "in contrast , we choose to leave the potential unaltered , but calculate the phase shift at the point @xmath89 instead , effectively setting the upper limits of equations ( [ eq : ak_integral ] ) and ( [ eq : bk_integral ] ) to be @xmath89 instead of infinity .",
    "we note that this is also known as calculating the `` phase function '' @xcite at the point @xmath89 , which is equivalent to setting @xmath95 and matching to the asymptotic form of the wave function .",
    "we believe that this more accurately represents the available energy states in the bulk .",
    "we denote this cross - section , including external contributions and screening effects , by @xmath96 .",
    "as we may assume @xmath80 for @xmath81 and because we calculate the potential only up to a distance of @xmath97 , we can see that the integral over @xmath59 in ( [ eq : u2 ] ) is non - zero only for @xmath98 . at these ranges , the dominant contribution to",
    "the potential comes from the polarization component .",
    "we also note that the values of @xmath85 and @xmath86 are not well behaved for larger distances and so we set them to be zero for @xmath99 .",
    "we have performed calculations that neglect the contribution of @xmath85 and @xmath86 to the bulk and compared these to the full calculations , which showed very little difference in the high energy regime of the resultant cross - sections and a small difference of up to 5% otherwise .",
    "the effect of this change on the transport properties was a small but non - negligible deviation .",
    "the choice of the value for @xmath89 is a crucial part of our calculation .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the choice we make above is consistent in the limit of @xmath100 ; in this case @xmath75 is so weak that it is only after @xmath84 has significantly decayed for very large values of @xmath49 that @xmath101 .",
    "hence , @xmath102 as @xmath100 and our calculation reduces to the usual scattering calculation from a single atom",
    ". however , in the dense case , it is not known whether @xmath103 is the best choice to model the scattering in the liquid .",
    "hence , we have also performed a sensitivity analysis on the parameter @xmath89 .",
    "we denote the distance at which we calculate the phase shifts by @xmath104 and allow it to vary from our initial choice of @xmath105 .",
    "the resultant cross - sections from a variation of @xmath106 are shown in figure  [ fig : rm_variation ] as well as the more straightforward choice of @xmath107 .",
    "we note that atrazhev et al @xcite have implicitly investigated this variation previously , in order to describe the effect of density fluctuations on the effective cross - sections . in their case ,",
    "the value of @xmath104 was set to be the wigner - seitz cell radius , which itself depends on the density of the liquid .",

    "importantly , the more obvious choice of yields a dramatically different behaviour . as will be shown later ,",
    "the effect that these variations have on the transport measurements is significant and shifts the peak observed in various transport properties .",
    "we note that we neglect the effect of density fluctuations , which would modify the effective cross - section for the liquid .",
    "this was investigated by atrazhev et al @xcite , and shown to have a significant contribution to the cross - sections .",
    "however , their article focused on a density for which the effective liquid cross - section vanishes , causing the density fluctuations to be the largest contribution for small electron energies . in our case , we can expect density fluctuations to cause both enhancements and reductions of the cross - sections , which would cancel out on average .",
    "the behaviour of electrons in gaseous and liquid argon , driven out of equilibrium via an electric field @xmath109 , can be described by the solution of the boltzmann s equation for the phase - space distribution function @xmath110  @xcite :    @xmath111    where @xmath112 @xmath113 and @xmath114 denote the position , velocity and charge of the electron respectively . the collision operator @xmath115 accounts for interactions between the electrons of mass @xmath116 and the background material .",
