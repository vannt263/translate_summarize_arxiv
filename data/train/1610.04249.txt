    "hence the total metal production and efficiency of the enrichment process are unclear . understanding how stellar population transit from popiii to popii stars , and whether massive popiii star clusters are able to form at @xmath12 is crucial given the capabilities of future mission such as e.g. the _ james - webb - space telescope _",

    ". in the following we will refer to such systems as dual emitters .",
    "@xcite conducted a search for dual emitters , by targeting @xmath0 emitting galaxies ( laes ) with high @xmath0 equivalent width ( ew ) . because the @xmath0 ew is proportional to the ratio of ionizing photons to non - ionizing uv continuum photons ( see however , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it depends on the stellar population and it is @xmath13 for a salpeter - like imf .",
    "hence , laes with unusual high ew are prime candidates to find dual emitters .",
    "however , the survey by @xcite did not detect heii from any laes in their sample , which indicates an upper limit for the cosmic star formation density of popiii stars , @xmath14 at @xmath15 .",
    "recently @xcite have reported the detection of heii from a bright lae at @xmath16 , which is called cr7 .",
    "cr7 is very luminous in @xmath0 with @xmath17 , has a high ew @xmath18 , and no detection of metal lines ( see however , bowler et al .",

    ", it is close to a system of star forming galaxies at a projected distance of @xmath19 .",

    "a massive primordial cloud has to collapse .",
    "@xcite suggest that the collapse of cr7 could be suppressed by photo - ionization from the neighboring galaxies , and that only once the halo grows massive enough the gas can collapse .",
    "@xcite show that indeed cosmological hydrodynamics simulation , produce conditions as required for the formation of popiii clusters",
    ". however , the mass they find is smaller than required by the observations of @xcite .",
    "one main obstacle in forming a massive popiii star clusters is that over the life - time of massive stars , a few myrs , the gas needs to collapse and the formation of the popiii star cluster needs to take place .",
    "if the gas has sufficient specific angular momentum it will settle in a large scale disc and collapse will take place on a viscous time scale ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "an efficient mechanism to fuel a central star burst on shorter time scales and to destroy such disc is via mergers @xcite .",
    "however , time scales for mergers and the dropping merger rate at high redshifts limit the efficiency of this process ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . alternatively , gas can loose its angular momentum via @xmath0-photon - drag already before settling in a disc while orbiting through a high intensity , homogenous background of @xmath0 photons @xcite .    while @xmath21photon drag is able to remove angular momentum , @xcite",
    "show that intense @xmath0 flux can cause galactic outflow as well .",
    "their 1-d @xmath0 radiative - hydrodynamics simulations show that such outflows can produce asymmetric @xmath0 line profiles with red wing which was consistent with the observations .    in this paper",
    ", we will investigate the formation of massive popiii - dominated galaxies by focusing on the effect that @xmath0 photons have on angular momentum transport and outflows we will present the range of halo masses and required @xmath0 luminosities to form massive popiii galaxies .",
    "the enrichment process of the ism by popiii stars is very quick and of the order @xmath22 yr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this in effect allows for only one generation of popiii stars being born in a halo ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to form a massive popiii star cluster",
    "thus requires a massive primordial gas cloud that can fragment and form popiii stars in one go .",

    "if we assume uniform density just after virialization , the optical depth over the halo is estimated by @xmath59 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , where @xmath60 .",
    "then we can derive @xmath61 for the halo with @xmath62 , @xmath63 we estimate the @xmath0 photon number density in a halo as a function of the halo mass and redshift to be : @xmath64 a high background of @xmath0 radiation will exert a drag on hi gas clouds moving within it , because of the anisotropic radiation field due to the doppler shift and beaming effects .",
    "@xcite estimate the drag force for a hydrogen test particle in the residual ionized bubble around a pop - iii star , and provide the following fitting function , @xmath65 using the above equation , we consider the loss of angular momentum of gas to the @xmath0 radiation background . here",

    "if @xmath70 , the galaxy is likely to form a compact gas cloud at the galactic centre instead of a large sale disc .",
    "we estimate the critical halo mass by setting @xmath71 , @xmath72 if a halo is more massive than @xmath73 , collapse to a central gas cloud is very efficient and a massive popiii starburst can take place . as the halo mass and corresponding virial temperature increases",
    ", thermal energy will be released via he line cooling and free - free emission , resulting in @xmath74 .",

    "gas in haloes with masses @xmath75 can loose its angular momentum efficiently .",
    "we consider other lower and upper limits corresponding to @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the temperature of ionized gas depends on the flux and shape of the sed of the source .",
    "if the source is an agn emitting hard x - rays , it can doubly ionize helium and increase the temperature to more than @xmath78 , however it is difficult to achieve gas hotter than @xmath77 with reasonable spectral indices .",
    "hence we set @xmath79 as the upper limit . for a source with saltpeter - like imf and without agn ,",
    "the temperature of the ionized gas is usually less than @xmath80 , corresponding halo mass of @xmath81 .    in the next subsection",
    "we will estimate the resulting star formation for such a collapse . in this work",
    ", we assume that haloes can collapse if the virial temperature becomes higher than that of ionized gas .",
    "this is because the mean gas density in haloes at @xmath38 is @xmath82 , marginally self - shielding ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "hence , once the gas temperature is smaller than @xmath83 , gas collapses and becomes neutral due to the self - shielding , and then quickly cools down via @xmath0 emission , resulting in star formation .",
    "note that , the estimation of the radiation drag and the critical halo mass assumes primordial gas . for galaxies that are dust enriched",
    ", the @xmath0 photon density does not increase due to dust absorption and in these cases you will form discs , even in haloes more massive than @xmath84 .",

    "we can write the empirical star formation law as :    @xmath87    where @xmath88 $ ] .",
    "now we focus on the situation @xmath89 , which leads to a popiii starburst due to efficient angular momentum transport . on the other hand , if angular momentum is not transported efficiently , i.e. ,",
    "@xmath90 , a rotationally supported disk forms with @xmath91 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where @xmath92 is the spin parameter . in the latter case star formation will proceed quietly following a kennicutt - schmidt law , resulting in @xmath93 , and it is unlikely that this will produce an observable popiii - dominated galaxies .",
    "the life time of popiii stars is @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "after the initial starburst , popiii supernovae produce metals and evacuate most gas from a halo .",
    "therefore , the maximum stellar mass is estimated by multiplying the life time to the star formation rate of equation  ( [ eq : sfr ] ) for fixed @xmath45 , @xmath94 most of the @xmath0 emission comes from recombinations in gas previously ionized by uv radiation from popiii stars .",
    "thus the @xmath0 luminosity is proportional to the ionizing photon emissivity of stars @xmath25 , and we estimate it as : @xmath95 where @xmath35 is escape fraction of ionizing photons .",
    "@xmath35 is typically @xmath96 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the effective temperature of popiii stars is @xmath97 , and the mass dependence is very weak @xcite .",
    "hence , the total ionizing photon emissivity is proportional to the total stellar mass independent to the detailed initial mass function ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we estimate the total ionizing photon emissivity by using that of a @xmath98 pop iii star calculated in @xcite , resulting in the relation , @xmath99 .",
    "hence , combining equation  ( [ eq : stmass ] ) and ( [ eq : lum ] ) shows the relation between @xmath0 luminosity and halo mass at a specific redshift , @xmath100 the range of @xmath0 luminosity is shown in the lower panel of figure  [ fig : mcrit ] .",
    "our model indicates that popiii - dominated galaxies have @xmath0 luminosity of @xmath101 .",

    "therefore , we argue that cr7 is not a popiii star cluster .",
    "this is in agreement with recent observational data from spitzer / irac that indicates [ oiii ] emission from cr7 @xcite , indicating an enriched population of stars .",
    "the predicted @xmath0 luminosity range is detectable even with current telescopes , suggesting that laes , which have high ew and are in the luminosity range near star - forming galaxies or agns , can be popiii - dominated galaxies . on the other hand",
    ", the heii @xmath8 line flux can be lower than the @xmath0 line by @xmath102 orders depending on the imf of popiii stars @xcite and hence its flux is difficult to detected with current telescopes .",
    "spectroscopy with jwst will be able to detect the heii lines within a reasonable integration time as a signature of popiii - dominated galaxies .",
    "the threshold stellar mass with integration times of @xmath103 hours is @xmath104 assuming a top - heavy popiii imf with @xmath105 .      as popiii stars enter the zams ( zero age main sequence ) , they start to exert feedback on the interstellar medium ( ism ) and may cause galactic outflows . due to the trapping of @xmath0 radiation in a halo",
    ", @xmath0 radiation pressure can be higher than the thermal pressure of ionized gas or radiation pressure by hi photo - absorption or thompson scattering @xcite .",
    "the momentum equation is then approximately given by , @xmath107 if we substitute the expression for the @xmath0 luminosity from equation  ( [ eq : lum ] ) into the first term on the right hand side , we find that the radiation pressure is higher than the gravitational force for haloes with @xmath108 , i.e. , the radiation pressure can drive an outflow . for the halo mass range with popiii starbursts ( @xmath109 ) ,",
    "the gravitational force is negligible .",
    "we estimate the outflow velocity considering only the @xmath0 radiation pressure by integrating the above equation over 4 myr as @xmath110 the outflow velocity does not depend on halo mass . the velocity is smaller than the escape velocity for haloes in the mass range , @xmath111 .",
    "therefore , @xmath0 radiation pressure alone is not enough to evacuating gas from haloes .",
    "popiii supernovae then take over driving the wind .",
