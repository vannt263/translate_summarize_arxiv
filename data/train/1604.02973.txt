    "as we know bekenstain , hawking and bardeen by comparing the laws of black hole mechanics and ordinary thermodynamics and by using the appropriate quantities as a temperature , entropy and energy and etc , clarified that all laws of black hole mechanics are identical to the laws of ordinary thermodynamics and hence the black hole will be like thermal system [ 1 - 3 ] .",
    "+ in recent years , the thermodynamic properties and critical behaviour of various black hole are investigated by ref.s . [ 4 - 15 ] . but this topic is attractive when we study black hole thermodynamic in the presence of a negative cosmological constant .",
    "the most important example will be ads black holes with various phase transitions and dual thermal field theory .",
    "also the physics of such black holes has been improved by the ads / cft correspondence[16,17 ] .",
    "the primary study of ads black hole phase transition started with the famous hawking - page phase transition .",
    "they demonstrated a phase transition between the schwarzschild ads black hole and thermal ads space [ 18 ] .",
    "one of the interesting results is investigation of phase transition of reissner - nordstrom - ads ( rn - ads ) black hole .",
    "the study of charged ads black holes indicated that they behave much like the liquid - gas system , this analogy was completed by considering in the extended phase space . in this case , the cosmological constant treat as thermodynamic pressure and its conjugate quantity as thermodynamic volume [ 19 - 27 ] .",
    "+ on the other hand the influence of different topologies on the @xmath0 criticality of black hole can not be ignored in the extended phase space . in this regard",
    "some efforts have been made such as study of thermodynamic of topological black hole solutions in einstein gravity [ 28,29 ] , einstein - gauss- bonnet gravity , dilaton gravity [ 30]and lovelock gravity [ 31 ] .",
    "+ the investigation of charged ads black holes in einstein gravity indicated , the critical behavior exists only for a black hole with horizon of spherical topology but for planner and hyperbolic cases there is not any critical behavior [ 32 ] .",
    "similar investigation has been made for charged black hole in gauss- bonnet gravity .",
    "the obtained results was similar to results of study of charged ads black holes in einstein gravity[33 ] .",
    "+ the results of research of black hole solutions in the horava - lifshitz gravity was remarkable and was exactly opposite to einstein theory [ 34 - 39 ] . because the phase transition of charged topological black holes in horava - lifshitz gravity only take place in @xmath1 ( hyperbolic horizon ) .",
    "the result is true in the absence of black hole charge too .",
    "this consequence does not satisfy in the extended phase space . in this case for all horizon topologies there is not any physical critical point for the uncharged and the charged cases .",
    "therefore topological black hole in horava - lifshitz gravity like the btz black holes , have not any phase transition in the extended phase space .",
    "+ with studying two black holes ( btz and horava - lifshitz ) , one can said that the existence of cosmological constant in the black hole metric is not sufficient for the existence of van der waals like @xmath0 criticality and black hole metric must be modified in such cases .",
    "the problem of phase transition in hl black hole give us motivation to modify the hl black hole .",
    "in that case it , s thermodynamic matches exactly with van der waals fluid .",
    "+ in this paper we show that the corresponding stress energy tensor does not obey any of the energy conditions everywhere outside of the horizon .",
    "also we consider the stability condition and demonstrated that stability exists only in special region .",
    "finally by considering the holography we study heat engine for this solution .",
    "we notice that here for small values of temperature @xmath2 and certain value of temperature @xmath3 we will have the carnot efficiency .",
    "+ now , let us recall some thermodynamic relations which are necessary for the investigation of thermodynamic and phase transition of black hole .",
    "+ the quantities which constitute base of black hole thermodynamics are as follows , @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the surface gravity , the planck length , area of event horizon and energy ( mass ) of black hole respectively .",
    "one can extend this classical subject with definition of pressure and volume .",
    "the cosmological constant is associated with thermodynamic pressure will be as , @xmath9 and thermodynamic conjugate of pressure is interpreted as a black hole thermodynamic volume , @xmath10 the cosmological constant can be changed in the first law of black hole thermodynamic , so in this case the first law in the extended phase space will be as , @xmath11 in extended phase space , the mass is not related to the internal energy @xmath12 of the system , but it is enthalpy which is given by , @xmath13 but when @xmath14 is constant ( the cosmological constant is not allowed to vary ) , the relation ( 4 ) reduces to the standard first law of thermodynamics in the `` non - extended '' phase space .    by using relation ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , we can write a black hole equation of state ( p = p(v , t ) ) and compare it to the corresponding fluid equation of state . in that case , we identify the black hole and fluid temperatures @xmath15 , the black hole and fluid volumes @xmath16 and the cosmological and fluid pressures @xmath17 .",
    "+ on the other hand the van der waals equation is modification of the ideal gas law which includes the nonzero size of molecules and also attraction between corresponding molecules . it is used to describe basic qualitative features of the liquid - gas phase transition , @xmath18 here @xmath19 is the specific volume of the fluid , @xmath14 its pressure , @xmath20 its temperature and @xmath21 is the boltzmann constant . the constant @xmath22 indicate the nonzero size of the molecules of fluid and the constant @xmath23 show the attraction between molecules . as we know , the charged or rotating ads black holes confirm the behavior of this equation which indicate the existence of a small / large black hole first - order phase transition corresponding to a liquid / gas phase transition . + but the analogy between the thermodynamics of charged / rotating ads black holes and thermodynamics of the van der waals fluid is only qualitative , namely the corresponding equations of state are not the same . in that case",
    "one can not identify the black hole parameters such as charge @xmath24 or rotation @xmath25 with the fluid parameters @xmath26 and @xmath27 then it is necessary to construct an asymptotically ads black hole whose thermodynamics properties matches exactly with the corresponding van der waals fluid [ 23 ] .",
    "so , generally we can say that in order to match two side of pointed theory , we need to construct an asymptotically ads black hole .",
    "now we are going to look at the solution of horava - lifshitz black hole .",
    "so first we try to introduce the hl black hole and apply the above information on the corresponding black hole .",
    "one of the interesting kinds of black holes is the horava - lifshitz black hole , which may be regarded as a @xmath28 candidate for general relativity .",
    "the hl gravity is a non - relativistic renormalizable theory of gravity at a lifshitz point which provides an interesting framework to study the connection between ordinary gravity and string theory .",
    "it is expected that the hl black hole solutions asymptotically become einstein gravity solutions .",
    "also it is found that a schwarzschild ads solution can be realized in infrared modified hl gravity theory .",
    "+ the four - dimensional gravity action of hl theory is given by the following expression , @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are constant parameters and @xmath32 is cotton tensor , @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the extrinsic curvature , @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the shift and the lapse functions respectively , also the cosmological constant is given by the following relation , @xmath38 the hl black hole metric is given by [ 40 ] ,    @xmath39    and @xmath40 is given by the following relation [ 41 ] , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is integration constant .",
    "there are two limits of @xmath43 black hole which will be following .",
    "the first one is kehagius - sfetsos ( ks ) solution of hl black hole which is obtained by @xmath44 and @xmath45 [ 42 ] . in that case",
    "( 12 ) reduces to the following expression , @xmath46    the second one is lu - mei - pop ( lmp ) solution of hl black hole which is obtained by @xmath47 and @xmath48 , where @xmath49 related to the black hole mass @xmath50 . in that case",
    "( 12 ) reduces to the following expression , @xmath51 and the charged topological black holes in horava - lifshitz gravity were investigated by ref.s [ 3,18 ] . when the dynamical coupling constant @xmath52 is set to one , the corresponding metric is given by , @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 corresponds to the negative cosmological constant . the physical mass and the charge ( @xmath24 ) corresponding to the black hole solution are respectively given by , @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the integration constants , @xmath59 is the volume of the two dimensional einstein space and @xmath5 and @xmath31 are the constant parameters of the theory .",
    "the event horizon is the solution of the equation @xmath60 .",
    "in this section , we are going to modify the equation ( 15 ) for the case @xmath61 , where thermodynamics properties of black hole coincide exactly with the given fluid equation of state . in order to modify such metric background ,",
    "first we give ansatz for the following @xmath62 , @xmath63 in order to simplify the corresponding results , we set @xmath64 .",
    "now we are going to determine the function @xmath65 which has to be satisfy with einstein field equations .",
    "so , generally we assume that above metric is a solution of the einstein field equations with a given energy momentum source , @xmath66 . in order that the energy - momentum source be physically acceptable",
    "it should be satisfied by certain following conditions : + 1)the energy density be positive .",
    "+ 2)the energy density conquest to pressure .",
    "+ these conditions are known as energy conditions , e.g. [ 43 ] .",
    "the minimal requirement which can be exerted is the weak energy condition .",
    "so , the energy conditions will be following : @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are energy density and principal pressure respectively .",
    "also , @xmath68 and @xmath69 clarified by the following relations , @xmath70 after determining @xmath62 , we examine the corresponding energy conditions .",
    "the mass of the black hole @xmath71 is related to the horizon radius @xmath72 according to the following expression , @xmath73    on the other hand the black hole temperature is given by the following equation ,    @xmath74    as we expressed , we want to construct a metric which thermodynamics properties of black hole matches exactly to the thermodynamic of the van der waals fluid . for this purpose",
    ", we compare the temperature of @xmath20 in equation ( 21 ) with ( 6 ) and substitute @xmath75 , @xmath76    we give for the first time the following ansatz , @xmath77 by substituting the equation ( 23 ) in equation ( 22 ) , @xmath78 and @xmath79 will be as , @xmath80 and @xmath81 by replacing @xmath79 and @xmath78 in the relation ( 17 ) we have following @xmath62 , @xmath82 since @xmath26 is positive , we conclude that topology of the horizon is hyperbolic . without loss of generality we can set @xmath83 .",
    "+ now by arranging @xmath62 , we can investigate the energy condition . by using relation ( 19 )",
    "we obtain @xmath68 and @xmath69 , @xmath84 we display the energy density @xmath68 ( solid and dash curves ) and the quantity @xmath85 ( dot curve ) with respect to @xmath72 .",
    "we always have @xmath86 , and for arbitrary pressure and everywhere outside of the horizon , we have @xmath87 .",
    "but if the pressure be sufficiently small ( @xmath88 ) , so the energy condition @xmath89 satisfy inside a region enough close to the horizon which is illustrated by fig ( 1 ) .",
    "now we want to consider stability condition for the corresponding system . in that case",
    ", we need two quantities which play important role for the study of stability system as gibbs free energy and heat capacity .",
    "when the gibbs free energy is negative @xmath90 , the system has a global stability . for the local stability equilibrium for a thermodynamic system",
    "requires that @xmath91 [ 44,45 ] . in that case , the heat capacity at constant pressure and constant volume is given by , @xmath92 the hawking temperature can be derived as , @xmath93 the entropy of black hole can be determined by , @xmath94 in the above equation , @xmath95 is the integration constant . utilizing eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , the thermodynamic volume can be calculated by , @xmath96 as we see in equation ( 31 ) the volume depend on @xmath72 and @xmath14 .",
    "then one can say , the heat capacity at constant volume vanishes , @xmath97 one can obtain , @xmath98 we draw @xmath99 in terms of @xmath72 which are depicted in figures ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) . by comparing figures",
    "we notice that @xmath100 parameter play important role in the local stability but @xmath101 is not .    in order to discuss the global stability of the black hole",
    "we need to calculate the gibbs free energy which is given by , @xmath102 and @xmath103 where @xmath104    as we see in figures ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) , here @xmath101 parameter plays an important role in global stability for certain pressure and @xmath105 parameter .",
    "in this section , we intend to consider holographic heat engine for our black hole solution .",
    "we start with equation of state of black hole @xmath106 which is relation between temperature , horizon radius , other parameter of black hole as a cosmological constant . by using the @xmath106 function",
    "one can define an engine as a closed path in @xmath0 plane .",
    "this lead us to have input and output heat as @xmath107 and @xmath108 respectively .",
    "the total mechanical work is @xmath109 and also the efficiency of the heat engine is determined by relation @xmath110 .",
    "+ the properties of the heat engine depends on the equation of state and the choice of path in @xmath0 plane . for a heat engine which works between two temperatures @xmath111 and @xmath112 the maximum efficiency",
    "will be carnot efficiency [ 45 - 47 ] .",
    "+ the carnot cycle is made from two isothermal and two adiabatic processes . during isothermal expansion ( constant temperature @xmath111 ) the system absorbs heat of @xmath107 and during isothermal compression ( constant temperature @xmath112 ) loses heat of @xmath108 .",
    "+ the corresponding work done in this cycle is , @xmath113 and total amount of absorbed thermal energy will be as , @xmath114 the efficiency @xmath115 is defined by , @xmath116 this relation show as the any high efficiency not to be allowed because it violate the second law .",
    "of course there is other method to connect two isotherms @xmath111 and @xmath112 which are isochoric paths .",
    "the formed cycle is called the stirling cycle , which has an efficiency less than the carnot efficiency . + for static black holes the carnot cycle and the stirling cycle are identical . because in such a black holes the entropy and the volume both depend on the same single variable , the horizon radius [ 46,47 ] .",
    "so isochores and adiabatic are the same .",
    "+ now we study the efficiency of heat engine for our black hole and investigate under what conditions , our cycle has the carnot efficiency . as we noticed in pervious section , the heat capacity at constant volume vanishes for our solution",
    "this is useful because it can define another cycle in @xmath0 plane , as a rectangle which is composed of isobars and isochores , see fig ( 7 )    the work done along the isobars is , @xmath117    the heat flows occur along to the top and the bottom of the figure . here",
    ", one can determine the inflow of heat with the upper isobar , which is @xmath107 and given by , @xmath118 in order to calculate the integral we need to write the heat capacity in terms of @xmath20 also @xmath99 and @xmath20 are both in terms of @xmath72 .",
    "so , this is complicated integral and one can not solve directly . in that case for the simplicity of the calculation we take a high temperature limit . in high temperature limit",
    "we have , @xmath119 and @xmath120 then @xmath121 also in this limit the thermodynamical volume is ,    @xmath122    by substitution in relation ( 40 ) we have ,    @xmath123    therefore , the efficiency of this heat engine is ,    @xmath124    where @xmath49 , @xmath125 eq . ( 47 ) is satisfied with the condition @xmath126 , and if @xmath127 we will have the carnot efficiency .",
    "figures ( 8 - 12 ) shows the behavior of @xmath49 with respect to temperature @xmath3 for different values of @xmath100 and @xmath101 parameter where we can see the comparison between them . from figures ( 8 - 12 )",
    ", we see that the system has efficiency in a certain range of @xmath2 temperature and the efficiency increases by reducing @xmath2 in this certain range .",
    "also the system will have the carnot efficiency for two specific values of @xmath3 temperature .",
    "with comparison of figures ( 8) , ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) we note that increasing @xmath100 and @xmath101 parameters the @xmath3 also increases .",
    "figure ( 11 ) shows that @xmath101 parameter affects on efficiency of system more than @xmath100 parameter .",
    "according to figure ( 12 ) , when @xmath100 and @xmath101 are both positive , we will have efficiency for large value of @xmath105 parameter .",
    "but for @xmath128 and arbitrary of @xmath105 the system has a efficiency .",
    "as we know the investigation of phase structure of horava - lifshitz black hole has been shown that the phase transition exists only for hyperbolic topology of the horizon in the non - extended phase space .",
    "this result shown that horava - lifshitz theory is not exactly identical to einstein theory . because in einstein theory no exists phase transition for k=0 , -1 but exist in case of k=1 . in considering phase structure of this black hole in the extended phase space",
    "it has been discovered that this black hole has any phase transition .",
    "+ in this paper , we modified the solution of the horava - lifshitz black hole for @xmath61 .",
    "+ we have shown that the modified solution dose not satisfy any of three standard energy condition everywhere outside of horizon .",
    "but for small pressure in near horizon the modified solution satisfied by weak energy condition . also , we studied the heat engine and some carnot efficiency . from several figures",
    "we have shown that for small temperature , we have suitable carnot efficiency . finally , we investigated the stability of system and obtained some parameters which play important role in such background .",
