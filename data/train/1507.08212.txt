    "though the degree sequence of a graph is one of the simplest possible invariants of a graph , it has attracted considerable interest and yielded beautiful results .",
    "several different tests are known for determining if a list of integers is a degree sequence , and many authors have written about the properties that the graphs having a given degree sequence ( the _ realizations _ of the sequence ) can or must have .",
    "in particular , several authors have asked or answered questions concerning the uniqueness of realizations . in the case of strict uniqueness , where there is only one possible realization of a degree sequence once degrees are prescribed for labeled vertices ,",
    "the degree sequences involved are the threshold sequences ; their realizations are called threshold graphs ( see the monograph  @xcite for a survey ) .",
    "a more relaxed question of uniqueness requires that there only be one realization of the degree sequence up to isomorphism ( the degree sequence @xmath0 , for instance , has three distinct realizations but only one up to isomorphism ) .",
    "degree sequences with realizations from a unique isomorphism class are called unigraphic , and their realizations are unigraphs . for a discussion of unigraphs and a good bibliography ,",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "( when questions of uniqueness are addressed in later sections of this paper , our understanding of uniqueness will be in the former sense , where isomorphism classes are ignored and graphs with distinct edge sets are considered to be distinct . )",
    "the degree sequence is not the only descriptive parameter based on the degrees of vertices . in  @xcite , patrinos and hakimi",
    "considered _ integer - pair sequences _ , collections of unordered pairs of integers produced by recording the degrees of the two endpoints of each edge in a graph ( or pseudograph , multigraph , etc . ) .",
    "they determined which sequences of integer pairs can be realized by a graph , pseudograph , or multigraph , and later das  @xcite characterized the integer - pair sequences that correspond to a single graph ( up to isomorphism ) .",
    "more recently , authors have studied a reformulation of integer - pair sequences known as the _ joint degree matrix _ , where multiplicities of integer pairs are recorded in matrix form  @xcite .    the integer - pair sequence and joint degree matrix yield more information about a graph than a degree sequence does , and in this paper we introduce a new degree - related parameter , the _ neighborhood degree list _",
    "( ndl ) , that yields still more .",
    "the neighborhood degree list of a graph @xmath1 is a list @xmath2 whose elements are lists of the degrees in @xmath1 of the neighbors of a given vertex .",
    "for example , if @xmath1 is the graph obtained by attaching a pendant vertex to a chordless 4-cycle , then @xmath3 .",
    "notice how the degree sequence @xmath4 of @xmath1 is apparent from the lengths of the elements of @xmath5 ( we call these elements the _ component lists _ ) .",
    "the order of the main list , together with the order of integers within component lists , is usually of little consequence , though for convenience we will order the integers within a component list from largest to smallest and will list the component lists in descending order of length .",
    "we can represent an ndl graphically by placing the integers it contains into the young diagram of its degree sequence in much the same way young tableaux are represented , with the terms of one component list per row .",
    "for example , we depict the ndl @xmath6 from above by the diagram in figure  [ fig : firsttableau ] .",
    "note that our orderings of numbers within rows and columns of the diagram does not follow typical monotonicity rules for young tableaux .    2 & 2 & 1 + 3 & 2 + 3 & 2 + 2 & 2 + 3    besides providing more information than the degree sequence and the integer - pair sequence or joint degree matrix ,",
    "our motivation for studying neighborhood degree lists comes from a few contexts . in situations where it becomes necessary to distinguish between nonisomorphic graphs having the same degree sequence , it may be possible to do so by consulting their ndls .",
    "the first author used ndls in this way in a proof in  @xcite ( see theorem 2.3 therein ) .",
    "we find another application in graph reconstruction , which we now describe .",
    "the well known graph reconstruction conjecture , attributed to kelly  @xcite and ulam  @xcite , states that every @xmath7-vertex graph ( where @xmath8 ) is uniquely determined up to isomorphism by the multiset of its induced subgraphs of order @xmath9 .",
    "these subgraphs are called the _ cards _ of the graph , and the collection of cards is called the _ deck_. given the deck of an unknown graph @xmath1 , a standard counting argument yields the degree sequence of @xmath1 : first , sum the numbers of edges in each of the cards ; denote the result by @xmath10 .",
    "the graph @xmath1 then contains exactly @xmath11 edges , since each edge appears in all but two of the cards .",
    "given any card of @xmath1 , we can then subtract the number of edges in the card from the number @xmath11 to determine the degree of the missing vertex .",
    "doing this for each card in turn yields the degree sequence of @xmath1 .",
    "however , the degree sequence is not all we can determine in this way . by comparing the degree sequence of the card and the degree of the missing vertex to the degree sequence of the graph @xmath1 , it is possible to determine the degrees in @xmath1 of the vertices to which the missing vertex is adjacent .",
    "thus our counting argument yields not only the degree sequence but also the neighborhood degree list of @xmath1 .",
    "( it also shows that the reconstruction conjecture is true for graphs that are uniquely determined , up to isomorphism , by their ndls . )    in this paper we initiate a study of the ndl of a graph . in section  [ sec : graphic ndls ] we characterize the ndls of simple graphs and describe how to construct the realizations of one . in section  [ sec : n - switches ] we present an edge - switching operation for transforming one realization of an ndl into any other realization of the same ndl .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : ndl - unique ] , we determine the ndl analogues of threshold sequences and graphs by determining which ndls have unique realizations by labeled graphs , and which graphs these are .    throughout the paper",
    ", we use @xmath12 to denote the vertex set of a graph @xmath1 .",
    "we denote the degree sequence of @xmath1 by @xmath13 , and the degree in @xmath1 of a vertex @xmath14 by @xmath15 or by @xmath16 , if @xmath1 is understood from the context .",
    "in this section we characterize those lists of lists of integers that are neighborhood degree lists of simple graphs .",
    "we say that a _ tableau _ is a list @xmath17 of @xmath7 lists of nonnegative integers , where the lengths @xmath18 of the component lists are in descending order , as are the terms @xmath19 in each component list .",
    "a tableau is _ feasible _ if each integer appearing in the tableau is equal to one of the terms @xmath20 .",
    "we now define some notation that will be used throughout the paper .",
    "let the tableau @xmath21 in be a feasible tableau , and let @xmath22 .",
    "for any integer @xmath23 appearing in @xmath24 , let @xmath25 denote the subset of @xmath26 containing elements @xmath27 for which @xmath28 .",
    "for each @xmath29 and integer @xmath30 appearing in @xmath24 , let @xmath31 denote the number of times the term @xmath30 appears in the tableau component list @xmath32 .    for each integer @xmath23 appearing in @xmath24 , let @xmath33 be the list consisting of the terms @xmath34 for all @xmath29 ; while order of terms in @xmath33 will largely be unimportant , we may stipulate that the terms @xmath34 be arranged in increasing order of @xmath27 . for distinct integers @xmath23 and @xmath30 both appearing in @xmath24 , with @xmath35 , let @xmath36 be the bipartitioned list in which the first part contains the terms @xmath37 for all @xmath29 , and",
    "the second part contains the terms @xmath34 for all @xmath38 ; terms in both parts may be assumed to be arranged in increasing order of @xmath27 .    as an example , in the tableau @xmath6 illustrated in the previous section , we may write @xmath39 and @xmath40 and @xmath41 ; also @xmath42 and @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : subtableau ] , in a graphical representation of the tableau , computing @xmath33 corresponds to counting those boxes containing a @xmath23 in rows of length @xmath23 while @xmath36 consists of first counting boxes containing an @xmath30 in rows of length @xmath23 followed by counting boxes containing a @xmath23 in rows of length @xmath30 .    2 & 2 & 1 + 3 & * ( lightgray ) 2 & & & + 3 & * ( lightgray ) 2 & & & & & & & + * ( lightgray ) 2 & * ( lightgray ) 2 & & & + 3    * ( gray ) 2 & * ( gray ) 2 & 1 & & + * ( lightgray)3 & 2 & & & + * ( lightgray)3 & 2 & & & & & & & + 2 & 2 & & &",

    "finally , note that none of the n - switches described above , in any of the subgraphs induced on @xmath25 or in the bipartite subgraph joining @xmath25 and @xmath54 , has any effect on any of the other subgraphs involving different values of @xmath23 and @xmath30 .",

    "the list @xmath36 is the degree sequence of a unique bipartitioned graph .",
    "3 .   @xmath21 has a realization that does not admit any n - switch .",
    "since an n - switch changes the adjacencies of a graph but does not change the neighborhood degree list of that graph , it is clear that condition 1 implies condition 3 ; the converse follows from theorem  [ thm : nswitch sequence ] .",

    "difference graphs have been shown to be bipartite graphs @xcite and appear in many ways to be the bipartite analogue of threshold graphs . in the next theorem , we list a few of their characterizations ; the last condition , which resembles the last condition of theorem  [ thm : threshold char ] , requires a definition , which we give now .",
