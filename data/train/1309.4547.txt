    "one of the most striking peculiarities of the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics is its heavy reliance on the use of complex hilbert spaces . in its core formulation ,",
    "the state of a quantum system is represented by a normalized vector of a hilbert space and the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics is formalized by interpreting , using the born rule , the quantity @xmath0 as the probability of obtaining eigenvalue @xmath1 ( with @xmath2 denoting the orthogonal projection on the associated eigenspace ) when measuring a quantum system in state @xmath3 , thus emphasizing the importance of the inner product .",
    "however , fundamental as it is , it seems that there still exists no consensus regarding any satisfactory justification of the use of hilbert spaces , so that one might wonder how far we stand from mackey which had to state , in a rather _ ad hoc _ manner , its seventh axiom @xcite  as _ `` the partially ordered set ( or poset ) of all questions in quantum mechanics is isomorphic to the poset of all closed subspaces of a [ ... ] hilbert space . ''",
    "_ this requirement can usually be split into two parts , and many efforts have tried to address both of them : first that the poset of all questions forms an orthomodular lattice , and that this orthomodular lattice is indeed isomorphic to the lattice of all closed subspaces of a hilbert space .",
    "regarding orthomodularity , described by beltrametti and cassinelli @xcite as _ `` the survival [ ... ] of a notion of the logical conditional , which takes the place of the classical implication associated with boolean algebra '' _ , some attempts to justify this as a property verified by the poset of all questions include works by grinbaum @xcite based on the notion of _ `` relevant information '' _ and by the author of the present article @xcite where it is assumed that the considered lattice ensures the definition of sufficiently many _",
    "`` points of view . '' _    as for the second requirement , a central result , piron s celebrated representation theorem , provides conditions for an orthomodular lattice to be isomorphic to the lattice of all closed subspaces of a hilbert space ( or , more precisely , to a _",
    "generalized _ hilbert space , that is where it is not required that the used field is a `` classical '' one ) @xcite .",
    "however , one of those conditions , namely the _ covering law _ , _ `` presents a [ ... ] delicate problem . [ ... ] it is probably safe to say that no simple and entirely compelling argument has been given for assuming its general validity '' _  @xcite .       in the present article",
    ", we present some simple geometric conditions which are sufficient to ensure that the hypotheses of piron s representation theorem are verified .",
    "our approach is based on the notion of dimension and , more precisely , on the fact that this very notion can indeed be defined .",
    "actually , it is taken for granted to the point that this requirement , if not implicite , often appears at the very beginning of axiomatic formulations of physics and , more specifically , of quantum mechanics .",
    "for instance , in @xcite , hardy assumes that one can define a _ number of degrees of freedom _",
    "@xmath4 before presenting the _ five reasonable axioms _ of the article . in rovelli",
    "s relational quantum mechanics @xcite , postulate 1 states that _ `` there is a maximum amount of relevant information that can be extracted from a system , '' _ which can be interpreted as the existence of the dimension of a system .",
    "usually , mathematical formulations of physics involve the use of euclidian or hilbert spaces , where the dimension is defined as the common cardinality of every bases of the considered space .",
    "this definition can even be refined by restricting it to orthogonal bases .",
    "in other words , the dimension of a euclidian or hilbert space is the common cardinality of every maximal set of mutually orthogonal vector rays ( which we will call a maximal _ orthoindependant _ set of vector rays ) .",
    "the use of orthogonal bases is a key element on our approach .",
    "intuitively , they constitute a natural set of preferred bases .",
    "mathematically , while the linear independance of the elements of a basis requires to consider the basis as a whole , it can be done in a finitary way for orthogonal bases , since a set is orthoindependant if , and only if , its finite subsets are .    however , while this remark highlights the important role played , in such a context , by orthogonality , it is also clear that this notion can be defined without relying upon the sophisticated machinery of linear and bilinear algebra .",
    "indeed , one can easily imagine a greek philosopher who would , during the antiquity , justify that the space surrounding him is 3-dimensional by exhibiting three orthogonal rods and by arguing that he can not add another rod orthogonal to the first three .    to that respect , we believe that orthogonality should be considered as a primitive geometric notion and we will , in this article , study the way it can lead to a reasonable definition of dimension ( which , indeed , is also basically a geometric notion )",
    ".       our primary tool will be the theory of matroids @xcite which is a very natural algebraic framework for dealing with dimension .",
    "this theory is based on a general notion of independence ( such as the linear independence of the elements of a basis in linear algebra ) which we shall define here using orthogonality . moreover , following our previous discussion about the role of orthogonal bases , we will add the requirement that orthogonal bases do exist and , more precisely , that any set of mutually orthogonal elements ( i.e. any orthoindependant subset ) can be completed into an orthogonal basis .",
    "this will constitute the next section .",
    "we will then show that the obtained algebraic structure , which we call _ orthomatroids _ , is closely related to piron s propositional systems , and finally we will present an adaptation of piron s representation theorem to orthomatroids .",
    "let us first define the notion of orthogonality on a  set",
    ".    given a set @xmath5 , a binary relation @xmath6 on @xmath5 is an _ orthogonality relation _ if , and only if it verifies @xmath7 in the following , such a pair @xmath8 will be called an _",
    "orthoset_.    the basic intuition behind an orthoset @xmath8 is to think of its elements as spatial directions .",
    "obviously , the study of such structures is neither new nor original .",
    "one might refer for instance to the survey in @xcite .",
    "however , we present some basic results in order to introduce the important ideas before considering orthosets in the light of matroids .    given an orthoset @xmath8 and a subset @xmath9 , we define its _ orthogonal complement _",
    "@xmath10  as @xmath11 and its ( bi - orthogonal ) closure @xmath12 .    given an orthoset @xmath8 , we  have @xmath13    for @xmath9 and @xmath14 ,",
    "having @xmath15 would imply that @xmath16 and , in particular , @xmath17 which is not possible . as a consequence , @xmath18 .",
    "now , ( gc ) trivially follows from the symmetry of our orthogonality relation , since @xmath19    this property shows that there is an antitone galois connection @xcite between @xmath5 and itself , realized both ways by @xmath20 .",
    "a direct consequence of this is the following result .",
    "the bi - orthogonal closure operation is indeed a closure operator on @xmath5 , that is it verifies @xmath21    as stated above , this is a direct consequence of having a galois connection .",
    "however , the direct proof of those facts is rather easy .",
    "extensivity trivially follows from ( gc ) , since @xmath22 now , if @xmath23 , then @xmath24 and hence @xmath25 . by applying this deduction once again",
    ", we obtain @xmath26 finally , for idempotence , we only need to prove that @xmath27 which is equivalent , because of ( gc ) , to @xmath28 .",
    "following our initial discussion , we now want to turn an orthoset @xmath8 into a matroid in order to have a suitable definition of dimension .",
    "since we have defined a closure operation on @xmath5 using our orthogonality relation , it is natural to use the closure operator - based definition of a matroid . in that case , we only need to demand that the maclane  steinitz exchange property is verified by @xmath29 : @xmath30 here , @xmath31 denotes the set @xmath32 . with this definition ,",
    "a subset @xmath33 of @xmath5 is independent if , and only  if ( where @xmath34 denotes @xmath35 ) @xmath36       the next step is to add the possibility of defining orthobases in a convenient way . to that respect",
    ", we first have to focus on subsets made of mutually orthogonal elements .",
    "a subset @xmath33 of @xmath5 is said to be _ orthoindependent _ if , and only  if @xmath37    obviously , every orthoindependent subset is independent .",
    "moreover , orthoindependent subsets verify the nice following property :    [ prop : zorn ] if @xmath38 is a chain of orthoindependent subsets , then @xmath39 is also orthoindependent .    by application of zorn s lemma",
    ", the previous proposition implies that there exists maximal orthoindependent subsets and even that every orthoindependent subset is included in a maximal one .       as explained in the introduction",
    ", we will demand that every closed subset @xmath40 of @xmath5 admits an orthobasis .",

    ", we will restrict ourselves , without loss of generality , to simple orthomatroids .",
    "having studied the close relationship between orthomatroids and propositional system , we will now adapt piron s representation theorem to orthomatroids .",
    "this theorem can be stated  as :    every irreducible propositional system of rank at least 4 is ortho - isomorphic to the lattice of ( biorthogonally ) closed subspaces of a generalized hilbert space .",
    "let us recall that a generalized hilbert space @xmath135 consists in a vector space @xmath136 over a field @xmath137 with an involution anti - automorphism @xmath138 and an orthomodular hermitian form @xmath139 satisfying @xmath140 where @xmath141 . we invite the reader to consult @xcite for more informations .",
    "it is well known that the set of bi - orthogonally closed subsets of a generalized hilbert space forms a propositional system . in terms of orthomatroids",
    ", this corresponds to the fact that the set @xmath142 of vector rays of a generalized hilbert space forms a ( simple ) orthomatroid with orthogonality relation @xmath143    in order to express piron s representation theorem in terms of orthomatroids , we need to define the notion of irreducibility .",
    "following @xcite again , given a propositional system @xmath106 , the binary relation @xmath144 defined on @xmath133  by @xmath145 is an equivalence relation on @xmath133 .",
    "the equivalence classes of @xmath133 are then called irreducible components of @xmath133 , and @xmath106 is said to be irreducible if it has a single irreducible component .    given a simple orthomatroid @xmath8 , the previous equivalence relation can be reexpressed as @xmath146 if @xmath147 denotes the irreducible components of @xmath5 by ( with @xmath148 being the restriction of @xmath6 to @xmath149 ) , then @xmath8 can be seen as the disjoint union of its irreducible components ( up to orthoisomorphism ) : @xmath150    we are now able to express piron s representation theorem in terms of orthomatroids , and we finally obtain the following representation theorem :    every simple and irreducible orthomatroid @xmath8 of rank at least 4 is orthoisomorphic to the orthomatroid @xmath151 associated to a generalized hilbert space @xmath135 .",
    "in this article , we have presented a formalism based on the idea that dimension can , at a very primitive level , be defined as the common cardinality of a maximal collections of mutually orthogonal elements ( which , for instance , can be seen as spatial directions ) . using a generic definition of orthogonality , together with the theory of matroids which provides a algebraic structure permitting to define a convenient notion of dimension , and a last requirement regarding the existence of orthobases , we have obtained what we call _ orthomatroids _ which provide a general framework for dealing with dimension in an orthogonality - based context .",
    "we then have shown that orthomatroids do actually exactly capture the structure of propositional systems ( or , more precisely , of the set of atoms @xmath133 of a propositional system @xmath106 , which is sufficient for reconstructing @xmath106 ) with the consequence that , in high enough dimension , irreducible matroids can be represented by generalized hilbert spaces .",
    "we insist on the fact that in this approach , the use of generalized hilbert lattices ( or , at least , of propositional systems ) is entirely derived from simple and generic geometric assumptions . as a result , this suggests that instead of seeing the use of generalized hilbert spaces ( or , again , of propositional systems ) in quantum physics as puzzling , it should in the contrary be seen as the most general ( if not natural ) way to model situations where dimension can be defined in terms of orthogonality , such as in quantum mechanics .",
