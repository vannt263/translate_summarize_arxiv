    "acceleration of electrons with superpower laser beams ( at present of relativistic intensities )  and their interaction with the matter in ultrashort space - time scales have attracted broad interest over the last two decades , stimulated by the continued progress made in laser technology . in many laboratories",
    "@xcite compact lasers can deliver @xmath3 petawatt short pulses , with focused intensities as high as @xmath4 .",
    "next generation multipetawatt and exawatt optical laser systems @xcite will be capable to deliver ultrahigh intensities exceeding @xmath5 , which are well above the ultrarelativistic regime of electron - laser interaction .",
    "laser intensities at which an electron becomes relativistic is defined by the condition @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the relativistic invariant dimensionless parameter of a wave - particle interaction ( @xmath8 is the elementary charge , @xmath9 is the light speed in vacuum , and @xmath10 is the electron mass ) and represents the work of the wave electric field with strength @xmath11 on a wavelength @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) in the units of electron rest energy .",
    "laser intensities expressed via @xmath14 can be estimated as:@xmath15^{-2}.\\]]thus , available optical lasers provide @xmath14 up to @xmath16 , meanwhile with the next generation of laser systems one can manipulate with beams at @xmath14 @xmath17 . in such ultrastrong laser fields , electrons can reach to ultrarelativistic energies . however to obtain ultrarelativistic net energies for field - free electrons",
    "one should bypass the limitations imposed by the well known lawson - woodward theorem @xcite .",
    "one way to get net energy exchange is to use coherent processes of laser - particle interaction with the additional resonances . among those",
    "the induced cherenkov , compton , and undulator processes are especially of interest @xcite . in these induced processes",
    "one can obtain moderate relativistic electron beams of low energy spreads and emittances due to the threshold character of nonlinear resonance in the strong wave field . besides , the use of a plasma medium plasma is a promising way of achieving laser - driven electron acceleration",
    ". however , laser - plasma accelerator schemes face problems connected with the inherent instabilities in laser - plasma interaction processes .",
    "the spectrum of direct acceleration mechanisms of charged particles by a single laser pulse is very restricted , since one should use the laser beams focused to subwavelength waist radii , or use subcycle laser pulses , or use radially polarized lasers .",
    "all these scenarios with different field configurations have been investigated both theoretically and experimentally a1,a2,a3,a4,a5,a6,a7,a8,a9,a10,a11,a12,a13,a14,a15,a16,a17 .",
    "the lawson - woodward theorem can also be bypassed by terminating the field , either by reflection , absorption , or diffraction @xcite .",
    "the proof of principle experiment of this type has been reported in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "it is used initially relativistic electron beam and a moderately strong laser pulse . to obtain dense enough electron bunches it is reasonable to consider electrons acceleration from nanoscale - solid plasma - targets mirror1,mirror2,mirror3,mirror4 at intensities high enough to separate all electrons from ions @xcite .",
    "thus , combining these two schemes one can obtain ultrarelativistic solid density electron bunches .",
    "such bunches can be used to obtain high - flux of positrons , @xmath1-quanta with possible applications in material science , medicine , and nuclear physics .    in the present work we propose an efficient mechanism for creation of ultrarelativistic field - free electron bunches , gamma - ray and positron beam of high fluxes by a single laser pulse of ultrarelativistic intensities .",
    "the scheme is as follows : a laser beam of ultrarelativistic intensities is focused onto nanoscale - solid plasma - target with relatively low @xmath18 . from this target under the action of ultrashort laser pulse a superdense electron bunch",
    "is formed and accelerated up to ultrarelativistic energies .",
    "then we place a high-@xmath18 target ( tungsten or gold ) at the distances where the electron bunch gains maximum energy from the laser pulse .",
    "the purpose of the second target is twofold .",
    "first , it acts as a reflector for laser pulse , being practically transparent for electron bunch . as a consequence we get field - free ultrarelativistic electron bunch .",
    "second , within this target with sufficiently large thickness the generation of hard @xmath0-quanta and positron fluxes takes place due to the electron - ion collisions .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii for supershort strongly nonplane ultrarelativistic laser pulses of linear and circular polarizations 3d3v problem is solved via numerical simulations . in sec .",
    "iii we present numerical calculations for produced @xmath1-quanta and positron fluxes .",
    "finally , conclusions are given in sec .",
    "here we report on the results of the 3d3v simulations of superintense laser beam interaction with solid - plasma - targets .",
    "the illustration of proposed scheme is as follows : a laser beam of ultrarelativistic intensities ( @xmath19 ) is focused onto solid - plasma - target of nanothickness with relatively low @xmath18 . for concreteness",
    "we take carbon target ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "target is assumed to be fully ionized .",
    "this is justified since the intensity for full ionization of carbon is about @xmath21 @xmath22 , while we use in simulations intensities at least on two order of magnitude larger .",
    "so , the target will become fully ionized before the arrival of the pulse peak .",
    "electrons are assumed to be cold in the target , @xmath23 .",
    "the carbon target size is @xmath24 in the @xmath25 plane and @xmath26 in @xmath27 direction ( wave propagation direction ) .",
    "the foil is chosen to be thin enough for the laser beam to push out all electrons from the target . in this case ,",
    "only electrons are accelerated , while the ions are left unmoved .",
    "for this regime @xcite , the relativistic invariant parameter of the laser field @xmath14 must be larger than the normalized field arising from electron - ion separation : @xmath28 .",
    "here @xmath29 is the electron density ( @xmath30 for carbon ) and @xmath31 is the critical density .",
    "we assume laser radiation of @xmath32 and therefore @xmath33 .",
    "for the chosen thickness @xmath34 we have @xmath35 .",
    "thus , to fulfill the condition @xmath36 @xmath37 for all calculations we take @xmath38 for a laser beam of circular polarization and @xmath39 -for a linear one .",
    "although the electron density is overcritical , the target is much thinner than the skin depth and is therefore transparent for the laser beam .",
    "thus , from this target under the action of ultrashort laser pulse a superdense electron bunch as a thin sheath is formed and accelerated up to ultrarelativistic energies .",
    "hence , their motion is well described in a single - particle picture , i.e. we will solve relativistic equations of motion for macroparticles @xmath40 in the given electric @xmath41 and magnetic @xmath42 fields .",
    "here we have introduced normalized momentum @xmath43 , energy @xmath44 ( lorentz factor ) and have taken into account that charge to mass ratio of macroparticles is the same as for the electron .",
    "the laser beam is focused at the @xmath45 and propagates along the @xmath46 . for analytic description of such pulses of linear / circular polarization",
    "we will approximate corresponding electromagnetic fields as follow@xcite:@xmath47@xmath48@xmath49@xmath50 ,   \\label{ez}\\]]@xmath51@xmath52@xmath53 ,   \\label{hz}\\]]where @xmath54is the envelope function , @xmath55 is the parameter of ellipticity ; @xmath56 corresponds to a linear polarization and @xmath57  circular polarization , @xmath58 is the electric field amplitude , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the rayleigh length of the focused laser pulse with the waist @xmath62 in the focal plane @xmath45 , and @xmath63 is the deformed phase .",
    "the laser pulse has temporal profile @xmath64 with the pulse durations @xmath65 .     for circularly polarized wave with @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "there is no reflector - target . ]    the carbon target is situated at @xmath68 . for the numerical calculations",
    "the total number of macroparticles is taken to be @xmath69 and uniformly distributed in the target .",
    "the set of equations for the macroparticles has been solved using a standard fourth - order runge ",
    "kutta algorithm .",
    "as the employed laser pulse is of nonplane configuration , here there is acceleration effect of particles even in the field of a single pulse .",
    "however , the latter is small in accordance with the above mentioned lawson - woodward theorem @xcite , to assess of which we made simulations with a single pulse given by eqs .",
    "( [ ex])-([hz ] ) . for this setup",
    "the energy distribution in accelerated electron layer is shown in fig . 1 for various @xmath27 .",
    "calculation have been made for the circularly polarized wave with @xmath70 and @xmath38 ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "1 evidences , the residual acceleration because of nonplane character of a focused laser beam is small .",
    "meantime , as is seen from this figure in the laser field electrons reach ultrarelativistic energies . thus , to keep the energy gained from the wave field we propose to place a high-@xmath18 target near the position @xmath72 where electrons gain maximal amount of energy from the laser pulse .",
    "the purpose of the second target is twofold .",
    "first , it acts as a reflector for laser pulse , being practically transparent for electron bunch . as a consequence",
    ", we will get field - free ultrarelativistic electron bunch in the high-@xmath18 target .",
    "second , within this target with sufficiently large thickness the generation of @xmath1-ray and positrons take place due to the electron bunch ",
    "high-@xmath18 ion collisions . due to high density and thickness ( which should be much larger than skin depth ) of second target",
    "we will consider it as a perfect reflector .",
    "hence , one should solve the equations ( [ 1 ] ) taking into account also reflected wave .",
    "for the total electric @xmath73 and magnetic @xmath74 fields we will have : for@xmath75@xmath76while for @xmath77@xmath78@xmath79@xmath80@xmath81the typical picture of acceleration dynamics is shown in fig .",
    "2 , where energy distribution in accelerated electron layer is shown for various @xmath27 for the circularly polarized wave with @xmath70 .",
    "the reflector - target is situated at @xmath82 . as is seen from fig .",
    "2 , after the passing the second target we have field - free ultrarelativistic electron bunch .     for circularly polarized wave with @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "reflector - target is situated at @xmath82 . ]     for circularly polarized wave with @xmath83 and @xmath67 .",
    "reflector - target is situated at @xmath84 . ]     for linearly polarized wave with @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "reflector - target is situated at @xmath87 . ]    for the smaller waists @xmath62 the position of energy maximum takes place for the smaller interaction lengths @xmath88 . in fig .",
    "3 , we represent the results for circularly polarized wave with @xmath89 and @xmath38 . for this setup the reflector - target",
    "is situated at @xmath90 .",
    "we have made calculations also for the linearly polarized laser beam . in fig .",
    "4 , the results for linearly polarized laser beam ( @xmath56 ) with @xmath91 and @xmath39 ( @xmath92 ) are presented .",
    "as is seen from this figure , in the field - free region we have an ultrarelativistic electron bunch of energies @xmath93 .",
    "note that in the high-@xmath18 target due to the electron bunch ",
    "ion collisions the electrons will lose energy via the generation of @xmath1-quanta and positrons . hence",
    ", if one expects to obtain unperturbed electron bunch , the target thickness should be much smaller than the radiation length , otherwise along with primary bunch one will have substantial amounts of produced gamma - ray photons and positrons .",
    "this scenario is also of interest and will be considered in the next section .",
    "as is seen from the figures 1 - 4 , the energy distribution of accelerated electrons obtained by the laser - target interaction is usually broad with almost @xmath95 energy spread up to a cutoff energy .",
    "such electron bunches are not suitable for coherent effects , for example , to generate coherent radiation -free electron laser .",
    "however , such bunches of high energy - density can be used to obtain high - flux of positrons , hard @xmath1-quanta with possible applications in material science , medicine , and nuclear physics .",
    "note that in our scheme this can be implemented by all - optical means without use of large scale facilities such as nuclear reactors or conventional particle accelerators .",
    "one can use second target as a bremsstrahlung converter , leading to the emission of bremsstrahlung photons , the energy of which takes a maximum value equal to that of the accelerated electrons .",
    "then , the bremsstrahlung photons interacting with ions can produce electron - positron pairs .",
    "in other words , qed cascade can be developed .",
    "accurate calculations of @xmath1-quanta and positrons spectra in such targets require using monte carlo computer codes ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "monte and references therein ) .",
    "however , one can use relatively simple formulas @xcite for thin targets , when target thickness is smaller than the radiation length @xmath96:@xmath97where @xmath98 is the fine structure constant , @xmath99 is the density of ions , @xmath100 - is the electron classical radius . in particular , for gold ( @xmath101 , @xmath102 ) @xmath103 , and for tantalum ( @xmath104 , @xmath105 ) @xmath106thus , the @xmath1-quanta number distribution @xmath107 over energy @xmath108 obeys integro - differential equation @xcite:@xmath109here @xmath110 , and @xmath111 describes bremsstrahlung process , which in the case of complete screening is given by the formula:@xmath112where @xmath113 . the quantity @xmath114 in eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) is the target thickness measured in radiation lengths , @xmath115 is the electron / positron distribution function , that should be defined self - consistently .",
    "however , for small @xmath114 , in eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) we take @xmath116 , where @xmath117 is the distribution function at the entrance to high-@xmath18 target .",
    "thus , for small @xmath114 we have @xmath118 in the limit of low annihilation rates the positrons distribution function can be defined as @xmath119where @xmath120 describe pair production process , which in the case of complete screening is given by the formula @xcite : @xmath121    -quanta and positrons for the setup of fig .",
    "3 . ]",
    "thus , having at hand electron bunch distribution @xmath122 with the help of eqs .",
    "( [ gam ] ) and ( [ pos ] ) one can calculate hard @xmath1-quanta and positrons number distribution over energy .",
    "for the target thickness we take @xmath123 .",
    "we have made calculations for the setup of figures 3 and 4 . to obtain electron bunch distribution @xmath124 at the entrance",
    "to bremsstrahlung target we considered the effective area limited to the central zone between @xmath125 .",
    "the results of calculations are presented in figs 5 and 6 . in these figures , in the logarithmic scale it is shown the energy distribution functions for primary accelerated electrons , produced @xmath1-quanta , and positrons .",
    "as is seen from these figures , through two - target scheme one can produce dense electron / positron bunches and substantial amounts of @xmath1-quanta of energies up to @xmath2 mev .",
    "in particular , for fig . 6",
    "the number of photons in the range of @xmath126 is @xmath127 .",
    "we have proposed mechanism for generation of high energy - density particles bunches from nanotargets by single laser pulse of ultrarelativistic intensities .",
