    "we have defined @xmath16 , with @xmath17 and @xmath18 the transverse coordinates of the daughter partons , @xmath19 is the first coefficient of the qcd @xmath20-function , and @xmath21 is a renormalization scale at which the coupling is evaluated .",
    "in general , a nlo computation is expected to add a small @xmath22 correction to the lo result . however , this is not the case here since there are terms in the nlo kernel which get large in certain kinematic domains and invalidate the strict expansion in @xmath23 .",
    "these are collinear logarithms , i.e.  logarithms associated with very disparate transverse dipole sizes between successive emissions .",
    "more precisely , let s consider the regime @xmath24 that is , the parent dipole is the smallest one , a gluon is emitted far away at @xmath17 and another one even further at @xmath18 , while all dipoles remain small so that the scattering is weak",
    ". then the dominant nlo contribution involves the double transverse logarithm ( dtl ) in the single integration term in eq .  .",
    "moreover , a careful expansion of the kernel in the double integration term , reveals that there is also a single transverse logarithm ( stl ) .",
    "linearizing in the amplitude @xmath25 , assuming that the latter depends only on the magnitude of @xmath26 , relabelling some variables and putting everything together , we find that eq",
    ".   in the collinear region becomes @xcite @xmath27 to arrive at the above , we have dropped virtual terms , i.e.  terms proportional to @xmath7 , since largest dipoles scatter stronger .",
    "now it becomes evident that for large enough daughter dipole size @xmath28 , the nlo contribution can be comparable to , or even larger than , the lo one due to the presence of a large dtl and/or stl . e.g.  consider the simple , but realistic initial condition @xmath29 then the transverse integration in eq .   becomes logarithmic and the one - step in rapidity evolution gives @xmath30 therefore , for sufficiently small @xmath31 the perturbation series becomes unreliable and even more , since the large nlo correction is negative , the solution is unstable .",
    "this is indeed what has been observed in numerical solutions @xcite and is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : nlodtl ] .     unstable solution to the nlo bk equation @xcite .",
    "only the dtl of the nlo kernel is kept and the coupling is fixed at @xmath32.,scaledwidth=33.0% ]",
    "understanding the source of the large logarithms is necessary before trying to resum them to all orders .",
    "the dtl arises from diagrams in which the two successive gluon emissions are strongly ordered in light - cone time @xmath33 , thus its origin is in the kinematics .",
    "for example , let us examine the diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : double ] where we take @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "inspection of energy denominators of the type @xmath37^{-1}$ ] @xmath38 which appear in light - cone perturbation theory , shows that the largest logarithmic terms occur when the lifetimes ( or equivalently the light - cone energies @xcite ) of the two gluons are also strongly ordered , i.e.  when @xmath39 .",
    "different hookings of the two gluons lead to 32 diagrams like the one in fig .",
    "[ fig : double ] . adding all these contributions and integrating over transverse momenta we find in the collinear regime",
    "@xmath40 the step - function is the key element and arises by encoding the lifetime constraint . by further doing the longitudinal integrations and the one over the intermediate dipole size @xmath28",
    ", we obtain the part with the dtl in eq .  .",
    "thus , in order to resum the dtls to all orders , we need to take into account all the diagrams with an arbitrary number of gluons emissions , in which the gluons are not only strongly ordered in their transverse and longitudinal momenta , but also in their lifetimes .     typical diagram leading to a large dtl .",
    "the softer gluon @xmath41 is emitted after and absorbed before the harder one @xmath42.,scaledwidth=30.0% ]    the stl also arises from successive emissions in which the second gluon is much softer , both in transverse and longitudinal momenta , than the first one , but now it is the region @xmath43 which gives the relevant contribution .",
    "not surprisingly , the stl is of dynamical origin and is related to dglap evolution .",
    "this is supported by the fact that its coefficient @xmath44 is the first non - singular term in the small-@xmath45 expansion of the relevant anomalous dimension , that is @xmath46 =       \\frac{1}{\\omega } - a_1 + \\cdots.\\ ] ] this suggests that in order to resum such stls , it suffices to include @xmath47 as an anomalous dimension , i.e.  as a power - law suppression in the evolution kernel .    putting everything together , we arrive at the non - linear evolution equation @xcite @xmath48 which is of the lo bk type , but with two extra factors in the kernel that resum the stls and dtls",
    ", equation has been derived in @xcite . in momentum space and at the linear level",
    ", the bessel kernel has first appeared in @xcite . ] .",
    "clearly , when such factors are expanded in the second non - trivial order in @xmath23 they reproduce the large logarithmic terms of the nlo bk equation as presented in eq .  .",
    "in eq .   we have defined @xmath49 and similarly for @xmath50 , while @xmath51 . the positive sign in the power - law suppression is to be used in the regime in eq .  , while the minus sign is taken when @xmath52 and will resum stls arising from successive gluon emissions which are still softer in longitudinal momentum but harder in the transverse space .",
    "finally , one should note that @xmath53 in eq .   coincides with the physical amplitude @xmath7 only for @xmath54 , with @xmath55 the typical target scale , which is anyway the region in which high energy evolution can be trusted .",
    "there is one last source of potentially large nlo terms in the nlo bk equation .",
    "these are the logarithmic terms proportional to @xmath56 in eq .   and they can get large when the scales in their arguments become very disparate .",
    "the scale @xmath21 , which is the same one at which the coupling is to be evaluated in eqs .   and , must be chosen in a way to cancel such large logarithms .",
    "even though the choice is not unique , it is the hardest scale which determines the running .",
    "indeed , the smallest dipole prescription @xmath57 cancels the large logarithms in all dangerous regions .",
    "another option is to choose @xmath21 so that all @xmath58 terms vanish . since in the present work we also neglect all pure @xmath59 terms ,",
    "such a choice looks like the _ fastest apparent convergence _ scheme .",
    "one easily finds @xmath60 which is equivalent to @xmath61 in the extreme kinematical cases where one of the three dipoles is much smaller than the other two .",
    "we shall adopt one of the above two schemes , but we shall not consider the one introduced in @xcite and which has been extensively used so far in phenomenology , as it is plagued by certain peculiarities .",
    "contrary to what happens to the nlo bk equation in , the resummed one in eq .",
    "admits well - defined solutions , whether the coupling is fixed or it runs .",
    "such a stable solution is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nlores ] .",
    "the dtls , the stls and the running of the coupling individually suppress the evolution and hence the final cumulative `` speed '' is substantially suppressed when compared to the one of the lo evolution .",
    "given appropriate forms for the initial condition , in @xcite we have used the numerical solutions to the resummed bk equation in order to perform fits to the hera data @xcite for the @xmath62 reduced cross section ( for similar fits , without inclusion of the stls , see @xcite ) .",
    "given the range of validity for small-@xmath0 dynamics , we have restricted ourselves in the region @xmath63 and @xmath64 , where the upper limit @xmath65 in the photon virtuality has been varied even up to 400 gev@xmath66 . with 4 free parameters we obtain",
    "good fits with a @xmath67 per point around 1.1@xmath681.2 .",
    "they are also rather discriminatory : they favor ( i ) the running coupling version of the mclerran - venugopalan ( mv ) model as an initial condition and ( ii ) the two running coupling prescriptions @xmath61 and @xmath69 , with a slight preference to the former . whether or not we include the power - law suppression factor due the resummation of stls in eq .  , does not affect the quality of the fits , however it does lead to more physical values of the fit parameters . for completeness , let us point out that the evolution speed extracted from such fits is @xmath70 .",
    "it would be desirable to generalize eq .   to include the pure @xmath59 terms , but this may not change much in the phenomenology , since many of such contributions are taken into account by one of the fit parameters .",
