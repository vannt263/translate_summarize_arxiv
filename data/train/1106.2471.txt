    "big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) remains our earliest probe of the universe , and plays a central role in post - wmap cosmology .",
    "light element observations and bbn theory measure the cosmic baryon density ( @xmath8 ) ; comparison with the independent wmap measure of @xmath9 fundamentally tests the hot big bang @xcite .",
    "the result : deuterium observations spectacularly agree with wmap , as does helium ; in sharp contrast , the predicted primordial li is a factor @xmath10 2 above the best estimates of the li abundance in galactic halo star atmospheres @xcite",
    ". this discrepancy , between the cmb - predicted primordial li and the stellar abundance determinations , is the primordial lithium problem .    the lithium problem and possible solutions have recently been reviewed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a serious possibility is that nonstandard processes occurred during primordial nucleosynthesis , altering the lithium abundance ; dark matter decays can do this @xcite .",
    "a signature which would test this scenario is the production of the @xmath5li isotope at levels @xmath5li/@xmath6li @xmath11 @xcite , a ratio orders of magnitude larger than is found in standard bbn .",
    "indeed , recent observations of lithium isotopes in halo stars suggest @xmath5li at these levels @xcite . however , these results are highly controversial due to the difficulty of extracting isotope ratios from the thermally - broadened 6707   li i line",
    ".    the lithium problem may be even worse if there are additional sources of li which leave traces in the halo stars where li is observed . a very likely source of this kind is li produced by the interactions of pre - galactic or `` structure formation '' cosmic rays ( sfcrs ) which should be accelerated in cosmic shocks which accompany the infall of baryonic gas onto protogalaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the resulting non - primordial @xmath5li and @xmath6li production can be significant compared to their primordial levels @xcite and would need to be subtracted from halo star abundances to determine the true primordial levels .",
    "this both exacerbates the lithium problem but also opens the possibility of using li abundances in different cosmic environments to probe both the early universe and cosmic - ray acceleration in structure formation .",
    "lithium also plays a role in the primordial chemistry leading to the formation of the first stars .",
    "namely , the lithium hydride ( lih ) molecule @xcite contributes to the cooling of the dust - free primordial gas .",
    "current calculations suggest however that the impact of lih is not dominant due to the small primordial li / h abundance , but the chemistry of primordial lih is complex and a subject of ongoing interest @xcite .",
    "lithium thus takes a uniquely important role in the cosmology of the early universe .",
    "unfortunately , lithium is difficult to measure due to its tiny abundance : in the solar system , li / h @xmath12 10@xmath13 , while in metal - poor halo stars , li / h @xmath12 ( 1 - 2)@xmath1410@xmath15 . to date , optical spectroscopy of galactic stellar atmospheres has been the only probe of li in the early galaxy , and stubborn systematic uncertainties could account for the li problem .",
    "any alternative means of observing li in any source would be extraordinarily useful for many reasons , not least of which would be the different systematics .",
    "furthermore , to date there are no stellar observations of extragalactic li , and so any extragalactic information would shed qualitatively new light onto this problem .",
    "since the atomic lines of li have been so challenging to observe , we have chosen to search for the simplest li containing molecule , lithium hydride ( lih ) .",
    "lih has been searched for previously by @xcite toward b0218 + 357 , where the authors report a tentative detection in a system that is 5 km / s offset from the systemic velocity but within the co velocity profile .",
    "the lih molecular isotopomers have a _ v_=0 , _ j_=0 - 1 rotational transition at 443.95293 ghz ( @xmath6lih ) and 453.16028 ghz ( @xmath5lih ) @xcite .",
    "this region of the mm - wave spectrum is highly opaque through the atmosphere .",
    "however these lines are accessible in the 1 & 3 mm bands at the combined array for research in millimeter - wave astronomy ( carma ) for extragalactic sources in redshift ranges of _ z_=0.64 - 1.1 and 2.85 - 4.2 , respectively .",
    "our strategy for detecting lih in these redshift ranges is to search for interstellar lih absorption toward lensed quasars with high millimeter continuum flux density .",
    "the absorption originates from molecular clouds in the lensing galaxy along the line of sight",
    ". these galaxies should preferentially exhibit high optical depth in other atomic and/or molecular transitions , including h and co. there are only a few candidates known to date .",
    "the three best candidate lenses which meet these criteria are b0218 + 357 , pks1830 - 211 , and pks0201 + 113 .",
