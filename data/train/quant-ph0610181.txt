    "almost 60 years ago @xcite , casimir discovered an interesting macroscopic consequence of the zero point fluctuations of the electromagnetic field : an attractive force between uncharged parallel conducting plates .",
    "since then , the dependence of the casimir force with the geometry of the conducting surfaces has been the subject of several works @xcite . for many years ,",
    "the only practical way to compute the casimir energy for non planar configurations was the so called proximity force approximation ( pfa ) @xcite .",
    "this approximation is valid for surfaces whose separation is much smaller than typical local curvatures . due to the high precision experiments performed since 1997 @xcite ,",
    "there has been a renewed interest in the geometry dependence of the casimir force , and in particular in the calculations of the corrections to the proximity approximation .    in the last years",
    "there have been a number of attempts to compute the casimir forces beyond the pfa , using for example semiclassical @xcite and optical @xcite approximations , and numerical path - integral methods @xcite .",
    "large deviations from pfa for corrugated plates have been reported @xcite , and in recent months the casimir energy has been computed exactly for several configurations of experimental interest , as the case of a sphere in front of a plane , and a cylinder in front of a plane @xcite . as first suggested in @xcite ,",
    "the latter configuration is intermediate between the sphere - plane and the plane - plane geometries , and may shed light on the longstanding controversy about thermal corrections to the casimir force .",
    "there is an ongoing experiment to measure precisely the casimir force for this geometry @xcite .",
    "the configuration of two eccentric cylinders is of experimental relevance too @xcite .",
    "although parallelism is as difficult as for the plane - plane configuration , the fact that the concentric configuration is an unstable equilibrium position opens the possibility of measuring the derivative of the force using null experiments . up to now",
    ", the casimir interaction energy between two cylindrical shells has been computed semiclassically and exactly in the concentric case @xcite , and using the proximity approximation in the eccentric situation @xcite . in principle",
    ", one could consider experimental configurations in which a very thin metallic wire is placed inside a larger hollow cylinder . in this case , a more accurate determination of the casimir force is needed .",
    "the aim of this paper is to describe in detail the derivation of the exact casimir interaction energy for eccentric cylinders , initially reported by us in @xcite , and to compute analytically different limiting cases of relevance for casimir force measurements in this configuration . to this end",
    "we will use the mode summation technique combined with the argument theorem in order to write the casimir energy as a contour integral in the complex plane @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we derive an expression for the casimir interaction energy for any configuration invariant under translations in one of the spatial dimensions .",
    "when properly subtracted , this expression reduces to an integral over the imaginary axis , and is similar to expressions for the casimir energy derived using path integrals or scattering methods . in section 3",
    "we derive the exact formula for the interaction energy between eccentric cylinders and we analyze some particular cases of the exact formula .",
    "we first show the known results for the concentric case obtained from the exact formulation , and that it is possible to derive the interaction energy for the cylinder - plane configuration in the appropriate limit . in section 4",
    "we consider the exact formula in the limit of quasi concentric cylinders of arbitrary radii . we discuss two opposite limits of this exact formula : large and small separations between the metallic surfaces .",
    "in the first limit , we find that the casimir energy between a thin wire contained in a hollow cylinder has a weak logarithmic decay as the ratio between the outer and inner radii becomes very large . in the second limit ,",
    "we recover previous results obtained using pfa for quasi concentric cylinders .",
    "finally , section 5 contains the conclusions of our work .",
    "the casimir energy for a system of conducting shells can be written as @xmath0 where @xmath1 are the eigenfrequencies of the electromagnetic field satisfying perfect conductor boundary conditions on the surfaces of the conductors , and @xmath2 are those corresponding to the reference vacuum ( conductors at infinite separation ) . throughout this paper",
    "we use units @xmath3 .",
    "the subindex @xmath4 denotes the set of quantum numbers associated to each eigenfrequency . introducing a cutoff for high frequency modes @xmath5 , the casimir energy @xmath6 is the limit of @xmath7 as @xmath8 . for simplicity",
    "we choose an exponential cutoff , although the explicit form is not relevant .",
    "let us consider a general geometry with translational invariance along the @xmath9axis ( as for example very long and parallel waveguides of arbitrary sections ) .",
    "the transverse electric ( te ) and transverse magnetic ( tm ) modes can be described in terms of two scalar fields with adequate boundary conditions . in cylindrical coordinates , the modes of each scalar field",
    "will be of the form @xmath10 , where the eigenfrequencies are @xmath11 , and @xmath12 are the eigenvalues of the two dimensional laplacian @xmath13 the set of quantum numbers @xmath4 is given by @xmath14 .",
    "for very long cylinders of length @xmath15 we can replace the sum over @xmath16 by an integral .",
    "the result is @xmath17 from the argument theorem it follows that @xmath18 where @xmath19 is an analytic function in the complex @xmath20 plane within the closed contour @xmath21 , with simple zeros at @xmath22 within @xmath21 .",
    "we use this result to replace the sum over @xmath23 in eq.([exs ] ) by a contour integral @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a function that vanishes at @xmath12 for all @xmath23 ( and @xmath26 vanishes at @xmath27 ) .    in the rest of this section",
    "we will consider the particular configuration of two eccentric cylinders with circular sections of radii @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "we will denote the eccentricity of the configuration by @xmath30 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . the geometrical dimensionless parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 fully characterize the eccentric cylinder configuration .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the results of this section can be trivially extended to more general configurations , as long as they are translationally invariant along one spatial dimension .",
    "it is convenient to compute the difference between the energy of the system of two eccentric cylinders and the energy of two isolated cylindrical shells of radii @xmath28 and @xmath29 , @xmath33 where @xmath34 here @xmath35 is a function that vanishes at the eigenfrequencies of an isolated cylindrical shell of radius @xmath28 .",
    "therefore @xmath36 where @xmath37    to proceed we must choose a contour for the integration in the complex plane . in order to compute @xmath38 , and @xmath39 separately",
    ", an adequate contour is a circular segment @xmath40 and two straight line segments forming an angle @xmath41 and @xmath42 with respect to the imaginary axis ( see fig .",
    "the nonzero angle @xmath41 is needed to show that the contribution of @xmath40 vanishes in the limit @xmath43 when @xmath44 . for the rest of the contour ,",
    "the divergences in @xmath7 are cancelled out by those of @xmath45 and @xmath39 , as in the case of concentric cylinders @xcite .",
    "therefore , in order to compute @xmath46 we can set @xmath47 and @xmath48 , and the contour integral reduces to an integral on the imaginary axis .",
    "we find @xmath49 as we will see , @xmath50 is a real function - hence , the integral over @xmath51 in eq .",
    "( [ xx ] ) is restricted to @xmath52 . after some straightforward steps one can re - write this equation as @xmath53 as we have already mentioned , a similar expression can be derived for conductors of arbitrary shape , as long as there is translational invariance along the @xmath54-axis .",
    "it is worth noting that the structure of this expression is similar to the ones derived recently for the cylinder - plane geometry using path integrals @xcite , and for the sphere - plane geometry using the krein formula @xcite .",
    "in this section we derive the exact formula for the casimir energy between eccentric cylinders .",
    "we proceed in two steps : we first find the function @xmath25 with zeroes at the eigenfrequencies for the geometric configuration .",
    "then we obtain an explicit expression for the function @xmath55 , which involves a definition of the casimir energy as a difference between the energy of the actual configuration and a configuration with very large and separated conductors .",
    "the solution of the helmholtz equation in the annular region between eccentric cylinders has been considered in the framework of classical electrodynamics , fluid dynamics , and reactor physics , among others @xcite .",
    "the eigenvalues have been computed using different approaches , as for instance conformal transformations that map the eccentric annulus onto a concentric one .",
    "as the two dimensional helmholtz equation is not conformally invariant , the transformed equation has coordinate dependent coefficients and has to be solved numerically @xcite .",
    "as is well known , it is very difficult to compute the casimir energy from the numerical eigenfrequencies .",
    "it is more efficient to use the procedure outlined in section 2 , that only needs a function @xmath25 with zeroes at the eigenvalues .",
    "although for the eccentric annulus this function has been previously found in the literature @xcite , for the benefit of the reader we include here a derivation of this result .",
    "the electromagnetic field inside an eccentric waveguide can be described in terms of tm and te modes .",
    "the tm modes are characterized by a vanishing @xmath54 component of the magnetic field , @xmath56 .",

    "the te modes can be treated in the same fashion . for these modes",
    "the @xmath54 component of the electric field vanishes in the annulus region , @xmath76 .",
    "the perfect conductor boundary conditions imply that the normal component of the magnetic field should vanish on the conducting shells , so now we must impose neumann boundary conditions on the surfaces .",

    "the function @xmath55 that determines the casimir energy through eq.([xxx ] ) is the ratio of the function associated to the actual geometric configuration and the one associated to a configuration in which the conducting surfaces are very far away from each other .",
    "as the last configuration is not univocally defined , we will use this freedom to choose a particular one that simplifies the calculation .",
    "it turns to be convenient to subtract a configuration of two cylinders with very large ( and very different ) radii , but with the same eccentricity as that of the configuration of interest .",
    "we start considering the dirichlet modes .",

    "as the small distance limit is dominated by the large-@xmath23 modes , the key point in the derivation of the pfa from the exact expression of the casimir energy is the use of the uniform approximation for the bessel functions . in the large @xmath23 limit , and to leading order in @xmath200 one",

    "the evaluation of the non diagonal contribution to the casimir energy can be done using similar steps , starting from eq.([nondiagpart ] ) . in the proximity limit , we can approximate @xmath210 by @xmath211 in the denominator of that equation . therefore ,",

    "the uniform expansion for the ratio of bessel functions is equal to the expansion for the derivatives , i.e. , @xmath220^{\\pm 2 } , \\label{unifapprox2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and therefore all calculations can be repeated without changes .    the final result for the casimir interaction energy difference in the small distance approximation is @xmath221 where @xmath222 denotes the full electromagnetic casimir energy difference between eccentric and concentric configurations .",
    "7 depicts the ratio of the exact casimir energy difference @xmath223 and the pfa limit for the almost concentric cylinders configuration . as evident from the figure , pfa agrees with the exact result at a few percent level only for @xmath116 close to unity , and then it noticeably departs from the pfa prediction .",
    "the resulting pfa expression for the attractive casimir force between quasi - concentric cylinders reads @xmath224 that reproduces the result previously obtained in @xcite .",
    "we have derived an exact formula for the casimir interaction energy between eccentric cylinders using a mode summation technique .",
    "this formula is written as an integral of the determinant of an infinite dimensional matrix , and it reproduces as a particular case the interaction energy between concentric cylinders , and as a limiting case the energy in the cylinder - plane geometry . in the quasi - concentric case ,",
    "the infinite dimensional matrix becomes tridiagonal , and hence much easier to deal with than the exact formula when performing analytic and numerical calculations .",
    "we have carried out the numerical evaluation of the casimir interaction energy using both the exact and tridiagonal formulas , and studied different limiting cases of relevance for casimir force measurements .",
    "the large and small distance limits were analyzed . in the former case ,",
    "the casimir energy is dominated by the lowest modes , and shows a weak logarithmic decay , typical of cylindrical geometries . in the latter case ,",
    "the casimir energy is dominated by the highest modes , and the exact formula reproduces the proximity approximation .",
    "we found that the first order correction ( @xmath225 ) to pfa for the quasi - concentric cylinders has the form @xmath226 , where the coefficient of the linear curvature correction is positive , @xmath227 , both for te and tm modes .",
    "this contrasts with the first order corrections to pfa in the cylinder - plane configuration , where the linear curvature correction to tm modes is positive , while the one for te modes is negative @xcite .",
    "the exact casimir force computed in this paper , in particular for the quasi - concentric configuration , offers a qualitatively different approach for implementing new experiments to measure the casimir force and to search for extra - gravitational forces in the micrometer and nanometer scales , since it opens the possibility of measuring the derivative of the force using ( cavendish - like ) null experiments .",
