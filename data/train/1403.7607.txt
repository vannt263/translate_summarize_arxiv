    "protoplanetary disks evolve via turbulent viscosity , and their evolution has been well represented by the model of @xcite(1974 , henceforth lbp74 ) . in the lbp74 model , the rotation profile is assumed to be time - independent or simply keplerian .",
    "this assumption is justified if the radial pressure gradient is much smaller than the central star gravity .",
    "the temperature in the disks is generally low enough that the radial pressure gradient can be neglected in most parts of the disk .",
    "however , even in disks with low temperature , the radial pressure gradient may not be neglected in which the surface density dramatically varies in the radial direction .",
    "such regions appear , for example , at the gap edge formed by the gravity of planets , and at the boundary between the active and inactive regions for magneto - rotational instability . for such regions ,",
    "we need to modify the lbp74 model to take into account the change in the rotation profile .",
    "interestingly , the similarity solution of the lbp74 model has an exponential cut off at the outermost region ( lbp74 ; @xcite ) . in the outer edge of the disk ,",
    "the density decreases exponentially with a radial scale length , r0 .",
    "because the disk scale height , h , generally increases with the radius , the scale height becomes larger than the radial scale length at a certain point , resulting in a violation of the assumption of negligible pressure gradient .",
    "hence , even if there is no external force modifying the disk structure , such as photoevaporation or planets , the self - similar solution of the lbp74 model violates self - consistency at the outer edge of the disk .",
    "the recent development of high - sensitivity ( sub)millimeter interferometers makes it possible to observe surface density profiles of the outer regions of protoplanetary disks .",
    "the observations have suggested that the profiles are well fitted by a similarity solution of the disks ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ) , which has a sharp density profile at the outer edge .",
    "observations using facilities with high sensitivity , such as alma , however , are expected to reveal the lower density area in the outer region in which the radial pressure gradient force is non - negligible .",
    "because of this , it is important that we investigate the outer region of the disks without the assumption of keplerian disks .",
    "when the gas pressure gradient force becomes non - negligible compared with the gravitational force in the equation of motion in the radial direction , an assumption of keplerian rotation becomes inadequate .",
    "when we inappropriately adopt the assumption to a disk with a steep surface density profile and a large radial pressure gradient force , we often see rotational instability .",
    "rotational instability is one of the hydrodynamical instabilities in axisymmetric differentially rotating disks @xcite .",
    "the rayleigh s criterion is the discriminant for rotational stability ; for an inviscid disk to be rotationally stable , the specific angular momentum ( @xmath0 ) must monotonically increase with cylindrical distance from the axis of rotation ( @xmath1 ) in a flow : @xmath2 otherwise , the disk becomes rotationally unstable and the gas radially migrates with conserving specific angular momentum . in a viscid disk",
    ", viscosity limits the onset of rotational instability .",
    "also , in the rayleigh s criterion , the radial entropy gradient is not taken into account .",
    "we need to use the solberg - hoiland criterion @xcite for a disk with a radial entropy gradient , with which the rotational instability is easier to set in standard disks @xcite . in this paper , however , we simply adopt the rayleigh s criterion as the discriminant for rotational stability because we treat disks with low viscosity and the rayleigh s criterion is a more severe discriminant for rotational instability than the solberg - hoiland criterion .",
    "since the sharp edge could lead to rotational instability , in this paper , we investigate the condition under which the disk becomes rotationally unstable .",
    "we also analytically calculate the marginally stable surface density profile for rotational instability , which indicates that the profile becomes shallower than that of the similarity profile .",
    "the rotation velocity will be less than the keplerian velocity in the region where the disk is rotationally unstable .",
    "if the deviation from the keplerian velocity is observable , it will be evidence that the radial pressure gradient force is sufficiently strong in the region .",
    "we analytically examine the marginally stable disks for rotational instability in section 2 . in section 3 , we apply the result of section 2 for protoplanetary disks . we discuss the possibility of observations of non - similarity profiles and the validity of approximations used in this work in section 4 , and we summarize our conclusions in section 5 .",
    "although many discussions here are applicable to the outer region of accretion disks in general , we focus on protoplanetary disks in this paper .",
    "in this section , we analytically calculate the marginally stable surface density profile for rotational instability .",
    "then we connect the marginally stable profile to the similarity profile of viscous disks .",

    "<S> we analytically calculate the marginally stable surface density profile for the rotational instability of protoplanetary disks . </S>",
    "<S> the derived profile can be utilized for considering the region in a rotating disk where radial pressure gradient force is comparable to the gravitational force , such as an inner edge , steep gaps or bumps , and an outer region of the disk . in this paper , we particularly focus on the rotational instability in the outer region of disks . </S>",
    "<S> we find that a protoplanetary disk with a surface density profile of similarity solution becomes rotationally unstable at a certain radius , depending on its temperature profile and a mass of the central star . </S>",
    "<S> if the temperature is relatively low and the mass of the central star is high , disks have rotationally stable similarity profiles . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise , deviation from the similarity profiles of surface density could be observable , using facilities with high sensitivity , such as alma . </S>"
