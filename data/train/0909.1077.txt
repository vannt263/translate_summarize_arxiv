    "entanglement is a property of quantum states that does not exist classically .",
    "two or more subsystems of a quantum system are said to be entangled if the state of the entire system can not be described in terms of a state for each of the subsystems  @xcite .",
    "this property of composite quantum systems , which exhibits quantum correlations between subsystems , is a resource for many processes in quantum information theory  @xcite .",
    "since the profound measures of entanglement , i.e. the entanglement of formation and distillation  @xcite , have not been properly generalized to multiparticle systems , the study of quantifying multipartite entanglement via other measures  @xcite is a necessity .",
    "the entanglement of a given pure state can be characterized by a distance to the nearest unentangled state  @xcite . a whole class of such entanglement monotones , based on the euclidean distance of a given multipartite state to the nearest fully separable state ,",
    "was constructed in ref.@xcite .",
    "subsequently , a geometrically motivated measure of entanglement , known as geometric measure , was introduced by wei and goldbart  @xcite .",
    "it is a decreasing function of the maximal overlap @xmath1 and is suitable for any partite system regardless of its dimensions .",
    "the maximal overlap has several different names and we list all of them for the completeness : maximal probability of success  @xcite , entanglement eigenvalue  @xcite , injective tensor norm  @xcite , the largest schmidt coefficient  @xcite and maximum singular value  @xcite .",
    "the geometric measure has an advantage that it can be computed analytically for multi - parameter states .",
    "recently , explicit expressions for the maximal overlap have been derived for three-@xcite as well as for multi - qubit states  @xcite .",
    "it turned out that the maximal overlap , depending on coefficients of a quantum state in a computational basis , can take two different values .",
    "it is equal to either the square of the largest coefficient or the square of the circumradius of a cyclic polygon constructed by the coefficients of the quantum state .",
    "this means that the whole parameter space is divided into two subspaces each of which has its own expression for the geometric measure .    in spite of these achievements ,",
    "still we lack sufficient knowledge to classify generic three - qubit pure states by the geometric measure .",
    "they have five local unitary(lu ) invariants including four positive parameters and a gauge phase @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "the maximal overlap of these states is not known yet .",
    "only three - qubit states which are expressed as linear combinations of four(or less ) orthogonal product states have been considered so far  @xcite . in fact , all of these states have real coefficients because the phases of their coefficients can be eliminated by lu - transformations .",
    "thus , the contribution of the gauge phase to the maximal overlap has remained a mystery .",
    "on the other hand , the most recent results  @xcite have shown that the gauge phase plays an important role .",
    "it parameterizes the family of maximally entangled states and identifies w - class pure states with the boundary of pure states .    in this paper",
    "we would like to take into complete account the effect of the gauge phase in the geometric measure of entanglement .",
    "we compute the maximal overlap as well as the nearest product states for a given value of the gauge phase .",
    "we will show in the following that depending on the phase factor @xmath2 the whole parameter space is divided into the two or three domains , each of which has a particular expression for the geometric measure .",
    "in addition , we will show that most of highly entangled states reside near the boundaries of the domains . we will call these highly entangled states as ghz - neighbors .",
    "the states located far from the boundaries become less - entangled and eventually go to the product states .",
    "but there is different kind of the highly entangled states .",
    "these states reside around w - states .",
    "we will call these highly entangled states as w - neighbors .",
    "the w - neighbors are generally more entangled than the ghz - neighbors from the aspect of the geometric measure .",
    "however , the range of the ghz neighbors is much more wider than the range of the w - neighbors .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section ii following ref.@xcite we transform the nonlinear eigenvalue equations into the lagrange multiplier equations . in section iii",
    "we solve the lagrange multiplier equations analytically for @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "it turns out that both cases give five different eigenvalues .",
    "also every eigenvalue has its own available region in the parameter space . in section iv",
    "we compute the geometric measure for @xmath5 case .",
    "it turns out that two of the five eigenvalues contribute to the geometric measure .",
    "this means that the whole parameter space is divided into two applicable domains . in section v we compute the geometric measure for @xmath4 case .",
    "it is shown that the whole parameter space is divided into the three applicable domains . in section vi",
    "we compute the eigenvalues and the geometric measure for @xmath6 numerically .",
    "it is shown that when @xmath7 , there are six different eigenvalues . however , only two eigenvalues contribute to the geometric measure . in section",
    "vi a brief conclusion is given .",
    "in appendix we have shown that lagrange multiplier equations for arbitrary @xmath2 provides a solution whose multiplier constant is zero .",
    "in this section we clarify our notations , give necessary definitions , define three - qubit symmetric states and transform nonlinear stationarity equations to a system of linear equations .",
    "the maximal overlap of @xmath8-qubit pure states is given by @xmath9 where the maximization is performed over single qubit pure states .",
    "constituents @xmath10 , @xmath11 , ... ,",
    "@xmath12 , the nearest product state from @xmath13 , can be computed via the non - linear eigenvalue equations @xmath14 where @xmath15 s are the eigenvalues of eq.([nonlinear - ev ] ) .",
    "then the geometric measure @xmath16 of the quantum state @xmath13 is defined as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 .    for simplicity",
    ", we take a quantum states which possess a permutational symmetry  @xcite .",
    "these states have three independent parameters and , through an appropriate lu transformations , can be brought into the symmetric form  @xcite @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are positive and satisfy the normalization condition @xmath22 . the phase @xmath2 has the period @xmath23 and ranges within the interval @xmath24 .",
    "note that eq.([symmetric ] ) is not a schmidt decomposition for @xmath25 since the schmidt normal form imposes additional conditions(namely , a lower bound on @xmath26 ) on state parameters .",
    "we would like to abandon these additional constraints and apply the general method proposed in ref.@xcite to symmetric states eq.([symmetric ] ) .      in this subsection",
    "we would like to present the method for solving stationarity equations for the quantum state given in eq.([symmetric ] ) .",
    "in the case of three - qubit pure states the method developed in ref.@xcite transforms the system of nonlinear equations to a system of linear equations . in spite of this essential simplification",
    ", it is impossible to get analytic expressions for generic three - qubit states since the solution of the linear eigenvalue equations reduces to the root finding for a couple of algebraic equations of degree six  @xcite .",
    "however , the permutation symmetry of @xmath13 reduces this pair of algebraic equations to a single algebraic equation of degree six .",
    "furthermore , there is a solution which holds for all values of state parameters  @xcite .",
    "the separation of this global solution allows us to solve explicitly the eigenvalue equations for @xmath5 and @xmath27 and leads us to a quartic equation for remaining cases .",
    "the quartic is the highest order polynomial equation that can be solved by radicals in the general case . but",
    "expressions for roots are impractical and we will carry out numerical analysis instead .    the method enables us to express eigenvalues @xmath28 via the reduced densities @xmath29 and @xmath30 of qubits a and b in a form : @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 s are pauli matrices .",
    "explicit calculation shows @xmath34 it is worthwhile noting that @xmath35 is identical with @xmath36 and @xmath37 is a symmetric matrix .",
    "these properties arise due to the fact that we have chosen the symmetric state in eq.([symmetric ] ) under the qubit - exchange .",
    "as will be shown in the following these properties drastically simplify the calculation procedure .",
    "since @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are explicitly derived , the eigenvalues @xmath28 can be computed if @xmath38 and @xmath39 are known .",
    "due to the maximization in eq.([eigenvalue-1 ] ) these vectors can be computed by solving the lagrange multiplier equations : @xmath40 where the superscript @xmath41 stands for transpose and @xmath42 s are the lagrange multiplier constants . from the properties @xmath43 and @xmath44 eq.([lagrange-2 - 1 ] ) can be reduced to a single equation @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 . letting @xmath48 eq.([lagrange-2 - 2 ] ) reduces to    [ main-2 ] @xmath49",
    "@xmath50 @xmath51    solving @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 from eq.([main-2 ] ) , one can compute the eigenvalues for the symmetric canonical state ( [ symmetric ] ) by inserting the solutions into eq.([eigenvalue-1 ] ) . in the next section",
    "we will solve analytically eq.([main-2 ] ) at the particular phases @xmath3 and @xmath4 . by making use of the solutions we will compute @xmath15 and @xmath18 for the corresponding quantum states .",
    "in this section eq.([main-2 ] ) will be solved at @xmath3 and @xmath0 separately . since numerical calculation",
    "is needed to analyze the @xmath7 case , we deal with this case in different section ( see section vi ) .      for this case eq.([main-2 ] ) reduces to    [ ga-0 ] @xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath57    eq.([ga-0y ] ) implies that the solutions for the @xmath3 case are categorized by @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 can be excluded by eq.([ga-0x ] ) . ] .      when @xmath58 , eq.([ga-0x ] ) and eq.([ga-0y ] ) are automatically solved , and eq.([ga-0z ] ) gives @xmath62 now @xmath63 and eq.([eigenvalue-1 ] ) together with the normalization condition @xmath22 gives the eigenvalue @xmath64      for this case eq.([ga-0y ] )",

    "since , furthermore , @xmath91 and @xmath92 are invariant under @xmath88 and @xmath93 , this fact implies that the eigenvalues for this case are exactly same with those for @xmath59 case .      for this case eq.([ga-0y ] ) is automatically solved and the remaining equations are    [ couple-3 ] @xmath95 @xmath96    since eq.([couple-3x ] ) gives a relation @xmath97 combining eq.([couple-3z ] ) and eq.([phi - t-1 ] ) enables us to express @xmath98 and @xmath99 as @xmath100 for a time being we choose the upper sign in @xmath101 .",
