    "since the discovery of carbon nanotubes by iijima,@xcite a rich variety of carbon nanotube morphologies have been experimentally observed .",
    "carbon nanotubes ( cnt ) are very intriguing objects for both experimental and theoretical investigations due to the many unusual properties they exhibit .",
    "their potential for practical applications , especially in the area of nanotechnology , is very promising . among their many uses envisioned",
    "include applications in nanoscale electronic devices , field - emission displays and quantum wires.@xcite nanotube doping and structure modification result in the formation of heterojunctions,@xcite diodes,@xcite quantum dots,@xcite field effect transistors @xcite and one  electron conductors.@xcite    the dynamical properties of carbon nanotubes are of great interest due to their potential for useful practical applications.@xcite the theoretical methods for explaining these properties range from accurate _ ab initio _ methods to approximate empirical schemes .",
    "few of experimental findings , however , were analyzed using empirical methods that take into account harmonic contributions such as effects of different vibrational modes , explicitly .",
    "in particular , nonlinear localized excitations can transfer energy and be involved in various processes of interest .",
    "there have been some speculations on the role played by solitary excitations in heat transfer , polymer destruction and other processes occurring in molecular systems.@xcite while in most cases of interest harmonic approximation is sufficient to describe molecular processes , some molecular materials contain atoms interacting through nonlinear inter - atomic potentials which can give rise to soliton excitations .",
    "the investigation of these nonlinear effects is , therefore , interesting and timely .    in this work",
    "we investigate the nonlinear effects in carbon nanotubes giving rise to solitons using empirical methods .",
    "we employ brenner s nonlocal many - body potential for carbon systems.@xcite its simple analytical form as well as its reliability for carbon systems coupled with its computational efficiency makes it a natural candidate for such investigations .",
    "the nanotube chosen for our simulations is a @xmath0 tube containing 1000 - 11000 atoms .",
    "the simulations were performed for free , rigid and capped tube ends .",
    "our investigations include soliton stability , reflection from free and capped cnt ends , solitons collisions as well as the influence of thermal fluctuations .",
    "we find that the interaction of solitary excitations with the cnt cap can be either elastic or inelastic . in the latter case",
    "some part of the energy is retained as an internal excitation of the cap with the remaining portion distributed highly inhomogeneously over the c - c bonds .",
    "this effect is found to be most pronounced for the non symmetrical caps .",
    "the degree of energy concentration depends sensitively on the cap structure and solitary energy and profile .",
    "in some cases the energy of few bonds in the cap exceeds the average solitary energy by an order of magnitude or more .",
    "similar phenomenon is also observed for other defects in cnts .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ nonlinear ] we derive a nonlinear expansion of the brenner s potential for longitudinal and radial atomic displacements .",
    "[ korteweg ] contains the formulation of an analytical equation for the longitudinal displacements of atoms along the cnt axis . in this section",
    "we derive the one  dimensional korteweg  de  vries equation assuming angular homogeneity and neglecting the radial displacements and obtain the corresponding supersonic soliton solution .",
    "results of the numerical simulations of soliton behavior in cnts are given in sec .",
    "[ numerical ] .",
    "[ inter ] contains detailed analysis of solitary collisions with cnt defects .",
    "the possible soliton contributions to various chemical and physical properties of cnt are briefly discussed in sec .",
    "[ concl ] with special attention paid to the changes in the local density of states and variations in partial atomic charges at different instances of the soliton  cap interaction . along with summarizing our results ,",
    "we also propose possible ways of soliton generation in this section .",
    "carbon nanotubes ( only single  walled cnt are considered in this work ) are highly anisotropic and ordered objects with great aspect ratio .",
    "the cnt surface is formed by a graphitic sheet folded into a cylinder with bond lengths and angles differing slightly from graphite on account of the strain induced by the folding .",
    "the inter - atomic c - c potential is highly unharmonic and can be approximated using classical many - body potentials containing either exponential or power terms .",
    "generally , these potentials do not provide an exactly solvable dynamical equation in the nonlinear continuum approximation and , therefore , some approximations needs to be made in order to yield desired solutions .",
    "the unharmonic solutions in nonlinear 1d lattices are frequently approximated by the korteweg  de  vries ( kdv ) equation .",
    "since cnts are quasi1d objects , in order to obtain nonlinear excitations in cnt , it is reasonable to approximate cnt as a 1d lattice with nonlinear effective potential .",
    "we then make the continuum approximation for this system and derive the corresponding kdv equation .",
    "we obtain the nonlinear effective potential for cnt by expanding brenner s many body - potential in taylor series up to the third order terms .",
    "the corresponding newtonian equations of motion in finite differences are then derived and finally , the continuous analogue ( nonlinear partial differential equation ) for the system is obtained .",
    "this results in the kdv equation which describes longitudinal nonlinear excitations ( solitons ) in cnt .    according to brenner s many - body potential,@xcite the bond energy between adjacent atoms @xmath1 and @xmath2 is expressed as , @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are , respectively , exponential repulsive and attractive terms : @xmath6 , v^a(r_{ij } ) = 33.27\\,exp[-2.69\\,(r_{ij } -1.39)]$ ] .",

    "the reliability of brenner s potential has been demonstrated in many numerical calculations of carbon systems in different phases ( graphite , diamond , fullerenes and large clusters ) , in both ground state as well as in non - equilibrium states including chemical reactions.@xcite furthermore , the simple form of the potential allows us to easily derive analytical expressions for forces .",
    "this also allows efficient large scale simulations of the system using available computer resources .    in the present work we consider only armchair @xmath8 cnts .",
    "the procedure and results are similar in the case of zigzag @xmath9 nanotubes .",
    "we use the cylindrical coordinate system ( @xmath10 ) for obvious reasons and align the tube axis along z  axis ( fig .",

    "the coefficients @xmath45 in the first group have the largest absolute values and are mostly independent on the cnt diameter ( see table i ) . the coefficients in other groups ( @xmath46 and @xmath47 )",
    "have smaller numerical values but strong dependence on the cnt diameter : the larger the cnt diameter , the smaller the values of these coefficients .",
    "this indicates that the contribution from the longitudinal degree of freedom to the dynamical properties of cnt is dominant , and the role of other members decreases with the increase in the cnt diameters .",
    "we , therefore , consider only the longitudinal degree of freedom in the study of nonlinear dynamics .",

    "furthermore , no significant interaction with low  intensity raman  active tangential mode ( @xmath115 @xmath116 ) was observed .",

[ discrete ] .",
    "our results are in full agreement with the findings for the cnts , suggesting that the neglect of higher order terms in the expansion of brenner s many - body potential ( eqn .",
    "[ brenner ] ) is justified . the situation changes , however , if the radial degrees of freedom are allowed .",
    "the folding of the graphite sheet to form cnt results in the mixing of longitudinal and radial modes . as a result , equations of motion for these two modes now contain cross  terms , which can influence the behavior of a longitudinal soliton .",
    "the numerical simulation of the initial state evolution chosen in the form of longitudinal soliton in cnt ( eqn .",
    "[ sol ] ) with _ all _ allowed degrees of freedom shows the soliton to be less stable , with a slow dissipation of the initial energy through the harmonic radial oscillations .",
    "results of analytical analysis and detailed numerical investigations of the longitudinal  radial solitons will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "we next investigate the interaction of the solitons with nanotube caps .",
    "our results for the interaction of narrow ( @xmath117 ) solitons with non - local defects ( free tube ends and caps ) shows it to be inelastic with the excitation energy being distributed approximately evenly over all the bonds in this region .",
    "interesting effects can be expected in the case when the length scales of both the excitations and defects are comparable . towards this end , we perform a detailed numerical investigation of interaction of excitations with the cnt caps .",
    "solitons with @xmath118 carry too small an energy to induce any noticeable effects in the cap .",
    "so we used solitary excitations with other profiles .",
    "when a solitary excitation has a characteristic length scale much greater than the lattice constant the nonlinear effects can be ignored and can be treated within the harmonic approximation . furthermore , for long - wave excitations , the dispersion effects in harmonic approximation are not significant . in this case , an arbitrary excitation propagates along the harmonic chain with speeds close to the sound velocity with only a minimal change in its profile .",
    "we have examined the propagation of a longitudinal solitary excitation using the parameters @xmath119 $ ] with @xmath118 and @xmath120  .",
    "this excitation was found to be highly stable even when all degrees of freedom were allowed and survived the reflection from free ends .",
    "same results were obtained for solitary waves with other analytical profiles and similar widths and amplitudes .",
    "the other types of excitations studied included an excitation of the gaussian profile @xmath121 $ ] , also with @xmath118 and @xmath120  .",
    "although the soliton propagation is accompanied by a highly coherent and predominantly longitudinal displacements of the atoms on the cylindrical surface of the cnt , the atoms on the cap behave quite differently after the solitary wave  cap collision .",
    "when the solitary excitation reaches the cap , there is an accumulation of energy at the cap .",
    "part of the total energy of the solitary wave is likely to be dissipated and/or accumulated on structural defects .",
    "we consider an example in which solitary wave interacts with non symmetrical caps .",
    "our simulation of soliton interaction with the nanotube cap consisted of the following sequences : ( a ) the incoming excitation causes the cap to `` inflate '' with the cap attaining nearly a spherical shape . at this instant",
    "the potential energy of the cap attains a maximum value , although the energy distribution in the bonds are unequal due to the asymmetry in the cap .",
    "atoms in the tip of the cap are displaced by @xmath122  in the positive @xmath12direction ; ( b ) the recoil of the elastic energy of the cap causes atoms to move in the opposite direction and at some instant the kinetic energy attains a maximum value .",
    "the velocities of atoms are all predominantly directed along the @xmath12axis although they differ significantly from each other in their magnitudes ; ( c ) atoms at the cap continue to be propelled by inertia and the elastic potential energy attains a maximum again . at this instant ,",
    "the cap acquires regions with negative curvature , and the displacement of the tip of the cap from its equilibrium position is @xmath123  ; ( d ) after this the atoms in the cap start to move in the opposite direction toward the equilibrium state and second , but less intense , maximum in the kinetic energy is observed .",
    "the nanotube cap continues to oscillate with rapidly decreasing amplitude , the energy being dissipated in heating the cap and the cnt `` body '' .",
    "note the large total amplitude of the tip displacements ( @xmath124  ) .",
    "a striking feature of this preliminary results observed in md simulations is the inhomogeneity of the energy distribution in the cap after the solitary wave ",
    "cap collision .",
    "we next investigate the cap dynamics and energy distribution over atoms in more details .    a typical time dependence of the kinetic energy distribution over atoms in the @xmath0 cap is shown in fig .",

    "are not shown as they have lower ( @xmath126 ev ) excitation levels .",

    "one can see that the kinetic energy is concentrated mainly at the tip of the cap and irrespective of the location of pentagons .",
    "we denote this effect of energy concentration as `` tsunami effect '' ( named for the effect explaining ocean waves coming to a beach ) because initially long  wave and low ",
    "amplitude excitation is concentrated into a sharp impulse of energy if the conditions for the solitary wave propagation are changed in a special manner .",
    "it was found that this effect depends on the cap structure and is more pronounced in less symmetrical caps .",
    "the effect is observed if the cap radius is comparable with solitary wave half  width @xmath96 ( in the case shown in fig .",
    "[ soliton_fig7 ] for @xmath118 ) . otherwise , the tsunami effect is less prominent .",
    "analogously similar phenomena with varying degrees of perfections were observed for other defects ( kinks and bends ) in cnt .",
    "we have also calculated electronic properties of the capped cnts during the solitary wave ",
    "cap collision using a generalized tight binding scheme of menon and subbaswamy.@xcite the variation of the partial mulliken charge distribution obtained using this scheme is shown in fig .",
    "[ soliton_fig7 ] .",
    "these calculations were performed for time instants corresponding to the maximal cap distortions ( stages ( a ) and ( c ) ) . the most significant change , as expected , is observed for atoms at the tip of the cap ( indicated by large number lables in fig .",

    "we have , thus , demonstrated analytically and using numerical simulations that the kdv solitons are reasonably good approximations for the description of nonlinear excitations in cnts .",

    "interestingly , at some instances the energy in a few bonds considerably exceeds the averaged energy of solitary excitation . this process can provide extra dynamical contribution to the recently discovered phenomenon of the enhanced reactivity of defect sites in cnts termed `` kinky chemistry''.@xcite    the issues concerning ways of solitons excitation in real cnts and their possible contribution to various chemical and physical phenomena are not yet clear . in reality",
    ", the generation of the highly coherent ultra short longitudinal displacements of atoms in the cnt seems hardly probable .",

    "they can also be generated due to external factors such as electron or ion impacts , stress release and other mechanisms .",
    "if solitary excitations do exist in cnts in reasonable `` concentration '' , then they can be identified through their contribution to some detectable cnt properties .",
    "a possible example is the tsunami effect when the energy , smoothly distributed in the large scale excitation of an arbitrary profile , can be concentrated on a few bonds of a defect with considerable energy excess .",
    "the greater the distortions in cnts , the greater is this influence .",
    "it can also be a way for a `` self  healing '' of cnts when a rearrangement of structural imperfection is activated by solitary excitations .",
    "this effect also can promote chemical reactions such as @xmath134 incorporation into nanotube caps .",
    "the high specific heat of a rope of swnt observed@xcite can be partially explained by solitary excitations generated in parallel with phonons .",
