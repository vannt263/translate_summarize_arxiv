    "the propagation of pathological states is a particular aspect within the complex bidirectional relation between migraine and stroke @xcite . here",
    "we investigate this aspect , in particular , how cortical tissue when modeled as an excitable medium becomes susceptible to spreading events .",
    "our knowledge about the mechanisms of propagation is still incomplete .",
    "it is generally believed that a common reaction - diffusion process , called _ cortical spreading depression _ ( csd ) @xcite , captures essential features of the observed spreading phenomena during migraine and stroke .",
    "what makes cortical tissue susceptible to csd has not been determined .",
    "since the smooth lissencephalic cortex of animals is much more susceptible to csd than the convoluted cortex of human , it was suggested that csd in humans occurs very close to the onset of this emergent property @xcite .",
    "classical measurement of electrophysiological changes during cortical spreading depression  @xcite .",
    "upper four traces : logarithmic representation of changes in @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 concentration , lower two traces : extracellular potential shift @xmath5 , and recording from a single neuron ( single unit activity ) vs. time .",
    "( modified from @xcite ) ]    csd is locally characterized by a nearly complete temporary breakdown of _ ion homeostasis _ , i.e. , a stable stationary state ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sdcharakter ] ) @xcite .",
    "most electrophysiological changes follow a similar temporal course and return to normal after about one minute .",
    "a prominent signal is the slow negative potential shift @xmath5 during csd .",
    "it led to the term _ spreading depolarization _",
    "( sd ) to classify this and related phenomena as depolarization waves in the cerebral cortex @xcite .",
    "example of related phenomena are sd waves that contribute to progressive deterioration in regions surrounding an infarct core in stroke patients .",
    "these sd waves are called periinfarct depolarizations ( pid ) @xcite .",
    "we use the term sd for both cortical spreading depression and periinfarct depolarizations in this paper . in this terminology spreading depolarization",
    "is the more general term .",
    "the respective form of sd depends mainly on differences in the energy state of cortical tissue .",
    "in particular , differences between csd and pid concern increased blood flow compensating the increased energy demands , which is typical for csd occurring in healthy tissue during migraine but is reduced or missing in pid during stroke .",
    "differences in brain regions , e.g. , concerning the cytoarchitecture or the distribution of ion channel types , also modify sd",
    ". we disregard the detailed pathophysiological characterization of the process , because it is still incompletely understood . instead , in this study , sd is modeled with a standard reaction - diffusion system of activator - inhibitor type .",
    "differences are reflected in the choice of the parameter values of the system .",
    "we extend the reaction - diffusion model by different kinds of local feedback signals .",
    "we propose that one way to think of such local feedback signals is in terms of control @xcite . in this view",
    ", the feedback represents intrinsic cortical control mechanisms that reduce cortical susceptibility for csd by stabilizing the physiological state of cortical tissue .",
    "consequently , their failure under certain pathological conditions leads to the emergence of csd , e.g. , attributed to an underlying cortical hyperexcitability in migraine @xcite or due to low energy levels in ischaemic tissue during stroke @xcite .    in this study ,",
    "different feedback mechanisms with characteristic time and space scales are considered .",
    "possible physiological basis of the feedback signals are motivated and discussed .",
    "we find that the excitability of the reaction - diffusion system can either increase or decrease .",
    "for each considered feedback scheme mainly the sign of the coupling strength determines whether feedback can suppress wave propagation , i.e. , stabilize the homogeneous steady state of the tissue .",
    "a specific feedback scheme , in which activator and inhibitor variables are cross - coupled by non - local connections , indicates that opposed signs in the coupling strength for short - range and long - range connections are favorable for controlling the homogeneous steady state .",
    "this is a typical neuronal network connectivity pattern called _ mexican - hat connectivity_.",
    "while all evidence suggests that a reaction - diffusion process captures the essential features of sd , it is also clear that some features are oversimplified if we model sd with a standard reaction - diffusion mechanism of activator - inhibitor type . to create a more accurate albeit still generic model , we extend the standard reaction - diffusion model by a feedback mechanism . we introduce the feedback signal pathway in two variations .",
    "first , we introduce long - range connections as a spatial coupling in addition to diffusion .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that high - frequency spikes in the population activity were observed up to millimeters ahead of the approaching front of sd @xcite .",
    "second , we consider a localized time delayed feedback in the cortex , which can account for a slow feedback signal originating from the neurovascular coupling .",
    "mathematically , these two extensions can be viewed as two limit cases of a general signal pathway ( fig .",
    "[ fig : signal ] ) .",
    "such a pathway serves as an additional coupling mechanism that is not included in a standard reaction - diffusion model . with this approach",
    ", we aim to describe universal features of excitable media modified by a feedback loop .    ) and temporal ( @xmath6 ) characteristics ( solid line ) of the feedback signal , which is used to extend the fitzhugh - nagumo ( fhn ) reaction - diffusion model .",
    "one of the two fhn variables is fed back via connections with length @xmath7 .",
    "the length is defined by the radial coordinate @xmath8 of a local polar coordinate system , which lies parallel to the cortical surface and has its origin located where the connection terminates . due to a finite propagation velocity @xmath9 and a latency time @xmath10 of the feedback signal , a total time delay @xmath11 occurs .",
    "a kernel function @xmath12 describes the spatial distribution of the connections , here exemplarily represented by a gaussian ( dashed ) .",
    "two physiologically motivated limit cases of this general feedback type are considered : @xmath13 instant feedback along long - range connections , and @xmath14 local time - delayed feedback .",
    "[ fig : signal ] ]      we model the propagation of an initially localized breakdown of ion homeostasis in cortical tissue ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sdcharakter])by an activator @xmath15 and an inhibitor @xmath16 as dynamic variables .",
    "they are coupled by kinetic reaction rates @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "we assume that only the activator species diffuses in the medium .",
    "the equations are @xmath19 the parameter @xmath20 is the time scale ratio in the local dynamics of activator and inhibitor variables .",
    "the local spatial coupling is introduced by the diffusion term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : udot ] ) with the diffusion coefficient @xmath21 . without loss of generality",
    ", the value of @xmath21 is normalized to unity .",
    "the choice of this value only scales the spatial coordinate .    in principle , there are two approaches to obtain the reaction rates @xmath17 and @xmath18 . in a bottom - up approach , the reaction rates must be derived from a microscopic biophysical model of sd , where all major electrophysiological properties are represented .",
    "there is no consent so far on the mechanism of sd .",
    "some models aim to provide a complete but rather local description of sd @xcite , that is , for processes occurring in a single neuron and its surrounding compartments .",
    "these models often introduce more than 20 dynamical variables .",
    "therefore , a bottom - up approach with a subsequent reduction to two major activator and inhibitor agents seems not to be amenable .",
    "nevertheless , it was shown that a two - species activator - inhibitor model can reproduce the spatio - temporal pattern of sd @xcite .",
    "even a reaction - diffusion model with a single species was successfully introduced for the purpose of an order - of - magnitude estimate of the expected propagation velocity of sd @xcite .",
    "such calculations follow essentially a top - down approach , which we also adopt here . the basic activator - inhibitor mechanism , which we describe in the next paragraph , can be further expanded ( top - down ) to facilitate detailed investigation of further pathways and variables relevant to the study of specific questions concerning sd .",
    "successful examples of such an approach are computational studies @xcite that supported a controversial hypothesis , namely that cortical tissue surrounding an infarct core dies because of the metabolic stress imposed by multiple sd waves .    the variables @xmath15 and @xmath16 assume the roles of activator and inhibitor , respectively .",
    "their kinetic functions @xmath17 and @xmath18 are given by a cubic nonlinearity and a linear function , respectively , @xmath22 with parameters @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "this is the fitzhugh - nagumo ( fhn ) system , which is widely used as a generic model of excitable media @xcite .",
    "before we introduce the feedback , we compare the simulated spatial - temporal patterns with the ones observed during sd .",
    "in particular , the pulse profile and velocity in the fhn system are related to the corresponding quantities in sd ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sdcharakter ] ) .",
    "following this approach , we can estimate realistic values of the parameters of the fhn system .      to extend the standard fhn reaction - diffusion model",
    "we assume that a nonlocal feedback signal @xmath26 is coupled back into the medium at any point @xmath27 as @xmath28 where @xmath8 and @xmath29 are the radius and the azimuthal angle , respectively , of a local polar coordinate system in @xmath27 that lies parallel to the cortical surface , i.e. , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 .",
    "the variable @xmath32 may be chosen as either the activator @xmath15 or the inhibitor @xmath16 .",
    "the function @xmath12 is the kernel function describing the spatial distribution of the pathway , which is typically peaked at a distance @xmath33 , and @xmath34 is the coupling strength .",
    "the parameter @xmath35 , with @xmath36 , is a time delay composed of a latency @xmath10 and a propagation delay @xmath37 .",
    "the latter is due to the finite signal propagation velocity @xmath9 . a schematic diagram of the signal @xmath26 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : signal ] .",
    "the feedback is , on the one hand , characterized by the parameter @xmath6 , and the kernel function @xmath12 , i.e. , @xmath7 .",
    "we call this characterization the _ type of coupling _ of the feedback signal . on the other hand ,",
    "there are two choices of @xmath32 , namely the activator @xmath15 and the inhibitor @xmath16 .",

    "this allows for four different combinations , named _",

    ", the signal @xmath26 tends to zero if the pattern is homogeneous and stationary .",
    "the motivation for such a feedback is that this choice eliminates the feedback signal in the case of successful suppression of wave propagation .",
    "the signal @xmath26 can be viewed as an intrinsic noninvasive control because it preserves the homogeneous steady state as the fixed point of the uncontrolled ( @xmath47 ) fhn system . in this way",
    ", it can be compared with the common time - delayed feedback control method introduced by pyragas @xcite .",
    "this method has been widely used with great success in problems in physics , chemistry , biology , and medicine @xcite including reaction - diffusion systems @xcite . in particular , it was demonstrated that it can be used to control the coherence and the timescales of noise - induced oscillations in a single fhn system @xcite and in two coupled excitable fhn systems @xcite as well as noise - induced patterns in reaction - diffusion systems @xcite and wave propagation in excitable media @xcite .",
    "this motivates our efforts to investigate whether a failure of such an intrinsic noninvasive control scheme can explain the onset of excitation spread in a spatially continuous fhn systems as a model of spreading pathological processes in the cortex during migraine and stroke .      _",
    "e$ ] , the extracellular potential shift @xmath5 , and the single unit activity are schematically related to the pulse on the lateral front surface .",
    "note that the size of the different cells types are enlarged by about a factor of 10 in relation to these measured signals .",
    "the two considered feedback mechansim are also illustrated : ( i ) long - range instantaneous lateral connections of length @xmath7 between neurons ( shown on the lateral front surface ) , ( ii ) a time delayed feedback control ( @xmath6 ) of pyragas type due to local response of the neurovascluar unit ( indicated on the right lateral side surface ) .",
    "[ fig : nvc ] ]    the first type of coupling that we consider is a limit case of eq .",
    "( [ eq : s ] ) .",
    "it is motivated by the observation of increased neuronal activity millimeters ahead of the approaching sd front .",
    "although the cause and the effect of this activity remains unclear , it can be assumed that such activity is induced by sd via lateral cortical connectivity patterns ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nvc ] ) . in this case",
    "the signal propagation velocity @xmath9 is several orders of magnitude faster than the velocity @xmath48 of sd , i.e. , ( @xmath49 in physical units ) .",
    "consequently , the propagation delay @xmath37 can be neglected .",
    "furthermore , the time scale of typical changes in electrophysiological activity is much faster than the time scale of changes due to the breakdown of ion homeostasis .",
    "the latter time scale is of the order of seconds ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sdcharakter ] ) , which is also in agreement with our simulations of the fhn system if we dimensionalize the model equations ( see section iii below ) , while the former time scale , i.e. , the delay due to chemical or electrical transmission at synapses , is of the order of milliseconds .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to assume that the latency @xmath50 of @xmath26 is much smaller than the time scale of sd and that @xmath50 can also be neglected .",
    "this assumption can fail for metabotropic ion channels , like metabotropic glutamate receptors , which have increased open probabilities in the range of seconds after their activation . however , for ionotropically mediated activity we assume that @xmath51 and @xmath52 , and therefore that the additional coupling signal @xmath26 is , in this case , an instantaneous process ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the connectivity pattern is rather localized around the typical coupling length @xmath7 , and therefore , restricting ourselves to one spatial dimension , @xmath54 , we approximate the kernel function by @xmath7-functions @xmath55 . taking these limits , eq .",
    "( [ eq : s ] ) reduces to @xmath56 note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : ddc ] ) only in the limit @xmath57 becomes a standard diffusion term , however , for large @xmath7 , as considered here , it adds a novel type of nonlocal spatial coupling to the fhn model .",
    "the second type is also a limit case of eq .",
    "( [ eq : s ] ) .",
    "we consider a scenario that takes into account the coupling within the neurovascular unit .",
    "therefore , it is particularly important for the dynamics of periinfarct depolarizations during stroke progression .",
    "the cerebral blood flow ( cbf ) is tightly regulated by the neurovascular unit to meet the brain s metabolic demands .",
    "these demands are extremely high during sd .",
    "the dynamics of the neurovascular unit are governed by various different cells types ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nvc ] ) .",
    "the interaction takes place between endothelial cells building the vessel walls , mural cells controlling vessel diameter , and glia and neurons . for the purpose of our simplified scheme , that is , describing universal features of reaction - diffusion models of sd modified by an additional signal pathway , we concentrate on some key features of blood flow regulation that occur within the time and space scale given by a single passage of sd and that mimic the influence of the neurovascular unit .",
    "the local cbf starts at arterioles , that is , blood vessels that extend and branch out from an artery and lead to capillaries .",
    "capillaries are the smallest vessels , measuring @xmath58 in diameter .",
    "they form the capillary bed , a local network supplying the brain tissue .",
    "the cbf is regulated by two types of mural cells .",
    "smooth muscle cells regulate arterioles , and pericytes regulate capillaries .",
    "the majority of the innervation of cerebral blood vessels terminate near capillaries suggesting that blood flow control is initiated in capillaries @xcite .",
    "therefore , we need to consider that increased activity during sd produces an initially localized hemodynamic response evoked by pericytes . to describe the action of the neurovascular unit on sd",
    ", the temporal and spatial distribution of the hemodynamic response needs to be considered .",
    "first , we consider the spatial distribution of the hemodynamic response , which is determined by the vascular architecture .",
    "a precise spatial coordination of segmental vascular resistance is needed to effectively increase blood flow in a larger cortical area .",
    "propagated vascular response signals are utilized to achieved this .",
    "it was shown that after the pericytes evoke a local capillary constriction , a pulse of constriction propagates at about @xmath59 to distant pericytes @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a dilatory signal mediated by release of vasoactive agents propagates from metabolically active cells and evokes a remote response in upstream precapillary arterioles @xcite .",
    "considering the slow velocity of @xmath59 we can assume that global effects mediated by arterioles take place behind sd , i.e. , after its passage , and therefore do not have a direct influence on the propagation of the wave front having passed .",
    "we assume that the response of the capillaries is rather localized , so that we can approximate the kernel function @xmath60 .",
    "consequently there is only a local response .",
    "still there exists a latency delay @xmath50 due to slow metabolic effects when a local hemodynamic response is evoked by pericytes .",
    "taking these limits , eq .",
    "( [ eq : s ] ) now reduces to @xmath61 which is identical with the noninvasive time - delayed feedback signal first introduced by pyragas @xcite for chaos control .",
    "this control method will now be applied to travelling pulses in excitable media .",
    "the latency delay time @xmath6 will be varied in our simulations .",
    "note that during stroke progression , the recruitment of periinfarct tissue into the infarct core is probably mediated by wave trains of periinfarct depolarizations @xcite .",
    "such periodic wave patterns are likely to be influenced by large scale hemodynamic responses .",
    "after the leading sd has initiated a slow propagating wave of constriction @xcite , subsequent waves in the wave train formation can be influenced by this .",
    "this is beyond the scope of our study . to model a single sd pulse",
    ", we include the neurovascular unit by a localized time - delayed feedback signal @xmath62 evoked from the change in blood flow which in turn is caused by pericytes in response to changes in neural activity .",
    "it was suggested that sd in humans occurs close to the bifurcation of the onset of spreading activity in excitable media @xcite .",
    "therefore , we first determine the location of this onset in the fhn system",
    ". then we estimate the parameters of the fhn system from experimental data on sd ( fig .",

    "[ fig : kdeltatau ] b ) and the value @xmath117 for @xmath39 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : kdeltatau ] c ) lies in the center of the control domain with the short range connections . if we consider the four cases in which pulses are suppressed , the location of the propagation boundary is shifted into the excitable regime , indicated by differently colored regions in fig .",
    "[ fig : pbs ] a ) .",
    "it is evident that the @xmath42 and @xmath43 cross coupling schemes are most efficient .",
    "note that for the least efficient coupling scheme ( @xmath38 ) the propagation boundary ( edge of the green region in fig .  [ fig : pbs ] a ) is actually not shifted beyond the point @xmath105 and @xmath106 ( black dot ) .",
    "this seems to be contradictory with the control domain shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kdeltatau ] a ) but is consistent with the definition of the propagation boundary as a bifurcation line . beyond this bifurcation line there",
    "do not exist any traveling pulse solutions , whereas fig .",
    "[ fig : kdeltatau ] a ) only states that a specific traveling pulse solution with a specific amplitude ( the one of the uncontrolled system ) is suppressed .",
    "this example illustrates the different nature of the information shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kdeltatau ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : pbs ] . in the four cases with the opposite sign of the parameter value @xmath34 , i.e. , where pulses are not suppressed",
    ", the propagation boundary is shifted towards the non - excitable regime of the uncontrolled ( @xmath47 ) fhn system ( dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : pbs ] a ) .",
    "second , we consider the local , time - delayed type of coupling @xmath62 .",
    "the parameter values for @xmath62 are set to @xmath117 and @xmath118 , and @xmath120 . to provide a comparison with the former type of coupling @xmath63",
    ", we also choose the short range domain ( as for @xmath63 in fig .",
    "[ fig : kdeltatau ] b , c ) as the reference point and use these values of @xmath34 also for @xmath62 .",
    "as before they are marked by green dots in fig .",
    "[ fig : kdeltatau ] e , f , g if control is successful and red otherwise . only for the scheme ( @xmath40 ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig : kdeltatau ] h ) both types of coupling for @xmath118 and @xmath117 lie outside the control domain .",
    "since the type with @xmath118 is closer to a control domain , this is marked green , and correspondingly its propagation boundary is slightly pulled back as indicated by the red region in fig .",
    "[ fig : pbs ] b. again we find a similar pattern as for the non - local type of coupling @xmath63 .",
    "the coupling schemes that suppress pulse propagation reduce excitability ( colored regions in fig .",
    "[ fig : pbs ] b ) and the other ones increase excitability ( dashed lines ) .",
    "note that also for the coupling scheme ( @xmath40 ) this pattern occurs , with the only difference that the propagation boundary ( edge of the red region in fig .",
    "[ fig : pbs ] b ) is not shifted beyond the point @xmath105 and @xmath106 ( black dot ) , which is in agreement with the control domain shown in fig .  [ fig : kdeltatau ] g.",
    "we have shown that a weakly excitable reaction - diffusion system can be shifted across the boundary of pulse propagation ( fig .  [",
    "fig : pbs ] ) by various types of feedback and coupling schemes .",
    "in particular , we use non - local feedback @xmath63 and time - delayed feedback @xmath62 . on the one hand , this is motivated by physiological considerations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nvc ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "these two distinguished types allow for a clear separation of the effect of the introduced space scale @xmath7 and time scale @xmath6 upon the spatio - temporal pattern of sd .",
    "we have shown that these scales @xmath7 and @xmath6 are closely related .",
    "the reason is , of cource , that the feedback is applied to control of travelling pulses .",
    "the velocity of sd relates space to time scales .",
    "their numerical values can be compared after normalizing them with the pulse width @xmath82 and pulse duration @xmath83 , respectively . the common effect of both types of feedback on the traveling pulse is then reflected in the similar location of optimal control around half the pulse width and pulse duration for @xmath63 and @xmath62 , respectively ( fig .",
    "[ fig : kdeltatau ] ) .",
    "therefore , the feedback mechanism , as given in a general form in eq .",
    "( [ eq : s ] ) , and illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : signal ] , provides a generic mechanism to modulate excitability in reaction - diffusion systems even if we consider only its two limit cases .",
    "the reaction - diffusion system we have used to demonstrate the modulation of excitability by feedback is the fhn model .",
    "it represents excitable media exhibiting excitability of type  ii .",
    "furthermore , we have constrained our investigations to the section @xmath66 and @xmath75 in the four - dimensional parameter space of this model . both restrictions , excitability of type ii and this choice within the parameter space , will now be discussed .",
    "type  ii excitability is related to a hopf bifurcation , which is characterized by the fact that a periodic state bifurcates with a nonzero frequency @xcite . within an exponentially small range of either @xmath24 or @xmath20 after the hopf bifurcation",
    "a transition occurs , called _ canard explosion _ , from a state with small amplitude oscillations to a large amplitude relaxation oscillation .",
    "the canard explosion produces the threshold behavior ( all - or - none ) of the system needed to exhibit excitable behavior . another typical bifurcation scenario leading to excitability is that the periodic state appears at a zero frequency @xcite , called type i excitability .",
    "this can be modeled by a saddle - node bifurcation on a limit cycle or saddle - node infinite period bifurcation ( sniper ) @xcite .",
    "it is not clear which type of excitability is the basis of sd .",
    "however , experiments with retinal spreading depression indicate excitability of type  ii behavior @xcite . the extracellular potassium concentration ( @xmath121_e$ ] )",
    "was increased stepwise . above a usually well preserved ceiling level of @xmath121_e=10\\mbox{mm}$ ] @xcite a rather spontaneous onset of oscillations with finite period was observed . due to the presence of noise and a rather large step width of @xmath122_e=2\\mbox{mm}$ ] , a definite conclusion is not yet possible .",
    "however , we assume that our results hold in principle also for excitable media in which each local element is of excitability type  i. the difference is manifest only close to the bifurcating state of the individual excitable element . in an excitable media , that is in a spatially extended system",
    ", excitability is defined by the distinguishing feature that the excited state breaks away from a local stimulated area due to transport , which usually involves diffusion .",
    "the bifurcating state of the individual elements seems therefore less important than the saddle - node bifurcation that leads to the emergence of traveling pulses ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pb ] , inset b ) .",
    "the fhn system is the most generic type that shows excitability of type ii , because the activator equation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : udot ] ) , has a cubic nonlinearity , which is generic for bistability @xcite .",
    "since we aim to describe generic features , let us briefly comment on the choice of the two parameters that we have fixed ( @xmath66 and @xmath75 ) . with this choice",
    ", the value of the diffusion coefficient in the main part of the remaining section of the parameter space is between @xmath123 and @xmath124 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pb ] ) .",
    "the diffusion coefficient of @xmath121_e$ ] , a substance often related to the activator or at least to the species by which sd propagates , is about @xmath125 in aqueous solution @xcite .",
    "there are two counteracting effects that can significantly change this value in cortical tissue .",
    "first , due to the porous geometrical structure and small volume fraction of the exctracellular space , which is similar to a soap phase , the apparent diffusion coefficient of @xmath121_e$ ] in brain tissue is estimated to @xmath126 @xcite .",
    "second , the possibility that @xmath121_e$ ] enters glial cells in one place and leaves elsewhere provides a form of facilitated diffusion that is estimated to be up to five times more important than diffusion in the extracellular space @xcite . in summary ,",
    "a generic model that simulates traveling pulses with a diffusion coefficient @xmath98 of reasonable order of magnitude seems to be appropriate .",
    "we propose that a failure of feedback provides a common mechanism of the emergence of spreading depolarizations in migraine and stroke .",
    "a recent study taking a complementary bottom - up approach , by describing sd in a detailed biophysical model , has concluded that the key to normal stability of cortical tissue is the effective regulation of @xmath127_e$ ] by the neuron s na - k ion pump and the glia - endothelial system @xcite .",
    "this complements our conclusions . in our generic approach ,",
    "our concern is not to identify the precise species behind activator , inhibitor , and feedback signals , but rather to describe spatial properties of their interaction and the emergence of travelling pulses . on the contrary , a detailed biophysical model of properties of a single neuron and its surrounding extracellular compartments",
    "can only infer statements about the local excitable state . whether a local breakdown of ion and transmitter homeostasis recruits further tissue into the excitable state or remains restricted to the initial focus",
    "is the clinically important question .",
    "this can only be answered in an extended system with sufficient spatial resolution , where a pulse propagation boundary can be defined ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pb ] ) .",
    "the existence of the propagation boundary has consequences for therapeutic approaches that aim at an effective reduction of excitability to hold the tissue below the bifurcating state and with that limit the tissue at risk @xcite .",
