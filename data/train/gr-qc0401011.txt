    "there have been many studies of the well - posedness and decay of scalar fields in a given space - time whose metric satisfies the einstein equations of general relativity , both as a precursor to the study of the stability of that metric , and as a means of probing various censorship conjectures .",
    "although our main goal in this paper is to obtain estimates for scalar fields , we need to address the issue of well - posedness as well .",
    "this question arises in studying the phenomenon of singularities in general relativity .",
    "the classical notion of a singularity of space - time is that of geodesic incompleteness .",
    "the weak cosmic censorship conjecture states that generically , singularities of spacetime must be hidden inside black holes , instead of being `` naked '' , i.e. visible to distant observers .",
    "the strong form of this conjecture posits that generically , spacetimes must be globally hyperbolic , i.e. possess a complete spacelike hypersurface such that every causal curve in the manifold intersects it at exactly one point .",
    "global hyperbolicity ensures that the spacetime has deterministic dynamics , since there is a cauchy surface whose domain of dependence is the entire spacetime . in the case where the space - time is not globally hyperbolic , which can happen for example if the metric is singular , @xmath2 , so that any point in the manifold where the metric fails to be @xmath3 needs to be removed , which can easily result in the loss of global hyperbolicity @xcite .",
    "we note however , that the singularities of metrics considered in this paper are in fact much stronger , and the curve - integrability conditions of @xcite do not hold for these examples . ] on a time - like curve , well - posedness of the cauchy problem for the scalar wave equation has been suggested @xcite as a substitute for geodesic completeness in determining how singular the spacetime actually is , and perhaps to see if quantum effects have any chance of regularizing the dynamics and restoring predictability @xcite .",
    "this is particularly relevant if censorship conjectures somehow fail to be true and naked singularities turn out to be more abundant than otherwise allowed by them .",
    "let us now recall the set - up from @xcite : let @xmath4 be a static , stably causal space - time , i.e. , one that admits a hypersurface - orthogonal killing vector field @xmath5 whose orbits are complete and everywhere timelike .",
    "a massless scalar field on @xmath6 satisfies the equation @xmath7 suppose we specify initial data for @xmath8 on a hypersurface @xmath9 that is everywhere orthogonal to @xmath5 . if @xmath6 is not globally hyperbolic , @xmath9 will not be a cauchy surface and data on @xmath9 will determine @xmath8 only on the domain of dependence @xmath10 .",
    "the aim of @xcite was to define a physically sensible recipe for determining @xmath8 everywhere in @xmath6 . to this end ,",
    "one rewrites ( [ eq : ur ] ) in the form @xmath11 here @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the killing parameter , and @xmath14 is the covariant derivative of the riemannian metric induced on @xmath9 .",
    "one then views @xmath15 as an operator on the hilbert space @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the induced volume form of @xmath9 .",
    "the point of this definition is that with respect to the inner product of @xmath18 , @xmath19 will now be symmetric and positive , although not yet self - adjoint since the initial domain of @xmath19 would have to consist of sufficiently smooth functions . if we take this initial domain to be @xmath20 ( smooth functions of compact support on @xmath9 ) then @xmath19 is also densely defined , and the equation we want to solve is @xmath21 it is then a classical result @xcite , that the above problem is well - posed , provided one replaces @xmath19 in this equation with ( one of ) its self - adjoint extension(s ) @xmath22 .",
    "such self - adjoint extensions are guaranteed to exist for real , symmetric operators @xcite .",
    "the extension may not be unique though , which would imply that there is still an ambiguity about the dynamics .",
    "this may be interpreted as having to specify boundary conditions for the scalar field `` on the singularity '' .",
    "one finds that there are three proposals for removing the ambiguity and restoring determinism to the dynamics of scalar fields :    * ( 1 ) * one can of course restrict attention only to the cases where the self - adjoint extension is unique ( the so - called essentially self - adjoint case ) , and declare that spacetimes where the operator @xmath19 is not essentially self - adjoint are `` quantum - mechanically singular '' @xcite ( meaning the singularity remains even if quantum particle dynamics , i.e waves , are considered in place of classical particle dynamics , i.e. geodesics ) . in this approach ,",
    "the naked singularities present at the center in both the negative mass schwarzschild ( @xmath23 ) and the super - extremal reissner - nordstrm ( @xmath24 ) spacetimes are quantum - mechanically singular , and nothing more can be said about the evolution of scalar fields on these backgrounds .    *",
    "( 2 ) * another possibility is to characterize the singularity that leads to non - unique self - adjoint extensions for @xmath19 as having a @xmath25 `` hair , '' @xcite where @xmath26 is the common value of the two deficiency indices @xmath27 of @xmath19 .",
    "this is because on the one hand there is a one - to - one correspondence between the self - adjoint extensions of @xmath19 and unitary maps from @xmath28 onto @xmath29 @xcite , and on the other hand , as shown in @xcite , any `` reasonable '' way of defining the dynamics on the whole spacetime , would necessarily have to arise from _ some _ self - adjoint extension of @xmath19 .",
    "we will show that the naked singularity of the super - extremal reissner - nordstrm solution is in this sense , quite hairy ( see remark  [ rem : hair ] ) .    *",
    "( 3 ) * a third approach is to distinguish one self - adjoint extension from among all the possible ones , as being somehow more `` natural '' or `` physical '' .",
    "it was suggested in @xcite that the friedrichs extension of @xmath19 , i.e. the one coming from extending the corresponding quadratic form , is such a natural choice .",
    "we note that the friedrichs extension of @xmath19 always exists , and is unique by construction - based extension ( which is equivalent to the friedrichs extension ) of this operator in the case of superextremal reissner - nordstrm , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* a.2 ) , is due to the authors error in not realizing the sobolev space @xmath30 as the closure of @xmath31 functions under the corresponding norm ( see section 3 ) . ] .",
    "moreover , as was shown in @xcite , the friedrichs extension is the only self - adjoint extension of @xmath19 under which the resulting dynamics of ( [ eq : apsi ] ) agrees with that of the corresponding first - order ( hamiltonian ) formulation , @xmath32 with @xmath33 obtained via the ( unique ) skew - adjoint extension of the corresponding operator @xmath34 .",
    "in this paper we will take the third approach , and work with the friedrichs extension of @xmath19 .",
    "this is mainly because finiteness of the @xmath30 norm is used several times in the course of the proof of our estimates , and among the extensions of @xmath19 , the friedrichs extension is the only one whose domain is contained in @xmath30 .",
    "it may be that some of our estimates hold for the other extensions of @xmath19 as well , but our proof does not extend to those cases .      the next natural question to consider for scalar waves after well - posedness is obtaining estimates for them .",
    "this is relevant among other things to the question of stability of the metric as a solution of the field equations , since expanding the perturbation functions in tensor harmonics yields a sequence of scalar wave equations @xcite , and having good estimates for each one of them seems necessary  although not sufficient  for proving linear stability of the metric under a small perturbation of its data .",
    "moreover , the question of stability has an obvious connection to cosmic censorship if the solution to be perturbed happens to have a naked singularity .",
    "most of the results obtained so far in the direction of estimates concern either boundedness of the field @xcite or its dispersion , i.e. the decay rate , with respect to the foliation parameter , of the supremum of the field on the slices of a given time - like or null foliation of a portion of the space - time @xcite . in this paper",
    "we take a different approach to this problem , by obtaining estimates that bound the _",
    "global _ space - time @xmath1-norm ( and weighted-@xmath0 norm ) of the field , in terms of appropriate norms of its data on a given cauchy hypersurface ( see @xcite for a similar approach ) .",
    "such strichartz ( resp .",
    "morawetz ) estimates , as they are known in the literature , are a staple of the modern theory of partial differential equations , and have proved very useful in the analysis of nonlinear evolution problems .",
    "we will be looking at the simplest non - trivial situation possible , namely , a spherically symmetric scalar field on a given spherically symmetric and static background space - time .",
    "furthermore , the background here is allowed to have a naked singularity , the main example we have in mind being the super - extremal ( naked ) reissner - nordstrm solution of the einstein - maxwell system .",
    "our main result is    [ thm : intro ] let @xmath4 be the reissner - nordstrm space - time manifold , with mass @xmath35 and charge @xmath36 , such that @xmath37 and let @xmath8 be a massless , chargeless , spherically symmetric , scalar field on @xmath6",
    ". then there exists a constant @xmath38 ( which may depend on @xmath36 and @xmath35 ) such that @xmath39 where @xmath40 denotes the area - radius coordinate on @xmath6 , defined in section  2 and @xmath41 is the conserved @xmath42-energy of the field , defined in section  [ sec : energy ] .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in section 2 we introduce the family of static spherically - symmetric lorentzian manifolds , define a global system of coordinates on them , and write down the evolution equation satisfied by a scalar field on such a manifold . in section 3",
    "we introduce the notion of self - adjoint extension that is necessary to make that evolution problem well - posed , and define the function spaces that are going to be used . in section 4 we state the various conditions that need to be satisfied by the metric coefficients of a manifold in the family we are considering , such that a scalar field on it will satisfy the estimate ( [ est : intro ] ) .",
    "this is then proved by transforming the problem to one about the flat wave equation with a potential , appealing to the result in @xcite , and transforming back to the original problem .",
    "the last section contains the proof of the fact that the metric coefficients of the super - extremal reissner - nordstrm solution satisfy the above mentioned conditions .",
    "this is accomplished by reformulating the problem in the language of real algebraic curves and appealing to the compactness result of  @xcite .",
    "consider a four - dimensional connected spherically symmetric static space - time @xmath43 .",
    "more precisely on @xmath6 we assume a time - like action of @xmath44 and a space - like action of @xmath45 commuting with it .",
    "these actions should be without fixed points , except that at most one @xmath44-orbit is allowed to be @xmath45-fixed , in which case it will be called the time axis .",
    "we restrict our attention to the cases where the @xmath45-orbits off the time axis are spheres .",
    "let @xmath46 denote the killing vector generating the @xmath44-action at @xmath47 and let @xmath48 denote the area of the @xmath45-orbit passing through the point @xmath47 .",
    "we define two @xmath49-invariant functions on @xmath6 as follows : @xmath50 the quotient space @xmath51 is a two - dimensional lorentzian manifold .",
    "we can assign coordinates @xmath52 on @xmath53 in such a way that @xmath54 the killing field is clearly just @xmath55 in these coordinates .",
    "we pull back @xmath13 and @xmath56 to @xmath57 .",
    "it is easy to see that we can assign angular coordinates @xmath58 on @xmath57 in such a way that the metric becomes @xmath59 and the action of @xmath45 is the usual action on the unit sphere .",
    "these coordinates are unique up to translations in the @xmath52 coordinates and rotations in the @xmath60 coordinates . if there is a time axis we can then arrange that @xmath61 there .",
    "we note that in these coordinates the volume form of the spacetime is @xmath62 while the induced volume form on the cauchy hypersurfaces @xmath63 is @xmath64 here @xmath65 denotes the volume form on the standard 2-sphere .",
    "we also note that there are at least two other volume forms on these hypersurfaces that are natural to consider , namely @xmath66 the significance of @xmath67 is that @xmath68-norms based on it behave as one would expect with respect to the @xmath13-foliation : for @xmath69 and all @xmath70 , @xmath71 the significance of @xmath72 will become clear in the next section .",
    "consider the action functional @xmath73 corresponding to a real massless scalar field @xmath74 .",
    "the lagrangian density is @xmath75 in the above - given coordinates @xmath76 where @xmath77 denotes the unit - spherical gradient , and @xmath78 a scalar field @xmath8 that is a stationary point of the action @xmath79 , subject to a given set of initial values @xmath80 on the cauchy hypersurface @xmath81 , satisfies the following cauchy problem @xmath82 where @xmath83 with @xmath84 denoting the laplace - beltrami operator on the unit 2-sphere .",
    "note that the operator @xmath19 is symmetric and positive definite with respect to the inner product given by the volume form @xmath72 , i.e. for @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 with equality only if @xmath88 .",
    "as explained in section  [ sec : intro ] , the evolution problem ( [ eq : psi ] ) is only meaningful if the operator @xmath19 there is replaced by ( one of ) its self - adjoint extension(s ) @xmath22 . in the event that the self - adjoint extension is not unique , the one we choose to pick is the friedrichs extension @xmath89 , obtained by extending the quadratic form naturally associated with the operator @xmath19 , namely @xmath90    let @xmath91 be the energy tensor of the field , defined as @xmath92 in particular , in the above given coordinates latexmath:[\\[t_{00 } = { \\frac{1}{2}}\\psi_t^2 + { \\frac{1}{2}}\\psi_r^2 + \\frac{\\alpha^2}{2\\rho^2 }    time - like killing vector field for @xmath6 .",
    "then the one - form @xmath94 defined by @xmath95 is divergence - free , i.e. @xmath96 and thus @xmath97 is a conserved current . in particular , let @xmath98 , then @xmath99 and @xmath100 , so that the only nonzero component of @xmath97 is @xmath101 , and the conserved quantity is the _ energy _ @xmath102:=\\int_{\\sigma_{t } } \\rho^2 t_{00}\\ dr d\\omega =   \\int_{\\sigma_{t } } t_{00}\\   d\\sigma''.\\ ] ] thus using the @xmath72 volume form , @xmath103 is identified with the _ energy density _ of the field",
    ".    it therefore makes sense to also use @xmath72 to define sobolev spaces on the @xmath104 s : let @xmath105 denote the completion of smooth compactly supported functions on @xmath104 with respect to the norm @xmath106 in the same way , i.e. completion with respect to the norm @xmath107 the sobolev spaces @xmath108 for @xmath109 are then defined via interpolation between the above two spaces , and one uses duality to define them also for @xmath110 .",
    "we note that by these definitions , @xmath111 and moreover @xmath102 = { \\frac{1}{2}}\\left(\\| \\psi \\|_{{\\mathbf{h}}^1(\\sigma_t)}^2 +   \\| \\psi_t \\|_{{\\mathbf{h}}^0(\\sigma_t)}^2\\right).\\ ] ] more generally , for @xmath112 we can define the @xmath113-energies @xmath114 : = { \\frac{1}{2}}\\left ( \\|\\psi\\|_{{\\mathbf{h}}^s(\\sigma_t)}^2 +   \\| \\psi_t \\|_{{\\mathbf{h}}^{s-1}(\\sigma_t)}^2 \\right),\\ ] ] and it is not hard to see that they are all conserved under the flow ( [ eq : psifri ] ) : @xmath115 = 0.\\ ] ]",
    "it is clear that if we can view ( [ eq : psi ] ) as an evolution in minkowski space , we may then be able to apply known theorems in order to get the estimates we want .",
    "this is of course only possible if the manifold @xmath6 has at least the same topology as @xmath116 ( or @xmath116 minus a line , in order to allow a singular time axis ) . we will be making this assumption from now on , and denote the coordinates on @xmath116 by the same letters as those on @xmath6 , namely @xmath117 , and a @xmath13-slice in @xmath116 is still denoted by @xmath104",
    "let us define @xmath118 by @xmath119 note that @xmath120    we can easily check that for @xmath121 we can perform an integration by parts to obtain @xmath122 ^ 2 u^2 +   \\frac{\\rho}{r}\\partial_r(\\frac{r}{\\rho})\\partial_r ( u^2 ) \\right ] r^2 dr\\,d\\omega\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\int_{\\sigma_t } \\left [ u_r^2 + \\frac{\\alpha^2}{\\rho^2 } |{\\displaystyle{\\not\\!\\nabla}}u|^2 +   v(r ) u^2 \\right ] r^2 dr d\\omega = :   q_b(u),\\label{equiq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the  potential \" @xmath123 is defined by @xmath124 let @xmath125 denote the operator whose associated quadratic form is @xmath126 defined above , i.e. @xmath127 we then have that @xmath128 note that the first term in the definition of @xmath125 coincides with the radial flat laplacian .",
    "in particular , if @xmath8 satisfying ( [ eq : psi ] ) is spherically symmetric , i.e. @xmath129 , then @xmath130 can be viewed as a _",
    "solution of the flat wave equation with a potential @xmath131 with @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",

    "we postpone the rest of the proof of this proposition until the end of the section , and instead show first how this implies the desired result about @xmath123 , i.e. that it satisfies condition ( iii ) of theorem  [ thm : main ] .",
    "_ proof : _ we have for @xmath246 @xmath253 and @xmath254.\\ ] ] consider the algebraic curve @xmath255 .",
    "it has a branch @xmath203 .",
    "the other two branches can be transformed into a hyperbola by changing variables to @xmath256 let @xmath257 denote the piece of this hyperbola that lies in the first quadrant of the @xmath258 plane , i.e. @xmath259 with @xmath260 likewise , let @xmath261 denote the part of the transcendental curve @xmath262 in the same quadrant : @xmath263 where @xmath264 has the following expansion @xmath265 recall that we have already shown by ( [ p0neg ] ) that the function @xmath252 can not have a stationary point of inflection",
    ". therefore on each branch of the hyperbola @xmath266 the second derivative @xmath267 must be of one sign .",
    "thus one branch must correspond to minima and the other to maxima of @xmath252 .",
    "it is not hard to see that @xmath268 , the lower branch of the hyperbola @xmath257 , is well separated from @xmath269 : let @xmath270 be the rectangle @xmath271\\times[0,6/37]$ ] in the @xmath258 plane .",
    "then      _ proof : _ the @xmath273-intercept of @xmath268 is at @xmath274 .",
    "the tangent line to @xmath268 at the point @xmath275 is @xmath276 .",
    "since @xmath268 is concave down , it lies below this tangent , and the @xmath277-intercept of the tangent line is at @xmath278 which shows the first part of the claim .",
    "consider next the ode satisfied by the curve @xmath279 , i.e. @xmath280 . for @xmath281 we have @xmath282 which upon integration yields @xmath283 and thus @xmath284 , while if @xmath285 then @xmath286 and thus , using the bound ( [ xibnd ] ) at @xmath287 , @xmath288 and thus @xmath289",
    ". thus along @xmath261 we have @xmath290 , which proves the second part of the claim .",
    "let @xmath291 denote the upper branch of the hyperbola @xmath257 .",
    "it intersects @xmath292 at @xmath293 .",
    "this point corresponds to the origin of the @xmath294 plane where we know that @xmath224 has a local maximum .",
    "we have thus shown in the above claim that @xmath295 can not have any local minima . moreover",
    ", we can compute the tangent lines to the two curves at @xmath296 and we obtain that @xmath297 thus @xmath291 is below @xmath292 near @xmath298 .",
    "it is easy to see that this is also the case near the @xmath277 axis ( which corresponds to the infinity of the @xmath294 plane ) .",
    "thus if @xmath292 were to intersect @xmath291 it would have to do so at least twice . since a continuous function can not have two consecutive local maxima without a minimum in between this",
    "is not possible and the curves @xmath291 and @xmath292 have no other common point in ( the first quadrant of ) the @xmath258 plane .",
    "this proves the lemma .          _",
    "proof : _ let @xmath301 note that @xmath302 is closed . from ( [ taylor2 ] )",
    "we see that there is an @xmath303 such that there @xmath304 in the region @xmath305 , @xmath306 . similarly , from ( [ taylor5 ] ) we see that there is a @xmath307 such that @xmath304 in the region @xmath308 , @xmath306 .",
    "@xmath302 is therefore compact , since it is a closed subset of @xmath309\\times[0,{\\frac{1}{2}}]$ ] .    if @xmath302 is nonempty",
    ", then there exists a point @xmath310 in @xmath302 with smallest @xmath195 , i.e. @xmath311 for all @xmath312 .",
    "thus @xmath313 and @xmath314 .",
    "by the previous lemma , @xmath315 .",
    "suppose that @xmath316 .",
    "then by the implicit function theorem , we can solve @xmath317 near @xmath310 , to get the curve @xmath318 .",
    "now for @xmath319 ,",
    "@xmath320 so we have @xmath321 .",
    "thus by continuity , @xmath322 , which leads to a contradiction .",
    "thus we must have @xmath323 .",
    "but this is ruled out by proposition  [ prop : nospi ]",
    ". therefore @xmath302 must be empty .",
    "this proves the statement of proposition  [ prop : jz ] .",
    "we conclude with the remainder of the proof of proposition  [ prop : nospi ] .",
    "first we need some definitions : for @xmath324 a polynomial in two variables with real coefficients , let @xmath153 be the curve @xmath325 considered as a subset of @xmath326 in the usual topology .",
    "newton polygon _ of @xmath327 is defined to be the convex hull of the set @xmath328 if @xmath329 is an ( oriented ) edge of the newton polygon with endpoints @xmath330 and @xmath331 , then the numbers @xmath332 , @xmath333 and @xmath334 are defined by @xmath335 and the _ edge polynomial _ @xmath336 $ ] by @xmath337 an edge is called _",
    "outer _ if it maximizes some linear function @xmath338 on the newton polygon , where at least one of @xmath339 or @xmath340 is positive .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath327 does not satisfy the criteria in this theorem , since some of the outer edge polynomials are of odd degree . to remedy this",
    ", we take a simple projective transformation of the plane and consider its composition with @xmath327 : let @xmath341 we need to show that @xmath342 has no zeros in the region @xmath343 .",
    "the newton polygon of @xmath342 is the image of the newton polygon of @xmath327 under the linear map @xmath344 .",
    "it is shown in figure  [ fig : nq ] .",
    "there are two outer edges , with corresponding edge polynomials @xmath345 @xmath346 is clearly never zero , and the fact that @xmath347 has no real zeros is easily checked by sturm s criterion . by the above theorem , the zeroes of @xmath342 are a compact set .",
    "if @xmath348 is maximal for this set then @xmath349 is zero",
    ". the resultant of @xmath342 and @xmath349 with respect to @xmath350 must then be zero as well .",
    "this resultant is @xmath351 where @xmath352    and @xmath353 @xmath354 has no real zeros at all , while all the zeros of @xmath160 are contained in @xmath355 .",
    "both of these facts are established by sturm s criterion .",
    "it follows that the maximal value of @xmath348 is less that @xmath356 , and this concludes the proof of proposition  [ prop : nospi ] .",
