    "the top quark is the heaviest known elementary particle , and it plays a fundamental role in testing the standard model ( sm ) and the extensions of the sm .",
    "its production and decay channels are important probes of new physics , and because of its large coupling to the higgs , the top quark production processes provide a sensitive probe of electroweak symmetry breaking . the total cross - section for the top quark pair production has been calculated up to nnlo within the @xmath15-scheme in refs .",
    "the sm estimates , especially those obtained by using the principle of maximum conformality ( pmc ) @xcite , agree well with the experimental result which has been measured with a precision @xmath16 at the tevatron  @xcite and @xmath17 at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "the top quark forward - backward asymmetry which originates from charge asymmetry physics  @xcite has also been studied at the tevatron and lhc .",
    "two options for the asymmetry have been used for experimental analysis ; i.e. the @xmath0-rest frame asymmetry @xmath18 and the @xmath19-laboratory frame asymmetry @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the top quark rapidity in the @xmath0-rest frame and @xmath22 is the top quark rapidity in the @xmath19-laboratory frame ( or the @xmath19 center - of - mass frame ) .",
    "the cdf and d0 collaborations have found comparable values in the @xmath0-rest frame : @xmath23  @xcite and @xmath24  @xcite , where the uncertainties are derived from a combination of statistical and systematic errors .",
    "the asymmetry in the @xmath19-laboratory frame measured by cdf is @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "the cdf collaboration has also measured the dependence of @xmath26 with respect to the @xmath0-invariant mass @xmath27 : the asymmetry increases with @xmath27 , and @xmath28  @xcite .",
    "these measured top quark forward - backward asymmetries are much larger than the usual sm estimates .",
    "for example , the nlo qcd contributions to the asymmetric @xmath0-production using conventional scale setting yield @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , which are about @xmath31-deviation from the above measurements .",
    "for the case of @xmath32 , using the mcfm program  @xcite , one obtains @xmath33 which is about @xmath34-deviation from the data .",
    "these discrepancies have aroused great interest because of the possibility for probing new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "a recent reevaluation of the electroweak correction raises the qcd asymmetries by at most @xmath35 : i.e. @xmath36  @xcite and @xmath37  @xcite .",
    "it has been argued that the missing higher - order corrections can not be the reason for the significant discrepancy  @xcite .",
    "in fact , only a several percent increment has been observed in ref.@xcite using a next - to - next - to - leading - logarithmic ( nnll ) calculation .",
    "it is for this reason that many new physics models beyond the sm have been suggested .",
    "since the sm estimate on the total cross - section agrees well with the experimental data , it is hard to understand the large deviation of the asymmetry . before introducing any new physics ,",
    "it is best to have a more precise estimation within the sm .",
    "it should be noted that all the present sm estimations are based on the conventional scale setting , where the renormalization scale @xmath38 is set to be the typical momentum transfer @xmath39 of the process ; i.e. @xmath40 .",
    "one then estimates the scale - uncertainty by varying @xmath41 $ ] , which will lead to a @xmath42 scale uncertainty to the asymmetry .",
    "usually , it is argued that this scale uncertainty can be suppressed by including higher - order corrections in an order - by - order manner .",
    "the conventional scale setting procedure is clearly problematic since the resulting fixed - order pqcd prediction will depend on the choice of renormalization scheme .",
    "in fact , it gives the wrong result when applied to qed processes .",
    "it should be recalled that there is no ambiguity in setting the renormalization scale in qed . in the standard gell - mann - low scheme for qed ,",
    "the renormalization scale is the virtuality of the virtual photon  @xcite .",
    "for example , the renormalization scale for the electron - muon elastic scattering through one - photon exchange can be set as the virtuality of the exchanged photon , i.e. @xmath43 . but it is wrong to use @xmath39 directly as the scale for any other renormalization scheme . some displacement must be included in order to ensure scheme - independence .",
    "for example , under the @xmath44 scheme we have @xmath45  @xcite .",
    "this result shows that the effective scale of the @xmath15 scheme should generally be about half of the true momentum transfer occurring in the interaction .",
    "the invariance under choice of renormalization scheme is a consequence of the transitivity property of the renormalization group  @xcite .",
    "of course , the question is more complicated in qcd due to its non - abelian nature .",
    "recently , it has been suggested that one can systematically fix the renormalization scale at any fixed order by using the pmc  @xcite .",
    "the pmc provides the principle underlying the brodsky - lepage - mackenzie method  @xcite , and they are consistent with each other through the pmc - blm correspondence principle  @xcite .",
    "the main idea is that , after proper procedures , all nonconformal @xmath46-terms in the perturbative expansion are summed into the running coupling so that the remaining terms in the perturbative series are identical to that of a conformal theory ; i.e. , the corresponding theory with @xmath47 . the underlying conformal symmetry is a useful principle for physics ; e.g. the ads / qcd theory  @xcite , the conformal general relativity model  @xcite and the canonical quantum gravity theory  @xcite .",
    "after pmc scale setting , the divergent renormalon series with @xmath48-growth does not appear in the conformal series .",
    "this is consistent with the treatment done in ref.@xcite . since renormalon terms",
    "are absent , one obtains a more convergent perturbative expansion series , and thus the full next - to - leading order ( nlo ) , or even the leading - order ( lo ) calculation , is often enough to achieve the required accuracy .",
    "the pmc scale @xmath49 is unambiguous at any finite order .",
    "we emphasize that the pmc is consistent with the renormalization group property that a physical result is independent of the renormalization scheme and the choice of the initial renormalization scale @xmath2 .",
    "any residual dependence on @xmath2 for a finite - order calculation is highly suppressed since the unknown higher - order @xmath46-terms will be absorbed into the pmc scales higher - order perturbative terms .",
    "as an application , we have previously applied the pmc procedure to obtain nnlo predictions for the @xmath0-pair hadroproduction cross - section at the tevatron and lhc colliders  @xcite .",
    "it is found that there is almost no dependence on the choice of initial renormalization scale ; i.e. the total cross - section remains almost unchanged even when taking very disparate initial scales @xmath2 equal to @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , thus greatly improving the precision of the qcd prediction . by using the pmc scales ,",
    "a larger @xmath1 is obtained in comparison to the conventional scale setting , which agrees well with the present tevatron and lhc data .",
    "it is thus interesting to see whether the use of pmc scales , especially those of the dominant asymmetric @xmath7-channel at the tevatron , can improve our understanding on the top quark forward - backward symmetry ; this is the purpose of the present paper .",
    "the remaining parts of this paper are organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we give the relevant formulae for the top quark forward - backward asymmetry .",
    "the new properties of the predictions after pmc scale setting are presented . in sec .",
    "iii , we present the numerical results and some discussions for the top quark forward - backward asymmetry at the tevatron .",
    "iv provides a summary .",
    "before discussing the top quark forward - backward asymmetry , we first review the total cross - sections for the top quark pair production at the tevatron up to nnlo .    a comparison of the production cross - sections using conventional scale setting versus pmc scale setting will give us some useful information on how the pmc scale setting can improve our understanding of the top quark pair production : the relative importance of all the production channels , especially those which provide the asymmetries ; the convergence of the perturbative series for each production channel ; etc .",
    "this information will be helpful for constructing a more precise perturbative expansion for calculating the top quark forward - backward asymmetry .",

    "has been recently presented by using the conventional scale setting which also shows a very small perturbative uncertainty between the nnlo and nnll calculation , i.e. @xmath54  @xcite .",
    "] and the explicit calculation technology for pmc scale setting can be found in ref.@xcite , so we will not present them here .",
    "numerical results for the top quark pair production at the tevatron with @xmath19-collision energy @xmath50 tev are presented in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "the coulomb - type corrections will lead to sizable contributions in the threshold region  @xcite which are enhanced by factors of @xmath55 .",
    "thus the terms which are proportional to @xmath56 or @xmath57 ( @xmath58 is the top quark velocity in the partonic center - of - mass frame ; @xmath59 is the subprocess center - of - mass energy squared ) at the nlo or nnlo level should be treated separately  @xcite . for this purpose ,",
    "the results listed in the _ total_-column is not a simple summation of the corresponding lo , nlo and nnlo results ; the results are obtained by using the sommerfeld rescattering formula to treat the coulomb part . in doing the numerical calculation , we set @xmath60 gev  @xcite and the factorization scale @xmath61 .",
    "we set @xmath62 for conventional scale setting , and take the initial renormalization scale @xmath63 to initialize pmc scale setting . for the pdfs , we adopt msrt 2004-qed parton distributions  @xcite to be consistent with the choice of ref.@xcite .    by comparing with the total cross - sections derived from the pmc scale setting and the conventional scale setting listed in table [ tab1 ] , we observe the following points :    * at the tevatron , the top quark pair cross - section is dominated by the @xmath7-channel which provides @xmath64 contribution to the total cross - section .",
    "the @xmath7-channel is asymmetric at the nlo level , so it will lead to sizable top quark forward - backward asymmetry at the tevatron .",
    "in contrast , one finds that the dominant channel at the lhc is the symmetric @xmath65-channel , c.f .",
    "ref.@xcite , so the top quark forward - backward asymmetry from other channels will be greatly diluted at the lhc ; this asymmetry becomes small which agrees with the cms and atlas measurements  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , at present , we will concentrate on the top quark forward - backward asymmetry at the tevatron .",
    "+    +    * at the lowest order , the two channels @xmath66 and @xmath67 do not discriminate the final top quark and top - antiquark , so their differential distributions are symmetric for the hadronic production process . at the nlo level , either the virtual or real gluon emission will cause sizable differences between the differential top quark and top - antiquark production , thus leading to an observable top quark forward - backward asymmetry . at the tevatron ,",
    "the asymmetric channels are @xmath7- , @xmath68- and @xmath69- channels accordingly .",
    "table [ tab1 ] shows the total cross - sections of the @xmath68 and @xmath69 channels are quite small , less than @xmath70 of that of @xmath7-channel , so their contributions to the asymmetry can be safely neglected .",
    "figure ( [ asy1 ] ) shows the dominant feynman diagrams for the qcd charge asymmetry at the nlo level and fig.([asy2 ] ) shows the less important flavor - excitation feynman diagrams for the qcd charge asymmetry at the nlo level . *",
    "when using conventional scale setting , the nnlo cross - section for the @xmath7-channel is about @xmath71 of its nlo cross - section ; i.e. @xmath72 . thus in order to derive a consistent asymmetry up to nnlo , one must consider the asymmetric contribution from the nnlo @xmath7-channel , which may be sizable .",
    "in contrast , a much more convergent pqcd series expansion is obtained after pmc scale setting , since all non - conformal @xmath46-terms in the perturbative expansion are summed into the running coupling .",
    "for example for the asymmetric @xmath7-channel , the value of @xmath73 is lowered to be only @xmath74 .",
    "this shows that after pmc scale setting , the change to the asymmetry from the nnlo is greatly suppressed . *",

    "we have shown that after pmc scale setting , both the top quark forward - backward asymmetries @xmath8 and @xmath9 for @xmath0-rest frame and @xmath19-laboratory frame can be increased by @xmath158 ; i.e. @xmath183 moreover , the top quark asymmetry with certain kinematical cut , such as @xmath184 , can be raised by about @xmath168 times ; i.e. @xmath185 this shows that , after pmc scale setting , the top quark forward - backward asymmetries are close to the cdf and d0 measurements within only @xmath186-deviation .",
    "the discrepancies between the sm estimate and the present cdf and d0 data are greatly reduced .",
    "this greatly suppresses the parameter space for new physics .",
    "it is clear that the previous large discrepancy between the sm estimation and the cdf and d0 data for the top quark forward - backward asymmetry is caused by the improper setting of the renormalization scale .",
    "the pmc provides a systematic way to obtain optimal renormalization scales for the high energy process , whose theoretical predictions are essentially free of initial renormalization scale dependence even at fixed order .",
    "as we have shown the top quark pair total cross - section and its forward - backward asymmetry are almost unaltered by taking very disparate initial renormalization scales at the nnlo level .",
