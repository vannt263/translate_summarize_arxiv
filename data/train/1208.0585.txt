    "understanding the meson mass spectrum in the region below 2 gev is one of the fundamental problems of qcd . while the quark model seems to work very well for many resonances",
    "[ see , for instance , the summary in ref .",
    "@xcite ] , some fundamental questions , such as the constituent quark content of scalar and axial - vector resonances , are still unanswered .    the quark content of the scalar mesons has been a matter of debate for many decades @xcite .",
    "the particle data group ( pdg ) @xcite suggests the existence of five @xmath2 states in the region below 1.8 gev : @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 . also the existence of a sixth state ,",
    "@xmath8 , close to , but distinct from , @xmath7 has been claimed @xcite .",
    "additionally , there are scalar resonances in the isotriplet and in the isodoublet sector as well : the @xmath9 states @xmath10 and @xmath11 are well established ; the existence of the @xmath12 state @xmath13 ( or @xmath14 ) is confirmed by some @xcite and disputed by other authors @xcite , whereas the @xmath12 scalar kaon , @xmath15 , is an established resonance .",
    "a description of all mentioned scalar states as @xmath1 states is not possible for a simple reason : the number of physical resonances is much larger than the number of resonances that can be constructed within a @xmath1 picture of mesons .",
    "explicitly , there is only one @xmath2 state that can be constructed from the ( non - strange ) @xmath16 and @xmath17 quarks ( provided they are degenerate ) . denoting this state as @xmath18",
    "we obtain @xmath19",
    ". an additional @xmath2 state can be constructed , if the strange quark is considered as well : the pure strange state @xmath20 .",
    "since @xmath18 and @xmath21 have the same @xmath22 quantum numbers , we expect the physical spectrum to consist of mixed , rather than pure , states of @xmath23 and @xmath21 ; however , such mixing will , of course , produce exactly two new states .",
    "these states will correspond to at most two of the mentioned five ( six ) @xmath24 states , and the natural question is then : _ which two _ ?",
    "similarly , in both the @xmath9 and @xmath12 sectors one can construct only one quark - antiquark resonance .",
    "restricting for example to electric charge @xmath25 , one has the states @xmath26 and @xmath27 the state @xmath26 can be assigned to @xmath10 or @xmath11 , and @xmath28 to @xmath13 or @xmath29 the question is : _ which is the correct assignment ? _    an answer to these questions is inevitably complicated for several reasons .",
    "firstly , as already indicated , states with the same @xmath22 quantum numbers are expected to mix  this needs to be considered in particular in the scalar sector due to the large number of physical resonances .",
    "secondly , basic features ( pole mass and decay width ) of some scalar mesons [ e.g.  @xmath3 ] are notoriously difficult to determine experimentally , which makes it non - trivial to determine the structure of these states [ see , e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite for an example regarding the @xmath3 resonance and ref .",
    "@xcite for an example regarding @xmath5 ] .",
    "the question of how to correctly determine the quark structure of the mesons is not only restricted to the scalar sector .",
    "more recently , also the nature of the axial - vector mesons , most notably @xmath32 , but also that of the isoscalar states @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and the kaonic state @xmath35 [ or @xmath36 , see the discussion in ref .  @xcite and refs .  therein ] have been investigated .",
    "should one interpret the isotriplet resonance @xmath32 as a quark - antiquark state , as the quark model suggests ( e.g.  @xmath37 ) , or is this state a broad @xmath38 molecular state ?",
    "understanding these issues is not only crucial for hadron vacuum spectroscopy but is also important at nonzero temperatures and densities , because the correct identification of the chiral partner of the pion and of the @xmath39 meson is necessary for a proper description of the in - medium properties of hadrons @xcite .",
    "in fact , if the @xmath32 is ( predominantly ) a quark - antiquark state , it is the chiral partner of the @xmath39 meson , with which it becomes degenerate at large @xmath40 and @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "the chiral partner of the pion is the scalar - isoscalar state @xmath42 which has been identified with the lightest scalar state @xmath3 in many works . however , as various theoretical results for the vacuum have shown , and as we shall present in detail in this work , this assignment is not correct : it turns out that @xmath5 emerges as the chiral partner of the pion .",
    "last but not least , the question of the origin of hadron masses is important .",
    "one aims to understand to which extent the quark condensate , @xmath43 , and the gluon condensate , @xmath44 , generate the hadron masses . to give an example , which condensate is predominantly responsible for the mass of the @xmath39 meson ? and related to this , how will the mass of the @xmath39 ( and that of other resonances ) change in the medium ?",
    "the answers to all these fundamental questions are in principle contained in the qcd lagrangian .",
    "unfortunately , qcd can not be solved by analytic means from first principles in the low - energy domain .",
    "for this reason , effective theories have been developed which share some of the underlying symmetries of qcd .",
    "the qcd lagrangian exhibits , in addition to the local @xmath45 color symmetry and the discrete @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath40 symmetries , a global chiral @xmath48 symmetry which is broken in several ways : spontaneously [ due to the chiral condensate @xmath49  @xcite ] , explicitly ( due to non - vanishing quark masses ) , as well as at the quantum level [ the @xmath50 anomaly @xcite ] .    in the framework of effective theories the chiral symmetry of qcd can be realized along two lines : linearly @xcite and non - linearly @xcite . in the former case one",
    "obtains the so - called linear sigma model : both scalar and pseudoscalar degrees of freedom are present and vectors as well as axial - vectors can be included into the model in a straightforward manner @xcite .",
    "note that an important advantage of linear sigma models is the possibility to investigate the state of matter at large values of temperature and chemical potential [ e.g.  in the region of the chiral transition , i.e. , where chiral symmetry is restored @xcite ] .",
    "every linear sigma model contains so - called chiral partners  states that mix with each other under axial transformations  that become degenerate when chiral symmetry is restored . in the non - linear realization ( i.e. , the non - linear sigma models ) , the scalar and the ( axial-)vector states are integrated out and the pseudoscalar states are the only degrees of the freedom : one obtains the lagrangian of chiral perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "if the vector mesons are not integrated out , one is left with chiral perturbation theory with vector mesons , see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite and refs .  therein .    in this paper",
    ", we present a linear sigma model containing scalar , pseudoscalar , vector , and axial - vector mesons with both non - strange and strange quantum numbers .",
    "although this project represents a straightforward implementation of the principles of the linear realization of chiral symmetry as already outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite , this is  to our knowledge  the first time that all these degrees of freedom are considered within a single linear chiral framework . in view of the large number of the fields involved , our model shall be referred to as extended linear sigma model , or elsm .",
    "moreover , we also exploit a ",
    "classical  symmetry of the qcd lagrangian in the chiral limit : the dilatation symmetry .",
    "this symmetry is broken by quantum effects ( trace anomaly ) and generates , through dimensional transmutation , the qcd low - energy scale @xmath51 . we describe this phenomenon by including a dilaton field in our model .",
    "the associated potential for the dilaton field encodes the trace anomaly by an explicit breaking of dilatation symmetry .",
    "we assume that , except for terms associated with the @xmath52 anomaly and nonzero quark masses , all other interactions are dilatation invariant .",
    "assuming in addition analyticity in the fields ( i.e. , absence of divergences in the lagrangian in the limit of vanishing fields ) , the number of terms appearing in the lagrangian is finite .",
    "the fluctuations of the dilaton field correspond to the glueball degree of freedom . in this work ,",
    "we neglect the coupling of the glueball with the other mesonic degrees of freedom .",
    "formally , this can be justified by taking the large-@xmath53 limit . in a future work",
    ", we also plan to study the coupling of the glueball to mesons in our framework , similar to the @xmath54 study of ref .",
    "@xcite .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , we have already presented a linear sigma model with vector and axial - vector mesons for two flavors . comparing our model with experimental data for meson vacuum phenomenology led us to conclude that the scalar @xmath1 states are located in the energy region above 1 gev in the hadron mass spectrum .",
    "explicitly , we concluded that the resonances @xmath5 and @xmath11 are strongly favoured to be scalar quarkonia .",
    "the present work is more general : we now consider three flavors both in the ( pseudo)scalar and ( axial-)vector channels in order to ascertain whether the conclusion of ref .",
    "@xcite is still valid once strange mesons are considered .",
    "we emphasize that , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , all fields entering our model describe pure quark - antiquark states .",
    "the reason is that masses and decay widths of our theoretical states scale as @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively , where @xmath57 is the number of colors ; thus all decay widths vanish in the large-@xmath57 limit .",
    "note that the inclusion of strange mesons provides us with a large number of very precise data [ in general , decisively more precise than in the case of non - strange mesons @xcite ] . as a consequence ,",
    "our model parameters are much more constrained than in ref .",
    "preliminary results of this work have already been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in order to ( _ i _ ) test the performance of a linear sigma model in describing the overall phenomenology of ( pseudo)scalar and ( axial-)vector mesons and ( _ ii _ ) ascertain which scalar states are predominantly quarkonia , we perform a global fit in which 21 experimentally known quantities ( decay constants , masses , and decay widths as well as amplitudes ) are included .",
    "the situation in the scalar - isoscalar sector is extremely uncertain because five ( six ) resonances , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 [ and , possibly in the future , @xmath8 ] are listed in the pdg .",
    "in addition , the @xmath3 and @xmath5 decay widths and branching ratios are poorly known and @xmath4 suffers from a distortion by the @xmath59 threshold .",
    "moreover , a scalar glueball state with a bare mass of about @xmath60 gev as predicted by lattice qcd @xcite can sizably affect the masses and the branching ratios of the scalar states above 1 gev , that is @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 @xcite . in view of all these reasons , we do _ not _ include the scalar - isoscalar states into the fit .",
    "we note that , although the coupling of the glueball state to the other mesons is not considered in this paper , it does not affect our global fit .",
    "we do , however , include the isotriplet and isodoublet quark - antiquark scalar states and we test all four combinations @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 .",
    "quite remarkably , the outcome of the fit is univocal : only the pair @xmath61 yields a good fit , while the other combinations do not .",
    "we thus conclude that the @xmath9 and @xmath12 quark - antiquark scalar resonances lie above 1 gev .",
    "in fact , the quality of our fit is surprisingly good .",
    "we describe _ all _ experimental quantities with an average error of 5% , and most of them even to much better precision .",
    "we perceive this to be a remarkable achievement within an ( in principle , quite simple ) effective model for the strong interaction .",
    "we then study the two scalar - isoscalar quark - antiquark states in our model : a consequence of our fit is their mass in the large-@xmath57 limit .",
    "these masses turn out to be about @xmath65 gev and @xmath66 gev , respectively . varying large-@xmath57 suppressed parameters which can not be determined by our fit",
    ", one can also study their decays : the non - strange quark - antiquark state is well described by @xmath5 and the heavier @xmath67 state might be @xmath68 turning to the axial - vector channel , both masses and decays are well described by assuming the axial - vector resonances @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 as ( predominantly ) quark - antiquark states .",
    "detailed calculations of all formulas used in this paper as well as further discussion are presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model ] we discuss the @xmath69 linear sigma model with vector and axial - vector mesons . in sec .",
    "[ fitprocedure ] we discuss the global fit and its consequences and in sec .  [ sec : conclusion ] we present our conclusions .",
    "we defer detailed calculations to appendices  [ app : mass ] and [ app : decay ] .",
    "our units are @xmath70 ; the metric tensor is @xmath71 .",
    "in this section we present our model : a linear sigma model with ( axial-)vector mesons and global chiral @xmath69 symmetry . to this end , we discuss some important criteria for the construction of its lagrangian.the aim of our work is to emulate the properties of the qcd lagrangian in our effective approach .",
    "this implies the necessity to consider as many symmetries of qcd as possible .",
    "the qcd lagrangian possesses various symmetries : local ( gauge ) invariance with respect to the color group @xmath72 , discrete @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath40 symmetries , global chiral symmetry @xmath73 ( which is exact in the chiral limit ) , and also the classical dilatation ( scale ) symmetry .",
    "the local color symmetry is automatically fulfilled when working with colorless hadronic degrees of freedom .",
    "the discrete and chiral symmetries impose severe constraints on the terms which are kept in the lagrangian ; still , infinitely many are allowed .",
    "indeed , in some older versions of the linear sigma model , terms with dimension larger than four were considered , see for example refs .",
    "@xcite . in these approaches",
    "chiral symmetry was promoted to a _ local symmetry _",
    ", up to the vector meson mass term which breaks this symmetry explicitly . sigma models with local chiral symmetry require the inclusion of terms of order larger than four in the fields in order to correctly describe experimental data .",
    "this procedure obviously breaks renormalizability , but this is not an issue because a hadronic theory is obviously not fundamental and is supposed to be valid only up to a mass scale of @xmath74@xmath75 gev .",
    "still , the problem of constraining the number of terms affects these effective approaches of qcd .",
    "we then turn our attention to the last of the mentioned symmetries of qcd : the dilatation symmetry .",
    "it plays a key role to justify why we retain only a _ finite _ number of terms @xcite .",
    "let us recall some of the basic features of the dilatation symmetry in the pure gauge sector of qcd : the yang - mills ( ym ) lagrangian ( qcd without quarks ) is classically invariant under dilatations , but this symmetry is broken at the quantum level .",
    "the divergence of the corresponding current is the trace of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath76 of the ym lagrangian @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the gluon field - strength tensor and @xmath79 the beta function of ym theory . at the composite level",
    ", one can parametrize this situation by introducing the dilaton field @xmath80 , which is described by the lagrangian @xcite @xmath81 the dilatation symmetry is explicitly broken by the scale @xmath82 under the logarithm .",
    "the minimum of the dilaton potential is realized for @xmath83 ; upon shifting @xmath84 a particle with mass @xmath85 emerges , which is interpreted as the scalar glueball . the numerical value has been evaluated in lattice qcd and reads @xmath86 gev @xcite . in the large-@xmath53 limit , @xmath87 ,",
    "while the @xmath88-glueball vertex @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "applying this to eq .",
    "( [ ldil ] ) , we observe that @xmath90 . in the large-@xmath53 limit ,",
    "the glueball self - interaction terms vanishes and the glueball becomes a free field .",
    "we are now ready to present our lagrangian .",
    "it follows from requiring symmetry under @xmath91 , ( global ) chiral @xcite , as well as dilatation transformations . in accordance with qcd",
    ", we take the latter two symmetries to be explicitly broken only by nonzero quark masses , and dilatation symmetry to be explicitly broken only by the dilaton potential in eq .  ( [ ldil ] ) as well as the @xmath92 anomaly .",
    "therefore , all other terms in the lagrangian must be dilatation invariant and thus carry mass dimension equal to four .",
    "this would in principle still allow for an infinite number of terms .",
    "however , assuming in addition that there are no terms with non - analytic powers of the field variables makes the number of possible terms finite .",

    "the reason for our result is the pattern of explicit symmetry breaking implemented in our model , which renders @xmath1 states with a strange quark approximately 100 mev heavier than non - strange states .",
    "however , other mechanisms , as for instance mixing of the currently present @xmath1 states with light tetraquark states , may occur that change this mass ordering @xcite : namely , in this mixing scenario a pure quarkonium and a pure tetraquark in the isovector sector mix to form the resonances @xmath11 and @xmath10 , while a similar mixing in the isodoublet sector leads to the resonances @xmath306 and @xmath385 .",
    "the fact that the mass ordering @xmath386 is realized in nature can be understood from a larger mixing angle , and therefore a larger level repulsion , in the isovector sector .",
    "a detailed study of this scenario necessitates the inclusion of a full nonet of light states , see also the discussion in the conclusions .",
    "an additional point can be raised about the ratio of the full decay widths of the @xmath11 and @xmath15 resonances . from @xmath387 symmetry arguments for @xmath1 states one expects the full decay widths of these resonances to scale as @xcite @xmath388 whereas experimental data suggest @xcite @xmath389 in ref .",
    "@xcite , this problem was also solved by introducing tetraquark fields at the level of an effective lagrangian and by studying tetraquark - quarkonium mixing in the @xmath9 and @xmath12 channels .",
    "contrarily , in our considerations so far only @xmath1 states were taken into account . thus one might expect that our fit results should be closer to the @xmath390 limit rather than to the experimental ratio .",

    ". the ratio would be @xmath399 if only ( axial-)vectors were decoupled .",
    "hence , just as in our previous publication @xcite , we emphasize again the crucial importance of the ( axial-)vector degrees of freedom for scalar - meson phenomenology .",

    "most particles in our model are rather narrow , and thus justify  at least in a first approximation  this procedure .",
    "this is also in agreement with large-@xmath57 considerations , according to which the role of the contribution of mesonic loops is suppressed .",
    "however , the axial - vector state @xmath401 and the scalar states @xmath11 and @xmath402 as well as the scalar - isoscalar state @xmath5 to be discussed in the next subsection , have a large width ( of the order of @xmath403 mev or more ) .",
    "then , the role of loops and unitarity corrections for both the masses and the decay widths needs to be discussed .",
    "concerning the mass shifts due to mesonic loops , we notice that an indirect indication that their contribution is not too large is the fact that the resonances @xmath404 and @xmath33 have a similar mass , although the former has a much larger decay width than the latter . in a theoretical study of this system",
    "one should determine the pole position of the resonance : the mass is then usually denoted as the real part of the pole . as shown recently in ref .",
    "@xcite , the value of the real part of the pole does not differ too much from the bare ( tree - level ) mass , not even for large coupling constants . concerning the influence of loops on the value of decay widths , we note that ref .",
    "@xcite has shown that the corrections are small as long as the ratio @xmath405 is small .",
    "for instance , for the case of @xmath5 , the average decay width reported by the particle data group is @xmath406 mev whereas the average resonance mass is @xmath407 mev .",
    "this implies @xmath408 .",
    "the ratio is almost as small as in the case of the @xmath39 meson where @xmath409  and it is known from chiral perturbation theory that such resonances obtain only small corrections upon unitarizations [ see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ] .",
    "we thus conclude that the role of loops should not modify the picture presented here .",
    "it should , however , be stressed that the inclusion of loops is a necessary step for the future : on the one hand we can numerically evaluate the role of mesonic loops and thus quantitatively verify our statements , on the other hand , even if large variations for the states above 1 gev do not occur as we expect , an interesting question is how poles on the complex plane emerge .",

    "we have thus constructed a single model that contains ( pseudo)scalars and ( axial-)vectors both in the non - strange and strange channels . to our knowledge , this is the first time that such a comprehensive approach has been presented .",
    "the model , dubbed extended linear sigma model ( elsm ) , has allowed us to study the overall phenomenology of mesons and , in particular , to explore the nature of scalar and axial - vector resonances . in order to test our model we have performed a global fit to @xmath282 experimental quantities involving both the ( pseudo)scalar and the ( axial-)vector masses and decays . due to mixing with the scalar glueball (",
    "not included here explicitly , because its coupling to the other mesons was neglected ) , we did not include the scalar - isoscalar resonances in the fit .",
    "similarly , we have omitted the axial - vector resonance @xmath553 due to the fact that in reality a large mixing of two kaonic fields from the @xmath274 and @xmath275 nonets takes place .",
    "one of the central questions of our discussion has been the assignment of the scalar states : to this end we have tested the possible scenarios for the isotriplet and isodoublet scalar states by assigning our scalar fields @xmath161 to @xmath10 or @xmath11 and @xmath131 to @xmath13 or @xmath15 .",
    "the outcome is univocal : the global fit works well only if the states @xmath11 and @xmath554 are interpreted as quark - antiquark states . on the contrary ,",
    "the other combinations deliver unacceptably large values of @xmath283 , see table  [ tab : khi ] .",
    "we thus conclude that the scalar @xmath9 and @xmath12 states lie above 1 gev and have to be identified with the resonances @xmath11 and @xmath29 moreover , the overall phenomenology described by the fit is very good , see table  [ comparison1 ] .",
    "it is then possible to properly describe many different mesonic masses and decays within a unified treatment based on the symmetries of qcd .",
    "it should be stressed that the inclusion of the ( axial-)vector mesons has a crucial impact on our results and represents the most important new ingredient of our approach .",
    "the good agreement with data also shows that the axial - vector mesons can be interpreted , just as their vector chiral partners , as quark - antiquark states .",
    "we have then studied the consequences of our fit .",
    "we have primarily concentrated on the scalar - isoscalar sector which was not included in the fit . in the limit @xmath555 it is possible to make clear predictions for the two states @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "their masses lie above 1 gev and their decay patterns have led us to identify @xmath159 with ( predominantly ) @xmath5 and @xmath160 with ( predominantly ) @xmath68 the theoretical decay rates of @xmath159 are in agreement with experiment ; @xmath160 decays only into kaons , but turns out to be too wide . at a qualitative level",
    ", this large-@xmath57 result clearly shows that also the scalar - isoscalar quark - antiquark states lie above 1 gev .",
    "the overall situation in the scalar - isoscalar sector can be slightly improved when adding large-@xmath57 suppressed terms .",
    "some of these terms correspond to interactions between mesons and a glueball state .",
    "these were neglected here , but are necessary for a full quantitative study .",
    "then starting from @xmath556 , @xmath557 , and @xmath558 one aims to describe properly @xmath559 @xmath560 and @xmath7 .",
    "additionally , we have studied other consequences of the fit , such as predictions for the @xmath488 channel of scalar - isoscalar states , the @xmath561-@xmath123 mixing , the prediction for the axial - vector kaonic state , and for the @xmath161 branching ratios .",
    "finally , we have also discussed the origin of the mass of the @xmath39 meson and , at a qualitative level , its possible value at nuclear matter density .",
    "there is , however , one question that remains open .",
    "interpreting resonances above 1 gev as @xmath1 states leads to questions about the nature of @xmath3 , @xmath562 @xmath4 , and @xmath13 .",
    "their presence is necessary for the correct description of @xmath158 scattering lengths [ see , e.g.  ref .",
    "there are two possibilities : ( _ i _ ) they can arise as ( quasi-)molecular states of @xmath158 or @xmath424 , respectively , or ( _ ii _ ) as tetraquark states @xcite .",
    "the question is whether the attraction is large enough so that these states are bound , or whether the attraction is not sufficient so that they are ( unstable ) resonances in the continuum .",
    "this question and deciding whether possibility ( _ i _ ) or ( _ ii _ ) is realized in nature represent interesting starting points for future studies , along the lines of the bethe - salpeter approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , the lattice approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , or even holographic approaches such as those presented in ref .",

    "the present model can be also studied in the baryonic sector , see ref .",
    "@xcite for the two - flavor case .",
    "the very same ideas of chiral symmetry and dilatation invariance can be applied to the baryonic sector as well .",
    "the extension of the model to three flavors in the baryonic sector would surely represent an interesting problem : a multitude of data on decays and masses is available to make a precise test of our approach .",
    "additionally , restoration of chiral symmetry at nonzero temperature and density is one of the fundamental questions of modern hadron physics , see , e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite , in which the two - flavor version of this model has been studied at nonzero density , or ref .",
    "@xcite for alternative approaches to the exploration of nonzero chemical potential .",
    "linear sigma models are appropriate to study chiral symmetry restoration because they contain from the onset not only ( pseudo)scalar and ( axial-)vector mesons but also their chiral partners ; mass degeneration of chiral partners represents a signal for the chiral transition .",
    "therefore , we also plan to apply the model to study chiral symmetry restoration at nonzero temperatures and densities .",
