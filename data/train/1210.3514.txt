    "studies of solitons in spatially periodic ( lattice ) potentials have grown into a vast area of research , with profoundly important applications to nonlinear optics , plasmonics , and matter waves in quantum gases , as outlined in recent reviews @xcite . in ultracold bosonic and fermionic gases ,",
    "periodic potentials can be created , in the form of optical lattices , by coherent laser beams illuminating the gas in opposite directions @xcite .",
    "effective lattice potentials for optical waves are induced by photonic crystals , which are built as permanent structures by means of various techniques @xcite , or as laser - induced virtual structures in photorefractive crystals @xcite .",
    "parallel to the progress in the experiments , the study of the interplay between the nonlinearity and periodic potentials has been an incentive for the rapid developments of theoretical methods @xcite .",
    "both the experimental and theoretical results reveal that solitons can be created in lattice potentials , if they do not exist in the uniform space [ this is the case of gap solitons ( gss ) supported by the self - defocusing nonlinearity , see original works @xcite and reviews @xcite ] , and solitons may be stabilized , if they are unstable without the lattice ( multidimensional solitons in the case of self - focusing , as shown in refs .",
    "bbb , ym , ym2,bbb2,barcelona , bbb3,bbb4,thawatchai , see also reviews rev0,rev2,rev3 ) .",
    "the stability of gss has been studied in detail too  chiefly , close to edges of the corresponding bandgaps  in one stability1,stability2,jc and two @xcite dimensions alike .",
    "an essential extension of the theme is the study of two - component solitons in lattice potentials . in particular ,",
    "if both the self - phase - modulation and cross - phase - modulation ( spm and xpm ) nonlinearities , i.e. , intra- and inter - species interactions , are repulsive , one can construct two - component gss of _ intra - gap _ and _ inter - gap _ types , with chemical potentials of the components ( or propagation constants , in terms of optical media ) falling , respectively , into the same or different bandgaps of the underlying linear spectrum @xcite . in the case of the attractive spm , a family of stable _ semi - gap solitons _",
    "was found too , with one component residing in the infinite gap , while the other stays in a finite bandgap @xcite .",
    "the gss supported by the xpm repulsion dominating over the intrinsic ( spm - mediated ) attraction may be regarded as an example of _ symbiotic solitons_. in the free space ( without the lattice potential ) , symbiotic solitons are supported by the xpm attraction between their two components , despite the action of the repulsive spm in each one @xcite .",
    "this mechanism may be additionally enhanced by the linear coupling ( interconversion ) between the components sadhan2 .",
    "another case of the  symbiosis \" was reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the action of the lattice potential on a single component was sufficient for the stabilization of two - dimensional ( 2d ) two - component solitons against the collapse , the stabilizing effect of the lattice on the second component being mediated by the xpm interaction .",
    "in addition , the attraction between the components , competing with the intrinsic repulsion , may cause spatial splitting between two components of the gs , as for these components , whose effective masses are negative @xcite , the attractive interaction potential gives rise to a repulsion force @xcite",
    ".    the ultimate form of the model which gives rise to two - component gss of the symbiotic type is the one with no intra - species nonlinearity , the formation of the gss being accounted for by the interplay of the repulsion between the components and the lattice potential acting on both of them . in optics ,",
    "the setting with the xpm - only interactions is known in the form of the  holographic nonlinearity \" , which can be induced in photorefractive crystals for a pair of coherent beams with a small angle between their wave vectors , giving rise to single- @xcite and double - peak holokiv solitons .",
    "both beams are made by splitting a single laser signal , hence the power ratio between them ( which is essential for the analysis reported below ) can be varied by changing the splitting conditions .",
    "the creation of 2d spatial  holographic solitons \" in a photorefractive - photovoltaic crystal with the self - focusing nonlinearity was demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite ( such solitons are stable , as the collapse is arrested by the saturation of the self - focusing ) .",
    "to implement the situation considered here , the sign of the nonlinearity may be switched to self - defocusing by the reversal of the bias voltage , and the effective lattice potential may be induced by implanting appropriate dopants , with the concentration periodically modulated in one direction , which will render the setting quasi - one - dimensional .    in binary bosonic gases , a similar setting may be realized by switching off the spm nonlinearity with the help of the feshbach resonance , although one may need to apply two different spatially uniform control fields ( one magnetic and one optical ) to do it simultaneously in both components . on the other hand ,",
    "the same setting is natural for a mixture of two fermionic components with the repulsive interaction between them , which may represent two states of the same atomic species , with different values of the total atomic spin ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "if spins of both components are polarized by an external magnetic field , the spm  nonlinearity will be completely suppressed by the pauli blockade while the inter - component interaction remains active stoof , hence the setting may be described by a pair of schrdinger equations for the two wave functions , coupled by xpm terms .",
    "the objective of this work is to present basic families of one - dimensional symbiotic gss , supported solely by the repulsive xpm nonlinearity in the combination with the lattice potential , and analyze their stability , via the computation of eigenvalues for small perturbations and direct simulations of the perturbed evolution .",
    "the difference from the previously studied models of symbiotic solitons @xcite is that the solitons where created there by the spm nonlinearity separately in each component , while the xpm interaction determined the interaction between them and a possibility of creating two - component bound states . here",
    ", the two - component gss may exist solely due to the repulsive xpm interactions between the components .",
    "we conclude that the symmetric solitons , built of equal components , are destabilized by symmetry - breaking perturbations above a certain critical value of the soliton s power .",
    "the analysis is chiefly focused on asymmetric symbiotic gss , and on breathers into which unstable solitons are transformed .",
    "the model is introduced in section ii , which is followed by the analytical approximation presented in section iii .",
    "it is an extended ( tailed \" ) version of the thomas - fermi approximation , tfa , which may be applied to other models too . in section iv , we report systematic numerical results obtained for fundamental solitons of both the intra- and inter - gap types , hosted by the first two finite bandgaps of the system s spectrum .",
    "the most essential findings are summarized in the form of plots showing the change of the gs stability region with the variation of the degree of asymmetry of the two - component symbiotic solitons , which is a new feature exhibited by the present system .",
    "in particular , the stability area of intra - gap solitons shrinks with the increase of the asymmetry , while inter - gap solitons may be stable only if the asymmetry is large enough , in favor of the first - bandgap component , and intra - gap solitons in the second bandgap are completely unstable .",
    "the paper is concluded by section v.",
