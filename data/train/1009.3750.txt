    "in an epoch in which we count with a new powerful generation of stellar atmopshere codes including all the important physics for the modelling of massive ob stars , with ( clusters of ) high efficiency computers allowing the computation of large grids of stellar models in more than reasonable computational times , and with the possibility to obtain good quality , medium resolution spectra of hundreds o and b - type stars in clusters outside the milky way in just one snapshot ( see e.g. the _ flames i & ii surveys of massive stars _ , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* evans et al . 2008 ) , @xcite ; see also lennon et al . , these proceedings )",
    ", the compilation of medium and high - resolution spectroscopic databases of ob stars in our galaxy is becoming more and more important .",
    "with this idea in mind , two years ago we began to compile the iacob spectroscopic database , aiming at constructing the largest database of multiepoch , high resolution , high signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) spectra of galactic northern ob - type stars .",
    "the iacob perfectly complements the efforts also devoted in the last years by the gosss ( p.i .",
    "maz - apellaniz ; see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sota et al . , these proceedings ) ) and the own ( p.i s barb & gamen , leading a multi - epoch , high - resolution spectroscopic survey of galactic o and wr stars in the southern hemisphere ; see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* barb et al . 2010 ) ) teams .",
    "we are using the fies spectrograph at the 2.56 m nordic optical telescope ( not ) in the roque de los muchachos observatory ( la palma , spain ) to compile spectra for the iacob .",
    "a summary of the instrumental configuration and observing dates ( before sept .",
    "2010 ) is presented in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "spectra of @xmath0100 stars with spectral types earlier than b2 and luminosity classes ranging from i ( supergiants ) to v ( dwarfs ) have already been compiled .",
    "the o - type targets were selected among those stars with v@xmath18 included in the gos catalogue ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gosc , maz - apellniz et al . 2004 ) ) .",
    "the main part of the b - type stars sample correspond to the works presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the final spectra normally have s / n  @xmath2  200 .",
    "there are already two published papers using data from the iacob ( and several more in preparation ) . in @xcite",
    ", we used the stellar atmosphere code fastwind ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* puls et al . 2005 ) ) to perform a thorough self - consistent spectroscopic analysis of 13 early b - type stars from the various subgroups comprising the orionob1 association ; this study showed that the dispersion of o and si abundances between stars in the various subgroups found in previous analyses ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* cunha & lambert 1992 ) ) was a spurious result , being the consequence of a bad characterization of the abundance errors propagated from the uncertainties in the stellar parameter determination .",
    "in @xcite we showed the first observational evidence for a correlation between macroturbulent broadening and line - profile variations in ob supergiants using spectroscopic timeseries for a sample of 13 obsgs ; this may support the hypothesis that macroturbulent broadening in this type of stars is likely a result of the collective effect of stellar pulsations .",
    "a subsample of iacob spectra has been used within the _ flames - ii survey of massive stars : the tarantula survey _ consortium to construct an atlas of medium resolution spectra of galactic ob - type stars ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sana et al . in prep . ) ) .",
    "we plan to use this atlas for the spectral classification of the massive stars in 30 dor .",
    "finally , the scientific exploitation of the iacob spectra concerning the quantitative spectroscopic analysis of the stars has already began and a series of papers with results will be published soon ( see more details in the paper devoted to the presentation of the iacob database ( * ? ? ? * simn - daz et al . , in prep . ) ) .",
    "in the next semesters , we will continue with the compilation of spectra for the iacob , observing stars with v@xmath18 in at least three epochs ( more in the case of known or newly detected binaries ) .",
    "our idea is to make public the database via the virtual observatory in the next year . in the meantime",
    ", interested people can have access to the database under request to the author ( ssimon@iac.es ) .",
    "the complete list of stars will be published in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* simn - daz et al . , in prep . ) .",
    "we will acknowledge any observer who having obtained fies spectra will like to add the spectra to the iacob database after scientific exploitation ."
