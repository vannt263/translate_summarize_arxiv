    "the noncommutative a - ideal is a knot invariant that generalizes the a - polynomial of cooper , culler , gillet , long , and shalen .",
    "it was introduced in the framework of quantum topology .",
    "recall that the a - polynomial is computed from the pull back to the ring of polynomials , through a sequence of rational maps , of the ideal that determines the character variety of the knot complement .",
    "the noncommutative a - ideal is a deformation of this ideal with respect to a parameter , and is a finitely generated ideal in the quantum plane .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to find the noncommutative a - ideal of the figure - eight knot .",
    "the computation is based on skein operations in the knot complement and on the noncommutative trigonometry of the noncommutative torus . while the formulas we obtain are complicated and not at all illuminating , there are three observations that can be extracted from this work .",
    "first , the fact that the noncommutative a - ideal of the figure - eight knot can be computed . up to now only the a - ideals of the unknot , trefoil , and to some extent @xmath0-torus knots have been determined .",
    "but the complements of all these knots are seifert fibered spaces , which is a true advantage when computing quantum invariants .",
    "the present paper is the first example of a computation of the noncommutative a - ideal for a hyperbolic knot .",
    "second , our methods can be adapted to give a pictorial way of computing the ( classical ) a - polynomial of the figure - eight knot .",
    "the work is done in the ring of functions on the @xmath1-character variety of the knot complement .",
    "it will be seen below that an important role is played by the characters of irreducible representations of @xmath1 .",
    "finally , as a corollary of our work , we discovered that the noncommutative a - ideal of the figure - eight knot determines all colored kauffman brackets of this knot .",
    "more precisely , any knot that has the same a - ideal as the figure - eight knot has the same colored kauffman brackets , in the zero framing of the knot . recall that the colored kauffman brackets are obtained by evaluating the classical kauffman bracket on the colorings of the knot by jones - wenzl idempotents .",
    "this property is a consequence of the so called `` orthogonality relation '' between the a - ideal and the jones polynomial .",
    "it has been proved before that the noncommutative a - ideals of the unknot and the @xmath0-torus knots determine their colored kauffman brackets .",
    "we now suggest the hypothesis that this property is true for all knots .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we recall the definitions of the a - polynomial and of the noncommutative a - ideal , together with some basic facts about the structure of the kauffman bracket skein algebra of the torus . in section 3",
    "we explain briefly how the kauffman bracket skein module of the complement of the figure - eight knot is computed , which is the content of an unpublished theorem of bullock and lofaro . in section 4",
    "we perform the skein computations that carry all specific information about the action of the kauffman bracket skein algebra of the torus on the skein module of the knot complement .",
    "section 5 computes the generators of the peripheral ideal of the knot , which is the left ideal sent to zero by the map from the skein algebra of the boundary torus to the skein module of the knot complement .",
    "this ideal determines the noncommutative a - ideal , exhibited in the next section .",
    "section 7 contains what we consider the most important result of the paper , a theorem showing that the a - ideal of the figure - eight knot determines all its colored kauffman brackets .",
    "the authors would like to thank fumikazu nagasato for discovering and correcting an error that appeared in proposition 5.4 below .",
    "the computation of the a - polynomial of a knot is based on the following sequence of rational maps @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the character varieties of @xmath1-representations of the fundamental group of the knot complement , respectively the torus .",
    "the first map is the inclusion , the second is the 2 - 1 covering map of the character variety , and the third is obtain by restricting representations to loops on the boundary of the knot complement .",
    "if we send @xmath3 to @xmath5 through this sequence , we obtain a closed algebraic set whose one dimensional part is determined by the a - polynomial ( times @xmath6 ) ( see @xcite ) .",
    "considering the rings of regular functions on these varieties , we obtain the dual sequence of maps @xmath7\\hookrightarrow { \\mathbb c}[l , l^{-1},m , m^{-1 } ] \\hookleftarrow { \\mathbb c}[l , l^{-1},m , m^{-1}]^{inv } \\rightarrow { \\mathcal f } ( x(m))\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath8^{inv}={\\mathcal f}(x({\\mathbb t}^2 ) ) $ ] is the ring of functions on the character variety of the torus , which consists of the laurent polynomials that are invariant under the simultaneous transformations @xmath9 , and @xmath10 ; and @xmath11 is the ring of regular functions on the character variety of the knot complement .",

    "now recall that the kauffman bracket skein module of a 3-manifold @xmath15 , denoted by @xmath16 , is the quotient of the free @xmath17$]-module with basis the isotopy classes of links in @xmath15 by the submodule spanned by relations of the form @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where the links in each expression are identical except in a ball in which they look like depicted . since in the computations below we will divide by polynomials , we slightly change the point of view , working over the field @xmath20 instead of the ring of laurent polynomials @xmath17 $ ] .",

    "so our modules are in fact vector spaces , but for historical considerations we will keep the name .    at @xmath23 , @xmath24 endowed with the multiplication induced by the disjoint union of links , is a ring . as explained in @xcite and @xcite , when reduced by @xmath25 , it is isomorphic to @xmath11 , the ring of regular function on the @xmath1-character variety .    for the cylinder over a surface @xmath26 , @xmath27 is an algebra . here and below @xmath28",

    "it was shown in @xcite that the kauffman bracket skein algebra of the cylinder over the torus is isomorphic to the algebra generated by noncommutative cosines in the noncommutative torus .",
    "the proof relies on the product - to - sum formula in @xmath30 , which will play an important role in this paper , so we remind it to the reader .",

    "we make the following remarks .",
    "the a - polynomial is usually determined by looking first at the representation variety of the fundamental group , then using elimination theory to obtain relations at the level of character variety . in this sense",
    "the computation is `` geometric '' - it is done at the level of the underlying geometric space .    now if in the computations of this paper we substitute @xmath21 by @xmath57 , then , with appropriate modifications to account for the problem with @xmath22th roots of unity ( see below ) ,",
    "we obtain an `` algebraic '' computation of the a - polynomial .",
    "this means that we study the ring of functions on the character variety , instead of the character variety itself .",
    "a nice feature of this approach is that it can be done pictorially .",

    "since @xcite has not been published yet , we give here a brief overview of how the kauffman bracket skein module of the complement of the figure - eight knot is computed .",
    "the complement of this knot is obtained by attaching a 2-handle to a genus two handlebody along the curve described in figure 3.2 . in the picture",

    "the skein module of the knot complement is obtained by factoring by the submodule corresponding to slidings of skeins through the 2-handle .",
    "this submodule is generated by slidings of basis elements .",
    "clearly after attaching the handle @xmath74 and @xmath83 are isotopic .",
    "thus we conclude that the kauffman bracket skein module of the knot complement is obtained by factoring the free module with basis @xmath84 by the submodule @xmath85 generated by @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the slide of @xmath76 through the 2-handle .    now sliding through the 2-handle amounts to taking the banded sum with the attaching curve .",
    "of course this can be done in infinitely many ways , but as explained in @xcite , we only need to consider one such banded sum , and we will always consider the one from figure 3.4 .",

    "when we slide the trivial link ( that is when we consider the attaching curve as a skein itself ) , we obtain a polynomial of the form @xmath92 terms of lower degree . through an unpleasant but routine computation",
    "one finds this polynomial , and also the ones for @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "linear combinations of them yield polynomials of degrees @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 in @xmath76 . hence @xmath85 is generated by polynomials of the form @xmath98 terms of lower degree in @xmath76 , one for each @xmath99 .",
