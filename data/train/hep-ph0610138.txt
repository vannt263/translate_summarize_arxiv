    "qcd is not a perturbative theory at low energy regime .",
    "consequently , one does not know how to systematically study the structure of the ground and excited baryon states except , in principle , for lattice calculations .",
    "large @xmath2 qcd @xcite introduces a new perturbative series where the parameter is the inverse of the number of colors @xmath2 .",
    "the resulting @xmath0 expansion approach has proven to be an interesting way to study baryon spectroscopy .",
    "the success is due to the discovery in 1984 , by gervais and sakita @xcite and independently , during the ninetieths , by dashen and manohar @xcite , from the study of baryon - meson scattering process in the @xmath3 limit , that ground state baryons satisfy a contracted su(@xmath4 spin - flavor algebra where @xmath5 is the number of flavors .",
    "this means that when @xmath6 , ground state baryons form an infinite tower of degenerate states . at @xmath6 ,",
    "the su(@xmath7 algebra used in the constituent quark model becomes the su(@xmath4 algebra .",
    "one can therefore use su(@xmath8 ) to classify large @xmath2 baryons and calculate matrix elements of various static observables .",
    "if su(@xmath8 ) is broken the degenerate baryon states split at order @xmath0 .",
    "the first studies of excited baryons in the large @xmath2 limit suggested that constituent quark baryons can be reduced to a symmetric core composed of @xmath9 ground state quarks and one excited quark .",
    "the advantage is that one can treat the core in the same way as a ground state baryon .",
    "however , with this approach , the su(@xmath8 ) symmetry is broken at order @xmath10 instead of @xmath11 as for the ground state  @xcite .",
    "this generates the conceptual problem that in the @xmath3 limit , excited states do not form anymore an infinite tower of degenerate states .",
    "furthermore , excited states are resonances and have widths of order @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , baryons belonging to various su(6 ) excited multiplets have been studied with success during the last ten years @xcite .",
    "more or less , all these studies consider excited baryons as bound states and split the su(@xmath8 ) generators into two parts , one acting on the symmetric core and the other on the excited quark .",
    "accordingly , the number of invariant operators needed in the description of observables becomes exceedingly large and the splitting starts at order @xmath10 .",
    "fortunately , these studies show that the @xmath13 breaking is small .    recently , a new approach of the @xmath14 $ ] multiplet solved this conceptual problem by removing the splitting of generators and using orbital - flavor - spin wave functions respecting the permutation symmetry @xcite .",
    "still , the excited baryons as considered as bound states .    below we shall analyze the @xmath1 $ ] multiplets with @xmath15 = 0 or 2 in the standard approach with splitting .",
    "the constituent quark model suggests that @xmath1 $ ] baryons are composed of one or two excited quarks and @xmath16 ground state quarks . the standard procedure , used in ref .",
    "@xcite , for calculating the mass spectrum is to reduce the wave function to that of a product of a symmetric orbital and a symmetric flavor - spin wave function for the core of @xmath9 quarks times the wave function of one excited quark .",
    "this implies that the total orbital - flavor - spin wave function is truncated to a single term , described by the product of two young tableaux , each with the excited quark in the second row .",
    "many others terms , related to young tableaux with the excited quark in the first row , are neglected @xcite . at the same time each su(6 ) and so(3 ) generator is splitted into two terms , one acting on the core and the other on the excited quark .",
    "we assume that baryons are bound states .",
    "the mass operator must be rotationally invariant , parity and time reversal even .",
    "for the @xmath17 $ ] multiplet it has the following structure : @xmath18}=\\sum^6_{i=1}c_io_i + d_1b_1+d_2b_2+d_4b_4,\\ ] ] where @xmath19 are rotational invariants and su(3)-flavor scalars , the operators @xmath20 provide su(3 ) breaking and are defined to have non - vanishing matrix elements for strange baryons only and the coefficients @xmath21 and @xmath22 , which encode the qcd dynamics , are unknown .",
    "one can obtain these coefficients from a fit to experimental data .",
    "as the number of data is limited , we have to make a selection among all the possible operators .",
    "the first column of table [ operators ] shows the list of operators chosen for this study as thought to be the most dominant one .",
    "the choice is based on previous studies @xcite .",
    "they are composed of su(6)@xmath23so(3 ) generators .",
    "generators @xmath24 refer to the core part of the wave function and @xmath25 and @xmath26 act on the excited quark . besides the so(3 ) generators which are of rank @xmath27 we also need to introduce the rank @xmath28 tensor operator @xmath29    for deriving the matrix elements of the operators @xmath19 and @xmath20 , we first needed to calculate the matrix elements of the core generators , the problem being trivial for the excited quark ( single particle operators ) .",
    "it is not always an obvious task . to obtain the matrix elements ,",
    "we have used a generalized wigner - eckart theorem and then derived su(6 ) isoscalar factors .",
    "we have obtained analytic expressions for these isoscalar factors for su(6 ) symmetric wave functions @xmath30 \\rangle $ ] containing any number of quarks @xcite .",
    "the mixed symmetric case needs considerable group theory work . to our knowledge ,",
    "isoscalar factors for mixed symmetric states @xmath31 \\rangle $ ] which can be applied to baryons composed of @xmath2 quarks @xcite for @xmath32 are yet inexistent .",
    "that is why , presently , it is not possible to treat the @xmath1 $ ] multiplet composed of strange baryons without simplifying the baryon wave function and splitting the su(6 ) generators .",
    "[ operators ]    [ cols=\"<,<,>,>,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     in table [ operators ] , @xmath33 is the su(6 ) scalar operator linear in @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath34 and @xmath35 are the dominant part of the spin - orbit and spin - spin operators respectively .",
    "the first , which acts only on the excited quark , is of order @xmath12 but the two - body spin - spin operator is of order @xmath36 . the operators @xmath37 and @xmath38 are of order @xmath12 due to the presence of the su(6 ) generator @xmath39 which sums coherently .",
    "@xmath40 represents the isospin - isospin operator , having matrix elements of order @xmath12 due to @xmath41 which sums coherently too .",
    "as already mentioned , the operators @xmath20 break the su(3)-flavor symmetry .",
    "the operators @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the standard breaking operators while @xmath44 is directly related to the spin - orbit splitting .",
    "they break the su(3)-flavor symmetry to first order .",
    "the second column of table [ operators ] gives the values of the coefficients @xmath21 and @xmath22 resulting form the fit .",
    "the @xmath45 obtained is 1.0 .",
    "details concerning the calculations and data used in the fit are presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "one can see that the first order operator @xmath33 and the spin - spin operator @xmath35 are the most dominant ones , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath46 and @xmath47 are large .",
    "the spin - orbit coefficient is negative , at variance with previous studies @xcite but remains small in absolute value .",
    "the coefficient @xmath48 is twice smaller in absolute value as compared to that of ref .",
    "we had to exclude the operator @xmath38 from the fit because it considerably deteriorated the @xmath45 .",
    "this study suggests that the isospin - isospin operator does not play an important role , the coefficient @xmath49 being small .",
    "possibly , this is a consequence of the splitting of generators and of the truncation of the baryon wave function . in the improved approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , applied to the analysis of the @xmath50 $ ] multiplet , the isospin term appears to have the same importance as the spin term .    the su(3)-flavor breaking operators play an important dynamical role as it can be seen from the values of the coefficients @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "as all the matrix elements of @xmath44 cancel out for the available resonances , it was not possible for us to obtain an estimation of @xmath53 .",
    "figure [ c2 ] shows the evolution of the spin - spin dynamical coefficient @xmath47 with the excitation energy .",

    "this figure suggests that at large excitations , the spin - spin contribution vanishes .     with the excitation energy corresponding to @xmath57 and 4 bands in a harmonic oscillator notation.,width=283 ]",
    "we have shown results obtained for the masses of resonances which we identified as belonging to the @xmath58 $ ] and @xmath59 $ ] multiplets .",
    "the present results confirm the dependence of the coefficients @xmath46 , @xmath60 and @xmath47 as a function of excitation energy , namely that the contributions of the spin - dependent terms decrease with energy and eventually vanish at very large excitations  @xcite .",
    "the analysis of @xmath1 $ ] remains open .",
    "more and better experimental data are needed to clarify the role of various terms contributing to the mass operator of the @xmath1 $ ] multiplet .",
