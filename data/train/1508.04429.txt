    "historically , the thick disc of the milky way was first identified through star counts toward the galactic poles as a vertically extended disc component with scale height @xmath5 1 kpc @xcite , in addition to the thin disc with scale height @xmath6 that dominates the disc stars in the immediate solar neighbourhood .",
    "therefore , at the outset , the tentative definition of the thick - disc stars was those disc stars with large vertical orbital excursions and large vertical velocities .    later",
    ", spectroscopic studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) on kinematically - selected disc stars suggested that stars with large vertical motions ( which are likely to belong to the thick disc ) tend to show lower [ fe / h ] and higher [ @xmath7/fe ] than those with small vertical motions ( thin - disc stars ) .",
    "these chemical properties suggest that the thick - disc stars are older than thin - disc stars ( lower [ fe / h ] ) and that the star formation timescale of the thick disc was shorter than that of the thin disc ( higher [ @xmath7/fe ] ) .",
    "recently , klaus fuhrmann @xcite investigated a kinematically - unbiased volume - complete sample of solar - type disc and halo stars located within 25 pc of the sun .",
    "the distribution of his sample stars in the [ fe / h]-[mg / fe ] space reveals two chemically distinct populations of disc stars ( see figure 15 of @xcite ) .",
    "based on the kinematical properties of these populations , he identified the lower-[fe / h ] and higher-[mg / fe ] population to be the thick disc , and the other population to be the thin disc .",
    "this clear separation between the thin and thick discs is also confirmed in the nearby ( heliocentric distance @xmath8 100 pc ) kinematically - unbiased sample of @xcite for which [ fe / h ] and [ @xmath7/fe ] are available through high - resolution spectroscopy .",
    "these recent observations suggest that the thick disc is better defined by chemical compositions of stars , especially by [ fe / h ] and [ @xmath7/fe ] @xcite .    in the past decades",
    ", our understanding of the structure of the thick disc towards the galactic poles has been greatly improved @xcite .",
    "the next step forward is to unravel its more global structure , such as the radial dependence of its vertical structure .",
    "so far , many attempts have been made to fulfil this goal , and they are broadly categorised into two classes of studies .    the first class of studies are based on nearby samples of disc stars .",
    "one such example is @xcite , who fitted the distribution of local disc stars with his distribution function model .",
    "he discussed some global structure of the thick disc by looking into his best - fit models .",
    "although this kind of studies can predict almost everything if the best - fit models are reasonably correct , one critical problem with these studies is the validity of the functional forms of the assumed distribution functions .    the second class of studies are based on in - situ samples of ( relatively ) distant disc stars .",
    "this class can be further categorised into three sub - classes : those studies using ( i ) high - resolution spectroscopic samples ; ( ii ) medium - resolution spectroscopic samples ; or ( iii ) photometric samples .",
    "the advantage of sub - class ( i ) studies is that we can define the thick disc purely by means of the stellar chemistry @xcite .",
    "however , the number of stars that are currently available is less than a few hundred , and this small sample size makes it hard to obtain some statistical properties of distant disc stars",
    ". also , since the errors in distance and proper motion are large , kinematical analyses are difficult for these stars . in the sub - class ( ii ) studies , much larger sample of stars are available than in the sub - class ( i ) studies .",
    "a recent example of this sub - class is @xcite , who studied the density distribution of chemically defined disc populations by fitting the sdss / segue data with analytic models of the density profile .",
    "however , since the chemical abundances of these samples are less accurate than high - resolution samples , some blending of the thin- and thick - disc stars is inevitable in this kind of studies . most of the sub - class ( iii ) studies are based on the star count method ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "photometric samples are advantageous in grasping the global structure of the stellar disc because the available sample size is the largest among these subclasses , and because the sample stars cover a wide range of heliocentric distance . however , since the photometric data lack chemical information for each sample star , it is not possible to separate the sample into stellar components .",
    "this inseparability means that one needs to adequately model all the stellar components that contribute to the sample , which is harder than adequately modelling the thick disc only .    by taking into account these problems , in this paper",
    "we explore the possibility of constraining the global structure of the thick disc based on a small number of nearby chemically - selected stars , but not relying on analytic modelling of the thick disc . specifically , we reconstruct the distribution function of the thick disc within a certain portion of the action space which is accessible from local observations .",
    "this paper is organised in the following manner .",
    "first , we describe our sample stars in section [ section : sample ] . in section [ section : theory ] , we introduce the concepts of the observable action space @xmath9 and the observable distribution function @xmath10 . there , we discuss the possibility of inferring some information on the velocity dispersion of the thick disc by using @xmath10 . in section [ section : method ] , we present our method to reconstruct @xmath10 from a local sample of thick - disc stars . in section",
    "[ section : analysis ] , we present our main results .",
    "the implications from our study are discussed in section [ section : discussion ] , and section [ section : conclusion ] sums up our analyses .",
    "in this paper , we assume that the milky way potential is axisymmetric and adopt the usual galactocentric cylindrical coordinate system @xmath11 to describe the three - dimensional positions of stars in the milky way .",
    "the three - dimensional velocities along the respective coordinates are denoted by @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is positive outwards , @xmath14 is positive in the direction of galactic rotation , and @xmath15 is positive in the direction of the north galactic pole .",
    "we assume that the local standard of rest ( lsr ) is in a circular orbit with a rotation speed of @xmath16 @xcite and that the galactocentric distance of the sun is @xmath17 .",
    "we also adopt the peculiar motion of the sun with respect to the lsr determined by @xcite .      in this paper , we assume that the thick disc of the milky way is a single stellar population and define the thick - disc stars to be those stars with @xmath18 } \\leq -0.2 $ ] and @xmath19 } \\geq 0.2 $ ] , by taking into account the solar neighbour observations of disc stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we constructed a kinematically - unbiased sample of 127 thick - disc stars , for which accurate position , velocity , [ fe / h ] , and [ mg / fe ] are available .",
    "84 stars in our sample were taken from @xcite , and the other 43 stars were taken from @xcite .",
    "most of our sample stars are distributed within 100 pc from the sun .",
    "@xcite published a kinematically - unbiased sample of 1111 stars , for which accurate [ fe / h ] and [ mg / h ] estimated from high - resolution spectroscopic observations as well as the three dimensional cartesian velocity based on hipparcos observations are available .",
    "we derived the distances and the line - of - sight velocities for 1103 stars in their sample that were also included in the updated hipparcos catalog of @xcite .",
    "in the course of this inversion , we took into account the solar peculiar motion adopted in @xcite and we used the three - dimensional cartesian velocity taken from @xcite and the position on the sky and the proper motion taken from @xcite .",
    "we then calculated the three - dimensional velocity @xmath12 in our coordinate system , by using our assumption on @xmath20 . from these 1103 stars , we selected those stars that satisfy both the thick - disc chemical criteria ( @xmath18 } \\leq -0.2 $ ] and @xmath19 } \\geq 0.2 $ ] ) and the kinematical criteria of @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the latter velocity cuts were applied to minimise possible contamination from halo stars . finally , we discarded those stars that had been flagged as non - single stars , and we obtained 84 stars .",
    "@xcite published a catalog of 743 stars compiled from 11 catalogs of nearby stars and listed the chemical abundances of these stars . among these 11 catalogs ,",
    "those catalogs taken from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite are kinematically unbiased , so we first selected those stars that are included in either of these five catalogs .",
    "then , we excluded those stars that happened to be included in @xcite .",
    "the position and velocity of these stars were then calculated either by using the data from genova - copenhagen survey @xcite or by using the updated hipparcos catalog @xcite and simbad database .",
    "finally , as in the previous subsection , we applied the chemical and velocity criteria and obtained 43 thick - disc stars .",
    "as described above , we adopted a pair of velocity cuts to exclude halo stars . rigorously speaking",
    ", these cuts potentially could have introduced some kinematical bias on our analyses .",
    "however , we have confirmed that adopting a looser velocity constraint of @xmath23 ( without cuts on @xmath13 or @xmath15 ) has only negligible effects on our final results .",
    "the distribution of our sample stars in the [ fe / h]-[mg / fe ] plane is shown in figure [ fig : feh_mgfe ] .",
    "the uncertainties in the chemical abundances are small enough ( typical uncertainties are @xmath24 } = $ ] 0.03 dex and @xmath25 } = $ ] 0.05 dex for the @xcite sample ) compared with the scatter in this diagram .",
    "therefore , our sample does not suffer from severe contamination from low-[mg / fe ] stars .",
    "figure [ fig : velocity_distribution ] shows the velocity distribution of our sample in the @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 planes .",
    "our sample stars show a mean velocity of @xmath30 , and thus lag from the lsr by nearly @xmath31 .",
    "the three - dimensional velocity dispersion is @xmath32 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : separability ] , we show the value of @xmath3 as functions of @xmath14 and @xmath33 . to make these plots , we first sort the sample in @xmath14 or @xmath33 , evaluate the dispersion @xmath3 for a binned sample of @xmath34 stars , and move through the sample in steps of 4 stars ( so that any pair of adjacent bins share 36 stars ) .",
    "the derived value of @xmath3 for each bin is plotted against the median value of @xmath14 or @xmath33 of the bin .",
    "although the bin size of 40 stars is rather large compared with the total sample size of 127 stars , the result of this figure suggests that there is no strong trend in @xmath3 as a function of @xmath33 or @xmath14 .",
    "this property suggests that the vertical kinematics ( @xmath3 ) is not strongly correlated with the in - plane motion ( @xmath33 or @xmath14 ) .",

    "most of the thick - disc stars in the solar neighbourhood are on non - circular orbits .",
    "more specifically , the majority of nearby thick - disc stars have guiding radii smaller than the galactocentric distance of the sun ( @xmath35 ) , due to the asymmetric drift @xcite . therefore ,",
    "if the thick disc is a static stellar system , kinematics of nearby thick - disc stars carry some information on the thick disc outside the solar neighbourhood , especially on the inner part of the thick disc .",
    "of course , nearby thick - disc stars do not carry all the information of the thick disc , since these stars are inherently biased in that they represent a portion of the thick - disc stars whose orbits penetrate through the solar neighbourhood .",
    "in other words , a nearby sample only covers a certain fraction of action space @xmath9 where the corresponding orbits bring stars to the solar neighbourhood @xcite .",
    "hence , the best we can do with nearby samples is to reconstruct the distribution function @xmath36 within this _ observable action space _ @xmath9 , i.e. to reconstruct the _ observable distribution function _ defined by @xmath37",
    "we here note that @xmath38 is different from the as - observed action distribution . the fraction of its orbital period that a given star spends in the solar neighbourhood depends on its orbit , so that the probability of finding the star in the solar neighbourhood depends on its action . in section [",
    "section : method ] , we take into account this probability to reconstruct the observable distribution function @xmath38 .      in order to have a physical insight into @xmath9 , let us consider the velocity space that corresponds to @xmath9 by assuming a potential model of the milky way .",
    "figure [ fig : observable ] shows the allowed range of @xmath4 for disc stars located at @xmath39 kpc with zero vertical velocity to reach the solar neighbourhood . since only a portion of the disc stars at @xmath40 kpc can reach the solar neighbourhood , what we can learn from @xmath10 about the thick disc at @xmath40 kpc is the velocity distribution of stars within the ` observable ' region in figure [ fig : observable ] .    with the information on @xmath10 , we can estimate the _ observable vertical velocity dispersion _ defined by @xmath41 at any given radius @xmath42 on the disc plane .",
    "this dispersion corresponds to the vertical velocity dispersion of those stars located at @xmath42 whose velocities are within the observable region . thus @xmath43 is conceptually different from the ( ordinary ) vertical velocity dispersion given by @xmath44 which is the vertical velocity dispersion of all the stars located at @xmath42 .",

    "the boundary curve between the observable region and unobservable region corresponds to @xmath47 ( @xmath48 is the apocentric distance of the orbit ) , and thus the circular orbit at @xmath40 kpc ( red dot ) lies within the unobservable region . when @xmath49 , the boundary curve slightly shifts downwards in this diagram .",
    "however , this difference is not significant for a typical value of @xmath50 of the thick - disc stars . in this plot",
    ", we assume a realistic potential model of the milky way described in section [ section : analysis ] . ]",
    "here we describe how to reconstruct @xmath38 of the thick disc from a nearby sample of thick - disc stars , based on the idea of @xcite .",
    "we note that @xcite investigated a rigorous treatment of an as - observed distribution function in which survey selection function is taken into account ( see appendix ) .",
    "we do not follow their formulation here since we do not know the exact survey selection function for our sample stars ( but we do know that our sample stars are not kinematically selected ) .",
    "although we do not take into account the survey selection function , our approach has an advantage that we do not have to assume the functional form of the distribution function .      in the following ,",
    "we regard disc stars as test particles moving in the milky way potential .",
    "also , we assume that we have a kinematically - unbiased sample of @xmath51 thick - disc stars which happen to be passing near the sun .    under an axisymmetric potential @xmath52 , each star has three actions @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "let us denote the actions of the @xmath54th star as @xmath55 .",
    "then , the time - averaged distribution function of a single orbit characterised by @xmath55 is expressed as @xmath56 and the corresponding spatial density is given by @xmath57 the value of @xmath58 can be interpreted as the probability density of finding a star with action @xmath55 at position @xmath59 , since @xmath60 @xcite .    by following @xcite , we approximate the observable distribution function @xmath10 to be the weighted sum of single orbit distribution functions given by @xmath61 here , @xmath62 is a selection index that determines whether the @xmath54th star should be included ( @xmath63 ) or not ( @xmath64 ) , which shall be introduced to stabilise our analyses .",

    "this simple choice of @xmath66 corresponds to a limiting case where all of our sample stars have identical position @xcite .",
    "of finding a given star in the solar neighbourhood is equal to the fraction of its orbital period to stay in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "thus , if such a star is observed in the solar neighbourhood , it represents @xmath69 stars in the same orbit ( including those with different orbital phases ) .",
    "] since most of our sample stars are located within 100 pc away from the sun , our simple choice of @xmath66 is well justified .",
    "once @xmath10 is reconstructed , we can estimate the observable vertical velocity dispersion @xmath43 at a given point on the disc plane , by using equation ( [ eq : def_sigz_fobs ] ) .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath70 if the assumed potential is correct and a large enough number of local sample stars are available .",
    "thus , we can perform a sanity check of the adopted potential by seeing if these dispersions reasonably agree with each other .",
    "we adopt a realistic potential model of the milky way , consisting of halo , bulge , and disc components .    in our model ,",

    "in our analyses , we followed the approach of @xcite to relate the observed kinematic data to the underlying distribution function .",
    "we note here that our approach owes much to the fact that our sample stars are located at the immediate solar neighbourhood ( @xmath148 ) .",
    "let us consider a sample of stars taken from an imaginary magnitude - limited survey in which all the stars with apparent magnitude brighter than a certain value are observed . in this case",
    ", those sample stars at large distances are high - luminosity stars , while the sample covers a wider luminosity range for nearby stars .",
    "thus , such a sample puts more weight on nearby stars .",
    "if the kinematical properties are highly inhomogeneous within the surveyed region , this sample is kinematically biased . in general , if the surveyed region is large , the survey selection function has to be taken into account in order to estimate the kinematic properties of the system ( mcmillan & binney 2012 ) .",
    "this means that our methodology is not applicable to a sample that covers a large volume unless the completeness is taken into account , since our method implicitly requires that the sample stars are fair representatives of the stellar population .",
    "however , since our sample is distributed in a small region ( @xmath149 pc ) , it is safe to assume that the kinematical properties of the thick - disc stars are homogeneous inside this region ( the thick disc has a scale height of @xmath150 kpc and a scale length of @xmath151-@xmath152 kpc ) .",
    "therefore , the effect from the ( poorly - known ) survey selection function is relatively small in our sample ."
