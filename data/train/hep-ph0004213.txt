    "the charmless @xmath5 decays arouse more and more interests recently , since it is a good place for study of cp violation and it is also sensitive to new physics @xcite .",
    "factorization approach ( fa ) is applied to hadronic @xmath5 decays and is generalized to decay modes that are classified in the spin of final states @xcite .",
    "fa gives predictions in terms of form factors and decay constants .",
    "although the predictions of branching ratios agree well with experiments in most cases , there are still some theoretical points unclear .",
    "first , it relies strongly on the form factors , which can not be calculated by fa itself .",
    "secondly , the generalized fa shows that the non - factorizable contributions are important in a group of channels @xcite .",
    "the reason of this large non - factorizable contribution needs more theoretical studies .",
    "thirdly , the strong phase , which is important for the cp violation prediction , is quite sensitive to the internal gluon momentum @xcite .",
    "this gluon momentum is the sum of momenta of two quarks , which go into two different mesons .",
    "it is difficult to define exactly in the fa approach . to improve the theoretical predictions of",
    "the non - leptonic @xmath5 decays , we try to improve the factorization approach , and explain the size of the non - factorizable contributions in a new approach .",
    "we shall take a specific channel @xmath6 as an example .",
    "the @xmath6 decays are responsible for the determination of the angle @xmath7 in the unitarity triangle which have been studied in the factorization approach in detail @xcite .",
    "the recent measurements of @xmath8 by cleo collaboration attracted much attention for these kind of decays @xcite . the most recent theoretical study @xcite attempted to compute the non - factorizable diagrams directly .",
    "but it could not also predict the transition form factors of @xmath9 .    in this paper",
    ", we would like to study the @xmath6 decays in the perturbative qcd approach ( pqcd ) @xcite . in",
    "the @xmath6 decays , the @xmath5 meson is heavy , sitting at rest .",
    "it decays into two light mesons with large momenta .",
    "therefore the light mesons are moving very fast in the rest frame of @xmath5 meson .",
    "in this case , the short distance hard process dominates the decay amplitude .",
    "we shall demonstrate that the soft final state interaction is not important , since there is not enough time for the pions to exchange soft gluons .",
    "this makes the perturbative qcd approach applicable . with the final pions moving very fast",
    ", there must be a hard gluon to kick the light spectator quark @xmath10 or @xmath11 ( almost at rest ) in the @xmath5 meson to form a fast moving pion ( see figure [ fig : physicalpicb_1 ] ) .",
    "so the dominant diagram in this theoretical picture is that one hard gluon from the spectator quark connecting with the other quarks in the four quark operator of the weak interaction . unlike the usual fa , where the spectator quark does not participate in the decay process in a major way ,",
    "the hard part of the pqcd approach consists of six quarks rather than four .",
    "we thus call it six - quark operators or six - quark effective theory . applying the six - quark effective theory to @xmath5 meson exclusive decays , we need meson wave functions for the hadronization of quarks into mesons . separating that nonperturbative dynamics from the hard one , the decay amplitudes can be calculated in pqcd easily .",
    "most of the nonperturbative dynamics are included in the meson wave functions , but in the correction that soft gluon straddle the six - quark operators , there are some nonfactorizable soft gluon effects not to be absorbed into the meson wave functions .",
    "such effects can be safely neglected in the @xmath5 meson decays @xcite .",
    "li performed the calculation of @xmath12 in ref.@xcite using the pqcd formalism , where the factorizable tree diagrams were calculated and the branching ratios were predicted . in another paper @xcite , dahm , jakob and kroll performed a more complete calculation , including the non - factorizable annihilation topology and the three decay channels of @xmath13 decays .",
    "however , the predicted branching ratios are about one order smaller than the current experiments by cleo @xcite . in connection with this ,",
    "feldmann and kroll concluded that perturbative contributions to the @xmath9 transition form factor were much smaller than nonperturbative ones @xcite .",
    "as we shall show later , the pion wave function must be consistent with chiral symmetry relation @xmath14 this introduces terms that were not considered in above calculations . in this paper ,",
    "considering the terms needed from chiral symmetry , we calculate the @xmath9 transition form factors and also the non - factorizable contributions in pqcd approach .",
    "we then show that our result for the branching ratio @xmath3 agree with the measurement . among the new terms , it is worthwhile emphasizing the presence of annihilation diagrams which are ignored in fa .",
    "we find that these diagrams can not be ignored , and furthermore they contribute to large final state interaction phase .",
    "the three scale pqcd factorization theorem has been developed for non - leptonic heavy meson decays @xcite , based on the formalism by brodsky and lepage @xcite , and botts and sterman @xcite .",
    "the qcd corrections to the four quark operators are usually summed by the renormalization group equation @xcite .",
    "this has already been done to the leading logarithm and next - to - leading order for years .",
    "since the @xmath15 quark decay scale @xmath16 is much smaller than the electroweak scale @xmath17 , the qcd corrections are non - negligible .",
    "the third scale @xmath18 involved in the @xmath5 meson exclusive decays is usually called the factorization scale , with @xmath15 the conjugate variable of parton transverse momenta . the dynamics below @xmath18 scale",
    "is regarded as being completely nonperturbative , and can be parametrized into meson wave functions .",
    "the meson wave functions are not calculable in pqcd .",
    "but they are universal , channel independent .",
    "we can determine it from experiments , and it is constrained by qcd sum rules and lattice qcd calculations . above the scale @xmath18 , the physics is channel dependent .",
    "we can use perturbation theory to calculate channel by channel .",
    "besides the hard gluon exchange with the spectator quark , the soft gluon exchanges between quark lines give out the double logarithms @xmath19 from the overlap of collinear and soft divergences , @xmath20 being the dominant light - cone component of a meson momentum .",
    "the resummation of these double logarithms leads to a sudakov form factor @xmath21 $ ] , which suppresses the long distance contributions in the large @xmath15 region , and vanishes as @xmath22 .",
    "this form factor is given to sum the leading order soft gluon exchanges between the hard part and the wave functions of mesons .",
    "so this term includes the double infrared logarithms .",
    "the expression of @xmath23 is concretely given in appendix [ ap : formulashardpart ] .",
    "figure [ fig : sudakov ] shows that @xmath24 falls off quickly in the large @xmath15 , or long - distance , region , giving so - called sudakov suppression .",
    "this sudakov factor practically makes pqcd approach applicable . for the detailed derivation of the sudakov form factors ,",
    "see ref.@xcite .    with all the large logarithms resummed",
    ", the remaining finite contributions are absorbed into a perturbative b quark decay subamplitude @xmath25 .",
    "therefore the three scale factorization formula is given by the typical expression , @xmath26 , \\label{eq : factorization_formula}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 are the corresponding wilson coefficients , @xmath28 are the meson wave functions and the variable @xmath29 denotes the largest mass scale of hard process @xmath30 , that is , six - quark effective theory .",
    "the quark anomalous dimension @xmath31 describes the evolution from scale @xmath29 to @xmath18 .",
    "since logarithm corrections have been summed by renormalization group equations , the above factorization formula does not depend on the renormalization scale @xmath32 explicitly .",
    "the three scale factorization theorem in eq.([eq : factorization_formula ] ) is discussed by li _",

    "the wave function is defined as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is color s degree of freedom and @xmath36 is the distribution function of the 4-momenta of the light quark ( @xmath37 ) and @xmath15 quark ( @xmath38 ) @xmath39|b(p_b)\\rangle .",

    ", the condition @xmath44 is required .",
    "so @xmath45 is actually a function of @xmath37 only .",
    "through out this paper , we take @xmath46 , @xmath47 as the light - cone coordinates to write the four momentum .",
    "we consider the @xmath5 meson at rest , then that momentum is @xmath48 .",
    "the momentum of the light valence quark is written as ( @xmath49 ) , where the @xmath50 is a small transverse momentum .",
    "it is difficult to define the function @xmath51 .",
    "however , in the next section , we will see that the hard part is always independent of @xmath52 , if we make some approximations .",

    "the transverse momentum @xmath76 is usually conveniently converted to the @xmath15 parameter by fourier transformation .",
    "the initial conditions of @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath55 , are of nonperturbative origin , satisfying the normalization @xmath79 with @xmath80 the meson decay constants .",
    "with the above brief discussion , the only thing left is to compute @xmath30 for each diagram .",
    "there are altogether 8 diagrams contributing to the @xmath6 decays , which are shown in figure [ fig : diagrams ] .",
    "they are the lowest order diagrams .",
    "in fact the diagrams without hard gluon exchange between the spectator quark and other quarks are suppressed by the wave functions .",
    "the reason is that the light quark in @xmath5 meson is almost at rest .",
    "if there is no large momentum exchange with other quarks , it carries almost zero momentum in the fast moving @xmath55 , that is the end point of pion wave function . in the next section",
