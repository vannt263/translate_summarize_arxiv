    "in the nowadays context of global warming and habitat destruction , there is an enhanced general interest in the impact of environmental changes on biological populations evolution . despite this ,",
    "little has been done from a theoretical point of view , in the frame of evolutionary dynamics modeling , towards a _",
    "systematic _ approach of the role of various elements involved in these complex circumstances on the population dynamics . in a recent paper",
    "@xcite we investigated systematically the role of the selection pressure and mutation amplitude , as well as the impact of the quality and quantity of the habitat changes on the behavior of a single - species population .    for simplicity and in order to extract the generic features , we considered the case of a _ periodically changing environment _ , as in refs .",
    "the case of an abrupt change in the environment was also addressed .",
    "the mean - field level of description of the chosen model allowed us to put the finger , for the first time , on the very origin of the emerging complex behavior of this highly - nonlinear system , that is the delicate _ interplay between the different time - scale processes_. the role of the amplitude and period of the environmental changes on the critical value of the selection pressure ( corresponding to a phase - transition  extinct - alive \" of the population ) was clarified .",
    "however , the intrinsic stochasticity , the dynamically - built correlations between the individuals , and the role of the mutation - induced variety in population s evolution can not be appropriately accounted for at a mean - field level .",
    "a more refined level of description , which is an individual - based one , was therefore also considered .",
    "the main conclusions were that the inherent fluctuations do not destroy the phase transition  extinct - alive \" , and",
    "the mutation amplitude strongly influences the value of the critical selection pressure , giving rise , in particular , to a diversity - induced resonance phenomenon  @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram in the plane of the selection and mutation parameters was discussed as a function of the environmental variation characteristics . in particular , an important aspect well - known to experimental biologists , see e.g.  @xcite , was emerging naturally , namely that a small amount of randomness , due to mutations , is beneficial for population s survival in the changing environment , while a too large amount definitely is detrimental to it .",
    "the differences between a smooth variation of the environment and an abrupt , catastrophic change were also clarified , pointing to the beneficial role of the mutation in ensuring species survival after a catastrophe .    in this short paper",
    "we shall address another aspect of this survival problem , namely the role of the _ delay _ in the  reactions \" of the individuals .",
    "the lagged response to environmental changes is a phenomenon widespread in nature  @xcite .",
    "however , an extensive theoretical analysis of its impact on population dynamics is still lacking . the role and effects of time - delay in biologically systems has been addressed previously in the context of lotka - volterra type of dynamics of interacting species  @xcite , where the  delay \" was included at the level of the coupling between the species .",
    "here we are considering a different problem , namely the delayed - response of the individuals of a single - species population to a changing environment . using a simple model , we shall try to clarify the degree and limits of validity of the commonly - spred belief that  a population of fast - reacting individuals has better survival chances face to changes in their environment \" .",
    "we consider the same type of model as in ref .",
    "@xcite , namely a population of _ hermaphrodite _ individuals ( i.e. , which , although bisexual , need mating for reproduction ) , living on a two - dimensional square lattice of size @xmath0 . we assume that the individuals can not cross the borders of the lattice .",
    "moreover , the lattice has a _ finite carrying capacity _ , which comes from the exclusion assumption that there is at most one individual in each lattice node .",
    "the dynamics of the population takes place at discrete time - steps and is the result of : natural selection ( interaction with the environment ) , individual motion , mating and reproduction , as described below . + _",
    "a. natural selection .",
    "individual trait , time - dependent optimum , fitness , delayed - response , selection pressure , extinction probability .",
    "_ + each individual @xmath1 is characterized by its _ trait _ or _",
    "phenotype _ , which for simplicity is represented here through a real number @xmath2 [ 0,1 ] .",
    "the trait is fixed once and for all at the birth of the individual .    the population lives in an environment",
    "whose influence on the individuals is encoded in the value of the so - called _ optimum _ , @xmath3 $ ] , which we suppose to be homogeneous in space , but _ periodically variable in time _",
    "moreover , we consider here the simplest possibility , @xmath5 here @xmath6 denotes the amplitude of the environmental oscillation , with @xmath7 , @xmath8 is its period , and @xmath9 is the moment of onset of the optimum perturbation ; @xmath10 is the heaviside step function .",
    "the case of an abrupt change in the environment , for which the optimum jumps at @xmath11 from @xmath12 to @xmath13 was also considered .",
    "an individual @xmath1  reacts \" with a certain specific delay @xmath14 to the changes in the environment .",
    "this means that its instantaneous _ fitness _ ( or  adequacy to the environment \" , see below ) at time @xmath15 is determined by the value of the optimum at a previous time @xmath16 , @xmath17 the fitness determines the _ instantaneous individual extinction probability per time step @xmath18 _ , according to the following expression : @xmath19\\ , , \\label{surv}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is a parameter which models the _ selection pressure _ of the environment and constitutes a main control parameter of the system . during its life - time , and individual oscillates",
    "cyclically from being perfectly - adapted , when @xmath21 , i.e. , from a minimum possible extinction rate @xmath22 , to a worse adaptation , which corresponds to @xmath23 and to a larger instantaneous extinction probability , and finally to a total lack of adaptation , when @xmath24 .",
    "the pool of adapted individuals changes thus at each time step .",
    "the choice  ( [ surv ] ) we made of the extinction probability and the implicit definition of the selection pressure parameter @xmath20 are frequently encountered in the biological literature , see e.g.  @xcite . other choices and thus other ways of measuring the  selection pressure",
    "\" are of course possible .",
    "however , most of them can be mapped one onto the other and/or account for equivalent _ qualitative _ aspects of the interaction between the individuals and their environment .",
    "the _ individual delayed - response time @xmath14 _ is fixed once and for all at one individual s birth .",
    "we consider here a simple case when the @xmath14 s are random variables drawn from an uniform distribution within an interval @xmath25 $ ] .",
    "the upper limit of this interval @xmath26 represents another control parameter of the model .",
    "it is obvious that for a periodic variation of the environment only the values @xmath27 are relevant .",
    "note also that an equal delay - time for all individuals amounts simply to a change in the time - origin . as such ,",
    "a mean - field level description of the population dynamics ( which is already known as inappropriate for describing mutation , see  @xcite ) will not be able to account for the effects of the individual delay - times on the global evolution of the population .",
    "we shall therefore focus exclusively on the individual - based numerical simulations . + _ b. individual motion . _ + an individual can move to its surroundings , and the simplest possibility that we shall adopt hereafter is a random - walk .",
    "namely , in one time step the individual jumps on the lattice , from its initial location to a randomly chosen nearest - neighbor one ( i.e. , a site within the von neumann neighborhood of the initial node ) , provided that the chosen site is empty , and that it lies within the boundaries of the system .",
    "if none of the four first - neighbor nodes is empty , then the individual can not move , and thus can not mate ( see below ) .",

    "heredity and mutation . _ + suppose an individual @xmath1 reaches a destination node .",
    "if there are other individuals (  neighbors \" ) in the nearest - neighborhood of this destination site , then the individual ",
    "@xmath1 \" choses at random one of these neighbors , call it  @xmath28 \" , for mating .",
    "the pair of individuals @xmath1 and @xmath28 may then give birth to offsprings , which are placed at random on the empty nodes of the joint nearest - neighborhoods of the two parents ( that counts @xmath29 sites ) ; therefore , the maximum number of offsprings of one pair of parents equals @xmath29 . if there is no room in this neighborhood for putting an offspring , then this one is not born .",
    "the trait of a progeny @xmath30 coming from parents @xmath1 and @xmath28 is determined by the parents traits ( heredity ) , but it can also present some  variations \" due to different random factors , such as recombination , mutations , etc .",
    "we shall assume that @xmath31 where @xmath32 represents these variations .",
    "it brings diversification into the phenotypic pool of the population and we call it conventionally _ mutation_. for simplicity , we shall admit that @xmath32 is a random number , uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath33 $ ] , where @xmath34 is called hereafter the _ mutation amplitude _ and is a control parameter of the system   are often referred to as _ mutation rate_. however , because of the physical aspect @xmath35 designates , the term _ mutation amplitude _ looks more appropriate to us . ] .",
    "moreover , if eq .",
    "( [ zoff ] ) leads to @xmath36 or @xmath37 , then one  renormalizes \" it by resetting @xmath38 to @xmath39 , respectively @xmath40 , which means simply that the trait of the individuals can not overcome some fixed limits .",
    "this choice  ( [ zoff ] ) for the trait of an offspring is often made in the biological literature  @xcite .",
    "the population dynamics is thus driven by two main  forces \" that are acting , to some extent , in opposite directions : selection and mutation , characterized , respectively , through the values of the control parameters @xmath20 and @xmath35 .",
    "selection , combined with heredity , tries to bring the average trait close to the optimum , while mutation introduces diversity in the individual traits , and thus is broadening the distribution of the population s traits . +",
    "the monte - carlo simulation algorithm considers the individuals distributed on the lattice nodes , the initial condition being represented by their positions , the prescribed values of the individual traits and delay - times .",
    "the initial @xmath41 individuals are randomly - distributed with a mean concentration @xmath42 , and their individual traits are randomly assigned from an uniform distribution between @xmath40 and @xmath39 .",
    "the individuals are evolving , at discrete monte - carlo time steps ( mcs , defined hereafter ) , according to the stages _ a  c _ of the dynamics as described above , namely : + _ a. _ at a given time @xmath15 an individual @xmath1 is picked at random , and its extinction probability @xmath18 , corresponding to one mcs , is determined according to eqs .",

    "+ _ c. _ then it possibly mates and produces offsprings .",
    "+ if at the time @xmath15 there are @xmath46 individuals in the system , then the above steps _ a  c _ are repeated @xmath46 times ; this constitutes one mcs , the unit - time of the simulations . afterwards , the time is advanced by one step , @xmath47 , and the above algorithm is repeated .    as a last remark on the model",
    ", it is known on general backgrounds  @xcite that the system size is playing a certain role on the location of the phase transitin point , as well as on its  sharpness \" .",
    "we used for all our monte carlo simulations a system of @xmath48 lattice sites , for which we had shown previously , see ref .",
    "@xcite , that the qualitative features of the phase diagram are practically not affected by finite - size effects .",
    "for a periodic oscillation of the optimum we investigate the temporal evolution of a population starting from a given initial concentration @xmath49 .",
    "depending on the characteristic parameters , the population can evolve , on the average , either to an  alive phase \" , for which its concentration is actually oscillating periodically , with period @xmath50 , around a nonzero mean value , or can get extinct after a transient period of time . in our previous paper",

    "i.e. , the value of the control parameter @xmath26  affects the phase diagram extinct - alive of the system .",
    "we performed extensive simulations for various range of parameters and the main results are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] .",
    "one notices several interesting features exhibited by these figures : + a ) consider first the  intermediate \" values of @xmath8 for which , as described in ref .",
    "@xcite for the no - delay case , one encounters the diversity - induced resonance phenomenon , i.e. , the  peak \" in the phase - diagram illustrated in the upper and middle panels of fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] . then : + ( i ) for small values of the mutation amplitude @xmath35 , the existence of a delay in the response of the individuals to environmental changes ( i.e. , @xmath59 ) is _ increasing the survival chances _ of the population .",
    "the diversity related to the randomness in the response of the individuals can contribute to the appearance of a larger pool of well - adapted individuals and is thus formally equivalent to an increase in the  effective \" mutation amplitude , which is beneficial for the survival  @xcite .",
    "+ ( ii ) for large values of @xmath35 , however , adding the randomness of the delayed - response to the mutation - related one is leading to an even higher  effective \" mutation amplitude .",
    "as such , the extinction risk of the population is increased : as seen in the plots , the phase diagram for the populations with delayed - response ( @xmath60 ) lies always below the one of the instantaneously - reacting population ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "+ ( iii ) finally , the peak related to the mutation - induced diversity is generally still present for the systems with time delay .",
    "however , in this case the randomness in the delayed - response can turn a part of the pool of well - adapted individuals into less - adapted ones , and thus the height of the peak is reduced as compared to the case of an instantaneously - adapting population . for large delays ( like @xmath62 in the figures ) this peak can be even suppressed .",
    "+ b ) one concludes therefore that the role of the delay - induced diversity is an increase in the  effective \" mutation amplitude . as such",
    ", it can be easily predicted that for small values of @xmath8 ( rapid oscillations of the environment ) the dynamics of the system will be only slightly affected by the delay , since it is already only slightly sensitive to changes in @xmath35 .",
    "this is illustrated in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] .",
    "no diversity - induced peak , i.e. , no optimal  effective \" mutation amplitude is encountered in these cases , any mutation and any delay in response being harmful for the surviving of the population . + a way to get a better insight into the reasons for this behavior is the monitoring of the temporal evolution of the pool of fittest individuals ( i.e. , the individuals with @xmath63 ) .",
    "figure  [ figure2 ] illustrates this point , for a fixed value of @xmath8 and three values of @xmath59 , coresponding to the middle panel of fig .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    one can see that for the surviving populations the number @xmath67 of the instantaneously fittest individuals is oscillating periodically in time ( but never reaching zero ) , while it decays ( with oscillations ) to zero for the populations that will get extinct .",

    "[ figure2 ] ) and , on the contrary , it is depleted by the delayed - response in populations with intermediate and large mutation amplitude ( lower panel of fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] ) .",
    "finally , we addressed also the effects of a delayed answer in the case of a catastrophic , abrupt change in the environment .",
    "as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] , one encounters the same type of phenomena as in the case of a smooth variation of the optimum , namely the fact that for small mutation rate the largest the delay parameter @xmath26 , the bigger the survival chances of the population .     and mutation amplitude @xmath51 , for an abrupt jump in the value of the optimum , from @xmath12 to @xmath68 , for different values of the delay time @xmath26 .",
