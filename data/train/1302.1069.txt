    "the lhc era has started off with a bang : not only have the experiments decisively rediscovered all of the familiar particles of the standard model , confirming that the operations of the acclerator and detectors are well understood , but both atlas @xcite and cms @xcite have also found a new scalar particle that closely resembles the long - awaited higgs boson .",
    "since the standard model with one higgs doublet is not natural up to arbitrarily high energies , and since it leaves many questions ( including the origin of flavor ) unanswered , we anticipate that some physics beyond the standard model remains to be discovered .",
    "an intriguing possibility is that an extended color gauge sector may exist . in particular , new colored states beyond the familiar quarks and gluons",
    "could be awaiting discovery at the lhc .",
    "these could reflect a variety of kinds of theories beyond the standard model .",
    "one class of theories are those in which the strong interactions are extended from the standard @xmath0 to a larger @xmath1 group and in which spontaneous symmetry breaking reduces the larger group to its diagonal subgroup which is identified with @xmath0 .",
    "these models include topcolor @xcite , the flavor - universal topcolor @xcite , classic chiral color @xcite , chiral color with unequal gauge couplings @xcite and a newer flavor non - universal chiral color model @xcite .",
    "each of these models includes new heavy colored gauge bosons ( colorons , topgluons , or axigluons ) transforming as a color octet .",
    "other theories with new color octet states include theories of new extra spacetime dimensions that incorporate kaluza - klein partners for the gluons , as in refs .",

    "an entire catalog of possible new colored states including color sextet fermions , colored scalars , and low - scale string resonances @xcite has also been reviewed in @xcite .",
    "if an extended color gauge sector does exist , then there are indications that it could be likely to couple more strongly to the third generation than the light quarks . for instance , if the new scalar state with a mass of 125 gev is actually a composite , rather than a fundamental , scalar , it could potentially be a bound state of top quarks@xcite@xcite@xcite @xcite@xcite , as realized in topcolor @xcite , topcolor - assisted technicolor @xcite and top seesaw @xcite@xcite@xcite models , and as analyzed phenomenologically in @xcite@xcite .",
    "there is also the puzzling question of how to explain the forward - backward asymmetry observed by the tevatron experiments @xcite@xcite in the production of top - quark pairs .",
    "models involving flavor non - universal axigluons @xcite have been cited as a possible explanation , and there has been discussion in the literature @xcite@xcite of the degree to which the properties of those axigluons would be constrained by data on flavor - changing neutral currents .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce a model in which the strong interactions are extended to an @xmath1 structure in a way that causes the new heavy coloron states to couple differently to the third generation quarks than to the lighter generations .",
    "what is novel about this model is that it also naturally addresses the experimental observation that the third family of quarks has only a small mixing with the lighter families .",
    "this is implemented through the presence of heavy weak - vector quarks that transform in the same way under the extended color group as the third - generation quarks .",
    "mixing between the ordinary quark generations occurs only because all three generations mix with the vector quarks ; the different gauge charges of the third and lighter generations of quarks thus lead to naturally small mixing between those generations .",
    "effectively , this model is a nice realization of next - to - minimal flavor violation @xcite .    in the next section",
    ", we will introduce the gauge and fermion sectors of the model , discuss the flavor symmetries , and demonstrate that the model naturally reproduces the ckm structure of quark masses and mixings . in section 3 ,",
    "we study how data on flavor - changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) constrains the model parameters and find that clear regions remain allowed .",
    "section 4 shows how the lhc experiments searches for new resonances decaying to dijets bound the properties of the colorons in our model ; section 5 , likewise , shows how lhc searches for new heavy colored fermions restrict the characteristics of the heavy vector quarks in our model .",
    "finally , in section 6 , we summarize our conclusions and findings .",
    "we will now introduce the model in more detail .",
    "first , we discuss the gauge boson , scalar , and fermion content",
    ". then we detail the dirac and yukawa interaction terms and the flavor symmetries that yield the diverse masses of the nearly - standard fermion states .",
