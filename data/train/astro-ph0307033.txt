    "later , @xcite and @xcite argued that dla kinematics are consistent with those expected from lines of sight intercepting massive rotating thick gaseous disks .",
    "however , theoretical simulations of galaxy formation show that a large range of structures and morphologies can give rise to dlas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "dlas would arise from the combined effect of a massive central galaxy and/or a number of smaller satellites in a virialized halo @xcite or filaments ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "several approaches have been used to investigate the nature of high@xmath27 dlas .",
    "broad band imaging surveys of dlas have been used since @xcite ; @xcite were unsuccessful in finding the absorber , but did find large numbers of lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , it has become clear that dlas ( 1 ) show little evolution from @xmath28 to @xmath29 in their contribution to the matter density of the universe @xmath30 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * and references therein ) ; ( 2 ) show little metallicity evolution @xcite from @xmath31 to @xmath32 ; ( 3 ) have heterogeneous chemical properties @xcite ; ( 4 ) have various morphologies @xcite ; and ( 5 ) have low star formation rates @xcite .",
    "these results indicate that dlas do not participate significantly in the overall chemical enrichment of the universe and hence do not trace star formation in any straightforward way .",
    "both these observations and theoretical work show that dlas are not a single type of galaxy , but are merely characteristic of a type of region : namely , one with a large neutral column density ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    similarly to broad - band imaging , early attempts to detect diffuse  emission from dlas at @xmath33 using deep narrow band imaging ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) did not reveal the absorber , but unveiled a few companion  emitters , hinting at the clustering of galaxies around dlas .",
    "this prompted @xcite to calculate the two - point correlation function at @xmath34 and to conclude that indeed  emitters are clustered near dlas .",

    "* ) .    here",
    ", we seek to constrain the matter distribution around dlas at @xmath13 using lbgs as tracers of the large scale structure . specifically , are the dlas in _ over- or under - dense _ regions ?",
    "previous attempts at answering this question include the investigation of @xcite , which ruled out any clustering between galaxies and a dla at @xmath35 .",
    "recently , @xcite found only two galaxies within 265(@xmath36  mpc ) and within @xmath37 ( @xmath38  mpc ) of four dlas at @xmath13 whereas 5.96 were expected .",
    "they conclude from the same null hypothesis test used here ( see below ) that the lack of galaxies near the four dlas is significant at @xmath39%  level and argue that this is evidence that dlas and lbgs do not reside in the same parts of the universe.    in contrast , @xcite reported the discovery of super - clustering of sub - dlas at @xmath40 .",
    "recent narrow - band imaging ( fynbo et al . 2003 , private communication ) of the same field shows that spectroscopically confirmed -emitting galaxies are clustered at the redshift of the two strongest   clouds . these observations and others ( e.g. * ?",

    "estimating @xmath121 accurately would require a large number of dlas .",

    "the errors include the shot noise and the contribution of the clustering of the galaxies .",

    "next , in order to assess the significance of our result , we examined the two limiting situations presented and some possible sources of contamination .    in the first case ,",
    "where we assume the lbg - dla cross - correlation is the same as the lbg auto - correlation , i.e. @xmath134 , we test whether this excess of galaxies around the absorber could be caused by the lbg clustering . a qualitative way to answer this is given by the dotted line in fig  [ fig : clustering ] , which shows the expected number of galaxies around the dla due to the clustering of lbgs .",

    "e.g. , within @xmath140  mpc , we find 7  galaxies while 2.70  were expected .",
    "could  and be drawn from the same poisson distribution of true mean ?",
    "the answer is given by testing the null hypothesis ``  and  are drawn from the same poisson distribution '' versus ``  is greater than '' , i.e. the observed overdensity is statistically significant . at @xmath141  mpc , we find there is a probability of finding n@xmath142 galaxies ( under the null hypothesis with @xmath143 ) of @xmath144% ( @xmath145p - value shown in table  [ table : stat ] ) .",
    "this implies the null hypothesis ought to be rejected , and the observed number of galaxies is _ larger than _ what one would expect from the lbg auto - correlation at the @xmath146%  significance level .    in the second limiting case @xmath147",
    ", we test whether a purely random fluctuation in @xmath148 could cause our result .",
    "this would decrease the expected number of galaxies slightly and therefore increase the significance level ( see table  [ table : stat ] ) .",
    "our results are not sensitive to the background density .",
    "the background density , itself , is a strong function of the magnitude limit and of the redshift slice width .",
    "a change of the background density @xmath149 will change significantly both the observed and expected number of galaxies throughout the field .",
    "however , both are affected in the same way from eq .",
    "[ crosseq ] by @xmath149 .",
    "the effect on the overdensity cancels out , since the overdensity is the excess of observed to the expected number of galaxies .",
    "the same relative overdensity by a factor of @xmath150 is observed with different magnitude cuts from 24 to 24.5 , and with a width half or twice our current redshift width .",
    "alternative causes for the apparent excess of galaxies include contamination from low redshift sources ( stars or galaxies ) and signal from the cross - correlation between lbgs and other quasar absorption line clouds besides the dla .",
    "we estimate our contamination from low - redshift galaxies to be @xmath151 10% at @xmath105 based on our photometric redshift analysis in the hdf @xcite .",
    "another source of contamination is from faint stars with color similar to those of our lbg candidates . to estimate the stellar contamination",
    ", we used our star counts up to @xmath152 and extrapolate them to our magnitude limit , assuming the counts to be constant at @xmath153 .",

    "in addition , we search for all objects within 45(285  kpc physical ) and find an lbg candidate with @xmath22 at @xmath159  kpc , with a luminosity of @xmath24 . due to the large impact parameter , this galaxy is unlikely to be responsible for the dla , although it may be associated with it .",

    "<S> we present results on the clustering of lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) around a probable damped  absorption ( dla ) line cloud at @xmath0 from deep @xmath1 images of the field containing the quasar apm 08279 + 5255 ( @xmath2 ) . the large area covered by our images , 0.31 @xmath3 or @xmath4  mpc co - moving at redshift @xmath5 , and their depth , @xmath6  mag  arcsec@xmath7 , allow us to identify @xmath8 lbg candidates brighter than @xmath9 at @xmath10 both close ( 50  kpc ) to the dla line - of - sight and up to 20 mpc ( co - moving ) from the dla , i.e. physically unrelated . </S>",
    "<S> lbg candidates were identified using photometric redshift techniques that include the @xmath11 magnitude as a prior estimate in addition to the colors . </S>",
    "<S> the two are combined using bayes theorem . </S>",
    "<S> this helps to break the degenerancies that occur in a pure spectral template fitting scheme . </S>",
    "<S> the overall rms is @xmath12 at @xmath13 based on our analysis of photometric redshifts in the hdf - n .    from the redshift </S>",
    "<S> likelihood distributions , we selected lbg galaxies within a redshift slice of width @xmath14 centered on the redshift of the dla @xmath15 .    within that redshift slice , we find an enhancement of galaxies near the dla using both the surface density ( @xmath16 ) and an estimator of the 3-d spatial overdensity ( @xmath17 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the surface overdensity @xmath18 is significant at the @xmath19%  significance level on scales @xmath20  mpc co - moving . </S>",
    "<S> the overdensity can not be related to the qso environment since the qso is at @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> these results imply that some dla could reside in high density regions .    </S>",
    "<S> we search within 45  from the line of sight for galaxies responsible for the dla , and find one candidate with @xmath22 that is 26  ( 145  kpc physical ) away . from its magnitude @xmath23 </S>",
    "<S> , its luminosity is @xmath24 . due to its large impact parameter , </S>",
    "<S> however , this galaxy is not a likely candidate for the absorber . </S>"
