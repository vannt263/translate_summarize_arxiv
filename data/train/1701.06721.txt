    "herbig aebe ( haebe ) stars are a or b - type , pre - main sequence stars that show optical emission lines , particularly the hydrogen balmer lines , in their spectra and an infrared ( ir ) excess in their spectral energy distributions ( seds ) ; both can be attributed to the presence of circumstellar dust and gas  @xcite .",
    "haebe systems inherit a large amount of angular momentum from the star formation phase , leading the dust and gas to settle into an equatorial disk .",
    "haebe disks have been the subject of many studies at variety of wavelengths due to their role in star and protoplanetary disk formation ( e.g.  @xcite ) . as the disks around haebe stars are likely sites of planet formation ( e.g.  @xcite ) , they are of great interest in understanding fundamental disk and planet formation physics .",
    "haebe stars are the higher mass counterparts to the t tauri stars , which show balmer emission lines in their spectra and an excess in their infrared seds , interpreted as radiation from gas and dust in the form of a circumstellar disk . ] and represent an important link between the formation of low - mass and high - mass stars .",
    "the disks of haebe stars can be divided into an inner gaseous disk and an outer dusty disk . due to the high effective temperatures of a and b stars",
    ", dust is expected to evaporate near the star .",
    "the dust - free , inner gaseous region can be further divided into an inner region of atomic gas and a more distant disk of molecular gas .",
    "emission lines in the optical and near - ir are generally used to study the atomic gas , while near - ir molecular emission lines are used to study the outer molecular gas . as the disk temperature decreases with distance from the star , beyond a certain distance dust is stable and settles into a disk , along with the cool gas .",
    "this cool , outer region can also be studied using millimeter and sub - millimeter interferometry ( see the review by  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "several studies using co overtone emission and millimeter interferometric observation have shown that the gas in these dusty , cool regions follows keplerian rotation @xcite .",
    "there are various differences amongst the haebe stars , as well as between haebe stars and t  tauri stars .",
    "while t  tauri stars are believed to accrete magnetospherically ( see @xcite and @xcite for reviews ) , there is little direct observational evidence of accretion amongst the early - type hbe stars .",
    "furthermore , if accretion is occurring , it is not clear if the accretion is controlled by large scale magnetic field @xcite .",
    "several studies , such as those of  @xcite ,  @xcite , and  @xcite , have noted differences in the polarization of herbig stars : cooler hae stars show intrinsic h@xmath0 line polarization , while the hotter hbe stars show line depolarization attributable to dilution by disk h@xmath0 emission .",
    "the authors suggest that this difference reflects different underlying types of accretion , in that linear polarization indicates magnetospheric accretion , while depolarization may be explained by disk accretion .",
    "recent studies have noted additional differences between hae and hbe stars in the lines of h@xmath0 , h@xmath1 , br@xmath7 , hei  @xmath8 , hei  @xmath9 , feii  @xmath10 , and [ oi]@xmath11 , again suggesting different accretion modes @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied the uv balmer excess of the haebe stars and showed that magnetospheric models seem unable to reproduce the excess for early - type hbe stars .",
    "all of these lines of evidence suggest that an alternative to magnetospheric accretion may be required for the hbe stars and that studying the region close the stellar surface , i.e. the inner gaseous disk , offers a way to shed some light on the mechanism of how and when material from the disk accretes onto hbe stars .",
    "another class of early - type emission - line stars are the classical be stars .",
    "classical be stars are b - type , main - sequence stars that show , or have once shown , one or more balmer emission lines in their spectrum ; they can also display modest amounts of emission in metal lines and and posses an ir excess .",
    "however , the ir excess is not attributable to dust but rather to free - free emission from an ionized gas in a circumstellar decretion disk  @xcite .",
    "suggestive similarities exist between hbe stars and the classical be stars in observed features such as polarization level , photometric variability , ir excesses ( which can be small for some hbe stars ) , and h@xmath0 emission line equivalent width ( ew hereafter ) distribution @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xcite noted that group iii  hbe stars , those with very small ir excesses , closely resemble ( and are sometimes confused with ! ) the classical be stars .",
    "these similarities are likely due to the underlying similarity in the gaseous , circumstellar disks themselves , in spite of the obvious difference of origin ( i.e.  accretion versus decretion ) .",
    "this similarity suggests that using computational methods that have been successfully applied to the disks of the classical be stars may help to better understand and model the physical conditions in the inner gaseous disks of the hbe stars . in this work ,",
    "we focus on early - type hbe stars as important differences exist between hae and hbe stars ( as stated above ) , including difficulties in applying magnetospheric accretion models to the early - type hbe stars .",
    "the computational modelling tools specifically made for classical be stars have been very successful in reproducing the observed data ( spectra , seds , interferometric visibilities ) , as well as providing a general understanding of the density and temperature structure of classical be star disks @xcite .    to study the inner gaseous disk of hbe stars , optical and near - ir emission lines are key diagnostics .",
    "such lines trace not only the structure of the disk ( its temperature , density , and velocity field ) but also the processes taking place in this region .",
    "the strongest emission lines found in the spectra of hbe stars are the hydrogen balmer lines h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 .",
    "several other emission lines , such as the caii ir triplet and lines of feii and oi , are of moderate strength and appear in emission in the spectrum .",
    "h@xmath0 , caii and feii lines have been previously used as indicators of wind and chromospheric activity @xcite .",
    "in contrast , other studies suggest that emission lines such as h@xmath0 and the caii ir triplet are non - photospheric in origin and form in a region at some distance from the stellar surface @xcite .",
    "previous studies have utilized hydrogen br@xmath7 spectro - interferometry for several haebe stars with many different types of models , such as magnetospheric models , outflows , and/or keplerian disks ( see  @xcite and reference within ) . for h@xmath0 , three hae stars , namely ab aur , hd 172981 , and hd 141529  @xcite , and one hbe star , mwc 361 ( or hd 200775 )  @xcite ,",
    "have also been studied using spectro - interferometry .    in this paper ,",
    "we attempt to fit the spectral line profiles of three hbe stars using a circumstellar disk model in which no significant accretion is currently occurring and the disk radiates because it is heated and photoionized by the radiation from the star .",
    "this is the second paper in our series investigating inner gaseous disks around early - type hbe stars .",
    "@xcite , paper  i hereafter , modelled optical emission lines of the hb2e star bd+651637 by comparing them to synthetic line profiles computed with the bedisk and beray non - lte circumstellar disk codes @xcite .",
    "acceptable matches to the strengths and shapes of all emission lines considered were found based on a geometrically thin disk with a simple , single power - law parametrization of its density structure .",
    "no additional heating of the disk was required beyond the photoionization energy input of the central star .",
    "gas densities of @xmath12 were required in the disk near the star , with the disk extending to @xmath13 stellar radii .",
    "however , distinct regions in the disk density parameter space were required to fit the hydrogen and metal lines , leading to the conclusion that the metal lines ( caii and feii ) require a slower density drop - off in the equatorial plane of the disk compared to the hydrogen balmer lines .    in this current paper , three additional hb2e stars and their inner gaseous disks are investigated using the same numerical codes .",
    "section  [ sec : stars ] provides background information on the three stars , discusses their fundamental parameters , and outlines the observations and data reduction procedures .",
    "modeling of the line profiles is discussed in section  [ sec : modeling ] .",
    "the results are discussed in sections  [ sec : results ] through [ sec : bd65 ] , and the paper concludes with key findings in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "three hbe stars of spectral type b2 are considered in this study : hd76534 , hd114981 and hd216629 .",
    "the fundamental stellar parameters are adopted from  @xcite and are given in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "@xcite derived the effective temperatures by matching synthetic spectra generated by the ` tlusty ` and ` synspec ` codes @xcite to the observed spectra .",
    "the synthetic spectra were generated assuming @xmath14 for all stars .",
    "the synthetic spectra were rotationally broadened and used to determine the @xmath15 of the stars . using the stellar luminosities and effective temperatures ,",
    "the stars were placed in the hr diagram and compared to evolutionary tracks calculated using the cesam stellar evolutionary code , version 2k  @xcite , to determine the masses and radii .",
    "hd76534 a ( v *  ou  vel ) is a hbe star of spectral type b2e with a visual magnitude of 8.35 located at a distance of 870  pc .",
    "it is a member of the vela r2 association and illuminates the surrounding reflection nebula vdb 24  @xcite .",
    "this star is the brighter member of a visual binary .",
    "hd76534 was first classified as a hbe star by  @xcite , and its small infrared excess led it to be classified as group iii by @xcite ; group  iii hbe stars have small infrared excesses , similar to the classical be stars .",
    "large variations in the equivalent width ( ew ) of h@xmath0 , ranging from -14.3     to + 2.4   , have been reported @xcite .",
    "large scale variations are also seen in the observed polarization of hd76534 over time scales of @xmath161 month  @xcite .",
    "hd114981 ( v * v958 cen ) is a 7.16 visual magnitude star at a distance of 550  pc  @xcite .",
    "it is a b - type star that shows a small ir excess and has been suggested to be a classical be star .",
    "@xcite classified hd114981 as a b - type star with ir excess typical of vega - like stars .",
    "@xcite and @xcite classified hd114981 as haebe candidate with spectral type b5 due to h@xmath0 emission ; however  @xcite re - classified it as type b2 .",
    "@xcite estimated that hd114981 is young with an age of @xmath17 myr .",
    "using the recent analysis , and the evidence presented in the analysis ( especially it s young age ) , hd114981 will be treated as a hb2e star .",
    "hd216629 ( v * il cep ) is a b2e star of visual magnitude 9.31 located at a distance of 720  pc @xcite .",
    "several studies , such as @xcite and @xcite , have associated hd216629 with the cep ob3 association ; however , @xcite argue against this based on the position of hd216629 in the h - r diagram .",
    "@xcite studied hd216629 with spectro - astrometry and found that it is a wide , double - lined , spectroscopic binary . @xcite also noted variation in hei lines from one observation to another and indicated that the binary companion might be causing the variations .",
    "double - peaked h@xmath0 emission has been observed with the ew ranging from -34.5    to + 4.5    @xcite .",
    "the ew of h@xmath1 has been reported to be + 3.4    @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied the balmer emission lines of hd216629 and failed to detect any depolarization .",
    "because of its binary nature , @xcite do not assign a mass or radius ; therefore , we have adopted average b2 values given by @xcite .",
    "the current observational data were obtained with the high - resolution espadons spectropolarimeter on the canadian - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) .",
    "this instrument covers the wavelength range 3700 to 10500    with a spectral resolution of 65,000 .",
    "the hd76534 spectrum , obtained in 2005 ( hjd2453423 ) , can be seen in figure  [ fig : hd76534_spec ] .",
    "the peak snr per pixel is 221 at 7080   .",
    "the spectrum contains not only a strong h@xmath0 emission line but also weaker emission from h@xmath1 and , possibly , from the caii ir triplet .",
    "weak emission from several feii multiplets , common in the optical spectra of hbe stars , is also detected .",
    "the ews of all the measured line profiles can be found in table  [ table2 ] .        for hd114981 ,",
    "two different spectra are available , one from 2005 ( hjd2453422 ) with a peak snr per pixel of 329 at 5150   , and one from 2006 ( hjd2453748 ) with a peak snr per pixel of 633 at 5150   .",
    "it is the 2006 spectrum that is shown in in figure  [ fig : hd114981_spec ] .",
    "again , emission lines of h@xmath0 , h@xmath1 , possibly caii , and feii are detected .",
    "a comparison of the two spectra , taken approximately a year apart , can be seen in figure  [ fig : hd114981_compare ] , and only small changes are seen .",
    "the h@xmath0 emission is a bit stronger in the 2006 observations , and the h@xmath1 line has shallower wings in the 2005 observations . for the feii lines , the 2005 profiles are slightly stronger .",
    "all emission lines show symmetric , doubly - peaked profiles .",
    "hei @xmath186678 is seen in absorption in both spectra and has a very broad profile . as the 2006 spectrum has a higher snr ,",
    "we have chosen it for analysis .",
    "the ews of the 2006 line profiles for hd114981 can be found in table  [ table2 ] .",
    "the spectrum for hd216629 was obtained in 2006 ( hjd2454077 ) at peak snr per pixel of 227 at 7080    and can be seen in figure  [ fig : hd216629_spec ] .",
    "it shows prominent h@xmath0 , h@xmath1 , and caii ir triplet emission lines .",
    "two feii lines , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , are also present weakly in emission .",
    "h@xmath0 is singly - peaked , while h@xmath1 , the caii ir triplet , and the feii lines are doubly - peaked . h@xmath1 and",
    "the feii lines show a stronger red ( r ) component in their doubly - peaked profile compared to the blue ( v ) component .",
    "the ews of all the line profiles for hd216629 can also be found in table  [ table2 ] .    for hd76534 and hd216629 ,",
    "previous observations have suggested variability @xcite ; the ew of h@xmath0 has ranged from -14.3 to + 2.4 for hd76534 and from -34.5 to + 4.5 for hd216629 . in the current espadons spectra ,",
    "the h@xmath0 ew for hd76534 is -10.9and for hd216629 , -19.7  ; therefore , the current data set for hd7634 was obtained when the star was in relatively bright phase , while hd216629 was in a more typical phase of its overall variability .",
    "the spectra for all three stars were continuum normalized using iraf in order to be able to compare the observed line profiles to the synthetic spectra .",
    "the individual orders containing the emission lines of interest were separately normalized using various low order ( 2@xmath21 or 3@xmath22 ) polynomials , with either the ` legendre ' or ` cubic spline ' functions available in iraf .",
    "the three caii ir triplet lines ( @xmath188498 , @xmath188542 , @xmath188662 ) are blended with various high - n paschen lines that needed to be subtracted from the composite profiles in order to extract the unblended caii line profiles for analysis . in order to remove the contaminating paschen emission ,",
    "the two adjacent , unblended paschen lines were averaged , and this average was subtracted from the composite line profile .",
    "for example , to deblend caii @xmath188542 from pa15 @xmath188543 , the average profile of pa14 @xmath188596 and pa17 @xmath188465 was subtracted from the composite line .",
    "this procedure was performed for all the three caii ir triplets lines for the three stars .",
    "an example of the subtraction process , and the result for all three stars , can be seen in figure  [ fig : caiisubtraction_c4 ] for the caii @xmath188542 emission line .",
    "the subtraction process did not yield a significant caii line profile compared to the continuum noise for two of the three stars , hd76534 and hd114981 . therefore , caii was not considered in the analysis of these stars .",
    "the caii line profile for hd216629 , however , shows a strong , doubly - peaked line profile after subtraction , and this profile was retained in the subsequent analysis .",
    "to compute the synthetic line profiles used to model the observed emission lines , the non - lte radiative transfer codes bedisk @xcite and beray @xcite , were used .",
    "these codes assume an equatorial , non - accreting , gaseous disk in keplerian rotation surrounding the central star .",
    "the photoionizing stellar radiation field is the sole source of input energy , and the temperature distribution in the disk is found by enforcing radiative equilibrium .",
    "the disk is assumed to be axisymmetric about the star s rotation axis and the disk mid - plane .    given a user - supplied disk density structure , bedisk computes the thermal structure of the disk by enforcing of radiative equilibrium in the gas assumed of solar composition at a large number of grid points in the disk , the net rates of heating and cooling due to nine abundant elements ( h , he , c , n , o , mg , si , ca and fe ) over many ionization stages are balanced to determine the radiative equilibrium temperatures .",
    "in addition to the temperature structure of the disk , bedisk calculates all of the atomic level populations required to compute the gas emissivity and opacity required for radiative transfer .",
    "the atomic level populations are found by solving the equations of statistical equilibrium ( for more details , see @xcite ) .",
    "line profiles , spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , and monochromatic images on the sky can be calculated using the beray code @xcite which solves the equation of radiative transfer along a series of rays ( @xmath23 ) that pass through the star+disk system directed at the observer .",
    "the disk thermal structure and level populations computed by bedisk are used for the radiative transfer calculations .",
    "no incident radiation is assumed for the rays that pass through the disk . for rays that terminate on the stellar surface , an appropriate doppler - shifted , photospheric",
    ", lte line profile was used for the boundary condition .",
    "thus , the synthetic line profiles produced by beray include contributions from both the stellar photosphere and the disk in a consistent way , and the resulting synthetic line profiles , normalized to the predicted continuum , can directly be compared with the observations .",
    "the assumed density structure for the disk was set by two free parameters , a base density @xmath24 and a power law index @xmath25 , in the equation @xmath26 here @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the cylindrical co - ordinates for the disk , @xmath29 is the stellar radius , and @xmath30 is the disk scale height .",
    "the disk is assumed to start at the stellar photosphere ( @xmath31 ) and extend out to a radius of r@xmath32 .",
    "the disk was assumed to be in vertical , hydrostatic equilibrium , and in this case , the scale height in equation  ( [ eq : rho ] ) has the form @xmath33 + where @xmath34 + here , @xmath35 is the stellar mass , @xmath36 is an assumed , hydrostatic equilibrium temperature used _ solely _ to fix the vertical structure of the disk , , but this self - consistent treatment does not lead to large changes in the predicted emission line profiles @xcite . ] and @xmath37 is the mean molecular weight of the gas , taken to be 0.68 .",
    "the typical value of @xmath36 in classical be stars is @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "a thin disk ( @xmath39 ) is natural consequence of the assumption of vertical hydrostatic equilibrium and the typical radiative equilibrium temperatures found in the disk .",
    "however by varying the value of @xmath36 , the scale height of the disk can be changed and thicker disks can be produced . since it is unclear how thick or thin the disks of hbe stars are , both _ thin disk models _",
    ", achieved by setting the @xmath36 to @xmath40 , and _ thick disk models _ , achieved by setting @xmath36 to @xmath41 , were considered .",
    "in addition to these two basic disk density models ( thick or thin ) , there is an additional parameter for the adopted disk microturbulence , @xmath42 .",
    "the value of microturbulence is set either to zero or the local sound speed in the disk , giving sonic turbulence in the latter case .",
    "the models with the microturbulence set to the local sound speed will be referred to as _ turbulent disk models_.    when calculating the synthetic line profiles , an additional model parameter is added to the list : the viewing inclination ( @xmath43 ) of the disk , defined such that @xmath44 represents a pole - on star / face - on disk .",
    "thus , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , r@xmath32 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 are all of the input parameters to be varied for the synthetic line profile calculations .",
    "the parameters defining the central b2v star , m@xmath3 , r@xmath3 , t@xmath45 , are assumed fixed .",
    "the bedisk and beray codes were specifically developed for the gaseous decretion disks of classical be stars .",
    "many studies ( see  @xcite ) have successfully used the bedisk and beray codes to model be star gaseous disks by matching observables , such as the hydrogen balmer lines , feii lines , ir line fluxes , seds , and optical and near - ir interferometric visibilities . given the apparent similarities between hbe and classical be stars , these computational codes provide a good starting point towards understanding the inner , gaseous disks around hbe stars using the spectral line profile modelling . in the previous work of paper  i , the spectrum of the hbe star bd+651637 was successfully modelled using the bedisk and beray codes .    to model the observed line profiles of the three hbe stars considered in this work",
    ", a large grid of synthetic line profiles for disks surrounding a central b2 star were calculated using the parameters given in the table  [ tab : star_param ] .",
    "the adopted b2 parameters fall within the uncertainty of the stellar parameters given in table  [ table1 ] for all stars . a wide variety of disk parameters , listed in table  [ tab : model_param ] , were explored .",
    "typical values of @xmath46 and @xmath25 for classical be stars fall in the range of @xmath47 to @xmath48 and 2 to 4 , respectively  @xcite . however , for hbe stars , an expanded range of model parameters was considered in order to include more massive disks by calculating higher @xmath46 and/or lower @xmath25 .",
    "thus , the models were calculated with the base density parameter , @xmath24 , ranging from @xmath49 to @xmath50 , and the power - law index , @xmath25 , ranging from @xmath51 to @xmath52 .",
    "the size of the disk was chosen to be one of three values , r@xmath32=@xmath53 , @xmath54 or @xmath55r@xmath3 , corresponding to @xmath4 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57  au , respectively .",
    "all the synthetic line profiles were calculated at four viewing inclinations , which represent the centers of the first four bins of five equal probability bins in a random @xmath58 distribution : 18@xmath59 , 45@xmath59 , 60@xmath59 and 75@xmath59 .",
    "the fifth bin , @xmath60 , was not considered as there is no evidence of shell absorption , i.e.  deep central reversals in the line profiles caused by disk absorption , in any of the spectra .    to compare each synthetic profile in the computed library to an observed line profile , a figure - of - merit , @xmath61 , was computed .",
    "this figure - of - merit was defined as @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the observed relative ( continuum normalized ) flux , @xmath64 is the model relative flux , and the sum is over the @xmath65 wavelength points spanning the line .",
    "a range of small shifts to the observed wavelength scale were also considered , within the errors of the star s radial velocity , in order to best match the observed profile .",
    "the smallest value of @xmath61 was deemed to define the best - fit model for that feature , although the ten profiles with smallest @xmath61 values were visually inspected in order to verify a best match . in cases of asymmetric line profiles ,",
    "i.e.   v / r ( violet to red peak ) ratios other than 1 ( such as h@xmath1 for hd216629 ) , the match was made to only one of the peaks , depending on the shape , strength and width of the line profile .",
    "we will first discuss the best - fit models for each individual line of table  [ table2 ] for each of the three stars . as will be shown",
    ", it is often the case that the best set of model parameters @xmath66 will differ between the various lines of the same star . to address this",
    ", we consider global fits , that is how well a disk density model based on a single set of these parameters can reproduce the entire emission line spectrum of each star , in section  [ sec : globalfits_c4 ] , and section  [ sec : uniquenessoffits ] discusses the uniqueness of the results .",
    "disk density parameters for all of the individual and global fits for all three stars are summarized in table  [ tab : bestfitmodels_c4 ] .",
    "hei ( @xmath67 ) is a photospheric line and is not used to constrain the disk models except for hd216629 ( see section  [ sec : linefits_216629 ] for more details . )",
    "the best - fit , synthetic line profiles to the individual observed emission lines for hd76534 are shown in figure  [ fig : hd76534_linefits ] .",
    "all the observed emission lines are reasonably well matched in strength , shape , and width , with the exception of the hei line , as discussed below .",
    "the model that best fits the h@xmath0 line profile is from a @xmath68 , thin disk model with a base density ( @xmath24 ) of @xmath69 and power - law index ( @xmath25 ) of 2.5 viewed at an inclination of @xmath70 .",
    "the synthetic line is somewhat narrower at the base when compared to the observed profile , indicating that either slightly more material is required closer to the star and/or the system is viewed at an inclination angle of somewhat more that @xmath71 .",
    "however , the fit was not refined along these lines .    for h@xmath1 ,",
    "the best - fit model profile is from a @xmath68 , thick disk model with base density of @xmath72 and power - law index of 3.0 , seen at the same inclination as h@xmath0 , @xmath70 .",
    "for the two feii lines , @xmath185169 and @xmath185317 , the model that fits both observed line profiles is from a 25r@xmath3 , thin disk with a base density of @xmath73 and power - law index of 3.0 , again seen at @xmath70 .    except between the two feii lines ,",
    "all of the optimal models for the individual lines differ .",
    "as noted before , these best fit models are those with the minimum value of @xmath61 .",
    "however , there is a range of other disk density models that fit each line profile nearly as well . the range of fitting models for each feature and the implications will be discussed in section  [ sec : uniquenessoffits ] .",
    "as for hd76534 s hei absorption line , it presents a special problem .",
    "the observed line profile has a wide base in the wings and a narrow absorption core .",
    "photospheric synthetic profiles were found to well fit only either the wide wings or the narrow absorption core , depending upon the viewing inclination , with @xmath74 models matching the narrow core and @xmath70 models matching the broad wings .",
    "none of the models reproduced the observed line profile as whole .",
    "absorption in the line core by the disk seems an unlikely explanation as absorption is not seen in the cores of the hydrogen lines , and the viewing inclination of the system seems close to @xmath75 as based on the other lines . as hei @xmath76  is a transition in helium s singlet spin system , we also do not expect a diffuse , forbidden component to the line profile ( as is the case for some of the triplet system ) .",
    "it is important to note that other hei lines , such as @xmath77 , @xmath8 , and @xmath78 , show the same broad base and narrow core as seen in hei @xmath67 .",
    "we have explored variations in the adopted stellar parameters ; models were calculated for @xmath79 increased by 2000k ( in order to strengthen the helium lines ) , as well with higher and lower values of @xmath80 .",
    "none of these variations were able to improve the fit to the observed hei profile .",
    "finally , we investigated the possibility of binarity , postulating that the observed hei line is actually the sum of two stellar components of very similar spectral types . as mentioned earlier ,",
    "hd76534 is already known to be a visual binary , although the separation is too large for this to be the origin of the addition spectrum .",
    "we did manage to produce an acceptable match to the hei line by combining the two photospheric profiles , i.e.  a fit to the narrow core with a profile with a @xmath81 of 49 km / s and fit the wide base component of the line profile with a model with a @xmath81 of 222 km / s .",
    "the two line profiles were combined assuming an equal flux contribution from each component , and the composite line profile is illustrated in figure  [ fig : hei_twomodels ] .",
    "thus , there is evidence that the hd76534 spectrum is actually a composite spectrum of two b stars of nearly the same spectral type .",
    "we note that we are unable to detect a systematic velocity offset between the two postulated hei components ; therefore , the binary orbit must be either very wide or the orbital plane is in the plane of the sky . despite this circumstantial evidence for a composite spectrum",

    "two other hae stars , hd 179218 and hd 141569 , were studied by  @xcite and estimated to have h@xmath0 emitting regions of size smaller than 0.21 and 0.12 au respectively .",
    "only one hbe star , mwc 361 ( hd 200775 ) , a known magnetic hbe star , has been studied using spectro - interferometric observations .",
    "@xcite found that the h@xmath0 line is emitted from disk beyond the regions generally inferred from the accretion process .",
    "they estimated the size of the h@xmath0 emitting region to be 0.22au .",
    "the values estimated for the h@xmath0 emitting regions for the hae stars may not be relevant to the three hbe stars considered in this study .",
    "however , the result of mwc  361 can be directly compared to that of the stars examind in this study .",
    "the individual fits to the h@xmath0 line profile for these three stars range anywhere from 25r@xmath3 ( 0.78 au ) to 100r@xmath3 ( 3.1 au ) . given that observations for only one early - type herbig be star are available to compare to our results , it would be very valuable to have further interferometry of the early - type herbig be stars to extend the comparisons .",
    "the key findings of this study of the inner gaseous disk of three hbe stars , hd76534 , hd216629 and hd114981 , are :    * the emission line spectra of all three stars can be adequately reproduced , in terms of both line strength and shape , from a small ( @xmath134 ) , geometrically thin , gaseous circumstellar disk heated solely by the available photoionizing radiation field from the photosphere of central b star . *",
    "the equatorial density in the disks varies roughly as @xmath135 .",
    "* the size and mass of the emitting disk are @xmath136 and @xmath137 . * the models , however , are not successful in reproducing the line profiles of hi , hei , caii and feii simultaneously based on an equatorial disk density varying as a single power - law with radius .",
    "a possible resolution is to consider equatorial density distributions that vary in a more complex way . *",
    "the equatorial density distribution of the three stars is the same as found for the hbe b2 star bd+651637 analyzed in paper i , although their disks are approximately a factor of two smaller in outer radius .",
    "we note that the current study focused exclusively on line emission from the inner gaseous disk ; however , continuum emission is also expected , at least in principle , either in the near - ir from mostly hydrogen free - free emission or in the uv from hydrogen bound - free emission",
    ". it would be important to quantify the expected level of this emission from the disks above to see if this continuum emission can make a significant contribution to either ( 1 ) the near - ir excess of hbe stars , perhaps addressing why the hbe stars seem undersized compared to the predictions of the disk size  luminosity correlation found by @xcite , or ( 2 ) the uv excess seen in some hbe stars that does not seem to be able to be reproduced by magnetospheric accretion models @xcite .",
    "finally , an important limitation of the current study is that the three hbe stars analyzed here plus bd+651637 of paper  i are all group  iii herbig ae / be objects according to the @xcite classification , that is , objects with small infrared excesses resembling classical be stars .",
    "we intend to extend our current analysis to group  i and ii objects that show unambiguous signs of dust in their infrared spectral energy distributions .",
    "we are also extending this analysis to both hotter and cooler hbe stars .",
    "the authors would like to thank the anonymous referee for many helpful comments .",
