    "<S> confocal raman spectroscopy is a versatile , non - invasive investigation tool and a major workhorse for graphene characterization . here </S>",
    "<S> we show that the experimentally observed raman 2d  line width is a measure of nanometer - scale strain variations in graphene . by investigating the relation between the g and 2d  line at high magnetic fields </S>",
    "<S> we find that the 2d  line width contains valuable information on nanometer - scale flatness and lattice deformations of graphene , making it a good quantity for classifying the structural quality of graphene even at zero magnetic field .    </S>",
    "<S> graphene combines several highly interesting material properties in a unique way , promising unprecedented material functionalities . </S>",
    "<S> this makes graphene increasingly attractive for industrial applications  @xcite but , at the same time , stresses the need for non - invasive characterization techniques . in recent years </S>",
    "<S> , raman spectroscopy has proven to be highly useful as a non - invasive method not only to identify graphene  @xcite , but also to extract information on local doping  @xcite , strain  @xcite and lattice temperature  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> even more insights can be gained when utilizing confocal , scanning raman spectroscopy to study spatially resolved doping domains  @xcite , edge effects @xcite and position dependent mechanical lattice deformations , including strain @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial resolution of so - called raman maps is on the order of the laser spot size ( which for confocal systems is typically on the order of 500  nm ) and the extracted quantities ( such as doping or strain ) are in general averaged over the spot size . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore important to distinguish between length scales significantly larger or smaller than the laser spot size . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , we will distinguish between strain variations on a _ micrometer scale _ , which can be extracted from spatially resolved raman maps , and _ </S>",
    "<S> nanometer - scale _ strain variations , which are on sub - spot - size length scales and can not be directly observed by raman imaging , but are considered as important sources of scattering for electronic transport  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> here we show that the experimentally observed raman 2d  line width is a measure of nanometer - scale strain variations in graphene on insulating substrates , i.e. it contains valuable information on local ( i.e. nanometer - scale ) flatness , lattice deformations and crystal quality of graphene . to prove that the the experimentally observed 2d  line width depends on sub - spot size strain variations and lattice deformations we employ the following strategy :    \\(i ) we start by showing that by combining raman spectroscopy with magnetic fields , electronic broadening contributions for the raman g  line width can be strongly suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> since in perpendicular magnetic fields the electronic states in graphene condense into landau levels ( lls ) , the interaction between electronic excitations and lattice vibrations becomes @xmath0  field dependent . in agreement with existing theory @xcite and experiments </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we demonstrate that by applying a perpendicular @xmath0  field of around 8  t , the g line does as good as not depend on electronic properties such as charge carrier doping , screening or electronic broadening .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(ii ) we observe that , under these conditions , the g  line width nevertheless exhibits strong variations across graphene flakes . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we show that the g  line width is significantly increased in regions where the graphene flake features bubbles and folds , i.e. in correspondence with increased structural deformations .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(iii ) finally , we show that at 8  t there is a ( nearly ) linear dependence between the g  line width and the 2d  line width , implying that there is a common source of line broadening . </S>",
    "<S> according to points ( i ) and ( ii ) the broadening must be related to structural lattice deformations . </S>",
    "<S> this finding is further supported by a detailed analysis of the relation between the area of the 2d peak and its line width . by analyzing the relation between the g and 2d  line width </S>",
    "<S> , we find that nm - scale strain variations constitute a dominant contribution to the observed line broadenings . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , the 2d  line has been shown to be only very weakly dependent on the @xmath0  field  @xcite , meaning that no magnetic field is required to extract information on nm - scale strain variations from the 2d  line width , which makes this quantity interesting for practical applications .        </S>",
    "<S> for the low temperature raman measurements , we employ a commercially available confocal raman setup that allows us to perform spatially - resolved experiments at a temperature of 4.2  k and magnetic fields of up to 9  t. we use an excitation laser wavelength of 532  nm with a spot diameter on the sample of around 500  nm . for detection , we use a single mode optical fiber and a ccd spectrometer with a grating of 1200  lines / mm . </S>",
    "<S> all measurements are performed with linear laser polarization and a @xmath1100 objective .    the investigated graphene ( gr ) sheet is partly encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride ( hbn ) and partly sandwiched between sio@xmath2 and hbn as illustrated in figure  1a . </S>",
    "<S> an optical image of our sample is shown in figure  1b . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to graphene encapsulated in hbn , graphene flakes supported by sio@xmath2 usually feature lower carrier mobilities of around @xmath3-@xmath4  @xmath5/(vs ) , indicating a detrimental influence of sio@xmath2 on the electronic properties of graphene . in this </S>",
    "<S> regard , our structure gives us the invaluable capability of probing a single graphene sheet exposed to two different substrates ( region i and ii in figures  1a and 1b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the sample is fabricated with a dry and resist - free transfer process following refs .   and , where we pick up an exfoliated graphene flake with an hbn flake and </S>",
    "<S> deposit it onto the hbn - sio@xmath2 transition area of the substrate . </S>",
    "<S> a typical raman spectrum of graphene supported by sio@xmath2 and covered by hbn , taken at the position of the red star in figure  1b , is shown in figure  1c . </S>",
    "<S> the characteristic hbn line as well as the graphene g and 2d  lines can be clearly identified . at first glance , </S>",
    "<S> the spectra recorded in the hbn - gr - hbn area look similar ( see figure  1d , taken at the position marked by the blue star in figure  1b ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is evident that the ratio between the 2d and g  line intensity is higher in this case . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the 2d  line , @xmath6 , is significantly smaller .    </S>",
    "<S> the confocal nature of our raman setup enables us to do spatially resolved measurements . </S>",
    "<S> an example of a raman map is shown in figure  1e , where the spatially resolved intensity of the hbn line is depicted . </S>",
    "<S> the hbn and sio@xmath2 areas can be clearly distinguished in the map ( see highlighted regions i and ii ) . </S>",
    "<S> when analyzing the raman spectra of every point on the map , one finds that the g  lines recorded in the hbn - encapsulated area are broader than in the sio@xmath2 supported area ( compare red and blue data points in figure  1f ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is a clear indication of reduced charge carrier doping induced by the hbn substrate compared to sio@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , at low charge carrier doping , the phonon mode can decay into electron - hole pairs , which results in a broadening of the g  peak@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for the 2d  line , in contrast , the @xmath6 recorded in the hbn - encapsulated area is mostly between 16  @xmath7 and 20  @xmath7 , while it is above 22  @xmath7 in the sio@xmath2 area ( see blue and red curves in the histogram of figure  1h , respectively ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that both @xmath6 and @xmath8 do not show a dependence on the respective frequencies @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( figures  1f and 1 g ) . in figure  1i the position of the g and 2d  lines for every spectrum obtained on the investigated graphene sheet are displayed . </S>",
    "<S> for both substrates , the data points scatter along a line with a slope of 2.2 . </S>",
    "<S> this slope coincides with the ratio of strain induced shifts ( i.e. of the related grneisen parameters ) of the raman g and 2d  modes  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that there are significant strain variations on both substrates across the entire graphene layer . </S>",
    "<S> assuming the strain to be of biaxial nature , the spread of the data points translates into a maximum , micrometer - scale strain variation of about 0.14%  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the offset of the sio@xmath2 and hbn data points can be understood in terms of the higher charge carrier doping induced by the sio@xmath2 substrate , which shifts the data points toward higher values of @xmath10  @xcite , and differences in the dielectric screening of hbn and sio@xmath2 that effectively shift the 2d line position  @xcite . since the data stems from a single graphene flake that has undergone identical fabrication steps for both substrate regions , </S>",
    "<S> the difference in charge carrier doping is unambiguously due the two different substrate materials .    , and fwhm , @xmath11 , of the g  peak as a function of magnetic field as obtained from lorentzian fits to the data shown in panel ( a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the arrow in panel ( c ) showcases a value of the magnetic field at which the phonon is energetically matched to a ll transition . </S>",
    "<S> ( d ) evolution of the energies of ll transitions with magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the full lines represent inter - band transitions in which the ll index changes by one . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed lines represent inter - band transitions in which the ll index does not change . </S>",
    "<S> the red line represents the g  mode phonon frequency at zero @xmath0  field . </S>",
    "<S> the circled region in ( c ) and ( d ) highlights the region in which no ll  transitions energetically match the g  mode phonon . ]    for a more refined comparison of the raman spectra on both substrates , we seek to suppress the effects on the g line , arising from these differences in charge carrier doping . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore minimize the influence of the electronic system on the raman g line by applying a perpendicular magnetic field . in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field , the electronic states in graphene condense into landau levels ( lls ) . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling of these landau levels to the g  mode is well understood  @xcite and experimentally confirmed  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> when a ll transition energetically matches the g  mode phonon , the position of the g  line is shifted and its line width increases . </S>",
    "<S> an example for the evolution of the raman g  peak with magnetic field , taken on the hbn sandwich area , is shown in figure  2a . </S>",
    "<S> the individual spectra are offset for clarity . for a detailed analysis </S>",
    "<S> , single lorentzians are fitted to every spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting frequency , @xmath12 , and fwhm , @xmath11 , are displayed in figures  2b and 2c , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the arrow at @xmath13  t ( figure  2c ) indicates a value of the magnetic field where a ll transition is energetically matched with the phonon , leading to a broadening of the g  line . </S>",
    "<S> however , at a magnetic field of about 8  t , no ll transition is close to the g  mode , as illustrated in figure  2d , where the energies of the relevant ll transitions as a function of magnetic field are compared to the energy of the g  mode phonon . </S>",
    "<S> consequently at this high magnetic field the influence of the electronic system on the position and width of the g  line is minimized . </S>",
    "<S> note that this effect is independent of the charge carrier density and the exact values of the broadening of the ll transitions assuming that the latter are within a reasonable range as found by other studies  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the residual broadening of the g line is most likely determined by phonon - phonon scattering and averaging effects over different strain values that vary on a nanometer scale ( i.e. sub - spot size length scale see also supplementary information ) .        to show that this applies to the entire sample , </S>",
    "<S> we first show that the broadening of the electronic states is low enough on the entire hbn - gr - hbn area . in figures  </S>",
    "<S> 3a and 3b , we show maps of @xmath8 at @xmath14  t and 3.8  t , respectively . on the hbn part , the width of the g  line shows the resonant behavior depicted in figure  2c ( see also histogram in figure  3d ) . </S>",
    "<S> this effect happens on all spots on the hbn area , independent of the local doping and strain values and independent of possible local folds and bubbles . </S>",
    "<S> the suppression of magneto - phonon resonances on the sio@xmath2 substrate can be attributed to the higher charge carrier density . at higher charge carrier density </S>",
    "<S> the needed ll transitions are blocked by the pauli principle . in a next step , </S>",
    "<S> we tune the magnetic field to 8  t , where the electronic influences on the raman g  line are at a minimum . </S>",
    "<S> a map of @xmath11 over the entire flake at a magnetic field of 8  t is shown in figure  3c . </S>",
    "<S> distinct features across the whole sample are visible as regions with increased line width . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison with a scanning force microscope image of the sample ( figure  3e ) reveals that many of these regions can be associated with folds and bubbles most likely induced during the fabrication process , some of which even cross the border between the underlying hbn and sio@xmath2 substrate regions .    </S>",
    "<S> as electronic broadening effects are suppressed at 8  t , the increased line width of the g  line in the vicinity of these lattice deformations arises from enhanced phonon - phonon scattering and/or an averaging effect over varying nm - scale strain conditions .    </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the same features can also be identified in a @xmath6  map recorded at @xmath14  t , shown in figure  3f . </S>",
    "<S> this strongly suggests that the lattice deformations identified at 8  t in @xmath8 also cause a broadening of the 2d  mode . </S>",
    "<S> the same trend is highlighted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4a , where we show the relation of @xmath11 and @xmath6 for all recorded raman spectra at 8  t. the additional teal data points stem from a graphene - on - sio@xmath2 sample and the orange star originates from a different hbn - gr - hbn sandwich structure with all data having been obtained at 8  t. notably , the points from all substrate regions lie on one common line . from this linear relation between @xmath6 and @xmath11 ( figure  4a ) </S>",
    "<S> , we conclude that there must be a common source of line broadening , which is connected to structural deformations . </S>",
    "<S> this is mainly due to the fact that at 8  t the g - line broadening is only very weakly affected by electronic contributions ( see above ) . </S>",
    "<S> the range of the presented scatter plot can be extended by including data recorded on low - quality graphene samples with significant doping , as shown in figure  4b . here , no magnetic field but high doping ( corresponding to fermi energies much higher than half of the phonon energy @xmath15  mev ) is used to suppress landau damping of the g mode , leaving @xmath8 unaffected from electronic contributions . </S>",
    "<S> the colored data points are from raman maps ( @xmath14  t ) of cvd ( chemical vapor deposition)-grown graphene flakes that were transferred onto sio@xmath2 by a wet chemistry - based transfer . </S>",
    "<S> these graphene sheets contain doping values of @xmath16  @xmath17 , which corresponds to fermi energies , @xmath18  mev ( see suppl . </S>",
    "<S> material ) . </S>",
    "<S> the data points show the same trend as the values obtained at 8  t ( gray data points in figure  4b ) and even extend the total range of the dependence to higher values of @xmath6 .        while the linear relation between @xmath11 and @xmath6 in figure 4a and 4b shows that structural deformations also broaden the 2d  line , it is less straightforward to identify the actual mechanism of broadening . it is , in principle , possible that the high values of @xmath6 around folds and bubbles are due to a combination of increased phonon - phonon scattering , averaging effects over different strain values within the laser spot and reduced electronic life times </S>",
    "<S> . however , interestingly the slopes in figures  4a and 4b are around 2.2 ( see black lines ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is a remarkable resemblance to the strain induced frequency shifts of both modes ( compare figure  1i ) . </S>",
    "<S> this provides very strong indication that averaging over different strain values , which vary on a nanometer scale ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4c ) , play an important role in the broadening of the experimentally observed 2d  line . this averaging effect broadens the g and 2d  line by the same ratio as their peak positions shift for fixed average strain values explaining the slope of 2.2 between @xmath11 and @xmath6 ( see supplementary information ) . </S>",
    "<S> we are aware that the low charge carrier densities in the hbn encapsulated area might result in a narrowing of the 2d  mode by three to four wave numbers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the large differences of @xmath6 on the order of 20 - 30  @xmath7 on both substrates can not be explained by the differences in charge carrier doping @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the lowest @xmath6 observed in our experiments are very close to the value that we compute from first - principles as in ref . </S>",
    "<S> ( see supplementary information for details ) assuming an undoped , defect - free and stress - free sample of graphene ( horizontal dashed and dotted lines in figures 4a and 4b ) . </S>",
    "<S> in such an approach , the width of the 2d peak is determined by the anharmonic decay rate of the two phonons involved ( 5.3 cm-1 according to ref . ) , and , indirectly , by the broadening of the electron and hole , denoted as @xmath19 in ref . </S>",
    "<S> , ( see also ref . ) . according to ref . </S>",
    "<S> , the electron - phonon contribution to @xmath19 is 81.9 mev for electronic states in resonance with the 2.33 ev laser - light . </S>",
    "<S> with such a value of @xmath19 we obtain a @xmath6 of 12.1 @xmath20 ( dotted lines in figures 4a , 4b and 4e ) . if , following ref . , we double such value of @xmath19 to account for the electron - electron scattering , we obtain a @xmath6 of 17.9 @xmath7 ( dashed lines in figures 4a , 4b and 4e ) , in close agreement with the lowest measured values . in principle , the observed increase of @xmath6 with respect to its minimum value could be attributed to an increase of the electronic broadening @xmath19 , due to doping ( increasing the electron - electron scattering ) or to the presence of defects ( increasing the electron - defect scattering ) @xcite . by investigating the relation between @xmath6 and the integrated area of the 2d peak ( area@xmath21 ) we can exclude such a hypothesis . in figures 4d and </S>",
    "<S> 4e we show scatter plots of @xmath6 versus the region - normalized area@xmath21 for both b  =  8  t and 0  t , highlighting the very weak b - field dependence of @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , we observe that the area of the 2d peak does not depend on @xmath6 , contrary to what is expected in presence of a variation of the electronic broadening @xmath19 @xcite . in particular the measured data </S>",
    "<S> does not follow the calculated dependence of @xmath6 on area@xmath21 , reported in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4e , obtained in the calculation by varying electronic broadening @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> this dismisses differences in the electronic broadening as a main mechanism for the observed variations of @xmath6 .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , our finding that the 2d line depends on nanometer - scale strain inhomogeneities is also in good agreement with high resolution scanning tunneling microscopy measurements , which reveal that graphene on sio2 forms short - ranged corrugations , while graphene on hbn features significantly more flat areas @xcite .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we showed that by using a magnetic field of 8  t to strongly suppress the influence of the electronic contributions on the raman g  line width , the latter can be used as a measure for the amount of nm - scale strain variations . </S>",
    "<S> most importantly , we observed a nearly linear dependence between the g and 2d  line widths at 8  t independent of the substrate material , indicating that the dominating source of the spread of the broadening of both peaks is the same . from the slope @xmath22/@xmath23 of around 2.2 </S>",
    "<S> , we deduce that averaging effects over nanometer - scale strain variations make a major contribution to this trend . </S>",
    "<S> since the 2d  line width shows only a very weak dependence on the @xmath0  field , this quantity can even be used without a magnetic field to gain information on the local strain homogeneity and thus on the structural quality of graphene . </S>",
    "<S> these insights can be potentially very valuable for monitoring graphene fabrication and growth processes in research and industrial applications , where a fast and non - invasive control of graphene lattice deformations is of great interest . </S>"
