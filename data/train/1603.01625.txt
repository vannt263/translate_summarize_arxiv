    "early on , quantum mechanics was judged unable to describe the measurement process .",
    "the spatial spread of the wave function was in conflict with that particles were recorded in a well - defined place or direction .",
    "born gave the rule that the probability distribution is given by the wave function absolute squared @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "bohr and heisenberg took the view that quantum mechanics is correct in the microscopic world .",
    "however , at the act of measurement , a transition is necessary to `` classical '' description for the macroscopic detector .",
    "this view has been called the copenhagen interpretation .",
    "it is sometimes taken to mean that the wave function collapses into a state consistent with the measured value .",
    "no mechanism or explanation of the transition from quantum to classical or the collapse was given .",
    "the dichotomy between quantum and classical description has been problematic and led to statements of the kind `` quantum mechanics is impossible to understand '' .",
    "mermin @xcite wrote `` shut up and calculate '' to sum up what the copenhagen interpretation meant to him .",
    "it has served us well to calculate system properties with the quantum equations and using born s probability rule when applicable .",
    "further investigations of the foundation of quantum mechanics have been given a low priority within the physics community .",
    "this may be understood from that a partial description is better than no description of nature .",
    "but , a full description is always more desirable than a partial description .",
    "einstein refused to believe that the fundamental physics is probabilistic @xcite .",
    "the quantum physics could at best be an effective theory , covering up a deeper reality .",
    "the wave function amplitude is often called the probability amplitude as if its sole purpose is to give probabilities .",
    "but that terminology suggests that a classical particle is lurking behind the scenes .",
    "this is difficult to reconcile with the superposition principle , which is of ultimate importance . for the particle to be revealed there has to be a deviation from the state vector description .",
    "we have no evidence for a mechanism that produces any deviation from the quantum state vector description .",
    "quantum physics has ben enormously successful in describing the detailed physics of solids , molecules , atoms , nuclei and particle physics .",
    "is it really sensible to claim that this theory only describes what happens in between preparation and measurement , but not the measurement process ? when i sit on a chair , i do a continuous observation of its stability that is explained by the wave nature of electrons .",
    "if the observation makes quantum physics invalid , how come the chair still holds me up ? as we do observations all the time of phenomena that are explained by quantum mechanics , it seems that quantum mechanics also describes what happens during measurements .",
    "an important step towards erasing the dichotomy between state vector evolution and measurement was taken by everett in 1957 @xcite . in everett",
    "s interpretation , the state vector completely describes the state of ( the relevant parts of ) the physical world .",
    "how quantum mechanics may describe the measurement process was presented .",
    "everett noted that a measurement will lead to entanglement between the system being measured and the detector .",
    "an observer that reads of the detector can be viewed as being another detector that measures this entangled state and hence gets entangled with it .",
    "after the measurement , the total state is ( still ) a sum over all possibilities of the measured system .",
    "each term describes the measured system in a state of the precise value of the measured property , the detector has registered that value so has the observer .",
    "these terms were called branches and they have one important property in common . the observer has experienced that one particular value was measured , but the observed value differs between the branches .",
    "the problems of previous interpretations seem to be resolved by this observation , though one important aspect was missing and another was insufficiently treated .",
    "firstly , it was not shown that the branches can not interfere which is necessary for the branching to be well defined .",
    "zeh @xcite noted this problem and realized that its solution was the process we call decoherence @xcite .",
    "this also explains why the macroscopic world we experience obeys the laws of classical physics .",
    "secondly , as this theory tries to describe the process of measurement in quantum mechanical terms , the probabilities as given by born s rule should be derived from the theory .",
    "the latter point was attempted by everett but his argumentation was insufficient , see section [ previous ] .",
    "a weakness of everett s theory lies in a lack of state vector interpretation .",
    "everett @xcite writes `` the wave function is taken as the basic physical entity with _ no a priori interpretation_. interpretation comes after an investigation of the logical structure of the theory '' .",
    "this idea still prevails as illustrated by the following citation from tegmark @xcite `` ... postulates in english regarding interpretation would be ( mathematically ) derivable and thus redundant '' .",
    "also in wallace thorough exposition of everett s quantum mechanics @xcite the lack of interpretation of the quantities of the theory remains .",
    "this is criticized by maudlin @xcite who comments `` taking away the measurement postulates ... robs the textbook recipe of any empirical consequences '' .",
    "equations that describe physical processes always need to be interpreted .",
    "ballantine @xcite makes this clear in the following quote `` from the formalism @xmath7 , one can not deduce that @xmath8 is a force , @xmath9 is a mass , and @xmath10 is an acceleration '' .    without an interpretation , there can be no meaning to expressions derived from the wave function .",
    "this means there has to be : ( 1 ) a correspondence between the quantities that enter into the equations and well defined physical phenomena and observations ; ( 2 ) an understanding of what the equations are able to describe , their region of applicability .",
    "the purpose of this article is to give an interpretation of the quantum state , suitable to describe the measurement as a quantum process including how born s rule arises . for this end ,",
    "quantum theory is supplied with a new set of postulates replacing the traditional postulates .",
    "in heisenberg s article @xcite that came to be the starting point of quantum mechanics , he aimed to replace the notion of a definite position of the electron with a quantity that could give transition probabilities using the classical dipole radiation formulas .",
    "he also aimed to reach a theory that could be generalized to more systems than the bohr - sommerfeld orbits could be applied to .",
    "thus quantum mechanics is about position though the particle position concept is different from classical mechanics .",
    "schrdinger @xcite sought to find an equation for a ( wave ) function of space , that could give the quantized energies . at the large quantum number limit",
    ", there is a clear correspondence between wave function and the classical mechanical orbit , at least for integrable systems .",
    "thus , the wave function replaces the where and how of the classical orbit .",
    "postulate 1 ( eqm1)[postulatestate ] : :    the meaning of the state :    +    the state is a set of complex functions of positions    @xmath11 where @xmath1 is a discrete index , for    example spin and gauge components .",
    "its basic interpretation is given    by that the density    @xmath12 answers where the system is in position , spin , etc .",
    "it is absolute square integrable normalized to one    @xmath13 this requirement signifies that the system has to be    somewhere , not everywhere . if the value of the integral is zero , the    system does nt exist anywhere .",
    "comment to eqm1[comment1 ] : :    with the usual way of denoting the norm @xmath14 ,    equation ( [ norm ] ) can be written @xmath15 .    +    if something is possible to measure , then it is possible to separate    such a small part from the rest .",
    "the separated part will act as a    system of its own , thus can not have zero norm .",
    "the difference between    two states @xmath16  and @xmath17 for which    @xmath18 can have no measurable    consequences , as will be clear from sections [ singlemes ] and    [ section : repeated ] .",
    "this implies that the state of the system can be    viewed as a vector in the hilbert space of functions of the type    ( [ psi ] ) , see the appendix .",
    "+    if the index @xmath1 contains gauge components , these ought to    be summed over in equation ( [ density ] ) to get a gauge independent    density .",
    "the state function @xmath19 is not directly    observable as it is gauge dependent .",
    "postulate 2 ( eqm2 ) [ postulatetd ] : :    the equation of motion :    +    there is a unitary time development of the state , e.g. ,    @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the hermitian    hamiltonian .",
    "the term unitary signifies that the value of the left    hand side in ( [ norm ] ) is constant for any state ( [ psi ] ) of the system .",
    "comment to eqm2 : :    when investigating how the theory describe the world we observe the    hamiltonian has to have realistic features .    +    the quantum world around us is understood in terms of local    interactions . the standard model of particle physics is formulated in    terms of locally interacting fields .",
    "this implies that we only have to    understand and interpret quantum mechanics with local interactions .",
    "in    particular , measurement processes are physical processes confined to    the interactions available .",
    "position measurements are the single most    important type of measurement , indicating that locality of    interactions is a fundamental aspect of real measurements . in    connection with measurements",
    ", it can safely be assumed that    interactions are such that there is a locally conserved current .",
    "the following shortened version @xcite show the essentials of the copenhagen interpretation : ( c1 ) the state of a physical system is a normalized vector @xmath22 in a hilbert space @xmath21 which evolves unitarily with time ; ( c2 ) every measurable quantity is described by a hermitian operator ( observable ) @xmath23 acting in @xmath21 ; ( c3 ) the only possible result of measuring a physical quantity is one of the eigenvalues of the corresponding observable @xmath23 ; ( c4 ) the probability for obtaining eigenvalue @xmath24 in a measurement of @xmath23 is @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the projector onto the eigen - subspace of @xmath23 having eigenvalue @xmath24 .    adding the collapse postulate `` the post - measurement state in such a measurement is @xmath27 '' the postulates correspond to what schlosshauer @xcite called the standard interpretation .",
    "some modern formulations of the postulates allow for positive operator value measurements , but that generalization offers nothing extra here .",
    "it is the same as the projection value measurement postulates ( c2 - 4 ) up to a unitary transformation @xcite .",
    "both c1 and eqm1 establish that the state must be normalizable , but in the latter case , it is motivated by a physical condition .",
    "eqm1 differs from c1 in that there is no mention of hilbert space .",
    "instead , the normalization requirement ( [ norm ] ) implies that the state belongs to a hilbert space .    in eqm1",
    "there is no mention of any relation between the density ( [ density ] ) and probability . when the propagation of different parts is dependent on each other due to coherence , the concept of probability is not relevant .",
    "however , the density @xmath28 as a distribution of the particles positions is always relevant .",
    "it is similar to schrdinger s original interpretation of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "the following relations lends support to the interpretation of the density @xmath29 as the distributed position .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , the discrete index @xmath10 , as well as the time dependence are omitted here .",
    "* the continuity equation for a single particle , @xmath30 shows that the distribution of particle positions changes in a continuous manner . * in first order perturbation theory , the correction to the energy for a single particle is given by @xmath31 an outside agent interacts with the system weakly enough not to essentially change the state will find that it interacts with a distribution , not with particles in a definite position .",
    "* we can define the average position as the first moment of the density distribution @xmath32 according to ehrenfest theorem , if the force @xmath33 is essentially constant in the region where the density is appreciable , the average position will move according to newtons law , @xmath34 if the width of the density distribution is  small \" it gives the position of a particle moving along as classical particle . * the particles are not at positions where the density is zero . * from molecular , atomic , nuclear and particle physics",
    "it is well established that the single particle density of @xmath35 electrons , protons or quarks @xmath36 gives the charge density if multiplied with the charge a single particle .",
    "+ in the oppenheimer - born approximation , the nuclei interact with the ( instantaneous ) charge distribution of the electrons as given by equation [ eq : single_particle_density ] .",
    "+ in nuclear physics , the comparison between calculated charge distribution and experimental is an important method to test theories , see @xcite .    as the measurement process is a physical process described by the dynamics ( eqm2 ) there are no new postulates corresponding to c2 - 4 .",
    "how does real physical measurement processes correspond to the c - postulates ? in order to answer that question , this article will not address everyday observations but confine the discussion to measurements in designated experimental setups .    for well - defined values to be recorded",
    ", it is necessary the detection system creates decoherence .",
    "this is a definite result of the modern analysis of everett s quantum mechanics .",
    "if definite values can be measured in a situation where the measured state contains a variation of values , decoherence must be active . if not , this interpretation would be disproved .",
    "it is difficult to analyze , which quantities can possibly be measured based on all conceivable experimental setups .",
    "but , an understanding of the fundamentals of measurements can be achieved from the fundamentals of detectors .",
    "detectors can typically measure the position and sometimes also the kinetic energy .",
    "the momentum of a charged particle can be transformed into a measurement of position .",
    "the measurement of angular momentum in a fixed direction can be transformed into an energy measurement by the zeeman effect or into position by a stern - gerlach apparatus .",
    "these are examples physical measurement processes that correspond to hermitian operators .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that all types of measurements transform the property in question to measure a position or simply counting particles , or that the measurement procedure is related to that in the way it is calibrated .",
    "thus , the following discussion of measurements will be confined to the recording of a particle entering a detector .",
    "this detector may be a part of an array of detectors and by that measure its position .",
    "particle recording detectors react when a particle is entering a certain volume or area .",
    "there is an infinite set of states with support inside the volume ( area ) and another infinite set of orthonormal states with support only outside .",
    "together they make up a complete basis .",
    "the hermitian operator that corresponds to measurements with this detector can be defined such that all the inside states are eigenstates with a common eigenvalue and the outside with another value .",
    "this detector can only tell whether a particle came into it or not .",
    "a less crude position detector may be constructed by placing several such particle recorders at a multitude of positions .",
    "the hermitian operator for this composite detector may be constructed by associating the same value for all states inside one particle recorder , but different values for different recorders .",
    "additionally , another value should be attributed to the outside of all particle recorders .",
    "this detector records if any of the individual particle recorders fired and which fired .    obviously , the detector described so far is highly idealized .",
    "for example , it is unrealistic that a particle recording detector can register particles at any energy .",
    "but at a specific experiment , the energy range of the particles is limited .",
    "the described model is relevant as long the efficiency is close to 100% in the real experiment .",
    "t is assumed that the measurement setup is such that , which particle recorder the particle reaches is given by its value of the property being measured .",
    "there is is a unitary operator @xmath37 corresponding to the hamiltonian @xmath38 that describes this part of the experimental setup .",
    "denote the hermitian operator that corresponds to the position detector with @xmath39 .",
    "the operator @xmath40  being measured by @xmath39 and the unitary evolution @xmath41 is given by @xmath42 the eigenstates @xmath43 of @xmath44 are related to eigenstates of @xmath39 by @xmath45 as described above , each eigenvalue of @xmath39 is typically degenerate . according to ( [ adef ] )",
    ", the same applies to @xmath44 but as noted above in an actual experiment only a small number of states are involved . for simplicity , it is assumed that only one state per particle recorder is relevant .     due to the unitary transformation @xmath41 .",
    "the state @xmath46 transforms to @xmath47 by @xmath41 . ]    sometimes , the quantity given by the operator @xmath44 is a vehicle to make it possible to measure another property .",
    "for example , in a stern - gerlach experiment , the physics of half - integer spins is investigated but it is the position of silver atoms that are measured .",
    "denote by @xmath48  be the quantity that the experiment is intended to measure .",
    "the eigenstates of @xmath23 are used as a basis for the state to be measured , @xmath49 the operators @xmath44 and @xmath23 may be the same so that @xmath50 or @xmath51 where the factor @xmath52 is there to complete the state @xmath53 to the physical particle in state @xmath54 .",
    "the state that enters the position detector system is @xmath55 this expresses that the different eigenstates @xmath56 enters separate particle recorders and is there represented by @xmath57 , see figure [ experiment ] . due to that the functions @xmath58 have disjoint spatial support , the density of the state ( [ detectordist ] ) is @xmath59    it describes where the system is according to eqm1 .",
    "summation over the spin and integration over the volume of one of the particle recorders will give the value @xmath60 , where @xmath24 is the eigenvalue of @xmath23 associated with that recorder .",
    "the interpretation of this result is that @xmath61 as a function of the discrete variable @xmath24 tells where the system is with respect to the eigenvalue of @xmath23 .",
    "note that this result is an important step towards replacing the old axioms c2 and c3 with eqm1 and eqm2 .",
    "so far , the interaction between the particle and the detector has been ignored .",
    "the decoherence necessary for a measurement to happen relies on this interaction . that the interactions are local is an important assumption for the theory of decoherence and is also important to guarantee that position measurements are possible .",
    "to simplify the discussion it will be assumed that the state @xmath62 ( [ psi ] ) , rather than @xmath63 , directly interacts with the detector as the distinction between @xmath64 and @xmath65 is no longer needed .",
    "then , the interaction with the detector @xmath66 leads to the transition @xmath67 the detector changes its state from its nothing registered state @xmath68 to a state @xmath69 consistent with having registered the state @xmath70 .",
    "the state of the system before the measurement @xmath71 and after @xmath72 , may be the same .",
    "after the experimentalist has observed the detector its state still belongs to the set of states consistent with that the state @xmath71 has been registered .",
    "the observation process is described by @xmath73 where the state of the detector @xmath74 is not altered .",
    "due to the complicated nature of the detector , the observer and their interactions with the environment , the possibility of interference between the different terms in the final state of ( [ eq : measurement ] ) or ( [ eq : observation ] ) disappears rapidly .",
    "the different terms will belong to different  worlds \" as they will evolve independently of each other .",
    "this is the process of decoherence and is an essential point of the many world understanding of quantum physics .",
    "it guarantees that in any of the  worlds \" , the observer has seen one particular value and has no direct knowledge of the readings made in the other  worlds \" .",
    "zeh @xcite has pointed out that the decoherence theory depends on born s rule , which means that the density @xmath75 is used to interpret some results . as the eqm1 gives an interpretation of @xmath75 it replaces born s rule as a means to interpret such results .",
    "so far , it is clear that the contents of c2 and c3 are fully understood as a result of the unitary quantum evolution .",
    "the quantity being measured is associated with a hermitian operator and the result of the measurement is one of its eigenvalues .    looking at the many  worlds \" from the outside the question : what reading did the observer get ?",
    "is equivalent to what is the distribution of observer readings ? -",
    "the answer is given by the distribution @xmath76 ( [ rhob ] ) .",
    "this value can also be arrived at calculating the total density ( the norm ) of the @xmath24-term in the final state of ( [ eq : measurement ] ) or ( [ eq : observation ] ) . note that once decoherence has taken place the created  worlds \" evolve independently , which keeps their norms conserved .",
    "suppose the detector is able to record several subsequent measurements of identically prepared systems ( [ psi ] ) .",
    "further , assume that the way the detector interacts with the next system is not affected by previous measurements .",
    "the second measurement is described by the transition @xmath77 when the interaction with the observer is included the final state becomes @xmath78 each sequence of readings belong to different  worlds \" .",
    "the distribution of observer reading sequences is now@xmath79 after @xmath35 measurements , the sequences of observer readings are distributed according to @xmath80 when @xmath35 is large , the relative frequencies of the values of @xmath24 became interesting . to focus on the value @xmath81 ,",

    "an operator should be found that is closely related to this distribution .",

    "as the eigenvalues @xmath121 of @xmath120 is a discrete set its density distribution @xmath123 is represented be a bar graph rather than the histogram that represents @xmath108 .    to see the behavior of these densities as @xmath35 approaches infinity the chebyshev s inequality @xcite can be applied to the distribution @xmath97 ( [ eq : a _ m - times ] ) .",
    "the result can be written as @xmath124 from this follows that @xmath125 as @xmath92 and that @xmath126 approaches one for any value of @xmath127 .",

    "after a long sequence of measurements , the observer is distributed over very many branches . in each branch , a random sequence is observed which call for a statistical analysis by the observer .",

    "if it is assumed that the observer s branch is reasonably typical , the observer experiences borns s rule when the number of repeated experiments are large , unless an exceptional sequence appears .",
    "such sequences are also a consequence of born s rule as any mechanism giving born s rule must also give rise to possible but improbable sequences .",

    "the frequentist solution is to define probability from a measure on sets as described in @xcite .",
    "infinite sequences of events show the same frequency except for a set of sequences of measure zero .",
    "probability is here identified with frequency .",

    "probability is here related to decisions an agent is willing to make @xcite .",
    "the derivation of quantum probabilities given here has much in common with the bayesian view .",
    "it is derived that physicists in a typical branch believe in born s rule .",

    ".    the present derivation may also be acceptable from a frequentists point view due to the focus on relative frequency .",
    "in the next section , it will be also shown that the state describing infinitely many repeated measurements has a well - defined frequency .",
    "hence , in quantum physics , the frequency can be calculated without using the probability concept , unlike the classical situation .",
    "to get a solid argumentation for born s probability rule , one can not assume the properties of the rule beforehand .",
    "for example , one can not assume that probability applies to quantum mechanics .",
    "it could be that most sequences that an observer sees do nt follow the patterns implied by probability laws .",

    "the discussion of which unproved statements could be made into postulates is deferred to the next section ( [ sec : altposts ] ) .",
    "everett @xcite shows that the observer in a repeated measurement will see a random series of results in each branch .",
    "he then concludes that  we must put some sort of measure ( weighting ) in the elements of a final superposition \" .",
    "everett assumes that the measure only depends on the ( absolute ) value of the amplitudes @xmath136 ( [ psi ] ) , which implies that the measure is independent of other properties of the state .",

    "he argues that the measure is the desired probability measure from that it is conserved over time and has the right mathematical properties for branching worlds .",
    "hence , everett s ",
    "proof  is only indicative and not conclusive .",

    "gutmann @xcite subsequently produced a proof that circumvents the renormalization procedure .",

    "they seem to be taken as ` obvious ' in spite of that it was not even explained how states get a probability associated to them .",
    "it is important not to rely on any intuitions acquired from working with the standard postulates in order to avoid circularity .",

    "their philosophical argumentation for this principle was based on the world we are experiencing , rather than from quantum mechanics .",
    "this means that they assumed that quantum mechanics give rise to the world we encounter .",
    "their argumentation seems circular but we could simply consider the principle as an unproven assumption .",
    "wallace has vigorously pursued to derive born s rule in eqm from a bayesian single case point of view . in his book @xcite there are two different proofs . in the first",
    ", he assumed there is some function of subspaces of hilbert space to a positive real number that fulfills what a probability reasonably should fulfill .",
    "wallace implicitly assumed that unitary transformations do nt change probabilities which imply that the probabilities are independent of context .",

    "so far , no proof of born s rule exists .",
    "the statement in c1 , that the state is a member of a hilbert space , is a mathematical statement and it lacks direct physical content . in the absence of an interpretation of @xmath75 as in eqm1 or born rule ,",
