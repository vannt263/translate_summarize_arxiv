    "higgsless models , as the name implies , break the electroweak symmetry without invoking a fundamental scalar particle . inspired by the idea that one could maintain perturbative unitarity in extra - dimensional models through heavy vector resonance exchanges in lieu of a higgs @xcite , higgsless models were intially introduced in an extra - dimensional context as @xmath0 gauge theories living in a slice of @xmath1 , with symmetry breaking codified in the boundary condition of the gauge fields @xcite .",
    "it emerged that the low energy dynamics of these extra - dimensional models can be understood in terms of a collection of 4-d theories , using the principle of `` deconstruction '' @xcite .",
    "essentially , this involves latticizing the extra dimension , associating a 4-d gauge group with each lattice point and connecting them to one another by means of nonlinear sigma models . the five dimensional gauge field is now spread in this theory as four dimensional gauge fields residing at each lattice point , and the fifth scalar component residing as the eaten pion in the sigma fields . the picture that emerges",
    "is called a `` moose '' diagram  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 correspondence suggests that these models can be understood to be dual to strongly coupled technicolor models .",
    "the key features of these models @xcite are the following :    * spin-1 resonances created by the techni - dynamics are described as massive gauge bosons , following the hidden - local - symmetry setup originally used for qcd  @xcite .",
    "the mass of the resonances is roughly @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is around the weak scale and @xmath5 is a large coupling .",
    "interactions of the resonances with other gauge bosons and fermions are calculated as a series in @xmath6 .",
    "* standard model ( sm ) fermions reside primarily on the exterior sites  the sites approximately corresponding to @xmath7 and @xmath8 gauge groups .",
    "fermions become massive through mixing with massive , vector - like fermions located on the interior , ` hidden ' sites . *",
    "precision electroweak parameters ( s , t , u ) , perennially a thorn in the side of dynamical electroweak breaking models  @xcite , are accommodated by delicately spreading the sm fermions between sites . by adjusting the fermion distribution across sites to match the gauge boson distribution , s , t ,",
    "u can all be reduced to acceptable levels .",
    "this is identical to the solution used in extra - dimensional higgsless models , where the spreading of a fermion among sites becomes a continuous distribution , or profile , in the extra dimension  @xcite .",
    "this adjustment is called `` ideal delocalization '' @xcite .    the most economical deconstructed higgsless model constructed along these lines ( a `` three site '' model )",
    "was presented in @xcite , and had , in addition to the sm spectrum , one heavy partner for each fermion and the @xmath9 and @xmath10 bosons .",
    "though providing an excellent ground for studying the low - energy properties of higgsless models , the mass of the heavy dirac partners of the sm fermions in this model was constrained to lie at @xmath11 2 tev , because of the tension between obtaining the correct value for the top - quark mass and keeping @xmath12 within experimental bounds . to alleviate this constraint , an extension of the three site model",
    "was constructed @xcite , whose goal was to separate the top - quark mass generation from the rest of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) , thus relaxing the aforementioned constraint .",
    "this idea of treating the top - quark mass as arising from a separate dynamics is not new - in fact , topcolor - assisted technicolor models @xcite employ precisely this idea .",
    "topcolor - assisted technicolor is a scenario of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking in which the strong dynamics is partitioned into two different sectors .",
    "one sector , the technicolor sector , is responsible for the bulk of electroweak symmetry breaking and is therefore characterized by a scale @xmath13 , where @xmath14 246 gev is the ewsb scale .",
    "consequently , technicolor dynamics is responsible for the majority of gauge boson masses and , more indirectly , light fermion masses .",
    "the second strong sector , the topcolor sector , only communicates directly with the top quark .",
    "its sole purpose is to generate a large mass for the top quark . in generating a top quark mass",
    ", this second sector also breaks the electroweak symmetry .",
    "if the characteristic scale of the topcolor sector is low , @xmath15 , it plays only a minor role in electroweak breaking , but can still generate a sufficiently large top quark mass given a strong enough top - topcolor coupling . at low - energies ,",
    "the top - color dynamics is summarized by the existence of a new dynamical top - higgs which couples preferentially to the top - quark .",
    "the introduction of the top - higgs field serves to alleviate the tension between obtaining the correct top quark mass and keeping @xmath12 small that exists in higgsless models by separating the top quark mass generation from the rest of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "an important consequence of this separation is that the model permits heavy dirac partners for the fermions that are potentially light enough to be seen at the lhc .",
    "thus , the combination of two symmetry - breaking mechanisms can achieve both dynamical electroweak breaking and a realistic top quark mass .    because electroweak symmetry is effectively broken twice in this scenario",
    ", there are two sets of goldstone bosons in the theory .",
    "one triplet of these goldstones is eaten to become the longitudinal modes of the @xmath16 , while the other triplet remains in the spectrum .",
    "this remaining triplet , typically called the top - pions , and a singlet partner , the top - higgs , are the focus of this paper .",
    "the top - pions and top - higgs couple preferentially to the third generation of quarks , which makes them interesting for a number of reasons .",
    "first , the interactions of the top quark are the least constrained of all fermions , so new dynamics coupling preferentially to the top quark is not phenomenologically excluded .",
    "second , the gluon fusion mechanism involves a top quark loop and is an efficient method for singly producing top - higgses and neutral top - pions at the lhc .",
    "in fact , the strong top - quark ",
    "topcolor interaction , manifest in a top yukawa of order @xmath11 few , significantly enhances the coupling of top - higgs and top - pions relative to a sm higgs of equal mass .",
    "such a large cross section leads to exciting lhc signals which may be discoverable in the initial low - energy , low - luminosity run .",
    "our goal in this paper is to lay the foundation for phenomenological studies of the top - pions and top - higgs at the lhc .",

    "the gauge symmetry is broken all the way down to electromagnetism and we are left with massive gauge bosons ( analogous to techni - resonances ) , top - pions and a top - higgs . to keep track of how the degrees of freedom are partitioned after we impose the symmetry breaking , we expand @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 around their vevs .",
    "the coset degrees of freedom in the bi - fundamental link fields @xmath21 and @xmath22 can be described by nonlinear sigma fields : @xmath37 while the degrees of freedom in @xmath23 fill out a linear representation , @xmath38    the gauge - kinetic terms in eq .",

    "the photon remains massless and is given by the exact expression @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the electromagnetic coupling .",

    "the result of the diagonalization of the gauge boson matrices perturbatively in @xmath45 is summarized in appendix a.    counting the number of degrees of freedom , we see that there are six scalar degrees of freedom on the technicolor side ( @xmath46 ) and four on the topcolor side ( @xmath23 ) .",

    "are sufficient to give mass to the gauge bosons , the top - pions and top - higgs remain massless at tree level .",
    "quantum corrections will give the top - pions a mass , however this loop - level mass is far too small to be consistent with experimental constraints . to generate phenomenologically acceptable masses for the top - pions and top - higgs , we add two additional interactions : @xmath52 where the first of these interactions arises from topcolor interactions , and the second from etc - like interactions  @xcite . here",

    "the second term gives mass to both the top - higgs and the physical ( uneaten ) combination of pion fields , as we will show shortly .",
    "because these masses depend on two parameters , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , we can treat the mass of the top - higgs and the common mass of the uneaten top - pions as two independent parameters .",
    "in addition to generating masses , the potential in eq .   also induces interactions between the top - higgs and top - pions which can be important .",
