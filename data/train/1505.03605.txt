    "we modeled rocking curves ( rcs ) as the convolution of an _ intrinsic _ intensity distribution with a smearing _",
    "resolution function_. the former corresponds to the actual @xmath81-dependence of the structure factor , while the latter accounts for imperfect collimation and wavelength spread . for simplicity",
    ", the resolution function was assumed to be a gaussian kernel with standard deviation @xmath82 . since",
    "rocking curves are already integrated within the detector plane , only the longitudinal dependence of the structure factor is relevant .    when spatial correlations of the vl decay strongly with certain characteristic length scale , the envelope of the correlation function can be modeled with an exponential function .",
    "so , the structure factor @xmath83 ( the fourier transform of the correlation function ) must be lorentzian - shaped , i.e. @xmath84 where @xmath65 is the corresponding correlation length .",
    "therefore , we took the intrinsic distribution to be the cauchy - lorentz distribution centred at the bragg angle @xmath85 , multiplied by a proportionality constant @xmath86 .",
    "then , its half width at half maximum ( hwhm ) @xmath87 is directly related to @xmath65 by @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the magnitude of one reciprocal vector of the vl .",
    "the resulting intensity profile is @xmath90 in the limiting cases of long correlation lengths @xmath91 , ( i.e. when @xmath65 is beyond our resolution ) the intrinsic distribution can be replaced by a dirac delta , so @xmath92 .",
    "\\label{longcorr}\\ ] ] and the experimental rcs can be just modeled by the gaussian resolution distribution .",
    "neutron count data were preprocessed by the software grasp @xcite .",
    "detector counts were normalized by monitor counts .",
    "then , after background subtraction , intensity integrated over a fixed sector of the detector was calculated for each image , and resulting rocking curves @xmath93 , @xmath94 , were exported , together with their error estimates @xmath95 .",
    "statistical analysis was carried out using the software octave @xcite .",
    "it consisted of three stages :    1 .   preliminary analysis , 2 .",
    "resolution estimation , 3 .   intrinsic widths estimation",
    ".      non linear optimization often requires set of initial parameters close enough to the optimal in order to work properly .",
    "the aim of this stage was to obtain suitable estimates of the parameters for each rocking curve individually , to be used in later stages .",
    "we did this by fitting our convolution model individually to each rocking curve .",
    "because of the convolution , the parameters @xmath58 and @xmath87 are expected to be highly correlated , making it difficult to fit both simultaneously . to overcome this issue , a rough prior theoretical estimate of @xmath58 , based on the experimental geometry @xcite , was calculated .",
    "this resulted in @xmath96 .",
    "a modified likelihood function @xmath97 was then constructed and parameters were obtained from minimizing @xmath98      the preliminary analysis showed that configurations shaken at low temperatures ( examples are shown with red and violet symbols in figure [ fig2](c ) ) were resolution limited ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "therefore , we used the long - correlation - length approximation ( eq . [ longcorr ] ) to model these rocking curves . in turn , it enabled us to make an independent estimation of the resolution based solely on neutron data .",
    "the resolution profile likelihood @xmath100 was constructed by maximizing the global likelihood function ( i. e. , including all rocking curves ) , constrained to @xmath58 taking a series of fixed values .",
    "we obtained @xmath101 , which is consistent with our prior estimate .",
    "this also revealed that the dependence of the estimated @xmath102 on the resolution width was common to all the curves .",
    "examples of the resulting fitting curves are shown in full red and violet lines in figure [ fig2](c ) .",
    "next , we determined the minimum intrinsic width @xmath102 which could be eventually distinguishable from the zero - width approximation .",
    "this was done by generating randomized rocking curves of different widths with the convolution model , using the above estimation of @xmath58 .",
    "similar number of points and relative errors as in our experimental data were considered . after fitting gaussian functions to generated data",
    ", a threshold of @xmath103 out of 200 replicates resulting in non - overlapping error bars ( one standard deviation ) between @xmath104 and the fitted width was applied .",
    "this resulted in @xmath105 , or @xmath106 @xmath107 ( vertical dashed line in figure [ fig4](b ) ) .",
    "lastly , the profile likelihood of @xmath102 for each rocking curve was constructed by fitting only @xmath86 and @xmath85 , while letting @xmath108 be the estimated above ( fixed ) .",
    "this procedure reduced marginal errors in @xmath102 by ignoring the covariance with @xmath108 . since a change in @xmath108 would only shift all estimated @xmath102 together ,",
    "this approach is better suited for comparing different configurations instead of finding the exact correlation length .",
    "the resulting likelihood ratios @xmath64 ( curves in figure [ fig4](b ) ) where then obtained through the relationship between @xmath65 and @xmath102 ( eq . [ corrl ] ) .    as long as the elastic approximation is valid , the in - plane characteristic lengths @xmath109 in equilibrium configurations can be estimated from the elastic ratio @xcite @xmath110 where @xmath77 and @xmath76 are the shear and tilt elastic vl moduli respectively . in the local approximation @xcite ,",

    "the fact that all the bps are resolution limited , indicates that all the measured vl configurations are not in the amorphous limit .",
    "far from the amorphous limit , the elastic approximation is still roughly valid for equilibrium configurations with dislocations @xcite .",
    "however , as mentioned in the main text , the partially disordered vls are metastable configurations at @xmath116 , originated from a dynamic reorganization in the vicinity of the odt , and therefore a quantitative calculation of @xmath117 from @xmath65 is not available .",
    "a rough estimation using the elastic limit at @xmath118 ( where the local approximation for the elastic constant is valid ) gives @xmath119 and @xmath120 for configurations with intermediate disorder .",
    "a better estimate can be made in the framework of a defective vl @xcite at high temperature ( where the dynamic reorganization occurs ) . in this model",
    "each correlated volume @xmath121 is limited by dislocations spaced in @xmath8 and @xmath65 in the transverse and longitudinal directions respectively .",

    "the resulting @xmath127 are @xmath128-independent in this limit and the in - plane correlation lengths corresponding to the experimental @xmath129 result @xmath130 and @xmath131 for intermediate disordered configurations , slightly larger to that obtained in the elastic limits .",
    "although these values are not quantitatively exact , these estimates could be useful to design future sans experiments .",
    "equation ( [ intdist ] ) is properly normalized so that the parameter @xmath75 represents the total integrated intensity .",
    "the maximum - likelihood estimate for @xmath75 and the corresponding variance were obtained along with the other parameters discussed above for each rc . in order to compare integrated intensities corresponding to different configurations , the dispersion in the intensities fitted to rcs measured after different histories were statistically assessed by means of @xmath132 difference tests of nested models .",
    "the results of the tests are presented indicating the statistic @xmath132 , the degrees of freedom @xmath133 , and the corresponding @xmath134-value ( i. e. , the probability of getting a @xmath132 greater than the observed one solely due to randomness , under the assumption that a common mean is shared ) .",
    "first we note that the set of all the values of @xmath75 had far more dispersion ( relative to their errors ) than expected for a single mean value model ( @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 ) . in order to assess whether this excessive dispersion was connected to the different histories ,",
    "the dispersion within sets of @xmath75 corresponding to each process was evaluated .",
    "all intensities corresponding to fc configurations were indistinguishable ( @xmath138 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 ) and intensities corresponding to intermediate - order configurations were only marginally distinguishable ( @xmath141 , @xmath139 , @xmath142 ) . moreover , merging the sets of intensities for fc and intermediate - order configurations did not increase the dispersion enough to reject a single mean intensity for both ( @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 ) . on the contrary , bg configurations presented a higher degree of variability , beyond their estimated variance ( @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 ) and the set of intensities for bg configurations could not be merged with fc and intermediate - order configurations without increasing the dispersion significantly ( @xmath149 , @xmath144 , @xmath137 ) .",
    "these results suggest that all rcs for fc and intermediate - order configurations share essentially the same value for the parameter @xmath75 .",
    "instead , fits to rcs for bg configurations yielded statistically distinguishable values for the total integrated intensity , which averaged about @xmath150 below the mean @xmath75 for fc and intermediate - order configurations .",
    "as mentioned in the main text , an underestimation of @xmath75 is likely to result from the long - tail decay of the structure factor in the bg phase , further supporting the observed structural differences .",

    "this line matches the abrupt change in slope observed in both @xmath49 ( @xmath162 in panel ( b ) ) and @xmath163 ( @xmath164 in panel ( c ) ) , above which no history effects are observed .",
    "the fact that our experiments are performed below the spinodal line indicates that fluctuations are not dominant in the underlying physics .",
    "however , due to the close vicinity , some small influence can not be discarded .",
    "the dotted horizontal line indicates the magnetic field applied in our sans experiment .",
    "the full bulk penetration of the shaking fields , with the consequent vortex displacements in distances larger than @xmath41 , is essential to justify our claim of a bulk dynamic reordering .",
    "the modification of the bulk vl structure factor observed in the sans experiment is the main direct evidence of such a reordering . in this supplementary section , we present some numerical estimations , together with additional experimental results obtained by magnetization and non - linear ac susceptibility measurements , that provide a consistent scenario regarding this crucial issue .",
    "a simple calculation provides a rough estimation of the mean vortex displacement associated with the shaking field penetration . under full ac field penetration ,",
    "the maximum variation of the vl parameter @xmath41 during a cycle of the shaking field is @xmath165 in our sans experiments , @xmath166  oe and @xmath167  koe , so @xmath168  nm . therefore , near the centre of the sample , vortices only need to move short distances @xmath169 to accommodate to the change in the density .",
    "however , the propagation of the density change throughout the sample implies that the mean displacement increases with the distance @xmath170 from the centre as @xmath171 .",
    "consequently , in our experiments we expect @xmath172 for @xmath173  @xmath174 m , reaching @xmath175 as large as several microns near the edge of the sample ( @xmath176 mm ) . in conclusion , during the shaking procedure , most vortices move long distances @xmath177 , allowing a dynamic reorganization . on the other hand , vortices that enter and exit the sample crossing its edge during the shaking procedure",
    "are present only in a thin micrometric annulus near the sample boundary ( less than 2% of the sample area ) and may only marginally affect the average bulk structure .",
    "the claim that the small ac field @xmath178  moe , applied during the linear ac susceptibility measurements , does not modify the vl configuration , i.e. the technique is non - invasive , has been extensively discussed in previous publications @xcite : the linear non - dissipative campbell regime @xcite holds when each vortex performs small harmonic oscillations around a minimum of the effective pinning potential well .",
    "these small oscillations propagate inside the sample up to the campbell penetration depth , generally smaller than the sample dimension . the same reasons outlined above ( replacing @xmath166  oe by @xmath178  moe ) lead to the conclusion that during the ac measurement even outmost vortices move typically less than @xmath179 nm @xmath180 , where @xmath181 is the coherence length , not modifying the vl configuration .",

    "<S> the red boxes in ( b)-(e ) enclose the detector area included in the rcs in figure [ fig4 ] . ]    while shaking the vl at any @xmath56 leads to an ordered configuration , the consequences are strikingly different when the shaking field is applied in the narrow transitional region above @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig3](a ) shows the evolution of @xmath49 through a series of processes near the transitional region ( hatched area ) and figure [ fig4](a ) displays the corresponding rcs . </S>",
    "<S> a strongly pinned fc vl was cooled to @xmath57 and shaken , partially reducing the effective pinning . </S>",
    "<S> the vl was cooled to @xmath45 and a narrow rc , still wider than @xmath58 was measured , indicating a bulk _ </S>",
    "<S> partial ordering_. in contrast , applying the same shaking burst at the same @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) to an initially ordered vl had the opposite effect : the shaking field partially increased the effective pinning to a similar level and _ disordered _ the vl . </S>",
    "<S> the rc was broader than @xmath58 , but narrower than for the maximally disordered fc lattice . because the response after shaking is strongly dependent on the temperature when @xmath61 , the process was carefully repeated within @xmath62 , obtaining the same qualitative results . to rule out that the _ partial disordering _ was of thermal origin , </S>",
    "<S> a warming - cooling cycle up to @xmath59 but without applying the shaking burst was carried out for a replicated ordered vl . although the cooling @xmath49 branch indicates higher pinning than the warming branch , it is lower than for vls shaken above @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , if there was any associated disorder , it was minor and below our sans resolution . therefore , the `` intermediate '' degree of disorder found before is only attributable to the shaking field applied at @xmath59 .    </S>",
    "<S> although the above results are qualitatively evident by simply comparing the corresponding intensity distribution on the position sensitive detector at @xmath63 ( figure [ fig3](b)-(e ) ) , we evaluated the statistical significance of the observed differences ( see appendix ) . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig4](b ) shows the profile likelihood ratio @xmath64 resulting from the fit of each experimental rc to one expected from a configuration with an intrinsic width given by @xmath65 convoluted by the experimental resolution . </S>",
    "<S> correlation lengths obtained after shaking the vl at @xmath59 were @xmath66 at the @xmath67 confidence level . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we state that shaking the vl in the transitional region results in bulk intrinsic configurations with intermediate degree of disorder .    </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) ) , after shaking at @xmath59 a fc ( blue ) and an ordered ( green ) vl , and after warming an ordered vl to @xmath68 without shaking at this temperature ( magenta ) . </S>",
    "<S> curves are fits of lorentzian peaks convoluted by the resolution . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) calculated profile likelihood ratio @xmath69 as a function of @xmath65 up to the sample thickness @xmath70 for each experimental rc . </S>",
    "<S> symbols above the curves indicate the maximum ( @xmath71 ) and error bars , the @xmath72 confidence interval . for the ordered vl , @xmath73 and </S>",
    "<S> is beyond our resolution . </S>",
    "<S> the profile likelihood of replicate rcs of the fc ( black dashed line ) and the one shaken at @xmath74 ( green dashed line ) are reproducible within the error bars . ]    the total integrated intensity @xmath75 ( the area under the rc ) for the different configurations should remain roughly constant . </S>",
    "<S> even so , the long - tail decay of the structure factor in the bg phase may lead to an underestimation of @xmath75 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , for all fc configurations and for the configurations obtained after shaking the vl in the transitional region we observe a similar @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> however , for the lattice shaken in the bg the integrated intensity is slightly , but statistically significant , smaller ( see appendix ) . </S>",
    "<S> these features support a qualitative difference in the positional order decay in the elastic bg configurations and in those obtained after shaking the vl in the transitional region , where disorder is probably mediated by dislocations .    in the elastic bg </S>",
    "<S> , the in - plane correlation length @xmath8 can be derived from @xmath7 through the tilt and shear elastic constants @xmath76 and @xmath77 @xcite . from @xmath78 , </S>",
    "<S> a lower limit of @xmath79 can be estimated for the in plane size of the dislocation - free regions corresponding to the ordered configurations , which is consistent with results obtained in other works in the bg phase @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> how @xmath8 relates to @xmath7 is not as straightforward for metastable vl configurations with dislocations . in theoretical works </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are obtained for equilibrium vl configurations from the densities of screw and edge dislocations that minimize the free energy ; far enough from the amorphous limit ( i.e. , @xmath80 ) dislocation densities adapt in such a way as to satisfy the elastic ratio . moreover , numerical simulations @xcite and experimental results @xcite show that @xmath7 monotonically increases with the in - plane ordering from the plastic to the elastic regime . in our case , </S>",
    "<S> the partially disordered vls are metastable configurations ( at @xmath45 ) which originated from a dynamic reorganization in the vicinity of the odt . in this region </S>",
    "<S> the elastic constants are dispersive and may also be affected by fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , a precise quantitative estimation of @xmath8 from @xmath7 is not available , but a monotonic correlation is still expected ( see appendix for a quantitative estimate ) . </S>",
    "<S> such a correlation would be compatible with an intermediate density of dislocations in partially disordered vls .    </S>",
    "<S> our results show a clear connection between the linear ac response , related to the effective pinning , and the bulk spatial correlation of the vl . </S>",
    "<S> configurations having correlation lengths much larger than the lattice parameter , but small enough to affect the global response , were observed after shaking the vl in the proposed transitional region . </S>",
    "<S> these observations support the existence of such region and represent the first evidence of a dynamic reordering , driven by oscillatory forces , which results in robust bulk configurations with intermediate degrees of disorder . </S>",
    "<S> a similar behavior was obtained in numerical simulations @xcite , where configurations with intermediate dislocation densities are accessible from stationary fluctuating dynamic states , as those proposed for colloids @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the interplay between these spatial configurations and their associated non - linear dynamics remains a fertile ground for further research . </S>"
