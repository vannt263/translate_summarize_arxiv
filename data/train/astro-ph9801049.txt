    "several blazars , all of them associated with radio loud agn , show an intense and variable @xmath0-ray emission ( @xcite ) .",
    "various authors ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) have shown that the observed luminosity  up to @xmath3  ergs  s@xmath4 or more  and variability  typical time scales @xmath5 several hours  can be understood if the emission is due to inverse compton scattering of relativistic electrons on softer photons inside a relativistic jet .",
    "these jets move with bulk lorentz factor @xmath6 , at a distance from the nucleus of order @xmath7 cm : they appear to be the inner part of the well known radio jets , with similar @xmath8 but larger sizes ( 10@xmath9 cm ) .",
    "since the @xmath0-ray emission occurs closer to the central objects , it provides direct information about the physical processes effective in the central region of agn .    in this connection",
    ", the discovery of large ( factor of order 20 ) and very rapid ( time scale around 20 minutes ) variations of the tev emission from mkn  421 on 15 may 1996 ( @xcite ) represents an important clue to the physical conditions in the central region of agn .",
    "variability timescales of 20 minutes would entail a source size @xmath10 cm ( with problems for photon - photon opacity ) or @xmath11 ( with problems for the total energy and the low probability of observing an event with a visibility cone @xmath12 ) .",
    "our purpose in this letter is to present a model for the occurrence of rapid variations which uses the standard scenario but does not require extreme values for the lorentz factor @xmath8 or the size .",
    "the variability is related to anisotropies in the comoving frame of the jet associated with the geometry of the shocks responsible for the particle acceleration .",
    "we shall show that strong spikes in the very high energy spectrum are a natural consequence of a nearly conical shock geometry with characteristic opening @xmath2 .",
    "we shall assume that the jet has a bulk lorentz factor @xmath13 , scale length @xmath14 and radius @xmath15 ; the scale length is defined as the distance over which the bulk properties of the jet change substantially : let @xmath16 be one such property , then @xmath17 .",
    "the observer s line of sight makes an angle @xmath18 to the jet axis .",
    "the time scales relevant to the variability are the following ones , as measured by a distant observer :    1 .   the geometrical time needed to the photons to cross the emission region either in length ( longitudinal time @xmath19 ) or in width ( radial time @xmath20 ) ; 2 .",
    "the radiative time @xmath21 over which the emitting electrons lose a large fraction of their energy ; if @xmath0 is the typical electron lorentz factor in the comoving frame , the dot indicates the time derivative , and the prime refers to quantities measured in the comoving frame , then @xmath22 ; 3 .",
    "the injection time @xmath23 over which the electrons are fed to the emission region ; as will be shown in the following , the radiative time is typically shorter than the geometrical time , and the electrons must be accelerated _ in situ _ ; there are arguments ( @xcite ) which point to the electrons being not only accelerated , but also generated _ in situ_.    from the point of view of the observer , a variability episode appears convolved with @xmath23 , @xmath21 , @xmath24 , and is dominated by the _",
    "longest _ of them .",
    "on the other hand , in a diverging jet the emission mechanisms become very rapidly ineffective over distances longer than @xmath14 , so that @xmath25 is an upper bound to the observed variability @xmath26",
    "@xmath27\\   \\label{eq1}\\ ] ]    there are various arguments which suggest that @xmath28 ; if this is indeed the case , and @xmath29 ( as we shall assume in the following ) , @xmath26 is necessarily of the order of the longitudinal time @xmath25 . in this paper",
    "we show how a plausible geometric arrangement might release this constraint , otherwise unavoidable .",
    "the injection time scale @xmath23 is very likely the shortest of all , of the order of several minutes , depending on the mass one chooses for the central black hole .",
    "the remaining time scales @xmath21 and @xmath30 are related in an interesting way to the jet optical depth to photon - photon absorption .",
    "this is due to the near equality of the cross sections involved , and to the radiation density in the jet being the target for both the emission _ and _ the absorption processes .",
    "the relation can be expressed in closed form under certain assumptions : only the jet contributes to the radiation field , the radiation spectrum is flat in @xmath31 , the scattering process is always in the thomson regime .",
    "then one has @xmath32",
    "the quantity @xmath33 is the compactness of the jet radiation field in terms of the luminosity @xmath34 , @xmath35 is the jet photon - photon optical depth , and @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the upper and lower energies of the photon spectrum , respectively , in units of @xmath38 . by multiplying the second and third of eqs .",
    "[ eq2 ] we finally get    @xmath39    as long as the right hand side is @xmath40 , one can have at the same time @xmath41 and a high radiative efficiency @xmath42 . in certain bl  lacs , however , as for instance mkn  421 , the klein ",
    "nishina regime is reached and @xmath43 ; furthermore , if one requires that the jet is not loaded with too many pairs ( @xcite , @xcite ) , @xmath35 has to be @xmath40 , and a certain degree of fine tuning becomes necessary . in general , however , @xmath44 .",
    "the models which have been fitted to typical @xmath0-ray blazars have by construction @xmath30 equal to the observed variability time scale , which is several hours ; salvati , spada & pacini ( 1996 ) , for instance , in the case of 3c  279 find @xmath45 and @xmath46  cm .",
    "the acceleration of the emitting electrons must occur _ in situ _ , and strong shocks are the most likely location .",
    "the orientation of the shocks with respect to the jet axis is preferentially at angles @xmath47 .",
    "this is seen in numerical simulations ( @xcite , @xcite ) , and is due to arcsin  @xmath48 being the causal angle traced by a perturbation which moves isotropically at speed @xmath49 in the comoving frame .",
    "also , when the flow is deflected by the external medium , angles around @xmath48 are preferred , since at those angles the ram pressure levels off at values close to the internal pressure .",
    "finally , it is plausible that @xmath23 and @xmath21 are much smaller than @xmath30 .",
    "we can envisage a geometry of the emission region similar to fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] : the accelerating shocks are a series of opening and closing cones ; a very thin layer of extra electrons ( the perturbation ) move down the jet with velocity @xmath50 ; they radiate immediately after being accelerated , so that the emission region is a ring at the intersection between the electron layer and the conical shocks ; if the cone opening is precisely @xmath51 , and the line of sight coincides precisely with one generatrix of the cone , the photons emitted in the observer s direction pile up at the same observed time",
    ".    many of these restrictions can be released .",
    "one can assume that the cone opening angle @xmath52 and the viewing angle @xmath53 are different from each other ; then the pile up condition becomes    @xmath54    real solutions exist only if @xmath55 ; when @xmath56 , the pile up effect takes place along _ two _ lines of sight . also , it is not essential that @xmath53 coincides exactly with the pile up value .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the result of viewing angles differing by various amounts from the optimal one .",
    "if @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath14 are cartesian coordinates of the emission ring , with @xmath14 along the jet axis , @xmath59 is the ring radius , @xmath60 is the time , and @xmath61 the time at which a given wavefront reaches the observer , the flux @xmath62 is given by    @xmath63    @xmath64,\\quad y=\\sqrt{s^2-x^2},\\quad z = c\\beta t \\label{5b}\\ ] ]    the curves have been computed with @xmath65 ( where @xmath66 is a number @xmath67 ) , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 hours .",
    "one should note that the vertical axis is logarithmic , and the height of the spikes is very often a factor of several ; one should further note that blazars are observationally selected to have @xmath71 , and the _ a posteriori _ probability of having @xmath72 is relatively large , p(@xmath73 )  =  @xmath74 ; for instance , the sharpest peak shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] should be observable in 19% of the cases .",
    "the peaks appear because the relevant geometry is not the one of the jet as a whole , but instead the one of the emission region , which in the case of strong radiation losses traces the surface of the shocks .",
    "the preferential orientation of this surface results in the radiation field being strongly anisotropic at any point of the emission region at the time of the perturbation ; the peak photons are distributed over an angle much narrower than @xmath48 , of the order of @xmath75 ; the relevant length is the radiative length , instead of the geometrical one , and one has @xmath76 .",
    "both results can be described in terms of an `` effective '' lorentz factor @xmath77 , and explain why at variance with eq .",
    "[ eq1] @xmath78",
    ".    anisotropies in the laboratory frame on scales smaller than @xmath48 are equivalent to the loss of isotropy in the comoving frame , at variance with the standard scenario , and may have interesting consequences .",
    "while the peak photons , as we have found , are very closely aligned , the emitting electrons interact with the same peak photons at angles of the order of @xmath48 ; this breaks the assumptions under which eq .",
    "[ eq3 ] was derived , and allows a situation where _ at the same time _ the radiative losses are very rapid and the pair production opacity is very low . also , if the line of sight is not closely aligned with the shock surface , the observer will infer a photon density at the source _ lower _ than the one experienced by the electrons ; this breaks the assumptions under which synchrotron self compton models are usually computed , and allows larger ratios between the compton and synchrotron regions of the spectrum .",
    "we stress finally that the sharp features carry only a small fraction of the total radiated energy ; most of this energy resides in the long lived , low level tail , which by construction has a time scale of order @xmath30 .",
    "so the observed light curve will exhibit conspicuous sharp features only if the injection events are spaced at intervals @xmath79 ; in the opposite case a given peak will be swamped by the superposition of the many tails of the preceding peaks .    because of the assumption of negligible radiative lifetime , the curves of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] are the green functions of the variability problem for the given set of parameters , and by convolving them with an arbitrary injection function one obtains the general solution .",
    "[ fig3 ] is our best fit by this method to the tev light curve of mkn  421 on 15 may 1996 with the parameters of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and @xmath80 .",
    "it shows that it is not necessary to assume extreme jets to account for extreme variability ; only , similar episodes should not be observed to repeat before times of order @xmath81 several hours .",
    "we recall that mkn  421 was observed to flare with a @xmath82 minute timescale also on 7 may 1996 ( @xcite ) . with a different injection function",
    "we can easily fit this flare as well .",
    "because of the longer duration of the episode , we find that the ratio of the fluxes after and before the flare should have been higher than on 15 may 1996 , but there are no data to check this .",
    "we have developed a model to explain extremely fast variations in the emission of relativistic jets . under the following assumptions :    1 .",
    "the jet has typical parameters ( @xmath45 , @xmath83 cm , @xmath84 hours ) ; 2 .",
    "cold electrons are injected in the center and move outwards with bulk velocity @xmath85 ; 3 .",
    "electrons are accelerated in conical shocks with opening angle @xmath2 ; 4 .",
    "injection time and cooling time are @xmath86 ; 5 .",
    "the viewing angle is @xmath18 ,    it is possible to observe a very short bump @xmath86 , because the component of the peak photons velocity along the jet is near to the electron velocity , and the photons pile up on the wavefront . in particular , we have been able to fit with typical jet parameters the 20  minute tev flare of mkn  421 on 15 may 1996 .",
    "deviations from the ideal geometry could be some curvature in the shocks , or a non - negligible lifetime of the electrons at low energies ; these should result in a certain amount of smoothing , which needs to be computed in detail .",
    "the extension of this model to the case of non - negligible particle lifetime is currently under investigation with the aim of comparing the expected behaviour of the emission at different frequencies .",
    "we may note straight away that in at least one case ( pks  2155304 ) the burst has been seen to evolve with frequency - dependent time scales ( @xcite ) , roughly compatible with synchrotron cooling in a uniform field .",
    "this is possible if @xmath87 ( with far reaching implications on the jet dynamics ) , in a non - standard geometry as the one proposed here .",
