    "indeed , the epos generator which includes such effects can reproduce the p - pb data , however , it fails to describe peripheral pb  pb collisions .",
    "alice has also measured the multiplicity dependence of  for identified particles ( @xmath11 , k , p ) . here , a clear mass ordering @xmath12 is observed @xcite , which is an indication for collective expansion with a common velocity field .    further evidence for collective effects in p ",

    "also the slopes are different and this leads to a crossing - point at around @xmath18 . the same behavior is observed in p  pb collisions ( fig .",

    "alice has measured the nuclear modification factor  for minimum bias p - pb collisions and it is found to be unity for @xmath0  above @xmath19 @xcite . for minimum bias collisions ,  is fixed by the total p  pb and proton  nucleon ( p  n ) cross - sections : @xmath20 . how can  be determined for different centrality classes ? in general ,",
    "centrality is defined via centrality estimators that depend monotonically on the number of collisions , e.g. multiplicity and summed energy in a certain pseudo - rapidity range .",
    "in contrast to pb  pb collisions , for p  pb the multiplicity fluctuations for a fixed  are large with respect to the relatively small range of  ( typically between 1 and 16 ) . the presence of large fluctuations can bias the p ",
    "n collisions themselves .",
    "hence , for each centrality class we have to answer two independent questions : _ what is the mean number of collisions ? _ and _ how much are the p  n collisions biased ?",
    "_ let us start with the answer to the first question .",
    "alice employs various sub - detector systems covering disjunct pseudo - rapidity ranges to estimate the centrality . the number of tracks are reconstructed and counted using its and tpc covering @xmath21 .",
    "clusters are counted in the innermost layers of the its , the silicon pixel detector , in @xmath22 and @xmath23 . a pair of scintillator hodoscopes , vzeroa and vzeroc , measure charged particle multiplicity in the ranges @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively . the zero degree calorimeters ( zdc ) measure forward proton and neutron energies at beam rapidity .",
    "the centrality estimators discussed in this paper are : _",
    "cl1 _ : number of clusters in the 2nd pixel layer , _",
    "v0a _ : the vzeroa multiplicity , _",
    "v0 m _ : the sum of vzeroa and vzeroc multiplicities , _ zna _ : the zdc neutron calorimeter energy in direction of the pb - beam .    using these estimators we are sensitive to the reaction products of p - n collisions , the pb fragmentation products that go mainly in the direction of the pb beam ( _ v0a _ ) and the so called slow nucleons from evaporation and",
    "knock - out that are emitted into the very forward directions and are detected by the zero degree calorimeters . for centrality estimation , particle production in the central part is modeled by negative binomial distributions ( nbd ) and forward slow nucleon production by fragmentation models for evaporation and knock - out @xcite .    as for pb ",
    "pb collisions , in p ",
    "pb , we define centrality classes as percentiles of the multiplicity distributions . in order to extract for each class @xmath26",
    ", we use the glauber fit approach with  as the number of particle sources ( ancestors ) @xcite .",
    "[ fig : ncoll ] shows @xmath27 as a function of centrality for the different estimators .",
    "the variation of @xmath26 between different estimators is small and of similar magnitude as the systematic error obtained by varying the glauber parameters and from a closure test using hijing @xcite simulations .",
    "let us now tackle the second question : _ how biased are p ",
    "n collisions for a given centrality class ?",
    "_ compared to pb ",
    "pb collisions , we find that in p ",
    "pb collisions the correlation between the centrality estimator and  is very loose . in other words the same value of  can contribute to several adjacent centrality classes .",
    "so , what exactly distinguishes two centrality classes for the same ? is this relevant for other physics observables ?",
    "the glauber monte carlo itself can give us an indication on the strength of these biases .",
    "[ fig : bias ] shows the ratio of the generated multiplicity per ancestor to the mean multiplicity of the nbd .",
    "this ratio is constant in case all collisions are unbiased .",
    "what one sees is that in p  pb the ratio is above unity for central collisions and below unity for peripheral collisions , whereas in pb - pb the bias is much smaller and restricted to very peripheral collisions .",
    "also the mean p ",
    "n impact parameter , @xmath28 , can be extracted from the glauber mc . for peripheral collisions , it is larger than the average .",
    "note that in some models large @xmath28 correspond to softer than average interactions .",
    "multiplicity fluctuations described by the nbd have no immediate dynamical interpretation .",
    "however , models based on multi - parton interaction include intrinsically a fluctuating number of particles sources , the hard scatterings .",
    "for example , in hijing @xcite , the mean number of hard scatterings , , for a p ",
    "n collision is obtained from an impact parameter dependent p ",
    "n overlap function , @xmath29 , and the hard cross - section , @xmath30 , via @xmath31 .",
    "the number of scatterings , @xmath32 , itself follows a poissonian distribution @xmath33 .",

    "n collisions is used to scale the reference pp yields and obtain the nuclear modification factor . however",
    ", from the discussion above we have at least two new elements : for a given centrality class , hard processes scale with @xmath34 .",
    "further , for a given p ",
    "pb impact parameter , @xmath35 ,  depends on the average p ",
    "n impact parameter .",
    "this is mainly important for peripheral collisions . here",
    ", the multiplicity estimator acts also as a veto on hard processes which contribute to the overall multiplicity ( jet - veto ) . being aware of this biases we define the observable @xmath36 , which is not equal to , since we do not take into account the bias on the mean number of hard scatterings .",
    "[ fig : qpa ] shows ( @xmath0 ) for the cl1 , v0 m and v0a centrality estimators",
    ". for all centrality classes  strongly deviates from unity at high @xmath0 .",
    "however the spread between different centrality classes reduces when moving from cl1 to v0 m to v0a , increasing the @xmath37-separation between the estimator and the @xmath0  measurement .",
    "the smallest bias is expected for the zna - estimator , the analysis of which is still in progress . for the most peripheral collisions with cl1 , there is a clear indication for a jet veto bias :  has a significant negative slope due to the fact that the contribution of jets to the overall multiplicity increases with @xmath0 .",
    "the slope is reduced for v0 m and absent for v0a .",
    "the cl1 results are compared to a pythia6 @xcite simulation , where  pp - collisions have been superimposed with a probability proportional to the glauber  distribution .",
    "as for the data , the centrality has been obtained from the charged particle multiplicity in @xmath23 and @xmath26 is directly obtained from the monte carlo .",
    "quite surprisingly this simple model can reproduce the large bias at high @xmath0 .",
    "it also agrees with the low-@xmath0  region of the most peripheral collisions and reproduces the jet - veto bias . for all other centralities ,",
    "it does not reproduce the cronin - like enhancement at @xmath38 and the low-@xmath0  region is overestimated .",
    "the latter is expected since in this region also the minimum bias @xmath39 is below unity .    * in summary * , in pp and p - pb a strong increase in  with multiplicity is observed . in models for pp",
    "this is understood as a consequence of color reconnections between strings produced in multiple parton interactions raising the question whether similar effects are at work in p  pb or whether it is the result of collective flow or initial state effects . the @xmath15 coefficients obtained from `` jet''-subtracted identified 2-particle correlations show a mass ordering and crossing of @xmath15 of protons and pions .",
    "the pattern is reminiscent of pb - pb collisions , where this is effects is attributed to hydrodynamic flow .",
    "centrality estimators based on multiplicity measurements in @xmath40 induce a bias on the hardness of the p ",
    "n collisions that can be quantified by the number of hard scatterings per p ",
    "n collision .",
    "low ( high )  multiplicity p ",
    "pb corresponds to lower ( higher ) than average number of hard scatterings .",
    "the comparisons to incoherent superposition of p ",
