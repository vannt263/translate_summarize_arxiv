    "sunspot , faculae and network are manifestations of the solar magnetic field . since earlier observations it is known that the number and position of sunspots varies with a periodicity of approximately 11 years @xcite .",
    "subsequent studies have shown that the area coverage of faculae and network is in general positively correlated with the magnetic activity ( see * ? ? ? * for a recent review ) although in the literature there is some discrepancy in the description of this correlation , mostly because of the different datasets and data processing employed by different authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "several studies showed that the relation between area of facular / network regions identified on chromospheric and photospheric imagery and sunspot area can be described with a linear function ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with the coefficients of the fit being dependent on the strength of the cycle@xcite , while some authors described the relation as quadratic @xcite .",
    "@xcite analyzed the variation of white light faculae using data acquired over nine cycles at the royal greenwich observatory and noticed that the relation between facular / network and sunspot area is linear during the ascending and descending phases of the cycle , while during the maximum it is difficult to find a clear relation , so that the relation seems to be best described with a sigmoid .",
    "those authors also noticed that in certain cycles the area coverage of facular / network regions differs during the ascending and descending phases .",
    "the spatial distribution of magnetic activity is also known to vary in time ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a recent review ) .",
    "magnetic regions emerge as * bipoles * at the beginning of the cycle preferentially at middle latitudes ( @xmath0 30 deg , activity belt ) and then closer to the equator as the cycle proceeds , while advective processes transport the flux of the following polarity preferentially toward the poles ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* for a recent review ) mainly in the form of faculae and network .",
    "as a result , the variation of facular and network coverage over the cycle is also strongly dependent on their latitudinal distribution and the associated magnetic flux intensity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "polar faculae are for instance anti - correlated with the sunspot number ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* for a recent review ) .",
    "the area of faculae is positively correlated with sunspot area and number and their coverage closely follows the latitudinal migration of sunspots . for what concerns the network ,",
    "results are instead still controversial .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite found that , depending on the amount of the associated magnetic flux , the number of network elements can be correlated , anti - correlated , or constant over the activity cycle , with the component positively correlated also being preferentially distributed over the activity belt .",
    "some analysis carried out on ca ii k images indicate that the area coverage of the so called `` quiet '' and `` active '' network are anti - correlated and correlated , respectively , with the magnetic activity cycle ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while some others indicate that the network coverage is always positively correlated ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a recent analysis carried out by @xcite on sub - arcsec spatial resolution g - band data , also indicates that the variation of g - band magnetic bright points observed at disk center is positively correlated with the 11-year cycle .",
    "studies of the variation of facular , network and sunspot coverage over the magnetic cycle are of relevance for solar irradiance studies , as several techniques developed to reproduce measured total and spectral solar irradiation variations make use of observations of variations of the solar surface magnetism @xcite",
    ". records of sunspot number are available since the beginning of the 17th century , while records of facular and network coverages date back to the beginning of the 20th century .",
    "for this reason , some techniques developed to infer long - term ( decades , centuries ) solar irradiance variations make use of the empirical relation between sunspot and facular / network coverage derived from available data ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the ratio between facular and sunspot area is also a parameter employed in models aimed to reproduce the photometric variability of stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "both observational ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and theoretical ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) studies indicate that the radiative emission of magnetic elements is strongly dependent on their angular distance from the center of the solar disk .",
    "moreover , different types of magnetic features , in irradiance studies usually classified according to their magnetic flux ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or their emission in ca ii k ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , are characterized by different photometric properties .    for solar variability studies",
    "it is therefore important to investigate not only the variation of the coverage of faculae and network during the cycle , as has been done in previous studies , but also to discriminate between different types of features and their location over the disk . in this work",
    "we investigate the variation over cycle 23 of the area coverage of magnetic elements characterized by different amount of magnetic flux and located at different distances from disk center .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec.obs ] we describe the dataset analyzed ; in section  [ sec.res ] we present our results and in section  [ sec.noi ] we investigate the effects of noise ; in section  [ sec.concl ] we discuss our results in the light of previous works and we draw our conclusions .",
    "we analyzed a set of 3265 full - disk line - of - sight magnetograms acquired daily between 1996 june 1 and 2011 april 4 with the michelson doppler interferometer ( mdi ) on board the soho space craft @xcite .",
    "the mdi acquires filtergrams in two orthogonally polarized states at five wavelength positions sampling the ni i 676.8 nm line .",
    "the mdi data - products ( intensitygrams , line - depth , line - of - sight velocities and line - of - sight magnetograms ) are obtained by a combination of these filtergrams under the assumption that the shape of the ni i line can be approximated by a gaussian function @xcite .",
    "this assumption causes uncertainties in the estimate of the data - products , especially in presence of large magnetic fields , which , via the zeeman effect , cause broadening and saturation of the line ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for this reason , several efforts have been dedicated to the inter - calibration of mdi line - of - sight magnetograms with data acquired from different instruments ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . in this study",
    "we employ five - minutes level 1.8.2 data , obtained applying the correction factors reported in @xcite , as described in @xcite .    for our analysis we selected magnetic pixels that do not belong to sunspots and where the absolute value of the magnetic flux @xmath1 exceeds the noise threshold , @xmath2 .",
    "this last quantity was defined as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the map of the noise level over the detector .",
    "the map @xmath4 was estimated following a procedure similar to the one described in @xcite .",
    "we considered a set of 50 magnetograms acquired during very quiet days in the period 1996 - 1997 and 2006 - 2011 . for each magnetogram",
    "pixel we computed the standard deviation of magnetic flux values over a running box of @xmath5 pixels ; for pixels closer to the limb the box was reduced to @xmath6 pixels .",
    "note that , to exclude residual activity , the standard deviation over each box was computed using the idl procedure robust_sigma.pro , which employs a `` robust tukey s biweight '' algorithm ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to discard outliers values .",
    "the map @xmath4 was then computed as the average of the maps derived from each magnetogram .",
    "@xcite showed that the noise level of mdi magnetograms slightly increases with time , most likely because of uncertainties in the calibrations after the two periods of loss of contact of the soho spacecraft in 1998 and 1999 .",
    "for this reason we utilized two different noise maps for data acquired before and after 1999 , the first computed from quiet days acquired in the period 1996 - 1997 and the second one computed from quiet days acquired between 2006 and 2011 . in agreement with previous studies , we found that the noise level so defined increases toward the limb , decreases drastically toward the extreme limb , and that a quadrant of the detector shows a systematically higher noise level .",
    "the value of the noise level derived from the 1996 - 1997 data varied between 6 g and 12 g , while the noise level derived from the 2006 - 2011 data varied between 9 g and 18 g .",
    "the effects of the noise on our results are investigated in section  [ sec.noi ] .",
    "the vertical component of the magnetic flux of the pixels exceeding the noise threshold was estimated as the ratio between the measured magnetic flux and the cosine of the heliocentric angle @xmath7 .",
    "sunspot umbrae and penumbrae were then identified by selecting pixels where the magnetic flux @xmath8 is larger than 850 g. isolated pixels were removed applying an `` opening '' operation with a 2-pixels kernel , then the mask was `` dilated '' with a 8-pixels kernel to improve the selection of penumbral pixels .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows an example of the magnetic pixels selected using the described procedure , together with the original magnetogram . as in previous studies ,",
    "the selected features include both network and facular regions .",
    "note that regions where @xmath9 were excluded from the analysis .    in some previous studies that investigated properties of faculae and network regions through the analysis of mdi magnetograms , umbral and penumbral pixels identified on intensitygrams acquired by the mdi and rotated to match the time of observations of the magnetograms",
    "nevertheless , we found that several of the available data were corrupted so that for most of the days the intensitygrams were acquired several hours apart from the magnetograms . to avoid uncertainties due to interpolations when rotating the intensitygrams we therefore decided to analyze magnetograms only . to test the differences between masks obtained with intensitygrams and magnetograms , we compared masks obtained on intensitygrams during days in which intensitygrams and magnetograms acquired less than one hour apart were available .",
    "the mask from the intensitygrams was created by first computing contrast images obtained compensating the intensitygrams for the intensity center to limb variation of quiet pixels , then pixels where the contrast is lower than 0.85 were selected .",
    "the resulting mask was then `` opened '' with a 2-pixels kernel , and `` dilated '' with a 8-pixels kernel .",
    "we found that the masks produced in these two ways are overall similar , as shown by comparing the masks contours lines illustrated in figure[fig1a ] .",

    "for each day we computed the area coverage ( in millionth of the visible solar hemisphere , @xmath10 ) over eight annuli centered at disk center , equally spatied in @xmath7 , of features characterized by different amount of magnetic flux .",
    "note that , unlike in some previous studies , we did not compensate the areas for line - of - sight effects .",
    "the analysis was restricted to features with magnetic flux in the range @xmath11 .",
    "the upper limit value was set by the threshold value employed to define sunspot regions .",

    "being the minimum value of @xmath4 @xmath14 6 g , we found a lowest magnetic field value of @xmath1490 g .",
    "we employed such definition to reduce statistical inhomogeneity at different angular distances that derive from the magnetic flux compensation of line - of - sight effects .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     analysis of the results reported in table  [ tbl-1 ] reveals that the values of the @xmath15 and @xmath16 coefficients of the linear relation are a function of both the position on the disk @xmath7 and the magnetic flux .",
    "this dependence is illustrated in plots in figure  [ fig4 ] , that show the variation of both @xmath16 and @xmath15 with the increase of the magnetic flux for different values of @xmath7 .",
    "the values of @xmath16 and @xmath15 decrease with the increase of the magnetic flux ; in particular , it is worth to note that @xmath15 is significantly different from zero only for @xmath17 .",
    "the value of both coefficients shows instead an overall increase with @xmath7 , although the dependence of @xmath15 on the position over the disk is not strictly monotonous , most likely because of noise effects ( see sec .",
    "[ sec.noi ] ) .",
    "the plots in figure  [ fig3 ] show that , as also found when analyzing the whole dataset , especially close to disk center for a given sunspot number the area of magnetic pixels is higher during the descending phase then during the ascending phase of the magnetic cycle . in this case , the difference is not negligible as the area of magnetic features during the descending phase can be twice the one measured during the ascending phase and it is larger than the uncertainties derived by the fits . in table",
    "[ tbl-3 ] we report results from linear fits to data acquired at disk center ( @xmath18 ) during the ascending ( from 1996 to 2002 ) and descending phase ( from 2002 to 2009 ) , separately . even in this case",
    "second order polynomial fits to the data do not return statistically significant results , while the slopes computed during the descending phase are systematically higher than the slopes computed during the ascending phase .",
    "linear and quadratic fits were then performed on daily data . * for these data the value of the spearman s coefficient , with the exception of few cases , was @xmath19 0.8 .",
    "* we found that , in general , for magnetic flux values larger than 400 g the value returned for @xmath20 by the second order fit is smaller than its uncertainty and the f - test returns a value smaller than the 4.3 threshold confidence level , so that these cases are best represented by a linear function , while for magnetic fluxes smaller than 400 g data are best represented by a quadratic relation with @xmath21 . figure  [ fig31 ] shows for instance the scatter - plots together with the corresponding best - fits for the same cases illustrated in figure  [ fig3 ] . in table",
    "[ tbl-4 ] we report for each position over the disk and for each magnetic range considered only the results obtained for the analytical function that best fits the data , together with the f - test value .",
    "we note that , in agreement with results obtained for 6-month averaged data , the values of @xmath15 and @xmath16 decrease with the increase of the magnetic flux , and that the same trend is found for the absolute value of @xmath20 .",
    "an easy analysis of the values reported in the table shows that the maxima of the quadratic fits shift toward higher sunspot number values with the increase of the magnetic flux , thus suggesting that most likely for magnetic flux values larger than 400 g the data are best represented by a linear relation because we could not observe the maximum of the relation between sunspot number and magnetic pixels area .",
    "the data reported in table  [ tbl-4 ] also show that the values of @xmath16 and the absolute value of @xmath20 increase from the limb toward disk center , while no clear trend is found for @xmath15 .    finally , the plots in figure  [ fig31 ] show no clear difference between results obtained during different phases of the cycle .",
    "the estimate of geometric properties of magnetic features is dependent on the characteristics of the data ( such as spatial resolution , scattered - light level , wavelength of observation ) , their calibration and on the details of the analysis performed . in the context of this study",
    ", @xcite showed that the area of faculae and network identified on ca ii k images depends marginally on the spatial resolution of the data , and largely on the width of the ca ii k filter used for the observations and the intensity threshold criteria employed to define magnetic features .",
    "we therefore repeated previous analysis on data derived employing different magnetic threshold values .",
    "in particular , we compared results obtained with @xmath22 with the cases in which @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and an arbitrary value of @xmath25 constant over the detector . in general",
    ", we found that only the zero order coefficient of the fit , @xmath15 , is somehow affected by the variation of @xmath2 , while the variations of the higher order coefficients are typically within the uncertainties of the fits .",
    "for instance , when considering features located at @xmath26 and @xmath27 we found that @xmath15 computed on 6-month averaged data varies by @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 with respect to results reported in table [ tbl - maincoeffs ] for the cases @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "when restricting the analysis to particular positions on the disk and ranges of magnetic flux values , we found that the smallest magnetic flux values and the positions closest to the limb are the most affected by variation of the noise threshold value .",
    "figure   [ fig5 ] shows for instance the dependence of the daily data quadratic fit coefficients on the value of @xmath2 for various positions over the disk of features whose magnetic flux satisfies @xmath31 .",
    "results obtained for linear fits with the 6-months averaged data are very similar and are not shown .",
    "the plots show that all coefficients are sensitive to the noise threshold .",
    "the general decrease of both @xmath16 and the absolute value of @xmath20 toward the limb with the increase of @xmath2 is the result of the change of the statistic within the magnetic flux and @xmath7 bins considered and the rapid decrease of @xmath16 and @xmath20 with the increase of the magnetic flux .",
    "on the other hand , the small increase of @xmath16 at @xmath32 found for @xmath33 and @xmath34 is most likely the result of the rapid decrease of the noise toward the edges of the solar disk .",
    "moreover , mdi magnetograms acquired before 1998 are known to be slightly defocused , as those data were acquired to favor the focus images acquired in ` high resolution mode'. it is therefore likely that the coverage of magnetic elements is slightly underestimated at the minimum , and consequently the slopes of the fits are slightly overestimated .",
    "the effect is expected to be larger toward the limb ( because of the compensation of the line - of - sight ) and for smaller magnetic flux elements ( which are typically characterized by smaller sizes ) .",
    "in agreement with previous studies carried out on white light and ca ii k images , we found that the relation between facular / network area coverage estimated from magnetograms and the sunspot number is linear on data averaged over 6-months , and is quadratic for daily data . in this last case ,",
    "the fitted function is characterized by a negative concavity , with the maximum reached toward the highest sunspot numbers observed .",
    "when restricting the analysis to particular ranges of magnetic flux and positions over the disk , the 6-month averaged data are still in general best described by a linear relation .",
    "the daily data are instead best described by a quadratic relation with @xmath21 for magnetic flux values smaller than 400 g , while for larger magnetic flux values the best fit is returned by a linear function .",
    "this is most likely due to the fact that the maxima of the fitted quadratic functions shift toward higher sunspot numbers with the increase of the magnetic flux , so that for the larger magnetic flux considered we were able to observe only the rising phase of the relation .    for both 6-months averaged data and daily data , the values of the zero ( @xmath15 ) and first order ( @xmath16 ) coefficients and the absolute value of the second order coefficient ( @xmath20 ) , decrease with the increase of the magnetic flux .",
    "the values of @xmath16 and the absolute value of @xmath20 increase from the limb toward disk center in all cases . instead , the value of @xmath15 increases from the limb toward disk center when considering linear fits of 6-months averaged data , while no clear dependence on the position over the disk is found for fits performed over daily data .    our results also indicate that for the 6-months averaged data the facular / network and sunspot coverage relation is different during the ascending and the descending phases of the cycle . * in particular , for a given sunspot number the facular area during the descending phase is larger than during the ascending phase .",
    "this is most likely consequence of the increase of magnetic field dispersal effects during the descending phase .",
    "* the difference is within statistical uncertainties when considering all the magnetic features singled out on the magnetograms , but becomes statistically significant when restricting the analysis to features located toward disk center , independently on their magnetic flux .",
    "variations of the ratio between facular / network and sunspot areas singled out on ca ii k images were also found during cycle 23 by @xcite , although those authors ascribed them to a numerical effects due to the decrease of the sunspot area during the periods of minima .",
    "instead @xcite , by the analysis of white light faculae , found differences between the two phases , although different cycles showed differences of opposite sign between the ascending and the descending phases . on the contrary , daily data do not show any clear dependence on the phase of the magnetic cycle .",
    "@xcite showed that the different relations between facular / network and sunspot areas obtained on yearly and daily data ( binned over sunspot area ) is the result of the different life - times of faculae and big sunspots .",
    "observations show indeed that the life - time of faculae increases with the increase of the area of the region at the `` time of maximum development '' , while the life - time of sunspots shows a saturation at areas larger than 1000 @xmath10 @xcite , so that the decrease of facular area observed at the largest sunspot areas on the daily data is compensated for in the yearly averaged data .",
    "@xcite also pointed out that the daily data describe best the facular - sunspot area relation close to the emergence of the magnetic flux , which is most likely the reason why the results we obtained on daily data do not show the differences between the ascending and descending phases of the cycle that we observed instead for the 6-month averaged data .    in the framework of solar irradiance studies , it is interesting to note that for all magnetic flux values considered the area of magnetic features located at disk center increases more rapidly than the area of magnetic features located toward the limb",
    "this is illustrated for instance in figure  [ fig6 ] , which shows the variation with the position @xmath7 of the annual average of features characterized by a magnetic flux value between 100 and 200 g .",
    "the rapid increase of magnetic features area toward disk center is due to the larger fraction of the activity belt included in areas close to disk center rather than toward the limb .",
    "a small excess is also found toward the limb but , although it would be tempting to interpret this result as consequence of the migration of the magnetic field toward the poles , we showed in sec .",
    "[ sec.noi ] that this is most likely an effect of the non - uniformity of the noise toward the edge of the solar disk .",
    "because the emission of magnetic features is strongly dependent on the line - of - sight , this result does not necessarily imply that solar irradiance variability is dominated by variations of coverage of features located at disk center .",
    "in a recent study @xcite employed results from magneto hydrodynamic simulations of the solar photosphere to investigate the contribution of magnetic features to irradiance variations in visible and infrared continua employing a simple model in which magnetic features are uniformly distributed over the activity belt .",
    "* we plan to repeat that investigation employing the distributions of magnetic elements obtained in this study .",
    "*    it is important to note that the radiative emission of magnetic features is not only characterized by their magnetic flux , but also by their degree of aggregation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and by the properties of the surrounding plasma @xcite . it would be therefore important to repeat the present analysis discriminating between pixels located in active or quiet regions and characterized by various degree of aggregation .    finally ,",
    "because previous studies indicate that the area distribution of faculae and network also depends on the strength of the cycle , and to investigate further the differences between the ascending and the descending phases , we plan to extend the present analysis to datasets acquired during different cycles .",
