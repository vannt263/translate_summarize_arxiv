    "the no - hair theorem establishes the remarkable property of general - relativistic black holes that their spacetimes and hence all of their characteristics are uniquely determined by precisely three parameters : their mass , spin , and charge ( israel 1967 , 1968 ; carter 1971 , 1973 ; hawking 1972 ; robinson 1975 ; mazur 1982 ) .",
    "the spacetimes of such black holes are described by the kerr - newman metric ( newman et al .",
    "1965 ) , which reduces to the kerr metric ( kerr 1963 ) in the case of uncharged black holes .",
    "this theorem relies on the cosmic censorship conjecture ( penrose 1969 ) as well as on the physically reasonable assumption that the exterior metric is free of closed timelike loops .",
    "if these requirements are met , then all astrophysical black holes should be described by the kerr metric .",
    "black holes are commonly believed to be the final states of the evolution of sufficiently massive stars at the end of their lifecycle .",
    "the gravitational collapse of such stars leads to the formation of a black hole ( oppenheimer & snyder 1939 ; penrose 1965 ) , and any residual signature of the progenitor other than its mass and spin are radiated away by gravitational radiation ( price 1972a , 1972b ) .",
    "this scenario provides an astrophysical mechanism with which kerr black holes can be generated .",
    "almost all nearby galaxies harbor dark objects of high mass and compactness at their center ( kormendy & richstone 1995 ) including our own galaxy ( ghez et al .",
    "2008 ; gillessen et al .",
    "2009 ) providing strong evidence that black holes are realized in nature .",
    "in addition , the measurement of the orbital parameters of many galactic binaries supports the claim that they contain stellar - mass black holes ( e.g. , mcclintock & remillard 2006 ) .    despite the large amount of circumstantial evidence",
    ", there has been no direct proof , so far , for the existence of an actual event horizon .",
    "an event horizon , one of the most striking predictions of general relativity , is a virtual boundary that causally disconnects the interior of a black hole from the exterior universe .",
    "the presence of an event horizon in black - hole candidates has only been inferred indirectly , either from the properties of advection dominated accretion flows or from the lack of observations of type i x - ray bursts ( narayan , garcia , & mcclintock 1997 , 2001 ; narayan & heyl 2002 ; mcclinock , narayan , & rybicki 2004 ; broderick et al . 2009 ; see discussion in psaltis 2006 ) .    the alternative hypothesis that these dark compact objects are not described by the kerr metric but perhaps by a solution of the einstein equations with a naked singularity ( e.g. , manko & novikov 1992 ) and",
    ", therefore , violate the no - hair theorem , is still possible within general relativity .",
    "alternatively , these dark objects might be stable stellar configurations consisting of exotic fields ( e.g. , boson stars , friedberg , lee , & pang 1987 ; gravastars , mazur & mottola 2001 ; black stars , barcel et al .",
    "finally , the fundamental theory of gravity may be different from general relativity in the strong - field regime , and the vacuum black - hole solution might not be described by the kerr metric at all ( e.g. , yunes & pretorius 2009 ; sopuerta & yunes 2009 ; c.f .",
    "psaltis et al .",
    "2008 ) . as a result",
    ", testing the no - hair theorem allows us not only to verify the identification of dark compact objects in the universe with kerr black holes but to test the strong - field predictions of general relativity , as well .",
    "the exterior spacetime of a black - hole candidate is usually best described in terms of its multipole moments .",
    "the mass and the spin of a black hole can be identified as the first two such moments . as a consequence of the no - hair theorem ,",
    "mass and spin already specify all higher multipole moments of a black - hole spacetime completely . therefore",
    ", measuring three independent multipole moments of the spacetime around a black hole suffices to test the no - hair theorem ( ryan 1995 ) .",
    "recent advances in instrumentation have opened new horizon towards probing in detail the immediate vicinity of black holes .",
    "very - long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) has allowed us to observe the first images of the inner accretion flows of black holes and revealed evidence for sub - horizon scale structures ( doeleman et al .",
    "the international x - ray observatory ( ixo ) will measure the detailed profiles of relativistically broadened iron lines in agn ( see , e.g. , brenneman et al . 2009 ) .",
    "moreover , the laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) will probe supermassive black holes near their event horizons via extreme mass - ratio inspirals ( emris ) ( see , e.g. , hughes 2006 ) .    on the theoretical front",
    ", several approaches have been developed to date in order to extract information about black - hole spacetimes with gravitational - wave observations .",
    "this can be done by analyzing several observables that are parametrized as functions of the multipole moments ( ryan 1995 ) .",
    "it requires a suitable choice of the metric that either allows for a determination of multipole moments of order @xmath0 ( glampedakis & babak 2006 ; gair , li , & mandel 2008 ) or of metric perturbations ( collins & hughes 2004 ; vigeland & hughes 2010 ) .",
    "the principles of a general algorithm for stationary axisymmetric vacuum spacetimes that admit full integrability of the geodesic equations have been outlined by brink ( 2008 ; 2009 and references therein ) .    in this series of papers ,",
    "we investigate a framework for testing the no - hair theorem with observations in the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "we formulate our tests in terms of a quasi - kerr metric ( glampedakis & babak 2006 ) that incorporates an independent quadrupole moment but reduces smoothly to the familiar kerr metric when the deviation at the quadrupole order is set to zero .",
    "the central object constitutes a quasi - kerr black hole ( similar to the term bumpy black hole coined by collins & hughes 2004 ) : it deviates from the kerr metric in ( at least ) one multipole moment and allows for a test that distinguishes a kerr black hole from a different type of object .",
    "we compute observables that can be measured directly with either current or near - future instruments and allow for the extraction of at least three independent multipole moments .",
    "this approach allows for a two - fold test : if the central object is indeed a black hole , a deviation from the kerr metric must be zero . if , however , the deviation is measured to be nonzero , then it either has to be a different type of object or general relativity itself breaks down in the strong - field regime very close to the black hole ( c.f . , collins & hughes 2004 ; hughes 2006 ) .    in particular , our framework will enable us to perform a test of the no - hair theorem with the measurement of black - hole images , relativistically broadened iron lines emitted from accretion disks , and the measurement of the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) from the continuum disk spectra .",
    "all of these observables depend explicitly on the multipole moments of the spacetime . under the assumption that the compact objects are kerr black holes ,",
    "these observables have been used to measure the spins of the black holes ( e.g. , zhang , cui , & chen 1997 ; brenneman & reynolds 2006 ; broderick et al .",
    "2009 ) . in the more general case ,",
    "their properties and respective shapes likewise can be used to constrain the quadrupole moments .",
    "similar approaches have been suggested based on timing observations of pulsar black hole binaries ( wex & kopeikin 1999 ) and on observations of stellar orbits in the vicinity of sgr a * ( will 2008 ; merritt et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in section  2 we briefly summarize techniques to measure deviations from the kerr metric and to extract multipole moments of a given black - hole spacetime .",
    "we develop our framework for a test of the no - hair theorem in section  3 and analyze various relevant properties of the underlying quasi - kerr metric in section  4 .",
    "in this section , we first discuss multipole expansions of curved spacetimes in general before we focus on the special nature of the kerr metric",
    ". then we briefly review four approaches to extracting observationally the spacetime parameters of a black hole .",
    "symmetric systems in flat space are often best described by a set of multipole moments . in theories of gravity like general relativity ,",
    "however , space is curved due to the presence of matter , and the resulting field equations are highly non - linear .",
    "it is , therefore , not immediately obvious that such a spacetime can actually be characterized by a set of multipole moments .    in newtonian gravity ,",
    "the potential @xmath1 satisfies the laplace equation @xmath2 where @xmath3 is newton s constant , and @xmath4 is the mass density .",
    "therefore , the potential @xmath1 can always be expanded in spherical harmonics @xmath5 as @xmath6 with mass multipole moments @xmath7 in these expressions , we have left the gravitational constant @xmath3 explicit .",
    "we will set this constant as well as the speed of light @xmath8 to unity for the remainder of this paper .",
    "in the curved space of general relativity , however , the vacuum einstein equations @xmath9 have to be solved for the spacetime metric @xmath10 with the corresponding ricci tensor @xmath11 and ricci scalar @xmath12 .",
    "the einstein equations are nonlinear and , therefore , can not always be solved in terms of an expansion over orthonormal polynomials .",
    "nonetheless , it can be shown that a multipole expansion of curved spacetime does indeed exist ( see thorne 1980 for a detailed review ) .",
    "for an asymptotically flat vacuum solution of the einstein equations , ( tensor ) multipole moments can be defined based on a conformal compactification of 3-space , if the spacetime is also static ( geroch 1970 ) or , more generally , if it is stationary ( hansen 1974 ) . in both cases ,",
    "such a set of multipole moments characterizes the spacetime uniquely ( beig & simon 1980 , 1981 ; see also hauser & ernst 1981 and references therein ) and obeys an appropriate convergence condition ( bckdahl & herberthson 2006 ) .",
    "if the spacetime is also axisymmetric , the multipole moments are given by a bi - infinite series of scalars @xmath13 and @xmath14 , which are interpreted as mass and current multipole moments , respectively .",
    "the mass multipole moments are analogous to the multipole moments in newtonian gravity given by expression ( [ newtonmult ] ) and are nonzero only for even @xmath15 .",
    "the current multipole moments are nonzero only for odd @xmath15 and arise from the fact that , in general relativity , all forms of energy gravitate ( hansen 1974 ) .",
    "stationary axisymmetric vacuum solutions of the einstein equations can likewise be generated from a given set of multipole moments ( sibgatullin 1991 ; manko & sibgatullin 1993 ) .    in general relativity , black - hole spacetimes are asymptotically flat vacuum solutions of the einstein equations .",
    "these spacetimes must also be axisymmetric ( hawking 1972 ) and can therefore be described by a sequence of multipole moments @xmath16 . as a consequence of the no - hair theorem ,",
    "the kerr spacetime is the unique black - hole solution within general relativity that contains an event horizon , and all multipole moments of order @xmath0 are determined only by the first two , i.e. , by the mass @xmath17 and the spin @xmath18 .",
    "this fact can be expressed mathematically with the relation ( geroch 1970 ; hansen 1974 ) @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the dimensionless spin parameter .    in the astrophysical context , the fact that the no - hair theorem requires the multipole moments to be locked by expression ( [ kerrmult ] ) allows for it to be tested quantitatively using observations of black holes . since the first two multipole moments ( i.e. , the mass and spin ) already specify the _ entire _",
    "spacetime , any observable can ultimately depend only on those two moments .",
    "therefore , a promising strategy for testing the no - hair theorem is to measure ( at least ) three multipole moments of the spacetime of a black hole ( ryan 1995 ) .      to date ,",
    "four approaches to testing the no - hair theorem have been suggested that are based on either a multipole expansion or a perturbation of the kerr spacetime . in the following , we briefly review these methods in order to identify the one that is most suitable for our purposes .    the idea to `` map '' the spacetime of an astrophysical black hole and , therefore , to directly measure its multipole moments",
    "was first developed by ryan ( 1995 ) .",
    "he used an expansion in geroch - hansen multipoles in order to design a detection mechanism that could , in principle , probe the spacetime of a black hole using extreme mass - ratio inspiral ( emri ) observations .",
    "he showed that the values of the multipoles are encoded in several observables that can be measured by future experiments .",
    "in particular , these values can be extracted from the evolution of the orbital phase of inspiraling objects ( by , e.g. , x - ray timing missions ) or from the gravitational wave spectrum using lisa ( ryan 1995 , 1997a , 1997b ) .",
    "ryan ( 1995 ) considered a spacetime that is stationary , axisymmetric , and asymptotically flat .",
    "the inspiraling object moves gradually along a family of geodesic orbits in the equatorial plane and radiates away its energy and angular momentum adiabatically .",
    "the metric takes the form ( papapetrou 1953 ) @xmath21 , \\label{papapetrou}\\ ] ] using cylindrical weyl coordinates ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the functions @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 depend on the coordinates @xmath4 and @xmath26 and can be generated from the ernst potential ( ernst 1968 ) @xmath27 the function @xmath28 can be expanded as ( fodor , hoenselaers & perjs 1989 ) @xmath29 which specifies @xmath30 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath31 are directly related to the multipole moments of the spacetime given by the metric in expression ( [ papapetrou ] ) .",
    "the remaining functions @xmath32 and @xmath33 are then obtained in the form of two integrals ( dietz 1984 ; wald 1984 , pp .",
    "165 - 67 ) .",
    "barack & cutler ( 2004 ; 2007 ) used approximate waveforms to extend ryan s analysis for generic orbits and included modulations caused by lisa satellites .",
    "li & lovelace ( 2008 ) generalized ryan s approach to include tidal coupling between the inspiraling and the central object .",
    "one might interject at this point ( see also collins & hughes 2004 ) that a @xmath34-expansion such as the one exhibited by equation ( [ xitilda ] ) spoils the promise of an approach that is based on the multipole moments of the spacetime .",
    "the potential difficulty is that a large number of such moments will be required to describe the spacetime as one approaches the event horizon .    in an alternative approach ,",
    "collins & hughes ( 2004 ) constructed spacetimes of perturbed schwarzschild black holes ( bumpy black holes ) .",
    "these spacetimes have the usual symmetries of being stationary , axisymmetric , and asymptotically flat , and the black hole is effectively perturbed by the presence of additional fields exterior to the black - hole horizon . for these configurations collins & hughes ( 2004 ) calculated the periapse precession of equatorial orbits and found a significant ( factor @xmath35 ) increase of the precession in the strong - field regime .",
    "their starting point was the weyl metric ( weyl 1918 ) @xmath36 which is identical to the metric ( [ papapetrou ] ) with the substitutions @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the quantities @xmath39 and @xmath24 are solutions to the vacuum einstein equations ( collins & hughes 2004 ; see also suen , price & redmount 1988 )",
    ".    then collins & hughes ( 2004 ) introduced small perturbations as @xmath40 and @xmath41 , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the corresponding expressions of the schwarzschild metric , and solved the einstein equations keeping only leading order terms in the perturbation .",
    "( note that this technique does not make explicit use of the multipole moments . )",
    "this approach was recently generalized by vigeland & hughes ( 2010 ) who considered similar perturbations in the metric of rotating black holes .",
    "a third approach is based on the manko - novikov metric ( manko & novikov 1992 ) .",
    "this metric is stationary , axisymmetric , and asymptotically flat and is also a solution of the vacuum einstein equations .",
    "it is a parametric extension of the kerr metric with a different set of multipole moments . in this metric , mass and current multipole moments",
    "are coupled .",
    "in addition to the usual first two moments , i.e. , mass and spin , the mass multipole moments of order @xmath0 are free parameters .",
    "they in turn specify the current multipole moments . in general",
    ", this metric has no event horizon but contains a naked singularity at the center ( manko & novikov 1992 ) .",
    "gair et al .",
    "( 2008 ) studied a subclass of the manko - novikov metric analyzing possible observational signatures of ergodic non - kerr emris .",
    "apostolatos , lukes - gerakopoulos , & contopoulos ( 2009 ) showed that the appearance of birkhoff chains in the neighborhood of resonant tori ( due to the poincar - birkhoff theorem , poincar 1912 ; birkhoff 1913 ) would lead to such a modification of a gravitational - wave measurement .",
    "finally , in a fourth approach , glampedakis & babak ( 2006 ) considered perturbations of the kerr metric that still satisfy the vacuum einstein equations by exploiting the properties of the hartle - thorne metric ( hartle 1967 ; hartle & thorne 1968 ) .",
    "this metric , in hartle - thorne coordinates , describes the spacetime outside any slowly rotating compact object within general relativity and was originally designed for neutron stars .",
    "it provides an expansion of a general spacetime up to the quadrupole order and has a quadrupole moment @xmath44 that is independent of both mass and spin ( hartle & thorne 1968 ) .",
    "glampedakis & babak ( 2006 ) constructed a quasi - kerr extension to the kerr metric by choosing the ( dimensionless ) quadrupole moment to be @xmath45 , where @xmath46 parametrizes a potential deviation from the kerr metric and @xmath47 . in this parametrization , the quadrupole moment is given by ( glampedakis & babak 2006 ) @xmath48 we verified explicitly that this metric is a solution of the vacuum einstein equations up to the quadrupole order by showing that the ricci tensor vanishes .",
    "the quasi - kerr metric is stationary , axisymmetric , and asymptotically flat and reduces to the kerr metric in the limit @xmath49 .",
    "the particular choice of boyer - lindquist coordinates by glampedakis & babak ( 2006 ) is convenient , because it preserves the special petrov - type d character of the kerr part .",
    "similar approaches have also been analyzed in the context of neutron stars ( laarakkers & poisson 1999 ; berti & stergioulas 2004 ) , rigidly rotating stars ( bradley & fodor 2009 ) , and naked singularities ( bini et al .",
    "2009 ) .    for equatorial orbits in the quasi - kerr metric , glampedakis & babak ( 2006 ) calculated the periastron precession and constructed ` kludge ' gravitational waveforms as a function of the parameter @xmath46 .",
    "these waveforms can be significantly different from the expected kerr signal even for small changes of the quadrupole moment .",
    "they identified , however , a confusion problem , because it is possible to match quasi - kerr waveforms of one set of orbital parameters with the kerr template of a different set of orbital parameters .",
    "the fact that the quasi - kerr metric is a valid solution of the einstein equations even for non - kerr values of the quadrupole moment allows us to design a self - consistent test of the no - hair theorem and of the nature of the compact object within general relativity .",
    "a disadvantage of the quasi - kerr metric is the restriction that it can not be used for a description of rapidly spinning black holes .",
    "the most promising approach will be , of course , to perform the tests of the no - hair theorem with all of the above parametrizations of spacetime in order to explore the robustness of the results . nonetheless , the fact that the quasi - kerr metric contains an independent quadrupole multipole moment makes it a natural and well - suited environment for a test of the no - hair theorem , which we adopt below .",
    "in this section , we formulate our framework for testing the no - hair theorem with observations of black holes in the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "we use the quasi - kerr metric ( glampedakis & babak 2006 ) as the underlying spacetime and develop a method from which we derive observables parametrized by an independent quadrupole moment that is potentially different from the value predicted by the no - hair theorem .",
    "we name the central object described by such a metric a quasi - kerr black hole ( similar to the term bumpy black hole , c.f .",
    "collins & hughes 2004 ) .",
    "this is a black hole within general relativity only if the deviation of all its multipole moments from the respective values in the kerr spacetime are zero .",
    "similarly to the case of emri observations ( collins & hughes 2004 ; hughes 2006 ) , our approach may constitute a null - hypothesis test : if the central object is indeed a general - relativistic black hole , then it must have the multipole structure of the kerr metric given by relation ( [ kerrmult ] ) .",
    "if a deviation of the multipole moments from this expression is detected , the object can not be a general - relativistic black hole . in that case , the object is either a star or , if it is otherwise known to posess an event horizon , a black hole with a different set of multipole moments , which , therefore , violates the no - hair theorem .",
    "contrary to gravitational - wave analyses , however , which rely explicitly on the einstein equations , our framework requires only the metric and the einstein equivalence principle .",
    "thus , it can also be viewed as a self - consistent test of general relativity in the strong - field regime .    in the following , we specify the exact form of the quasi - kerr spacetime and we estimate its range of applicability",
    ". this metric has three independent multipole moments ( mass , spin , and quadrupole moment ) .",
    "the deviation of the quadrupole moment from the kerr value is written in terms of the dimensionless parameter @xmath46 , so that the full quadrupole moment is given by relation ( [ qradmoment ] ) .    in boyer - lindquist coordinates",
    ", the kerr metric @xmath50 takes the form ( e.g. , bardeen , press , & teukolsky 1972 ) @xmath51 @xmath52 with @xmath53 @xmath54    the quadrupolar correction is determined by choosing a quadrupole moment of the form ( [ qradmoment ] ) in the hartle - thorne metric ( hartle & thorne 1968 ) .",

    "note that , although only the quadrupole moment of the spacetime has been altered , the unperturbed spacetime is formally correct up to the maximum value of the spin .    in the case of the regular kerr metric ( in boyer - lindquist coordinates ) ,",
    "its petrov - type d character ensures the existence of four constants of motion : the particle rest mass @xmath64 , its energy @xmath65 , the angular momentum about the z - axis @xmath66 , and the carter constant ( carter 1968 ) .",
    "equivalently , the hamilton - jacobi equation is separable in all four coordinates , i.e. , time @xmath67 , radius @xmath68 , and angles @xmath69 and @xmath70 , and the equations of motion are reduced to quadratures ( see , e.g. , chandrasekhar 1983 ) .",
    "this special property greatly simplifies the analysis of a variety of astrophysical applications in the kerr geometry .",
    "the quasi - kerr metric in contrast admits full separability of the hamilton - jacobi equation only for equatorial orbits . for generic orbits , the carter constant",
    "an approximate solution can be found in the neighborhood of the central object using the action - angle formalism of canonical perturbation theory ( glampedakis & babak 2006 ) .",
    "unfortunately , this is no longer possible for trajectories that escape to infinity , such as those of photons that reach a distant observer .",
    "consequently , the equations of motion have to be solved numerically .",
    "berti et al .",
    "( 2005 ) pointed out quantitatively how a deviation from the kerr quadrupole moment alters the petrov type of a spacetime .    before embarking into the study of the properties of the quasi - kerr metric that are relevant for observational tests of the no - hair theorem , it is important to check that the multipole expansion of the metric is well - behaved at small radii . an approach based on a multipole expansion breaks down in the limit @xmath71 , and a higher number of multipole moments must be kept in order for the expansion to accurately describe the black - hole spacetime near the event horizon ( ryan 1995 ; collins & hughes 2004 ) .",
    "the spacetime at horizon scales , however , is most interesting for tests of the no - hair theorem . in the following",
    ", we estimate the range of validity of the quasi - kerr metric .",
    "a formal bound on the multipole moments of stationary spacetimes can be found in bckdahl & herberthson ( 2006 ) , but this is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the validity of the expansion of the metric considered above breaks down at a critical radius @xmath72 that depends both on the spin @xmath73 and the parameter @xmath46 .",
    "this cutoff occurs at the radius at which terms of order @xmath74 and @xmath75 can no longer be neglected against the correction terms proportional to @xmath46 .",
    "unfortunately , these higher order terms can not be calculated uniquely in the approach of glampedakis and babak ( 2006 ) . in the kerr metric",
    ", the expansion of the diagonal elements in the spin parameter @xmath73 has nonvanishing corrections only at order @xmath76 .",
    "these terms are always smaller ( in magnitude ) than the terms at order @xmath77 for @xmath78 and are negligible at radii @xmath79 .",
    "therefore , in order to estimate the value of the critical radius @xmath72 , we compare the quadrupolar correction terms of order @xmath46 in the quasi - kerr metric given by expression ( [ qkerr ] ) to the respective elements of the kerr metric in expression ( [ kerr ] ) up to the quadrupole order .",
    "the metric element which is affected most by the correction that is linear in the parameter @xmath46 is @xmath80 . in figure  1 , we plot the radius at which the absolute value of the quadrupolar correction equals ( solid lines ) the absolute value of the kerr element @xmath81 up to order @xmath77 as a function of the spin @xmath73 . at this radius ,",
    "the element @xmath80 changes sign if @xmath82 .",
    "this unphysical property renders the metric non - lorentzian and leads to a reflection of infalling particles .",
    "we estimate the cutoff @xmath72 as the radius at which the absolute value of the quadrupolar correction equals @xmath83 of the absolute value of the kerr element @xmath81 up to order @xmath77 ( figure  1 , dashed lines ) .",
    "note that these validity constraints are necessary but not sufficient .",
    "[ validity ]    the excluded domain @xmath84 lies inside the circular photon orbit of the kerr metric for @xmath85 and @xmath86 ( c.f .",
    ", bardeen et al . 1972 ) .",
    "therefore , in the quasi - kerr metric , we expect the fraction of photons from this region that reach an observer at infinity to be negligible .",
    "the only exception are photons from further out in the accretion disk that are strongly lensed by the black hole and approach the event horizon closely .",
    "while higher order terms of the spin @xmath73 in the quasi - kerr metric are negligible for values of the radius @xmath79 , this may not be the case for terms of order @xmath75 if the spin parameter @xmath73 is too large .",
    "we will , therefore , limit our discussion to values of the spin @xmath87 . for black holes with this amount of spin and a value of the parameter @xmath88 ,",
    "the critical radius @xmath84 is comparable to the radius of the circular photon orbit in the kerr metric .",
    "an additional complication arises from a singularity at @xmath89 .",
    "this singularity is a relic of the expansion in the hartle - thorne metric .",
    "it vanishes in the kerr metric , where all divergences cancel , hence illustrating the peculiar nature of that metric .",
    "since the singularity is located at @xmath90 , it plays only a very minor role in the following discussion .",
    "it does , however , effect the estimate of the critical radius @xmath72 and therefore would make a different choice of the coordinates desirable .    technically speaking ,",
    "our estimate for the critical radius @xmath72 is only valid for the elements of the quasi - kerr metric @xmath55 , but not for its derivatives . in the case of large quadrupolar corrections , @xmath91",

    "general - relativistic black holes must have the multipole structure of the kerr metric .",
    "if a different set of multipoles is detected , then the compact object can not be a black hole within general relativity .",

    "we identified several observational approaches within our framework that will test the no - hair theorem within the next few years . among these are imaging observations of accretion flows around black holes and , especially , sgr a * using vlbi techniques , as well as the precise measurements of the spectra of iron lines and accretion disks from agn with ixo . in the following papers we will explore in detail the prospects of testing the no - hair theorem with such observations .",

    "<S> we analyze in detail the properties of this quasi - kerr spacetime that are critical to interpreting observations of black holes and demonstrate their dependence on the spin and quadrupole moment . in particular , we show that the location of the innermost stable circular orbit and the gravitational lensing experienced by photons are affected significantly at even modest deviations of the quadrupole moment from the value predicted by the no - hair theorem . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that observations of black - hole images , of relativistically broadened iron lines , as well as of thermal x - ray spectra from accreting black holes will lead in the near future to an experimental test of the no - hair theorem . </S>"
