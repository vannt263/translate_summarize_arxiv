    "reports of discoveries of exotic baryons , @xmath0@xcite and @xmath2@xcite , started intensive discussions on various possibilities of bound pentaquark states .",
    "existence of the @xmath0 , in particular , has been confirmed by several groups@xcite .",
    "this is a baryon with strangeness @xmath7 and therefore can not be made of three quarks .",
    "the minimal quark content of @xmath0 is @xmath8 , and thus it is called `` pentaquark '' .",
    "properties of the new baryons have not yet been determined fully .",
    "the most essential properties are spin and parity .",
    "predictions by the chiral soliton model@xcite and various quark models@xcite claimed a @xmath9 state of @xmath0 , while constituent quark model with all the five quarks sitting in the lowest energy level predicts a negative parity ground state , @xmath10@xcite .",
    "( the other possible spin is @xmath11 , but most of the dynamical quark models , that can reproduce spectra of ordinary hadrons , predict that lower spin states have lower masses . ) furthermore , majority of qcd - based calculations , such as qcd sum rule@xcite and lattice qcd@xcite , indicate that the positive parity state has a higher mass .",
    "there is , however , a strong argument that makes the positive parity state favorable .",
    "the observed width of @xmath0 decaying into @xmath12 scattering states seems very small , i.e. , likely to be less than 20 mev .",
    "it is hard to understand this small width if the parity of @xmath0 is negative , because it then decays into a @xmath12 s - wave state .",
    "recent calculation@xcite shows that @xmath10 state should have a width of order a few hundred mev , while @xmath9 state may have much smaller width due mainly to the suppression by the centrifugal barrier .",
    "several possibilities to reduce the mass of the positive parity state have been proposed in literatures@xcite . among them , proposals of exotic clustering of a diquark or tri - quark inside the pentaquark system are popular .",
    "for instance , jaffe and wilczek@xcite proposed a structure of the pentaquark as a bound state of two scalar @xmath13 diquarks and @xmath14 . because of the color structure and the bose symmetry of diquarks , this bound state has to have a nonzero angular momentum , @xmath15 , between the diquarks and thus the resulting @xmath0 has positive parity .    under these circumstances , it is important to study contributions of various different quark dynamics to the pentaquark states in detail .",
    "the constituent quark model has several important dynamical ingredients , among which we here consider confinement , perturbative one - gluon exchange interaction and nonperturbative instanton induced interaction .",
    "the first one has an obvious role , that is , to confine quarks inside a color singlet hadron . in the nonrelativistic quark models , a confinement potential of a linear form",
    "is often used .",
    "its main role is to give localized wave functions of quarks in the hadron .",
    "however , the confinement mechanism for pentaquarks has not been fully understood in potential quark models , while the confinement potential was calculated in lattice qcd@xcite in the heavy quark limit .",
    "the mit bag model@xcite gives another picture of confinement , that is , quarks are confined by the bag pressure at the bag surface .",
    "the bag is a cavity of perturbative vacuum in the nonperturbative vacuum of qcd and thus has a larger volume energy .",
    "this energy difference between the outside and the inside of the bag produces pressure at the bag surface and confines quarks .",
    "we consider that this confinement picture is valid for the pentaquark systems because it reflects only the nature of the qcd vacua .",
    "important roles of the one - gluon exchange ( oge ) interactions for the meson and baryon spectra were first pointed out by derujula , goergi and glashow@xcite .",
    "they showed in particular that the color - magnetic interaction is essential to explain the mass difference of the octet and decuplet baryons .",
    "they , however , noticed that the spectrum of the pseudoscalar mesons , the large mass differences among @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , is not reproduced purely by oge .",
    "this difficulty is known to be related to the @xmath19 anomaly , which was pointed out by weinberg@xcite .",
    "the instanton induced interaction ( iii ) may solve the @xmath19 problem , as was shown by t hooft@xcite .",
    "the instanton is a solution of the yang mills equation in the euclidean 4-dimensional space@xcite .",
    "its coupling to light quarks has special properties that it occurs through zero modes of the quark localized around the instanton and that it changes chirality and thus breaks @xmath19 symmetry . in the meson spectrum",
    ", iii gives significant mass splitting between @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "interesting roles of iii in the baryon spectrum were studied by shuryak - rosner@xcite and oka - takeuchi@xcite in 1989 .",
    "they pointed out that the spin - spin interaction comes also from iii and iii ( with or without oge ) gives a similar spectrum of baryons .",
    "therefore the baryon spectrum can not be used to determine which of the two interactions are responsible for the mass splitting of hadrons .",
    "it is , of course , most likely that both of them contribute to the octet - decuplet splitting . indeed ,",
    "if we assume that the splitting comes only from the color - magnetic interaction of oge , then the coupling strength required to reproduce empirical data is in general too large in the sense that the perturbative treatment is hardly justified .",
    "it is , therefore , favorable that iii is responsible for a part of the octet - decuplet splitting and thus reduces the part given by oge .    other possibilities of inter - quark interactions include exchange of the nambu - goldstone bosons of chiral symmetry breaking@xcite .",
    "the ng boson exchange gives a flavor - spin dependent force , which contributes to the octet - decuplet mass splitting .",
    "it was also pointed out that such interaction may generate considerable diquark correlations in the pentaquark baryon@xcite .",
    "we , however , do not consider the ng boson exchange in the present study in the context of the mit bag model .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to clarify roles of iii in the pentaquark systems employing the model mentioned above .",
    "we consider iii in the context of the mit bag model .",
    "namely , we assume that iii is applied to quarks inside a bag .",
    "this assumption may need some explanation . in the naive bag model , the `` vacuum '' inside the bag",
    "is identified as the perturbative vacuum where there is no gluon condensate . as a consequence ,",
    "instanton densities inside the bag could be different from that employed in the instanton vacuum picture .",
    "it is , however , argued that such an approach is not able to reproduce appropriate spectrum of the pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "therefore we consider a situation that the vacuum structure is minimally modified , while quantum excitation modes exist only in the bag . on the other hand ,",
    "it is natural to assume that the confinement mechanism that successfully describes three - quark baryon states is common to the pentaquark baryons .",
    "also there is an advantage of the bag model , i.e. , the quarks inside the baryon are treated relativistically .",
    "we concentrate on the masses of the exotic baryons , and first point out that the mass of @xmath0 predicted by quark models that reproduce the masses of ordinary ( 3-quark ) baryons is considerably larger that the experimental value , 1540 mev .",
    "this is demonstrated for the @xmath20 state in the bag model@xcite .",
    "next , we advocate importance of iii in the pentaquark systems@xcite . we stress that iii becomes significant for flavor singlet states of quarks and exotic states with many quarks .",
    "some previous works consider iii in the context of diquark models of the pentaquark baryons@xcite .",
    "iii is well known to give strong correlation between @xmath13 quarks forming a scalar diquark with isospin @xmath21 and spin @xmath22 .",
    "it was also suggested that iii is a main driving force of color superconductivity phase that may appear in qcd at a finite baryon density .",
    "recent calculation shown important contribution from two - body correlation , although they include only the oge interaction@xcite .",
    "we , however , do not take into account two - body correlations in this work , but only single particle motions of the `` shell model '' type are considered , although inclusion of such correlation is the next step .    in sect .",
    "2 , we give formulations of the instanton induced interactions and the mit bag model . in sect .",
    "3 , the results for the masses and sizes of the pentaquarks and @xmath3 dibaryon are presented . in sect .",
    "4 , the conclusion is given .",
    "the instanton induced interaction ( iii ) , introduced by t hooft@xcite , is an interaction among quarks of @xmath23 light flavors , which is induced by coupling of quarks to instantons ( and anti - instantons ) through zero modes .",
    "the instanton is a classical solution of the gauge field equation for the euclidean 4-dimensional space , which is one of the most important non - perturbative effects in qcd .",
    "the main difference from the perturbative gluon - exchange interactions is that iii is not chirally invariant and applies only on flavor singlet states of quarks .",
    "t hooft pointed out that iii solves the @xmath19 problem , namely the origin of @xmath24 mass splitting .",
    "we employ a long wave length approximation so that the size of the instanton ( @xmath25 fm ) is neglected .",
    "then the interaction is written as a contact interaction@xcite .",
    "@xmath26 where @xmath27 is the field operator of the quark , @xmath28 is totally asymmetric tensor , and @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 represent flavor . @xmath32 and @xmath33 are chiral indices .",
    "@xmath34 is the 3-body hamiltonian and @xmath35 is the 2-body hamiltonian obtained by contracting a quark pair in the 3-body iii into a quark condensate or the quark mass term .",
    "then the relation between the strengths of the 2-body and 3-body iii is given by @xmath36 where we neglect the current quark mass , @xmath37 is the constituent mass of the quark .",
    "we use @xmath38 .",
    "the @xmath39 is the quark condensate .",
    "we use @xmath40 .",
    "the 3-body interaction @xmath34 is repulsive , while the 2-body interaction @xmath35 is attractive because the quark condensate is negative .",
    "the 2-body iii has three flavor types , ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "@xmath42 , for instance , is an interaction between @xmath4 and @xmath5 quarks that is obtained by contracting @xmath43 quark pair from the 3-body hamiltonian . as a result",
    ", @xmath42 is proportional to the effective quark mass of strangeness , @xmath44 .",
    "thus we obtain @xmath45    we concentrate on the ground state baryons .",
    "both the 2-body iii and the 3-body iii do not affect the decuplet baryons , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , because iii is applied only to flavor anti - symmetric quarks .",
    "likewise for the octet baryon , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , the 3-body iii does not exert . on the other hand ,",
    "the 2-body iii gives attractive force .",
    "but the effects of the 2-body iii are similar to the one gluon exchange ( oge ) regarding the spin structure@xcite .",
    "thus the baryon spectrum can be reproduced by any combination oge and the 2-body iii , that is , we can not determine the strength of iii from the baryon spectrum .",
    "takeuchi and oka@xcite pointed out that the 3-body iii plays an important role in the @xmath3 dibaryon , a flavor singlet system of @xmath50 .",
    "the fact that a deeply bound @xmath3 dibaryon does not exist favors a strong 3-body iii , while is repulsive in the @xmath3 system .",
    "the pseudoscalar and scalar mesons are also known to be sensitive to iii@xcite .",
    "since @xmath51 has only one strange anti - quark , the repulsive force from the 3 body iii is expected to be weaker than that for the @xmath3 dibaryon .",
    "we introduce the instanton induced interaction in the mit bag model .",
    "this effect for the baryon and meson is shown by kochelev _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite .",
    "the mass splitting between the octet baryons and the decuplet baryons comes from the hyperfine interaction .",
    "the origin of the hyperfine interaction can be either the one gluon exchange ( oge ) or the instanton induced interaction ( iii ) .",
    "the mass of a hadron in the mit bag model@xcite is given by @xmath52 where @xmath32 is the bag radius , @xmath53 is the number of the @xmath54 quarks , and @xmath55 is the number of the @xmath6 and @xmath56 quarks .",
    "the function @xmath57 denotes the single particle energy obtained as an eigenvalue of the dirac equation for the bag .",
    "@xmath58 is the zero point energy as well as corrections due to the center of mass motion of the bag .",
    "@xmath59 is the bag constant .",
    "the fifth term is the color - magnetic part from oge .",
    "@xmath60 is the strength including the spatial contribution , which is given in appendix [ ap : oge ] .",
    "and we neglect the color - electric interaction .",
    "the @xmath34 and @xmath35 are contributions of iii which we introduce .",
    "@xmath61 is a parameter which represents the portion of the hyperfine splitting induced by iii . by multiplying @xmath61 to iii and @xmath62 to oge , we keep the mass splitting of @xmath63 to 300mev .",
    "if @xmath64 , the mass splitting of @xmath63 comes purely from oge , while for @xmath65 it comes purely from iii .",
    "another way of determining @xmath61 is to reproduce the @xmath24 mass difference .",
    "although the method suffers from model dependence , we estimated @xmath66 , and in the case of the mit bag model , @xmath67@xcite . @xmath68 in eq.([bagmass ] ) is a parameter introduced to reproduce the mass of the nucleon .",
    "if we ignore the changes of the radii of @xmath69 and @xmath70 under the variation of @xmath61 , @xmath68 is given roughly by @xmath71 .",
    "the effect of @xmath68 can be taken into account by changing @xmath72 and @xmath59 accordingly , but here for simplicity we fix @xmath72 and @xmath59 and change @xmath68 as a function of @xmath61 .",
    "we obtain the masses and the radii of the pentaquarks by minimizing @xmath73 , @xmath74 the parameters of the bag model are taken from the original mit bag model , degrand _ _ et al.__@xcite , @xmath75 , @xmath72 = 1.84 , @xmath76=@xmath77 = 0.55 , @xmath44 = 0.279 gev and @xmath78 = 0 gev .",
    "it is found that the mass spectrum of the 3-quark baryons hardly change by introducing iii .",
    "we consider a negative parity pentaquark . in the mit bag model ,",
    "such a state is given by placing all the quarks in the ground @xmath79 state , which is obtained by solving the free dirac equation with linear boundary condition @xmath80 at @xmath81 .",
    "the single particle energy of this ground state is obtained by solving @xmath82 for the massless quark , @xmath83=2.04 .",
    "the wave function of the lowest energy @xmath79 state is given by @xmath84 where @xmath85 where @xmath69 denotes the normalization constant , @xmath32 is the bag radius , @xmath86 is the spherical bessel function , and @xmath87 denotes a two component pauli spinor . for the antiparticle , we get the negative frequency mode operated by charge conjugation , @xmath88 we show the matrix elements of oge and iii in appendix .",
    "we consider the pentaquarks @xmath51 composed of @xmath89 with isospin 0 , spin 1/2 and negative parity , and @xmath2 , a partner within the flavor @xmath90 with isospin 3/2 .",
    "we also consider @xmath91 , which is the spin partner of @xmath51 .",
    "note that the only possible spin partner for the negative parity case is the spin 3/2 state , and no spin 5/2 state is allowed due to permutation symmetry .",

    "the right end , @xmath65 , gives the masses when the @xmath63 splitting is purely due to iii .",
    "first , we point out that the pure oge lowers the masses of @xmath51 from the noninteracting 5 quark state .",
    "one sees that the @xmath51 is affected by iii most strongly among these states . at @xmath61=1 ,",
    "the mass of @xmath51 is 100mev smaller than that at @xmath64 .",
    "it is , however , not sensitive to @xmath61 in the region , @xmath93 , which is considered to be realistic .",
    "in contrast , @xmath91 changes significantly in this region . for all @xmath61 ,",
    "the mass of @xmath2 is almost constant .",
    "the mass of the @xmath3 dibaryon grows monotonically as @xmath61 increases .",
    "it is found that the mass of @xmath51 does not agree with the experimental value ( 1540mev ) even if the full iii is introduced . on the other hand ,",
    "the model reproduces the mass of @xmath2 at @xmath93 . in order to improve this situation",
    "we may further take into account an attractive interaction or correlation .",

    "[ split ] shows the mass splitting between @xmath51 and the other pentaquarks .",
    "the mass splitting between @xmath2 and @xmath51 increases as @xmath61 because the single particle energy in the bag behaves as @xmath94 . on the other hand ,",
    "the mass splitting between @xmath91 and @xmath51 comes from the spin - spin interaction between the four quarks state with spin 1 and the @xmath56 quark , and its dependence on @xmath61 is weak .",
    "the mass splittings of @xmath95 and @xmath96.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    finally , we show the contribution of each term of iii .",
    "iii in eqs.([h3 ] ) and ( [ h2 ] ) have two types of interactions , which are the term proportional to identity and the term dependent on the spin .",
    "we show the numbers for the @xmath51 with its bag radius same as the nucleon , r=5 @xmath97=0.985fm . @xmath98",
    "the total contribution , which is @xmath35 and @xmath34 , is @xmath99 the numbers suffixed by 1 ( @xmath100 ) denote the contributions from the identity ( spin ) term of iii .",
    "we find that the main contribution of iii in the pentaquark comes from the identity term , which gives @xmath101 of the total value .",
    "the corresponding value for the nucleon is @xmath102 .",
    "the contribution of the identity term is so large because its effect is essentially proportional to the number of quark pairs in the pentaquark , namely 10 , while it is only 3 for the ordinary baryon .",
    "effects of the instanton induced interaction on the spectrum of @xmath0 , @xmath91 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 dibaryon have been studied using the mit bag model of hadron structure in the negative parity case .",
    "the bag provides a permanent confinement and the mass splittings are attributed to spin - dependent interactions induced by the one - gluon exchange as well as the instanton - quark couplings .",
    "we have found that iii lowers the mass of @xmath0 and @xmath91 , while the mass of @xmath3 increases as the strength of iii increases .",
    "the @xmath2 mass is insensitive to the strength of iii .",
    "we have also found that the strongly attractive force of iii makes the bag radii shrink .",
    "in fact , the radii of the pentaquarks happen to be as small as the radius of the 3-quark baryons .",
    "the attraction comes mainly from the spin - independent part of iii , which is proportional to the number of quark ( anti - quark ) pairs in the system .",
    "thus the attraction in the pentaquark systems is ( 10/3 ) times as large as that in the three - quark baryons .",
    "the attraction is stronger for the @xmath3 dibaryon because the number of pairs is 15 in the six - quark system .",
    "it is , however , the 3-body iii that strongly repulsive for @xmath3 .",
    "the repulsion is weaker in @xmath0 ( and in @xmath91 ) than in @xmath3 , because the number of @xmath4-@xmath5-@xmath6 combinations inside the pentaquark is just a half of that in @xmath3 .",
    "the 2-body iii is weaker in the @xmath2 system because the @xmath35 is proportional to the inverse of the effective quark masses and it is therefore weaker for the strange quark .",
    "we have also found that the spin - spin splitting between the @xmath51 and @xmath91 is larger than the splitting of @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "this is one of the distinctive feature of the negative parity pentaquarks in comparison to the positive parity states , where the spin - orbit force is responsible for the @xmath103 splitting and it is generally weaker than the spin - spin force .",
    "moreover , the contribution of oge for the @xmath91 is very small .",
    "therefore the splitting of @xmath51 and @xmath91 , if it is found , should give us important information on the structure of the pentaquarks .",
    "in all , we have shown that the instanton induced interaction is an important ingredient of the pentaquark spectrum and should be taken into account in evaluating their masses .",
    "the present results are not completely satisfactory in detail , however . for instance",
    ", it can not reproduce the observed @xmath0 mass .",
    "it also underestimates the mass of @xmath3 , which has not been found below the @xmath104 threshold , 2231 mev .",
    "possible resolutions are corrections from expected two - body ( diquark type ) correlations , pionic effects , which may be included in chiral bag models , and also couplings to background @xmath105 scattering states . if ( one or some of ) these effects are important , the pentaquark spectrum may be well modified .",
    "the instanton induced interaction will contribute to the two - body correlation significantly , as has been already suggested in relation to the color superconductivity of the qcd vacuum at finite baryon density .",
    "it seems also important to include the effect of the @xmath105 continuum , which should make the width of the negative parity pentaquark state large .    despite these defects ,",
    "the current study is worthwhile because using the simplest possible picture of the hadron , we demonstrate how large and important are the effects of instantons on the spectrum of pentaquarks and the @xmath3 dibaryon .",
    "further analysis including the above - mentioned corrections are to be performed as the next step .",

    "<S> roles of instanton induced interactions ( iii ) in the masses of pentaquark baryons , @xmath0 ( @xmath1 and 3/2 ) and @xmath2 , and a dibaryon , @xmath3 , are discussed using the mit bag model in the negative parity case . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the two - body terms in iii give a strong attraction mainly due to the increase of the number of pairs in multi - quark systems . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the three - body @xmath4-@xmath5-@xmath6 interaction is repulsive . it is found that iii lowers the mass of @xmath0 as much as 100 mev from the mass predicted by the bag model without iii . </S>"
