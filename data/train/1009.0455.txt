    "there were some contributions on the exploration of classical consistency of a pure yang - mills ( ym ) type formulation for gravity , including the cosmological extension@xcite ( and the references therein ) , among others . in those references ,",
    "einstein s theory is recovered after the imposition of torsion constraints .",
    "unfortunately , the path to a quantum version ( if it is finally possible ) is not straightforward .",
    "for example , it is well known that the lagrangian of a pure ym theory based on the lorentz group @xmath1@xcite leads to a non - positive hamiltonian ( due to non - compactness of the aforementioned gauge group ) and , then the canonical quantization procedure fails .",
    "however , there is a possible way out if it is considered an extension of the ym model thinking about a theory like gauss - bonnet with torsion@xcite and this is confirmed because the existence of a possible family of quadratical curvature theories from which can be recovered unitarity@xcite .",
    "a first aim of this work is to expose , with some detail , a similar ( and obvious ) situation about non - unitarity in a ym formulation for gravity in both massless and massive theories .",
    "there is an interest focussed in the study of massive gravity and propagating torsion@xcite , among others .",
    "particularly , the massive versions that we will explore here arise , on one hand from some quadratical terms set ( @xmath2-terms ) preserving parity which depends on torsion ( the old idea about considering @xmath2-terms in a dynamical theory of torsion has been considered in the past@xcite ) and , at a perturbative regime they give rise to a fierz - pauli s massive term ( in analogy with the recently bht model@xcite ) . on the other hand , we remark some aspects of the topologically masive version of the ym gravity@xcite which do not preserves parity and how is the way to reach unitarity in a perturbative level , at least .    whatever the model considered ( massive or non massive ) , throughout this work we follow the spirit of kibble s idea@xcite treating the metric as a fixed background , meanwhile the torsion ( contortion ) will be considered as a dynamical field and it would be thought as a quantum fluctuation around a classical fixed background .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next section is devoted to a brief review on notation of the cosmologically extended ym formulation@xcite in @xmath3-dimensions and its topologically massive version in @xmath0 dimension@xcite . in section 3",
    ", we consider the scheme of linearization of the massless theory around a fixed minkowskian background , allowing fluctuations on torsion .",
    "next , the lagrangian analysis of constraints and construction of the reduced action is performed , showing that this theory does propagate degrees of freedom , including a ghost .",
    "we end this section with some remarks about the counting of degrees of freedom in a non perturbative level . in section 4",
    ", we introduce an appropiate @xmath2-terms , which preserve parity , general covariance , and its linearization gives rise to a fierz - pauli mass term .",
    "there , the non - positive definite hamiltonian problem gets worse : the lagrangian analysis shows that the theory has more non - unitary degrees of freedom and we ca nt expect other thing .",
    "gauge transformations are explored in section 5 .",
    "although @xmath2-terms provide mass only to some spin component of contortion , the linearized theory loses the gauge invariance and there is no residual invariance .",
    "this is clearly established through a standard procedure for the study of possible chains of gauge generators@xcite . in section 6",
    "we confirm the well known fact that there exists a family of theories which can cure the ghost problem@xcite , at least at perturbative level .",
    "those theories are classically consistent when it is shown that the set of solutions contains the einsteinian s ones .",
    "we end up with some concluding remarks .",
    "let @xmath4 be an @xmath3-dimensional manifold with a metric , @xmath5 and coordinates transformations , @xmath6 provided .",
    "a ( principal ) fiber bundle is constructed with @xmath4 and a 1-form connection is given , @xmath7 which will be non metric dependent .",

    "the gauge invariant action with cosmological contribution is@xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 is in length units , @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the cosmologic constant and the parameter @xmath18 depends on dimension .",
    "the shape of @xmath19 allows the recovering of ( free ) einstein s equations as a particular solution when the torsionless lagrangian constraints are imposed and @xmath19 changes it sign when @xmath20 .",

    "it is well known that the introduction of a chern - simons lagrangian term ( cs ) in the hilbert - einstein formulation of gravity provides a theory which describes a massive excitation of a graviton in 2 + 1 dimensions@xcite . if a cosmological term is included , the cosmologically extended topological massive gravity ( tmg@xmath17 ) arises@xcite .",
    "so , the study of consistence of a yang - mills type formulation for topological massive gravity with cosmological constant has been performed@xcite . there , it is verifying the existence of causal propagation and the fact that the standard tmg@xmath17 can be recovered from the aforementioned model at the torsionless limit .",
    "the model is @xmath27 which does not preserve parity and @xmath28 is given by ( [ eqa1 ] ) for @xmath29 .",

    ", the tmg@xmath17 model is recovered from this ym one if we take the mass value @xmath38 as the mass of the chern - simons model and the consistency condition ( [ eqam10 ] ) is fixed as ( [ eqam13 ] ) .",
    "with a view on the performing of a perturbative study of the massive model , we wish to note some aspects of the variational analysis of free action ( [ eqa1 ] ) in @xmath0 dimensions .",
    "as we had said above , the connection will be considered as a dynamical field whereas the space - time metric would be a fixed background , in order to explore ( in some sense ) the isolated behavior of torsion ( contortion ) and avoid higher order terms in the field equations . for simplicity",
    "we assume @xmath39 .",

    "thinking in variations @xmath49 for this case @xmath50 .",

    "s counting of this model at a non perturbative regime can be remarked . if one keep in mind a physical system where the metric is considered as a non dynamical field ( otherwise we get a new problem with additional degrees of freedom coming from fluctuations of the metric ) , the essencial problem to face up here is related to the lagrangian ( or hamiltonian ) analysis of a second order action with potentials which depend on the fourth - order power of the contortion field . in detail , the riemann - cartan curvature , @xmath84 can be decomposed in terms of the riemann - christofell , @xmath85 and contortion , this means @xmath86+[k_\\mu , \\gamma_\\nu]\\,\\ , , \\label{e40}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the components of the matrix @xmath87 and @xmath88 are the christofell s symbols and contortion components , respectively .",

    "the object @xmath277 is a third order polynomial in fields and first order in derivatives of these ones and even though its shape is awful , however it identically vanishes when christofell s symbols are null .",
    "the expression ( [ eqc3b ] ) clearly explains the demanded behavior of the perturbative regime in a background with a flat metric provided .",
    "there are two possible massive cases . on one hand , the topological massive model ( [ eqa2 ] )",
    "can be considered , which is sensitive under parity . on the other hand , there is a  fierz - pauli  model ( [ eqa3 ] ) , whose mass vanishes when one take a null torsion .",
    "our main pourpose in this section is to study the classical consistence of field equations ( we asume that the torsionless limit must be consistent with einstein s theory ) , and then focusing the attention at the massless and topological massive cases .    in the massless theory with cosmological constant , @xmath17 in @xmath0 dimension",
    ", we introduce a cosmological term as follows @xmath278 where @xmath279 is a ( unknown ) real function of family s parameters .",
    "next , in order to consider classical consistence at the torsionless regime , we take into account some auxiliary fields ( lagrange multipliers ) , @xmath280 and the action with torsion constraints is given by @xmath281 where arbitrary variations on fields @xmath280 , obviously provide the condition @xmath282 . then , the field equation coming from variations of connection is @xmath283 where @xmath284 is defined in terms of the yang - mills curvature , @xmath285 in the way @xmath286   \\nonumber \\\\+2(1+\\alpha ) [ ( { f^\\mu}_\\rho ) ^{\\nu\\sigma}-({f^\\nu}_\\rho ) ^{\\mu\\sigma } ] + 2 \\alpha [ ( { f^\\nu}_\\lambda ) ^{\\lambda\\sigma } { \\delta^\\mu}_\\rho-({f^\\mu}_\\lambda ) ^{\\lambda\\sigma } { \\delta^\\nu}_\\rho ] \\nonumber \\\\+(1 + 2\\alpha + 8\\beta)[({f^\\sigma}_\\lambda ) ^{\\lambda\\mu } { \\delta^\\nu}_\\rho-({f^\\sigma}_\\lambda ) ^{\\lambda\\nu } { \\delta^\\mu}_\\rho ] \\nonumber \\\\+2\\beta(f_{\\lambda\\kappa})^{\\lambda\\kappa}(g^{\\mu\\sigma}{\\delta^\\nu}_\\rho -g^{\\nu\\sigma}{\\delta^\\mu}_\\rho ) \\,\\",

    "so , the object defined in ( [ eqc5b ] ) takes the shape @xmath295 which do not depend on parameter @xmath260 .",
    "moreover , if @xmath261 is fixed as @xmath296 then , relation ( [ eqc7 ] ) leads to @xmath297 and this one satisfies all symmetry properties of a curvature , showing in relations ( [ eqc6a])-([eqc6c ] ) with the exception of the bianchi identities , ( [ eqc6d ] ) .",
    "it can be noted that the trace of ( [ eqc7b ] ) , this means @xmath298 is the einstein s tensor .",
    "next , some discussion on the critical value ( [ eqc7a ] ) will be performed when the connection s field equation is taking into account . with the help of symmetry properties , bianchi s identities , and relationship between riemann - christoffel and ricci tensor , the field equation ( [ eqc5a ] ) can be rewritten as follows @xmath299 and with some algebraic computation on this last equation , it can be shown ( for all @xmath261 ) the next symmetry property @xmath300 and @xmath301 @xmath302 consistence condition ( [ eqc8b ] ) stablishes that the work out of lagrange multipliers depends on the following restriction @xmath303 then , @xmath304 .",
    "this last result means that one can consistently replace @xmath304 inside the action ( [ eqc5 ] ) and , then the torsionless limit can be recovered through the condition @xmath305 imposed on the new field equations .",
    "condition ( [ eqc9 ] ) induces a wide set of possible vacuum s solutions , including non - einstenian ones beside ( a)ds , because eq . ( [ eqc8c ] ) becomes an identity when it is evaluated on the critical @xmath261 given by ( [ eqc7a ] ) .",
    "this fact is confirmed when @xmath306 is introduced in eq .",
    "( [ eqc8 ] ) , in other words @xmath307 where notation means @xmath308 it can be observed that equation ( [ eqc9a ] ) looks like eq .",
    "( [ g1a ] ) , but here , as one can expect the trace @xmath25 of ( [ eqc9a ] ) is an identity .    in order to conclude the comments on the massless theory ,",
    "next we consider the field equation which comes from variations on metric of the action ( [ eqc5 ] ) and it can be written in terms of ricci s tensor and ricci s scalar as follows @xmath309 immediately , the consistence with ( a)ds solutions is evaluated by replacing the contractions of @xmath310 in ( [ eqc10 ] ) .",
    "this gives @xmath311 and this indicates that if @xmath312 is introduced in action ( [ eqc5 ] ) get implicit ( a)ds solutions from its field equations .",
    "now we take a look on the gauge formulation of topological masive gravity with cosmological constant , considering the ym - extended action at the torsionless limit , this means @xmath313 where @xmath314 is defined by ( [ eqc10a ] ) then , this action is consistent with ( a)ds solutions when @xmath315 .",
    "variations on the metric conduce to the known equations ( [ eqc10 ] ) .",
    "so , the connection field equation is @xmath316 and @xmath317 is defined in ( [ eqc5b ] ) . recalling that @xmath287 in a torsionless space - time , equation ( [ eqc12 ] ) can be rewritten in terms of ricci s tensor as follows @xmath318 performing some algebraic manipulation on this last equation , conditions ( [ eqc8a ] ) and ( [ eqc8c ] ) , which establish the symmetry property of lagrange multipliers and the indetermination of scalar curvature when @xmath306 , rise again in a similar way that they do in the massless theory .",
    "then , using condition ( [ eqc9 ] ) , the lagrange multipliers are given by @xmath319 and if ( [ eqc7a ] ) is fixed , the result ( [ eqa14a ] ) is recovered .",
    "so , evaluating the theory on @xmath306 , the action ( [ eqc13 ] ) becomes in a similar form as in ( [ eq13 ] ) , this means @xmath320 where @xmath321 is defined as in ( [ eqc9b ] ) and the trace @xmath25 is an identity , as one can expect .",
    "a perturbative regime based on arbitrary variations of the contortion and metric as a ( classical ) fixed background , is performed in the context of a pure yang - mills formulation of the @xmath322 gauge group .",
    "there , we analyze in detail the physical content and the well known fact that a variational principle based on the propagation of torsion ( contortion ) , as dynamical and possible candidate for a quantum canonical description of gravity in a pure ym formulation gets serious difficulties .",
    "in the @xmath0 dimensional massless case we show that the theory contains three massless degrees of freedom , one of them a non - unitary mode , considering a non dynamical background s metric .",
    "then , introducing appropiate quadratical terms dependent on torsion , which preserve parity and general covariance , we can see that the linearized limit do not reproduces an equivalent pure hilbert - einstein - fierz - pauli massive theory for a spin-2 mode and , moreover there is other non - unitary modes",
    ". roughly speaking , at first sight one can blame it on the kinetic part of ym formulation because the existence of non - positive hamiltonian connected with non - unitarity problem .",
    "nevertheless there are other possible @xmath323 models ( or simply _ ym - extended _ ) which could solve the unitarity problem .    exploring the massless and the topological massive gravity models in @xmath0 dimension ,",
    "the well known existence of a ym - extended theories family is noted .",
    "this family is labeled with two free parameters , @xmath260 and @xmath261 and can cure non - unitary propagations in the linearized level . moreover , when the classical consistence between these type of theories and the einstein s one is tackled , what we have mentioned as _ torsionless limit _ , the relationship between parameter @xmath260 and the shape of the coupling of the cosmological constant in the action , is shown .    meanwhile , the parameter @xmath261 get two types of critical values . on one side , the number @xmath324 is connected to the classical consistence requirement which demands the introduction of torsion s lagrangian constraints with solvable lagrange multipliers . on the other side , the value @xmath306 establishes a wide set of theories , including the einstein s solutions after the imposition of a auxiliary condition @xmath26 and non - einsteinian ones when the ricci scalar became an arbitrary function in an empty space - time .",
    "but , even though the lagrangian extension of the ym formulation for gravity conduces to the well known fact that there exists unphysical classical solutions , the same occurs ( in a much less severe way ) without these corrections and one can recall the ym pure formulation gives rise a set of solutions for the massless and topological massive gravity with the property @xmath26 and only einsteinian results can be obtained if the auxiliary condition @xmath325 is fixed .",
    "a generalization of the study of physical content of the ym - extended model in a non perturbative level , including a dynamical metric would be considered elsewhere .",
