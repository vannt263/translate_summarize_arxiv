    "this is consistent with the behavior of the soft - fa model : in the analogy with atomistic glass - formers it requires that the inactive phase be a liquid , and not a crystal or glass phase where non - trivial density profiles persist indefinitely .",

    "<S> the east model has a dynamical phase transition between an active ( fluid ) and inactive ( glass ) state . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this phase transition generalizes to `` softened '' systems where constraint violations are allowed with small but finite probabilities . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we show that the first order coexistence line separating the active and inactive phases terminates in a finite - temperature space - time critical point . implications of these results for equilibrium dynamics are discussed .        </S>",
    "<S> glasses are formed when liquids are cooled below their melting temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> these supercooled liquids eventually fall out of equilibrium and form glass @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the transition between a flowing supercooled liquid and a rigid glass occurs with only a modest change in temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting glass has a microscopic structure which appears to be indistinguishable from its originating supercooled liquid , despite large , but not abrupt , changes in its macroscopic properties . </S>",
    "<S> several theories connect the glass transition to some kind of unusual equilibrium phase transition @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , studies based on the dynamical facilitation theory of the glass transition  @xcite have demonstrated connections between glassy behavior and dynamical phase transitions , which take place not in equilibrium ensembles but in space - time ensembles of trajectories  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such phase transitions are not typically accompanied by equilibrium phase transitions  @xcite , although some models do support both equilibrium and dynamical transitions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamical phase transitions are controlled by a biasing field , herein known as @xmath0 , which couples to a measure of space - time activity , @xmath1 . here </S>",
    "<S> we investigate these phase transitions in a softened version of the east model  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> glasses are often separated into two categories , labeled fragile and strong @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> strong glassformers are those whose transport properties ( such as relaxation time @xmath2 or viscosity @xmath3 ) follow an arrhenius scaling with respect to inverse temperature , @xmath4 </S>",
    "<S> . on the other hand , fragile glassformers are those that have transport properties that depend on temperature in a more dramatic `` super - arrhenius '' fashion . within the dynamical facilitation theory  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , strong glass behavior is linked with diffusive relaxation processes while fragile behavior is usually correlated with hierarchical relaxation . in practice , glasses can exhibit a range of behaviors interpolating between strong and fragile behavior . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , it has been shown  @xcite that relaxation - time data for glassformers can be collapsed onto a single parabolic curve where @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this collapse was theoretically predicted based on kinetically constrained models ( kcms ) of glassformers with hierarchical relaxation  @xcite suggesting ( at least within dynamical facilitiation theory ) that most molecular glassformers exhibit some form of hierarchical relaxation . </S>",
    "<S> the softened east model has such hierarchical relaxation , which motivates its use in this study . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we will compare the behavior of the softened east model with the softened fredrickson - andersen ( fa ) model considered in  @xcite , which has diffusive relaxation mechanism and scaling reminiscent of strong glasses . </S>",
    "<S> we will discuss similarities between the dynamical phase transitions in these two models , as well as important differences that arise due to the combination of softened kinetic constraints and hierarchical relaxation with super - arrhenius scaling . </S>"
