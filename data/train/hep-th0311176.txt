    "some proposals based on the structure of the vacuum have been recently formulated @xcite . in these scenarios",
    "the cosmological constant value and the baryonic asymmetry are associated to the tunneling between different classical vacua of a yang - mills like theory .",

    "the tunneling from this initial state to @xmath0vacuum is exponentially suppressed and might account for the tiny value of the present cosmological constant @xcite and the observed baryonic asymmetry @xcite . according to this picture the value of the cosmological constant will decrease with the time evolution of the universe .",
    "although the approach is very appealing it suffers from inconsistency .",
    "gauge invariance implies that all classical vacua are equivalent , thus , localization around one specific vacua requires the breaking of gauge invariance . on the other",
    "the existence of a finite mass gap requires that any physical state with very small energy must involve a fine - tuning of the coefficients of the series expansion of the state in stationary states .    from a different perspective",
    "a more conservative approach simply remarks the common smallness of the three parameters ( qcd parameter , the cosmological constant and the baryonic asymmetry ) and suggests that there might exist an relation between them .",
    "one appealing feature of this scenario is that three fundamental fine tuning problems are reduced to only one .",
    "although one has still to explain the reason for the existence of the common fine tuning .",

    "in fact , the mere existence of a non - trivial value of @xmath7 has dramatic consequences for both cosmological problems . in all approaches to the solution of the baryonic asymmetry problem",
    "the requirement of violation of @xmath8 symmetry appears as a fundamental prerequisite .",
    "although there are other leading sources of cp violation the possibility of having a non - trivial vacuum is a complementary signal of the existence of the asymmetry .",
    "the variation of the vacuum energy with @xmath0 also opens the possibility of a connection with the cosmological constant problem . if the cosmological constant vanishes for some value of ( e.g. @xmath1 ) by some fundamental reason or theory ( strings , supersymmetry , quantum gravity , etc ) , an infinitesimal deviation of value of might induce a very tiny vacuum energy density enough to explain the small observed value of @xmath5 .",

    "the smoothness of @xmath9 is claimed to hold at first order around @xmath17 by the vafa - witten theorem @xcite on the absence of spontaneous symmetry breaking of cp symmetry in qcd .",

    "in fact , @xmath9 is not always smooth at @xmath18 : there are cases where cp is spontaneously broken at that point . in principle , the same pathology could appear also at @xmath17 .    if we assume that @xmath9 has a smooth behavior at @xmath17 and @xmath18 a very simple argument shows that the expectation value of the topological density @xmath19 vanishes at @xmath17 and @xmath18 , i.e. @xmath20 . the argument is based on the fact that the two classically cp symmetric vacua @xmath17 and @xmath18 are extremal points of the vacuum energy density . in the case",

    "one can make sure that the vacuum expectation value of the topological density vanishes and the vafa - witten theorem holds for this particular order parameter .",
    "the smoothness of @xmath9 at @xmath17 has been first proved in ref.@xcite .",
    "let us summarize the essential arguments of the proof .",
    "the proof is based on the analysis of possible existence of lee - yang singularities .",
    "non - analyticities in the dependence can be easily traced from the lack of an analytic continuation into the complex @xmath0 plane . indeed , for complex values of os positivity ( i.e. unitarity ) is not preserved and",
    "there is no guarantee that the free energy is well defined , in which case it does not make sense to speak about smoothness . essentially , there are two possible ways in which the @xmath0 theory might give rise to pathological non - analyticities in the complex sector .",
    "one possibility is that the analytic continuation of the partition function for complex values of  is not defined at all , i.e. the partition function itself becomes divergent .",
    "the other possibility is that the partition function exhibits a sequence of zeros converging to @xmath17 in the infinite volume limit .",
    "this is the scenario advocated by lee and yang @xcite which signals in many cases the existence of a phase transition .    for complex values of the partition function",
    "can be split into a sum of functional integrals over the different topological sectors _ ( g)=_q=-^^-q+q -18mu3ex -14mu a   e^-s_eff(g , q ) in a strict sense , the functional integral is uv divergent but it can be regularized in such a way that its positivity properties are preserved @xcite .",
    "we can consider such a geometrical regularization whenever it is required .",
    "on the other hand , in the infinite volume limit @xmath37 vanishes unless the vacuum energy is renormalized to 0 .",
    "but it is just the dependence on @xmath0 of the vacuum energy what we want to analyze .",
    "therefore , we will consider throughout this note a compact space - time with large but finite volume @xmath38 .",
    "on the other hand the term of the action is bounded above by the yang - mills action @xmath39 in every @xmath40-topological sector by the bps bound @xmath41 . in the regularized theory , the coefficient of this linear bound increases with the uv regulating scale . in general , from positivity of fermionic determinants , yang - mills measure and the bps bounds we have the inequality |_(g ) | & & _",

    "q=-^ -10mu2ex -9mu a   e^-s_eff(,q)= _ 0 ( ) where @xmath42 .",
    "this shift of the gauge coupling constant can be considered as a change of the renormalization point .",
    "this shows that the partition function of the original theory with a complex term is bounded by the partition function of a similar theory with @xmath17 but with a different coupling constant .",
    "since the theory at @xmath17 is unitary and renormalizable , its partition function @xmath43 is finite and from the above inequality it follows that @xmath44 is also finite for small values of @xmath45 .",
    "if in addition the theory is asymptotically free , then the renormalization of @xmath46 in the uv fixed point can absorb any value of @xmath45 , which implies an infinite radius of convergence of the sum over topological sectors in the complex @xmath0 plane . to make the argument more precise",
    "one should consider the regularized theory .",
    "the bare coupling constant @xmath47 has to be fine tuned according to the renormalization group to yield the appropriate continuum limit .",
    "but because of asymptotic freedom this coupling goes to zero as the uv regulator is removed and the shift from @xmath47 to @xmath48 induced by @xmath49 simply implies a change in the effective scale of the continuum theory .",
    "the only remaining possible source of non - analyticity is the presence of lee - yang singularities , i.e. zeros in the partition function @xmath29 which could prevent the existence of a unique limit of the free energy @xmath50 or its derivatives at @xmath17 .",
    "uniform convergence of the sum over topological sectors implies continuity of @xmath29 on the complex .",
    "now , since @xmath51 for finite space - time volumes and real values of @xmath0 , from @xmath52-periodicity of @xmath29 and compactness of @xmath53 $ ] follows the existence of an open strip covering the real axis where @xmath54 .",
    "this implies that for finite volumes there is no phase transition for any real value of .",

    "can be rewritten as @xmath83 in terms of two analytic functions @xmath84 and @xmath85 .    if there were a first order phase transition at @xmath17 with spontaneous parity symmetry breaking the expectation value of the cp breaking order parameter & - & f _",

    "this fact implies that if the system undergoes a first order phase transition with parity symmetry breaking an increasing number of lee - yang zeros must arise in the partition function @xmath93 for imaginary values of @xmath0 and large enough volumes .",
    "the localization of zeros in the unit circle @xmath94 of the complex plane @xmath95 is reminiscent of the lee - yang theorem for spin systems @xcite .",
    "however this can not occur in vector - like gauge theories where we have shown that for any finite volume the partition function @xmath96 has no zeros on the imaginary line @xmath58 .",
    "therefore , the system can not undergo a first order phase transition at @xmath17 with parity symmetry breaking .",
    "in other terms , there is not a first order cusp in the vacuum energy density @xmath9 at @xmath17 , i.e. @xmath36 and the vafa - witten theorem holds .",
    "the existence of any odd - order phase transition can be discarded for the same reason because the function @xmath97 , which is odd in @xmath61 , would be unbounded and @xmath96 would have lee - yang zeros for some values of @xmath98 . however , even - order phase transitions can not be excluded by these arguments because such transitions will not require spontaneous parity symmetry breaking .",
    "recent numerical estimates provide some evidence on the absence of second order transitions for a large family of gauge groups @xcite .    in summary",
    ", there is now a complete proof of the first order smoothness of the vacuum energy density at @xmath17 : the missing link in the vafa - witten argument about the vanishing of the topological charge order parameter .",
    "from the above arguments we can not , however , exclude the existence of first order phase transitions for other values of @xmath99 . in particular",
    ", we can not discard the existence of cp symmetry breaking for @xmath18 .",
    "some authors claim the existence of a sharp first order transition at @xmath2 associated to spontaneous symmetry breaking of cp @xcite induced by massive quarks . in that case , the analytic continuation of the partition function @xmath29 to complex values of becomes an oscillating series and there might exist values of @xmath61 as close as possible to @xmath92 where the partition function @xmath100 vanishes .",
    "however , in pure yang - mills theory or theories with different quark masses some arguments support a cp symmetry preserving scenario for the @xmath2 vacuum .",
    "they are based on the existence of a strong level repulsion between parity even and parity odd lowest energy states @xcite the existence of such a mechanism can be derived form the analysis of the nodal structure of the vacuum functional of @xmath18 theory .",
    "the study of nodal structure of vacuum functionals in quantum gauge theories was initiated by feynman @xcite .",
    "he argued that confinement in @xmath101 dimensional yang - mills theories is a consequence of the absence of nodes and some extra properties of the vacuum .",
    "standard minimum principle arguments disfavor the appearance of nodes in vacuum states of quantum theories @xcite . however , the presence of cp violating interactions invalidates the use of such arguments and the vacuum response to this kind of interactions can involve the appearance of nodes . in some cases , the infrared behavior of the theory is so dramatically modified by the cp violating interaction that a confining vacuum state can become non - confining .",
    "the connection between the absence of confinement and the existence of nodes in the vacuum state , suggests that new classical field configurations related to the nodal structure of the quantum vacuum emerge as new candidates to play a significant role in the mechanism of confinement .",
    "this idea has been successfully exploited to show the absence of spontaneous breaking of cp symmetry at @xmath18 for various field theories @xcite @xcite .    in the canonical formalism and schrdinger representation",

    "this is a consequence of gauss law .",
    "there is no topological reason to force physical states to present nodal configurations , i.e. gauge orbits where the corresponding wave functionals vanish .",
    "however , there is a very simple dynamical argument showing that for any stationary state , including the vacuum , there exists a physical state with nodal configurations .",
    "the non - trivial effect of the @xmath0term is due to the non - simply connected character of the orbit space @xmath104 or what is equivalent the non - connected character of the group of gauge transformations @xmath105 .",

    "the @xmath0 dependence is encoded in the non - trivial boundary conditions that the new wave functionals @xmath109 satisfy at the boundary of @xmath110 : [ bc ] for any pair of gauge fields @xmath111 and @xmath112 in the same orbit of @xmath113 which are gauge equivalent @xmath114 by means of a gauge transformation with winding number @xmath115 . in this sense the transformation ( [ simil ] ) is trading the @xmath0dependence of the hamiltonian by non - trivial boundary conditions on @xmath113 .",
    "there are physically interesting configurations in this boundary domain , e.g. sphalerons .",
    "sphalerons are static solutions of yang - mills equations which by derrick theorem can only exist for finite space volumes .",
    "they are unstable and become characterized by the existence of a finite number of unstable decaying modes .",
    "the value of the yang - mills functional on them marks the height of the potential barrier between classical vacua and , therefore , it is related to the transition temperature necessary for the appearance of direct coalescence between those vacua .",
    "their existence was predicted by manton @xcite by an argument based on the non - simply connected nature of the orbit space of 3-dimensional gauge fields and a generalization of the ljusternik - snierelman theory .",
    "an explicit expression for the sphaleron on @xmath116 can be obtained from the observation that the pullback of one instanton to a 3-dimensional sphere embedded on @xmath117 with origin on the center of the instanton and the same radius that the instanton is an unstable critical point of the 3-dimensional yang - mills functional . for @xmath118 the sphaleron in stereographic",

    "due to the special boundary condition it is easy to see",
    "that cp parity even states must vanish on the orbits of sphaleron configurations @xmath129 $ ] whereas that cp parity odd states vanish on the orbits of classical vacuum configurations @xmath130 $ ] . if the @xmath22vacuum state were degenerate there will exist two different vacuum states @xmath131 and @xmath132 with even and odd parities , respectively .",
    "but , since the potential term @xmath133 of the hamiltonian vanishes for the vacuum configuration whereas it gets a non - null positive value for the sphaleron gauge field , the lowest energy eigenstates @xmath134 and @xmath135 can not have the same energy . in this way the the potential term induces a level repulsion which increases with space volume .",
    "the splitting of those levels means that for @xmath18 there is not spontaneous breaking of parity , the vacuum is even and vanishes for sphaleron gauge fields .",
    "since the theory is expected to deconfine for @xmath18 , the result suggest that those nodes might be responsible for the confining properties of the vacuum in absence of @xmath0 term where the vacuum has no classical nodal configurations .    as in the case @xmath17",
    "@xcite the above result shows that cp symmetry is not spontaneously broken also for @xmath18 in absence of quarks although the physical reasons are fairly different .",
    "the above results can also be extended to other theories with similar properties .",
    "one particularly interesting case is the  non - linear sigma model .",
