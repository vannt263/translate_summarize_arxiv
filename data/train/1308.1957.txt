    "as the strongest spectral feature of the most abundant element in the universe , the ly@xmath0  transition of hydrogen ( @xmath7 ; 1216  ) has become one of the most widely utilized tools for detecting galaxies in the early universe ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "ly@xmath0  is versatile in that it can probe the extremes of the high - redshift galaxy census , such as faint , low - mass populations ( e.g. , @xcite ) and the high energy systems at the top - end of the mass function ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "ly@xmath0  photons are produced as a result of excitation or ionization of neutral hydrogen and can arise in a variety of astrophysical scenarios relating to high - redshift galaxies .",
    "these include cooling radiation as a result of gravitational collapse ( e.g. , @xcite ) or extremely rapid gas motions ( i.e. , shocks ; @xcite ) , photo - ionization by stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) or an active galactic nucleus ( agn ; e.g. , @xcite ) , or fluorescence of neutral gas in the intergalactic medium ( igm ; e.g. , @xcite ) . however , the interpretation of the emergent ly@xmath0  spectra is non - trivial due to the resonant nature of the transition in neutral hydrogen , in which the line is optically thick for even small neutral fractions @xcite .",
    "this property makes the escape of ly@xmath0  photons from a galaxy a complex radiative process that is highly dependent on the properties of the interstellar medium ( ism ) and surrounding circumgalactic medium , such as gas kinematics , covering fraction , geometry , and dust content .",
    "the result of ly@xmath0  radiative transfer through the ism is a significant modulation of the intrinsic ly@xmath0  emission line profile , both spatially and spectrally .",
    "the emergent emission line profile can be further modified by transfer through the surrounding igm , which can absorb a significant amount of radiation in the vicinity and blueward of ly@xmath0  ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "because of the amount of physics that can be encoded within the emergent ly@xmath0  line profile , a great deal of theoretical work has gone into understanding ly@xmath0  radiative transfer to aid in the interpretation of observed ly@xmath0  spectra of galaxies . in particular , the use of monte carlo numerical techniques has become standard practice ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and has provided useful predictions of the emergent ly@xmath0  line profile for comparison with observations for a variety of different physical scenarios .",
    "the implementation of such radiative transfer codes are currently being advanced by post - processing more realistic models of galaxies drawn from hydrodynamic and cosmological simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "non - active galaxies that are selected by virtue of their ly@xmath0  emission with equivalent width  @xmath8   ( i.e. , ly@xmath0  emitters ; laes ) are typically low - mass ( @xmath9 ) with young stellar populations ( @xmath10 myr ) and are forming stars at rates of @xmath11  yr@xmath4 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , some laes appear to have non - negligible dust content @xcite , low gas - phase metallicity @xcite , and compact , irregular spatial morphologies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "at least some of these properties appear to not evolve significantly with redshift ( e.g. , @xcite ) . a significant fraction of ultraviolet ( uv ) continuum - selected galaxies ( i.e. , lyman break galaxies ; lbgs ) also show ly@xmath0  in emission ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "lbgs typically have lower  ( some show ly@xmath0  in absorption ) , more evolved stellar populations , and are more massive than the typical ly@xmath0-selected galaxy ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in a star - forming galaxy , ly@xmath0",
    "photons are produced from recombinations in hydrogen gas that was ionized by the uv radiation of massive , main sequence stars in  regions . unlike uv continuum or photons from other optically thin transitions that hail from the same  region ( e.g. , h@xmath0 ) , ly@xmath0  photons become resonantly trapped in the first parcels of neutral hydrogen they encounter . as compared to the optically thin photons , the path length of ly@xmath0  to escape the galaxy",
    "is increased due to the scattering , making it especially sensitive to dust absorption .",
    "the path length of ly@xmath0  photons through neutral hydrogen can be further altered by local velocity fields due to thermal motion , turbulence , and bulk motions ( e.g. , due to supernovae or stellar driven winds , or by galaxy - galaxy interactions ) , thereby shifting ly@xmath0  photons in and out of resonance and affecting the emergent line profile ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this potentially makes the emergent ly@xmath0  spectrum a very powerful probe of gas kinematics ( e.g. , @xcite ) , especially when the spectrum can be spatially resolved ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "evidence for large - scale outflows is wide - spread in high - redshift star forming galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in lbgs , for example , the galaxy s redshift differs when measured from the interstellar ( is ) absorption lines versus the ly@xmath0  emission line ( by @xmath12 km s@xmath4 ) , which implies that one or both features are not at rest with respect to the stars in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "systemic redshifts and gravitationally induced motion are expected to be well represented by nebular emission lines such as h@xmath0 , which is optically thin and whose strength depends upon the uv radiation field in the same vicinity as the origin of the ly@xmath0  photons @xcite . in lbgs ,",
    "the is absorption lines are blueshifted with respect to the h@xmath0-based systemic redshift ( by @xmath13 km s@xmath4 ) while the peak of the ly@xmath0  emission line is typically redshifted ( by @xmath14 km s@xmath4 ; @xcite ) .",
    "although the interpretation of the redshifted ly@xmath0  emission is non - trivial due to the transition s resonant scattering nature , the blueshifted is absorption is a strong indicator of a galactic outflow and is caused by the absorption of stellar light in swept - up material that is approaching along the observer s line of sight .",

    "these data provide not only standard rest - frame optical emission line diagnostics for these high - redshift galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; song et al .",
    "2013 , in preparation ) , but also a measure of their systemic redshifts @xcite .",
    "thus , ly@xmath0  velocity offsets are now be measured for laes much in the same way as for lbgs ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which provides an additional constraint when comparing ly@xmath0  radiative transfer models to the observed ly@xmath0  spectra of laes .",
    "however , velocity offsets of ly@xmath0  alone can not necessarily constrain the gas kinematics and may not correlate directly with bulk gas velocities .",
    "useful kinematic information can be encoded within the offset ly@xmath0  line profile in the form of asymmetries and other finer - scale spectral features , such as multiple emission peaks .",
    "this information can potentially be lost when observed at low spectral resolution , as has been used in multiple studies that probe ly@xmath0  velocity offsets ( e.g. , @xcite ; song et al . 2013 , in preparation ) .",
    "multiple peaks are a natural consequence of ly@xmath0  resonant line transfer ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and the frequency of multiple - peaked ly@xmath0  spectra in lae and lbg samples has recently been studied by @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "both studies find that multiple - peaked ly@xmath0  line profiles comprise @xmath6750% of their respective samples , which should be regarded as lower limits due to the limited @xmath68 and spectral resolution of the ly@xmath0  data .",
    "combined with the recent observational evidence that shows that laes have smaller ly@xmath0  velocity offsets as compared to lbgs @xcite , the spectral substructure that studies such as @xcite and @xcite have uncovered motivates observations of ly@xmath0  at higher spectral resolution . such observations will probe the ism and circumgalactic medium through which the ly@xmath0  photons traverse , and provide more stringent constraints on existing ly@xmath0  radiative transfer models . in this paper , we present new higher resolution ( 120 km s@xmath4 fwhm ) optical spectra of the ly@xmath0  emission of three galaxies that were initially discovered in the hetdex pilot survey ( hps ; @xcite ) .",

    "the survey design , catalog , and initial science results can be found in @xcite and @xcite .    as described in @xmath69[sec : introduction ] , observations of the rest - frame optical nebular emission lines are especially important for constraining models of ly@xmath0  radiative transfer and gas kinematics in star - forming galaxies . given the aforementioned focus of this paper , we require prior knowledge of the galaxy systemic redshift as measured from the rest - frame optical nebular emission lines . for two hps laes ( catalog i d 194 and 256 )",
    ", these data have been published in @xcite .",
    "additionally , the only existing optical spectra previous to this work for these galaxies are from the hps in which the mitchell spectrograph observed with 5.5   resolution ( @xmath76400 km s@xmath4 fwhm at 4100  ) , yielding unresolved ly@xmath0  emission lines @xcite . given the existing data available for these two galaxies , we have chosen to conduct follow - up observations with higher resolution optical spectroscopy .",
    "for convenience , some relevant properties of hps194 and hps256 are tabulated from the current hps publications in table [ table : galdata ] .",
    "the only preselection for the galaxies in this follow - up study is that they have a ly@xmath0  flux",

    "this grating yields a spectral resolution of @xmath82   ( 120 km s@xmath4 fwhm at 4100  ) over the wavelength range @xmath83 (  ) @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]      many studies have used the results of ly@xmath0  radiative transfer through expanding shells to help explain the observed velocity offsets of the ly@xmath0  emission line from @xmath19 for star - forming galaxies and further to constrain the velocity of their large - scale outflows ( e.g. , @xcite ; song et al .",
    "2013 , in preparation ) .",
    "the analysis in @xmath69[subsec : modelcompare ] of the spectrally resolved , multiple - peaked ly@xmath0  emission of the three laes we present shows that it is difficult to constrain some of the physical parameters of each galaxy s outflowing gas .",
    "this is especially true since even the best - fitting expanding shell radiative transfer models show major discrepancies when compared to the resolved ly@xmath0  spectra .",
    "given these discrepancies , it is of note that  and @xmath87 appear to be much better constrained than . for each galaxy ,",
    "the best - fitting model has @xmath88 @xmath29 and a high value of @xmath87 as a result of their strikingly similar values of @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "in addition , as can be seen in figure [ fig : exmodelspec ] , there is little change in the position of the dominant redward ly@xmath0  peak over the range @xmath91 ( km s@xmath4 ) @xmath92 for an expanding shell model with low neutral column density ( i.e. , @xmath93 @xmath29 ; see @xmath69[subsec : gridtrends ] ) . especially since this strong redward peak dominates the observed ly@xmath0  line profile at low spectral resolution and/or @xmath68",
    ", it appears that  has the least influence on @xmath23 of the three physical parameters that we model for a galaxy with low neutral gas column density .",
    "several of the aforementioned studies ( @xcite ; song et al .",
    "2013 , in preparation ) do in fact utilize a lower spectral resolution that is similar to the hps when observing ly@xmath0  such that objects with line profiles similar to those we present here are unresolved ( see figure [ fig : vspec ] ) . in cases for objects with multiple - peaked ly@xmath0  line profiles with @xmath94 less than the instrumental resolution , much of the information that is encoded in the multiple - peaked profile is lost and the only measurable quantity from the line profile becomes @xmath15 ( or @xmath23 when a measure of @xmath19 exists ) . we have also previously noted the instrumental effect of observing an intrinsically asymmetric emission line at low resolution in which the peak flux can can be biased in the direction of the extended emission tail ( see @xmath69[subsubsec : lyaquantitative ] ) .",
    "as a result of the loss of information , the measured @xmath23 for an unresolved line becomes a convoluted function of many parameters , including the line of sight velocity field , column density , and the temperature of the neutral gas in addition to parameters that were not explored in our models , such as dust content .",
    "even when ignoring the possible effects of the igm on the ly@xmath0  line profile ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the matter is further complicated when considering ly@xmath0  radiative transfer through more realistic models of the gas distribution and velocity fields for galaxies ( see the previous subsection ) .",
    "these models , which do not have spherically symmetric gas distributions , indicate that viewing angle should also be an important parameter in determining the degree of flux asymmetry between the multiple peaks , which can affect the value of the measured @xmath23 .    as a result of all of these factors , attempts to equate the velocity offsets from systemic that are observed in ly@xmath0  spectra to physical outflow speeds need to be treated with extreme caution .",
    "we also stress the importance of observing ly@xmath0  with high spectral resolution in order to extract the maximum amount of information from the line profile .",
    "we do point out , however , that while the _ magnitude _ of the inflow or outflow speed is not yet clearly a measurable quantity from the ly@xmath0  line profile even when spectrally resolved , the detection and sign of a non - zero @xmath23 does at least indicate presence of an outflow ( neglecting igm absorption ) or potentially inflow ( for blueshifted ly@xmath0  emission ) along the line of sight .      in figure",

    "_ , two of the galaxies ( hps194 and hps251 ) are shown to have a companion continuum source at @xmath96 distance :    _ hps194 : _ this galaxy consists of a compact source to the north - west with a possible tidal tail reaching towards the north ( this is visible as small clumps in the rest - frame uv image and is a very pronounced continuous feature in the rest - frame optical image ) .",
    "a more diffuse companion is located @xmath97 to the south - west in projection ( @xmath98 kpc if the sources are at the same redshift ) .",
    "as seen in figure [ fig : pointingthumbs ] , the nirspec slit used by @xcite is aligned along the two sources .",

    "as will be presented by blanc et al .",
    "2013 ( in preparation ) , we have also obtained deeper nir spectra of hps194 with the fire instrument @xcite at the 6.5 m magellan baade telescope . a preliminary reduction of the data yields no detection of the diffuse companion s rest - frame optical emission lines .",
    "although we can not confirm from the available data if the compact and more diffuse sources lie at the same redshift , the disturbed , asymmetric morphology and possible tidal feature emanating from the north - west compact source is suggestive of an ongoing merger .    _",
    "hps251 : _ this galaxy has a fainter , compact companion located @xmath99 ( @xmath100 kpc ) to the south - south - west in projection . like hps194 , the nirspec slit used by song et al .",
    "( 2013 , in preparation ) is aligned along the two sources .",
    "unfortunately , two of the positions of the _ abba _ dither pattern positioned the dimmer source on the bottom edge of the slit , yielding insufficient @xmath68 in the final 2-d spectrum at the position of the companion .",
    "however , recent follow - up observations using fire have confirmed detections of [ o iii ]  @xmath101 and [ o iii ]  @xmath74 for both sources at the same redshift ( these results will be presented by blanc et al .",
    "2013 , in preparation ) . at the projected distance of @xmath100 kpc ,",
    "the two components of hps251 are clearly interacting and will eventually merge .",
    "while hps256 does not have a companion within @xmath102 , it does have several nearby continuum sources within @xmath103 to the south - east in projection ( @xmath104 kpc if the sources are at the same redshift ; see figure [ fig : pointingthumbs ] ) .",
    "however , these sources are outside of the mitchell spectrograph s fiber and the nirspec slit used by @xcite was not aligned to include them .",
    "@xcite explored the ly@xmath0  properties of close lbg pairs and found that all showed ly@xmath0  in emission when the projected separation was @xmath105 kpc .",
    "their work supports the picture of galaxy - galaxy interactions triggering star - formation and clearing gas and dust sufficiently for the ly@xmath0  photons produced in the starburst to escape the galaxies with high .",
    "@xcite also find that while the 1-d spectra of the close lbg pairs are often double - peaked , they are resolved spatially into two distinct offset ly@xmath0  lines and corresponding continua in 2-d spectra . for hps194 and hps251",
    ", this may be an alternative explanation for the multiple - peaked ly@xmath0  emission and why the expanding shell models poorly represent the data .",
    "however , our fiber - based ly@xmath0  spectra are spatially unresolved on the sky , so we can not investigate potential spatial offsets of the spectrally resolved ly@xmath0  emission components for these galaxies with the current data .",
    "as seen in figure [ fig : pointingthumbs ] , the potential companion sources for hps256 and the confirmed companion to hps251 are located outside of the mitchell spectrograph s fiber , even when considering the rms pointing uncertainty .",
    "yet , we still observe the multiple - peaked ly@xmath0  line profile morphology .",
    "this makes it more likely that the multiple - peaked and asymmetric nature of the ly@xmath0  line for these galaxies is a consequence of radiative transfer effects in a non - static medium rather than being the result of the integrated ly@xmath0  emission from multiple sources at similar redshift .",
    "since all three galaxies have at least one nearby continuum source within a projected distance of @xmath106 kpc and one of our galaxies has a _ confirmed _ companion within @xmath100 kpc , a possible link between galaxy - galaxy interactions and luminous ly@xmath0  emission should not be ignored .",
    "this has recently been explored in the context of labs by @xcite who post - process hydrodynamical simulations of gas - rich binary major mergers with a 3-d radiative transfer code .",
    "these authors find that such mergers produce copious ly@xmath0  emission ( with ly@xmath0  luminosity @xmath107 erg s@xmath4 ) that is extended over 20 - 50 kpc at @xmath108 as a result of shocked gas and the starburst induced by the gravitational interaction .",
    "these properties are similar to typical @xmath108 labs ( e.g. , @xcite ) . due to the observational and selection methods utilized in the hps @xcite , the @xmath33 observed for our three laes ( @xmath109 erg s@xmath4 ; see table [ table : galdata ] ) is of the same order as that predicted by the @xcite simulations .",
    "additionally , the _ total _ velocity widths of the ly@xmath0  emission for hps194 , hps256 , and hps251 are 667 , 612 , and 884 km s@xmath4 , respectively @xcite , which are each comparable to the median value of 780 km s@xmath4 for the labs of @xcite .",
    "however , since the ly@xmath0  spectra we present in this work supply no spatial information , we can not currently assess the extended nature of the three laes individually .",
    "the hps data is also of limited use in this regard due to the coarse spatial resolution and limited depth of the survey ( an upper limit of @xmath110 fwhm , which corresponds to the spatial resolution limit of the hps , can be placed on each lae s size ; @xcite ) .",
    "future deep , spatially resolved ly@xmath0  spectra will be useful in determining if our laes are significantly extended , which would provide further evidence for the interaction scenario based on the simulations by @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite used measurements of the sfr of bright laes ( hps194 and hps256 were among the galaxies in their sample ) along with measurements of their dynamical mass ( which were assumed to be the upper limit of their gas mass ) and sizes to compare such galaxies to existing star formation scaling relations .",
    "@xcite established that there are two distinct sequences of star formation in the kennicutt - schmidt @xmath111 vs. gas mass density @xmath112 plane : a temporally extended sequence for `` normal '' star - forming disk galaxies , and a more rapid sequence for starburst galaxies that was determined from measurements of sub - millimeter and ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( smgs and ulirgs , respectively ) .",
    "the latter scaling relation is offset above the former by 1.1 dex in the @xmath111 vs. @xmath112 plane .",
    "this bimodality between the star formation sequences of starburst and normal star - forming galaxies is largely due to the use of a bimodal conversion factor @xmath113 used to convert the observed carbon monoxide line luminosity @xmath114 to gas mass @xmath115 ( @xmath116 for normal star - forming galaxies and 0.8 for starburst galaxies ) .",
    "the measurements by @xcite suggest that laes lie above the scaling relation for normal star - forming galaxies and are consistent with the @xcite starburst sequence at the @xmath117 level .",
    "thus , laes appear to form stars more rapidly than a typical star - forming galaxy at a given @xmath112 .",
    "note that the bimodality of @xmath118 has recently been challenged by the simulations of @xcite .",
    "these authors show that while @xmath118 is systematically different for varying local galaxy conditions ( e.g. , metallicity and surface density ) , it varies smoothly among them .",
    "the result is a continuous , unimodal star formation scaling relation where the highest @xmath111 disk galaxies overlap with the inferred mergers ( i.e. , starburst galaxies ) .",
    "the measurements for laes by @xcite show that laes occupy a region in the @xmath111 vs. @xmath112 plane bounded by @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "data points within this bounded area are consistent with the scatter in the continuous star formation scaling relation of @xcite and lie in a region of elevated sfr density occupied by both high-@xmath121 disk galaxies and inferred mergers ( i.e. , low-@xmath121 ulirgs and high-@xmath121 smgs ) .",
    "thus , the star formation observed for luminous laes is consistent with ( but not necessarily suggestive of ) that expected from an interacting or merging system .    in this scenario , interactions could be responsible for dispersing gas and dust and allowing ly@xmath0  photons to escape through low column density ( i.e. , low optical depth ) `` windows '' in the overall neutral gas distribution . combined with a low dust optical depth ,",
    "the gravitationally induced burst of star formation could result in the large  we observe in addition to driving a strong large - scale outflow .",
    "ly@xmath0  radiative transfer through the dispersed ( i.e. , lower ) outflowing gas could give rise to the asymmetric , multiple - peaked ly@xmath0  line profiles with small ly@xmath0  velocity offsets , as compared to the ly@xmath0  spectra of lbgs that typically have large velocity offsets and smaller .",
    "interaction - induced inflows of gas ( resulting in star formation or shocks ) along the line of sight could also help to enhance the ly@xmath0  flux blueward of the line center .",
    "additionally , multiple blueward ly@xmath0  peaks ( such as that observed for hps256 and hps251 ) could also be produced from shocked and/or fluorescing gas that is infalling along different sight lines .",
    "the large blueshift ( @xmath6 km s@xmath4 ) of these ly@xmath0  peaks , however , likely indicates that such emitting material is not yet bound , unless radiative transfer effects couple favorably with the dynamics of the system to produce such large velocity offsets relative to the systemic velocity of the lae s  regions . to verify an interaction - based scenario for luminous laes , a larger sample of galaxies with confirmed redshifts for nearby companion continuum sources and spatially resolved ly@xmath0  spectra are needed .",
    "the irregular nature of these galaxies continuum morphologies and the confirmed and potential interactions with nearby companions may suggest that significant deviations away from ly@xmath0  point sources and spherical gas distributions and velocity fields are necessary for properly modeling ly@xmath0  radiative transfer through neutral gas on the galactic and circumgalactic scale .",
    "this conjecture is especially intriguing given that the two galaxies that are most poorly represented by the spherical expanding shell model ly@xmath0  spectra ( i.e. , hps194 and hps251 ) are the same two galaxies with the strongest evidence of an interaction .",
    "in this paper , we have obtained follow - up optical spectra of three laes drawn from the hetdex pilot survey @xcite with sufficient spectral resolution to resolve the ly@xmath0  emission line . with no preselection other than @xmath122 erg s@xmath4 @xmath29  ( which corresponds to @xmath123 erg s@xmath4 at @xmath124 )",
    ", we find that all three galaxies at 120 km s@xmath4 fwhm spectral resolution display multiple ly@xmath0  emission peaks . using the nir spectra of these galaxies rest - frame optical emission lines from @xcite and song et al .",
    "( 2013 , in preparation ) , we have determined the velocity structure of the ly@xmath0  emission relative to the systemic redshift of each galaxy .",
    "our main results are as follows :    \\1 ) the prominent double - peaks of the ly@xmath0  emission line for each lae straddles and is asymmetric about the velocity zero - point .",
    "the strongest emission peak is redshifted by 176 km s@xmath4 on average relative to the systemic velocity and its velocity offset and basic shape are strikingly similar among the three galaxies in our sample .",
    "we observe larger variations from galaxy to galaxy in the emission blueward of the systemic velocity , including two of the three galaxies that display two separate weak blueshifted emission peaks .",
    "the most blueshifted of these weak peaks for these two galaxies is offset from the systemic redshift by @xmath6 km s@xmath4 .",
    "however , the velocity offset of the redward peak and the peak - to - peak velocity separation between the two most prominent peaks that straddle the velocity zero - point are @xmath125 smaller for each lae than the same measurements made on average for ly@xmath0  emitting lbgs with similar ly@xmath0  line profile morphologies .",
    "this is true even when taking into account the spectral resolution differences for each sample .",
    "\\2 ) we have compared our ly@xmath0  spectra with the predicted line profiles of a grid of ly@xmath0  radiative transfer models in the popular and relatively idealized spherical expanding shell geometry to model large - scale galactic outflows .",
    "in contrast to the findings of works such as @xcite for single - peaked asymmetric ly@xmath0  line profiles , we observe several key discrepancies between the best - fitting models and the data . visually , the redshifted ly@xmath0  emission component is acceptably reproduced by models with low column density of neutral gas ( @xmath88 @xmath29 ) . however , the blueshifted emission component ubiquitously has too little flux as compared to the data and has an incorrect velocity offset relative to the systemic velocity for two of the three galaxies ( hps194 and hps251 ) .",
    "additionally , ly@xmath0  radiative transfer through an expanding shell can not produce the highly blueshifted emission peak that is observed for hps256 and hps251 .",
    "\\3 ) based on the above analysis , we caution against equating an observed velocity offset of ly@xmath0  directly with an outflow or inflow velocity , especially at low spectral resolutions where the ly@xmath0  line profile is unresolved and the intrinsic asymmetry of the emission line can bias the velocity offset measurement .",
    "the measured velocity offset , especially for unresolved ly@xmath0  spectra , is a complex function of many parameters describing the neutral gas , especially the column density  due to its large dynamic range and ability to significantly change the width and asymmetry of the emission components .",
    "additionally , the ly@xmath0  line profile shape and the resulting velocity offset can also be highly dependent on the viewing angle for more realistic , non - spherical gas geometries .",
    "\\4 ) for luminous laes with @xmath123 erg s@xmath4 , like those in the hps lae sample , galaxy - galaxy interactions may play a significant role in producing and aiding the escape of copious ly@xmath0  photons and in shaping the emergent line profile by inducing star formation and clearing gas and dust .",
    "such gravitational interactions may cause deviations away from spherical neutral gas geometries and velocity fields , such as those modeled in our expanding shell radiative transfer simulations .",
    "the effects of a non - spherical outflow in addition to simultaneous inflow of neutral gas , as well as smaller - scale ly@xmath0  radiative transfer effects within the ism that are not captured in the expanding shell model could all contribute to the discrepancies we observe between the ly@xmath0  spectra of these galaxies and the predictions of the models .",
    "in forthcoming work , we will extend this study to obtain spectrally resolved ly@xmath0  line profiles of a larger sample of @xmath126 high  laes using multi - object techniques . of particular importance in the forthcoming work will be the ability to obtain at least one dimension of spatial information .",
    "the combination of a larger sample and @xmath1271-d spectra will allow us to not only investigate the frequencies of various ly@xmath0  line profile morphologies among this unique sample , but also investigate the spatial distribution and possible extended nature of the ly@xmath0  emission .",
    "the latter may provide important constraints on the emission and escape mechanisms of ly@xmath0  photons from these systems .",
