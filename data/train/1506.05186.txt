    "a3 ) and the additional segments in fig .",
    "a3 , is a topologically trivial loop in @xmath86 .",
    "if we start with @xmath87 , at the end of the circuit we have , @xmath88 then , the corresponding path @xmath89 is closed and , as @xmath6 is simply connected , it can be deformed to a point in r , without further singularities .",
    "this discussion motivates a different situation involving a pair of frame singularities on the sphere @xmath22 around a point , which is not equivalent to a normal center vortex .",
    "let us consider a mapping that on a disk minus a hole is defined as shown in fig .",
    "b1   b2   b3    when the green and red circles ( oriented as in the figure ) are followed , the frame is rotated with @xmath79 and @xmath90 , respectively .",
    "we note that in principle there are no obstructions to extended this behaviour inside the grey region . in effect , the loop @xmath84 defined on the composition of the two coloured circles and the additional segments in fig .",
    "b1 is topologically trivial in @xmath86 .",

    "this is analogous to what happens in bcs superconductors .",
    "they are understood in terms of microscopic degrees , where the electron - phonon interaction leads to cooper pairs that condense , as well as via the guinzburg - landau model , that captures the main physics of the condensate . from this point of view",
    ", we may wonder what is the ensemble of magnetic degrees underlying the effective models discussed in previous sections .",
    "this type of question has been extensively considered in other contexts , ranging from compact qed in three and four dimensions @xcite to polymer field theory @xcite .    from the beginning",
    ", it is easy to advance that adjoint higgs fields should be obtained as an effective description of pointlike magnetic degrees carrying adjoint charges .",
    "the quantitative relationship between both phenomenological models , namely , the effective description and the corresponding ensemble , was initiated in @xcite .",

    "these are those terms involving a pair of flavours in our previously discussed effective model .",
    "the detailed knowledge about hadron states and interquark potentials observed in the lattice , for different groups and representations , should guide the search for the natural dual superconductor model . how to accomodate casimir scaling at intermediate distances , asymptotic @xmath0-ality , and the interquark potential in normal and hybrid states ?",
    "we believe that hybrid states , with their intrinsic non abelian features , are ideal to guide this quest .",
    "confined valence gluons can be identified with confined non abelian monopoles , that can interpolate a pair of strings with different colours .",
    "note that the experimental search for hybrid states will start running this year at the gluex facility .",
    "another important point is that in order to describe @xmath0-ality , the dual superconductor must be based on a set of adjoint higgs fields .",
    "as explained in  6 , this type of model could be an effective description of _ quantum _ ensembles containing monopole degrees of freedom that carry adjoint @xmath1 charges .",
    "thus , while abelian projected monopoles are not good at desribing @xmath0-ality , the non abelian degrees could be an alternative / complementary source to ensembles of _ quantum _ center vortices and their ensuing properties .",
