    "the origin and omnipresence of @xmath0 noise is one of the oldest problems of the contemporary physics . since the first observation of the flicker noise in the currents of electron tubes by johnson @xcite , fluctuations of signals and physical variables exhibiting behavior characterized by a power spectral density diverging at low frequencies like @xmath0",
    "have been observed in a wide variety of systems @xcite .",
    "the widespread occurrence suggest that some underlying mechanism might exist .",
    "however , a fully satisfactory explanation has not yet been found and the general theory of @xmath0 noise is still an open question .",
    "a simple procedures of integration or differentiation of the convenient ( white noise , brownian motion or so ) fluctuating signals do not yield in the signal exhibiting @xmath0 noise .",
    "there are no simple linear , even stochastic , differential equations generating signals with @xmath0 noise .",
    "therefore , @xmath0 noise is often modeled as the superposition of lorentzian spectra with a wide range of relaxation times @xcite .",
    "summation or integration of the lorentzians with the appropriate weights may yield @xmath0 noise @xcite .    in many cases the physical processes",
    "can be represented by a sequence of random pulses .",
    "recently , considering signals and currents as consisting of pulses we have shown @xcite that the intrinsic origin of @xmath0 noise may be a brownian motion of the interevent time of the signal pulses , similar to the brownian fluctuations of the signal amplitude , resulting in @xmath1 noise .",
    "the model , proposed in @xcite , can be extended taking into account finite duration of the pulse .",
    "the spectrum of the signal , consisting of the pulse sequences which belong to the class of markov process , was investigated in @xcite .    in this article",
    "we present a different model of pulses .",
    "we consider a signal consisting of a sequence of uncorrelated pulses .",
    "the shape of the pulses is determined by only one random parameter  pulse duration .",
    "we will show that by suitably choosing of the distribution of the pulse duration the @xmath0 noise can be obtained .",
    "we will investigate a signal consisting from a sequence of pulses .",
    "we assume that :    1 .",
    "the pulse sequences are stationary and ergodic ; 2 .   interevent times and",
    "the shapes of different pulses are independent .",
    "the general form of such signal can be written as @xmath2 where functions @xmath3 determine the shape of individual pulses and time moments @xmath4 determine when a pulse occurs .",
    "the power spectrum is given by the equation @xmath5 where @xmath6 .",

    ". then equation ( [ eq : spectr2 ] ) yields the power spectrum @xmath33 this is the spectrum of one pulse multiplied by the spectrum of the sequence of @xmath34-shaped pulses @xmath35 .",
