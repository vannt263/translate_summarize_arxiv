    "by now it has become evident that stripes play an important role in the understanding of cuprate high - t@xmath0 superconductors.@xcite this is certainly true for materials where the underlying lattice breaks @xmath1 symmetry such as the ltt phase of e.g. la@xmath2nd@xmath3sr@xmath4cuo@xmath5 or la@xmath6ba@xmath4cuo@xmath5 ( lbco).@xcite the situation is , however , complicated by the presence of disorder and grains which can pin stripes and restore global @xmath1 symmetry . in intrinsically disordered materials such as",
    "la@xmath6sr@xmath4cuo@xmath5 ( lsco ) experiments have shown that a static magnetic signal persists well into the superconducting dome and vanishes around a doping level of @xmath7.@xcite    theoretically , the stripe disorder has been studied within a variety of models.@xcite in particular , a mean - field unrestricted hartree - fock study including potential disorder to model dopant and substitutional impurities demonstrated how disorder slows - down the spin fluctuations , which eventually freeze out and form a disordered low - temperature static stripe phase.@xcite the same picture applies in the presence of vortices generated by a magnetic field.@xcite    another candidate for pinning centers of stripe fluctuations is local ltt regions embedded in the lto matrix .",
    "this is relevant in , for example , lsco where various experimental studies have detected local ltt distortions caused by disorder , dopants , and grain boundaries.@xcite the ltt phase is clearly also relevant for lbco where it exists as the preferred bulk crystal structure around 1/8 doping.@xcite in this bulk ltt phase it is well - known from experimental studies that electron - lattice coupling is important for pinning of stripes.@xcite in lsco the static spin signal also peaks close to 1/8 doping@xcite possibly due to disordered local ltt centers dominating the pinning near that doping level .",
    "in order to study the ltt - pinned stripes in @xmath8-wave superconductors ( dsc ) , we self - consistently solve the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equations on a square lattice for the mean - field hamiltonian    @xmath9    where the hopping amplitudes between nearest - neighbor and next - nearest - neighbor sites _",

    "i _ is given by @xmath16 , and the self - consistent quantities are : @xmath17    where @xmath18 is an attractive pairing interaction strength .",
    "a standard bogoliubov transformation leads to the bdg matrix equation @xmath19 with the matrix elements defined by @xmath20 these can be solved self - consistently by iterative updates of the pairing potential @xmath21 , the charge density @xmath22 and the local magnetization @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the temperature .",

    "[ magnandldos ] we show the resulting magnetization in a system with a @xmath38 ltt patch in the center of the system . the local ltt mechanism for stripe pinning does not contain impurity resonances but the induced magnetism may , depending on band parameters and @xmath39 , cause a in - gap kink similar to coexisting phases of dsc and af.@xcite in the present case , however , the spatial modulations of the ldos upon entering the ltt stripe region exist near the gap edges as seen in fig .",

    "[ magnandldos ] , the ldos inside the pinned stripe region exhibits a vhs clearly separated from the coherence peak , whereas for the pure dsc phase these two peaks merge and result in the overall appearance of slightly particle - hole asymmetric coherence peaks . in real samples",
    "such features in the ldos will coexist with additional nano - scale gap variations arising from e.g. dopant disorder and pseudo - gap phases , and would therefore be very difficult to extract .",
    "the vhs appearing as a ( logarithmic ) peak in the dos is generally not observed in the cuprates due either to disorder effects similar to fig .",

    "the present real - space approach allows a direct simulation of such a granular normal state - superconductor surface .",
