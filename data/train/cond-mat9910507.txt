    "silicate melts and glasses are an important class of materials in very different fields , e.g.  in geosciences ( since silicates are geologically the most relevant materials ) and in technology ( windows , containers , and optical fibers ) . from a physical point of view",
    "it is a very challenging task to understand the properties of these materials on a microscopic level , and in the last twenty years many studies on different systems have shown that molecular dynamics computer simulations are a very appropriate tool for this purpose ( angell _ et al .",
    "_ , 1981 , balucani and zoppi , 1994 , kob , 1999 ) .",
    "the main advantage of such simulations is that they give access to the whole microscopic information in form of the particle trajectories which of course can not be determined in real experiments .    in pure silica ( sio@xmath2 )",
    "the structure is that of a disordered tetrahedral network in which sio@xmath1 tetrahedra are connected via the oxygens at the edges . in a recent simulation ( horbach and kob , 1999a ) we have studied in detail the statics and dynamics of pure silica . in the present paper",
    "we investigate the statics and dynamics of melts in which the network modifier sodium is added to a silica melt . in particular two sodium silicate systems are discussed , namely sodium disilicate ( na@xmath2si@xmath2o@xmath3 ) and sodium trisilicate ( na@xmath2si@xmath4o@xmath5 ) to which will be referred to ns2 and ns3 , respectively .    in recent years",
    "several authors found , by using the potential proposed by vessal _",
    "( 1989 ) that , e.g. , ns2 is characterized by a microsegregation in which the sodium atoms form clusters of a few atoms between bridged sio@xmath1 units ( vessal _ et al .",
    "_ , 1992 , smith _ et al .",
    "_ , 1995 , cormack and cao , 1997 ) .",
    "this result is somewhat surprising because in experiments one observes a phase separation between na@xmath2o and sio@xmath2 at lower temperatures and more likely in sodium silicates with a higher sio@xmath2 concentration ( mazurin _ et al .",
    "_ , 1970 , haller _ et al .",
    "_ , 1974 ) .",
    "in order to see whether microsegregation is also reproduced with a different model from the one of vessal _",
    "et al . _",
    "we have performed our simulations with a different potential ( discussed below ) .    up to now the dynamics of systems like alkali silicates",
    "was investigated by studying only the dynamics of the alkali atoms which , at lower temperatures , is much faster than that of the silicon and oxygen atoms . in this paper",
    "we therefore present the results for the diffusion dynamics of all components in ns2 and ns3 as well as the microscopic mechanism of diffusion in these systems .",
    "in a classical molecular dynamics computer simulation one solves numerically newton s equations of motion for a many particle system .",
    "if quantum mechanical effects can be neglected such simulations are able to give in principle a realistic description of any molecular system .",
    "the determining factor of how well the properties of a real material are reproduced by a md simulation is the potential with which the interaction between the atoms is described .",
    "the model potential we use to compute the interaction between the ions in sodium silicates is the one proposed by kramer _",
    "et al . _  ( 1991 ) which is a generalization of the so called bks potential ( van beest _",
    "et al . _ , 1990 ) for pure silica .",
    "it has the following functional form : @xmath6 .",
    "\\label{eq1}\\ ] ] here @xmath7 is the distance between an ion of type @xmath8 and an ion of type @xmath9 .",
    "the values of the parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 can be found in the original publication .",
    "the potential ( [ eq1 ] ) has been optimized by kramer _",
    "et al . _  for zeolites ,",
    "i.e.  for systems that have al ions in addition to si , na and o. in that paper the authors used for silicon and oxygen the _ partial _ charges @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively , whereas sodium was assigned its real ion charge @xmath14 . with this choice charge neutrality",
    "is not fulfilled in sodium silicate systems . to overcome this problem we introduced for the sodium ions a distance dependent charge @xmath15 instead of @xmath16 , @xmath17 \\right ) &           r < r_{{\\rm c } } \\\\        0.6   & r \\geq r_{{\\rm c } }      \\end{array } \\right . \\label{eq2}\\ ] ] which means that for @xmath18 charge neutrality is valid ( @xmath19 for @xmath18 ) .",
    "note that @xmath15 is continuous at @xmath20 .",
    "we have fixed the parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 such that the experimental mass density of ns2 and the static structure factor from a neutron scattering experiment are reproduced well . from this",
    "fitting we have obtained the values @xmath22    and @xmath23  @xmath24 . with this choice the charge @xmath15 crosses smoothly over from @xmath25 at @xmath26   to @xmath19 for @xmath18 .",
    "the simulations have been done at constant volume with the density of the system fixed to @xmath27 .",
    "the systems consist of @xmath28 and @xmath29 ions for ns2 and ns3 , respectively .",
    "the reason for using such a relatively large system size is that , like in sio@xmath2 ( horbach _ et al .",
    "_ , 1996 , horbach _ et al .",
    "_ , 1999b ) , strong finite size effects are present in the dynamics of smaller systems which have to be avoided ( horbach and kob , 1999c ) . the equations of motion were integrated with the velocity form of the verlet algorithm and the coulombic contributions to the potential and the forces were calculated via ewald summation .",
    "the time step of the integration was @xmath30  fs . the temperatures investigated are @xmath31  k , @xmath32  k , @xmath33  k , @xmath34  k , @xmath35  k , @xmath36  k , @xmath37  k , and in addition for ns2 also @xmath38  k. the temperature of the system was controlled by coupling it to a stochastic heat bath , i.e.  by substituting periodically the velocities of the particles with the ones from a maxwell - boltzmann distribution with the correct temperature . after the system was equilibrated at the target temperature , we continued the run in the microcanonical ensemble , i.e.  the heat bath was switched off . in order to improve the statistics we have done two independent runs at each temperature .",
    "the production runs have been up to @xmath39  ns real time which corresponds to @xmath40 million time steps . in the temperature range under investigation",
    "the pressure decreases monotonically from @xmath41  gpa to @xmath42  gpa in the case of ns3 and from @xmath43  gpa to @xmath44  gpa in the case of ns2 . in order to make a comparison of the static structure factor for ns2 from our simulation with one from a neutron scattering experiment ( see below )",
    "we have also determined the structures of the glass at @xmath45  k. the glass state was produced by cooling the system from equilibrated configurations at @xmath46  k with a cooling rate of @xmath47 .",
    "the pressure of the system at @xmath45  k is @xmath48  gpa .    in the following",
    "we compare the properties of ns2 and ns3 with those of pure silica which we have investigated in recent simulation . the details of the latter can be found in horbach and kob ( 1999a ) .",
    "we only mention here that these simulations were done also at the density @xmath49 in the temperature range @xmath50 for a system of 8016 particles .",
    "the two production runs at the lowest temperature were over about 20 ns real time , and the pressure at this temperature is @xmath51  gpa .",
    "in order to investigate the local environment of an atom in a disordered structure , especially at high temperatures , it is useful to calculate the coordination number @xmath52 which gives the number of atoms of type @xmath53 $ ] surrounding an atom of type @xmath54 $ ] within a distance @xmath55 .",
    "note that @xmath52 is essentially the integral from @xmath56 to @xmath57 over the function @xmath58 , where @xmath59 denotes the pair correlation function for @xmath60 correlations ( balucani and zoppi , 1994 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a we show @xmath61 and @xmath62 for sio@xmath2 at @xmath63  k and for ns3 and ns2 at @xmath64  k. in both quantities we observe a strong increase for distances from @xmath65   to @xmath26   at which the functions reach a plateau which persists up to about @xmath66   . for distances",
    "@xmath67   there is no such step like behavior because of the disorder . the vertical lines in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a at @xmath68    and @xmath69    correspond to the first maximum and the first minimum in @xmath70 , respectively . in @xmath71",
    "the plateau is essentially at @xmath72 in sio@xmath2 as well as in the sodium silicate systems which means that most of the silicon atoms , i.e.  more than 99  % , are surrounded by four oxygen atoms thus forming a tetrahedron . in the case of sio@xmath2",
    "there is also a plateau essentially at @xmath73 in the same @xmath7 interval .",
    "therefore , in this system most of the the oxygen atoms are bridging oxygens between two tetrahedra , and thus the system seems to form a perfect disordered tetrahedral network even at the relatively high temperature @xmath63  k. indeed we found that at this temperature less than one percent of the silicon and oxygen atoms are defects ( horbach and kob , 1999a ) . for ns3 and ns2 a plateau is formed at @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively",
    "this is due to the fact that only a part of the oxygen atoms are bridging oxygens , namely @xmath76 % in the case of ns2 and @xmath77 % in the case of ns3 .",
    "most of the other oxygen atoms form dangling bonds with one silicon neighbor ( 28.4  % in ns2 and 22.7  % in ns3 at @xmath78 ) or they are not nearest neighbors of silicon atoms ( 3.1  % in ns2 and 6.0  % in ns3 at @xmath78 ) .",
    "the local environment of the sodium atoms is characterized by @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 in fig .",
    "[ fig1]b . in these quantities",
    "there is no step like behavior also at small distances . at @xmath82 , which is approximately at @xmath83   for ns3 and ns2 , the apparent coordination number @xmath84 is too small in comparison with x  ray experiments",
    "from which one would expect a value between 5 and 6 ( see brown _ et al .",
    "_ , 1995 , and references therein ) .",
    "also @xmath85   is too small in comparison with the values found in x  ray experiments which are between 2.3    and 2.6   .",
    "we recognize in fig .",
    "[ fig1]b that in the case of ns2 the functions @xmath81 and @xmath86 are relatively close to each other for @xmath87   .",
    "so at @xmath88 and @xmath89 the apparent coordination numbers are @xmath90 and @xmath91 , respectively , i.e. , are quite similar .",
    "in contrast to that , the coordination numbers in ns3 at @xmath92 and @xmath89 are @xmath93 and @xmath94 , respectively , which means that there is a substitution effect in ns3 such that more silicon atoms are on average in the neighborhood of an sodium atom than in ns2 because there are less sodium atoms in ns3 .",
    "therefore , in ns2 as well as in ns3 every sodium atom has on average about 16 silicon and sodium atoms in its neighborhood .",
    "the structure of ns2 and ns3 can be studied in more detail by looking at the so called @xmath0 species which can be determined experimentally by nmr ( stebbins , 1995 ) and by raman spectroscopy ( mcmillan and wolf , 1995 ) .",
    "@xmath0 is defined as the fraction of sio@xmath1 tetrahedra with @xmath95 bridging oxygens in the system . in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a we have seen that these structural elements are very well defined also at temperatures as high as @xmath64  k. from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we recognize that at @xmath64 k there is essentially a ternary distribution of @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 both in ns2 and in ns3 . at higher temperatures",
    "there is also a significant contribution of silicon defects , i.e.  three and five  fold coordinated silicon atoms ( denoted as rest in the figure ) , and of @xmath99 species . for @xmath100",
    "k the curves for @xmath96 are well described by arrhenius laws @xmath101 ( bold solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) with activation energies @xmath102 k and @xmath103 k for ns2 and ns3 , respectively . if we extrapolate these arrhenius laws to low temperatures we recognize from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] that the @xmath96 species essentially disappear slightly above the experimental glass transition temperatures @xmath104 for ns2 and ns3 , which are at 740 k and 760 k ( knoche _ et al . _ , 1994 ) , respectively . therefore ,",
    "if we would be able to equilibrate our systems down to @xmath105 we would expect a binary distribution of @xmath97 and @xmath98 species in the glass state of ns2 and ns3 . also included in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is the @xmath0 species distribution for ns2 at @xmath45 k which we have calculated from the configurations which we have produced by cooling down the system from @xmath46  k to @xmath45  k with a cooling rate of @xmath106  @xmath107 .",
    "we recognize from the data that the @xmath0 species distribution essentially coincides at @xmath45 k with the one at @xmath64  k , which is due to the fact that the liquid structure at the latter temperature has just been frozen in . if we extrapolate the data from @xmath37 k to lower temperatures allowing further relaxation we would expect about 45 % @xmath97 and 55 % @xmath98 in the case of ns3 and about 40 % @xmath97 and 60 % @xmath98 in the case of ns2 at @xmath105 .",
    "in contrast to these values one finds in nmr and raman experiments 60 % @xmath97 and 40 % @xmath98 in the case of ns3 and 92 % @xmath97 and 8 % @xmath98 in the case of ns2 ( stebbins , 1988 , mysen and frantz , 1992 , sprenger _",
    "et al . _ , 1992 ,",
    "knoche , 1993 ) .",
    "thus our simple model is not able to describe the @xmath0 species reliably .",
    "the reason for this is probably that our model gives a slightly wrong coordination function @xmath79 as we have mentioned before .",
    "so far we have looked at the local environment of the atoms . in order to investigate the structure on a larger length scale useful quantities are the partial static structure factors , @xmath108 depending on the magnitude of the wave",

    "the peak at @xmath121  @xmath117 in @xmath114 is due to the period of oscillations in @xmath122 .",
    "moreover , the temperature dependence we observe for the peaks at @xmath116  @xmath117 and @xmath121  @xmath117 is relatively weak . at @xmath64",
    "k a peak is visible at @xmath26  @xmath117 in @xmath113 for ns2 and ns3 , which is the so called first sharp diffraction peak ( fsdp ) .",
    "this feature arises from the tetrahedral network structure since the length scale which corresponds to it , i.e.  @xmath123 , is approximately the spatial extent of two connected sio@xmath1 tetrahedra .",
    "only a shoulder can be identified in @xmath113 for @xmath115  k at the position of the fsdp because the network structure is less pronounced than at @xmath64  k. in agreement with the aforementioned interpretation of the fsdp this feature is absent in the na  na correlations .",
    "we note that this holds also for the na  o and si  na correlations .",
    "we see therefore that the structure in ns2 is characterized by a partially destroyed tetrahedral network , and that on the other hand there are the sodium atoms which are homogeneously distributed in the system having on average 16 sodium and silicon neighbors .",
    "we would therefore expect that there is a characteristic length scale of regions where the network is destroyed and where the sodium atoms are located .",
    "this explains the peak at @xmath124  @xmath117 in the @xmath125 corresponding to a length scale @xmath126    which is approximately two times the mean distance of nearest na  na or na  si neighbors .",

    "very well reproduced is the peak at @xmath138  @xmath117 .",
    "the peak at @xmath124 @xmath117 is not present in the experimental data which might be due to the fact that this feature is less pronounced in real systems .",
    "one of the simplest quantities to study the dynamics of liquids is the self diffusion constant @xmath139 for a tagged particle of type @xmath8 , which can be calculated from the mean squared displacement @xmath140 via the einstein relation , @xmath141 the different @xmath139 for ns2 and ns3 are shown in fig .",

    "the corresponding activation energies @xmath145 are in very good agreement with the experimental values by brbec _",
    "et al . _  ( 1980 ) and mikkelsen ( 1984 ) ( given in the figure ) .",
    "we recognize from fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] that the dynamics in the sodium silicate melts is much faster than in sio@xmath2 even at the relatively high temperature @xmath63  k ( @xmath146 ) for which @xmath142 and @xmath143 are about two orders of magnitude larger in ns2 and ns3 than in sio@xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , we see that the sodium diffusion constants can be fitted in the whole temperature range very well with arrhenius laws .",
    "the corresponding activation energies are @xmath147  ev for ns2 and @xmath148  ev for ns3 .",
    "these activation energies are about 20 % to 30 % higher than those obtained from electrical conductivity measurements ( greaves and ngai , 1995 , and references therein ) . but this discrepancy might at least be partly due to the fact that our simulations are done at relatively high pressures .",
    "with decreasing temperature @xmath149 decouples more and more from @xmath143 and @xmath142 in ns2 and ns3 .",
    "therefore , at least at low temperatures , the motion of the oxygen and silicon atoms is frozen with respect to the timescale of motion of the sodium atoms .",
    "experimentally the diffusion constants for oxygen and silicon have been measured by poe _",
    "et al . _  ( 1997 ) for the system na@xmath2si@xmath1o@xmath150 at high temperatures and high pressures .",
    "besides a few other combinations of temperature and pressure they determined @xmath142 and @xmath151 at @xmath152  k and @xmath153  gpa where they found the values @xmath154",
    "@xmath155 and @xmath156  @xmath155 .",
    "in order to make a comparison with these values we have done a simulation of na@xmath2si@xmath1o@xmath150 for a system of @xmath157 particles at the density @xmath158  @xmath159 . at this density",
    "we have found at @xmath152  k and @xmath160  gpa the diffusion constants @xmath161  @xmath155 , @xmath162  @xmath155 , and @xmath163  @xmath155 .",
    "thus @xmath142 and @xmath143 from our simulation underestimate the experimental data by less than @xmath164% which is within the error bars of the experiment .",
    "therefore it seems that our model gives a quite realistic description of the diffusion in sodium silicate melts .    in order to give insight into the microscopic mechanism which is responsible for the diffusion of the different species in ns2 and ns3 we discuss now the time dependence of the probability @xmath165 that a bond between an atom of type @xmath8 and an atom of type @xmath9 is present at time @xmath166 when it was present at time zero . for this",
    "we define two atoms as bonded if their distance from each other is less than the location of the first minimum @xmath167 in the corresponding partial pair correlation function @xmath59 . in the following",
    "we restrict our discussion to ns2 because the conclusions which are drawn below also hold for ns3 . from the functions @xmath59 for ns2 we find for @xmath167 the values @xmath168   , @xmath169   , @xmath170   , @xmath169   , @xmath171   , and @xmath172    for the si ",

    "[ fig6 ] shows @xmath173 for the different temperatures .",
    "first of all we recognize from this figure that a plateau is formed on an intermediate time scale which becomes more and more pronounced the lower the temperature is .",
    "this plateau is due to the fact that at @xmath174 the amplitude of @xmath175 is equal @xmath176 and not zero .",
    "thus there are some sodium atoms which vibrate between the first and the second neighbor shell leading to the first fast decay of @xmath177 to the plateau value . in the long time regime of @xmath177 , where it decays from the plateau to zero",
    ", its shape seems to be independent of temperature .",
    "this is also true for the functions @xmath178 for the other correlations .",
    "for this reason it makes sense to define the lifetime @xmath179 of a bond between two atoms of type @xmath8 and @xmath9 as the time at which @xmath178 has decayed to @xmath180 .",
    "indeed , if the function @xmath173 for the different temperatures is plotted versus the scaled time @xmath181 ( inset of fig .  [ fig6 ] )",
    "one obtains one master curve in the long time regime @xmath182 .",
    "this master curve can not be described by an exponential function but is well described by a kohlrausch  williams  watts ( kww ) function , @xmath183 with an exponent @xmath184 , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] in which this function is fitted to the curve for @xmath46  k.    the lifetimes @xmath179 can now be correlated with the diffusion constants by plotting different products @xmath185 versus temperature , which is done in fig .",
    "the product @xmath186 is essentially constant over the whole temperature range whereas @xmath187 increases with decreasing temperature .",
    "this means that the elementary diffusion step for the sodium diffusion is related to the breaking of an na  na bond and not to that of an na  o bond , although the nearest neighbor distance is smaller for na  o ( @xmath188   ) than for na  na ( @xmath189   ) .",
    "we mention that an arrhenius law holds also for @xmath190 for which we have found the activation energy @xmath191 ev .",
    "the latter can be interpreted as an effective na  o binding energy in ns2 . in ns3 @xmath190",
    "can be fitted with an arrhenius law for @xmath192  k , the binding energy in this case is @xmath193 ev .",
    "also constant is the product @xmath194 which shows that the oxygen diffusion is related to the breaking of si  o bonds .",
    "in contrast to that @xmath195 is only constant at high temperatures . for temperatures",
    "@xmath196 k this product decreases with decreasing temperature . concerning the oxygen and silicon diffusion we have found recently that the same conclusions hold also for pure silica ( horbach and kob , 1999a ) .",
    "we have seen that the temperature dependence of @xmath143 and @xmath142 for sio@xmath2 changes strongly with the addition of sodium atoms and , moreover , diffusion becomes much faster . in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] we compare the behavior of the quantity @xmath197 for ns2 , ns3 and sio@xmath2 at @xmath63  k. we recognize that the shape of the curves seems to be the same for the three systems .",
    "the only difference lies in the time scale which is , as expected from the behavior of the diffusion constants , about two orders of magnitudes larger for silica than the sodium silicate systems .",
    "that the shape of the curves is indeed the same for the three systems is demonstrated in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] in which we have plotted the same data as before versus the scaled time @xmath198 .",
    "we see that the three curves fall nicely onto one master curve which can be fitted by a kww law with exponent @xmath199 .",
    "this is an astonishing result for @xmath200 since the local environment of the oxygen atoms is very different in the sodium silicate systems from that in silica .",
    "further insight on how diffusion takes place in sodium silicates can be gained from the self part of the van hove correlation function which is defined by ( balucani and zoppi , 1994 ) @xmath201 thus @xmath202 is the probability to find a particle a distance @xmath7 away from the place it was at @xmath203 . in figs .",
    "[ fig9]a and [ fig9]b we show this probability for different times at @xmath64 k for sodium and oxygen , respectively .",

    "[ fig9]a ) .",
    "the first peak is still located at the same position as it was at @xmath204 ps while its amplitude has decreased . thus we can conclude from this that the sodium atoms do not diffuse in a continuous way but discontinuously in time by hopping on average over the distance @xmath208 .",
    "this interpretation was first given for similar features in a soft  sphere system by roux _",
    "et al . _  ( 1989 ) . at @xmath209",
    "ps even a third peak has developed at @xmath210 while the first two peaks remain at the same position .",
    "this means that many sodium atoms have performed now a second diffusion step .",
    "we see from this that two successive elementary diffusion steps , each corresponding to a breaking of a na  na bond , are spatially highly correlated with each other . at @xmath211 ps the function has lost its three peak structure but the first peak is still observable with a significant amplitude .    whereas many of the sodium atoms have performed two elementary diffusion steps at @xmath209 ps the amplitude of the first peak for oxygen ( fig .",
    "[ fig9]b ) decreases only from about 1.5 to 0.8 in the time interval @xmath212 . in this time interval",
    "most of the oxygen atoms sit in the cage which is formed by the neighboring atoms and only rattle around in this cage .",
    "nevertheless , in this time window a shoulder becomes more and more pronounced around the mean distance between two nearest oxygen neighbors @xmath213  .",
    "this means that also the oxygen diffusion takes place by activated hopping events .",
    "we have found the same behavior for oxygen at low temperatures in pure silica ( horbach and kob , 1999a ) .",
    "by using a simple pair potential we have performed large scale molecular dynamics simulations in order to investigate the dynamic properties of the two sodium silicate melts na@xmath2si@xmath2o@xmath3 ( ns2 ) and na@xmath2si@xmath4o@xmath5 ( ns3 ) .",
    "the structure of these two systems can be characterized by a partially destroyed tetrahedral sio@xmath1 network , and a homogeneous distribution of sodium atoms which have on average about 16 sodium and silicon atoms as nearest neighbors .",
    "the regions in between the network structure introduce a new length scale which is about two times the distance of nearest na  na or na  si neighbors .",
    "this leads to a peak in the static structure factor at @xmath124  @xmath117 .",
    "furthermore , we have found no evidence in the static structure factor that a microsegregation of na@xmath2o complexes takes place .",
    "a comparison of experimental data to the one of our computer simulation shows that the latter gives a fair description of the static properties of ns2 and ns3 .",
    "we have explicitly demonstrated this by showing that the static structure factor @xmath128 from a neutron scattering experiment for ns2 ( misawa _ et al . _ , 1980 )",
    "is reproduced quite well by our simulation .",
    "in contrast to our simulation this experiment exhibits no peak at @xmath124  @xmath117 which might be due to the fact that this feature is less pronounced in real systems .",
    "our simulations give not a very good description for the @xmath0 species distribution which is perhaps due to the fact that our model underestimates the coordination number of nearest na  o neighbors .",
    "nevertheless the oxygen and silicon diffusion constants for na@xmath2si@xmath1o@xmath150 are in very good agreement with experimental data by poe _",
    "et al . _  ( 1997 ) . in comparing the diffusion constants in ns2 and ns3 with those in silica",
    "we have recognized that the dynamics becomes much faster with the addition of the sodium atoms . moreover , in the sodium silicates the diffusion constant for sodium decouples for decreasing temperature more and more from those of oxygen and silicon , such that at low temperatures the dynamics of the silicon and oxygen atoms is frozen in with respect to the movement of the sodium atoms .",
    "the sodium diffusion constants for ns2 and ns3 exhibit over the whole temperature range we investigate an arrhenius behavior with activation energies around @xmath214  ev .",
    "we have shown that our simulation is able to give insight into the microscopic mechanism of diffusion in ns2 and ns3 . from the time dependent bond probability",
    "@xmath215 we determined an average lifetime @xmath179 of bonds between an atom of type @xmath8 and an atom of type @xmath9 . by correlating the lifetimes @xmath179 with the diffusion constants , we show that the elementary diffusion step in the case of sodium is the breaking of a na ",
    "na bond and in the case of oxygen that of a si  o bond . by studying the self part of the van hove correlation function we have demonstrated that at low temperatures the diffusion for oxygen and sodium takes place by activated hopping events over the mean distance @xmath216    and @xmath207   , respectively .",
    "moreover , we have found for the case of sodium that at least two successive diffusion steps are spatially highly correlated with each other .",
