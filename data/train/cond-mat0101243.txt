    "323 - 360 ( 2001 ) * the interpretation of the normal and superconducting state far infrared region ( fir ) properties of metals is still rather ambiguous . in this lecture",
    "i will restrict myself to the consideration of the of isotropic single wide band ( isb ) model based on the nam formalism @xcite . * from the optical conductivity @xmath8 one derives the so called transport spectral function @xmath9 .",
    "it has the same spectral structure , i.e.  the same number of peaks with similar relative positions ( see fig.4 in @xcite and fig.1 in @xcite ) as a standard @xmath0 which enters the eliashberg equations .",
    "but their amplitudes can be lower , and as a result the transport coupling constant @xmath10 is less than the standard @xmath11 . in this lecture",
    "i will not distinct the @xmath0 and @xmath9 . *",
    "if the electronic band is very narrow , the forward scattering could dominate . in this case the optical properties manifests themselves by the negligible coupling , while the tunnelling spectroscopy gives reasonable finite coupling strength .",
    "a similar problem arises when the quasiparticles from the flat or nested parts of the fermi surface are mainly responsible for the superconductivity .",
    "since they have small fermi velocities , their influence in the transport response function which is proportional to @xmath12 is weak .",
    "such a scenario was recently proposed for borocarbides @xcite . * in the frame of the eliashberg theory it is impossible to elucidate the nature of the bosons which are responsible for the superconductivity . in this context",
    "i will use the term boson , keeping for short the standard electron - phonon notation @xmath0 . *",
    "i will restrict myself to the consideration of the local ( london ) limit case , that is , to the normal skin effect scenario .",
    "the generalisation of results obtained to the nonlocal ( pippard ) limit is possible but will not be considered here due to the lack of space . *",
    "the power of the proposed methods is illustrated analysing available experimental data for a single - domain yba@xmath4cu@xmath5o@xmath13 crystal @xcite .",
    "note , that to the best of my knowledge , the experimental htsc superconducting state reflectivity was not been considered from the inverse problem viewpoint at all , despite the single early attempt @xcite .",
    "* theoretical analysis of any physical quantity , as optical conductivity , is performed in frame of some model which includes a theoretical formalism and some assumptions about the band structure , the anisotropy of the coupling function and so on .",
    "the considered here isb model is the standard default . nevertheless , in frame of its _",
    "s-_wave version the question :  what is the value of the gap ? `` has an unique answer , but for _ d-_wave case the correct questions are either : ' ' what are the values of the gaps ? `` or ' ' what is the value of the maximum gap ?  .",
    "in other words , the absolute values and the physical meaning of the quantities are model dependent . *",
    "if the model is reach enough , one can calculate many physical properties using the same _ set of input ( material ) parameters_. a solution of the inverse problem means the determination of these material parameters from the experimental data .",
    "a short list of the isb model input parameters is given in section [ isbsub ] .",
    "* as a rule , the inverse problem is ill - posed .",
    "the experimental data contain less information , than we would like to know .",
    "the reasons for are the temperature induced broadening and the finite signal to noise ratio s / n . * in this lecture we will mainly be interested in the amount of the remaining information about the spectral function @xmath0 , which can be obtained from the optical data . in spectroscopy the unit of information is a peak .",
    "a single peak needs four parameters for its description : the upper and the low frequency bounds @xmath14 and @xmath15 , the position of the maximum and its amplitude .",
    "an narrow symmetric peak within the broad band needs three parameters : the amplitude , the halfwidth , and the position .",
    "the sum of all peaks yields the upper and lower frequency bounds @xmath14 and @xmath15 of the spectral band .",
    "since the @xmath15 of the @xmath0 is usually equal to zero , the remaining three band parameters of @xmath0 can be determined even from the normal state data @xcite .",
    "the standard isb model @xcite is the most developed part of the modern theory of superconductivity .",
    "it describes _ quantitatively _ the renormalization of the physical properties of metals due to the electron - boson interaction .",
    "the input quantities of the isb model are the density of states at the fermi energy @xmath16 , the fermi velocity @xmath17 , the impurity scattering rate @xmath18 , the coulomb pseudopotential @xmath19 , and the spectral function @xmath0 of the electron - boson interaction .",
    "the scale of transport and optical properties is fixed by the plasma frequency @xmath20 . in this section",
    "i present only the final expressions of the nam theory , more detailed information can be found in @xcite .    in order to calculate any physical property in the superconducting state one",
    "needs a solutions of eliashberg equations ( ee ) @xcite . in my opinion ,",
    "the following ee representation is most suitable for numerical solution by iterations @xmath21 \\mbox{re}\\frac{\\tilde{\\delta}(y)}{\\sqrt{\\tilde{\\omega}^2(y ) -\\tilde{\\delta}^2(y ) } }   \\label{eq1 } \\\\",

    "the real and the imaginary parts of the eliashberg functions @xmath22 and @xmath23 are connected by the kramers - kronig relations . hence , they have the same fourier images .",
    "this reasoning yields the fast solution procedure .",
    "the convolution type integrals ( [ eq1]-[imel ] ) should be calculated by the fast fourier transform ( fft ) algorithm .",
    "the inverse _ complex _ fourier transformations of the results obtained give _",
    "complex _ values of @xmath22 and @xmath23 . if one would like to use this efficient fft method also for _ d-_wave pairing symmetry , the process of arithmetic - geometric mean @xcite for the evaluation of the complex elliptic integrals ( see below eqs .",
    "( [ nscm1],[nscm2 ] ) is strongly recommended .",
    "the density of states re@xmath24 and the density of pairs re@xmath25 @xmath26 could be approximated by step functions .",
    "the convolution of any spectrum with the step function sign@xmath27 results in the shift by @xmath28 at @xmath29 and by @xmath30 at @xmath31 and its integration over y. it is important , that due to the presence of singularities in @xmath24 and @xmath25 at @xmath32 the more complicated functions such as @xmath33 and @xmath34 still contain a jump ( now at @xmath35 ) . since the convolution is a quite general property of the green functions approach , one can expect that the first derivatives from a spectrum ( of different nature ) over frequency will reproduce the input spectral function @xmath0 ( may be with the appropriate phase distortion ) . when applied to the optical conductivity",

    "\\i ) one has to perform the analytical continuation of the conductivity @xmath8 from the real energy axis , where we are living , to the poles of the bose distribution function ( matsubara boson energies ) @xmath50 .",
    "this procedure is similar to the kramers - kronig analysis , which is nothing other than the analytical continuation from the real frequency axis to itself .",
    "for example , if one fits the data by a sum of drude and lorentz terms or by formula ( [ padx ] ) , one has simply to substitute the complex values @xmath51 for the frequency .",
    "note , that the non - metallic ( ir active direct phonon contribution and interband transition ) part of the dielectric permeability @xmath52 have to be subtracted from the total one @xmath53 before starting of the analysis . in the genuine far infrared region",

    "if the signal to noise ratio is not extremely large , the last step makes no sense due to the dramatic increase of the uncertainty in the @xmath58 with elevation of n. the point is that the small quantities @xmath58 eq .  ( [ eslam2 ] ) and @xmath59 eq .  ( [ esom3 ] ) are the difference of large quantities .",
    "note , that the uncertainty in the @xmath58 values has to be small , not in comparison with @xmath58 itself , but with the difference between @xmath58 and its high energy asymptotic value @xmath60 where @xmath61 if the average boson energy has the order of @xmath62 , the last condition ( @xmath63 ) may be violated even for n=3 , since @xmath64 and @xmath58 have similar values .",
    "for example , at @xmath65100 k for the spectral function , shown by the dotted line in fig .",
    "[ josfig ] ,   @xmath66=1.37 , 1.12 , 1.06 , 1.03 for n=1 , 2 , 3 , 4 respectively . three or four @xmath58 values only form a too small parameter set to recover correctly the shape of the spectral function . actually , the possibility to obtain at least small amount of reliable information , is the additional advantage provided by the matsubara solution in comparison with the real axis one where _ all _ values are unreliable @xcite . fig .",
    "[ josfig ] shows the good agreement between the experimental normal state 1 - 2 - 3 single crystal reflectivity data @xcite and the calculated ones using for _ various _ spectral functions .",
    "unfortunately , the lack of a unique solution promoted unreasonable speculations on the mechanisms in several novel superconducting systems in connection with proposed hand - made electron - boson interaction functions . in my opinion , twelve years after the discovery of the superconductivity in cuprates it is timely to return to a self - consistent description of the superconductivity in this compounds .",

    "following this way , one can derive from ( [ sig1 ] ) the following formula @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the low - frequency value of the non - metallic ( phonon and interband transition ) part of dielectric permeability , and k@xmath74 is the electromagnetic kernel @xmath75    the first @xmath76 and the second @xmath77 allow ( for example ) to estimate the average boson energy and _ very approximately _ the width of the spectral function .",
    "if there is the possibility to combine this incomplete information about @xmath0 with the results of other spectral measurements , for example , tunnelling or neutron data , one can qualify the transport spectral function .",
    "the so called  model 2  electron - boson interaction function @xcite was recovered assuming , that the solution has to be resemble the phonon density of states , measured by inelasitc neutron spectroscopy .",

    "i choose the power law @xmath357 for the tail and the high energy cut - off 1600 @xmath7 .",
