    "the emergence of non - integrable behavior in quantum mechanics is a fascinating and widespread phenomenon which is largely responsible for the `` complexity '' intrinsic to the physical and mathematical description of interacting many - body quantum systems .",
    "a most striking consequence is the existence of distinctive _ quantum - chaotic _",
    "properties for dynamical systems which may lack a clear classical limit .",
    "the characterization of such quantum chaos signatures has a long history , pioneered by wigner in his effort to quantitatively model complex nuclei  @xcite , and eventually culminating in statistical approaches to complex quantum systems based on so - called _ random matrix theory _ ( rmt )",
    "@xcite .",
    "recent years have witnessed a renewed interest toward qualitatively reassessing and quantitatively exploring many - body quantum complexity and quantum chaos implications in the light of quantum information science ( qis ) @xcite .",
    "on one hand , a deeper understanding of quantum chaos and its implications is a prerequisite for identifying potentially harmful consequences as well as beneficial uses of chaos in information - processing devices : while the possibility that disorder may destabilize quantum computation through a `` chaotic melting '' @xcite calls for careful hardware design and error control , chaotic evolutions tend to naturally generate effectively _ random _ states which are a resource for a variety of qis protocols @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", qis provides additional tools for describing complexity of states and evolutions , which are proving useful in a variety of settings at the interface with condensed - matter and statistical physics .",
    "the notion of _ entanglement _ , in particular  as capturing distinctively quantum correlations which admit no local classical interpretation @xcite  plays a central role to this end . among the most notable developments to date",
    ", entanglement theory has allowed to considerably deepen the understanding of quantum critical phenomena ",
    "appropriate entanglement measures serving as an `` order parameter '' for detecting and classifying quantum phase transitions in matter @xcite  and to devise enhanced computational methods for both static and time - dependent properties of quantum lattice systems @xcite .    in this context , uncovering the relationship between various aspects of complexity in quantum states and evolutions , quantum chaos , and entanglement is both a natural and fundamental challenge , which is spurring significant activity in the field , see e.g. @xcite for representative contributions .",
    "in particular , specific questions to be answered include the following : what entanglement properties best capture the _ structural change _ occurring in typical many - body eigenstates across a transition to quantum chaos , and how well do such properties reflect the complexity of chaotic eigenstates ? to what extent does the amount of entanglement relate to the amount of underlying _ state delocalization _ ?",
    "perhaps most importantly , can entanglement theory suggest _ new signatures _ of quantum chaos ?    our goal in this work is to take a step toward answering some of the above questions , by seeking an in - depth characterization of entanglement properties of the _ stationary states _ ( eigenvectors ) of non - integrable as opposed to integrable many - body hamiltonians , in relation to the behavior of traditional complexity indicators related to rmt spectral statistics and delocalization measures . in this respect ,",

    "@xcite where , however , primary emphasis to _ pairwise _ and _ bipartite _ entanglement is given .",
    "only recently has genuine _ multipartite _ entanglement started to be addressed , notably in the one - dimensional ising model with a tilted magnetic field @xcite .    here , we focus on a representative class of _ disordered heisenberg models _ , which have received limited attention to date in spite of their prominent role in condensed - matter physics as well as in exchange - based circuit - model @xcite and cluster - state @xcite quantum computing architectures . as a further distinctive feature of our work , the notion of _ generalized entanglement _ ( ge ) , introduced by barnum _",
    "_ in @xcite , is exploited to both obtain a unified approach to standard ( qubit - based ) multipartite entanglement  quantified by a family of coarse - grained ( spin ) purity measures  and to construct ge measures directly probing correlations in different ( fermionic ) operator languages . from this point of view",

    "the content of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin in sec .",
    "ii by recalling the essential rmt background , along with well - established spectral signatures of quantum chaos and measures of pure - state delocalization .",
    "iii introduces the relevant class of one - dimensional ( 1d ) and two - dimensional ( 2d ) heisenberg models , laying out the static disorder settings under examination ( associated with randomness in the one - body energies , the two - body interactions , or both ) , and discussing the symmetries associated with different parameter regimes .",
    "a thorough characterization of integrability properties is obtained in sec .",
    "iv , with the twofold objective of distinguishing between delocalized - localized regions and chaotic - integrable ones .",
    "the implications of the dependence of delocalization upon the basis choice are elucidated , and a measure of _ relative delocalization _ is introduced to gain additional insight into the properties of eigenvectors in disorder - induced chaotic regimes . after a brief account on entanglement and ge measures in sec .",
    "v , we present in sec .  vi a detailed analysis of entanglement as a function of disorder strength , energy , as well as delocalization properties . as a main emerging feature , a strong and persistent correlation between multipartite entanglement and delocalization",
    "is found in _ non - integrable _ regimes , which is consistent with independent evidence in @xcite and _ may suggest a novel signature of quantum chaos_. while most results are numerical , analytical estimates for multipartite entanglement of _ random pure states localized to a subspace _ are also obtained and compared to rmt predictions . throughout the paper , special care",
    "is devoted to contrast properties which are general to disordered spin-@xmath0 lattices to those which are specific to the heisenberg interaction .",
    "the paper concludes with a summary and outlook in sec .",
    "vii , followed by an appendix which collects technical derivations .",
    "it is well established that quantized versions of classically integrable and fully chaotic systems can be distinguished by their quantum energy level statistics @xcite .",
    "of particular interest is the distribution of energy level spacings , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the spacing between neighboring energy levels after the spectrum has been appropriately unfolded , so that the density of states is everywhere equal to one .",
    "integrable systems typically exhibit a _ poisson distribution _ , @xmath3 whereas chaotic systems have an energy level spacing distribution predicted by rmt . within rmt ,",
    "an exact description of a complex physical system is replaced by a statistical description based on ensembles of random matrices which share the same fundamental symmetry properties as the original system hamiltonian . in particular , for the wide class of systems exhibiting time reversal invariance , the appropriate ensemble is the so - called gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) , whose energy level spacing distribution is closely approximated by the _ wigner - dyson distribution _ , @xmath4    the eigenvectors of fully chaotic systems may also be described statistically using rmt .",
    "if the system of interest obeys time - reversal symmetry , the eigenvector components tend to follow a gaussian distribution , resulting from the invariance of the goe under arbitrary orthogonal transformations @xcite .",
    "it is important to appreciate that systems such as interacting lattices of spin-@xmath0 particles have no obvious classical limit , thus the question of whether or not they may exhibit chaos must be posed and answered from an entirely quantum - mechanical perspective . because the standard defining features of classical chaos ( phase - space ergodicity and exponential divergence of neighboring trajectories ) have no direct meaning for hamiltonian quantum dynamical systems , neither does an unambiguously established framework exist for consistently defining integrability in quantum settings @xcite , such an issue is not straightforward and still largely open . in the present context , we shall use the term `` quantum chaos '' in an operational sense , to simply mean the presence of rmt energy level statistics .    in order to examine the transition from integrability to chaos ,",
    "the following picture is employed @xcite .",
    "let @xmath5 be an integrable hamiltonian , that is , one for which the eigenvalues and eigenvectors may be determined analytically @xcite .",
    "now consider the effect of an integrability - breaking perturbation , @xmath6 , so that the total hamiltonian becomes @xmath7    for sufficiently small values of the parameter @xmath8 , the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath9 are adequately described by perturbation theory . as @xmath8 increases to the point where the interaction strength between states which are directly coupled by @xmath6 is equal to their unperturbed energy difference  @xcite , perturbation theory breaks down , and a crossover from a poisson to a wigner - dyson distribution occurs . in parallel with such a crossover in energy level statistics ,",
    "the eigenvectors of @xmath9 become increasingly _",
    "delocalized _ across the eigenstates of @xmath5 .",
    "as @xmath8 increases further , delocalization typically continues until the component distribution of the eigenvectors becomes that of goe random states .",
    "the exact relationship between the level statistics and delocalization border has been much studied and remains in general an open question  @xcite .    in order to identify",
    "parameter ranges where chaos is present , it is necessary to quantify how accurately the statistical properties of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the hamiltonian are described by rmt . here , we will address this question by examining the energy level and eigenvector statistics across the _ full _ spectrum , rather than restricting to a specific spectral region ( see also sec .",
    "iv.c for additional quantitative discussion of this point ) .    the extent to which the energy level spacing distribution distribution interpolates between the poisson and wigner - dyson limits may be conveniently parametrized by a so - called _ level statistics indicator _ ( @xmath10 ) , introduced in @xcite : @xmath11ds}{\\int_0^{s_o}[p_{\\tt p}(s)-p_{\\tt wd}(s)]ds } \\label{lsi},\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the first intersection point of @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath10 has the value @xmath15 when @xmath16 , whereas @xmath17 if @xmath18 .    in order to characterize the degree of eigenvector delocalization ,",
    "a convenient measure is the so - called _ number of principal components _ ( @xmath19 ) @xcite .",
    "given a basis @xmath20 of the system hilbert space @xmath21 , @xmath19 of a normalized pure - state vector @xmath22 , is defined as follows : @xmath23}^{-1}\\label{npc}.\\ ] ]    thus , @xmath19 estimates the number of basis states relative to which @xmath22 has a significant component .",
    "for example , if @xmath22 is a uniform superposition of exactly @xmath24 basis states , then @xmath25 .",
    "for an @xmath26-dimensional state vector with a component distribution pertaining to the goe , the expected @xmath19 is given by @xmath27 where the factor @xmath28 emerges from the gaussian fluctuations of the eigenstates , and the additive correction @xmath29 is due to normalization  @xcite .",
    "since @xmath26 is usually large , the approximation @xmath30 is commonly adopted . in parallel with the fact that the @xmath10 as constructed takes into account the level statistics across the full spectrum , we will be primarily interested in the average value of @xmath19 across all of the eigenvectors in a relevant subspace .",
    "the heisenberg model in one- and two - spatial dimensions plays a paradigmatic role in condensed matter physics and statistical mechanics as a testbed for exploring quantum magnetism and spin dynamics in reduced dimensionality  @xcite .",
    "thus , an accurate characterization of its integrability properties in physical regimes of interest has both a fundamental and practical significance . in the special case of spin-@xmath0 particles ,",
    "a partial characterization of the integrability - to - chaos transition has been achieved , based on both _ clean _",
    "systems where chaos is induced by coupling two different spin chains @xcite or by adding next - nearest - neighbor interactions @xcite , as well as _ disordered _ systems , where the integrability - breaking term consists of random magnetic fields applied to all or a subset of spins @xcite . aside from their relevance to model real materials , disordered systems offer the added advantage of providing a natural arena to study the interplay between interaction and disorder , which remains a most challenging problem in condensed - matter physics .    within qis , the _ isotropic _ heisenberg spin-@xmath0 model in an external magnetic field arises naturally in some of the most promising solid - state proposals for scalable quantum computation , each spin corresponding , in the simplest settings , to a logical qubit and the exchange interaction providing the required inter - qubit coupling . following the original suggestion by loss and divincenzo  @xcite for coupling electron - spin qubits via _ tunable _ heisenberg interactions in semiconductor quantum dots , schemes for effecting exchange - based universal quantum computation",
    "have been further developed for both electron  @xcite and donor - atom nuclear spins  @xcite , constructive methods for universal quantum gate design and efficient readout being identified in  @xcite . in addition , scalable universal architectures where _ always - on _ heisenberg couplings are used in conjunction with appropriate encodings of a logical qubits into three or more physical spins have been constructed , offering both substantial implementation flexibility  @xcite and enhanced decoherence suppression  @xcite .",
    "depending on implementation detail , imperfect qubit fabrication and/or uncontrolled residual spin - spin couplings during storage or gating may introduce an integrability breaking perturbation @xmath6 , causing the prerequisite mapping to well - defined logical qubits to be lost .",
    "while a number of error control schemes exist in principle to counteract the effects of @xmath6 ( notably , dynamical refocusing methods for static disorder as considered here , see e.g.  @xcite ) , understanding the error behavior due to @xmath6 remains an important preliminary step .",
    "the hamiltonian for an @xmath31-site lattice of spin-@xmath0 particles coupled by the heisenberg interaction and subject to a bias field in the @xmath32 direction is given by : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the vector of pauli matrices @xmath35 acting on the two - dimensional hilbert space of the @xmath36-th site .",
    "the parameter @xmath37 determines the on - site zeeman energy of the @xmath36-th spin , and will be parameterized as @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is a non - zero average and @xmath40 are uniformly distributed within @xmath41 $ ] , characterizing the different strengths of local random magnetic fields .",
    "the interaction strength between spin @xmath36 and @xmath42 is given by @xmath43 , which will be likewise parameterized as @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the average coupling , and @xmath46 represents random interactions , being uniformly distributed in @xmath47 $ ]  @xcite .",
    "since we are interested in the whole spectrum , the sign of the exchange coupling parameter @xmath45 is irrelevant . in the numerical simulations",
    ", we shall assume @xmath48 .",
    "the set of interacting pairs @xmath49 is determined by the topology of the lattice .",
    "we shall consider nearest neighbor interactions on a 1d chain and on a 2d rectangular lattice .",
    "in addition , the following notation is introduced : @xmath50    as discussed in sec .",
    "iv , these two terms correspond to integrable limits of the hamiltonian given in eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) .",
    "it is important to appreciate that the class of systems considered here ( eq .  ( [ ham ] ) ) is more accurately described by the so - called _ two - body random ensemble _ ( tbre ) , which , instead of @xmath31-body couplings as implicit in the goe , involves only two - body interactions .",
    "the tbre , and more broadly the embedded gaussian ensembles with @xmath51-body interactions ( @xmath52 ) , was introduced in @xcite as a physically more realistic statistical setting for describing few - body interacting systems , such as atoms , molecules , and nuclei . among the differences between the two ensembles",
    "@xcite , we highlight the ones which are most directly relevant to this work :    * the goe local density of states ( also called the ldos profile , see e.g. @xcite ) as a function of energy shows a semicircular law , whereas it is gaussian for the tbre .",
    "* the tbre lacks ergodicity , in the sense that the statistical properties of each ensemble member need _ not _ coincide with the ensemble average  @xcite . * contrary to the energy - independent @xmath19 value predicted by the goe , the @xmath19 estimate for the tbre shows a strong variation with the energy of the state , approaching the goe prediction of @xmath53 mostly in the middle of the energy spectrum .",
    "although integrability may be regarded as equivalent to the presence of a _ complete set of symmetries _ of the defining hamiltonian @xcite , if such a set is incomplete then chaos may still be present within distinct symmetry sectors .",
    "however , a wigner - dyson distribution occurring independently in different sectors will tend to be washed out if the corresponding energy levels are mixed together .",
    "thus , in order for clear conclusions to be drawn based on the energy level statistics , it is necessary to de - symmetrize the spectrum according to its trivial symmetries , that is , the level spacing distribution must be examined separately in each resulting symmetry sector .",
    "the symmetries of the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) are determined by the choice of model parameters @xmath37 and @xmath43 :    1 .",
    "_ rotational symmetry around the @xmath32-axis .",

    "we shall focus primarily on this subspace , @xmath58 , as chaos sets in here first .",
    "a natural basis for @xmath58 is the one associated with the eigenstates of @xmath59 , which will be referred to as the _ computational basis _ or simply c - basis .",
    "conservation of total spin .",
    "_ when the on - site energies are degenerate , @xmath60 , the total spin , @xmath61 , also becomes a good quantum number , @xmath62=0 $ ] .",
    "therefore , in this parameter regime the system must be separately studied in each symmetry sector characterized by fixed quantum numbers @xmath63 and @xmath64  @xcite .",
    "symmetries due to lattice geometry . _ for @xmath65 and @xmath66 , symmetries under site permutations related to the geometry of the lattice must also be considered . under periodic boundary conditions",
    ", @xmath9 is invariant under cyclic translations and reflections of the lattice sites , resulting in momentum and parity conservation respectively .",
    "note that in rectangular 2d lattices , momentum and parity in both directions are good quantum numbers . for open boundary conditions ,",
    "the hamiltonian is invariant under lattice reflections only .",
    "we shall restrict our analysis to _ open boundary conditions _ in what follows , because they lead to fewer symmetries hence larger invariant subspaces , which permit better eigenvalue statistics .",
    "therefore , when identifying invariant subspaces , the eigenstates will be grouped according to their quantum numbers @xmath67 , where @xmath68 indicates parity .",
    "4 .   _ time - reversal invariance . _",
    "goe is the ensemble appropriate for describing the static properties of systems exhibiting time - reversal invariance , that is , for hamiltonians that commute with the time - reversal operator , @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the conjugation operator in the c - basis for spin-@xmath0 .",
    "it is important to note that the heisenberg model with a magnetic field does _ not _ commute with the conventional time reversal operator , @xmath71 .",
    "nevertheless , the goe rather that the more general gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) is appropriate for this model because the hamiltonian matrix admits a straightforward _ real _ representation in the c - basis .",
    "equivalently , one may understand the applicability of the goe as resulting from the fact that the hamiltonian commutes with @xmath70 which may be regarded a non - standard time - reversal operator as in  @xcite .",
    "although , as mentioned , for a fully established ( or weakly broken ) symmetry one may examine the level statistics in each invariant subspace , for strongly broken symmetry it is no longer possible to sort eigenvalues by symmetry quantum numbers nor can correlations between different subspaces be ignored . as a result , separating the effect of symmetries on the energy level spacing distribution from that of integrability vs. chaoticity becomes challenging throughout the symmetry transition regime , that is , it is difficult to distinguish systematically between the emergence of a complete vs. incomplete set of symmetries . while some analytical results exist for eigenvalue statistics across the full space in the presence of symmetry - breaking @xcite , they do not offer a practical diagnostic tool for distinguishing between fully chaotic and partly integrable behavior in broken - symmetry regimes based on lsi ( especially when multiple symmetry subspaces are involved as in the @xmath72-symmetry breaking which plays a relevant role here ) .",
    "the heisenberg model may be regarded as one of a related class of spin-1/2 lattice models with two - body interaction hamiltonians of the form : @xmath73 .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in particular , the 2d ising model in a transverse field @xmath74 , as well as the xxz model ( @xmath75 and the isotropic xy model @xmath76 , have been previously studied in the context of quantum computation and quantum chaos @xcite .",
    "however , the heisenberg model differs in some essential characteristics , notably the nontrivial role of symmetries .",
    "also distinctive of the heisenberg exchange coupling is the competing nature of the two interacting terms in the hamiltonian : in the c - basis , the diagonal ising interaction @xmath77 favors localization , whereas the flip - flop term @xmath78 induces delocalization .",
    "thus , a comparison between our results and those of previous studies shall also serve to identify those properties which are generic to disordered spin-@xmath0 lattices as contrasted to those specific to the heisenberg model .",
    "we shall proceed by first obtaining a basic characterization of the level spacing distribution and average delocalization properties of the eigenvectors for a wide range of parameters of interest , and then proceed to examining entanglement properties in sec .",
    "vi .      the model described by eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) shows two limiting integrable cases , @xmath59 and @xmath79 [ eqs .",
    "( [ hz ] ) and ( [ hj ] ) , respectively ] .",
    "the first is a trivially solvable non - interacting problem , while the second is solvable only in 1d by bethe ansatz  @xcite . a transition to chaos",
    "may be induced by adding an integrability - breaking term to any of the two integrable limits . here",
    ", we shall focus on the following representative scenarios :    _ case _ : :    exchange interactions with a constant strength @xmath45 are    added to @xmath80 .",
    "the crossover between integrability    and chaos is studied as a function of the ratio    @xmath81 , with @xmath82    throughout .",
    "_ case _ : :    exchange interactions with random strength are added to    @xmath83 . the crossover between integrability and chaos    is analyzed as a function of the ratio @xmath84 , with    @xmath85 throughout . _ case _ : :    exchange interactions with random strength are added to    @xmath80 . the crossover between integrability and chaos    is studied as a function of the ration    @xmath86 .",
    "clearly , * _ case _ * includes the other two cases in limiting situations : specifically , it coincides with * _ case _ * when the on - site disorder dominates over the disorder in the coupling strengths , @xmath87 , and with * _ case _ * when the distribution of coupling strengths is very narrow , @xmath88 .",
    "because the properties of a state vector ( in particular , delocalization ) depend entirely on the choice of representation , quantities such as @xmath19 can not serve as intrinsic ( basis - independent ) indicators of quantum chaos , such as energy level statistics are considered to be .",
    "this fact may undermine the entire program of establishing connections between the properties of the eigenvectors of a hamiltonian and its level of chaoticity .",
    "yet , it is well - known that for chaotic hamiltonians , rmt predictions hold ( to some extent ) in a large number of reasonable representations , although a systematic characterization of such representations and the degree of agreement one may expect remain at present an unanswered question . here",
    ", we conform to the standard approach to this problem , and examine eigenvector properties with respect to a basis in which the spread of the eigenvectors has a physical meaning , for instance one which relates to the relevant measurement capabilities , or to an integrable limit of the class of hamiltonians under consideration . on one hand",
    ", we shall investigate to what extent the eigenvector properties associated with quantum chaos depend on the choice of two different bases corresponding to the integrable limits ( [ hz])-([hj ] ) . on the other hand",
    ", we shall introduce a measure of relative delocalization between bases associated with different disorder realizations .",
    "specifically , we will examine :    \\(i ) the above - mentioned _ c - basis _ , which is associated with the eigenstates of @xmath59 . in quantum computation",
    ", this is the basis that represents classical information , relative to which the final read - out measurement is performed @xcite .",
    "the associated @xmath19 will be labeled @xmath89 .",
    "\\(ii ) a so - called _ j - basis _ , or interaction basis , which corresponds to the eigenbasis of @xmath79 . in this case , the associated @xmath19 will be denoted by @xmath90 .",
    "\\(iii ) a disorder - dependent relative representation , which is obtained as follows . within a set of sequentially generated random realizations , the eigenbasis of a given random realization is used to calculate @xmath19 for the eigenvectors of the subsequent realization .",
    "the associated @xmath19 , which will be denoted @xmath91 , quantifies _ relative delocalization _",
    ", that is how delocalized are the eigenbases associated with different disorder realizations with respect to each other , rather than with respect to some fixed basis . by construction",
    ", this quantity is independent of any fixed basis and depends only on the disorder .",
    "interestingly , an approach which attempts to quantify the `` complexity '' of the eigenstates of an ensemble of hamiltonians in a way similar to the above - mentioned relative delocalization has been proposed based on the notion of _ correlational entropy _ @xcite .",
    "both correlational entropy and relative delocalization overcome the problem of basis dependence by invoking a distribution over hamiltonians .",
    "an important difference , however , is that evaluating the correlational entropy requires tracking individual eigenstates as a function of the disorder across the full disorder space .",
    "while a further comparison between the two concepts would be worth pursuing , it is likely that this feature could make relative delocalization computationally more tractable for many disorder settings .",
    "we consider the @xmath92-subspace , @xmath93 , for 1d and 2d models . in both cases , for lattice size @xmath94 ,",
    "dim@xmath95 . as anticipated in sec .",
    "ii , @xmath19 values are averaged over all eigenstates in @xmath58 , and both @xmath10 and @xmath19 are further averaged over a number of disorder realizations sufficient for accurate statistics , as indicated in each figure caption .    *",
    "_ case . _ * for this disorder setting , two integrability - chaos transitions are verified for the 1d model , whereas only one occurs in 2d . from the top panels of fig .",
    "[ case1 ] , we see that in both cases the first crossover , from the @xmath59 integrable limit to chaos , is observed as the interaction strength @xmath45 increases from zero to a value close to the energy difference between directly coupled states , @xmath96 . in the other extreme , where @xmath97 and therefore @xmath98 , the transition to @xmath72- and @xmath68-symmetry complicates the interpretation of the energy level statistics . during this transition ,",
    "different @xmath99 invariant subspaces partially overlap , and the observed @xmath10 increase across the whole @xmath56-subspace need not reflect a change towards integrability , but rather the progressive decoupling of states belonging to different subspaces ( this region is indicated by a dashed line in the figure ) .",
    "once the transition is complete , at @xmath100 , the level spacing distribution within individual @xmath67 symmetry sectors may be determined .",
    "this results in a poisson distribution for the 1d model @xcite , consistent with its exact solvability .",
    "however , and contrary to the behavior of the @xmath10 across the whole @xmath58 , the level spacing distribution in the invariant subspaces of the 2d system are strongly wigner - dyson .",

    "[ case1 ] .",
    "corresponding to the broader chaotic region detected by the @xmath10 , there is greater delocalization in 2d , especially as quantified by @xmath90 and @xmath91 . for both cases ,",
    "the maximum @xmath19 in most instances occurs within the chaotic region , which we take to be @xmath105 @xcite .",
    "however , the actual value falls short of the rmt prediction and different @xmath19 measures may disagree substantially even within the chaotic region .",

    "note that the behavior of @xmath91 matches more closely the behavior of @xmath10 on the low @xmath107-@xmath108 transition than @xmath89 .",
    "however , in the limit @xmath109 @xmath91 fails to discriminate between the integrability of the 1d model and the presence of chaos in the 2d model , decreasing to 1 in both cases due to the absence of disorder .    *",

    "[ case3 ] to increase irrespective of the chaoticity or integrability of the hamiltonian .",
    "as previously discussed , in this limit the 1d model is integrable , while the 2d model is not .",

    "disorder in the system has been introduced through random applied magnetic fields , random interactions , or both .",
    "our main findings and conclusions may be summarized as follows .",
    "\\(i ) although correspondence with non - integrability is well documented , the interpretation of lsi data is , as expected , non - trivial in symmetry transition regions where invariant subspaces are partially overlapping  causing a tendency towards the poisson distribution regardless of whether integrability is approached or not .",
    "\\(ii ) standard npc measures for state delocalization depend entirely on which basis is chosen to represent the eigenvectors of the hamiltonian , thus they need not detect the transition from integrability to chaos if the latter is not accompanied by a significant change in the amount of delocalization . we have examined the effect of basis choice in two distinct bases of limiting integrable hamiltonians as well as introduced a measure of relative , disorder - dependent delocalization which is shown to successfully detect quantum chaos in the presence of disorder .",
    "we find that delocalization , particularly in the computational basis , does not achieve the level predicted by rmt even in chaotic regions for the heisenberg model . low connectivity and the localizing nature of the ising pairing",
    "are likely to play a role in accounting for such disagreement .",
    "\\(iii ) in delocalized systems , npc and multipartite qubit entanglement show a dependence on energy that resembles the one observed for the density of states in the tbre , reflecting a strong correlation among the three quantities .",
    "this complements findings on the influence of ldos properties to dynamical aspects of entanglement in disordered qubit systems @xcite .",
    "\\(iv ) in the case where only random heisenberg interactions are present , an interesting connection between level statistics , average eigenvector entanglement and delocalization , and the presence of a random singlet phase was uncovered in 1d .",
    "this may warrant further study , also in view of better elucidating what mutual relationships ( if any ) exist between quantum criticality and the ability of a system to sustain quantum chaos .",
    "\\(v ) delocalization and multipartite entanglement both show a substantial increase during the transition from a localized integrable hamiltonian to a chaotic one .",
    "similar to npc measures , both entanglement and ge measures are unavoidably relative to a choice of `` local '' resources  as captured by preferred subsystems or observables .",
    "however , comparison between two quantities sharing the _ same relative origin _  npc and @xmath175  results in a distinctive relationship which may serve as a quantum chaos indicator .",
    "physically , such a relationship suggests that both entanglement and delocalization in a given local basis essentially capture the same information about eigenvector structure .",
    "both the validity and implications of this potential entanglement signature , as well as a more substantial use of genuine ge , are points deserving additional in - depth investigation .",
    "in particular , a promising venue to explore is the possibility that ge measures relative to appropriate observable sets may allow to detect a transition to chaos starting from _ any _ integrable model , irrespective of its local or non - local nature with respect the the original operator language .",
    "finally , from a technical standpoint , the general method suggested in @xcite and explicitly illustrated here for computing typical entanglement properties of random pure states localized to a proper subspace of states in hilbert space is likely to find broader applications within both quantum chaos and qis .",
    "given the general expression of relative purity in eq .",
    "( [ hpur ] ) , each @xmath175 may be expressed as a sum of squared expectation values over a normalized , orthonormal traceless basis @xmath165 for the distinguished observable set @xmath164 .",
    "that is , @xmath218 where @xmath167 is a normalization factor ensuring that max@xmath219 .",
    "thus , the average purity over any ensemble of states is given by latexmath:[\\[\\overline{p_n } ( { |{\\psi}\\rangle } ) = \\kappa \\sum_i \\overline{\\langle \\psi      _ let @xmath21 be a finite - dimensional hilbert space , with dimension @xmath26 , and let @xmath159 be any traceless real symmetric operator on @xmath221 , normalized such that @xmath222 . then for an ensemble of pure states @xmath146 with real components taken uniformly with respect to the haar measure on @xmath223 , the following relationship holds : @xmath224 _    for random states limited to a proper subspace , @xmath225 , additional care must be taken because @xmath159 need not be normalized or traceless after projection onto @xmath226 .",
    "let @xmath227=dim(@xmath228 ) and let @xmath229 denote the projector onto @xmath226 . if we let @xmath230 , where @xmath231 and @xmath232 , it follows that @xmath233 the coefficients @xmath234 and @xmath235 may be determined from @xmath236 and @xmath237 , @xmath238 respectively . therefore , in order to calculate @xmath180 , the trace norm of both the projection @xmath239 , and the projection squared ,",
    "@xmath240 , of each basis operator onto @xmath226 must be determined .",
    "since in our case each @xmath175 is an average over the purities of @xmath241 @xmath174-qubit subsystems , it suffices to determine the average subsystem purity of a single @xmath174-qubit subsystem . a convenient operator basis is provided by the set of @xmath174-qubit pauli operators , that is , all products of single - qubit pauli operators and the identity , @xmath242 , where @xmath243 , or @xmath32 .",
    "the choice of the identity , @xmath244 , acting simultaneously on all qubits is excluded .",
    "it will be useful to consider the representation of the pauli operators as matrices expressed in the standard c - basis .",
    "the subspace @xmath245 of states with total @xmath92 angular momentum ( no net magnetization ) is relevant to our study , @xmath246 .",
    "the pauli operators that have a non - vanishing projection into @xmath247 are :        first , consider case ( 1 ) .",
    "each such operator is diagonal in the c - basis , hence it remains diagonal after projection into @xmath58 .",
    "because the eigenvalues of each such operator are @xmath251 , @xmath252 may be determined by simply counting the number of c - basis states spanning @xmath247 that correspond with each eigenvalue . for a pauli string consisting of @xmath24 @xmath248 and @xmath253 @xmath244 operators ,",
    "the number of c - basis states with @xmath51 1 s for the qubits acted on by the @xmath248 operators is @xmath254 @xmath255 .",
    "thus , @xmath256 if @xmath24 is odd , then the above quantity is @xmath155 .",
    "next , consider case ( 2 ) .",
    "note that the effect of the operator @xmath257 or @xmath258 acting on a c - basis state is to flip the ith qubit from 0 to 1 , or 1 to 0 .",
    "thus , for a c - basis state to remain in @xmath247 after the action of a pauli operator , the combined number of @xmath249 and @xmath250 operators must be even .",
    "additionally , since every state in the ensemble has only real components in the c - basis , those pauli operators that have an odd number of @xmath250 have zero expectation value for each state in the ensemble . for a pauli string with a total of @xmath24 @xmath249 and @xmath250 operators , @xmath24 0 s and",
    "1 s will be flipped when the operator acts on a c - basis state .",
    "thus , the qubits acted on must have an equal number of 1 s as 0 s in order to remain in @xmath259 .",
    "there are @xmath260 possible assignments of 0 s and 1 s for such qubits .",
    "the remaining qubits ( that is , those not acted upon by @xmath249 or @xmath250 operators ) must also have an equal number of 1 s as 0 s since the state is in @xmath259 .",
    "there are @xmath261 possible assignments for such qubits .",
    "therefore , there are @xmath262 @xmath263 matrix elements in such a pauli operator .",
    "since each matrix element is 1 , it follows that @xmath264 since @xmath265 acts non - trivially on every c - basis state , there are no diagonal elements hence @xmath266 .    in order to properly normalize purity on an @xmath174-qubit subsystem ,",
    "consider the pure c - basis state @xmath267 .",
    "only pauli operators consisting of @xmath248 and @xmath244 operators have non - vanishing expectation values for this state , and each such expectation value is 1 .",
