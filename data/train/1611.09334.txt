    "and @xmath6 here label the quasiparticle types . ]     and @xmath7 symbols . ]",
    "the walker - wang models are a class of exactly solvable models for 3d topological orders .",
    "the basic intuition behind the walker - wang construction is simple . given a 2d anyon theory , the model is constructed such that the ground state wave function is a superposition of `` 3d string - nets '' labeled by the anyon types , which describe the 2 + 1d space time trajectories of the anyons ( fig . [ wf ] ) .",
    "the coefficient in front of each configuration is equal to the topological amplitude of the corresponding anyon process .",
    "it can be evaluated by using the graphical rules depicting the algebraic data of the anyon theory , captured essentially by the @xmath8 and @xmath7 symbols defined in fig .",
    "[ fr ] , which specify the fusion and braiding rules of the anyons , respectively .",
    "the bulk - boundary correspondence described above is similar in spirit to the correspondence between quantum hall wave functions and the edge conformal field theories .",
    "there the systems are in one dimension lower , and the bulk wave function is expressed as a correlator in the boundary cft .    mathematically , the input anyon theory of a walker - wang model is described by a braided fusion category @xmath9 .",
    "if @xmath9 is modular , which means that the only quasiparticle that braids trivially with itself and all other quasiparticles in @xmath9 is the vacuum , the output theory would have a trivial bulk and a surface with topological order described by @xmath9 , and the model belongs to the first type of walker - wang models we introduced in the previous section . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath9 is non - modular , the output theory would have a nontrivial bulk , and the model belongs to the second type of walker - wang models .",
    "the surface theory in this case is more complicated because it contains not only the quasiparticles in @xmath9 , but also the endpoints of bulk loop excitations that are cut open by the system boundary .    to be more concrete ,",
    "let us illustrate with two examples .",
    "first , we consider the simplest nontrivial input @xmath9 possible , which consists of only the vacuum @xmath10 and a boson @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath9 is non - modular because @xmath11 is distinct from the vacuum but braids trivially with everything in @xmath9 .",
    "a walker - wang model with such input describes the 3d @xmath12 gauge theory with @xmath11 being the @xmath12 gauge charge , which is deconfined in the bulk and on the boundary.@xcite next , we modify @xmath9 a bit by replacing the boson @xmath11 with a semion @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath9 becomes modular in this case , because @xmath13 braids nontrivially with itself . a walker - wang model with the modified input",
    "has a trivial bulk and a deconfined semion excitation @xmath13 on the boundary.@xcite    in general , deconfined bulk quasiparticle excitations of a walker - wang model correspond to quasiparticles in the symmetric center @xmath14 of the input braided fusion category @xmath9 .",
    "a quasiparticle belongs to @xmath14 if it has trivial braiding with itself and all other quasiparticles in @xmath9 .",
    "if @xmath9 is modular , @xmath14 is trivial , which is consistent with the fact that a walker - wang model with modular input has a trivial bulk . if @xmath9 is non - modular , it is known that there are two possibilities for @xmath14@xcite : ( 1 ) @xmath14 contains only bosons . in this case , it can be identified with the set of irreducible representations of some finite group @xmath15 ; ( 2 ) @xmath14 contains at least one fermion . in this case , it can also be identified with the set of irreducible representations of some finite group @xmath15 , but each representation comes with a parity , and the set is split into even and odd sectors , corresponding to the bosons and fermions in @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "thus , the deconfined bulk quasiparticle excitations of a walker - wang model with non - modular input correspond to the irreducible representations of some finite group , and it is plausible that the bulk topological order of the model is a gauge theory of the corresponding group .    before delving into the exploration of the above possibility , let us review some details of walker - wang models .",
    "we closely follow ref . and refer the reader there for further details .",
    "walker - wang models are defined on a fixed planar projection of a trivalent resolution of the cublic lattice as shown in fig .",
    "[ lattice ] .",
    "the hilbert space of a model defined on the lattice is spanned by all labelings of the edges by the input anyon types .",
    "the hamiltonian is of the form @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a vertex term which enforces the fusion rules at @xmath18 by giving an energy penalty to string configurations that violate the fusion rules at @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is a plaquette term of the form @xmath20 , where the summation is over all the input anyon types @xmath13 , weighted by the quantum dimension of @xmath13 .",
    "each @xmath21 acts on the anyon labels of the edges around plaquette @xmath22 , in a way determined by the anyon labels of the edges adjoining @xmath22 .",
    "more explicitly , the matrix element of @xmath21 sandwiched between states with plaquette edges @xmath23 and @xmath24 is given by @xmath25 the above expression looks rather complicated , but there is a simple graphical way of understanding the action of @xmath21 .",
    "namely , @xmath21 temporarily displaces certain links ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 in fig .",
    "[ plaquette ] ) and fuses a loop with anyon label @xmath13 to the skeleton of @xmath22 .",
    "one can check that all terms in the hamiltonian commute , and the model is exactly solvable .    to be able to discuss point and loop excitations in walker - wang models",
    ", we also need to define string operators and membrane operators in these models .",
    "the string operators have a graphical definition analogous to that of the plaquette operators .",
    "namely , to create a pair of quasiparticle excitations @xmath28 at two points , we just need to lay an @xmath5-string connecting the two points , and then fuse it to the edges of the lattice .",
    "furthermore , one can show that the string operator commutes ( resp .",
    "fails to commute ) with the plaquette operators threaded by the string if @xmath29 ( resp .",
    "@xmath30 ) , and the corresponding quasiparticles are deconfined ( resp .",
    "confined ) in the bulk . on the other hand , all quasiparticles in @xmath9",
    "are deconfined on the boundary , because string operators restricted to the boundary do not thread any plaquettes and hence there is no energy penalty associated with them . unlike the string operators , in general",
    ", we do not know how to implement membrane operators in walker - wang models , but as we will show below , we can deduce the statistics of the loop excitations without explicitly writing down the membrane operators .",
    "in this section , we discuss how the 3d @xmath0 gauge theories can be described by walker - wang models .",
    "in particular , we ask the question : how do we find the input data of the walker - wang models that will generate the twisted gauge theories ?",
    "our insight into solving this problem comes from the study of 3d @xmath0 symmetry protected topological ( spt ) phases , which are a class of gapped short - range entangled phases of matter protected by a global symmetry .",
    "a nontrivial spt phase has the interesting property that its surface state is anomalous,@xcite meaning that it can not exist on its own and must be realized as the boundary of some system in one dimension higher .",
    "this implies that a gapped symmetric surface of a nontrivial spt phase must have nontrivial topological order , and that the symmetry must fractionalize on the anyons in an anomalous way . specifically to the @xmath0 spts , we will first review a particular kind of gapped symmetric surface states of these spts , called the projected semion states .",
    "we will introduce its anyon content , and the symmetry fractionalization pattern of @xmath0 on the anyons .",
    "next , we couple the systems to a @xmath0 gauge field , and study the surface theories of the gauged systems .",
    "finally , it is known that upon gauging , a trivial ( resp .",
    "nontrivial ) spt becomes an untwisted ( resp .",
    "twisted ) gauge theory,@xcite which leads us to propose a walker - wang model description of the @xmath0 gauge theories based on the surface anyon content of the gauged @xmath0 spts .",
    "the projective semion states are 2d symmetry fractionalization patterns with a semion and a @xmath0 symmetry , first introduced and analyzed in ref . and ref .",
    "they may be considered as variants of the kalmeyer - laughlin chiral spin liquid ( csl)@xcite .",
    "we first give a brief review of the kalmeyer - laughlin csl .",
    "the topological order of the theory is the same as that of the @xmath31 bosonic fractional quantum hall state .",
    "the only nontrivial quasiparticle is a semion , which has topological spin @xmath32 and fuses into the vacuum with another semion .",
    "moreover , the semion carries a spin-1/2 , transforming projectively under the @xmath33 symmetry .",
    "the csl can thus be understood as a symmetry fractionalization pattern of @xmath33 on a semion .",
    "the theory is non - anomalous , because it can be realized in a purely 2d system with the explicit construction in ref . .",
    "to describe the projective semion states , we reduce the @xmath33 symmetry to a @xmath0 subgroup , consisting of rotations along the @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 axes by @xmath37 degrees , which we denote by @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , respectively . by restricting the spin-1/2 representation of @xmath33 to this reduced symmetry group , we obtain a projective representation of @xmath0 : @xmath41 the csl is therefore a symmetry fractionalization pattern of @xmath0 on a semion where the semion carries a half charge under all nontrivial group elements , because acting a nontrivial group element twice on a spin-1/2 is equivalent to rotating the spin-1/2 by 360 degrees along the corresponding axis , which results in a phase factor of @xmath42 .    however , the csl is not the only possible symmetry fractionalization pattern of @xmath0 on a semion .",
    "the semion can also transform under other projective representations of @xmath0 . more specifically",
    ", the semion can carry either integral or half - integral charges under the nontrivial elements of @xmath0 , and we have 3 variants of the csl , called the `` anomalous projective semion '' ( aps ) states , where the symmetry action on the semion can be represented as @xmath43    if we take @xmath38 and @xmath39 to be the two generators of @xmath0 , the aps - x , aps - y , and aps - z theories correspond to the cases where the semion carries a half charge under either the first , second , or both generators , respectively . it was argued in ref .",
    "and ref . that the addition of such half charges to the csl , though compatible with the fusion rules of the semion , leads to anomalies in the theory .",
    "this can be seen via the violation of the pentagon equations for the symmetry defects@xcite or the failure in promoting the global symmetry to a gauge symmetry @xcite in the effective field theory ( dubbed the t hooft anomaly@xcite ) .",
    "the anomalous projective semion theories are therefore not realizable in purely 2d systems .",
    "nevertheless , they can be realized on the boundary of some nontrivial 3d @xmath0 spt phases .",
    "exactly solvable models for such 3d spt phases based on the `` decorated '' walker - wang models were constructed in ref . .",
    "more specifically , the semion walker - wang model studied in ref . is decorated with unitary linear representations of @xmath0 , such that the ground state wave function is a loop gas of semion lines dressed with @xmath0 haldane chains .",
    "the endpoints of open semion lines , which are deconfined semion excitations on the boundary , carry projective representations of @xmath44 as in eq . .",
    "therefore , the boundary of the 3d spt phases are precisely the anomalous projective semion states .",
    "similarly , one can construct a trivial 3d spt phase which realizes the non - anomalous projective semion state on its boundary . with a slight modification of the @xmath0 haldane chains",

    "physically , it implies that if we put the 3d @xmath15-gauge theory @xmath47 on a three - torus and make one spatial dimension ( say the @xmath34-direction ) of the three - torus very small , then @xmath47 can be viewed as a direct sum of 2d @xmath15-gauge theories @xmath51 with degenerate ground state energy : @xmath52 the degeneracy is accidental and can be lifted by fixing a @xmath15-gauge flux @xmath49 through the hole bound by the @xmath34-axis ( dubbed the `` @xmath34-hole '' following ref . ) .",

    "there are 8 inequivalent such theories : 1 untwisted gauge theory and 7 twisted gauge theories .",
    "they can be distinguished by a triple @xmath87 , where the first , second and third entries are the berry phases associated with the exchange of two @xmath38 fluxes , the exchange of two @xmath39 fluxes , and the braiding of a @xmath38 flux around a @xmath39 flux , respectively . @xmath88 and @xmath89 can take value either @xmath63 or @xmath90 , and @xmath91 can take value either @xmath63 or @xmath92 , and the @xmath93 combinations correspond to the 8 different 2d @xmath0 gauge theories .",
    "the 8 theories are classified by the cohomology group @xmath94 .",
    "the trivial element of the group corresponds to the untwisted gauge theory , and the @xmath95 nontrivial elements correspond to the twisted gauge theories .",
    "the three generators of the group ( written multiplicatively ) , which we denote by @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 , can be taken to be the 2d twisted @xmath0 gauge theories with @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 , respectively .",
    "each dimensionally - reduced 2d @xmath0 gauge theory can then be represented by a combination of the three generators .",
    "the results are summarized in table [ tab2 ] .    to compute the three - loop braiding statistics in our walker - wang models ,",
    "we follow our earlier discussion to decompose a three - loop braiding process into two separate braiding processes in the dimensionally - reduced 2d systems and find the relation between their associated berry phases . in particular",
    ", the three - loop braiding process considered in section [ sec : gauging ] , where two @xmath38-flux loops are exchanged while both linked with a @xmath38-flux loop , can be decomposed into the following two braiding processes in 2d : ( 1 ) two @xmath39 fluxes exchanged inside a @xmath39-flux loop ; ( 2 ) two @xmath38 fluxes exchanged outside the @xmath39-flux loop .",
    "therefore , we have the following relation between the associated berry phases : @xmath102 where the first and second terms on the right hand side are the berry phases resulting from exchanging two @xmath38 fluxes either inside or outside a @xmath39-flux loop , respectively .",
    "similar analysis applies to the case where the roles of @xmath38 and @xmath39 are switched and we have the following expression : @xmath103    let us now apply eq . and eq . to two examples .",
    "first , we consider a walker - wang model with input @xmath104 . from table",
    "[ tab2 ] , we know that after dimensional reduction , we get the 2d untwisted @xmath0 gauge theory both inside and outside each @xmath0 flux loop , which implies that @xmath105 hence @xmath106 and the walker - wang model describes the 3d untwisted @xmath0 gauge theory .    next , we consider a walker - wang model with input @xmath107 . as in the previous example , we get 2d @xmath0 gauge theories both inside and outside each @xmath0 flux loop after dimensional reduction .",
    "the only difference is that the @xmath0 gauge theory is twisted inside a nontrivial flux loop .",
    "more specifically , we get the 2d twisted @xmath0 gauge theory represented by the @xmath108 group element @xmath97 ( resp .",
    "@xmath98 ) inside a @xmath38-flux ( resp .",
    "@xmath39-flux ) loop .",
    "we can deduce from this that @xmath109 together with @xmath110 they imply that @xmath111 and the walker - wang model describes a 3d twisted @xmath0 gauge theory ( the aps - x theory ) .",
    "we can carry out similar computations for walker - wang models with the other two sets of input data in table [ tab2 ] .",
    "we find that when we permute the labels @xmath69 and @xmath70 ( resp . @xmath69 and @xmath112 ) in @xmath107 ,",
    "the resulting walker - wang model describes the aps - y ( resp .",
    "aps - z ) theory .",
    "in this paper , we studied in detail the realization of the 3d @xmath0 gauge theories , both twisted and untwisted , in terms of walker - wang models .",
    "our proposal is based on the study of the surface topological order of @xmath0 gauge theories.@xcite we propose that if we take the input data of a walker - wang model to be the @xmath0 symmetry charges and the surface anyon content of a trivial ( resp .",
    "nontrivial ) 3d @xmath0 spt ( or rather their corresponding excitations in the gauged models ) , the output theory is a 3d untwisted ( resp",
    ". twisted ) @xmath0 gauge theory . to check the validity of our proposal , we perform 3d modular transformations to the ground space of our walker - wang models on the three - torus and extract the resulting @xmath1 and @xmath2 matrices . by making a dimensional reduction argument",
    ", we are able to deduce the three - loop braiding statistics from the @xmath1 and @xmath2 matrices , which determine the topological order in our models .",
    "note that there is a subtlety involved in doing modular transformations in walker - wang models . in walker - wang models , we work with a fixed planar projection of the 3d trivalent lattice . the strings living on the lattice are actually ribbons with the blackboard framing . therefore , it is important that we choose to calculate berry phases associated with the modular transformations that preserve the projection of the 3d lattice ( equivalently , the framing of the ribbon graphs ) .",
    "this is solely for the sake of convenience .",
    "otherwise , we need to transform the ribbon graphs back to the original framing after the modular transformations , and this introduces extra factors into the wave function .",
    "this is precisely the reason why we did not calculate the berry phases associated with the 2d modular transformation @xmath45 directly in section [ snt ] .",
    "@xmath45 changes the framing of the ribbon graphs , whereas @xmath1 and @xmath2 do not .",
    "thus , it is easier to first calculate @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and deduce @xmath45 from the relation eq . .",
    "so far we have only considered the walker - wang construction of 3d @xmath0 gauge theories .",
    "it would be interesting to generalize the construction to other 3d discrete gauge theories .",
    "it would also be interesting to find the connection between the walker - wang description and the dijkgraaf - witten description of these discrete gauge theories .",
    "note that the ground state wave function in the former ( resp .",
    "latter ) description is a condensate of loops ( resp .",
    "membranes ) , so the two descriptions should be dual to each other in some sense",
    ". it would be nice to make this duality more concrete and study how general it is .",
    "another interesting direction is to generalize the walker - wang construction to discrete gauge theories with ( at least one ) fermionic gauge chareges .",
    "the simplest example of this kind is a 3d @xmath12 gauge theory with fermionic @xmath12 gauge charges .",
    "this theory can be described by a walker - wang model.@xcite one can simply take a walker - wang model describing the 3d @xmath12 gauge theory , and `` twisting '' the @xmath7 symbols of the input data by a fermion .",
    "more precisely , @xmath113 takes the value @xmath42 in the fermionic case and @xmath69 in the bosonic case , where @xmath69 labels the @xmath12 gauge charge , and @xmath63 labels the vacuum .",
    "this example is interesting because dijkgraaf - witten models fail to describe discrete gauge theories with fermionic gauge charges . it would be nice to have a walker - wang description for more of such fermionic discrete gauge theories , especially ones that are twisted",
    ". we will leave these problems to future work .",
    "we would like to thank meng cheng , lukasz fidkowski , yuting hu , and zhenghan wang for valuable discussions , and especially yichen huang for discussions and collaborations during various stages of the work .",
