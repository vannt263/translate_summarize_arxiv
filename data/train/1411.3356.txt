    "prime numbers are those numbers which appear on the number line and are divisible by only 1 and the number itself . hence these numbers have only two factors .    in this paper",
    "we have presented a multivariate polynomial function termed as factor elimination function which is supposed to generate all prime numbers occurring on the number line .",
    "we call it as factor elimination because it generates a number by reducing the divisibility by most of the prime factors , we can generate small or big numbers from the function depending upon the factors and certain values taken under consideration . for the generated number some absolute conditions for primality are given .",
    "probabilistic conditions explain why the image of the function can not be prime , or could be a prime under particular probability conditions .",
    "the reason behind the various categories of prime numbers is also explained by this function .",
    "there are two cases , one is assured prime number generation where there is no need to pass primality test . while the second case requires a primality test to be passed and hence there is some definite probability associated .",
    "for any finite set of prime numbers , there exists a prime number not in that set .",
    "there are infinitely many prime numbers .",
    "there is no largest prime number .",
    "let us assume a set s consisting of prime numbers which is partitioned into two distinct sets of prime numbers a and b. @xmath0 where @xmath1b , @xmath2b = @xmath3 and n and m are some positive integers .",
    "consider the following mathematical operation defined as r @xmath4 let us now assume that @xmath5 is a prime factor of r. let w = @xmath6 .",
    "thus clearly w should be an integer , @xmath7\\div p_i \\\\ w&= ( p_1\\times ... \\times p_i\\times ... \\times p_n ) \\pm ( o_1\\times   ... \\times o_j\\times ... \\times o_m)\\div p_i\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] but the term , @xmath8 can never be a whole number because , @xmath5 does not belong to set b , and a prime number can not be factor of any other prime number .",
    "hence by contradiction , it is proved that @xmath5 can never be a prime factor of r.    similarly , let us consider each prime number @xmath5 to be raised to the power @xmath9 and each @xmath10 raised by power @xmath11 .",
    "then the resultant : @xmath12 again , let us assume that @xmath5 is a prime factor of r then let w = @xmath6 . thus w should be an integer which means , @xmath13\\div p_i \\\\",
    "w&= ( p^{a_1}_1\\times   ... \\times p^{a_i-1}_i\\times ... \\times p^{a_n}_n ) \\pm ( o^{a_1}_1\\times   ... \\times o^{a_j}_j\\times ... \\times o^{a_m}_m)\\div p_i\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the term , @xmath14 can never be a whole number because , @xmath5 does not belong to set b. thus we similarly have proved , by contradiction , that @xmath5 can never be a prime factor of r. this proof of contradiction shows that at least one additional prime number exists that does nt belong to set s.    the important thing to consider here is that if in some case a or b are empty sets , then 1 must be considered as the only element of that set for e.g a=@xmath15 and b=@xmath16 .",
    "for two distinct sets a and b consisting of prime numbers , let p be the largest prime number in either of the sets .",
    "@xmath17 let @xmath18 and @xmath19 ; then for @xmath20 let us name this function as the factor elimination function .",
    "we generate a pair of resultants ; @xmath21 by addition and @xmath22 by subtraction . the probability that r is prime is very high and it must be prime if , @xmath23 but practically , we realize that it is very difficult to verify @xmath24 p , and highly efficient algorithms are required . in that case , we can depend on the probability that , r is most likely a prime number , and we can determine it by the primality test like the rabin - miller probabilistic primality test [ 2 ] .",
    "it is well known that if a prime factor of r exists other than r itself , then at least one of those prime factors must be less than @xmath25 [ 3 ] .",
    "any prime number that is less than or equal to p , can not be a factor of r. if @xmath24 p and c = @xmath25 , then let the number of prime numbers which may be prime factors of r lying in between p and c be denoted by n. for this , we can use the prime counting function[4 ] and hence the number of primes capable of dividing r is given by @xmath26 where n represents the exact number of primes that exist between p and c. instead , we can also use rough approximation by prime number theorem[5 ] for calculating n represented by symbol @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28 as the value of r increases , the value of c also increases correspondingly , and the gap between p and c widens on the number line as a result of which the value of n also increases .",
    "this implies that the probability that a number could be a factor of r increases .",
    "so , it was concluded that , the closer r is to @xmath29 , the probability of r being a prime number increases .",
    "the total number of primes not greater than c which is @xmath25 is equal to @xmath30 . thus n represents the primes which can be possible factors of r. we can conclude from here that , the probability for event x where x is defined as divisibility of r by set of primes comprising of n elements .",
    "@xmath31 @xmath32    where 1-p(x ) represent the probablity of r to be a prime and for the case @xmath33c this probability tends to zero .",
    "let us suppose , we do not choose some prime between 1 and p. let t be the set of such prime numbers . consider r(p ) as the residual prime function which counts the number of primes in t. now the above equation ( 16 ) can be written as following @xmath34 for e.g @xmath35 let 5 be an element of the set t. we must not consider those values of r where the difference or addition of last digits from both the multiplied result sets a and b is divisible by 5 .",
    "we add an exception to accommodate r=5 .",
    "for instance , in the example above 6 and 1 are last digits for 36 and 1 respectively .",
    "+ the consideration of the value of r(p ) is very important when we talk of prime number generation algorithms and it should be minimum .",
    "additionally the set t should consist of larger prime numbers only .",
    "a twin prime is a prime number that differs from another prime number by two .",
    "there are infinitely many prime twins .    considering large pair of twin primes",
    ", we can say that the probability of getting a twin prime is square of the probability that we get a prime at @xmath33c .",
    "@xmath36 the important thing to notice here is that the probability of getting a pair of resultant as prime is equal in this case .",
    "this factor elimination function is also useful for giving a general mathematical form for most of the various classifications of prime numbers given till date .",
    "this is presented in a tabular form given below .",
