    "while the type - i seesaw mechanism is a very plausible way of generating neutrino masses  @xcite , it may turn out to evade experimental test .",
    "augmenting the standard model ( sm ) by majorana masses for the active neutrinos introduces nine new parameters ( three masses , and in the pmns matrix , three mixing angles , one dirac and two majorana phases ) , but there are nine extra numbers describing the masses and the couplings of the sterile neutrinos .",
    "quite generically , the sterile neutrinos decouple from the sm either due to their high masses or their tiny couplings , such that these extra parameters remain practically unobservable .",
    "therefore , leptogenesis  @xcite models based on the seesaw mechanism may likewise escape from direct tests .",
    "nonetheless , the requirement of successful leptogenesis is very useful in order to gain more constraints on the parameter space of the seesaw model , in particular when embedded in more general beyond the sm ( bsm ) frameworks .",
    "a very well known example is the lower bound on the masses of the sterile neutrinos , @xmath1  @xcite , which consequently implies a lower bound of @xmath2 on the reheat temperature of the universe ( assuming a vanishing initial abundance of the sterile neutrinos ) .",
    "numerous loopholes to this bound arise when considering extensions of the sm beyond the seesaw scenario ( we refer here always to the type - i variant ) , see _",
    "e.g. _ ref .",
    "notable are therefore the few possibilities that allow for smaller sterile neutrino masses and lower reheat temperatures , but that yet rely on the minimal seesaw mechanism , thus avoiding a further proliferation of free parameters .",
    "the most well - known of these is resonant leptogenesis , relying on the enhancement of the lepton - number violating charge - parity ( @xmath3 ) asymmetry due to the mixing of nearly mass - degenerate sterile neutrinos  @xcite . besides aiming for small sterile neutrino masses",
    ", it should also be of general interest to fully chart the viable parameter space for leptogenesis based on the minimal seesaw mechanism .    here",
    ", we consider leptogenesis from a source term that conserves lepton number but violates the individual flavours .",
    "its presence was first pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , and it was subsequently studied in a more accurate manner in refs .",
    "we refer to it as the ars scenario after the names of the authors of ref .  @xcite .",
    "it is based on the usual seesaw model given by the lagrangian @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the higgs doublet , @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the @xmath8-invariant antisymmetric tensor .",
    "the sterile neutrinos are given by the majorana spinors @xmath9 , for which we assume three flavours , @xmath10 , and the left- and right - handed leptons of the sm by @xmath11 and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 .",
    "we choose the usual flavour bases for the sterile neutrinos where their mass matrix is @xmath14 and for the sm leptons such that @xmath15 . for definiteness , we take @xmath16 .    in the ars scenario ,",
    "oscillations of the sterile neutrinos are the dominant source of flavour asymmetries ( that conserve total lepton number ) in the sm leptons @xmath17 at temperatures @xmath18 .",
    "the sterile neutrino masses are typically taken to be at the @xmath19 scale or below  @xcite , such that the couplings @xmath20 are suppressed enough ( note the seesaw relation @xmath21 , with @xmath22 the mass matrix of the sm neutrinos and @xmath23 ) that the flavoured asymmetries are only weakly washed out prior to the electroweak phase transition ( ewpt ) at the temperature @xmath24 , where baryon - number ( @xmath25 ) violating sphaleron processes freeze out . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is demonstrated that in spite of the low mass scale of the sterile neutrinos , no degeneracy is necessary in order to account for the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) .",
    "we add here for clarity that in the present paper , we use the term washout in both situations , when lepton - number violation ( lnv ) can be neglected for @xmath26 and when helicity flips through the majorana masses effectively violate lepton number once the temperature is of order @xmath27 .",
    "we refer to the former case , that yet affects the flavoured asymmetries as flavoured washout and the latter case as lnv washout .",
    "the case @xmath26 is relevant for the original ars scenario , where lepton number remains effectively conserved at times before sphalerons freeze out . indeed , since the sterile neutrinos are approximately chiral , one may attribute in that situation lepton number to these particles .",
    "transitions through the sterile neutrinos can however lead toward chemical equilibrium between the different flavours @xmath11 .",
    "if chemical equilibrium is fully established , there remain no individual asymmetries , due to complete flavoured washout .",
    "it is essential though , that the transitions to sterile neutrinos partly take place and affect the individual flavours in a quantitatively different manner .",
    "the individual flavoured asymmetries are then partly hidden from weak sphaleron transitions within the sterile neutrinos , what can result in a net baryon asymmetry .    here , we propose that ars - type leptogenesis is also viable with sterile neutrinos above the electroweak scale , more precisely in the mass range from @xmath28@xmath29 and mass ratios of order one .",
    "for the subsequent considerations , it is useful to recall the equilibrium neutrino mass  @xcite @xmath30 , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( @xmath33 being the hubble rate ) , such that @xmath34 . in the present scenario ,",
    "the flavour asymmetries are produced at temperatures above the masses @xmath27 for all three @xmath9 .",
    "given that the observed neutrino mass - differences are larger than @xmath35 and the large mixing angles , the asymmetries within each of the @xmath36 experience prior to the ewpt strong lnv washout , defined through the condition @xmath37 ( _ i.e. _ the washout rate for @xmath11 exceeds the hubble rate ) at some instance during the expansion of the universe .",
    "therefore , the conversion of the flavour asymmetries into a baryon asymmetry is less efficient than in the usual ars scenario .",
    "however , the mass differences of the sm neutrinos are not too far above @xmath35 , such that there should be parametric regions where the washout of the asymmetries is not prohibitively strong .",
    "to demonstrate quantitatively that this is indeed a viable option , we properly include in this work both the effects from flavoured washout and lnv washout , that take place after the creation of the flavoured asymmetries from oscillations but before the sphaleron freeze - out around the ewpt .",
    "it turns out that the stronger washout compared to the usual ars scenario can be made up for by larger initial asymmetries .",
    "we mention now some similarities and differences with related papers . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the see - saw model is constrained by certain flavour symmetries . as a result , @xmath38 couples to the sm particles in a way that leads to moderately strong washout , whereas @xmath39 couple much more strongly compared to typical realisations of the see - saw mechanism , such that large , purely flavoured asymmetries can be generated . moreover",
    ", the imposed flavour symmetry implies that @xmath40 , but it should be noted that as it is assumed that @xmath41 , only asymmetries from the decays of @xmath42 are considered and the scenario does not rely on a resonance effect . since leptogenesis takes place there during the decay of @xmath42 rather than during the oscillations of sterile neutrinos , it should be clear that the scenario from ref .",
    "@xcite is different from what is discussed in the present paper .",
    "this is also reflected by the difference in the viable parameter space in terms of the @xmath27 that is found for both scenarios .",
    "( here , the @xmath27 may be substantially smaller . )",
    "another variant of purely flavoured leptogenesis with sterile neutrino masses above the electroweak scale is discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where extra particles beyond the see - saw scenario are introduced .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in section  [ sec : calculation ] , we specify the way we calculate the bau in the proposed model and in section  [ sec : ex : scenario ] , we identify a viable point in parameter space and discuss some parametric dependencies .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in this section , we derive the equations that can be used to determine the freeze - out asymmetry in the ars scenario with sterile neutrinos above the electroweak scale .",
    "while the initial flavoured asymmetries in the @xmath11 can be computed using the same techniques irrespective of whether the sterile neutrino masses are above or below the electroweak scale , the washout calculation must account for the fact that the sterile neutrinos become non - relativistic before the sphaleron transitions freeze out , in contrast to the original ars proposal with sterile neutrinos below the electroweak scale .",
    "the most important consequence of this difference is that while the sterile neutrinos are relativistic , only flavoured asymmetries are washed out , whereas in the presence of non - relativistic sterile neutrinos , total lepton number is effectively violated by the majorana masses as well .",

    "in particular , we discuss the generation of the initial lepton asymmetry that applies both , to the original ars scenario and the situation with heavier sterile neutrinos above the electroweak scale , that is discussed for the first time in the present work .",
    "while the universe expands , the higgs particle and leptons are maintained very close to thermal equilibrium through gauge interactions , while the sterile neutrinos may be far from equilibrium over a wide temperature range , because they are only interacting through the yukawa couplings @xmath20 . as a plausible initial condition",
    ", we assume that the abundance of the sterile neutrinos vanishes .",
    "the sterile neutrinos are then produced from interactions with leptons and higgs bosons . for @xmath43 ,",
    "the fastest processes involve the radiation of an extra gauge boson ( @xmath44 processes )  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath45 , inverse decays ( @xmath46 processes ) dominate .",
    "now , provided the matrix @xmath47 is non - diagonal , the sterile neutrinos emerge as superpositions of their mass eigenstates and oscillate . as a result , these coherently superimposed states can decay into leptons @xmath17 and higgs - bosons @xmath5 in an asymmetric manner  @xcite .",
    "this way of creating an asymmetry is often referred to as @xmath3-violating from mixing .",
    "it is therefore interesting to note the temperature , at which the first oscillation is completed for a typical sterile neutrino with momentum of order of the temperature @xmath48 . in order to quantify this ,",

    "the oscillations can be averaged , what leads to a result in agreement with the usual perturbative calculations for the decay asymmetry of the sterile neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that when averaging the oscillations , the time - dependence of the source term is @xmath63  @xcite . since washout becomes important at much later stages only , most of the asymmetry is produced around the temperature @xmath64 .",
    "we recall at this point that for the conventional lepton - number violating contributions , the asymmetry is proportional to @xmath65 , while the purely flavoured source in the ars scenario is enhanced by the factor @xmath66  @xcite .",

    "it is however possible to identify regions of parameter space where , while imposing the observed parameters from active neutrino mixing and oscillations , the initial asymmetry is large enough and yet the lnv washout small enough yield asymmetries that are of order of the observed bau . in particular , we find that non - degenerate sterile neutrinos with masses substantially below @xmath0 may account for the bau , what has not been found to be viable before and allows for new cosmologically consistent bsm scenarios .",
