    "in the absence of other means , the age of a rotation - powered pulsar is estimated from its characteristic age , defined as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the pulsar period and @xmath6 is the spindown rate .",
    "although not exact , this value is generally a rough approximation of the true age of a pulsar , provided that the birth spin period was much shorter than the current period .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite have recently measured unusually low spindown rates of three ccos , an enigmatic group of young , slowly - spinning ( @xmath7 ms ) , radio - quiet but x - ray bright neutron stars at the centers of supernova remnants , which indicate unusually low magnetic fields ( @xmath1@xmath2 g ) and characteristic ages orders of magnitude greater than the host snr ages .",
    "a profound implication of this result is that the characteristic age grossly overestimates the true age of these neutron stars . by extension , many supposedly old radio pulsars ( @xmath8 yr ) may , in fact , be relatively young ( a few to tens of kyr ) .",
    "this may occur , for instance , if ccos provide an alternative formation channel that `` injects '' long period ( @xmath9@xmath10 ms ) , low spin - down rate neutron stars into the pulsar population .",
    "such objects may be masquerading as typical pulsars , in which case the conventional picture of pulsar evolution in the @xmath5@xmath11@xmath6 diagram may require substantial revisions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "these remnants may actually be the pulsar birth sites even though such associations may be dismissed as chance superpositions based solely on the pulsar s high value of @xmath15 .",
    "one possible manifestation of the youth of these pulsars should be unusually hot thermal emission from the pulsar , resulting in relatively high x - ray luminosity ( @xmath16 erg s@xmath17 ) comparable to or in excess of the pulsar spindown luminosity , as seen in ccos . to test this possibility we investigate the x - ray emission from the eight middle - aged / old radio pulsars within 6 kpc that are positionally coincident with galactic snrs .",
    "this study has important implications for understanding the birth , evolution , and properties of the galactic population of neutron stars , especially in light of recent discoveries .",

    "although we detect psrs b182214 and b090551 at high significance , their bolometric luminosities are not anomalously high ( @xmath66 erg s@xmath17 ) since they account for @xmath1@xmath67 of the pulsar spindown luminosity , consistent with the values observed for many ordinary pulsars ( see , e.g. kargaltsev et al .",

    "as they age and cool , these objects may eventually fade away becoming undetectable in x - rays as well .",
    "however , the sample of ccos is not yet large enough to know if they are intrinsically radio - quiet as unfavorable viewing geometries may cause the radio beams to not sweep towards us .",
    "previously , @xcite explored the possibility that isolated radio pulsars with @xmath71 ms and @xmath72 g are actually `` orphan '' ccos , namely , neutron stars whose snrs have dissipated . in this scenario , ccos maintain their weak magnetic fields but at some stage become radio - loud .",
    "none of the 13 objects considered were detected in x - rays , suggesting that ccos and radio - loud pulsars with @xmath1@xmath12 g are disjoint classes of objects .",
    "the dearth of low - field , non - recycled radio pulsars in the portion of the @xmath35 diagram occupied by ccos ( figure 1 ) , despite no observational selection effects against them , provides an additional argument against this evolutionary outcome .",
    "there is growing evidence that the apparently low magnetic fields of ccos ( @xmath73 g , as inferred from @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) may be the result of a submerged field , which may eventually diffuse outward on timescales of @xmath3kyr @xcite .",
    "therefore , ccos may , in principle , evolve into normal radio pulsars ( with @xmath74 g ) after @xmath31 kyr .",
    "the buried field will diffuse back to the surface on a time scale that is determined in large part by the amount of mass accreted ( ho 2011 ; vigan & pons 2012 ) . here , we have investigated this possible evolutionary path of ccos , assuming that the neutron stars activate as radio pulsars in the process . for the first @xmath1@xmath75 yr , rapid field growth would move a cco upward in the @xmath35 diagram .",
    "the location of several pulsars from table 1 in the @xmath35 diagram directly above the cco 1e 1207.4-5209 is consistent with this scenario .",
    "since there are 9 ccos @xcite with ages @xmath76@xmath77 yr and @xmath115 radio pulsars in snrs with comparable ages ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , if the cco formation channel supplies a portion of the radio pulsar population , we estimate that @xmath13 of the eight objects we have targeted should be cco descendants .",
    "however , none of the pulsars from the volume - complete sample within 6 kpc exhibit unusually high x - ray luminosity , implying that they are all genuinely middle aged / old rotation - powered pulsars .",
    "this suggests that ccos may not be latent radio pulsars but may instead be permanently radio silent .",
    "alternatively , this could mean that the buried strong magnetic fields in ccos re - emerge long after they leave their birth site and/or the snr dissipates . if in the process they activate as radio pulsars , ccos may be hidden among the population of ordinary radio pulsars . in this case , a systematic sensitive x - ray survey of isolated radio pulsars is required to identify the `` orphan '' ccos among them , using the unusually high thermal x - ray luminosity as a discriminant .",
    "if , however , orphan ccos remain radio - quiet , they would be difficult to identify as x - ray pulsars unless they are relatively nearby . as suggested in @xcite , a possible candidate for a cco descendant",
    "is the nearby radio - quiet x - ray pulsar calvera ( 1rxs j141256.0 + 792204 ) , although further investigation is necessary to establish whether the apparent lack of radio and @xmath14-ray emission is simply due to an unfavorable viewing geometry .    given that ccos may account for up to @xmath1@xmath78 of neutron star births @xcite , if they represent a truly distinct population the discrepancy between the galactic core - collapse supernova rate @xcite and the neutron star formation rate is exacerbated even further .",
