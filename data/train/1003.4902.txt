    "let @xmath0 be a flow on @xmath1 with countably many periodic orbits @xmath2 .",
    "we can look to each closed orbit as a knot in @xmath1 .",
    "it was r. f. williams , in 1976 , who first conjectured that non trivial knotting occur in the lorenz system ( @xcite ) . in 1983 ,",
    "birmann and williams introduced the notion of template , in order to study the knots and links ( i.e. finite collections of knots , taking into account the knotting between them ) contained in the geometric lorenz attractor ( @xcite ) .    a template , or knot holder , consists of a branched two manifold with charts of two specific types , joining and splitting ,",
    "together with an expanding semiflow defined on it , see figure [ charts ] .",
    "the relationship between templates and links of closed orbits in three dimensional flows is expressed in the following result , known as template theorem , due to birman and williams in @xcite .",
    "[ charts ] +    given a flow @xmath0 on a three - manifold @xmath3 , having a hyperbolic chain - recurrent set , the link of closed orbits @xmath4 is in bijective correspondence with the link of closed orbits @xmath5 on a particular embedded template @xmath6 . on any finite sublink , this correspondence is via ambient isotopy .",
    "we define a _ lorenz flow _ as a semi - flow that has a singularity of saddle type with a one - dimensional unstable manifold and an infinite set of hyperbolic periodic orbits , whose closure contains the saddle point ( see @xcite ) . a lorenz flow , together with an extra geometric assumption ( see @xcite )",
    "is called a _ geometric lorenz flow_. the dynamics of this type of flows can be described by the iteration of one - dimensional first - return maps @xmath7\\setminus \\{c\\}\\rightarrow [ a , b]$ ] with one discontinuity at @xmath8a , b[$ ] , increasing in the continuity intervals @xmath9 and @xmath10c , b]$ ] and boundary anchored ( i.e. @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) , see @xcite . these maps are called lorenz maps and sometimes we denote them by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 correspond , respectively , to the left and right branches .    in @xcite , holmes studied families of iterated horseshoe knots which arise naturally associated to sequences of period - doubling bifurcations of unimodal maps .",
    "it is well known , see for example @xcite , that period doubling bifurcations in the unimodal family are directly related with the creation of a 2-renormalization interval , i.e. a subinterval @xmath16 containing the critical point , such that @xmath17 is unimodal .",
    "basically there are two types of bifurcations in lorenz maps ( see @xcite ) : one is the usual saddle - node or tangent bifurcations , when the graph of @xmath18 is tangent to the diagonal @xmath19 , and one attractive and one repulsive @xmath20-periodic orbits are created or destroyed ; the others are homoclinic bifurcations , when @xmath21 and one attractive @xmath20-periodic orbit is created or destroyed in this way , these bifurcations are directly related with homoclinic bifurcations of flows modelled by this kind of maps ( see @xcite ) .    considering a monotone family of lorenz maps ( see @xcite ) , the homoclinic bifurcations are realized in some lines in the parameters space , called _ hom - lines _ or _ bifurcation bones_.    it is known that ( see @xcite and @xcite ) , in the context of lorenz maps , renormalization intervals are created in each intersection of two hom - lines .",
    "these points are called _ homoclinic points _ and are responsible for the self - similar structure of the bifurcation skeleton of monotone families of lorenz maps . so it is reasonable to say that _ homoclinic points are the lorenz version of period - doubling bifurcation points_.    in @xcite , williams considered lorenz maps with a double saddle connection , i.e. , such that @xmath21 , and introduced a new determinant - like invariant to classify templates generated by them , in @xcite these templates are called _ sub - lorenz templates _",
    "( note that , in a monotone family of lorenz maps , maps corresponding to homoclinic points have a double saddle connection ) .",
    "this invariant is a zeta - function that counts periodic orbits taking into account their knot type and the linking between them . in @xcite ,",
    "michael sullivan introduced one other zeta function that counts periodic orbits in positive templates , taking into account the number of twists in their stable manifolds .    in this paper",
    "we will study the effect of renormalization over these two invariants , in the context of sub - lorenz templates .",
    "symbolic dynamics is a very useful combinatoric tool to study the dynamics of one - dimensional maps .",
    "let @xmath22 , @xmath23 , be the @xmath24-th iterate of the map @xmath25 .",
    "we define the _ itinerary _ of a point @xmath26 under a lorenz map @xmath25 as @xmath27 , where @xmath28    it is obvious that the itinerary of a point @xmath26 will be a finite sequence in the symbols @xmath29 and @xmath30 with @xmath31 as its last symbol , if and only if @xmath26 is a pre - image of @xmath31 and otherwise it is one infinite sequence in the symbols @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "so we consider the symbolic space @xmath32 of sequences @xmath33 on the symbols @xmath34 , such that @xmath35 for all @xmath36 and : @xmath37 or @xmath38 , with the lexicographic order relation induced by @xmath39 .",
