    "in this paper , we study a simple two - dimensional model on a planar lattice where a large number of particles , all starting at a given site , diffuse independently .",
    "as the particles evolve , a concentration gradient appears , and the random interfaces that arise can be described by comparing the model to an inhomogeneous percolation model ( where the probability that a site is occupied or vacant depends on its location ) .",
    "we exhibit in particular a regime where the ( properly rescaled ) interfaces are fractal with dimension @xmath0 : this model thus provides a natural setting where a _ ( stochastically-)fractal geometry _ spontaneously appears , as observed by statistical physicists , both on numerical simulations and in real - life situations .    to our knowledge",
    ", the study of the geometry of such `` diffusion fronts '' has been initiated by the physicists gouyet , rosso and sapoval in @xcite . in that 1985 paper",
    ", they showed numerical evidence that such interfaces are fractal , and they measured the dimension @xmath1 . to carry on simulations , they used the approximation that the status of the different sites ( occupied or not ) are independent of each other : they computed the probability @xmath2 of presence of a particle at site @xmath3 , and introduced the gradient percolation model , an inhomogeneous percolation process with occupation parameter @xmath2 .",
    "gradient percolation provides a model for phenomena like diffusion or chemical etching  the interface created by welding two pieces of metal for instance  and it has since then been applied to a wide variety of situations ( for more details , see the recent account @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "based on the observations that the front remains localized where @xmath4 and that the dimension @xmath5 was close to @xmath0 , a value already observed for critical ( homogeneous ) percolation interfaces , they argued that there should be a close similarity between these diffusion fronts and the boundary of a large percolation cluster .",
    "for critical percolation , this conjectured dimension @xmath0 was justified later via theoretical physics arguments ( see for instance @xcite ) . in 2001 , thanks to smirnov s proof of conformal invariance @xcite and to sle computations by lawler , schramm and werner ( see e.g. @xcite ) , a complete rigorous proof appeared @xcite in the case of the triangular lattice .",
    "it is actually known that in this case , the interfaces are described by the so - called sle(6 ) process , a process which has hausdorff dimension @xmath0 .",
    "there is also a discrete counterpart of this result : the length of a discrete interface follows a power law with exponent @xmath0 , that comes from the arm exponents derived in @xcite . for more details ,",
    "the reader can consult the references @xcite .    in the paper @xcite ,",
    "we have studied the gradient percolation model from a mathematical perspective , building on the works of lawler , schramm , smirnov and werner . combining their results with kesten s scaling relations @xcite ,",
    "one first gets a rather precise description of homogeneous percolation near criticality in two dimensions @xcite , for instance the power law for the so - called characteristic length @xmath6 as @xmath7 ( here and in the sequel we restrict ourselves to the triangular lattice @xmath8 ) .",
    "estimates of this type ( and the underlying techniques ) then enabled us to verify the description in @xcite for gradient percolation , and to confirm rigorously that dimension @xmath0 shows up in this context .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to investigate `` diffusion front '' models mathematically , and to use our results concerning gradient percolation to show that their geometry and roughness can also be rigorously described .",
    "let us now present our main model in more detail .",
    "we start at time @xmath9 with a large number @xmath10 of particles located at the origin , and we let them perform independent ( simple ) random walks . at each time @xmath11 , we then look at the sites containing at least one particle . these occupied sites can be grouped into connected components , or `` clusters '' , by connecting two occupied sites if they are adjacent on the lattice .",
    "+   +   +    as time @xmath11 increases , different regimes arise , as depicted in figure [ evolution ] . roughly speaking and in the large @xmath10-limit , at first , a very dense cluster around the origin forms .",
    "this clusters grows as long as @xmath11 remains small compared to @xmath10 .",
    "when @xmath11 gets comparable to @xmath10 , the cluster first continues to grow up to some time @xmath12 , then it starts to decrease , and it finally dislocates at some critical time @xmath13  and it never re - appears",
    ". the constants @xmath14 can be explicitly computed , and even if they depend on the underlying lattice , their ratio is ( expected to be ) universal , equal to @xmath15 .    to be more specific , the phase transition corresponding to @xmath16 can be described as follows :    * when @xmath17 for @xmath18 , then ( with probability going to one as @xmath19 ) , the origin belongs to a macroscopic cluster . its boundary is roughly a circle",
    " we will provide a formula for its radius in terms of @xmath20 and @xmath10 , it is of order @xmath21  and its roughness can be described via the dimension @xmath0 .",
    "this is a _",
    "dense phase_. * when @xmath17 for @xmath22 , then all the clusters  in particular the cluster of the origin  are very small , and the whole picture is stochastically dominated by a subcritical percolation picture .",
    "this is a _",
    "dilute phase_.    actually , alongside these two principal regimes , at least two other interesting cases could be distinguished : the ( near-)critical regime when @xmath11 is very close to @xmath23 , and a short - time transitory regime when @xmath11 is very small compared to @xmath10 ( @xmath24 for any @xmath25 , typically @xmath26 ) .",
    "we do not discuss these regimes in the present paper .",
    "we finally study a variant of this model , where now a source creates new particles at the origin in a stationary way ",
    "one can for instance think of the formation of an ink stain .",
    "if the new particles arrive at a fixed rate @xmath27 , then after some time , one observes a macroscopic cluster near the origin , that grows as time passes .",
    "we explain briefly how such a model can be described using the same techniques and ideas .",
    "to sum up , our results are thus strong evidence of _ universality _ for random shapes in the `` real world '' .",
    "they indeed indicate that as soon as a density gradient arises , random shapes similar to sle(6 ) should appear  at least under some hypotheses of regularity for the density , and of ( approximate ) spatial independence",
    ". however , note that it is explained in @xcite that these random shapes are also somewhat different from sle(6 ) : they are _ locally _ asymmetric .",
    "as previously mentioned , our results will be obtained by comparing our model to an ( inhomogeneous ) independent percolation process , for some well - chosen occupation parameters .",
    "this process is now rather well - understood , which allows one to get precise estimates on macroscopic quantities related to the interface , such as the size of its fluctuations or its length .",
    "in particular , the interface is a fractal object of dimension @xmath0 , whose geometry is close to the geometry of sle(6 ) , the schramm - loewner evolution with parameter @xmath28 .",
    "recall that site percolation on a lattice @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the set of vertices ( or `` sites '' ) , and @xmath31 is the set of edges ( or `` bonds '' ) can be described as follows .",
    "we consider a family of parameters @xmath32 , and we declare each site @xmath3 to be occupied with probability @xmath2 , vacant with probability @xmath33 , independently of the other sites .",
    "we are then often interested in the connectivity properties of the set of occupied sites , that we group into connected components , or `` clusters '' . in the following ,",
    "we use the term `` interface '' for a curve on the dual hexagonal lattice bordered by occupied sites on one side , and by vacant sites on the other side ( the boundary of a finite cluster for instance ) .    in the standard homogeneous case",
    "where @xmath34 $ ] , it is known for a large class of lattices that there is a phase transition at a certain critical parameter @xmath35 ( depending on the lattice ) , and it is a celebrated result of kesten @xcite that @xmath36 on the triangular lattice @xmath37 : when @xmath38 there is ( a.s . ) no infinite cluster , while for @xmath39 there is ( a.s . ) a unique infinite cluster . at the transition",
    "exactly , for the value @xmath40 of the parameter , lies the critical regime .",
    "this regime turns out to be conformally invariant in the scaling limit , a very strong property established by smirnov @xcite that allows one to prove that cluster boundaries converge to sle(6 ) .",
    "one can then use sle computations @xcite to derive most critical exponents associated with percolation @xcite .    from now on , we focus on the lattice @xmath8 , since at present this is the lattice for which the most precise properties , like the value of the critical exponents , are known rigorously",
    " a key step being the previously - mentioned conformal invariance property @xcite , a proof of which is still missing on other lattices .",
    "however , let us mention that most results remain valid on other common regular lattices like @xmath41 , except those explicitly referring to the value of critical exponents , like the fractal dimension of the boundary ( see section 8.1 in @xcite for a discussion of this issue ) .    as usual in the statistical physics literature",
    ", the notation @xmath42 means that there exist two constants @xmath43 such that @xmath44 , while @xmath45 means that @xmath46  we also sometimes use the notation `` @xmath47 '' , which has no precise mathematical meaning .",
    "let us now describe the model itself .",
    "we assume that at time @xmath9 , a fixed number @xmath10 of particles are deposited at the origin , and we let these particles perform independent random walks on the lattice , with equal transition probabilities @xmath48 on every edge .",
    "we then look , at each time @xmath11 , at the `` occupied '' sites containing at least one particle ",
    "note that we do not make any _ exclusion _ hypothesis , a given site can contain several particles at the same time .",
    "we denote by @xmath49 the distribution after @xmath11 steps of a simple random walk starting from @xmath50 , so that the probability of occupation for a site @xmath3 is @xmath51 and we expect @xmath52 for some constant @xmath53 depending only on the lattice . for our purpose , we will need a rather strong version of this local central limit theorem type estimate , that we state in the next section .",
    "we also denote by @xmath54 the number of particles at site @xmath3 , at time @xmath11 .    roughly speaking , @xmath55 is maximal for @xmath56 , and @xmath57 decreases to @xmath50 as the particles evolve . hence , different regimes arise according to @xmath11 : if @xmath58 , the picture near the origin is similar to super - critical percolation .",
    "there is thus a giant component around the origin , whose boundary is located in a region where the probability of occupation is close to @xmath36 . on the other hand , if @xmath59 the model behaves like sub - critical percolation , so that all the different clusters are very small .        to describe the fine local structure of the boundary , we need precise estimates for @xmath60 .",
    "we use the following form of the local central limit theorem : @xmath61\\ ] ] _ uniformly _ for @xmath62 , @xmath63 .",
    "this equation means that locally , the estimate given by the central limit theorem holds uniformly : the constant @xmath64 comes from the `` density '' of sites on the triangular lattice .",
    "this result is sharper than the estimates stated in the classic references @xcite , in particular for atypical values like @xmath65 , and such a strong form is needed below .",
    "it can be found in chapter 2 of @xcite , where estimates are derived for random walks with increment distribution having an exponential moment . in that book ,",
    "results are stated for @xmath41 , but they can easily be translated into results for the triangular lattice @xmath8 by considering a linear transformation of @xmath8 onto @xmath41 .",
    "one can take for instance the mapping @xmath66 ( in complex notation ) , which amounts to embedding @xmath8 onto @xmath41 by adding nw - se diagonals on every face of @xmath41 ",
    "one then has to consider the random walk with steps uniform on @xmath67 .",
    "we also use several times the following a - priori upper bound on @xmath68 , providing exponential decay for sites @xmath3 at distance @xmath69 : for some universal constant @xmath70 , we have @xmath71 for all sites @xmath3 , for any time @xmath72 .",
    "this bound is for instance a direct consequence of hoeffding s inequality .",
    "note that if we take a poissonian number of particles @xmath73 , instead of a fixed number , the _ thinning _",
    "property of the poisson distribution immediately implies that the random variables @xmath74 are independent of each other , with @xmath75 .",
    "we thus simply get an independent percolation process with parameters @xmath76    as will soon become clear , this poisson approximation turns out to be valid , since we only need to observe a negligible fraction of the particles to fully describe the boundary : what we observe locally looks very similar to the `` poissonian case '' .",
    "for that , we use the classic chen - stein bound ( see theorem 2.m on p.34 in @xcite , or @xcite ) .",
    "assume that @xmath77 is a sum of @xmath78 independent random variables , with @xmath79 .",
    "then for @xmath80 = \\sum_{i=1}^k p_i$ ] , we have for the total variation norm @xmath81    now , assume that we look at what happens in a ( small ) subset @xmath82 of the sites .",
    "the distribution in @xmath82 can be obtained by first drawing how many particles fall in @xmath82 , and then choosing accordingly the configuration in @xmath82 .",
    "each particle has a probability @xmath83 to be in @xmath82 , so that the number of particles in @xmath82 is @xmath84 , and the chen - stein bound implies that ( @xmath85 in this case ) @xmath86 we can thus couple @xmath87 with @xmath88 so that they are equal with probability at least @xmath89 , which tends to @xmath90 if @xmath82 is indeed negligible . hence to summarize , we can ensure that the configuration in @xmath82 coincides with the `` poissonian configuration '' , i.e. with the result of an independent percolation process , with probability at least @xmath89 .",
    "we use earlier results on near - critical percolation , especially kesten s paper @xcite .",
    "all the results that we will use here are stated and derived in @xcite , and we follow the notations of that paper .",
    "in particular , we use the basis @xmath91 , so that @xmath92\\times[b_1,b_2]$ ] refers to the parallelogram with corners @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) .",

    "we will also use the property of exponential decay with respect to @xmath103 : for any @xmath100 and any @xmath104 , there exist some universal constants @xmath105 such that @xmath106 \\times [ 0,k n ] ) ) \\leq c_1 e^{-c_2 n / l_{\\epsilon}(p)}\\ ] ] uniformly for @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "_ in the following , we fix a value of @xmath109 , for instance @xmath110 , and we simply write @xmath103 , forgetting about the dependence on @xmath109 . _    the aforementioned approximation allows to use for our model results concerning the independent bernoulli case : we hence consider a `` radial '' gradient percolation , a percolation process where the parameter decreases with the distance to the origin .",
    "let us first recall the description obtained in a strip @xmath111 \\times [ 0,n]$ ] with a constant vertical gradient , i.e. with parameter @xmath112 : we will explain later how to adapt these results in our setting .",
    "the characteristic phenomenon is the appearance of a unique `` front '' , an interface touching at the same time the occupied cluster at the bottom of the strip and the vacant cluster at the top : if @xmath113 for some @xmath114 , this happens with high probability ( tending to @xmath90 as @xmath19 ) . moreover , for any fixed small @xmath115 , also with high probability ,    a.   this front remains localized around the line @xmath116 , where @xmath117 , and its fluctuations compared to this line are of order @xmath118 more precisely they are smaller than @xmath119 ( the front remains in a strip of width @xmath120 around @xmath121 ) , and larger than @xmath122 ( both above and below @xmath121 ) , b.   and since it remains around the line @xmath121 , its behavior is comparable to that of critical percolation , so that in particular its fine structure can be described via the exponents for critical percolation : for instance , its discrete length @xmath123 satisfies @xmath124      in view of the previous sections , let us introduce @xmath125 ( so that @xmath126 $ ] uniformly for @xmath63 by eq.([lclt ] ) ) , and the associated `` poissonian '' parameters @xmath127    since @xmath128 is a decreasing continuous function of @xmath129 , and tends to @xmath50 when @xmath130 , there is a unique @xmath129 such that @xmath131 _ iff _",
