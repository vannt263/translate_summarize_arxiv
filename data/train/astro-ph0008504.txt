    "the existence of extended dark matter halos with approximately flat rotation curves around galaxies is now well established . at small scales , the halo mass can be measured from stellar velocity dispersions and rotation curves , and globular cluster kinematics ( e.g.  reviews by & gallagher 1979 ; trimble 1987 ) .",

    "galaxy clustering measurements show that the excess _ light _ around a galaxy is @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the mean luminosity density .",
    "this also grows roughly in proportion to radius .",
    "the excess light is equal to @xmath15 at a radius of @xmath27kpc . on scales larger",
    "than this one is dealing not with individual halos but with the collective mass of collections of neighboring galaxies . here",
    "we shall restrict attention to smaller scales where it is reasonable to interpret the results as probing relatively stable and virialized halos of individual galaxies .",
    "the halos of early type galaxies can also be probed via x - ray emitting hot gas .",
    "this is valuable as it removes some of the uncertainty regarding orbital anisotropy in above analyses .",
    "unfortunately the halos are very faint , and only a handful of galaxies have the resolved flux and temperature data required ( kim & fabbiano 1995 ; trinchieri , fabbiano , & kim 1997 ) . in the best studied case ( ngc 4636 ) ( mushotzky et  al . 1994 ; trinchieri et  al .",
    "1994 ) the halo is very massive indeed @xmath28 .",
    "the line of sight stellar velocity dispersion for this galaxy is @xmath29  comparable to the mean value @xmath30 for @xmath15 galaxies ( fukugita & turner 1991 )  corresponding to a rotation velocity @xmath31 for the luminous region , whereas the x - ray mass at @xmath32 kpc gives a rotation velocity of @xmath33 .",
    "the mass of galaxy halos at radii @xmath34 kpc is of considerable importance both in the accounting of the matter content of the universe and in testing cosmological theories ( which are typically finely tuned to match the properties of massive galaxy clusters ) .",
    "however , the dynamical measurements suffer from systematic modeling uncertainties , and it is difficult to know whether halos like that of ngc 4636 are typical of ordinary bright ellipticals .",
    "gravitational lensing offers an alternative probe of the dark matter around galaxies .",
    "the manifestation of lensing which we shall exploit here is the weak ` galaxy - galaxy lensing ' effect ; the distortion of shapes of ( typically faint ) background galaxies seen near ( typically brighter ) foreground galaxies .",
    "clusters of galaxies have traditionally been the primary target of weak lensing studies ( see ( 1999 ) for a review ) .",
    "individual galaxy masses are far more difficult to measure due to their being less massive and hence yielding a smaller lensing signal relative to the noise . however , by stacking pairs of galaxies it is possible to beat down the noise and measure the total average halo profile",
    ".    in galaxy - galaxy lensing one measures the the mean tangential shear of faint ` source ' galaxies averaged over source - lens pairs binned by angular separation : @xmath35 where @xmath36 , for @xmath37 , is the shear estimate for the source galaxy , @xmath38 is the projected angular separation of the lens and source , @xmath39 , @xmath40 are weights for the lens and source , and the two constant matrices @xmath41 , @xmath42 are @xmath43 , \\ ; m_{2lm } \\equiv \\left [   \\begin{array}{cc } 0 & 1\\\\ 1 & 0\\\\ \\end{array}\\right].\\ ] ]    the expectation value of the mean tangential shear is related to the mean excess dimensionless mass surface density @xmath44 by @xmath45 with @xmath46 ( kaiser et  al .",
    "the dimensionless excess surface density is in turn related to the galaxy - mass cross correlation function @xmath47 by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the redshift distribution for the lens galaxies ; @xmath50 is the absolute magnitude distribution at redshift @xmath51 ; @xmath52 is the galaxy - mass cross correlation ; defined as the mean physical density at a physical distance @xmath53 from a lens galaxy , parameterized by the absolute magnitude and redshift .",
    "the quantity @xmath54 is the mean weight for galaxies of a given absolute magnitude and redshift .",
    "the angular diameter distance is @xmath55 where @xmath56 is comoving distance measured in units of the current curvature scale @xmath57 .",
    "the dimensionless quantity @xmath58 is defined as @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the redshift distribution of the source galaxies , @xmath61 is the mean weight for source galaxies at redshift @xmath62 , and where , finally , @xmath63 physically , @xmath64 is the ratio of the distortion induced by a lens at redshift @xmath65 in an object at finite distance @xmath66 relative to that for a fictitious source at infinite distance .    for the special case of a spatially flat cosmology , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , but such that their product remains finite . in that case @xmath69 , and @xmath70 . for the limiting case of @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 and , in the other extreme , for @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76",

    "they allow one to compute the expected tangential shear given a cosmological model , a theoretical @xmath47 , measured redshift distributions @xmath60 , @xmath49 for source and lens galaxies , and user supplied weights .",
    "the latter should ideally be determined from the image quality for the sources and from the brightness of the lens galaxies in such a way as to maximize the signal - to - noise , but the results above are valid for arbitrary weights .",
    "one can also calculate the variance in the mean tangential shear , and combining this with the formalism above yields the expected signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "this exercise shows that the s / n is rather poor if galaxies are divided into lens and source samples solely on magnitude .",
    "this is because the range of redshift at a given apparent magnitude is large , so there is a large variation in bright galaxy absolute luminosity and therefore in the mass .",
    "there is also a large range in @xmath78 values .",
    "photometric redshifts are useful in this regard to tighten up the distribution of foreground lenses , and allow one to boost the signal to noise by giving weight preferentially to the more massive galaxies .",
    "the above equations are quite general . for the special case of a power - law galaxy - mass correlation function @xmath79 then @xmath80 with a constant of proportionality which is computable from the lens , source redshift distributions etc . specializing further , for a flat rotation curve object the shear",
    "is given by @xmath81 this equation provides a convenient rule of thumb to convert between measured shear values and an equivalent rotation velocity .",
    "similarly , if @xmath82 we can characterize the mean halo profile in terms of an equivalent mean rotation velocity , which is convenient when one comes to compare with dynamical measurements on smaller scales .",
    "( the fiducial rotation velocity of @xmath83 is that obtained for an @xmath22 early type galaxy from faber - jackson measurements ( fukugita & turner 1991 ) ) .",
    "we return to discuss the value of rotation velocity as measured by a variety of techniques in  [ sec : disc ] .    early photographic measurements ( tyson et  al . 1984 ) gave an essentially null detection of tangential shear which seemed to rule out extended massive halos , though the upper limit was subsequently revised upwards ( kovner & milgrom 1987 ; kaiser 1991 ) .",
    "the first detection of galaxy - galaxy lensing was by brainerd , blandford , & smail ( 1996 ) . since then , a number of groups have presented estimates of galaxy - galaxy lensing , either from hubble deep field observations ( dellantonio & tyson 1996 ; griffiths et  al . 1996 ; hudson et  al .",
    "1998 ) , from observations of the rich cluster ac 114 ( natarajan et  al . 1998 ) , or from the sloan digital sky survey ( fischer et  al .",
    "these results demonstrate the practicality of the approach , but there are some uncertainties concerning their calibration .    in this paper we investigate galaxy - galaxy lensing using data collected at the cfht with the uh8k camera .",
    "our analysis differs somewhat from other works in that we focus on bright early type galaxy halos , as these are the only class of objects whose redshifts can be reliably determined from 2-passband photometry .",
    "however , while early type galaxies contribute only @xmath84 to the total luminosity density , dynamical studies of the local universe show that an @xmath85 elliptical has about four times the mass ( at a given radius ) as an @xmath85 spiral ( fukugita & turner 1991 ) , and these objects are expected to dominate the lensing signal at all redshifts .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in  [ sec : data ] we describe the data and the selection of lens and background galaxies . in  [ sec : results ] we present tangential shear measurements for lens galaxies over a wide range of redshifts . to facilitate the comparison with other studies and with predictions from simulations we characterize the halo profiles in terms of the equivalent rotation velocity for an @xmath15 galaxy . in  [",

    "we calculate the mass - to - light ratio of an @xmath22 early type galaxy and the contribution of early types to the closure density .",

    "this allows us to focus on a single type of galaxy  though it obviously precludes drawing any useful conclusions about later type galaxies  and may allow useful constraints on the evolution of halos over time and on the profile .    to a first approximation , galaxies can be divided into spectral classes within which the galaxies have very similar , and largely luminosity independent , spectral energy distributions ( seds ) . for each type ,",

    "should then generally be possible to determine both the spectral type and redshift .",
    "here we have only fluxes in 2 passbands , but this is still sufficient to select a subset of galaxies  bright early types  and assign them approximate redshifts .",

    "we can compute the contribution of these halos to the total density of the universe .",
    "this is , of course , only a partial contribution since only early type galaxies are counted  though they may well in fact account for the majority of the mass  and because here we have deliberately restricted attention to relatively small scales @xmath433kpc .",
    "we shall assume , as above , that @xmath14 , so @xmath434 where @xmath435 is the mass profile for an @xmath15 galaxy , and the density is then @xmath436 with the numbers from table  [ tab:2df ] we find this constitutes @xmath437 of closure density .",

    "if we assume that the stars are test particles on finite orbits in a roughly flat rotation curve halo , the @xmath15 rotation velocity at a scale of a few kpc is then @xmath440 . the corresponding mass is larger by a factor of @xmath20 than the value we measure on scales of @xmath441 . for interest , in figures  [ fig : shear4 ] and  [ fig : sheartheta4 ] we plot ( dotted line ) the signal which would be obtained from a galaxy with the same effective luminosity @xmath256 ( table  [ tab : fitsfl ] ) as our galaxies , but with the rotation velocity of @xmath83 ( the value determined on small - scales from faber - jackson measurements ) . clearly , in all cases , the predicted signal is larger than the measured signal .",

    "note that such a small departure from a pure flat rotation curve would be impossible to detect from either set of measurements alone .",

    "as discussed in the introduction , elliptical galaxy halo masses have been determined in a small number of cases from x - ray observations . in the best studied case of ngc 4636 ( mushotzky et  al .",

    "if representative of elliptical galaxies in general this would have weighty implications ( bahcall , lubin , & dorman 1995 ) .",

    "our results strongly suggest that ngc 4636 is indeed an atypical object , being far more massive than typical elliptical galaxies , and consequently that the contribution of these galaxies to the accounting needs to be revised substantially downwards by a factor @xmath20 .",
    "we now compare the properties of elliptical galaxy halos with halos of the same abundance in numerical cosmological simulations .",
    "this should be a valid test of theoretical models since we have measured the mass on scales that should be accurately modeled on the computer , and should be little affected by gas dynamics and star formation .    with the 2df luminosity function",

    "the mass here is the mass for an overdensity of @xmath455 , which , with @xmath456 , corresponds to radius of @xmath457kpc , and to a rotation velocity at that radius of @xmath458 ( shown by the triangle in figure  [ fig : mr ] ) .",

    "this comparison  simply matching the cumulative number density of halos to that of @xmath461 elliptical  should not be considered definitive , but it is the best one can do with the published numerical results .",

    "\\(2000 ) were the first group to obtain sufficiently high signal - to - noise to fit a power - law directly to their data . using preliminary data from the sloan digital sky survey they obtained a signal out to several hundred arcsec and measured a rotation velocity of @xmath467 .",
    "( note that the uncertainty here is a @xmath468 confidence limit not a @xmath469 uncertainty as for the other groups . )",
    "the interpretation of their results is somewhat complex because their lens sample is a mixture of early and late types , but the power and potential of galaxy - galaxy lensing was convincingly demonstrated .",
    "the analysis in this paper assumed that @xmath22 does not evolve with redshift .",
    "based on our knowledge about early type galaxy evolution with redshift this does not seem a grossly inaccurate assumption . from the canada - france redshift survey , ( 1995 ) found that their red ( redder than present - day sbc and hence early type ) sample was consistent with no change in @xmath22 between @xmath470 and @xmath471 ( their red sample was also consistent with a change of _ at most _ a few tenths of a magnitude )    we note that a brightening of 0.5 magnitude in @xmath22 for the highest redshift sample ( @xmath269 ) ( which might be feasible due to passive evolution ) would induce a small ( @xmath472 ) increase in @xmath473 .",
    "we assumed a flat lambda cosmology .",
    "if , for example we had assumed an einstein - de sitter cosmology ( table  [ tab : fitseds ] ) in preference to flat lambda , the inferred values of @xmath259 would still be approximately constant with redshift but would increase to @xmath474 for @xmath265 , @xmath475 for @xmath267 and @xmath476 for @xmath269 .",
    "the increase in @xmath259 in such a universe is primarily caused by smaller @xmath233 values in this cosmology ( table  [ tab : fitseds ] and figure  [ fig : beta ] ) .",
    "we would conclude a rotation velocity of @xmath477 for @xmath273 for this cosmology .",
    "unlike previous galaxy - galaxy lensing analyses we showed that it was possible to use colors and magnitudes to cleanly select one type of lens galaxy ( in this case bright early types ) . by measuring a weighted mean tangential shear which decreased roughly as @xmath478 we concluded that early type galaxies have approximately flat rotation curve halos extending out to several hundred @xmath479 . by assuming an @xmath250 relationship we inferred a rotation velocity for an @xmath22 galaxy of @xmath17 for a flat lambda ( @xmath480 ) cosmology ( @xmath19 for einstein - de sitter ) with little evidence for evolution with redshift .",
    "these halo masses are somewhat ( @xmath20 times ) lower than a simple perfectly flat rotation curve extrapolation from small - scale dynamical measurements .",
    "they are also considerably lower than the masses of halos found from the best studied x - ray halos although we note that the best x - ray example is likely an atypical object .",
    "interestingly , the values of halo mass determined from galaxy - galaxy lensing and and the masses of halos of the same abundance in lambda - cdm simulations agree remarkably well .",
    "we note , however , that for an optimum comparison , halo masses should be determined as a function of redshift directly from the simulations .      in the foreseeable future it will be possible to measure early type galaxy halo masses rather more precisely .",
    "the color - redshift degeneracy ( illustrated by figure  [ fig : lf ] ) could be broken by the availability of a larger number of passbands to provide photometric redshifts such as will be provided by the hawaii lensing survey , the deep lens survey , or the megacam / terapix consortium .",
    "more preferable would be spectroscopic redshift determinations such as will be provided by the sloan digital sky survey .",
    "the greater range of absolute luminosity then available ( limited here to @xmath6 ) will allow mass - to - luminosity dependence ( assumed in this work to be @xmath14 ) to be determined more precisely .",
    "moreover , increased numbers of early type lens galaxies will reduce uncertainties in the measurement of tangential shear and allow any variation in a @xmath481 ( i.e.  flat ) rotation curve galaxy halo profile to be determined .",
    "finally , the availability of @xmath482-passband data will also allow photometric redshifts for late type galaxies and a similar investigation to be undertaken into the properties of their halos .",
