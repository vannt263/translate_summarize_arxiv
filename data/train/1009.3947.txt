    "the _ prompt _ emission of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) is thought to be produced by particles energized in internal shocks occurring in an unsteady outflow ( rees & mszros 1994 , ramirez - ruiz & fenimore 2000 ) .",
    "the interaction of the grb outflow with the circumburst medium generates shocks that accelerate energetic particles which , in turn , radiate the so - called _ afterglow _ emission ( mszros & rees 1997 ) .",
    "the spectral , temporal , and polarization properties of that afterglow are fundamental observational probes of the outflow interaction with the surrounding medium .",
    "the x - ray afterglows observed by swift display light - curves with up to two inflection points or `` breaks '' ( e.g. nousek et al 2006 , obrien et al 2006 , zhang et al 2006 ) . a minority of afterglow light - curves exhibit a single power - law decay for decades in time , while the majority display an initial phase of slow flux decay ( a `` plateau '' ) lasting up to 1 - 10 ks after trigger , followed by a more rapid decline . while generally consistent with the expectations for synchrotron emission from an adiabatic forward - shock energizing the circumburst medium , there are cases where the decay is slower than expected for that model ( willingale et al 2007 ) .",
    "those slower - than - expected decays can be due to an interval of energy injection that powers the blast - wave .",
    "some of the x - ray afterglows monitored for very long durations display a second light - curve break that could be a jet - break ( e.g. panaitescu 2007 , racusin et al 2010 ) , although some of those breaks do not satisfy the expected closure relation between the flux decay index and spectrum slope ( liang et al 2008 ) .    at gamma - ray energies ,",
    "the prompt emission dominates the observed flux . in the x - rays , the fast - decaying tail of the prompt",
    "emission is also dominant up to hundreds of seconds after the trigger ( e.g. tagliaferri et al 2005 ) .",
    "this prominence of the prompt x - ray emission makes it difficult to detect the x - ray afterglow light - curve peak produced either when the blast - wave begins to decelerate ( i.e. when the reverse - shock has crossed all the grb ejecta ) or when the peak of the synchrotron spectrum traverses the x - ray band .",
    "prompt emission has also been detected at optical wavelengths ( e.g. akerlof et al 1999 , vestrand et al 2005 , racusin et al 2008 , wozniak et al 2009 ) .",
    "however , in the optical , the prompt emission is usually less prominent , making it possible sometimes to detect the peak of the optical afterglow ( e.g. molinari et al 2007 ) even when the prompt component is present ( e.g. vestrand et al 2006 ) .",
    "panaitescu & vestrand ( 2008 ) have studied the morphology of optical afterglow light - curves and have identified two prominent classes , of afterglows showing early peaks and afterglows showing extended plateaus .",
    "we have suggested that these two behaviors resulted from the observer being located initially outside the jet aperture ( for peaked afterglows ) and from outflows having a non - uniform angular distribution of the ejecta kinetic energy per solid angle ( for afterglows with plateaus ) .    in this work ,",
    "we expand our earlier study by adding new optical light - curves that display peaks and plateaus , and continue to investigate the possible reasons for the observed diversity of early optical light - curves ( section 2 ) .",
    "in particular , we explore another potential explanation : the onset of the blast - wave deceleration . in section 3 , we examine the correlation of optical and x - ray light - curve and discuss the mechanisms that can account for the diverse optical and x - ray light - curve relative behaviours .",
    "figure [ z2 ] shows the optical light - curves , transformed to a fiducial redshift @xmath5 , for all afterglows with _",
    "@xmath2 known redshift _ and _ @xmath3 sufficiently good optical coverage _ to allow a reliable identification of a light - curve peak or a plateau .",
    "a `` peak '' is defined by a full - width at half maximum less than a factor of 5 in time .",
    "a `` plateau '' is defined by the optical flux displaying a systematic change by a factor less than 3 over more than a decade in time , ending with a break and followed by a steeper decline .",
    "the above two criteria are the only used in selecting the sample listed in table 1 . with these selection criteria",
    ", we found 16 afterglows with optical light - curve peaks and 17 with plateaus .",
    "four afterglows display a broader peak or a shorter - lived plateau than defined above ; their peaks / plateaus are located in the @xmath6 plane around the intersection of the fits to the two categories of afterglows .",
    "peaky afterglows display a strong anticorrelation of the peak flux @xmath7 with the peak epoch @xmath8 ( linear correlation coefficient @xmath9 , corresponding to a probability of obtaining a stronger correlation of @xmath10 in the null hypothesis ) .",
    "the afterglows with plateaus exhibit a weaker anticorrelation of the plateau flux @xmath11 with the plateau end epoch @xmath12 : @xmath13 ( chance probability of 2.3 percent ) .",
    "the strength of these correlations is reduced if the optical luminosity is scaled to the grb output or the peak / plateau end epoch is scaled to the burst duration .",
    "the power - law fits shown in figure [ z2 ] were obtained by minimizing @xmath14 between the linear fit @xmath15 and the measurement sets @xmath16 , with the variables @xmath17 and @xmath18 being @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively , and @xmath21 being the uncertainty of each variable , in log space .",
    "the uncertainties arise mostly from our determination of the peak / plateau end locations and much less from the errors of reported afterglow photometry .",
    "the slopes shown in figure [ z2 ] are obtained assuming that the relative errors @xmath22 and @xmath23 in measuring the peak / plateau end flux and epoch are the same for both quantities ( @xmath24 ) and for all afterglows ( the slopes of the fits are independent of the assumed relative errors because the fits are done in log - log space ) ; the uncertainties ( given in parentheses ) of those slopes are estimates obtained by varying @xmath25 and @xmath26 within plausible ranges .",

    "we note that these anticorrelations ( in particular that for peaky afterglows ) are due , in part , to an observational limitation , as dimmer afterglows peaking at earlier times are more likely to be missed .",
    "figure [ z2 ] shows mostly afterglows with a peak near the bright edge of the @xmath39 distribution , and is quite likely that future more rapid and deeper follow - ups of grb afterglows will fill the lower - left part of figure [ z2 ] ( e.g. afterglow 080430  klotz et al 2009 ) .",
    "thus , the correlations identified in figure [ z2 ] define , more precisely , _ the boundary of a `` zone of avoidance '' _ in upper - right region of that figure .",
    "the important question is what generates these boundaries ?",
    "the @xmath40 anticorrelation for plateau breaks may only mean that , given the energetics of relativistic outflows produced by grb progenitors , afterglows with an optical output larger than about @xmath41 erg / sr are not produced",
    ". however , the much steeper @xmath42 dependence displayed by the edge of the @xmath39 distribution appears more likely to arise from the mechanism which produces light - curve peaks , thus _ that correlation should be used as a tool for investigating the possible light - curve peak mechanisms_.    figure [ lpeg ] shows that the grb output is well correlated with the afterglow optical luminosity at the peak or plateau break , as well as with the afterglow energy output in the optical . _",
    "the optical  grb output correlation is much stronger for peaky afterglows than for plateau afterglows_. this result should be tested in the future with a larger set of afterglows , as it may provide support to the `` deceleration - onset '' hypothesis for the origin of afterglow light - curve peaks and plateaus .",
    "we note that kann et al ( 2010 ) have found a tentative correlation between the optical luminosity at 1 day ( i.e. at a fixed time ) and the grb energy release for a larger sample of 76 afterglows .",
    "liang et al ( 2010 ) have also found a strong correlation of the peak luminosity or optical output with the grb energy release for a set of 17 afterglows , 5 of their afterglows falling in our plateau sample .",
    "for comparison , the slopes of the log - log fits obtained by liang et al ( 2010 ) : @xmath43 and @xmath44 , are smaller than shown in figure [ lpeg ] .    in the following subsections ,",
    "we explore three scenarios for the generation of light - curve peaks and plateaus , and assess their ability to generate the steep @xmath42 boundary exhibited by the peaky afterglow population .      the passage of either the _ injection _ frequency @xmath45 , which is the peak frequency of the @xmath46 synchrotron spectrum , or of the _ cooling _ frequency @xmath47 through the observing band causes a break in the afterglow light - curve .",

    ", @xmath47 evolves slowly ( @xmath53 for a homogeneous medium and @xmath54 for a wind ) .",
    "consequently , the passage of @xmath47 yields a weak steepening of the power - law flux @xmath55 by @xmath56 or @xmath57 for @xmath58 and @xmath52 , respectively , which is less than the break seen at the peaks and plateau ends of optical afterglows .    _",

    "_ possible failure_. this scenario can account for the fast rise of peaky optical afterglows , but has difficulty in explaining the slope of the @xmath39 anticorrelation shown in figure [ z2 ] , if that relation arises from jets having various orientations @xmath73 relative to the observer . in this framework ,",
    "special relativity effects lead to a received flux @xmath76^{\\beta+3}$ ] , hence , at the light - curve peak ( when @xmath77 ) , we have @xmath78 .",
    "rhoads ( 1999 ) has shown that the jet lateral spreading is dynamically significant when @xmath77 , it leads to an exponential jet deceleration @xmath79 , and @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the radius at which @xmath82 , after which the jet radius increases only logarithmically with observer time .",
    "thus @xmath83 , which together with @xmath78 leads to @xmath84 .",
    "then , the observed anticorrelation slope of about @xmath85 requires an optical spectral slope @xmath86 , which is much softer than measured typically ( @xmath87 ) , albeit at times after the optical peak .    _",
    "caveats_. however , the real @xmath39 anticorrelation could be less steep , perhaps only @xmath88 , and consistent with the misaligned - jet model expectation for a @xmath89 optical spectrum , for the following two reasons .",
    "first , there is an observational bias against peaks occurring earlier than those shown in figure [ z2 ] .",
    "afterglows peaking at an earlier time must exist , as shown by those afterglows which display a decay from their first measurement .",
    "the other reason is that the sample of peaky afterglows shown in figure [ z2 ] may be contaminated with early optical emission that does not arise from afterglow the blast - wave , but from the prompt emission mechanism ( the grb ) .",
    "indeed , three of the brighter peaks shown in figure [ z2 ] are coincident with a grb pulse . in these cases ,",
    "the true afterglow flux of the earlier light - curve peaks is lower than measured .    _",
    "contrived feature_. misaligned jets can also account for plateau afterglows if the ejecta kinetic energy per solid angle is not uniform within the jet opening .",
    "this is the model proposed by panaitescu & vestrand ( 2008 ) to explain the diversity of optical afterglow light - curves .",
    "an unattractive aspect of this explanation is its contrived requirement of another jet producing the grb emission , as the prompt emission from the misaligned optical jet is not relativistically beamed toward the observer .        for an impulsive ejecta release and a narrow distribution of the ejecta lorentz factor after the burst phase",
    ", the forward - shock synchrotron emission light - curve prior to the onset of deceleration displays a rise similar to that measured for peaky afterglows , and a decay rate compatible with the observations after the onset of deceleration . also , _ the onset of deceleration can yield a @xmath39 anticorrelation similar to that observed for peaky afterglows _",
    ", if that correlation arises from variations of the ambient density among afterglows , as shown below .",
    "+ there are two cases where a decaying light - curve is obtained after the deceleration timescale @xmath90 ( which is the light - curve peak time ) : + ( 1 ) @xmath91 and + ( 2 ) @xmath92 .",
    "+ in case ( 1 ) , different ambient medium densities among afterglows yield @xmath93 , hence an optical spectral slope @xmath89 is required to account for the observed anticorrelation , while the various initial lorentz factors of afterglows lead to @xmath94 , for which the measured anticorrelation requires a too soft optical spectrum , with slope @xmath95 .",
    "+ in case ( 2 ) , differences in @xmath96 or @xmath97 among afterglows induce the same anticorrelation : @xmath98 , which requires a rather soft optical spectrum with slope @xmath99 to account for the observed @xmath42 . + thus , there is one scenario : +    @xmath100 , @xmath101 , various medium densities     + which can account for the measured @xmath39 anticorrelation displayed by peaky afterglows .",
    "owing to the weak dependence of the deceleration timescale on the external density , @xmath102 for @xmath89 , the 1.5 dex spread in the peak - time shown in figure [ z2 ] requires that the ambient density varies by 45 dex .",
    "+ in this case , @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the wind density parameter , which depends on the massive star ( grb progenitor ) mass - loss rate @xmath105 and the wind terminal velocity @xmath106 .",

    "+ in case ( 1 ) , diversity in @xmath109 leads to @xmath110 , which requires @xmath111 , while various @xmath97 among afterglows lead to @xmath112 , which is the observed @xmath42 for @xmath113 .",
    "+ in case ( 2 ) , the result is the same as for a homogeneous medium : @xmath114 for either the @xmath109 or the @xmath97-induced correlation . + therefore , the deceleration - onset model accounts for the @xmath39 anticorrelation in the best way if +    @xmath100 , @xmath111 , various wind densities     + hence @xmath115 , and the wind density parameter @xmath109 should vary by 1.5 dex among afterglows .",
    "an extended release of ejecta , or one where the ejecta have a range of initial lorentz factors after the burst , can lead to a gradual injection of energy into the blast - wave because , in both scenarios , there will be some ejecta inner to the decelerating blast - wave , which catch - up with the forward shock . in these scenarios ,",
    "the forward - shock emission could be constant or slowly - decaying , followed by a steep decay when the energy injected stops being dynamically important .",
    "the correlation between the plateau flux and break epoch @xmath40 shown in figure [ z2 ] suggests a ( very roughly ) constant optical output among afterglows .",
    "therefore , the unifying picture for the peaky and plateau optical afterglows shown in figure [ z2 ] is that they all arise from the onset of the blast - wave deceleration , the former being identified with an impulsive ejecta release where all ejecta have the same lorentz factor after the burst phase , and the latter being attributed to energy injection in the forward - shock due to @xmath116 an extended ejecta release , @xmath3 a wide distribution of the ejecta initial lorentz factor , or both .    in the next section ,",
    "we compare the optical and x - ray light - curves of the identified two classes of optical afterglows , to search for differences in the correlation of the optical and x - ray flux histories , and to identify the models that can account for the diversity of optical vs. x - ray light - curve behaviours .",
    "in the forward - shock model , the flux power - law decay indices at optical and x - ray frequencies are equal if there is no spectral break between these two domains . if @xmath117 , then the decay indices difference is @xmath118 ( the x - ray flux decays faster the optical flux ) for a homogeneous medium , and @xmath119 ( the optical flux falls - off faster than the x - ray s ) for a wind - like medium .",
    "three caveats to the above results are worth mentioning .",
    "first is that these results stand when the electron radiative cooling is synchrotron - dominated",
    ". if it is due mainly to inverse - compton losses , then the fastest possible evolutions of the cooling break are @xmath120 ( thus @xmath119 ) for a homogeneous medium and @xmath121 ( hence @xmath122 ) , but the required conditions for this case to occur are unlikely to be maintained over a long time .",
    "the second caveat is that a slowly decreasing or constant optical flux results also for @xmath123 . in this case",
    ", an optical light - curve plateau is obtained if : + ( 1 ) @xmath124 and the medium is homogeneous , for which @xmath125 and the optical spectral slope is @xmath126 , + ( 2 ) @xmath127 and the medium is a wind , for which @xmath128 and @xmath129 , + ( 3 ) @xmath130 and the medium is a wind , for which @xmath131 and @xmath129 .",
    "we note that a rising afterglow optical spectrum has never been observed ( to the best of our knowledge ) , hence only case ( 1 ) above may be relevant .",
    "the third caveat is that , if energy is added to the forward - shock , then the evolution of the cooling frequency is `` accelerated '' and the difference between the optical and x - ray flux decay indices is larger . if the increase of the blast - wave kinetic energy is described by @xmath132 , then @xmath133 and @xmath134 for a homogeneous medium . for a wind medium , @xmath135 and @xmath136 .    using the above expectations for the forward - shock model , we define _ coupled _ optical and x - ray light - curves those for which @xmath137 is _ zero , 1/4 , or slightly larger than 1/4 _ , and",
    "define _ decoupled _ light - curves those for which @xmath137 is _ substantially larger than 1/4 _ , with the caveat that a decay index difference @xmath138 could be obtained for the forward - shock light - curves in the @xmath139 case , if the circumburst medium is homogeneous .",
    "additionally , _ decoupled _ light - curves are also those which display a chromatic light - curve breaks , present at only one frequency .    figures [ peak1][plat2 ] show the optical and x - ray light - curves for all afterglows with optical peaks / plateaus and with a good temporal coverage in the x - ray , which we were able to collect as of july 2010 .",
    "the implications of their coupling is discussed below .      the majority of coupled light - curves shown in figures [ peak1 ] and [ plat1 ] have @xmath140 , as can be seen from the good overlap of the shifted optical light - curves and the x - ray light - curve .",
    "in these cases , the cooling frequency of the synchrotron spectrum is not between optical and x - ray .",
    "different optical and x - ray flux decay indices are found for the peaky afterglows 050820 and 080810 ( fig [ peak1 ] ) , for which @xmath141 , indicating that @xmath117 , that the ambient medium is homogeneous , and that no significant energy injection took place ( as expected for peaky afterglows ) .    the well - coupled light - curves of the 14 afterglows shown in figures [ peak1 ] and [ plat1 ] indicate that a single dissipation mechanism ( forward - shock ) and radiating process ( synchrotron ) produce the afterglow emission at both frequencies . in contrast , figures [ peak2 ] and [ plat2 ] show afterglows whose light - curves display substantially different decays in the optical and x - ray or have chromatic light - curve breaks . the possible reasons for such decoupled light - curves are discussed below .      decoupled light - curves without chromatic breaks , such as those of grb",
    "afterglows 080129 , 090423 , and 090510 ( fig [ plat2 ] ) , may not require a different origin of the optical and x - ray emissions . instead",

    "for an energy injection law @xmath132 , a power - law distribution of electrons with energy @xmath142 , and a homogeneous medium , the power - law index of the synchrotron ( optical ) power - law decaying flux is @xmath143 while for the inverse - compton ( x - ray ) @xmath144 for a wind medium @xmath145 @xmath146 when there is no energy injection , the previous equations give the flux decay index by setting @xmath147 .    with the above results",
    ", it can be shown that the synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) model can explain the decoupled light - curves of the following afterglows : + @xmath2 080129  @xmath148 , @xmath149 , @xmath150 ( for an assumed @xmath151 ) , + @xmath3 090423  @xmath148 , @xmath149 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 , and + @xmath4 090510  @xmath148 , @xmath149 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 ( but here the resulting rise and decay are slightly faster than measured ) , + if energy injection is negligible after the achromatic light - curve break and if the ambient medium is a wind .",
    "for the peaky afterglows 050730 and 090418 ( fig [ peak2 ] ) , we can not find a set of parameter @xmath156 to accommodate their decoupled optical and x - ray decays within the ssc model with energy injection cessation at the light - curve break epoch ( model is overconstrained , with 2 free parameters and 3 - 4 observational constraints ) , which suggests that either energy injection continues after the break ( but with a different power - law exponent @xmath157 ) , or a different origin of the decoupled optical and x - ray light - curves .",
    "_ chromatic optical light - curve breaks_. they are observed for the plateau afterglows 080804 and 080928 ( fig [ plat2 ] ) and may originate from the peak @xmath45 of the synchrotron spectrum crossing the optical . in this scenario , the optical and x - ray light - curves should be coupled after the break . a simple test for the origin of the optical light - curve break in the passage of @xmath45 is the softening of the optical spectrum across the break epoch .    _ chromatic x - ray light - curve breaks_. such breaks are observed for the peaky afterglows 060607 and 061121 ( fig [ peak2 ] ) , and for the plateau afterglow 060605 ( fig [ plat2 ] ) .",
    "they suggest that the optical and x - ray emissions either ( @xmath2 arise from different radiation processes or @xmath3 have a different origin .",
    "the former scenario is an unlikely explanation because , in this case , the x - ray light - curve break can be produced only by a spectral break crossing the observing band , which is in contradiction with the general lack of an x - ray spectral evolution observed to occur simultaneously with a chromatic light - curve break ( e.g. nousek et al 2006 ) .",
    "the latter scenario is motivated by that , if the x - ray and optical afterglow emissions had the same origin , then a light - curve break arising from a change in the blast - wave dynamics should also be present in the optical light - curve .",
    "reprocessing of the lower - frequency forward - shock emission through up - scattering by another part of the outflow can yield x - ray light - curves that are decoupled from the optical provided that @xmath2 the scattering outflow has an optical thickness ( well below unity ) sufficiently large , to account for the measured x - ray flux , and @xmath3 the scattering outflow moves at a higher lorentz factor than the forward shock , to boost the shock s emission to higher frequency and to yield a flux larger than that coming directly from the forward shock ( panaitescu 2008 ) .",
    "a simple expectation for the bulk - scattering model is that chromatic x - ray light - curve breaks should be seen more often for afterglows with optical plateaus than for peaky afterglows .",
    "that is so if , as proposed here , afterglows with plateaus arise from an incoming outflow that adds energy to the blast - wave , as that outflow upstairs the forward - shock emission .",
    "in contrast , if afterglows with peaks arise from impulsive ejecta releases , then an outflow inner to the forward - shock should not exist for them .",
    "contrary to that expectation , only one plateau afterglow ( 060605 ) displays a chromatic x - ray light - curve break , while two peaky afterglows ( 060607 and 061121 ) have such a feature .",
    "taken at face value , the deceleration - onset model for peaky and plateau afterglows is in contradiction with this low - number `` statistics '' and , evidently , a larger number of optical and x - ray afterglows should be studied before drawing a reliable conclusion .",
    "nevertheless , we note that an outflow inner to the blast - wave may also exist for peaky afterglows and , while that outflow could carry too little energy to modify the forward - shock dynamics and yield an optical light - curve plateau instead of a peak , the upscattered emission from the incoming outflow could still overshine the direct forward - shock emission and produce a chromatic x - ray light - curve plateau .",
    "figure [ betaox ] shows the distributions of the optical - to - x - ray spectral slope @xmath158 for afterglows with coupled ( same decays , without breaks or with achromatic breaks ) and decoupled ( different decays or with chromatic breaks ) optical and x - ray light - curves .",
    "the simple result shown in figure [ betaox ] is that the afterglows with decoupled light - curves are , on average , brighter in the x - ray relative to the optical ( smaller slope @xmath159 ) than the afterglows with coupled light - curves .",
    "quantitatively , the difference between the average slopes @xmath160 of the two categories of afterglows is @xmath161 , which means that the x - ray - to - optical flux ratio of decoupled afterglows is , on average , @xmath162 times larger than for the afterglows with coupled light - curves .",
    "a similar conclusion is reached if , instead of the optical flux , we normalize the measured x - ray flux to that estimated from the optical flux assuming that the afterglow spectrum were a pure power - law . here",
    ", we define @xmath163 with @xmath164 , where @xmath165 is the intrinsic power - law slope of the optical spectrum . as @xmath165 is hard to determine accurately ( owing primarily to the unknown reddening by dust in the host galaxy ) , we use the value required within the forward - shock model by the measured power - law optical flux decay @xmath166 , with @xmath29 measured after the optical plateau ( i.e. when the blast - wave is adiabatic ) : @xmath167 .",
    "the constant @xmath168 depends on the location of optical relative to the cooling frequency @xmath47 of the forward - shock synchrotron emission spectrum and , for @xmath169 , also on the radial stratification of the ambient medium .",
    "the major assumption made here is that the constant @xmath168 is the same for all afterglows .",
    "for instance , if the ambient medium is homogeneous and if @xmath169 ( for which @xmath170 ) , we find that @xmath171 for afterglows with coupled light - curves and @xmath172 for afterglows with decoupled light - curves , the difference between the average values being @xmath173 .",
    "this indicates that the x - ray flux of decoupled afterglows is , on average , @xmath174 times brighter than for coupled afterglows .",
    "we note that @xmath175 depends on the constant @xmath168 , but @xmath176 does not , hence this conclusion is independent of the assumed optical spectral regime and medium stratification .    that the afterglows with decoupled light - curves have a higher x - ray - to - optical flux ratio indicates that there is a mechanism which operates mostly / only in decoupled afterglows and which yields more x - ray emission than the underlying synchrotron flux from the forward shock .",
    "that mechanism could be local inverse - compton scattering or external upscattering ( bulk and/or inverse - compton ) .",
    "alternatively , the higher x - ray brightness of decoupled afterglows could be explained if there were a process that reduces the optical emission of coupled afterglows .",
    "given that the media involved in grb afterglows are optically thin to electron scattering , that reduction of the optical flux should be due to dust extinction in the host galaxy .",
    "however , there is no obvious reason for which afterglows with coupled light - curves should undergo more dust extinction than decoupled afterglows .",
    "we note that the optical luminosity distributions of afterglows with coupled and decoupled light - curves are consistent with being drawn from the same parent distribution , a conclusion which also holds for the x - ray luminosities of these two classes . for all afterglows moved at same redshift @xmath5 , we find that the average optical flux ( in mjy ) at a fixed time ( 10 ks ) is @xmath177 for coupled afterglows and @xmath178 for decoupled afterglows . for the @xmath5 x - ray flux ( in @xmath179jy ) , @xmath180 and @xmath181 .",
    "thus , decoupled afterglows are on average only slightly dimmer ( by factor 2.0 ) in the optical than coupled afterglows and only slightly brighter ( by a factor 1.3 ) in the x - ray , the difference between the two types of afterglows becoming clearer in the distributions of the x - ray - to - optical flux ratio .",
    "based on their light - curves appearance , we identify two types of optical afterglows , with light - curve peaks and with plateaus ( figure [ z2 ] ) . in the plateau end luminosity  epoch plane , plateau afterglows show a @xmath40 anticorrelation that might suggest an universal afterglow optical output",
    ". however , the optical energy release during the plateau , shown in figure [ lpeg ] , has a substantial spread .    in the peak luminosity ",
    "peak epoch plane , the distribution of peaky afterglows displays a @xmath42 bright edge , with earlier and/or dimmer peaks being missed .",
    "we speculate that this steep dependence seen at the bright edge arises from the mechanism that generates optical light - curve peaks and we have discussed / investigated three such possible mechanisms .",
    "one is that optical observations are made below the synchrotron spectrum peak @xmath45 , which can also yield light - curve plateaus .",
    "this mechanism is easily invalidated by that @xmath45 crossing the optical should lead to a positive correlation of the peak / plateau end flux with epoch , contrary to the observed anticorrelations .    in our previous study ( panaitescu & vestrand 2008 ) , we have attributed peaky afterglows to the observer being slightly outside the jet initial aperture and plateau afterglows to outflows endowed with an angular structure and an off - axis observer location . for a typical optical afterglow spectrum ( @xmath182 ) ,",
    "variations in the observer offset angle induce a @xmath39 anticorrelation that is less steep than measured . however , there are two observational selection effects that could make the slope of the observed anticorrelation appear steeper .",
    "first is that rapidly slewing telescopes capable of observing during the first few minutes after a grb are typically less sensitive than those observing the afterglow at later stages .",
    "that means that faint , early peaks located in the left - lower corner of figure [ z2 ] are missed . the second factor that could make the sample of early peaks appear brighter is contamination from the prompt mechanism . a more troubling issue with this model is the required and contrived double - jet structure of the ejecta which it requires , with one jet moving toward the observer and producing the burst emission , and another slightly offset jet producing the afterglow emission and becoming visible after it has decelerated enough .    here",
    ", we propose another model to unify peaky and plateau afterglows , in which the two classes are related to the duration of the central engine , the light - curve peak and plateau break corresponding to the end of energy injection in the blast - wave and to the onset of its deceleration . in this model ,",
    "plateau afterglows are associated with an extended production of ejecta or with an impulsive one but with a range of ejecta initial lorentz factors , such that energy injection in the forward - shock can last up to 100 ks , while peaky afterglows are associated with an impulsive release of ejecta that have a narrow distribution of lorentz factor .",
    "we find that the exponent of the @xmath39 correlation is set by the slope of the afterglow optical spectrum ( @xmath183 ) .",
    "that slope is very rarely measured at the early times when the optical peaks occur ; at later times , @xmath184 for most of the peaky afterglows shown in figure [ z2 ] .",
    "the hardest optical spectrum for which variations in the afterglow parameters that set the deceleration / peak timescale yield the observed @xmath42 correlation is @xmath89 , obtained for a homogeneous ambient density .",
    "then , the observed range of optical peak fluxes ( or peak epochs ) requires the external density to vary by 4 - 5 dex among the afterglows shown in figure [ z2 ] .",
    "this model for the dichotomy of optical light - curves has a straightforward implication . for peaky afterglows arising from impulsive ejecta releases",
    ", it is quite likely that all the afterglow ejecta participated in the production of the burst emission . as some optical plateaus may arise from a long - lived central engine",
    ", it is possible that most of the afterglow ejecta did not produce the short - lived grb emission .",
    "thus , the _ optical output of afterglows with plateaus is expected to be less correlated with the burst energy than for peaky afterglows_. that seems to be , indeed , the case ( figure [ lpeg ] ) .",
    "we have compared the optical and x - ray light - curves of peaky and plateau afterglows and have found that , for 15 of the 25 afterglows with good coverage , the light - curves at these two frequencies are well - coupled , having the same power - law decay indices and achromatic breaks . for the other 10 , we propose the following scenarios to explain their decoupled light - curves : + ( 1 ) if the external medium is sufficiently dense , then local ( inverse - compton ) scattering may overshine in the x - rays the synchrotron emission from the forward shock .",
    "this synchrotron self - compton model can account for the decoupled x - ray and optical flux decays of grb afterglows 080129 , 090423 , and 090510 , but has difficulties in accounting for the light - curves of afterglows 050730 and 090418 . in this scenario ,",
    "the x - ray ( inverse - compton ) afterglow flux is expected to decrease faster than the optical ( synchrotron ) flux .",
    "+ ( 2 ) if the synchrotron spectrum peak passes through the observing band , then a chromatic light - curve break will result , which is more likely to be observed at optical frequencies , as for afterglows 080804 and 080928 . in this scenario ,",
    "the chromatic light - curve break should be accompanied by a strong spectral softening .",
    "+ ( 3 ) if a sufficiently relativistic and pair - rich outflow exists behind the forward - shock , then bulk - scattering of the forward - shock emission by this incoming outflow may overshine the direct emission from the forward shock and yield a chromatic x - ray light - curve break , as observed for grb afterglows 060605 , 060607 , and 061121 . in this model ,",
    "the bulk - scattered emission mirrors the radial distribution of the lorentz factor and/or optical thickness of the scattering outflow , hence the light - curves of the scattered ( x - ray ) and direct ( optical ) emissions are naturally decoupled .",
