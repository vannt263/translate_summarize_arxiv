    "of the @xmath6 galactic tev sources - ray sky map and source catalog , http://www.mppmu.mpg.de/~rwagner/sources/index.html ] , the majority ( 43 ) are identified as either pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) or supernova remnants ( snrs ) .",
    "the pwn class comprises @xmath7 of these , and it is likely that some of the unclassified sources will also prove to be pwne .",
    "most pulsars that are responsible for the pwne detected at x - ray and tev energies have spin - down power @xmath8 erg  s@xmath4 . in figure  [ hist ]",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast , there is scant evidence that any of the 17 known magnetars , with periods in the range 2@xmath012  s , produce x - ray or tev pwne . including both anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) and soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) , the spin - down power of magnetars is @xmath11 erg  s@xmath4 , as also plotted in figure  [ hist ] .",
    "because of their larger magnetic field strengths and different emission mechanisms from ordinary spin - powered pulsars , it is not predicted that magnetars accelerate particles to tev energies @xcite , except perhaps in their earliest stage of rapid spin - down @xcite .",

    "@xmath50 @xcite , rxj 1713.7@xmath03946  is closer , and an order of magnitude less absorbed than ctb  37b , while the latter is too far away to have been visible for 8 months as the chinese records indicate . given this better alternative , we do not regard the birth of cxou  j171405.7@xmath0381031  as having been established by historical records .",
    "instead , we turn to estimates of the snr age from analyses of its thermal x - ray spectrum .    using the _ chandra _  data , @xcite fitted a non - equilibrium ionization model and obtained a sedov age of @xmath113  yr for ctb  37b  assuming electron - ion equilibrium , while noting that this condition is usually not obtained in young snrs .",
    "both a higher ion temperature and efficient cosmic ray acceleration have the effect of decreasing the inferred age , perhaps to @xmath114  yr in the estimate of @xcite .",
    "@xcite then analyzed the _",
    "suzaku _  spectrum of ctb  37b  and estimated the age of the plasma as @xmath115  years in the brightest part of the remnant , which also required a relatively low ism density of @xmath116  @xmath117 .",
    "in addition , they found a region of non - thermal power - law emission and a smaller ambient density in the southern part of the snr .",
    "thus , the snr age estimate is broadly consistent with the pulsar s characteristic age , although the uncertainties in both values are large , and their applicability can be questioned .",
    "three magnetars are securely associated with shell snrs because of their central locations : 1e  2259 + 586 in ctb  109 , 1e  1841@xmath0045 in kes  73 , sgr 0526@xmath066 in the lmc snr n49 ( gaensler et al .",
    "2001 ) . to these",
    "we may tentatively add 1e  1547.0@xmath05408 because of its possible radio shell g327.24@xmath00.13 @xcite , and now cxou  j171405.7@xmath0381031  in ctb  37b .",
    "in addition to constraining ages for modelling of pwne , such associations are valuable for inferring natal properties such as magnetar kick velocity , and possible contribution of an assumed rapidly spinning proto - magnetar to the energetics of the snr expansion ( e.g. , vink & kuiper 2006 ) .",
    "theories for the birth of magnetars require short initial spin periods , of order a few milliseconds , in order to create their strong @xmath118-fields from a turbulent dynamo whose strength depends on the rotation rate of the proto - neutron star @xcite .",
    "the radio emitting axp xte  j1810@xmath0197 is the only magnetar with a directly measured proper motion , corresponding to @xmath119 km  s@xmath4 @xcite , a value which is not unusual compared to ordinary young neutron stars .",
    "@xcite noted that the displacement of cxou  j171405.7@xmath0381031  from the center of the shell of ctb  37b  would require a transverse velocity of @xmath120 km  s@xmath4 for an age of 5000  yr . the velocity would be unreasonably larger if the pulsar characteristic age of @xmath120  years is adopted as its true age .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite also noted that the brighter x - ray and radio emission on the eastern side of the remnant ( see figure  1 of paper  i ) is probably due to a higher density there , implying that the pulsar may still be close to the explosion center , which is not the geometric center , reducing its inferred velocity .    because of this non - uniformity in shock radius @xmath121 and ism density @xmath122 , it is difficult to use the standard sedov evolution @xmath123 as did @xcite for other snrs hosting magnetars , to estimate the energy @xmath124 of the explosion .",
    "the radius , which enters to the fifth power , is uncertain by at least a factor of 2 .",
    "nevertheless , if we use the values adopted by @xcite for the radius , age , and ambient density in the brightest part of the remnant ( their region 1 ) , an unremarkable energy of @xmath125  erg results .",
    "energetic input to the snr expansion from a presumed millisecond magnetar spinning down is therefore not evident , as was also concluded by @xcite for other snrs hosting magnetars .",
    "hess observations reported in @xcite localized the tev emission to the center of the radio shell of ctb  37b , and found that the extent of the tev source is compatible with either a centrally peaked gaussian of @xmath126 or a shell of radius @xmath127@xmath128 , consistent with the size of the radio remnant .",
    "the energy flux of hess  j1713@xmath0381  from 0.210  tev is @xmath129 erg  @xmath50  s@xmath4 , corresponding to luminosity @xmath130 erg  s@xmath4 , which we note is almost equal to the spin - down power of cxou  j171405.7@xmath0381031 , @xmath3 erg  s@xmath4 .",
    "previous authors have argued that particles accelerated at the snr shock are responsible for the tev emission from hess  j1713@xmath0381via pion decay @xcite or multi - zone inverse compton scattering of the microwave background @xcite .",
    "as it is not clear if the tev source has a pure shell - like morphology , it can not be ruled out that the pulsar makes some contribution to the tev flux , possible via inverse compton scattering from a pwn that is confined within the snr shell .",
    "since the tev luminosity of hess  j1713@xmath0381  is almost equal to the _ present _ spin - down power of cxou  j171405.7@xmath0381031 , a scenario for a pulsar - powered tev nebula would necessarily involve particles injected at an earlier time when its spin - down power was larger .",
    "however , unlike ordinary pulsars , it is not certain that magnetars can accelerate particles to tev energies .",
    "magnetar models that involve strong currents on closed , twisted magnetic field lines develop voltages of only @xmath131  v @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it is not excluded that the ordinary pulsar mechanism operates on open magnetic field lines of magnetars , which may generate particle - dominated winds that become shocked pwne , accelerating a fraction of the particles to tev energies .",
    "evidence for this possibility comes from the three magnetars that are also transient radio pulsars @xcite .",
    "even so , we caution that models for radio emission from magnetars @xcite produce average particle energies of only @xmath132  gev even on open field lines , because @xmath10-rays make pairs more easily in the strong magnetic field .    nevertheless , if high - energy electrons are generated in a shocked pwn in an early stage and escape the high @xmath118-field region , they can emit via inverse compton scattering into the tev band for an extended time @xcite .",
    "electron lifetimes against synchrotron and inverse compton losses are @xmath133 and @xmath134 respectively , for an electron producing a photon of energy @xmath135 by inverse compton scattering of the microwave background .",
    "the limiting lifetime of such a relic nebula is then determined by @xmath136 as long as @xmath137 g .",
    "the spin - down power of cxou  j171405.7@xmath0381031  was certainly large enough to generate a tev pwn during the history of ctb  37b , as long as it was born with a period significantly shorter than its present value , since @xmath138 erg  s@xmath4 .",
    "the current tev luminosity of hess  j1713@xmath0381 , @xmath139 erg  s@xmath4 , if radiated for 1000  yr , amounts to @xmath140  erg , which is @xmath141 of the initial rotational energy of the pulsar for @xmath142  s. thus , we consider an inverse compton pwn to be a plausible channel for tev emission from cxou  j171405.7@xmath0381031because it requires only a small fraction of the rotational energy to be deposited in very high - energy electrons .",
    "a possible prototype of such systems is psr  j1846@xmath00258 , the `` transitional '' @xmath143  yr old pulsar @xcite associated with hess  j1846@xmath0029 in the shell - like snr kes  75 @xcite .",
    "this @xmath144  s pulsar has a dipole field that approaches magnetar strength ( @xmath145  g ) and displays axp - like bursts ( gavriil et al .",
    "2008 ) ; it is therefore likely of an intermediate class connecting the rotation - powered and the magnetar pulsars .",
    "it is also one of the most energetic pulsars ; its @xmath146 erg  s@xmath4 is easily sufficient to power its x - ray pwn and the compact tev emission of hess  j1846@xmath0029 @xcite .",
    "however , kes  75 differs from ctb  37b  in that it contains a powerful x - ray pwn , while there is no evidence of an x - ray pwn in ctb  37b .",
    "although these snrs are of comparable age , any x - ray pwn in ctb  37b  may have evolved a factor of 10 faster than the one in kes  75 , based on the scaling of pulsar @xmath30 with true age @xmath147 such that @xmath148 for a given @xmath30 .",
    "the lifetime of a hypothetical rotation - powered x - ray pwn around a magnetar must be relatively brief .",
    "interestingly , @xcite claim to have detected the first x - ray pwn around a magnetar in an archival _ chandra _  observation of 1e 1547.0@xmath05408 , the magnetar of highest @xmath30 .",
    "although this would be an important precedent , we hesitate to interpret it as such because we have not clearly confirmed its existence in those data .",
    "evidence to associate any other magnetar with tev emission is sparse .",
    "the axp 1e  1841@xmath0045 in snr kes  73 is located at the edge of hess  j1841@xmath0055 @xcite , but this is not a likely association because the tev emission is @xmath149 in diameter and may conceivably have more than one source , as considered by @xcite .",
    "moreover , it can be expected that any high - energy particles are still contained within the snr shell , which is much smaller than the tev source .",
    "recently , an extended tev source that surrounds the massive , young star cluster westerlund  1 has also been reported by hess @xcite .",
