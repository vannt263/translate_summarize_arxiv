    "there are currently two grb afterglows for which a fast falling - off optical emission was detected at early times , only @xmath1 seconds after the burst .",
    "the general consensus is that this emission arises from the grb ejecta which is energized by the reverse shock ( * rs * ) crossing the ejecta and caused by the interaction of the ejecta with the circumburst medium ( * cbm * ) .",
    "this interaction also drives a forward shock ( * fs * ) energizing the swept - up cbm , to which the later afterglow emission is attributed ( the `` reverse - forward shock '' scenario ) .",
    "the rs emission was first calculated by & rees ( 1997 ) , who considered the cases of a frozen - in and turbulent magnetic field in the ejecta , and showed that , in either case , a bright optical emission ( @xmath2 ) is obtained at the end of the burst . & rees ( 1999 ) extended their previous calculations of the rs emission to a radiative evolution of the fireball lorentz factor and pointed out the importance of spectral information in constraining the rs dynamics and the magnetic field origin from the observed @xmath3 power - law decay of the very early optical light - curve of the afterglow 990123 ( akerlof 1999 ) .",
    "they also pointed out the possibility that optical flashes arise in the same internal shocks which generate the burst emission .",
    "sari & piran ( 1999 ) have shown that , if the peak frequency of the rs emission is assumed to be in the optical at the time when the optical emission of the afterglow 990123 peaks ( 50 seconds after the burst ) , then the expected softening of the rs emission and self - absorption effects can account for the radio flare reported by kulkarni ( 1999a ) .",
    "kobayashi & sari ( 2000 ) confirm the rs interpretation of this radio flare through numerical calculations of the rs dynamics .",
    "chevalier & li ( 2000 ) have presented calculations of the rs synchrotron emission until it crosses the grb ejecta , for the case of a wind - like cbm . for their choice of a high magnetic field parameter ,",
    "the rs cooling frequency falls well below the optical domain , which leads to a rs optical emission much dimmer than that observed for the afterglow 990123 at its peak ( 40 seconds after the burst ) .",
    "furthermore , such a low cooling frequency implies that the early afterglow optical emission should cease when the rs has crossed the ejecta shell , at the peak time of the rs emission .",
    "since this is in contradiction with the observations of the afterglow 990123 , chevalier & li ( 2000 ) have concluded that a wind - like cbm can not explain the early optical emission of the afterglow 990123 .",
    "constraints on the fireball initial lorentz factor have been obtained by soderberg & ramirez - ruiz ( 2003 ) for several afterglows by comparing the observed radio emission at @xmath4 day with the model rs emission , under the assumption that the rs magnetic field and typical electron energy parameters ( which we shall call * microphysical parameters * ) are those determined for the fs from fits to the broadband emission of those afterglows ( panaitescu & kumar 2001 ) .",
    "zhang , kobayashi & ( 2003 ) have noted that the ratios of the rs and fs peak fluxes , and peak and cooling frequencies depend only on the fireball initial lorentz factor and the ratio of the magnetic fields , to develop a method of constraining these two quantities , and have shown that the optical emission of the afterglow 990123 requires a magnetized outflow .    in this work",
    "we use the general properties ( flux , epochs during which power - law decays are observed , decay slopes  see table 1 ) of the radio and optical emissions of the afterglows 990123 and 021211 to constrain the ejecta ( isotropic - equivalent ) kinetic energy , cbm density , and the microphysical parameters for the reverse - forward shock scenario (  [ rf ] ) , for either a homogeneous or wind - like profile of the cbm .",
    "in contrast with other works , we take into account all constraints arising from the radio and optical measurements of the grb afterglows 990123 and 021211 and we do not assume certain values for any of the model parameters .",
    "we also investigate a `` wind - bubble '' scenario (  [ bb ] ) , where all the radio and optical emission arises in the fs , with a negligible contribution from the rs ( which is verified numerically ) , the mitigation of the optical decays observed in the afterglows 990123 and 021211 being due to the fs crossing the bubble termination shock , i.e. transiting from a wind - like cbm structure to a homogeneous region of shocked wind .",
    "for both scenarios , we consider either adiabatic or radiative dynamics , the resulting microphysical parameters being checked for consistency with the assumed dynamical regime .",
    "we begin by calculating the spectral properties ( break frequencies and peak flux ) of the rs emission at the radius @xmath5 where the rs finishes crossing the ejecta shell and the injection of fresh electrons by the rs ceases . because most of the ejecta kinetic energy has been transferred to the forward shock at @xmath5 , the radius @xmath5 marks the onset of a steeper power - law decrease of the bulk lorentz factor @xmath6 with radius .",
    "after @xmath5 , the spectral properties of the rs emission can be calculated from the adiabatic evolution of the electrons and magnetic field .",
    "the spectral properties of the fs emission can also be calculated from those at @xmath5 or directly from the dynamics of the fireball after @xmath5 ( without passing through the parameters at @xmath5 ) if the shock dynamics is adiabatic .",
    "each shock compresses the fluid ahead of it by a factor @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the lorentz factor of the shocked fluid as measured in the frame of the yet unshocked gas , and heats it to a energy per particle equal to @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , the pressure equality at the contact discontinuity which separates the shocked ejecta and cbm , implies that @xmath10 where @xmath6 is the lorentz factor of the shocked fluid in the laboratory frame , and @xmath11 , @xmath12 are the proton number densities of the unshocked ejecta and of the cbm , respectively , each measured in the corresponding comoving frame .",
    "from addition of velocities in special relativity , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the initial lorentz factor of the ejecta , @xmath15 denotes velocities and @xmath16 , @xmath17 were used in the approximation . substituting equation ( [ g2 ] ) in ( [ g1 ] ) ,",
    "one obtains a fourth - degree equation for @xmath6 , which can be cast in the form @xmath18 n_{ej } = 4 \\gamma^2 n \\;. \\label{g3}\\ ] ] because @xmath19 , the first term in the square bracket is at least eight times larger than the last term .",
    "ignoring the @xmath20 term , the solution of equation ( [ g3 ] ) is @xmath21^{1/2 } } \\;. \\label{g4}\\ ] ] the limiting cases for the lorentz factor are @xmath22 therefore , in the limit of very dense ejecta , the lorentz factor of the shocked fluid is the same as that of the unshocked ejecta , while for more tenuous ejecta , @xmath6 depends on the ratio of the comoving densities .",
    "note that the ratio @xmath11 and @xmath23 changes with the fireball radius @xmath24 : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the fireball ejecta energy ( or , if the outflow is collimated , its isotropic equivalent ) , @xmath27 is the proton s mass , @xmath28 is the ejecta geometrical thickness measured in the laboratory frame ( thus @xmath29 is the comoving frame thickness ) , and we restricted our calculations to two simple radial structures of the cbm , either homogeneous ( @xmath30 ) of particle density @xmath12 or a @xmath31 stratification ( @xmath32 ) corresponding to a wind expelled by the grb progenitor . in the latter case , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the mass - loss rate to wind speed ratio , normalized to @xmath35 . by denoting @xmath36",
    "the ratio of the comoving densities is @xmath37 the ejecta - shell thickness , @xmath38 , is the largest of its initial thickness @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the laboratory frame duration of the grb ejecta release by their source , and the expansion due to a spread in the radial outflow velocity of the ejecta particles .",
    "this velocity spread can be either a relic of the initial , super - eddington radiation pressure in the fireball , or to an imperfect collimation in the radial direction of the ejecta particles at the end of the fireball acceleration .",
    "the former leads to a comoving - frame expansion of the shell at the sound speed , the latter is expected to produce a spread of order @xmath41 in the ejecta particles direction of motion ( , laguna & rees 1993 ) . in either case , the resulting contribution to the shell thickness evolution is @xmath42 , therefore @xmath43 as shown by kumar & panaitescu ( 2003 ) , the difference between the laboratory frame speeds of the unshocked ejecta and that of the rs is @xmath44 for a wide range of the ratio @xmath45 . from here , one can calculate the radius @xmath5 at which the rs finishes crossing the ejecta shell : @xmath46 once @xmath5 is known , equations ( [ g4 ] ) , ( [ n ] ) and ( [ d ] ) give the lorentz factor @xmath6 at the shock - crossing radius @xmath5 and all the properties of the rs and fs emissions at @xmath5 , which can be then extrapolated at @xmath47 .",
    "we proceed by considering separately ejecta shells for which @xmath48 and @xmath49 . in the former case",
    ", the ejecta shell undergoes a significant spreading while the rs propagates into it , while in the latter case the spreading is negligible . the usual terminology",
    "( sari & piran 1995 ) is that of `` thin ejecta '' for the former and `` thick ejecta '' for the latter .",
    "the substitution of equations ( [ n ] ) and ( [ bdiff ] ) in ( [ rcross ] ) leads to @xmath51 @xmath52 where the usual notation @xmath53 has been used . the defining condition for this case , @xmath54 , becomes @xmath55^{1/8 } =                 670\\ ; \\left ( \\frac{e_{53}}{n_0 \\tau_0 ^ 3 } \\right)^{1/8 } \\;\\ ; { \\rm for } \\;\\ ; s=0   \\label{gmin0}\\ ] ] @xmath56 from equation ( [ n ] ) , the density ratio at @xmath5 is @xmath57 comparing with equation ( [ g4 ] ) , this shows that at @xmath5 the lorentz factor of shocked gas is in an intermediate regime : @xmath58    besides @xmath59 , two other quantities are of interest at the ejecta shock - crossing radius : the energy of the swept - up cbm , @xmath60 , and the corresponding observer frame time , @xmath61 .",
    "the total energy of the shocked cbm is @xmath62 larger than its rest - mass energy , thus @xmath63 the arrival time @xmath64 corresponding to the contact discontinuity and the fluid moving toward the observer is given by @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the burst redshift . substituting @xmath6 from equation ( [ g4 ] ) in equations ( [ ecbm ] ) and ( [ dt ] ) ,",
    "one obtains @xmath67 @xmath68 thus less than half of the initial ejecta energy has been dissipated by the fs by the time when the rs crosses the ejecta shell .",
    "this means that the shock crossing radius @xmath5 is slightly smaller than the usual deceleration radius @xmath69 defined by @xmath70 .",
    "once again , using equations ( [ n ] ) and ( [ bdiff ] ) in ( [ rcross ] ) , one obtains that @xmath72 @xmath73 the requirement that @xmath49 leads to the reversed inequalities given in equations ( [ gmin0 ] ) and ( [ gmin2 ] ) .",
    "the density ratio ( equation [ n ] ) at @xmath5 is @xmath74 because in the thick shell case the ejecta density is lower than for a thin shell , the values given in the @xmath75 of equation ( [ nratio ] ) are upper limits for the density ratio . substituting equation ( [ nr ] ) in the second regime given in equation ( [ g5 ] ) leads to @xmath76^{1/8 } =                               530\\ ; \\left ( \\frac{e_{53}}{n_0 \\tau_0 ^ 3 } \\right)^{1/8 }   \\label{g7}\\ ] ] @xmath77    note from equations ( [ g7 ] ) and ( [ g8 ] ) that , for a thick ejecta shell , the lorentz factor @xmath6 of the shocked ejecta is independent of that of the unshocked ejecta , @xmath14 . thus , for a sufficiently tenuous ejecta , the contrast between @xmath14 and @xmath6 can be sufficiently large that the rs is relativistic ( equation [ g2 ] ) in the frame of the incoming ejecta .",
    "in contrast , in the thin ejecta case , equations ( [ g2 ] ) and ( [ g6 ] ) lead to @xmath78 for @xmath30 and @xmath79 for @xmath32 , the rs propagating in a thin ejecta shell is trans - relativistic",
    ".    the energy dissipated by the fs at @xmath80 and the ejecta shell shock - crossing time are @xmath81 for either type of medium .",
    "note that , as for a thin ejecta shell , the shock - crossing radius @xmath5 is close to the usual deceleration radius .",
    "furthermore , for a thick ejecta shell , the observer frame shock - crossing time @xmath61 is fairly close to the laboratory frame duration of the ejecta release . given that @xmath61 is roughly the timescale for dissipating the ejecta kinetic energy and that , most likely , the shock - accelerated electrons cool faster than the dynamical timescale , we expect that the duration of an external shock grb is close to @xmath61 .",
    "the simple temporal structure of the grbs 990123 and 021211 may suggest that they originate in an external shock , nevertheless it is entirely possible that both bursts were produced in internal shocks occurring in an outflow with a fluctuating ejection lorentz factor ( rees & 1994 ) . in this case , the internal shocks take place at the radius @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the lorentz factor of the slower shells ; the shocked fluid moves at @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the lorentz factor of the faster shells ; therefore the observed burst duration is @xmath86 . since a high dissipation efficiency requires a large contrast between the lorentz factors of various ejecta shells ( @xmath87 ) , the burst duration sets only a lower limit on the duration of the ejecta release , @xmath40 .",
    "we shall use this constraint when choosing the shock - crossing time @xmath61 for the grbs 990123 and 021211 for the case of a thick ejecta shell .",
    "the synchrotron emission from either shock at any observing frequency is determined by the peak flux @xmath88 , the three break frequencies  absorption @xmath89 , injection @xmath90 , and cooling @xmath91  and the slope of the afterglow spectrum between its break frequencies .",
    "the peak of the @xmath92 synchrotron spectrum , which is at the frequency @xmath93 , is given by @xmath94 where @xmath66 is the burst redshift , @xmath95 the luminosity distance ( in a @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 universe ) , @xmath99 is the number of radiating electrons , and the factor @xmath6 accounts for the average relativistic boost of the comoving frame synchrotron power @xmath100 per electron at the peak frequency @xmath101 .",
    "the doppler boost @xmath6 appears at only the first power in equation ( [ fp ] ) because the observer receives emission for an area subtending an angle of @xmath102 radians , from a fraction @xmath103 of the total number of electrons @xmath99 .",

    "the magnetic field is parameterized by the fraction @xmath109 of the post - shock energy density stored in it .",

    "the slopes of the piece - wise synchrotron spectrum from the broken power - law electron distribution with energy resulting from shock - acceleration and radiative cooling are described in detail by sari , piran & narayan ( 1998 ) .",
    "note that , for @xmath47 , the rs electron distribution has a sharp cut - off at @xmath128 , as the injection of electrons stops when the rs has crossed the ejecta shell , which leads to an abrupt switch - off of the rs emission at a given frequency when @xmath91 drops below that frequency .",

    "this means that a highly radiative regime corresponds to a fractional energy loss of about 90% within the first day after the burst .",
    "note that for such high radiative losses to occur in an afterglow , fs electrons should acquire a substantial fraction of the energy dissipated by the shock and should radiate it quicker that the dynamical timescale , which requires a sufficiently high magnetic field , a sufficiently large parameter @xmath109 and dense cbm .",

    "because @xmath270 , the dynamics may be radiative for @xmath279 and @xmath269 , while a significantly lower @xmath280 would ensure an adiabatic dynamical regime .",
    "note that a high @xmath281 ergs , more than 100 times larger than the burst output , is required by a wind density corresponding to @xmath282 , slightly below that of a wr star . from the constraints on the fs parameters , chevalier , li & fransson ( 2004 ) have also concluded that a weak wind with @xmath283 is required for the afterglow 021211 , however , in their calculations , the fs cooling frequency was placed below the optical .",
    "if we impose the same constraint here , we do not find any solutions for the rs microphysical parameters .",
    "the similarity of the decay indices of the optical light - curves of the afterglows 990123 and 021211 before and after @xmath284 may suggest that a single mechanism produces the entire optical afterglow emission .",
    "time - varying microphysical parameters , including the slope of the power - law electron energy distribution , could cause a change in the optical light - curve decay index , however such an explanation is in contradiction with the consistency seen in many afterglows between the optical spectral slope and light - curve decay index at times of order 1 day .",
    "if the fs is the only mechanism producing the detected afterglow emission and if microphysical parameters are constant , then the non - monotonic behaviour of the optical light - curves of the afterglows 990123 and 021211 at @xmath284 seconds must be tied with the fireball dynamics .",
    "the fireball dynamics is determined by the ejecta initial energy and cbm density .",
    "a substantial energy injection can mitigate the afterglow dimming rate , however the energy deposition would have to last for the entire duration of the slower power - law decay , until at least a few days , and could lead to a too bright radio emission from the rs .",
    "besides energy injection , a sudden variation in the radial profile of the cbm could also alter the afterglow behaviour .",
    "such a variation is suggested by the association of grbs with the death of massive stars , which drive powerful winds , and that the modelling of multiwavelength afterglow measurements starting a few hours after the burst leads to better fits for a homogeneous medium than a wind .",
    "this discrepancy may be resolved if the afterglow does not arise in a freely expanding wind , but in the environment resulting from the interaction of the wind with the circumstellar gas ( wijers 2001 ) or with the winds blown by other stars ( scalo & wheeler 2001 ) .",
    "it is then possible that the grb ejecta run into a cbm whose density profile at smaller radii is the @xmath0 expected for a uniform , free wind , and closer to uniformity at larger distances .",
    "then , if the fs cooling frequency is above the optical domain , the optical afterglow light - curve index should decrease by @xmath285 when the wind termination shock is reached .",
    "the resulting index decrease is slightly smaller than observed , but it is possible that deviations from uniformity of the environment outside the unperturbed wind account for the difference .",
    "one important issue for this wind - bubble scenario is under what conditions the wind termination shock is located at the radius @xmath286 of the afterglow at the time @xmath287 when the light - curve transits from a steeper to a slower decay . from equations ( [ r2 ] ) and ( [ time ] ) , one obtains @xmath288 @xmath286 is higher by a factor of a few for the wind parameters @xmath289 which we find for this scenario , and by an extra factor @xmath290 for the high ejecta kinetic energy obtained for the afterglow 990123 .",
    "thus , we shall find that @xmath291 pc for the afterglow 990123 and @xmath292 pc for the afterglow 021211 . because the afterglow radius increases as @xmath179 at @xmath293 and because the slower decay of the afterglows 990123 and 021211 is seen from @xmath294 untill @xmath295 few days , the uniform part of the cbm must extend up to at least @xmath296 .",
    "castor , mccray & weaver ( 1975 ) have derived the major physical properties of a bubble resulting from the interaction of stellar winds with the interstellar gas , taking into account the cooling and the diffusion of the interstellar gas into the shocked wind .",
    "the radius of the wind termination shock @xmath297 can be estimated from the equality of the wind ram pressure and that inside the bubble , leading to @xmath298 pc , where @xmath299 is the mass - loss rate in @xmath300 , @xmath301 is the wind velocity in km / s , @xmath302 is the interstellar gas density in @xmath303 , and and @xmath304 is the duration of the wind measured in @xmath305 years . from here , the ratio of the contact discontinuity radius @xmath306 to that of the wind termination shock is @xmath307 .",
    "thus for a grb occurring in a dense cloud ( @xmath308 ) , the termination shock radius could be at location required by the cbm scenario ( equation [ rtrans ] ) and the shocked wind shell could be sufficiently thick .",
    "however , wr winds do not interact with the interstellar medium but with the wind expelled during the red supergiant ( rsg ) phase , which collides with the main - sequence phase wind decelerated by the interaction with the interstellar medium .",
    "the numerical hydrodynamical calculations of ramirez - ruiz ( 2001 ) take into account the wind history and show that @xmath309 pc for @xmath310 and @xmath311 years .",
    "such a termination shock radius is suitable for the wind - bubble scenario and the afterglow 021211 , however the wind - bubble size ( 0.3 pc ) shown by ramirez - ruiz ( 2001 ) is surprisingly small , being 100 times less than that expected from the analytical results of castor ( 1975 ) .",
    "chevalier ( 2004 ) have considered the possibility that a high interstellar pressure may stall the bubble expansion . for the external pressure expected in a intense starburst region ,",
    "their numerical simulations lead to a wind shock termination radius @xmath312 pc and a contact discontinuity located at @xmath313 , which is about right for the wind - bubble scenario and the afterglow 990123 .    alternatively",
    ", the uniformity of the cbm at @xmath293 required by the wind - bubble scenario might arise from a sudden increase in the wind speed , leading to a inner shock propagating into the incoming wind .",
    "the self - similar solutions derived by chevalier & imamura ( 1983 ) for colliding winds show that a thick , uniform density shell forms behind the inner shock if the termination shock moves at less than 1% of the unshocked wind speed , which requires the fluctuation in the wind to consist of a decrease in the mass - loss rate by a factor 100 and an increase of the wind speed increases by a factor 100 or larger .",
    "such a dramatic change in the wind properties exceeds that expected at the transition from a luminous blue variable ( lbv ) wind ( @xmath314 , @xmath315 ; garcia - segura , mac low , & langer 1996 ) or a rsg wind ( @xmath316 , @xmath317 ; garcia - segura , langer & mac low 1996 ) to a wolf - rayet wind ( @xmath318 , @xmath319 ) . the inner shock speed @xmath320 and the location of the termination shock required by the afterglows 990123 and 021211",
    "imply a wr lifetime @xmath321 and @xmath322 years , respectively , much shorter than predicted by evolutionary models for such stars .",
    "having found some support for the wind - bubble scenario in the stalled wr wind - bubble model of chevalier ( 2004 ) , and less so in the interaction between the rsg / lbv and wr winds , we proceed with testing it against the radio and optical observations of the afterglow 990123 and 021211 .",
    "the wind - bubble scenario must satisfy the constraints given in ",
    "[ rf ] , the first three pertaining to the emission from the fireball interacting with the homogeneous portion of the cbm , while the last three referring to the fs propagating in the @xmath0 bubble ( instead of the `` rs '' , as indicated in those equations ) .",
    "in addition , the constraint @xmath323 must be imposed , to explain the decrease of the afterglow dimming rate at @xmath287 , when the uniform medium is encountered .",
    "we note that , for @xmath32 , @xmath91 increases in time , while for @xmath30 it decreases .",
    "thus , if condition ( [ nuc ] ) is satisfied , then @xmath245 is above the optical domain for any @xmath324",
    ". we also note that this scenario has only four parameters , two ( @xmath26 and @xmath34 ) for the fs dynamics and two ( @xmath191 and @xmath109 ) for the emission .",

    "( [ rtrans ] ) , one obtains that this density is @xmath325 the density jump across the termination shock should lead to a brief brightening of the afterglow ( wijers 2001 ) . such a behaviour may have been missed in the afterglow 990123 , where there is a gap in the optical observations from 10 minutes to 4 hours .",
    "it is not seen in the optical measurements of the afterglow 021211 at the `` break '' time of 10 minutes determined by li ( 2003 ) , instead an optical emission brighter by 0.5 magnitudes than the double power - law fit used there is seen at 2 hours after the burst .",
    "the lack of a brightening at the right time in the afterglow 021211 may be problematic for the wind - bubble scenario considered here .",
    "figures [ janwb ] and [ decwb ] display separately the fs microphysical parameters which accommodate the observations before and after @xmath287 , for a few combinations of fireball energy @xmath26 and wind parameter @xmath34 .",
    "smaller values of the former parameter or larger values for the latter do not allow the fs to accommodate the @xmath326 radio and optical emission of the afterglows 990123 and 021211 .",
    "note that , because the rs emission has at least one free parameter ( @xmath40 and @xmath14 ) , requiring that it does not exceed the measured optical fluxes or the radio upper limits , does not constrain the fs parameters .",
    "as shown in figure [ janwb ] , the parameters @xmath191 and @xmath109 satisfying the observational constraints can not be constant across @xmath286 for the afterglow 990123 , with the electron energy parameter increasing by a factor @xmath327 and the magnetic field parameter decreasing by a factor @xmath327 when the fireball crosses the wind termination shock .",
    "a similar conclusion is reached for the afterglow 021211 ( figure [ decwb ] ) .",
    "we have investigated two scenarios that can account for the behavior of the early optical emission of grb afterglows 990123 and 021211 , whose light - curves fall - off as @xmath328 at @xmath329 seconds , while the decay at @xmath326 follows @xmath330 .",
    "the first scenario is the widely used reverse - forward shock scenario , where the fast decay of the early optical emission is attributed to the grb ejecta energized by the reverse shock ( rs ) , and the slower decaying phase is associated with circumburst medium ( cbm ) swept - up by the forward shock ( fs ) .",
    "figure [ jans0 ] shows that , for a homogeneous medium , the reverse - forward shock scenario can accommodate the radio and optical measurements of the afterglow 990123 if the ejecta magnetic field is @xmath290 times larger than in the shocked cbm , which implies an ejecta frozen - in magnetic field ( & rees 1997 , zhang 2003 ) , and if the rs parameter for the typical electron energy is @xmath290 times smaller than for the fs .",
    "this differences between the microphysical parameters behind the two shocks are too large to be explained away by the inaccuracies in the calculations of the afterglow emission presented in  [ radiation ] .    for a wind - like cbm ( figure [ jans2 ] ) , the reverse - forward shock scenario can explain the major properties of the radio and optical emissions of the afterglow 990123 with the same microphysical parameters behind both shocks ( figure [ jans2 ] ) , but it requires a wind density corresponding to a mass - loss rate to speed ratio less than @xmath331 ( @xmath332 ) .",
    "we obtain a similarly tenuous wind also from modelling the broadband data of the afterglow 990123 at @xmath333 days , but it should be noted that the best fit with a wind - like cbm provides a poorer fit to the data than a uniform medium .    within the framework of the reverse - forward shock scenario ,",
    "the same microphysical parameters are obtained for the afterglow 021211 , for a thick ejecta shell and either a uniform or a wind - like cbm ( the latter case is shown in figure [ decs2 ] ) . for a uniform cbm",
    ", we obtain @xmath334 , larger than the @xmath335 inferred by us ( kumar & panaitescu 2003 ) for a thin ejecta shell . for a wind - like cbm",
    ", the afterglow 021211 requires a wind density corresponding to a mass - loss rate to speed ratio below @xmath331 , a result similar to that obtained for the afterglow 990123 .    the second scenario considered in this work (  [ bb ] ) , that of wind - bubble having a inner @xmath0 wind - like region surrounded by a zone of uniform density , is motivated by that the decrease in the dimming rate of the optical afterglows 990123 and 021211 seen at @xmath336 seconds matches fairly well the expectations for such a density profile .",
    "the required cbm structure finds support in the scenario of wr wind - bubbles stalled by a high interstellar pressure discussed by chevalier ( 2004 ) . for this scenario to explain the general properties of the radio and optical emissions of the afterglows 990123 and 021211",
    ", the magnetic field and electron energy parameters would have to decrease and increase , respectively , by a factor of about 100 at @xmath337 , when the wind termination shock is reached ( figures [ janwb ] and [ decwb ] ) , a contrived feature without a physical foundation .",
    "we also find that the wind - bubble scenario requires winds which are as tenuous as those for the reverse - forward shock scenario .",
    "thus the reverse - forward shock scenario provides a more natural explanation than the wind - bubble scenario for the steep early decay of the optical emission of the afterglows 990123 and 021211 .",
    "given that the grb ejecta can be initially magnetized and that the rs is less relativistic than the fs , the microphysical parameters might differ behind the two shocks .",
    "if their equality is required for a simpler scenario , with fewer assumptions , then a wind - like cbm is favoured by the reverse - forward shock scenario , though a problem still exists : the low wind density inferred in each case ( @xmath332 ) , which is similar to that derived by chevalier ( 2004 ) for the afterglows 020405 and 021211 and by price ( 2002 ) for the afterglow 011211 . in the sample of 64 galactic wr stars analyzed by nugis & lamers ( 2000 )",
    "there is only one star with @xmath332 , the majority of the other stars having a mass - loss rate @xmath338 , a wind velocity @xmath339 , and @xmath340 .",
    "the dependence of the mass - loss rate on stellar mass and metallicity inferred by nugis & lamers ( 2000 ) lead to @xmath341 for wn stars and @xmath342 for wcs , which may suggest that the tenuous winds required by the reverse - forward shock scenario for the afterglows 990123 and 021211 arise wr stars which are less massive and less metal rich than galactic wrs ( wijers 2001 , chevalier 2004 ) . if such stars do not exist , then either the microphysical parameters must be different behind the rs crossing the grb ejecta and the fs sweeping - up the cbm or the fast declining early optical emission of the afterglows 990123 and 021211 is not arising in the rs .",

    "<S> the optical light - curves of grb afterglows 990123 and 021211 exhibit a steep decay at 100600 seconds after the burst , the decay becoming slower after about 10 minutes . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate two scenarios for the fast decaying early optical emission of these grb afterglows . in the _ reverse - forward shock _ </S>",
    "<S> scenario , this emission arises in the reverse shock crossing the grb ejecta , the mitigation of the light - curve decay occurring when the forward shock emission overtakes that from the reverse shock . </S>",
    "<S> both a homogeneous and wind - like circumburst medium are considered . in the _ wind - bubble _ scenario , </S>",
    "<S> the steeply decaying , early optical emission arises from the forward shock interacting with a @xmath0 bubble , with a negligible contribution from the reverse shock , the slower decay starting when the blast wave reaches the bubble termination shock and enters a homogeneous region of the circumburst medium .    </S>",
    "<S> we determine the shock microphysical parameters , ejecta kinetic energy , and circumburst density which accommodate the radio and optical measurements of the grb afterglows 990123 and 021211 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , for a homogeneous medium , the radio and optical emissions of the afterglow 990123 can be accommodated by the reverse - forward shock scenario if the microphysical parameters behind the two shocks differ substantially . </S>",
    "<S> a wind - like circumburst medium also allows the reverse - forward shocks scenario to account for the radio and optical properties of the afterglows 990123 and 021211 , but the required wind densities are at least 10 times smaller than those of galactic wolf - rayet stars . </S>",
    "<S> the wind - bubble scenario requires a variation of the microphysical parameters when the afterglow fireball reaches the wind termination shock , which seems a contrived feature .    </S>"
