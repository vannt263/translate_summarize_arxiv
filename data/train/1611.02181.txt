    "the field of social dynamics is concerned primarily with interactions among individuals and the resulting group behaviors .",
    "research in social dynamics models the temporal evolution of social systems via the interactions of the individuals within these systems @xcite .",
    "for example , opinion dynamics can model the opinion state transitions of an entire population in an election scenario @xcite , and epidemic dynamics can predict disease outbreaks ahead of time @xcite .",
    "while traditional social - dynamics models focus primarily on the macroscopic effects of social systems , often we instead wish to know the answers to more specific questions . given the movement and behavior history of a subject with ebola , can we tell how many people should be tested or quarantined ?",
    "city - size quarantine is not necessary , but family - size quarantine is insufficient .",
    "we aim to model a method to evaluate the paths of illness transmission and the risks of infection for _ individuals _ , so that limited medical resources can be most efficiently distributed .",
    "the rapid growth of both social networks and sensor networks offers an unprecedented opportunity to collect abundant data at the individual level . from these data we can extract temporal interactions among individuals , such as meeting or taking the same class . to take advantage of this opportunity",
    ", we model social dynamics from an individual perspective .",
    "although such an approach has considerable potential , in practice it is difficult to model the dynamic interactions and handle the costly computations when a large number of individuals are involved . in this paper , we introduce an event - based model into social systems to characterize their temporal evolutions and make tractable inferences on the individual level .",
    "our research on the temporal evolutions of social systems is related to dynamic bayesian networks and continuous time bayesian networks @xcite .",
    "traditionally , a coupled hidden markov model is used to capture the interactions of components in a system @xcite , but this model does not consider dynamic interactions .",
    "however , a stochastic kinetic model is capable of successfully describing the interactions of molecules ( such as collisions ) in chemical reactions @xcite , and is widely used in many fields such as chemistry and cell biology @xcite .",
    "we introduce this model into social dynamics and use it to focus on individual behaviors .",
    "a challenge in capturing the interactions of individuals is that in social dynamics the state space grows exponentially with the number of individuals , which makes exact inference intractable . to resolve this",
    "we must apply approximate inference methods .",
    "one class of these involves sampling - based methods . rao and teh",
    "introduce a gibbs sampler based on local updates @xcite , while murphy and russell introduce rao - blackwellized particle filtering for dynamic bayesian networks @xcite .",
    "however , sampling - based methods sometimes mix slowly and require a large number of samples / particles . to demonstrate this issue , we offer empirical comparisons with two major sampling methods in section [ sec : experiments ] .",
    "an alternative class of approximations is based on variational inference .",
    "opper and sanguinetti apply the variational mean field approach to factor a markov jump process @xcite , and cohn and el - hay further improve its efficiency by exploiting the structure of the target network @xcite .",
    "a problem is that in an event - based model such as a stochastic kinetic model ( skm ) , the variational mean field is not applicable when a single event changes the states of two individuals simultaneously . here",
    ", we use a general expectation propagation principle @xcite to design our algorithm .",
    "this paper makes three contributions : first , we introduce the discrete event model into social dynamics and make tractable inferences on both individual behaviors and collective effects . to this end",
    ", we apply the stochastic kinetic model to define adaptive transition probabilities that characterize the dynamic interaction patterns in social systems .",
    "second , we design an efficient variational inference algorithm whose computation complexity grows linearly with the number of individuals . as a result , it scales very well in large social systems .",
    "third , we conduct experiments on epidemic dynamics to demonstrate that our algorithm can track the transmission of epidemics and predict the probability of infection for each individual .",
    "further , we demonstrate that the proposed method is more efficient than sampling while nonetheless achieving high accuracy .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we briefly review the coupled hidden markov model and the stochastic kinetic model . in section 3 , we propose applying a variational algorithm with the stochastic kinetic model to make tractable inferences in social dynamics . in section 4 , we detail empirical results from applying the proposed algorithm to our epidemic data along with the proximity data collected from sensor networks .",

    "[ chmmvsskm ]      a stochastic kinetic model describes the temporal evolution of a chemical system with @xmath11 species @xmath18 driven by @xmath19 events ( or chemical reactions ) parameterized by rate constants @xmath20 .",

    ", an infection event @xmath35 has the form @xmath36 , such that a susceptible individual ( @xmath37 ) is infected by an infectious individual ( @xmath38 ) with rate constant @xmath39 . if there is only one susceptible individual ( type @xmath40 ) and one infectious individual ( type @xmath41 ) involved in this event , @xmath42 , @xmath43^{t}$ ] and @xmath44 .    in a traditional hidden markov model , the transition kernel",
    "is typically fixed . in comparison , skm is better at capturing dynamic interactions in terms of the events with rates dependent on reactant populations , as shown in eq.([eq : rate ] ) .",
    "in this section , we define the likelihood of the entire sequence of hidden states and observations for an event - based model , and derive a variational inference algorithm and parameter - learning algorithm .      in social dynamics , we use a discrete time markov model to describe the temporal evolutions of a set of individuals @xmath45 according to a set of @xmath19 events . to cope with dynamic interactions ,",
    "we introduce the skm and express the state transition probabilities in terms of event probabilities , as shown in figure [ chmmvsskm](b ) .",

    "the synthetic data set was collected on the dartmouth college campus from april 2001 to june 2004 , and contains the movement history of 13,888 individuals @xcite .",
    "we synthesized disease transmission along a timeline using the popular susceptible - infectious - susceptible ( sis ) epidemiology model @xcite , then applied the viskm to calibrate performance .",
