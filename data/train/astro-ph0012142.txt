    "the most fundamental characterization of star formation is the slope of the initial mass function ( imf ) ; it is a crucial parameter in our theoretical understanding of astrophysical topics from star formation @xcite to galaxy evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in a common notation , @xmath2 is the index of the power law used to define the imf ( i.e. , the slope in the log - log plot of number versus mass distribution ) .",
    "this parameter is usually assumed to be universally near the @xcite value ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "however , evidence now suggests that the imf depends strongly on some properties of the star formation environment . @xcite and",
    "@xcite identify a significant _ field _ component of massive stars in the clouds .",
    "massey  et  al . found an extremely steep field imf ( @xmath4 ) , but this result depended upon a large incompleteness correction determined from two small areas ( the incompleteness correction was significant for the fainter , typically lower mass stars , with likely minimal effect for the high mass stars ; for this reason , their imf results heavily depend on the highest mass bins ) .",
    "parker  et  al . found a flatter imf , but relied purely upon ultraviolet ( uv ) photometry rather than optical spectra to determine temperatures , bolometric corrections , and hence masses .",
    "a spectroscopic study of the magellanic cloud field stars is now underway to address the discrepant results for the imf .    a physical framework that may explain many aspects of the observed imf is provided by random sampling of fractal clouds , which naturally produces a salpeter imf for all sizes of clouds @xcite .",
    "according to that model , in well - sampled regions formed from large clouds ( such as ob associations ) , one would measure a salpeter imf . however",
    ", field regions could display a steeper observed imf due to : a superposition of undersampled salpeter imfs from many star - forming clouds with a large range of sizes , differential drift as a function of mass , or lower local ism and cloud pressure allowing more efficient cloud disruption .",
    "in particular , as described by @xcite , if the higher mass stars can sometimes destroy clouds and halt further local star formation , then even if all clouds sample the salpeter imf , low mass clouds will make primarily low mass stars , and high mass clouds will make low and high mass stars .",
    "if there are many more low mass clouds than high mass clouds ( such as may be the case in the distant field regions ) , then the composite imf from all these clouds will be measured to have a slope steeper than the salpeter slope , i.e. , have proportionately more lower mass stars because of the preponderance of low mass clouds .",
    "@xcite find that the general field pressure in dwarf irregular galaxies is roughly an order of magnitude lower than the pressure in the hii regions , unlike the case in spiral galaxies where the two pressures are roughly equal .",
    "this difference could explain why the imf in the lmc field could be relatively steep , whereas the imf in the galactic field and in galactic and lmc ob associations could be similar to the salpeter imf .",
    "@xcite note that their analysis of the @xcite data implies a steep imf slope for galactic field stars , which would contradict the theoretical model , but they also point out the data may be strongly biased by selection effects .",
    "much of the uncertainty in the field star imf may be due to our lack of knowledge of the population of massive ob - type stars in the field . in an analysis of the n  11 region in the northwest lmc , @xcite discuss the o - type star content in the ob associations and in the nearby field regions .",
    "they used uv photometry from the _ ultraviolet imaging telescope _",
    "( _ uit _ ) for the full region and environs ; @xmath5 photometry for the ob associations lh  9 , 10 , and 13 ( but not for the field stars ) was available in the literature for multi - wavelength analysis . from the combination of uv and optical ground - based photometry they identified 88 candidate o - type stars ( cots ) in the lh  9 , 10 , and 13 fields ( in a total area of @xmath6  arcmin@xmath7 ) and as many as 170 to 240 such stars in the entire 37  arcmin - diameter field - of - view . however , this estimate for the population of cots depended solely on uv data in a single filter , requiring various assumptions for the o and b star fraction in the field and the range of reddening .    in this paper ,",
    "we take the next step in determining the population of massive ob - type stars throughout the clouds and understanding the imf in the field and associations .",
    "we analyze the cots population for another lmc region , but this time using both uv and optical data not only for stars in ob associations , but for field stars as well .",
    "although we can not yet determine the imf for the field stars due to lack of spectroscopic classifications of the cots ( a project that , as mentioned above , is currently underway ) , we do have spectra for the blue stars in one of the ob associations in the region , and so we analyze the imf for that association . in section  [ sec",
    ": data ] we discuss the region observed and the various datasets used in this study . in section  [ sec : comps ] , we make cross - comparisons between three optical datasets : the magellanic cloud photometric survey ( mcps ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the catalog of @xcite , and heretofore unpublished photometry .",
    "we analyze these datasets in a consistent manner and compare the resulting imfs for the ob association to better understand the potential differences that may arise in imf studies . in section  [ sec : uv ]",
    "we combine the uv and optical datasets to calculate temperatures of the stars and to analyze the population of hot stars throughout the region , and better determine the distribution of cots in the field , far from currently known ob associations .",
    "figure  [ fig : uit_dss]a shows the _ uit _  image used in this analysis , and figure  [ fig : uit_dss]b shows the corresponding image from the digitized sky survey with various ob associations , clusters , and ground - based ccd fields identified .",
    "the _ uit _  field covers parts of n  79 and n  94 , all of n  81 , n  83 , and a number of smaller regions .",
    "the identification of these regions ( lha  120-n  79 , 81 , 83 , 94 ) was originally defined by @xcite in his catalog of h@xmath8-emission stars and nebulae .",
    "the extent of those regions are also shown in the lmc atlas by @xcite , and are outlined in figure  [ fig : uit_dss ] . some lucke - hodge ( lh ; * ? ? ? * ) regions are also identified in figure  [ fig : uit_dss]b .",
    "n  79 is an irregular region in the southwest part of the _ uit _  image .",
    "it is roughly @xmath9  arcmin in size , and encloses the regions ngc  1712 ( lh  1 , which is just within the edge of the _ uit _  image ) , 1722 , and 1727 ( lh  2 ) .",
    "n  83 near the center of the region is about 5  arcmin in diameter , and contains the ob association lh  5 , which is comprised of ngc  1737 , 1743 , 1745 , and 1748 . to the southeast ,",
    "n  94 is identified as lh  8 , and encloses ngc  1767 .",
    "the details of the _ uit _  catalog ( instrument , observations , and data reduction ) are fully discussed by @xcite and @xcite . during the spacelab astro-2 mission which flew aboard the space shuttle endeavour on 1995 march 2 - 18 , _ uit _  obtained more than 700 ultraviolet images of nearly 200 celestial targets .",
    "the images include 16 fields in the lmc and three fields in the smc @xcite .",
    "the _ uit _  observations of the field in figure  [ fig : uit_dss ] , designated as `` n  79 '' in the catalog of @xcite , were made on 1995 march 14 , and consist of two exposures ( 65  sec , 653  sec ) in the b5 filter , which has a centroid wavelength of @xmath10   , and a bandwidth of @xmath11    [ see @xcite for the filter response curve ] .",
    "the @xmath1237  arcmin diameter photographic images were scanned and digitized with a pds 1010 m microdensitometer , resulting in images with 1.13  arcsec pixels and point - source profiles with fwhm@xmath13 arcsec .",
    "calibrations were made in the same manner as for astro-1 @xcite , based on laboratory measurements and data obtained during the missions .",
    "flux value zeropoints were derived primarily with comparisons to _ iue _ stars , but also with comparisons to stars observed by _ oao-2 _ , _ hut _ , _ ans _ , _ ghrs _ , and other uv - capable instruments .",
    "uv magnitudes are defined from these fluxes as : @xmath14 astrometry was performed with reference to _ hst _ guide stars @xcite .",
    "stellar photometry on the _ uit _",
    "images was performed with idl procedures based on the daophot algorithms @xcite .",
    "aperture corrections were calculated for each image , and small corrections were made in the zeropoint offsets so that the median difference of the flux for all stars was zero between the two images ( putting both images on the same zeropoint ) .",
    "the final magnitude for each star is the average of its measurements on the two images weighted by the inverse square of its calculated photometric errors . a comparison with _ iue _ observations of three relatively uncrowded stars in the field show that the _ uit _  and _ iue _ fluxes agree to better than 5% .",
    "the completeness limits of the ground - based data used in this paper go to slightly later spectral types , so the combined _ uit _  and ground - based dataset is limited by the uv data .",
    "figure  [ fig : lf_uit ] shows the histogram of observed uv magnitudes for the 3533 stars detected in the _ uit _  images of this field .",
    "the limiting magnitude is @xmath15  mag , the magnitude of an unreddened late b - type ( @xmath12  b9 ) star .",
    "the completeness limit , the magnitude to which we should have detected all stars , is @xmath16  mag , the magnitude of an unreddened early b - type ( @xmath12  b3 ) star .",
    "the mcps catalog is discussed by @xcite .",
    "the data originate from @xmath17 drift - scan imaging on the las campanas swope ( 1  m ) telescope with the great circle camera @xcite and a 2048@xmath182048 pixel ccd with pixel scale of 0.7  arcsec  pixel@xmath19 .",
    "typical seeing is @xmath121.5  arcsec .",
    "the data reduction and uncertainties are described in the original paper .",
    "the survey is still progressing , so the data presented here are drawn from a preliminary catalog of a small region of the lmc , and for that reason , we do not publish the mcps data here .",
    "( the _ uit _  catalog is already publically available . )",
    "the mcps data for this and other regions will be made public when reductions of nearby regions are complete , and may be superior only in that the overlapping areas between all scans will enable checks and possible corrections to the photometry .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig : uit_dss]b , the currently available scan region does not cover the entire _ uit _  field , so for our uv+optical analysis we can use only this region of overlap .",
    "the full scan of this region , obtained in 1997 december , is 124@xmath1825 arcmin@xmath20 , resulting in a catalog of 265,794 stars ; 80,733 stars are in the region that overlaps with the _ uit _  image .",
    "the area of this overlapping region is @xmath12675  arcmin@xmath20 , or 1.4  pc@xmath20 .    [",
    "cols=\">,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the mcps data have the advantage that they cover sufficient area to allow correction for contamination of background stars ( i.e. , lmc field stars ) in the area of lh  2 .",
    "we selected two large fields ( indicated by the dashed - lined boxes in figure  [ fig : uit_dss]b ) by eye to serve as background fields .",
    "stars in these fields were run through the same calculations to determine imf masses .",
    "the number of stars in each mass bin was scaled by the relative sizes of the lh  2 and the background fields , and then was subtracted from the imf plotted in figure  [ fig : imfs]c .",
    "the resulting field star corrected imf is shown in figure  [ fig : imfs]d .",
    "this imf is notably flatter than the uncorrected imf .",
    "the fact that field stars can affect the observed imf is not a new idea , but it is a correction that is often not made , possibly because most observations do not cover a large enough area to make the measurement and correction and it is assumed that there are not many or sufficient ob - type field stars to bias the sample .",
    "our result simply emphasizes the fact that this correction _ is _ important even for ob - type stars , and , if the imf slope is constant and universal , such field contamination could possibly even be a major factor causing the wide range of observed imf slopes .",
    "the _ uit _  data were combined with the mcps data using all mcps stars within the field - of - view of the _ uit _  image , which contains 80733 stars from the mcps catalog and 3533 stars in the _ uit _  catalog .",
    "because the mcps data do not extend across the entire declination range of the _ uit _  field ( see figure  [ fig : uit_dss]b ) , we will only use the overlapping sub - region for our analysis in this paper . in that region , there are 2770 mcps stars that have uv photometry from the _ uit _  catalog .",
    "these stars were matched by positional coincidence with a 3  arcsec tolerance .    to compare our photometry to @xcite models",
    ", we use uv and optical magnitudes derived from filter functions convolved with kurucz spectra .",
    "the uv magnitudes were derived by landsman ( personal communication ) by convolving kurucz spectra with the _ uit _  response curve .",
    "optical / ir standard broad band colors and magnitudes for the kurucz models were calculated by @xcite ; however , those data were determined for solar abundances . from those authors we obtained their data for models with",
    "@xmath21=-0.5 $ ] , more appropriate for lmc metallicity @xcite .",
    "the observed magnitudes were compared to the synthetic photometry of the models to determine the best matching model (  and surface gravity ) using a number of different programs and best - fit estimators . in table  [ tab : spec ] we show the results of some of these fits for those stars that have spectroscopic observations , and therefore , good estimates of their true . in one case ( the `` phot@xmath22 '' columns ) , we first calculated the @xmath23 for each star using the @xmath24 index as determined from the @xmath5 photometry ( table  [ tab : q ] ) , dereddened the observed colors , then performed the fit of the data to the models . in another case ( the `` phot '' columns ) we allowed @xmath23 to be a free parameter in the fit . for comparison , in the `` spec '' columns , we also show the @xmath23 calculated from the observed @xmath25 color and the intrinsic @xmath26 color based on the color  vs.  spectral type calibration . in all cases , for the reddening law",
    "we use the functional form of @xcite with the `` average lmc '' coefficients derived by @xcite , and fits were weighted using the daophot - derived photometric errors .",
    "( in many cases for the cots , the @xmath27 data were saturated , which is reflected in the quoted errors . )    in nearly all cases , the  calculated in the fit underestimates the `` true ''  as determined from calibration with spectral type @xcite , though about half have reasonably good fits ( i.e. , the difference in  is @xmath28  dex ) . in the `` match ''",
    "column of table  [ tab : spec ] we show the @xmath23 that would be required to get the fitted  to match the spectroscopic .",
    "if the calculated @xmath24 is too red , the resulting @xmath23 and  values will also be too low .",
    "if we adjust the mcps data by the value of @xmath29 shown in table  [ tab : q ] , the fitted  values are significantly improved , but still too low on average .",
    "it is probably the case that this systematically too - low  is not only a factor of an incorrectly derived reddening , but possibly also due to a model calibration error ; the fits are most sensitive to the uv  optical colors , which involve two different photometric systems that may not be well cross - calibrated .",
    "however , we should point out that if we use only the optical data to calculate @xmath23 and/or perform the fit , the fitted  values even further underestimate the true temperatures in most cases , so the addition of the uv data , while not a sufficient replacement for getting spectral types , definitely improves our estimate of  for o - type stars .",
    "so although the inclusion of the uv data does not allow us to definitively identify the o - type stars and determine their , it allows us to establish a better lower limit to the number of o - type stars in the catalog than optical data would alone . to determine a reliable correction factor",
    "we are in the process of performing larger - scale study of magellanic cloud stars with spectra and uv+optical photometry to study this effect , which could be due to many factors including errors or uncertainties in : systematic photometry errors ( see table  [ tab : q ] ) ; applying a galactic  vs.  spectral type calibration to lmc stars ; the kurucz models for lmc metallicity ; the convolution of the filter function with the models to obtain colors on the standard system ; and/or the fitting method used to find the best match of the model colors to the data .",
    "it is also possible that the uncertainty may not be correctable with this kind of data : although one may optimize the the calibration for blue stars , the  for o - type stars can increase significantly without any real , notable change in the observable color .",
    "this is an asymmetric effect , i.e. , a _",
    "large increase _ in  is harder to detect via optical ( and even uv ) colors than a _ relatively smaller decrease _ in .",
    "this would imply that , on average , any calibration of  vs.  photometric color will tend to underestimate the temperatures for o - type stars .",
    "see also the discussion by @xcite on how this asymmetry can affect the slope of the imf . ]",
    "we then performed these fits to all 2770 stars in our dataset that have uv and optical data , and the temperature distribution is shown in figure  [ fig : teff_dist ] .",
    "the qualitative shape of the distribution is roughly as expected : it rises up quickly at low  ( due to incompleteness and observational bias against the fainter , cooler stars ) , then the numbers steadily decrease going to higher , reflective of the imf .",
    "there are two unusual features : a plateau ( and small spike ) between 26,000 and 30,000  k , and a spike at  = 50,000  k. it is unclear if these are artifacts of the fit or real features .",
    "for example , the spike at 50,000  k could be because that is the maximum  in the models , so all hotter stars are put into that bin . also , another point of concern is that we find a slight trend of hotter stars having larger @xmath23 values on average ( although there is a large scatter ; stars of all temperatures do show a wide range of reddenings ) . since the reddening is a variable in the fit ,",
    "if the reddening is overestimated for a star , then the  may be overestimated .",
    "however , a similar though less steep trend is seen if one compares the @xmath23 derived purely from the @xmath5 photometry via the @xmath24 index .",
    "so this trend may be real , and may reflect the situation that the hottest , most massive stars also are the shortest - lived , and therefore are more likely to still be in or near their birth regions , which will have larger than average extinction .",
    "in fact , the @xmath24-derived @xmath23 values tend to be larger on average than the fitted values ( contrary to the trend seen with the few stars in table  [ tab : spec ] ) ; if the reddening values are , indeed , larger than the fitted values , then our  estimates may be too low , and there may be more stars with higher temperatures than shown in figure  [ fig : teff_dist ] .      taking our results at face value , there are 322 stars with @xmath30  k , the typical temperature of the latest o - type star .",
    "we note that the comparison in table  [ tab : spec ] and the previous discussion about the reddening imply that our fits may tend to underestimate the true temperatures . in table",
    "[ tab : spec ] , o - type stars have fitted temperatures as low as @xmath1220,000  k. we find 1820 stars with fitted @xmath31  k. given that the area of the dataset is @xmath121.4  pc@xmath20 , these numbers translate to a density of one o - type star per @xmath1280430  pc@xmath20 ( 0.42.1  arcmin@xmath20 ) . for comparison ,",
    "the density in the solar neighborhood is less one o - type star per 40,000  pc@xmath20 @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : teff30k ] shows the spatial distribution of the stars with @xmath32  k in the region we analyzed .",
    "note the large number of cots well - distributed outside of the boundaries of the classical ob associations : about 200 of the hot stars , nearly two - thirds of the cots , are outside the boundaries of the `` n '' and `` lh '' regions shown in figure  [ fig : teff30k ] .",
    "how many of these may be true field stars ?",
    "@xcite define `` field stars '' as those that are farther from the boundary of any ob association than the distance an o - type star could travel in its lifetime ( 10  myr for late - type o stars ) at a typical dispersion velocity of @xmath33  km  s@xmath19 relative to the parent molecular cloud .",
    "this distance is about 30  pc , or 2  arcmin at the distance of the lmc .",
    "this is a reasonable definition for most cases .",
    "if we count only those stars beyond @xmath122  arcmin from any of the boundaries , that still leaves about 160 stars .",
    "_ approximately equal numbers of cots are found in the field and in ob associations .",
    "_ this result is in accord with earlier suggestions from the galactic study of @xcite ; their figure  2 shows that perhaps the majority of the o stars within 3  kpc of the sun are not in ob associations .",
    "our result can be extrapolated to the general distribution of massive stars in the lmc only if one assumes that the region studied here is large enough to provide a representative and proportional sample of field and association areas .",
    "the density of `` field '' ob stars in this region is roughly one star per 700  pc@xmath20 ( 3.5  arcmin@xmath20 ) .    because of the uncertainties in obtaining  from photometry alone",
    ", these estimates will have to be verified with spectroscopic observations .",
    "it is unclear if our estimates of the o - type star population may be high or low : some of these cots will turn out to be later - type stars because we have over - estimated their , but it is perhaps even more likely that there were many o - type stars that were missed because we under - estimated their  ( e.g. , as in table  [ tab : spec ] , many o - type stars were fitted @xmath34  k ) .",
    "also , because we have only considered those stars with both uv and optical photometry , some o - type stars may have been missed in our analysis because they were too heavily obscured to be detected in the uv , and this may be a stronger effect in the younger star forming regions where extinction is higher . in light of these uncertainties ,",
    "our analysis has been reasonably conservative , and we conclude that our results provide a lower limit to the total population of o - type stars in the field .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed the uv photometric data from _ uit _  along with the optical ( @xmath17 ) data from the magellanic cloud photometric survey and other ground - based sources to study the stellar content within and near n  79 in the southwest region of the lmc .",
    "our analysis of these data gives the following results :    * comparisons of three different optical datasets for the lh  2 ob association show that although the datasets exhibit median photometric differences of up to 30% , the resulting observed , uncorrected imfs are reasonably similar , typically @xmath0 in the 560  mass range .",
    "* when we correct for the background contribution of field stars in the one dataset where this is possible , the calculated imf flattens to @xmath35 ( similar to the salpeter imf slope ) .",
    "this implies that the background contribution of stars  even for massive stars",
    " may be an important factor to the range of imf slopes found in the literature .",
    "* fitting the uv+optical data to kurucz models , we find 322 stars with fitted @xmath32  k ( the lower limit for  for a typical , latest type o star ) , and 1820 stars with fitted @xmath31  k ( the lower limit for the fitted  for known o - type stars used for comparison in table  [ tab : spec ] ) . * we find evidence that the number of candidate o - type `` field '' stars is roughly equal to the number of such stars in ob associations .",
    "this distribution is very interesting in that it provides strong confirmation of the conventional wisdom ; see @xcite .",
    "this work shows the potential of the large - scale analysis of stellar populations that will be possible when the mcps is complete and combined with the _ uit _  dataset .",
    "the results of this and similar studies are leading us to make more detailed observations of the massive star content of the field region in both magellanic clouds to better understand the origin of these stars and their imf .",
    "we are presently conducting spectroscopic observations and further analysis to determine if these are true isolated field stars , not born in ob associations , or if they are high - velocity runaways or members of many previously unrecognized , low - density ob associations .",
    "we will also include field regions of the lmc and smc that are notably less active in present star formation ( e.g. , farther from or containing fewer and smaller ob associations ) to see if our results here are representative of the global distribution of massive stars .",
    "ultimately , these data will allow us to resolve discrepant measurements of the field star imf and the origins of massive stars .",
    "if there is a significant population of massive field stars that have formed in situ as isolated events , it will have important implications on concepts and models of star formation .",
