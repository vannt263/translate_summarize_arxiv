    "in recent years there has been an increasing interest in the question of joint measurability of noncommuting quantum observables , both from a foundational @xcite and quantum information theoretical @xcite perspective .",
    "the connection of this issue with certain impossible tasks in quantum mechanics , such as universal copier and bell s telephone , is lucidly explained in @xcite .",
    "since two observables represented as selfadjoint operators do not have a joint observable if they do not commute , it is necessary in such cases to understand joint measurability in a wider sense .",
    "as intuitively understood by heisenberg already in 1927 @xcite , one has to allow for a degree of imprecision in order to make room for a notion of joint measurement of noncommuting observables .",
    "this idea can be appropriately investigated if the wider class of observables represented as positive operator measures ( poms ) is taken into consideration .",
    "projection valued measures among the poms correspond to the standard observables represented as selfadjoint operators ; they are called _",
    "sharp observables_.    in the class of poms , there are pairs of noncommuting observables that possess a joint observable , which thus has these two observables as its marginals .",
    "commutativity is necessary for joint measurability if at least one of the poms is a sharp observable , but generally commutativity is not required .",
    "a joint measurement of two poms @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be regarded as an _ approximate joint measurement _ of two noncommuting observables @xmath2 and @xmath3 if @xmath4 are close ( in some suitable sense ) to @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "the problem of approximate joint measurements of position and momentum has been treated comprehensively in related publications @xcite .",
    "the case of observables with discrete spectra requires somewhat different concepts and will be treated in the present paper for the case of joint measurements of qubit observables .",
    "we will introduce an appropriate measure of the quality of the approximation of one observable by another observable .",
    "it will then be shown that the quality of approximations in an approximate joint measurement of two sharp observables is limited if these observables do not commute .",
    "this limitation can indeed be formulated rigorously as a form of heisenberg uncertainty relation .",
    "one factor limiting the accuracy in an approximate joint measurement of noncommuting sharp observables is the fact that the approximating marginal observables must have a sufficient degree of _ intrinsic unsharpness _ as a consequence of their joint measurability . hence there is yet another form of heisenberg uncertainty relation for appropriately defined degrees of unsharpness in joint measurements . the distinction between the relational feature of inaccuracy ( distance between two poms ) and the intrinsic property of unsharpness ( of an individual pom ) was until now blurred due to the fact that joint measurements were considered in which the marginals were coarse - grained versions of the sharp observables to be approximated ; in such cases the intrinsic unsharpness and the inaccuracy are interconnected .",
    "a theory and first models of approximate joint measurements of qubit observables were presented for special cases in @xcite . in those works and all subsequent developments , only a restricted class of joint measurements was used to approximate two sharp spin components . here",
    "this restriction will be lifted , thereby allowing one to determine optimal joint measurements and to formulate uncertainty relations that can be used to characterize the optimal cases .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec :",
    "simple ] we review the condition of joint measurability of two simple observables ( i.e. observables representing yes - no measurements ) , and give a precise definition of the approximate joint measurability of two observables .",
    "these conditions and concepts are investigated in sections  [ sec : qubit]-[sec : approx - joint ] in the case of qubit observables .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusion ] gives our conclusions and an outlook .",
    "the general definition of an observable @xmath2 as a positive operator measure ( pom ) reduces , in the case of measurements with finitely many outcomes @xmath6 , to the specification of a map @xmath7 , where the @xmath8 are _ effects _ , that is , positive operators satisfying the ordering relation for two selfadjoint operators @xmath9 and @xmath10 means that @xmath11 for every vector @xmath12 . ]",
    "( here @xmath14 are the null and unit operators , respectively . ) together with any state ( density operator ) @xmath15 , @xmath2 determines a probability distribution over the outcomes of @xmath2 via the trace formula , @xmath16 $ ] .",
    "the additivity and normalization of probability distributions is ensured by the condition @xmath17 .",
    "a _ simple observable _ is one that represents a measurement with two possible outcomes ; it is given as a pom with two values and associated effects , @xmath18 normalization entails that @xmath19 , so that a simple observable is commutative .",
    "we note that any effect @xmath9 together with its complement effect @xmath20 defines a class of simple observables , distinguished only by their outcome sets @xmath21 .",
    "as noted in the introduction , an observable ( pom ) is _ sharp _ if its effects are all projections .",
    "otherwise an observable is called _",
    "unsharp_. a measure of the intrinsic unsharpness of an effect @xmath9 and thus of the associated simple observable @xmath2 that is independent of the outcomes of @xmath2 is obtained as follows .",
    "let @xmath22 denote the spectrum of an effect @xmath9 , then the _ spectral width _ of @xmath9 is the length of the smallest closed interval containing @xmath22 , that is : @xmath23 .",
    "the _ sharpness _ of @xmath9 is defined as @xmath24 the operator @xmath25 can be written as @xmath26 .",
    "this shows that @xmath25 arises from the sequential lders measurement of the complement effects @xmath9 and @xmath27 , and this is a motivation for the formula ( [ eqn : sharpness - def ] ) ; see @xcite for further discussion .    since @xmath28",

    "the _ sharpness _ and _ unsharpness _ of a simple observable @xmath2 may now be defined as @xmath35      two observables are jointly measurable if there is a measurement scheme that allows the determination of the values of both observables .",
    "this means that the pom representing that joint measurement contains the two observables as marginals . in this way it is ensured that there is a joint probability distribution for each state .",
    "we spell out this definition for the case of a pair of simple observables .",
    "two simple observables @xmath0 and @xmath1 are _ jointly measurable _ if there is an observable @xmath36 , @xmath37 , such that @xmath38 in this case the observables @xmath0 and @xmath1 are the _ marginals _ of @xmath39 , and we also say that @xmath39 is a _ joint observable _ for @xmath0 and @xmath1 . the outcomes @xmath40 of @xmath39 could be taken to be ( or replaced by ) the pairs @xmath41 .",
    "the joint measurability of two simple observables @xmath0 and @xmath1 is equivalent to the statement @xcite that there exists an operator @xmath42 satisfying the following set of operator inequalities : @xmath43 in fact , these inequalities ensure that the following four operators are effects : @xmath44 it is straightforward to verify that equations ( [ simple - jm ] ) hold and hence , these effects define a joint observable @xmath39 for @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the joint measurability condition for two simple observables can be interpreted as the requirement that the intersection of four cones in the set of effects is nonempty .",
    "the order relation @xmath45 for two selfadjoint operators is equivalent to either of @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the condition @xmath48 defines a convex cone in the real vector space of selfadjoint operators . , then @xmath49 for any @xmath50 $ ] . ]",
    "thus we can define the upward and downward cones of a selfadjoint operator @xmath9 as @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the joint measurability condition for observables @xmath0 and @xmath1 now reads : @xmath53    [ ex : trivial - coex ] in the following four cases , joint measurability falls out trivially : + ( a ) @xmath54 : put @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 .",

    "nontrivial cases are exactly those in which @xmath78 for every @xmath37 .",

    "we note that in general two observables may have many different joint observables ; this fact will be demonstrated in section [ sec : covjoint ] .",
    "for later use we recall the following general fact .",
    "the set of observables on a fixed outcome space is convex : for two observables @xmath87 and any @xmath88 $ ] , a new observable @xmath89 is defined as @xmath90 .",

    "assume that two observables @xmath2 and @xmath3 do not have a joint measurement .",
    "we may still ask if it could be possible to obtain some information on both observables in a single measurement scheme .",
    "one way of approaching this task is to consider whether there are two jointly measurable observables @xmath4 that are close to @xmath5 , respectively , in a sense to be determined .",
    "any joint measurement of @xmath0 and @xmath1 can then be regarded as an approximate joint measurement of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "a natural characterization of the closeness between two observables ( assumed to have the same outcome space ) is based on the degree of similarity of their associated probability distributions for all states .",
    "hence we define the distance between observables @xmath2 and @xmath3 in the following way : @xmath98-{\\textrm{tr}}[t{\\mathcal{b}}_j]\\big|=\\max_{j}{\\left\\|{\\mathcal{a}}_j-{\\mathcal{b}}_j\\right\\|}.\\ ] ] clearly , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 if and only if @xmath101",

    "here we briefly illustrate this approach in the case of simple observables from the perspective of the general framework . we refer to (",
    "* chapter 7 ) for a review and examples on this topic",

    "if , for instance , @xmath2 is a sharp observable then @xmath110    to give an example of jointly measurable observables , assume that @xmath0 and @xmath1 are defined as in ( [ smear ] ) . since we want to approximate @xmath2 by @xmath0 and @xmath3 by @xmath1 , it is natural to require that @xmath111 in fact , if these inequalities do not hold , one can choose @xmath112 , @xmath113 to obtain new coarse - grainings which do satisfy the inequalities .    now , define @xmath114 .",
    "condition ( [ smatrix ] ) implies that @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "the remaining inequality required for joint measurability , @xmath117 , depends on the specific structure of the observables @xmath2 and @xmath3 ; it is ensured to hold independently of @xmath2 and @xmath3 if @xmath118 this shows that one can always construct ( nontrivial ) jointly measurable coarse - grainings ; a possible choice is , for instance , @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "in the 2-dimensional hilbert space of a qubit one can take the unit operator @xmath121 together with the pauli operators @xmath122 as a basis of the real vector space of selfadjoint linear operators .",
    "the latter can be defined with respect to any fixed basis of orthogonal unit vectors @xmath123 so that the usual relations are satisfied : @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 .",
    "we will write @xmath127 for the operator triple @xmath128",
    ". states of a qubit can be written in the form @xmath129 , where @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "the pure states are characterized by the condition @xmath132 .    for each @xmath133",
    ", we denote @xmath134 the eigenvalues of the operator @xmath135 are @xmath136 .",
    "hence , @xmath135 is an effect if @xmath137 which implies , in particular , that @xmath138 .",
    "the operator @xmath135 is a nontrivial projection if @xmath139 the spectral decomposition of the effect @xmath135 , @xmath140 , is ( putting @xmath141 ) @xmath142 for later use we note the commutator of two effects @xmath143 and @xmath144 : @xmath145=\\tfrac{1}{2 } \\left({\\mathbf{a}}\\times{\\mathbf{b}}\\right ) \\cdot { \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}}.\\ ] ]    since the hilbert space of a qubit is 2-dimensional , any sharp qubit observable is ( effectively ) simple .",
    "it is clear that this restriction does not apply for a qubit observable in general ; one can write the identity operator @xmath121 as a sum of arbitrarily many different effects .",
    "it is also known that for some quantum informational tasks , such as unambiguous state discrimination , one needs other qubit observables than the simple ones ; see e.g. @xcite . here",
    "we shall , however , concentrate on simple qubit observables as our aim is to study approximate joint measurements of sharp qubit observables . to clarify further the nature of sharp qubit observables , we note that again due to the low dimensionality , the projections that constitute such an observable are of rank one , which implies that their repeatable measurements are von neumann measurements @xcite .",
    "we denote by @xmath146 the simple qubit observable defined as @xmath147 a special case is given by the sharp observables @xmath148 . the spectral decomposition ( [ eqn : spectraldecom ] ) of @xmath143 shows that @xmath146 is a coarse - graining of @xmath149 .    from the above commutator formula we recover the well known fact that the observables @xmath146 and @xmath150 commute exactly when the vectors @xmath151 and @xmath152 are collinear . together with proposition [ prop : com ] , this shows that an observable @xmath150 is jointly measurable with a sharp observable @xmath149 if and only if @xmath150 is a coarse - graining of @xmath149 .",
    "a joint measurement of that kind is of little value ; one can simply measure @xmath149 alone to get the same information .",

    "an observable @xmath146 was selected in relation to a sharp observable @xmath164 by the requirement that the expectation values of @xmath146 are proportional to those of @xmath164 .",
    "this requirement , called there _ unbiasedness _ , is equivalent with the fact that @xmath159 and the vectors @xmath151 and @xmath165 are parallel .",

    "the sharpness of an observable @xmath146 is thus found to be @xmath166 with this expression one can easily confirm the statements of section [ sec : effects ] for simple qubit observables : @xmath167 exactly when @xmath146 is a sharp observable and @xmath168 exactly when @xmath146 is a trivial observable .",
    "we also note the following useful observation : @xmath169    the distance between two qubit observables @xmath146 and @xmath150 is given by the formula @xmath170 this shows , in particular , that the distance of a given observable @xmath146 from any sharp observable @xmath164 is minimal when @xmath171 , or in other words , when @xmath146 is a coarse - graining of @xmath164 . in this case",
    "we have @xmath172 we also note the following : @xmath173    finally , from equations ( [ eqn : sharpness - qubit ] ) and ( [ eqn : distance - aa ] ) we get the following relations : @xmath174 the last equation shows that the distance between @xmath175 and @xmath148 is directly related to the sharpness of @xmath175 .",
    "this is not surprising when we recall that @xmath175 is a coarse - graining of @xmath148 .",
    "the joint measurability conditions ( [ eqn : cone - condition ] ) applied to two qubit observables @xmath176 takes the following form : there exists an operator @xmath177 such that @xmath178 let @xmath179 denote the closed ball with center @xmath180 and radius @xmath181 .",
    "then it is seen that the joint measurability of @xmath176 is equivalent to the statement that there exists a number @xmath182 such that the intersection of four balls is non - empty : @xmath183    the criterion ( [ eqn : ball - coex ] ) immediately gives the following as a necessary condition for joint measurability : the two pairs of balls diagonally opposite to each other must have separations which are no greater than the sum of their radii ; thus , there must be a @xmath182 such that @xmath184 or equivalently , @xmath185\\le \\gamma\\le{\\tfrac{1}{2}}[\\alpha+\\beta]-{\\tfrac{1}{2}}{\\left\\|{\\mathbf{a}}-{\\mathbf{b}}\\right\\|}=:\\gamma_2.\\ ] ] this gives an interval for @xmath186 to lie in which has to be nonempty .",

    "if a sharp observable @xmath369 is approximated by one of its coarse - grainings @xmath146 , the distance is related to the sharpness of @xmath146 via the relation ( [ eqn : dist - sharp ] ) .",
    "trough the case study of qubit observables we have demonstrated the conceptual difference of measurement inaccuracy and intrinsic unsharpness .",
    "this sheds some new light on the joint measurement problem raised by uffink in @xcite , so we shortly recall his argumentation .",
    "uffink analyzed a definition of  non - ideal \" or ",
    "unsharp \" joint measurement of two noncommuting observables that had previously been sketched out more or less informally by various authors .",
    "this definition captures the idea that smearings of two noncommuting sharp observables may have a joint observable .",
    "as it was formulated , this definition allowed any smeared or coarse - grained version of an observable to be an approximation of that observable , without further stipulations on the quality of the approximation .",
    "this entails that even trivial observables ( which are always among the coarse - grainings of any observable ) can be taken to represent a sort of non - ideal measurement of a given observable .",
    "uffink presented an example that makes this definition look absurdly comprehensive and indeed counter - intuitive : he considered two pairs of observables , @xmath370 and @xmath371 and took @xmath372 as a coarse - graining of the first pair and @xmath373 as a coarse - graining of the second .",
    "then @xmath374 is a joint observable for these two , and according to the letter of the definition , it would have to be considered as representing a non - ideal or unsharp joint measurement of the original pairs .",
    "now , uffink argued that while the final joint observable had @xmath372 and @xmath373 as coarse - grainings ( namely , marginals ) , the original observables were in no way coarse - grainings of it .",
    "hence there was no plausible sense in which @xmath374 could be regarded as representing a non - ideal joint measurement of the original pairs of observables .",
    "he thus pointed out rightly that a universal definition or criterion of approximate joint measurability was missing .",
    "but then he jumped to the conclusion that poms do not contribute to solving the joint measurement problem .",
    "we think that the present paper and many preceding it demonstrate that poms do provide an appropriate language to clarify the definition and quantification of approximate measurements , and to determine any limitations to the accuracy of joint approximations of noncommuting pairs of observables .",
    "it is obvious that any measurement can be considered as an  approximate \" joint measurement of an arbitrary collection of observables . even doing nothing and randomly picking outcomes",
    "constitutes a trivial  non - ideal \" joint measurement of any given set of observables .",
    "there is no problem in allowing a definition of non - ideal or approximate joint measurements to include trivial cases ; what makes any such definition useful is whether it allows one to give quantifications of how well each of the observables in question is being approximated by a given scheme .",
    "as we have shown in this paper and its companion @xcite , such quantifications can indeed be formulated and yield a nontrivial notion of approximate measurement , leading to the conclusion that there are universal limitations to the accuracies with which noncommuting pairs of observables can be approximately measured together .    if the quality of the approximation is to be optimized , the approximating observables being measured jointly must be unsharp ; and the required degree of unsharpness is linked with the quality of the approximations specified . using the definition of approximation introduced here , and keeping in mind the conceptual difference between the relation of approximation and the property of intrinsic unsharpness , it is clear that the above  absurd \" example considered by uffink is simply not based on good approximations and would therefore not be regarded as a useful joint measurement .",
    "the quantifications of inaccuracy and intrinsic unsharpness presented here for the case of qubit observables complements analogous investigations carried out in the case of continuous observables in @xcite .",
    "a unified approach and associated trade - off relations for the approximate joint measurements of general pairs of noncommuting quantities is still outstanding .",
