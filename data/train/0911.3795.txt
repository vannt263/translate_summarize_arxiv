    "the existence of non  baryonic dark matter ( dm ) in the universe is by now well established @xcite .",
    "recent observations determine the universal average dm density quite accurately . the exact value and its uncertainty depend somewhat on the assumptions made in the fit ( `` priors '' ) . for example , within a minimal @xmath13cdm model , and combining data on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies with observations of supernovae of type 1a and with analyses of baryon acoustic oscillations",
    ", one finds @xcite : @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the energy density of cold dark matter in units of the critical density , and @xmath16 is the scaled hubble parameter such that @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the current hubble parameter .",
    "introducing additional parameters in the fit can increase the allowed range ; for example , significantly larger values of @xmath19 are allowed if the number of particles that were relativistic when the cmb decoupled is kept free @xcite .",
    "however , the minimal model describes the data well . moreover , quite soon data from the planck satellite are expected to reduce the error on @xmath19 to the level of 1.5% using cmb measurements alone @xcite .    from the particle physics point of view , weakly interacting massive particle ( wimps ) are among the most attractive dm candidates . in standard cosmology",
    "their thermal relic density is naturally of the right order of magnitude . owing to their weak interactions",
    ", they can be probed through both direct and indirect detection experiments @xcite , although no convincing signal has yet been found . moreover ,",
    "the existence of wimps is _ independently _ motivated in many extensions of the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics , the most prominent example being extensions based on supersymmetry ( susy ) .    in order to fully exploit the precision of present cosmological data , the theoretical error on the prediction for the wimp relic density should not exceed the error inferred from observations . for a given cosmological model , the wimp relic density",
    "is determined uniquely by its annihilation cross section into sm particles , if all wimps were produced thermally .",
    "this requires that the post  inflationary universe was sufficiently hot , with temperature exceeding about 5% of the wimp mass .",
    "moreover , one has to assume that no other , heavier particles decayed into wimps after wimp decoupling . under these conditions , which are satisfied for standard cosmology",
    ", the uncertainty of the current wimp relic density is essentially given by the uncertainty of the wimp annihilation cross section . in order to calculate this cross section to percent level accuracy , at least leading radiative corrections will have to be included .    in this paper",
    "we calculate one class of potentially sizable radiative corrections , which are due to the exchange of a boson between the wimps prior to their annihilation . if the mass @xmath2 of the exchanged boson vanishes , the one  loop expression diverges in the limit of vanishing relative velocity @xmath20 between the annihilating wimps .",
    "these large `` sommerfeld '' corrections then have to be re  summed to all orders in the relevant coupling @xcite ( for earlier , related work see @xcite ) .",
    "however , since wimps couple neither to photons nor to gluons , a new light boson with sizable coupling to the wimps , but not to sm particles , has to be introduced .",
    "the required hierarchy @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the mass of the wimp , then raises naturalness issues .",
    "here we instead study the case @xmath4 $ \\sim$}}~}m_\\chi$ ] .",
    "examples are the exchange of the light higgs boson in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm ) , and the exchange of the @xmath23 boson in most `` generic '' wimp models . if @xmath4 $ \\sim$}}~}m_\\chi$ ] and @xmath24 these corrections can be significantly bigger than the `` generic '' estimate @xmath25 ( a few ) @xmath26 , while remaining small enough to permit simple one  loop calculations ( and without threatening unitarity @xcite ) .",
    "we calculate these corrections in the non  relativistic limit , following iengo @xcite .",
    "since wimps decouple at temperature @xmath27 , an expansion in the relative velocity usually ( but not always @xcite ) converges quite fast , and can therefore be used in the calculation of the one  loop correction .",
    "we also show how to compute the relevant thermal average over the corrected cross sections .",
    "we first apply our formalism to simple models with scalar or fermionic sm singlet wimps ; the corrections are always small in the former case , but can be sizable in the latter scenario .",
    "we then analyze neutralino annihilation in the mssm , and show that these corrections can reduce the relic density of strongly mixed neutralinos by more than 1% , comparable to the projected uncertainty of the value to be inferred from planck data .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : corr_a ] we introduce the formalism , which was initially proposed to treat non  perturbative sommerfeld enhancement @xcite .",
    "in particular , we factorize the correction to the amplitude due to the boson exchange between two incoming particles . in sec .  [",
    "sec : relicdensity ] we briefly review the standard calculation of dark matter relic density , and describe the thermal averaging of the corrected cross section . numerical results for three wimp models will be presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerical_calculation ] .",
    "finally we will summarize .",
    "some details of our numerical procedure are described in appendix a , while appendix b shows that our approximate treatment indeed reproduces the leading terms of an exact calculation of radiative corrections associated with the initial state in a simple scalar model .",
    "consider the annihilation of two wimps @xmath0 into two sm particles : @xmath28 generic tree  level diagrams contributing to this process have the form shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : a ] .",
    "we want to compute one  loop corrections of the kind shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : b ] , where a boson @xmath1 is exchanged between the wimps before they annihilate , by adapting the formalism of iengo @xcite .",
    "we assume that @xmath0 is a majorana fermion ; however , in the non  relativistic limit this will be relevant only for the case where the exchanged boson has axial vector couplings ( see below ) .    in this formalism @xmath1 exchange and @xmath0 annihilation",
    "are factorized ; the former can then also be understood as re  scattering of the incoming wimps prior to their annihilation .",
    "this factorization ( @xmath1 exchange before @xmath0 annihilation ) is only expected to work in the non  relativistic limit .",
    "moreover , it requires the virtuality of the @xmath1 propagator to be ( much ) smaller than that of the particle exchanged in @xmath0 annihilation .",
    "the latter can always be satisfied for @xmath21 , where @xmath2 is the mass of the exchanged boson , but it can also be satisfied for @xmath29 if the wimps annihilate through the exchange of a particle @xmath30 with mass @xmath31 .",

    "in the cms we have @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the initial state kinematics is thus fixed by @xmath40 .",
    "we write the one  loop corrected amplitude for annihilation from the partial wave denoted by @xmath41 as @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 denote the tree  level amplitude and the one  loop correction term , respectively .",
    "we are only interested in the cases @xmath45 and @xmath46 . the contribution of higher partial waves is strongly suppressed during wimp freeze  out .",
    "the corrections can be calculated starting from the observation that annihilation from an @xmath47wave initial state can be described by a pseudoscalar ( scalar ) @xmath0 current @xcite .",
    "this allows to write the correction as a standard vertex ( three  point function ) correction .",

    "@xmath57 in fact does not depend on @xmath58 if @xmath59 annihilation proceeds through an @xmath60channel diagram . for @xmath61 or @xmath62channel annihilation",

    ".    to zeroth order in the non  relativistic expansion we can set @xmath71 in the numerator of eq.([en2 ] ) .",
    "we see that this gives a non  vanishing result only if @xmath72 , i.e. if a @xmath52 matrix is present ; recall that this corresponds to annihilation from an @xmath5wave . to this order we can replace @xmath73 acting to the right ( on the @xmath62spinor ) by @xmath22 . the numerator of eq.([en2 ] ) then reduces to @xmath74 .",
    "note that the factor of @xmath52 is required in order to be able to access the large component of @xmath75 ; this is most easily seen in the dirac representation .",
    "moreover , the factor @xmath76 in the denominator of eq.([en2 ] ) can be replaced by @xmath77 , up to corrections which are of second order in three  momenta .    to summarize ,",
    "we have made three approximations :    1 .",
    "we ignored the energy dependence of the @xmath1 propagator .",
    "2 .   in the @xmath64",
    "integral we only kept the pole with the leading residue ( in the non  relativistic limit ) .",
    "we ignore all @xmath53 dependence in the numerator ( for annihilation from the @xmath5wave ) .",
    "note that these approximations have to be taken simultaneously in order to get a uv  finite result .",
    "one may worry that this gives a rather poor approximation of the exact vertex correction even in cases where the latter are finite , as in a purely scalar theory . in appendix",
    "b we show that this approximation can indeed differ substantially from the exact vertex correction if @xmath21 .",
    "note that the exact vertex correction by itself becomes ir ",
    "divergent for @xmath78 .",
    "this leads to terms @xmath79 which appear in the exact vertex correction , but not in our approximation .",
    "however , these terms are canceled by real emission diagrams and wave function corrections , which have to be included in order to obtain an ir  finite result for @xmath78 . in appendix",
    "b we show that , at least for a simple scalar model , our approximation _ does _ accurately reproduce the _ exact _ radiative correction associated with the initial state , whenever these corrections are large .",
    "let us therefore proceed with our calculation , which does not require additional approximations .",
    "the angular integrations are straightforward .",
    "one is then left with a single integral to describe the correction to @xmath5wave annihilation : @xmath80 note that we have absorbed the spinors into the full tree ",
    "level amplitude @xmath81 .",
    "the one  loop correction to the cross section emerges from the interference between the correction @xmath82 and the tree ",
    "level term @xmath81 .",
    "we can thus write @xmath83 where @xmath20 is the relative velocity between the two annihilating wimps in their center of mass frame ( i.e. , @xmath84 ) , and we have defined the function @xmath85\\ , .\\ ] ] here @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "so far we have assumed that a spin0 boson with scalar coupling is exchanged between the annihilating wimps . in order to treat more general cases , we rewrite the numerator of eq.([en2 ] ) as @xmath88 where @xmath89 describes the dirac structure of the @xmath90 coupling and @xmath91 its dirac conjugate .",
    "scalar exchange corresponds to @xmath92 .",
    "it is easy to see that pseudoscalar exchange , @xmath93 , does not lead to enhanced contributions .",
    "for example , for @xmath72 and @xmath94 one finds a result @xmath95 , which is @xmath96 .",
    "vector exchange corresponds to @xmath97 , where the lorentz index @xmath98 has to be summed . for @xmath99 and @xmath94",
    "this gives @xmath100 again replacing @xmath101 by @xmath22 this leads to the _ same _ result as for scalar exchange , except for an overall sign .",
    "however , this sign is compensated by the extra minus sign in the vector boson propagator .",
    "we thus reproduce the well  known result that in the non  relativistic limit , the exchange of a vector boson has the same effect as that of a scalar boson .",
    "finally , axial vector exchange is described by setting @xmath102 , where summation over @xmath98 is again implied . in the @xmath5wave case , where @xmath72 and @xmath94 in the numerator , this gives @xmath103 again replacing @xmath101 by @xmath22 , and accounting for the minus sign in the spin1 propagator",
    ", we find that axial vector exchange differs from scalar or vector exchange by a factor of @xmath104 .",
    "this does not seem to have been noticed in the recent literature .",
    "we therefore checked it in the limit where @xmath1 exchange can be treated as re  scattering of the incoming wimps , leading again to two on  shell wimps . to leading order in velocity expansion we are interested in the limit of vanishing momentum exchange .",
    "however , we have to keep in mind that the two wimps will have to annihilate through a @xmath52 vertex ( for the @xmath5wave case ) .",
    "this requires that the non ",
    "relativistic @xmath105 and @xmath20 spinors have the same spin .",
    "the rescattering process is then described by the quantity ( we omit the bosonic propagator and all couplings ) @xmath106 where @xmath107 describe the spin .",
    "scalar boson exchange again corresponds to @xmath108 . in this case",
    "only @xmath109 contributes in the non  relativistic limit , where ( in the cms ) @xmath110 , and one has @xmath111 .",
    "one immediately sees that pseudoscalar exchange only contributes at @xmath112 .    in case of vector exchange",
    ", only @xmath113 contributes to @xmath114 @xcite .",
    "this then again requires @xmath115 in eq.([en5 ] ) , giving @xmath116 . remembering the additional minus sign in the spin1 propagator we therefore again find that vector boson exchange contributes the same way as scalar exchange .    finally , for axial vector exchange",
    ", only @xmath117 contribute to @xmath118 . in this case",
    "@xmath119 receives non  vanishing contributions both from @xmath120 and from @xmath121 , so that @xmath122 . again including the minus sign from the propagator",
    ", we reproduce our earlier result that axial vector exchange differs from scalar or vector exchange by a factor of @xmath104 .",
    "note also that axial vector exchange describes an interaction between the spins of the two wimps .",
    "such interactions are not suppressed at low velocities .",
    "now let us discuss @xmath6wave annihilation , which corresponds to @xmath123 in eq.([en2 ] ) .",
    "in this case setting @xmath124 would lead to a result which is of @xmath125 , i.e. of _ second _ order in the non  relativistic expansion .",
    "the leading term is the one linear in @xmath53 ; the numerator of eq.([en2 ] ) then becomes @xmath126 .",
    "note that the @xmath127 again allow to access the large component of @xmath75 .",
    "the proper form of the correction term can then most easily be obtained using trace techniques , by dividing the 1loop correction term @xmath128 by the tree ",
    "level result @xmath129 .",
    "we find that the @xmath6wave correction term differs from the @xmath5wave term by a factor @xmath130 inside the momentum integral .",
    "performing the angular integrals , we can write this in the form of eq.([eq : a_s ] ) , with a new function describing the correction for annihilation from a @xmath6wave initial state : @xmath131 \\right\\}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath132 as above .    in order to treat the exchange of other bosons ,",
    "non  trivial dirac structures @xmath133 again have to be introduced in eq.([en2 ] ) , now for the case @xmath134 .",
    "proceeding as above , we find that pseudoscalar exchange does not lead to a large correction , while vector and axial vector exchange give the _ same _ correction as the exchange of a scalar boson . at first glance",
    "it may seem surprising that now axial vector exchange gives the same , positive , contribution ; recall that in case of annihilation from an @xmath5wave , axial vector exchange differed by a factor of @xmath104 .",
    "the difference can be understood from the observation that axial vector exchange leads to a spin ",
    "spin interaction of the form @xmath135 , where @xmath136 are the spins of the two wimps .",
    "this can be evaluated using @xmath137 , where @xmath138 is the total spin . in case of majorana wimps , annihilation from an @xmath5wave",
    "requires @xcite @xmath139 , leading to @xmath140 . for @xmath6wave annihilation",
    ", we need @xcite @xmath141 , giving @xmath142 .",
    "note the relative factor of @xmath104 between these two results .    at this point a comment on other wimps ( than majorana fermions ) is in order . for a dirac fermion ",
    "antifermion pair , there is no strict correspondence between the total spin and the orbital angular momentum .",
    "there will also be @xmath5wave states with @xmath141 ( as the @xmath143 family of quarkonia ) , as well as @xmath6wave states with @xmath139 . in this case the proper factor in front of the axial vector correction will depend on the spin state , i.e. it will no longer be completely process independent in this case .",
    "however , results for scalar , pseudoscalar and vector exchange are the same as for majorana wimps .",
    "finally , there is no such thing as an axial vector coupling to scalars , but our results for vector exchange apply to scalar wimps as well .",
    "scalar exchange now involves a trilinear scalar interaction @xmath144 , which has dimension of mass .",
    "our results can describe this situation as well , with @xmath145 .",
    "the integrals in eqs.([eq : i_s ] ) and ( [ eq : i_p ] ) should be understood as principal value integrals , in order to treat the pole at @xmath146 . in case",
    "@xmath147 the integrals can be computed analytically , by expanding the logarithms in inverse powers of @xmath148 . moreover , in the limit @xmath149 both @xmath150 and @xmath151 approach @xmath152 , thereby reproducing the well  known result @xcite that the one  loop `` sommerfeld factor '' for massless boson exchange is the same for @xmath5 and @xmath6partial waves .",
    "we also found accurate numerical expressions for small and moderate @xmath148 .",
    "altogether , the correction factors can be described by @xmath153 the approximations for large and small @xmath148 intersect at @xmath154 for @xmath155 ; the two approximations for @xmath151 intersect a second time at @xmath156 .    in fig .",

    "this leads to slightly larger discrepancies , of up to 6% , between the exact @xmath151 and its approximations at @xmath159 where the two approximations intersect . for the purpose of calculating the wimp relic density",
    "a relative error on the _ correction _ of 6% is quite acceptable .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : s_p.eps ] we show @xmath160 and @xmath161 as black and red ( grey ) lines , respectively .",

    "the @xmath5wave contribution is larger than the @xmath6wave one , by up to a factor of 3 at large @xmath148 ; see eqs.([approximation_i ] ) .",

    "we finally note that our numerical results are consistent with those in ref .  @xcite .",
    "in this section we describe how to calculate the loop  corrected wimp relic density from the loop  corrected wimp annihilation cross section .",
    "the evolution of the wimp number density @xmath170 with time @xmath171 in the early universe is governed by the boltzmann equation @xcite @xmath172 here @xmath173 is the hubble parameter describing the expansion of the universe , @xmath174 is the total wimp annihilation cross section , @xmath20 is again the relative velocity between the annihilating wimps in their center of mass frame , @xmath175 is the wimp number density in thermal equilibrium , and @xmath176 denotes thermal averaging . for non  relativistic kinematics , the latter is given by @xmath177 where @xmath178 , @xmath179 being the temperature of the thermal bath .",

    "more importantly , we see that the corrections due to @xmath1 exchange in the initial state can easily exceed the uncertainty of the observational determination of the dm relic density ; for @xmath263 they even reach the 10% level for @xmath264 gev .",
    "since the correction is positive , one would have to reduce the coupling in order to obtain the correct relic density after inclusion of one  loop corrections .",
