    "in a recent work @xcite , maddah - ali and niesen considered the caching problem which deals with improving the content delivery efficiency , _",
    "i.e. _ , the total traffic rate @xmath2 in the delivery phase , through the utilization of local cache memory of capacity @xmath3 each where the coded contents are strategically prepared in the placement phase , in a system with @xmath4 files and @xmath5 users .",
    "it was shown coded caching can be rather beneficial , and in fact orderly optimal , while uncoded caching solution suffers a significant loss .",
    "subsequent works extended it to decentralized caching placements @xcite , caching with nonuniform demands @xcite , and online caching placements @xcite , etc ..    despite these advances , the fundamental tradeoff between the delivery traffic rate @xmath2 and cache memory capacity @xmath3 is not fully known except the two - user two - file case .",
    "this is partly due to the fact that the main focus of these existing investigations @xcite is on the regime when the number of files and the number of users are both large , where coded caching can provide the largest gain over the uncoded counterpart .",
    "however , within the problem setting of@xcite , the number of users @xmath5 accounted for in the placement phase is also the total number of simultaneous content requests in the delivery phase , and in some applications the number of simultaneous data requests can be quite small . in such scenarios , better understanding of the fundamental limits of the caching problem , when either @xmath4 or @xmath5 is small , in fact becomes rather important .",
    "the outer bound provided in @xcite was obtained through a cut - set argument , and it is generally suspected to be not tight .",
    "however , stronger outer bounds appear difficult to find analytically . in this short note",
    ", we provide an improved outer bound for the case with @xmath0 files and @xmath1 users , which is obtained using the computational approach developed in @xcite .",
    "this outer bound is included in the online collection of `` solutions of computed information theoretic limits ( scitl ) '' at @xcite , where the data files for the proof can be downloaded for further processing .",
    "we use the problem definition and notation given in @xcite : @xmath3 is the capacity of the local memory cache size , and @xmath2 is the multicast rate in the delivery transmission ; each file is assumed to have unit size , _",
    "@xmath7 , since normalizing by @xmath8 does not cause any essential loss here .",
    "the main result of this note is the following theorem .    the memory - delivery - rate tradeoff for the @xmath6 coded caching problem must satisfy : @xmath9    .",
    "[ fig : region],width=377 ]    this region is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : region ] .",
    "we note that the point @xmath10 , which was shown to be achievable in @xcite , is optimal since it is on the boundary of the outer bound .",
    "the first two and the last two inequalities in ( [ eqn : bounds ] ) are already known in @xcite .",
    "the remaining ones are new , and we discuss them in some details in the next section . for reference ,",
    "the inner bound given in @xcite through a centralized placement algorithm is also plotted .",
    "we shall not provide the full details of the proof in this note , since some of them can be rather large ( in a table form , or long when written down as chains of inequalities ) .",
    "however , one of the inequalities is discussed in some depth in section [ sec : translation ] to illustrate the manner this bound is obtained , and interested readers are referred to @xcite for more details .",
    "in this section we discuss the symmetry we utilized to reduce the complexity of the computation , which is important to understand the tabulation based proof . in the sequel we use @xmath11 to denote the @xmath12-th ( random )",
    "file , @xmath13 to denote the content stored at the @xmath12-th user .",
    "the multicasted message in the delivery phase is written as @xmath14 , meaning that it is the message when the first user demands the @xmath12-th file , the second user demands the @xmath15-th file , and the third user demands the @xmath16-th file .",
    "the files are mutually independent .",
    "similar as in @xcite , it can be shown that without loss of generality we can consider only symmetric codes . however , here the symmetry structure is different from that in @xcite . in the computational approach ,",
    "we utilize the following type of symmetry to reduce the computation .",
    "let three sets of random variables be given as @xmath17 let a permutation function be defined as @xmath18 on the set of @xmath19 .",
    "the permutation operates on the set of @xmath20 as follows @xmath21 and on the set @xmath22 as follows @xmath23 for example the permutation function @xmath24 maps @xmath25 to @xmath26 , but maps any @xmath27 to @xmath28 , and thus the set @xmath29 to @xmath30 .",
    "we call a given caching code symmetric , if for any @xmath31 , and any permutation @xmath32 , we have @xmath33 as a reality check , consider @xmath34 under the aforementioned permutation : it should be equal to @xmath35 ; notice that @xmath36 is a function of @xmath37 and under the permutation , @xmath36 is still a function of @xmath38 .",
    "intuitively , we prove that symmetric codes are without loss of optimality based on the idea of time ( space ) sharing : encode @xmath39 of the three files and place the coded cache in a permuted order at the three users , which will remove any asymmetry in the code .",
    "we plan to explore the symmetry structure further in a subsequent work .",
    ".the entropy terms used in the proof . [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     to illustrate the proof obtained using the computational approach , consider the inequality @xmath40 , which is particularly simple to prove .",
    "this proof is a direct translation of the solution obtained using the computational approach , which are given in table [ tab : correspondence ] and table [ table : cancellation ] , where we use @xmath7 to denote the unit of the file size .",
    "we can alternatively write the following chain of inequalities @xmath41 where ( s ) is for reason of symmetry , and ( a ) is because the message @xmath42 together with the coded content cached at user-@xmath43 , _",
    "i.e. , @xmath44 _ , can recover @xmath45 , ( b ) is because of the assumption that each file has unit size as well as the chain rule , and ( c ) is because the coded content cached at user-@xmath46 , _",
    "i.e. , @xmath47 _ , together with @xmath42 can recover @xmath36 , and @xmath47 together with @xmath48 can also recover @xmath49 . note the five inequalities in ( [ eqn : chain ] )",
    "correspond to the five rows in table [ table : cancellation ] , though not in the same order , and not the exact same form because of the symmetry structure and application of certain chain rule simplifications .",
    "an improved outer bound is given for the caching problem when @xmath6 in this note .",
    "this result is part of the online collection of `` solutions of computed information theoretic limits ( scitl ) '' hosted at @xcite , which hopefully in the future can serve as a data depot for information theoretic limits obtained through computational approaches .",
    "some results in this collection requires non - trivial variation of the approach outlined in @xcite , the details of which will be presented elsewhere ."
