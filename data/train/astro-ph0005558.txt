    "the canonical model of cosmology assumes that large - scale structure has grown out of small density perturbations via the process of gravitational instability .",
    "these initial fluctuations are usually assumed to satisfy the statistics of a gaussian random field , solely characterized by its power spectrum . in the linear regime ,",
    "the fluctuations grow self - similarly and retain their initial distribution and power spectrum shape . therefore , mapping the underlying cosmological velocity field and its power spectrum on large scales , provides a direct probe to the origin of structure in the universe .",
    "the ps , the three - dimensional distribution of luminous matter and the predicted peculiar velocity field have been derived from a variety of data sets , especially from all - sky redshift surveys (  strauss & willick 1995 for a review of earlier work ; sutherland 1999 ; branchini 1999 ) . unfortunately , however , the distribution of galaxies in these catalogs is not necessarily an unbiased tracer of the underlying mass distribution , and suffer from the infamous `` galaxy biasing '' problem .",
    "furthermore , in estimates from redshift surveys , uncertainties arise from the complicated relation between the real space and the redshift space distributions , known as redshift distortions ( , kaiser 1987 , zaroubi and hoffman 1996 ) . in order to avoid these problems altogether",
    "it is advantageous to appeal to dynamical data , in particular catalogs of galaxy peculiar velocities on large scales .",
    "peculiar velocities enable a direct and reliable determination of the mass ps and distribution , under the natural assumption that the galaxies are unbiased tracers of the large - scale , gravitationally - induced , velocity field . furthermore ,",
    "since peculiar velocities are non - local and have contributions from different scales , analysis of the peculiar velocity field provides information on scales somewhat larger than the sampled region ( hoffman 2000 ) . for the same reason peculiar velocities",
    "are adequately described by linear theory even when densities become quasi - linear ( , freudling 1999 ) .",
    "consequently , the dynamics and the distribution of peculiar velocities are well described by the linear regime of gravitational instability and by a gaussian probability distribution function ( pdf ) , respectively .    assuming that both the underlying velocity field and the errors are drawn from independent random gaussian fields , the observed peculiar velocities constitute a multi - variant gaussian data set , albeit the sparse and inhomogeneous sampling .",
    "the corresponding _ posterior _ pdf is a multivariate gaussian that is completely determined by the assumed ps and covariance matrix of errors . under these conditions",
    "one can write the joint pdf of the model ps and the underlying velocity or density field .",
    "the purpose of the present study is to calculate , from the joint pdf , the ps and 3d mass distribution , as well as the 3d peculiar velocity field , as derived from the newly completed enear galaxy peculiar velocity catalog ( da costa 2000a , paper  i ) .",
    "first , the ps model parameters are estimated by maximizing the likelihood function given the model ( zaroubi 1997 ) .",
    "an identical likelihood estimation of the power spectrum has been previously applied to the mark iii ( zaroubi 1997 ) and the sfi ( freudling 1999 ) data sets . in both cases",
    "the analysis yielded a high amplitude power spectrum .",
    "although the results from those two catalogs are consistent with each other , they are marginally inconsistent with the power spectra measured from redshift catalogs ( , da costa 1996 ; sutherland 1999 ) , inferred from the analysis of the velocity correlation function ( borgani 2000a , 2000b ) , and from velocity - velocity comparisons ( , davis 1996 , da costa 1998 ) .",
    "one of our goals is to use the same methodology employed before for the mark  iii and sfi to the new enear catalog to directly test the reproducibility of the results with an independent sample based on a different distance indicator but probing a comparable volume .",
    "second , the wiener filter ( wf ) solution of the field is recovered by finding the most probable field given the ps and the data ( zaroubi 1995 , 1999 ) . constrained realizations ( cr )",
    "are then used to sample the statistical scatter around the wf field ( hoffman and ribak 1991 ) .",
    "the mass density ps is used to calculate the smoothed wiener filtered density and 3d velocity fields given the measured radial velocities ( zaroubi 1995 , 1999 ) .",
    "the wf provides an optimal estimator of the underlying field in the sense of a minimum - variance solution given the data and an assumed  model ( wiener 1949 ; press  1992 ) .",
    "the  defines the data auto - correlation and the data - field cross - correlation matrices . in the case where the data is drawn from a random gaussian field ,",
    "the wf estimator coincides with the conditional mean field and with the most probable configuration given the data ( see zaroubi 1995 ) .",
    "it should be noted that kaiser & stebbins ( 1991 ) were the first to propose a bayesian solution to the problem of reconstruction from peculiar velocity data sets .",
    "finally , the recovered three - dimensional velocity field is used to compute the amplitude of the bulk flow and to decompose the velocity field in terms of a divergent and tidal components which enables one to separate the contribution to the measured peculiar velocity field from mass fluctuations within and outside the volume probed by the data ( hoffman 2000 ) .",
    "the methods adopted in this study do not involve any explicit window function , weighting or smoothing the data .",
    "in addition , they automatically underweight noisy , unreliable data . however , a few simplifying assumptions are required : 1 ) peculiar velocities are drawn from a gaussian random field ; 2 ) peculiar velocities are related to the densities through linear theory ; 3 ) errors in the @xmath13 inferred distances constitute a gaussian random field with two components , the first scales linearly with distance while the second models the nonlinear evolution of the velocities as a constant scatter .",
    "the need to assume a parametric functional form for the ps is also a limitation .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in ",
    "[ sec : data ] we briefly describe the peculiar velocity data used in the present analysis .",
    "the ps analysis is carried out in   [ sec : ps ] .",
    "the wiener filtering is applied to the enear data in   [ sec : wiener ] , where maps of the density field are presented and compared to those predicted from redshift surveys .",
    "also shown in this section are the recovered three - dimensional velocity field and the results of its analysis .",
    "our results are summarized and discussed in ",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in the present analysis , we use the enear redshift - distance survey described in greater detail in paper  i of this series .",
    "briefly , the enear sample consists of roughly 1600 early - type galaxies brighter than @xmath14 and with @xmath15 , for which distances are available for 1359 galaxies . of these",
    "1145 were deemed suitable for peculiar velocity analysis according to well - defined criteria ( paper  i ; m. alonso , in preparation ) . to the magnitude - limited sample we added 285 fainter and/or with redshifts @xmath16 , 129 within the same volume as the magnitude - limited sample . in total ,",
    "the cluster sample consists of 569 galaxies in 28 clusters , which are used to derive the distance relation ( m. bernardi , in preparation ) . over 80% of the galaxies in the magnitude - limited sample and roughly 60% of the cluster galaxies",
    "have new spectroscopic and r - band photometric data obtained as part of this program .",
    "furthermore , repeated observations of several galaxies in the sample ( m. alonso , in preparation ; g. wegner 2000 ) provide overlaps between observations conducted with different telescope / instrument configurations and with data available from other authors .",
    "these overlaps are used to tie all measurements into a common system , thereby ensuring the homogeneity of the entire dataset .",
    "in contrast to other samples new observations conducted by the same group are available over the entire sky .",
    "the comparison between the sample of galaxies with distances and the parent catalog also shows that the sampling across the sky is uniform .",
    "individual galaxy distances were estimated from a direct template relation derived by combining all the available cluster data ( m. bernardi , in preparation ) , corrected for incompleteness and associated diameter - bias ( lynden - bell 1988 ) . from the observed scatter of the template relation",
    "the estimated fractional error in the inferred distance of a galaxy is @xmath17 , nearly independent of the velocity dispersion .",
    "since early - type galaxies are found preferentially in high - density regions , galaxies have been assigned to groups / clusters using well - defined criteria imposed on their projected separation and velocity difference relative to the center of groups and clusters .",
    "these systems were identified using objective algorithms applied to the available magnitude - limited samples , comprising all morphological types , with complete redshift information probing the same volume . for membership assignment we used group catalogs published by geller & huchra ( 1983 ) , maia , da costa & latham ( 1988 ) , ramella , pisani & geller ( 1997 ) as well as unpublished results ( m. ramella , in preparation ) covering other regions of the sky . the characteristic size and velocity dispersion of these groups",
    "/ clusters were used to establish the membership of the enear early - types , as described in paper  i. we find isolated galaxies , groups with only one early - type , and groups with two or more early - types .",
    "early - type galaxies in a group / cluster are replaced by a single object having : ( 1 ) the redshift given by the group s mean redshift , which is determined considering all morphologies ; ( 2 ) the distance given by the error - weighted mean of the inferred distances , for groups with two or more early - types ; and ( 3 ) the fractional distance error given by @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the number of early - types in the group . in some cases groups were identified with abell / aco clusters within the same volume as the enear sample and fainter cluster galaxies were added , as described in paper  i. in the analysis below we compute the dipole component of the velocity field out to @xmath20 as probed by all objects , and by splitting the sample into two independent sub - samples consisting of field galaxies and groups / clusters .",
    "the latter is done to evaluate directly from data the amplitude of possible sampling errors .",
    "the inferred distances are corrected for the homogeneous and inhomogeneous malmquist bias ( imb ) .",
    "the latter was estimated using the pcsz density field ( branchini 1999 ) , corrected for the effects of peculiar velocities , in the expressions given by willick ( 1997 ) . in this caculation",
    "we also include the correction for the redshift limit of the sample .",
    "a complete account of the sample used and the corrections applied will be presented in a subsequent paper of this series ( m. alonso , in preparation ) .",

    "this is in marked contrast to the the results obtaine from the analysis of the mark iii survey which yields a much stronger tidal field , pointing ( in the sense of its quadrupole moment ) towards the shapley concentration .",
    "for mark iii the tidal field contributes roughly third of the total bulk velocity ( @xmath137km / s ) .",
    "( 8,10 ) ( -2,-.5 )",
    "in the first part of this paper the maximum - likelihood method ( zaroubi 1997 ) has been used to measure the mass - density power spectrum from the newly completed enear early  type redshift - distance survey .",
    "the method assumes that the galaxy peculiar velocities satisfy gaussian random statistics and that they are linearly related to the mass - density field .",
    "the initial fluctuation power spectrum is assumed to be cdm - like , with or without cobe normalizations . in addition",
    "the measured peculiar velocities error are assumed to be proportional to the distance with some thermal component to account for the nonlinear evolution of high - density environment in which the early  type galaxies reside .",
    "general results that are valid for all the models used in the analysis , and are independent of the detailed parameterization and normalization used in each model , can be summarized as follows .",
    "the amplitude of the power spectrum at @xmath103 is @xmath138 yielding @xmath139 .",
    "for the family of cobe - normalized cdm models the following range of parameters was considered : @xmath140 ; @xmath141 ; and @xmath73 . within this range",
    "we have obtained a constraint on a combination of the parameters @xmath35 and @xmath65 which can be approximated by @xmath142 for , and @xmath143 for . for @xmath144 ,  yields @xmath145 .",
    "similar constraints are obtained from the analysis of the generic @xmath6-models , independent of the cobe normalization .",
    "we find that the power spectrum amplitude and shape parameter are constrained to be @xmath146 and @xmath147 , with larger values of @xmath6 ( @xmath148 ) being more probable .",
    "we point out that these constraints are consistent with the results obtained from a similar analysis of the mark iii and the sfi peculiar velocity catalogs .",
    "this agreement is encouraging since it shows that the results are robust and independent of the sample used .",
    "examination of the @xmath107 for the most likely cobe - normalized models shows that their values are of the order of 0.93 .",
    "these values are about @xmath100 away from the preferred value of 1 .",
    "however , this should not be too alarming as many of the models within the errors have @xmath149 .",
    "the @xmath108 for the best - fit @xmath6-model is 0.99 .    as pointed out by previous papers that have analyzed the ps derived from peculiar velocity data ( zaroubi 1997 , freudling 1999 ) , the constraints on @xmath96 and @xmath6 are considerably higher than those obtained from other types of analyzes including peculiar velocity data ( borgani 1997 , 2000 ) , cluster abundances , and the galaxy power - spectrum ( efstathiou 1992 ; sutherland 1999 )",
    ". they are also not consitent with those obtained by combining the results from high redshift supernovae type ia ( perlmutter 1999 ) and the cmb data ( efstathiou 1999 ) which yields values of @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "furthermore , assuming a linear galaxy - mass relation the value of @xmath96 obtained from the present analysis would imply @xmath152 or a @xmath153 ( willmer , da costa & pellegrini 1999 ; sutherland 1999 ) , where the subscript refers to  galaxies , at least a factor of 2 larger than those derived from a velocity - velocity comparison of the  1.2 jy gravity field and the mark iii ( davis 1996 ) , sfi ( da costa 1998 ) and enear ( nusser 2000 ) all leading to @xmath154 .",
    "these values are also consistent with those derived from small - scale velocities ( fisher 1995 ) .",
    "there are many possible explanations for the above discrepancies .",
    "one possibility is that all other analyses have somehow conspired to produce consistent results but yet incorrect interpretation .",
    "even though at first glance this seems unlikely , the recent results from the cmb ballon experiments boomerang ( bernardis 2000 ; lange 2000 ) and maxima ( hanany 2000 ; balbi 2000 ) have shown that the height of the second peak in the cmb angular power - spectrum is consistent with higher values of @xmath35 . from their most likely models",
    "these authors derive @xmath155    it is important to point out that the method is very sensitive to the assumed error model which can add or supress power .",
    "it also implicitly gives a high weight to nearby galaxies , likely to be slow rotators or low velocity dispersion systems , for which the measurements and the distance relations are the least reliable .",
    "however , tests have shown that these effects are not very important for the present data set .",
    "another potential problem arises due to the rapid decrease of the weight with distance , the effective volume of the currently available catalogs is small and the shape of the power spectrum is poorly constrained , as illustrated by the case of the @xmath6-model .",
    "all these factors may impact on the reliability of the constraints obtained from the ps analysis .",
    "finally , one or more of the theoretical model ingredients could be inaccurate , , power spectrum assumed shapes , gaussianity of the distribution ; or even some inherent bias in the method itself that has eluded the extensive numerical tests carried out with the data and mock samples ( freduling 1999 ) .",
    "in fact , through an eigenmode expansion of the mark iii and sfi galaxy catalogs , hoffman and zaroubi ( 2000 ) have conducted a mode  by  mode goodness  of  fit analysis .",
    "they found that when the surveys are analyzed with their corresponding cdm most likely models , there is a systematic inconsistency between the data and the ` best - fit ' models suggesting either a generic problem in the peculiar velocity data sets or the inadequacy of the theoretical or error models .",
    "unfortunately , however , the analysis has not been able to point to the exact source of inconsistency .",
    "finally , in this study we have also performed , given the most probable power spectrum , a wiener reconstruction of the density and velocity fields .",
    "the maps shown here have @xmath126 and @xmath127 gaussian resolution and they are limited to the supergalactic plane .",
    "the main features shown are similar to the features in the reconstruction , corrected for perculiar velocities .",
    "the constrained realizations allow us to estimate the point - by - point uncertainties in the recovered maps . in terms of their recovered density fields",
    "enear , sfi and mark iii mostly agree . however , they do differ in the velocity fields .",
    "enear shows no significant tidal component which contributes about half of the mark iii local bulk velocity .",
    "this tidal field accounts for the very different bulk velocities obtained from enear and mark iii , with sfi situated in between these surveys .",
    "the results suggest that volumes of @xmath156 are essentially at rest relative to the cmb and that the local group motion is primarily due to mass fluctuations within the volume sampled by the existing catalogs of peculiar velocity data .",
