    "systems of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) continue to offer rich opportunities for exploring intrinsically quantum characteristics , such as superposition and entanglement , at the mesoscopic / macroscopic interface .",
    "models based on few bosonic modes have been widely studied .",
    "initially , a two - mode model of quantum tunneling between two wells , specifically the two - site bose - hubbard model , was sufficient to predict self - trapping phenomena @xcite which was subsequently confirmed experimentally @xcite .",
    "ensuing studies were extended to three - mode models to investigate , for example , dynamics @xcite , entanglement , @xcite , dissipation @xcite , quantum phase transitions @xcite , and condensate fragmentation @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of a four - well bose - hubbard model was studied in @xcite as a means to achieve mass transport and persistent currents around a loop . the same model , but with two significantly different tunneling rates , has been investigated in relation to a mesoscopic quantum system in thermal contact @xcite . the quantum dynamics for a range of different initial conditions , in terms of the particle number distribution among the wells and quantum statistics ,",
    "was presented in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it is claimed that an appropriate control of short - range and dipolar interaction may lead to the dynamical creation of mesoscopic quantum superposition , which could be employed in the design of heisenberg - limited atom interferometers through a four - well system .",
    "also , it has been proposed to implement a two - well model with two levels in each well ( yielding a four - mode model ) as a means to experimentally measure epr entanglement @xcite .",
    "the two - mode bose - hubbard model is an example of an integrable system which admits an exact bethe ansatz solution @xcite , the existence of which allows analytic computation of physical quantities .",
    "for example , a bethe ansatz solution of the model was used to calculate the ground - state one - body density matrix in the attractive regime @xcite .",
    "this calculation shows the existence of a quantum phase transition point of the model which is characterized as separating condensate fragmentation from an unfragmented phase .",
    "it is desirable from this perspective to also identify integrable cases of similar models with higher number of modes .",
    "this is the objective of our work here for the case of a four - well model .    in sect .",
    "2 we define the model and set up the notational conventions . sect . 3",
    "is devoted to deriving the model via the quantum inverse scattering method , and deriving an exact solution through the algebraic bethe ansatz @xcite . here",
    "we encounter some unusual properties for this model .",
    "one is that although we can identify four conserved operators for the system , only two of them are obtained through the transfer matrix produced by the quantum inverse scattering method .",
    "another curiosity is that there are multiple pseudovacuum states available for the purposes of implementing the algebraic bethe ansatz .",
    "a consequence of this is that there is a class of eigenstates which admit a simple , closed - form energy expression .",
    "numerical studies undertaken in sect .",
    "4 indicate that all pseudovacua are required in order to obtain a complete set of bethe eigenstates .",
    "concluding comments are given in sect .",
    "the four - well model we present has the hamiltonian @xmath0 the operators @xmath1 denote the single - particle creation and annihilation operators acting in the four wells , with @xmath2 providing the number operator for bosons in well @xmath3 .",
    "the quantities @xmath4 which determine the tunneling couplings are not independent but take a factorised form @xmath5 where the set @xmath6 are arbitrary real variables .",
    "this is equivalent to the constraint @xmath7 but still admits sufficient freedom to investigate a range of anisotropic tunneling regimes .",
    "the coupling parameters @xmath8 , which controls on - site and inter - well interactions between bosons , and @xmath9 , which is an external potential parameter , are also arbitrary real variables .    the total number operator @xmath10 is a conserved operator commuting with the hamiltonian .",
    "for each fixed value of @xmath11 the dimension of the associated hilbert space @xmath12 is @xmath13 later will show that there are two additional constants of the motion , which leads to the conclusion that the hamiltonian is integrable . in fig .",
    "[ esquema ] we show a schematic representation for the model .    physically , the hamiltonian ( [ h4 ] ) models anisotropic josephson tunneling for a bose - einstein condensate confined in a four - well ring potential .",
    "this hamiltonian differs from the usual bose - hubbard model @xcite by the inclusion of interactions terms of the form @xmath14 .",
    "however these quadratic interactions are found in other models , e.g. @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of the external potential term @xmath15 , which has an analogue in the case of the two - mode bose - hubbard model @xcite , is compatible with the integrability .",
    "there are rich mathematical structures associated to this model , including an exact bethe ansatz solution which will be derived below .",
    "our first objective is to establish that the hamiltonian ( [ h4 ] ) can be obtained through the quantum inverse scattering method .",
    "we follow the general approach of @xcite , which itself extends ideas presented in @xcite .",
    "we begin with the standard @xmath16-invariant @xmath17-matrix , depending on the spectral parameter @xmath18 : @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 . above",
    ", @xmath22 is a free real parameter .",
    "it is well - known that @xmath23 satisfies the yang ",
    "baxter equation @xcite @xmath24 here @xmath25 denotes the matrix acting non - trivially on the @xmath26-th and @xmath27-th spaces and as the identity on the remaining space .",
    "we start with the lax operator @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the identity operator and @xmath30 since @xmath31 satisfies the yang - baxter equation @xmath32 we can define a monodromy matrix from the yang - baxter realization presented above as @xmath33 where @xmath34 it follows that the monodromy matrix satisfies the yang - baxter equation @xmath35 finally , we define the transfer matrix @xmath36 where @xmath37 and the following identification has been made for the coupling constants : @xmath38    it follows from ( [ yba ] ) that the transfer matrix commutes for different values of the spectral parameter , @xmath39=0,\\ ] ] and consequently the eigenvectors of @xmath40 are independent of @xmath18 .",
    "it is now straightforward to check that the hamiltonian ( [ h4 ] ) is related to the transfer matrix @xmath40 ( [ tm ] ) through @xmath41 therefore the energy spectrum is given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 denotes the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix . to find expressions for these eigenvalues we apply the algebraic bethe ansatz procedure @xcite .",
    "to apply the algebraic bethe ansatz method we have to determine suitable pseudovacua . to accomplish this",
    "we define the commuting operators @xmath44 which satisfy @xmath45    let @xmath46 denote the bosonic vacuum state defined by the property @xmath47 for the purposes of the algebraic bethe ansatz calculation the pseudovacua are given by @xmath48 and satisfy @xmath49 now we can define the bethe states associated to each pseudovacuum as @xmath50 using the following algebraic relations @xmath51 which are determined from ( [ yba ] ) , the algebraic bethe ansatz @xcite can be applied .",
    "in particular it is found that @xmath52 where for @xmath53 the transfer matrix eigenvalues are given by @xmath54 while for @xmath55 the eigenvalues are given by @xmath56 and the parameters @xmath57 are solutions of the bethe ansatz equations @xmath58 these eigenvalue formulae allow for the energy spectrum to be computed through ( [ nrg ] ) .",
    "we remark that in the case when @xmath53 the expression ( [ nrg ] ) reduces to the simple form @xmath59 eq .",
    "( [ nrg1 ] ) is notable for two reasons .",
    "first it shows that there is a class of eigenstates which admit a simple , closed - form energy eigenvalue .",
    "the second is that for these eigenstates the energy eigenvalue is independent of the variables @xmath4 .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ h4 ] ) is a model with four bosonic modes , for which it is expected that integrability requires at least four independent conserved operators .",
    "however , the quantum inverse scattering method applied above shows that we obtain only two independent conserved operators , @xmath60 and @xmath11 , from the transfer matrix .",
    "nonetheless there exists two other independent conserved operators with the form @xmath61 these operators satisfy the commutation relations @xmath62=0,\\;\\;\\;\\;[h , q_{1,3}]=[h , q_{2,4}]=[n , q_{1,3}]=[n , q_{2,4}]=0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so @xmath63 and @xmath64 together with the hamiltonian @xmath60 and the total boson number operator @xmath11 provide four independent conserved operators for the model .",
    "moreover , the additional conserved operators satisfy the following commutation relations @xmath65=[q_{2,4 } , c(u)]=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it follows that each bethe state @xmath66 as defined above is a simultaneous eigenstate of the additional conserved operators : @xmath67",
    "finally we undertake a numerical analysis to demonstrate that ( at least in some instances ) utilizing all possible pseudovacua in the bethe ansatz procedure allows for a complete set of energy levels to be obtained .      by using the normalized fock basis @xmath69 for the sector @xmath70",
    ", the hamiltonian takes the matrix form @xmath71 choosing the parameter values @xmath72 and diagonalizing this matrix , we find that the eigenvalues are given by @xmath73 the next step is to compute the spectrum from the bethe ansatz equations .",
    "choosing @xmath74 then ( [ identify ] ) imposes the parameter values @xmath75 for the @xmath70 sector there are three pseudovacua .",
    "* @xmath76 : this pseudovacuum leads to the bethe ansatz equation @xmath77 which has two solutions @xmath78 using ( [ nrg ] ) , this yields @xmath79 in agreement with @xmath80 and @xmath81 obtained by numerical diagonalization . *",
    "@xmath82 : here the pseudovacuum is an eigenvector of the hamiltonian and through ( [ nrg1 ] ) we obtain @xmath83 which is in agreement with @xmath84 obtained by numerical diagonalization . * @xmath85 : here the pseudovacuum is an eigenvector of the hamiltonian and through ( [ nrg1 ] ) we obtain @xmath86 which is in agreement with @xmath87 obtained by numerical diagonalization .      by using the normalized fock basis @xmath89 for the sector @xmath90 , the hamiltonian takes the matrix form @xmath91    again choosing the parameter values ( [ param1 ] ) to diagonalize the matrix we find that the eigenvalues are given by @xmath92 to compare these results with those obtained from the bethe ansatz equations , we again make the identifications given by ( [ alfas ] ) and ( [ param2 ] ) . for this sector",
    "we have six pseudovacua .",
    "* @xmath76 : the pseudovacuum leads to the bethe anastz equations @xmath93 which admits the solutions @xmath94 as well as the spurious solutions sets @xmath95 which must be discarded since the roots coincide ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) . applying ( [ nrg ] ) we find @xmath96 in agreement with @xmath97 and @xmath98 obtained by numerical diagonalization . *",
    "@xmath99 : this pseudovacuum leads to the bethe ansatz equation @xmath100 the solutions are @xmath101 which produces the energy eigenvalues @xmath102 agreeing with @xmath87 and @xmath103 obtained by numerical diagonalization .",
    "* @xmath104 : associated with this pseudovacuum there is the bethe ansatz equation @xmath105 with solutions @xmath106 these solutions provide the energy eigenvalues @xmath107 corresponding to @xmath84 and @xmath108 obtained by numerical diagonalization . *",
    "@xmath109 : here the pseudovacuum is an eigenvector of the hamiltonian and through ( [ nrg1 ] ) we obtain @xmath110 which is in agreement with @xmath111 obtained by numerical diagonalization . * @xmath112 : again the pseudovacuum is an eigenvector of the hamiltonian and through ( [ nrg1 ] ) we obtain @xmath113 which is in agreement with @xmath81 obtained by numerical diagonalization . * @xmath114 : again the pseudovacuum is an eigenvector of the hamiltonian and through ( [ nrg1 ] ) we obtain @xmath115 which is in agreement with @xmath116 obtained by numerical diagonalization .",
    "our numerical investigations suggest that for @xmath117 fixed , there are @xmath118 sets of bethe ansatz equations ( [ bae ] ) each admitting @xmath119 non - spurious solutions .",
    "moreover , when @xmath120 there are @xmath121 pseudovacuum states which are eigenstates of the hamiltonian .",
    "this implies that the total number of bethe states for fixed @xmath11 is @xmath122 thus for generic values of the coupling parameters we expect that the bethe ansatz solution of this model is complete , analogous to other exactly solved models where this property has been established @xcite .",
    "our main objective was to establish an exact bethe ansatz solution for the four - well hamiltonian ( [ h4 ] ) .",
    "this was achieved by first formulating the model through the quantum inverse scattering method .",
    "it was found that the model admits multiple pseudovacuum states , and for each of these there is a set of bethe ansatz equations given by ( [ bae ] ) . introducing new variables @xmath123 then ( [ bae ] )",
    "assumes the form @xmath124 at this point we recognise ( [ baenew ] ) as the bethe ansatz equations for the two - mode bose - hubbard model @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the eigenspectrum of the four - well hamiltonian ( [ h4 ] ) is in one - to - one correspondence with the eigenspectrum of a particular _ ensemble _ of two - well hamiltonians , with particle numbers and coupling parameters dependent on the eigenvalues @xmath27 and @xmath125 of the additional conserved operators as given by ( [ cons1 ] ) and ( [ cons2 ] ) .",
    "this opens a path of investigation into the four - well model by utilizing results known for the two - well model .",
    "this approach will be developed in future work , with particular focus on characterizing the ground - state properties of the four - well model .",
