    "a central problem of the theory of nuclear reactions is to find the interaction potential between the colliding nuclei that can describe a wide range of scattering data and provide the wave functions required .",
    "such a potential is not simply the result of mapping data to a convenient functional form .",
    "rather , it has an underlying physical basis in that it is related to the nucleon ",
    "nucleon interaction as well as to the structure and dynamics of the interacting nuclei .    for practical reasons",
    ", it is desirable to express this potential in terms of quite simple analytic and local form with parameters adjusted to fit a set of scattering data .",
    "the phenomenological optical model potentials @xcite are of this class .",
    "the most commonly used form is that of a woods  saxon shape and for light nuclei that of a gaussian .",
    "as these potentials fit the scattering cross section well , the relevant scattering wave function is asymptotically correct .",
    "such potentials , however , do not guarantee that their off ",
    "shell characteristics are sufficiently good to describe equally well reactions that depend on the behaviour of the wave function in the interior region .",
    "such reactions are , for example , the electro  disintegration and photo  disintegration processes which depend crucially on the wave function at all distances .",
    "when a nucleus  nucleus interaction is constructed theoretically directly from a nucleon  nucleon potential , it is usually nonlocal and quite complicated .",
    "such potentials can be obtain , for example , by using the resonating group method ( rgm ) in which the inter  cluster interaction is constructed via the pauli antisymmetrization @xcite . to study the resulting nonlocalities one resorts to a construction of an equivalent local potential ( elp ) using various methods . in this way certain off  shell characteristics of the interaction can be revealed .",
    "for instance , the use of fiedeldey s wronskian method @xcite to construct an energy dependent elp for the nucleon@xmath1 rgm nonlocal interaction revealed a repulsion in the interaction region @xcite which suggests the possible existence of resonances .",
    "another way of constructing local nucleus ",
    "nucleus potentials is the use of inverse scattering techniques .",
    "the potential in this case is directly related to the available information of the scattering phase shifts and of bound states . in the inverse scattering method at a specific partial wave @xmath2 ( fixed@xmath2 inversion )",
    "@xcite and in the absence of bound states , the constructed potential is unique .",
    "however , when bound states are present one may construct an infinite number of potentials which are spectrum and phase equivalent at all energies .",
    "this is achieved by choosing arbitrarily the bound states normalization constants which are not available from experiments . however , as we shall show in this paper , the asymptotic normalization constants determine the distribution of resonances in the @xmath0plane and vice versa .",
    "this emphasizes the importance of taking resonances into account in constructing effective interactions which are usually ignored .",
    "one of the main reasons for omitting the resonances is the lack of experimental information on their positions and widths especially for broad resonances . in the past",
    "this was aggravated by the absence of an exact and yet simple method to study the analytical properties of the corresponding amplitude which could facilitate their incorporation into the potential construction .",
    "recently , however , a new method for direct calculation of the jost function in the complex @xmath0plane , has been developed @xcite . within this method ,",
    "the bound , resonant , and scattering states can be found by locating the jost function zeros in the appropriate domain of the @xmath0plane .",
    "it is based on a combination of the complex coordinate rotation with the variable  constant method used to replace the schrdinger equation by an equivalent system of linear first ",
    "order differential equations .",
    "since this method is both exact and quite simple , it could be used , together with the fitting of phase shifts , to construct a realistic potential which reproduces resonance poles as well .",
    "complex rotation of the coordinate requires knowledge of the potential off the real axis in the @xmath3plane .",
    "this poses no problem when the potential is given in an analytic form .",
    "however , there are cases , such as the aforementioned inverse scattering method , in which the resulting potential is given as a tabulated set of values versus radial points . in this paper",
    ", we show how the jost function method of refs .",

    "the conventions and a method to evaluate these @xmath22 constants are described in appendix a. the rational parametrization of the @xmath9matrix reduces the marchenko inverse scattering procedure to an algebraic problem since the kernel of eq .",
    "( [ march ] ) becomes separable ; this can easily be seen if one performs the integration in eq .",
    "( [ frr ] ) using the residue method .    in the absence of bound states",

    "i.e. _ , once a good fit to the data from @xmath23 is achieved , one and only one potential can be obtained . in the presence of bound states , however , the potential is not unique as it depends on the choice of the asymptotic normalization constants @xmath24 which are not provided by experiment .",

    "any other choice can lead to an equivalent local potential which reproduces the same on  shell data but it has different shape and range .    from eq .",

    "the jost function thus constructed approximates well the exact jost function on a segment of the real axis of the @xmath0plane . from this one",
    "should expect that it would be a good approximation off the real axis as well .",
    "indeed , if two analytical functions coincide on any arc of a continuous curve , they coincide everywhere in the region of their analyticity @xcite .",
    "there are at least two problems concerning such a parametrization .",
    "firstly , the function ( [ f1 ] ) actually does not coincide with the exact jost function on the real axis but can only be a good numerical approximation at certain points .",
    "how fast the deviations are growing when one moves away from the real axis is not known . secondly , since instead of an infinite number of terms in eq .",
    "( [ f1 ] ) , we have to truncate the product to a finite number of terms , not all @xmath28 correspond to zeros of the exact jost function . in other words , the fitting procedure employed to evaluate these parameters , may generates a number of unphysical zeros and poles which could be simply an artifact of the truncation .",
    "the inter ",
    "cluster interaction in nuclear physics is usually characterized by a repulsion at short distances .",
    "alternatively , the potential can be made deep enough to sustain deep bound states which simulate the role of the so - called pauli forbidden states ( pfs ) appearing in the rgm theory which are not physical .",
    "this means that the levinson s theorem , @xmath29 , is fulfilled for this system .",
    "these states , however , pose a problem when the potential is intended for used in few ",
    "body calculations as they generate a scattering amplitude with different off ",
    "shell characteristics .",
    "thus one resorts to the removal of the pfs using a subtraction technique @xcite that results in a shallow potential . a rigorous relation between deep and shallow potentials ,",
    "however , has been established by baye @xcite by using two successive susy transformations , the first in order to remove the ground state and the second to restore phase equivalence . alternatively",
    "the ground state can be removed using the marchenko inverse scattering method and assigning a zero value to the corresponding asymptotic normalization constant .",
    "the resulting potential is also unique @xcite coinciding with the one obtained from susy transformations .",
    "in what follows , the main equations of the supersymmetric transformation will be briefly recalled ( details can be found , for example , in refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the supersymmetric transformation of a given potential @xmath30 that has an undesirable ground state at @xmath31 , results in a phase  equivalent potential @xmath32 which does not sustain this state .",
    "two consecutive transformations , @xmath33 are required for this purpose .",
    "the first one eliminates the ground state of the original potential , but also changes the phase shifts .",
    "phase equivalence is then restored by a second susy transformation .",
    "the first step of the transformation ( [ twosteps ] ) , @xmath34 requires the normalized wave function @xmath35 of the ground state to be removed .",
    "the second step is implemented via @xmath36\\ , \\ ] ] where the wave function @xmath37 is the solution of the schrdinger equation with the potential @xmath38 at the same energy @xmath39 and has the asymptotic behaviour @xmath40 the well  known @xmath41 behaviour of the transformed potential @xmath42 at short distances can easily be deduced from eq .",
    "( [ secondstep ] ) . indeed , both wave functions @xmath35 and @xmath37 near the origin have the behaviour @xmath43 with some integer @xmath44 , which makes the second term of this equation proportional to @xmath45 .",
    "finally , we note that the susy potentials are intrinsically related to inverse scattering theory @xcite which can be used to generate energy  independent shallow potentials from energy ",
    "dependent deep potentials @xcite . for this , one has to calculate first the phase shifts at all energies and then employ the marchenko scheme to construct an @xmath2dependent potential from which a unique shallow potential can be obtained either by super transforming twice or , as mentioned earlier , by assuming that the corresponding asymptotic normalization constant is zero .",
    "the method we employ here for locating potential resonances belongs to the class of so - called complex energy methods which are based on a rigorous definition of resonances , namely , as zeros of the jost function . unlike most of the other methods of this class , which involve an expansion of the resonant wave function in terms of square  integrable functions",
    ", our method is based on a direct calculation of the jost function at complex @xmath0 by integrating exact differential equations equivalent to the schrdinger equation .    by locating a complex zero @xmath46 of the jost function in the fourth quadrant of the momentum plane ,",

    "( [ fpmeq ] ) , @xmath62 with a sufficiently large @xmath63 .",
    "the above scheme works extremely well in locating bound , scattering , and resonant states as well in finding regge poles and trajectories when the potential @xmath4 is central , short range and it is given in analytic form .",
    "a generalization to non ",
    "central , multi  channel , and coulomb  tailed as well as to singular potentials can be found in refs .",
    "however , in this work we are concerned with potentials given in a tabular form and the question of how to handle such potentials will be discussed when presenting our results .",
    "in the present work the potentials were generated either by inversion or by susy transformations and hence in both cases they are available in a tabular form . to make an analytic continuation of them into the first quadrant of the complex @xmath3plane , needed for the complex rotation",
    ", we fitted the potentials on the real axis by simple analytical forms with adjustable parameters and then considered @xmath3 in these forms as a complex variable .",
    "such an approach to analytic continuation is based on a theorem of the complex analysis which states that if a function is analytic in a region and vanishes along any arc of a continuous curve in this region , then it must vanish identically in this region @xcite .",
    "the obvious corollary of this theorem is that if two functions coincide on a curve , they coincide everywhere in the region of analyticity .",
    "therefore , the analytical form which coincides with the tabulated function on the real axis should reproduce this function off the real axis as well .",
    "the question then arises what if the potentials coincide within numerics . in other words",
    ", we want to know whether small numerical deviations in the potential on the real axis generate perceptible deviations of the position of the resonances .",
    "we have investigated this situation first by assuming the following analytic potential @xmath64 - 8\\exp(-0.2r^2 ) \\label{som0}\\ ] ] where the strength parameters are given in mev and @xmath3 in fm .",
    "the reduced mass @xmath65 is such that @xmath66mev@xmath67 .",

    "the minimization was stopped when the least square error on 120 points and @xmath71 and @xmath72 was of the order of 10@xmath73  a typical accuracy in these cases .",
    "this means that the fit to the analytic potential was between the third and fourth decimal in the whole region .",
    "with such a fit , all resonances found in ref .",
    "@xcite were recovered within three to five decimal points . for comparison ,",
    "the energies and widths for few of them ( the lowest resonances in each partial wave ) are given in table [ recov ] .",
    "obviously the accuracy can be improved as the fit to the potential improves .",
    "one further comment is necessary : the form factors used for the fit restrict the use of a rotation to only a certain region . in this respect",
    "the use of splines is not suitable at all as they diverge for all angles of rotation .",
    "these test calculations show that the jost function method based on the complex rotation of the coordinate , is applicable and retains its effectiveness even when the potential is given numerically on the real axis .",
    "we can therefore use it to study the importance of incorporating physical two ",
    "cluster resonances in constructing a potential .",
    "this can be easily investigated by constructing elp s for a specific partial wave via inversion as described above and studying the implications of the implanted resonances . for this",
    "we use the nucleon@xmath1 potential of dubovichenko and dzhazairov ",
    "kakhramanov @xcite for the @xmath74 partial wave @xmath75 where @xmath76mev and @xmath77@xmath78 .",
    "this is a deep potential that sustains an unphysical pfs state at @xmath79mev .",
    "this means that the levinson s theorem , @xmath29 , is fulfilled for this system . at large distances",
    "the radial wave function decays exponentially , @xmath80 and the asymptotic normalization constant was found to be @xmath81 .    by varying the asymptotic normalization constant we obtained a set of potentials which were fully phase shift and bound state equivalent but have different number of potential resonances .",
    "these potentials are shown in fig .",
    "it is seen that for values of @xmath82 less than the choice given by ( [ asym1 ] ) ( @xmath83 ) , a hump appears in the interaction region which is higher as @xmath82 becomes smaller while at the same time the well becomes deeper . for values larger than 6.1603",
    "the potential is also of long range but without a hump . in the extreme case of @xmath84",
    "the potential becomes repulsive at all distances .",
    "this means that as @xmath85 resonances are generated and their appearance and position depend on the specific choice of @xmath82 .    using the ansatz ( [ sum1 ] ) we fitted these potentials , with @xmath71 and @xmath86 , via the merlin code @xcite the accuracy being again within a fourth decimal at all points meaning that corresponding accuracy in reproducing the phase shifts was better than 0.0001 of a degree .",
    "we employed the analytical representations of these phase ",
    "equivalent potentials to locate the zeros of the jost function in the fourth quadrant of the @xmath0plane . the original potential ( [ dubo ] ) , which is also a member of our set of the phase  equivalent potentials , does not generate any physical resonances .",
    "all the zeros of the jost function , which we found for this potential , are situated below the diagonal of the fourth quadrant of the @xmath0plane and , therefore , represent sub  threshold resonances which are unphysical .",
    "the growth of the potential barrier when @xmath82 decreases , indicates that some physical resonances should appear .",
    "in other words , when @xmath82 becomes smaller some of the jost function zeros should move up to the area above the threshold line .",
    "when , however , @xmath82 is too small , the barrier transforms into a strong repulsive core , and the resonances should disappear .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ a3a2a1 ] where we present the distributions of the jost function zeros for three phase ",
    "equivalent potentials corresponding to @xmath82 equal to 3 , 2 and 1 .",
    "it is clear that the choice of @xmath82 determines positions of the resonances and vice versa .    at a first sight",
    "one can argue that the zeros of the jost function practically have no effect on the scattering processes because they are far away from the real axis .",
    "these potentials , however , generate bound and scattering wave functions which have a different behaviour in the interior region .",

    "the nodeless wave function for the susy potential @xmath88 is also shown in the latter .",
    "since the interior region ( within few fm ) is of importance in describing various nuclear reactions , the existence and distribution of resonances can not be ignored when the reaction observables are calculated .",
    "these differences are also a source of off shell differences in the corresponding scattering matrices which are manifested in three and four  cluster calculations .    as another example , we consider the @xmath1@xmath1 local potential of buck _ et al . _",

    "the position of the resonance is quite different from the values of 92.12@xmath970.05kev and @xmath98ev given by buck _",
    "a possible reason for such a discrepancy is that in locating these spectral points we included the coulomb tail of the second term of eq .",
    "( [ buckpot ] ) in an exact way as was proposed in refs .",
    "we are interested about the movement of this resonance when we eliminate one of the unphysical bound states using the susy transformation . to this end",

    ", we found a zero of the @xmath9wave jost function at @xmath102@xmath93 ( _ i.e. _ at @xmath103mev ) which is significantly different from the position of the @xmath9wave resonance given in table  [ bucktable ] . in view of the above discussion this is not surprising since the susy transformation drastically changes the asymptotic normalization constant for the ground state , to zero",
    "we demonstrated that for a potential given numerically the analytic properties of the corresponding jost function in the complex @xmath0plane can be obtained via fitting the potential by any analytic form that allows a complex rotation into the first quadrant of the complex @xmath3plane .",
    "the scattering observables , the bound states , and the potential resonances can be calculated with a sufficient accuracy which is improved with an improved fit to the potential .",
    "the phase shifts and therefore the on - shell @xmath9matrix which are extracted from experimental data on the real @xmath0axis , contain information about resonances in an indirect way .",
    "the phase - shifts `` feel '' the existence of resonances only when they are close to the real axis ( narrow resonances ) .",
    "the broad resonances , however , remain `` unnoticed '' by the phase - shifts and therefore a potential which is based on them , generates an @xmath9matrix without the corresponding poles .",
    "however , even extremely broad resonances affect the behaviour of the physical wave function at short distances .",
    "this implies that an information on the distribution of resonances can be a clue for making a correct choice among very different potentials generating the same phase - shifts and the same on - shell @xmath9matrix .",
    "such information can , in principle , be obtained from various inelastic processes .",
    "for example , photo - excitation of a nucleus and its subsequent decay in two fragments @xmath104 and @xmath105 can reveal @xmath106resonances which are not `` visible '' in elastic @xmath106scattering . when an effective potential is constructed using not experimental but theoretical phase ",
    "shifts , additional effort to locate broad resonances would exclude ambiguities ( non - uniqueness ) of the effective potential .",
    "this is the case , for example , with the rgm theory which can produce very complicated ( nonlocal ) potentials . to apply such a potential in realistic calculations ,",
    "one usually calculates rgm phase - shifts and , using them , constructs a simple effective ( phase - equivalent ) potential .    in summary ,",
    "when constructing a realistic effective interaction , it is important to take into account physical resonances . in the case of an energy and @xmath2independent potential ,",
    "the resonances at all partial wave must be incorporated .",
