    "this paper recounts the results of a project to simulate the structure of decagonal quasicrystal aluminum - nickel - cobalt @xmath2(alconi ) in the `` basic co '' ( cobalt rich ) phase purely from energy minimization principles . of the equilibrium decagonal quasicrystals , @xmath2(alconi )",
    "has ( in some of its modifications ) the highest structural quality and has received the most study .",
    "studies of the phase diagram indicate that , e.g. , decagonal @xmath2(al@xmath3co@xmath4ni@xmath5 ) is stable ( at higher temperatures only ) , whereas @xmath2(alco ) is metastable only  @xcite .",
    "recently , a computational approach was proposed for discovering the atomic structure of any decagonal quasicrystal , given no information except a set of pair potentials , the quasilattice constant , and the periodic lattice constant ; it was applied first to @xmath2(alconi ) in the `` basic ni '' phase ;  @xcite . in the study described here ( and briefly reported elsewhere  @xcite ) ,",
    "the same approach is applied to `` basic co '' for the first time , and shown to work . as in the `` basic ni '' case ,",
    "our final structure description is in terms of a supertiling with a large quasilattice constant , but here different clusters and tiles enter than in the `` basic ni '' case .    since the sensitivity of the structure to the precise composition is one of the issues in this paper ( e.g. in sec .",
    "[ sec : bni - compare ] ) , and since known structures of crystalline `` approximant '' phases greatly illuminated our understanding of the related quasicrystals in the past , we shall pause to review what is known in the al - co - ni phase diagram .",
    "the decagonal portion of the al - co - ni phase diagram is fragmented into several modifications occupying small domains .",
    "@xcite . of these ,",
    "those showing the simplest diffraction patterns are the so - called `` basic nickel '' phase near the ni - rich composition al@xmath6co@xmath7ni@xmath8 and so - called `` basic cobalt '' near the co - rich composition al@xmath6co@xmath8ni@xmath7 .",
    "several high - resolution x - ray structure determinations were carried out for the `` basic ni '' phase  @xcite , but studies of the `` basic co '' phase have lagged .",
    "an interesting aspect of the co - rich portion of the phase diagram is the fivefold ( rather than tenfold ) symmetric decagonal phase ,  @xcite .",
    "in particular @xmath2(al@xmath3co@xmath8ni@xmath9 and @xmath2(al@xmath3co@xmath10ni@xmath11  @xcite , also @xmath2(al@xmath12co@xmath13ni@xmath14 )  @xcite .",
    "this and other co - rich modifications show superstructure diffraction peaks , indicating modulations of the `` basic '' structure : @xmath2(al@xmath3co@xmath15ni@xmath7 ) , similar to the `` fivefold '' modification  @xcite , and @xmath2(al@xmath16co@xmath8ni@xmath17 ) , which has a period of 61 in one direction and thus was called the `` one - dimensional quasicrystal ''  @xcite . throughout the phase diagram ,",
    "the _ quasilattice constant _",
    "@xmath18 is close to @xmath19 .",
    "there is a solved periodic crystal approximant of `` basic co '' , @xmath1(alconi ) structure  @xcite .",
    "there are further modifications near to the `` basic ni '' composition as well as near @xmath2(al@xmath6co@xmath20ni@xmath20 , and another ( partially solved ) approximant  @xcite , with unit cell @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 , and composition al@xmath16co@xmath24ni@xmath24 .",
    "the `` basic co '' phase has a @xmath25 stacking period , like `` basic ni '' , but it shows much stronger diffuse scattering than `` basic ni '' , @xcite in such a way as to indicate a local doubling of the @xmath26 periodicity ( to @xmath27 ) ; the known large approximants also have @xmath0 . [",
    "later in this paper ( sec .",
    "[ sec : doubled ] ) , we shall address the stabilizing effects of this period doubling . ]",
    "our general technique is the same as those used in the previous work on `` basic ni '' .",
    "we begin with a small - scale rhombus tiling and discover general motifs and patterns .",
    "these patterns usually have a geometry consistent with an inflated penrose tiling : we define a new model using that tiling , and the patterns observed at the small scale are promoted to be fundamental objects on the inflated tiling . by restricting configurations and increasing the size of fundamental objects , we can run simulations on larger and larger unit cells without excess degrees of freedom , speeding up the mmc process considerably .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . after reviewing the technique and the information needed in its set - up ( sec .",
    "[ sec : set - up ] ) , we present initial results in sec .",
    "[ sec : fixed - site ] from monte carlo lattice - gas simulations using a discrete site - list , both with the initial edge-@xmath18 rhombi and also with @xmath28-edge bilayer rhombi ; in particular , the whole structure is built from two cluster modifs ",

    "next , sec .",
    "[ sec : ideal - deco ] codifies this by describing an ideal decoration , which requires specification of the   orientations as well as the optimum placement of a subset of easily moved al atoms .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : relax ] , we pass on to molecular dynamics and relaxation studies that break free of the discrete - site lists ; these reveal troughs ( which we call `` channels '' ) in the potential energies felt by al atoms which lead to local disruption of the layering of the atoms , and a breaking of the two - layer peridiocity assumed in previous sections . here and in secs .",
    "[ sec : declro ] and [ sec : puckerlro ] , we take up the correlations in the atoms displacements , and also how this determines the an ordering of the orientations of   clusters which reduces the system s symmetry to pentagonal .",
    "we conclude with an application to w(alconi ) , the best - known approximant of co - rich quasicrystal @xmath2(alconi ) , in sec .",
    "[ sec : w ] , and a discussion ( sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] ) of the key results and the limits on their validity .",
    "in this section , we lay out the procedures of the simulation , as well as the assumptions and facts that all our results depend on .",
    "our methods are a combination of metropolis monte carlo ( mmc ) , relaxation , and molecular dynamics ( md ) .",
    "we first perform mmc on a set of fixed sites .",
    "we create this set by make use of a _ tiling _ of penrose rhombi on each layer and by placing atomic sites on each of the rhombi using a _",
    "decoration_. fig .",
    "[ fig : tileflips ] shows penrose rhombi and two decorations that we use .",
    "[ see appendix  [ app : code ] for a more detailed description of the decoration and tiling . ]",
    "penrose rhombus tilings ( even random ones ) have a natural inflation rule whereby the same space can be retiled with rhombi whose edges are a power of the golden ratio @xmath29 multiplied by the orginal edge length . in this paper , we will make use of rhombi with edges @xmath30 , @xmath313.96 , and @xmath3210.4 ; we shall also mention a similar tiling with edges @xmath33 that applies to the ni - rich @xmath2(alnico ) phase , a structure closely related to the one we are investigating .",
    "a unit cell can be tiled in many different ways with the same number of penrose rhombi ; this is physically important since the different tilings correspond to many different configurations of atomic sites that are consistent with the same physical cell and the assumptions based on the lattice constants . to explore this degree of freedom",
    ", we perform mmc on the rhombic tiles by using rearrangements of three penrose rhombi ( and the atoms on them ) that preserve their collective hexagon outline .",
    "the two rhombus configurations for which this is possible are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tileflips ] .",
    " , can be flipped with respect to their asymmetric axes as a way to move sites around . , width=163 ]    the mmc is performed on a temperature schedule specified by the beginning and ending inverse temperatures @xmath34 along with an inverse temperature step @xmath35 . at each temperature step ,",
    "a set number of mmc operations per site are performed .",
    "after we find a configuration with this `` fixed - site '' method , we can remove the site list restriction , and use relaxation and md to find a structure that is more energetically favorable by our potentials .",
    "why is our method to start with tilings , decorations , and discrete sites , and iterate this ( as outlined in the introduction ) , rather than immediately perform md ?",
    "the reason is that the energy surface of @xmath2(alconi ) in configuration space contains many local energy minima",
    ". a pure md program would be almost certain to be trapped in a glassy configuration .",
    "[ even with a small number of atoms and a simpler set of potentials , extremely long md coolings were necessary in order to produce recognizable ( but still quite defective ) quasicrystals by brute force .",
    "@xcite ]      the only experimental inputs into the procedure are lattice constants , composition , and and density ; the only theoretical input is the pair potentials . for the initial trials",
    ", one must also make a discrete choice of which size of rhombus to use  the quasilattice constant of a decagonal tiling is defined only modulo factors of @xmath36 and one must decide how many atomic layers are to be simulated .      .",
    "pair potential minima @xmath37 for al - co - ni .",
    "the `` ( 0 ) '' well is the hard core radius , defined as the minimum radius actually found in a relaxation ( after molecular dynamics annealing ) of an example configuration ; @xmath38 is defined by @xmath39ev .",
    "minima are listed only for @xmath400.025  ev . [ cols=\"<,>,^,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this appendix , we compare our results to three recent experiment - based structure models , all based on some sort of 20 diameter decagon ( the first two being similar to the burkov cluster of subsec .",
    "[ sec : ideal - burkov ] ) .",
    "we then report on a trial simulation of our own , using the methods of sec .",
    "[ sec : fixed - site ] but with an enriched site list for the lattice gas , from which a 20 decagon packing emerges that is competitive in energy with the 13 model developed in this paper .",
    "after most of our work was completed , a tentative structure solution appeared for the approximant pd4 of the co - rich phase  @xcite with nominal composition al@xmath3co@xmath4ni@xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath26 projection ( see their fig .",
    "3 ) clearly shows an arrangement of decagonal clusters of diameter @xmath41 ( larger than the   by exactly the factor @xmath36 ) .",
    "this 20 cluster appears practically the same as the burkov cluster which  as we explained in subsec .",
    "[ sec : ideal - burkov ]  appears in our structure model .",
    "namely , this decagon has rings 1,2 , and 3 like our   of sec .",
    "[ sec : clusters ] ; their ring 3 al show deviations into ring 2.5 , similar to what occurs in our structures . in half of their clusters , ring 1",
    "is missing a couple of al atoms ; these have more irregularity of their ring 2.5/3 al atoms .",
    "the big difference is that , in pd4 , the 20 decagons do not overlap ; instead , they decorate a fat rhombus with edge 10.4 .",
    "thus , the cluster - cluster linkages in this model are of length @xmath42 , for 20 decagons sharing an edge , or @xmath43 , for 20 decagons related by the short diagonal of a fat rhombus .",
    "it may also be noted that the cluster orientation pattern in pd4 is neither `` ferromagnetic '' nor `` antiferromagnetic '' ; this would suggest that ( in terms of sec .",
    "[ sec : declro ] the 12.2 linkage induces an `` antiferromagnetic '' interaction .",
    "although the `` '' motifs no longer sit at vertices of this 19.7 edge network , that atom cluster is still in evidence .",
    "the difference is that in the pd4 structure , every   is encircled by ten such , whereas this number was smaller in our model of fig .",
    "[ fig : ruleswideal ] . the pd4 atomic structure , like the rigid - site - list models of sec .  [ sec : ideal - deco ] , can be decomposed into a dhbs ( decagon - hexagon - boat - star ) tiling with edge @xmath44 .",
    "in fact , a decagonal model based on pd4 is a concrete example of the structure models intermediate between the `` basic ni '' decoration of ref .   and the decoration of our sec .",
    "[ sec : ideal - deco ] .",
    "such a hybrid model would have 8 decagons , which are absent in the former decoration , but have a larger proportion of 2.45 hbs tiles than in the latter decoration .",
    "( in particular , every edge of the 20 decagon is the centerline of a 2.45 hexagon , decorated typically by a ni - ni pair . )",
    "we expected such an intermediate model to be favored at an intermediate composition such as al@xmath6co@xmath20ni@xmath20 , but the energy differences are quite small , so it may well be competitive at the compositions the present paper focuses on .      another decagonal approximant was discovered with composition al@xmath16ni@xmath45co@xmath46 , close to the `` basic ni '' phase , and a structure model developed based on electron diffraction and z - contrast imaging  @xcite .",
    "this model consists of edge - sharing 20 decagons of the kind we have been describing .",
    "they have al@xmath47tm@xmath48 cores , _ alternating _ in orientation ( the cluster network happens to be bipartite ) .",
    "there are no ring 2.5 al ; about half the edges of the   ( contained in the 20 one ) have two ring 3 al , the other half of the edges have only one ring 3 al . the edges of the 20 decagons , without exception , have two tm atoms .    a good interpretation of the cluster network in ref .",
    "is that the 20 ( edge 6.4 ) decagons occupy the large sites of a binary tiling with edge 16.8 , while pentagonal bipyramids ( ) occupy the small sites .",
    "the vertices of the 20 decagons , as in the pd4 model , are occupied by motifs like the .",
    "such   also occur between pairs of adjacent .",
    "there , they define additional tile vertices which divide the area between the 20 decagons into hexagons , boats , and stars with edge 6.5 .      deloudi et al  @xcite have presented a structure model ( formulated in a 5d - cut framework ) for the same co - rich composition we address here .",
    "they formulate a 20 pentagonal cluster , which is built around the w - phased pentagon cluster ; these can overlap in various ways .",
    "the al / tm assignments in the model are based entirely on those reported in sugiyama s @xmath1(alconi ) refinement  @xcite .",
    "examination of their fig .",
    "1 reveals the relation between their cluster and our   motif .",
    "take each vertex of their 20   decagon that is _ not _ a vertex of the inscribed large pentagon , and draw an arc around it through the adjacent decagon vertices ( which _ are _ vertices of the inscribed pentagon ) ; this arc encloses 3/10 of a .",
    "their model , being based on a stacking period @xmath49 , accomodates not only the pentagonal bipyramid ( ) , but also the puckering of the al atoms we called ring 2.5/ring 3 ( or better , channel atoms ) along the arcs just mentioned .    in fig .",
    "3(a ) of ref .",
    "it can be seen that , although not recognized at all in their formulation , are naturally generated in the interstices between the large pentagons .",
    "the overall pattern could be decribed as a packing of edge - sharing 32 super - decagons ( inflated by one factor of @xmath36 ) , with   placed on the super - decagon centers and odd vertices , and   on the super - decagon even vertices .",
    "( it is not surprising to find descriptions on different length scales : their model , being essentially a decoration of the quasiperiodic penrose tiling , acquires its inflation symmetry . )",
    "we question whether the details of this model are good energetically .",
    "our study suggests that good models are built by combinations of the 8 decagon ( the central part of the ) , of 2.45 edge hbs tiles , plus the . to the extent that this model appears to have incomplete fragments of the 8 decagon , we suspect it will have an increased energy .",
    "it is conceivable that only al atoms are wrong , and the tm atoms are correctly placed , which would still give good agreement with electron micrographs of all kinds .",
    "the  show up prominently in the experimental haadf - stem image of ref .",
    "( their fig .  3(b ) ) as white pentagons , all oriented the same way .",
    "these are not as frequent as they would be in the decoration of our fig .",
    "[ fig : ruleswideal ] , suggesting that our model is not correct for that composition .          fig .",
    "[ fig:20a ] shows an exploratory fixed - site lattice - gas simulation on a 4 tiling in the 32@xmath5023 cell , similar to sec .",
    "[ sec : mc-4a ] , but with a richer set of candidate sites decorating the tiles , and a much longer annealing time .",
    "two 20 decagons are seen in this configuration , in place of the four 13 decagons that typically emerged in our main simulations .",
    "the atomic structure is quite similar to those described above ; a minor difference is that every edge of the   has exactly one ring 3 al , and their placement alternates perfectly .",
    "( that alternation was necessarily disrupted in our model of sec .",
    "[ sec : ideal - deco ] , wherever the s shared edges . )",
    "also , the edges of the 20 decagon are not only ni - ni , but often al - co or ni - co in fig .",
    "[ fig:20a ] .",
    "it would take much more work to settle the optimum decoration of these sites , and the optimum atom content for a decoration based on such configurations .    the 20 based configuration of fig .",
    "[ fig:20a ] is lower in energy by 1.8 mev / atom as compared to the best result of the 13 sort produced by our 4 simulations , if ideal - site configurations are compared .",
    "however , after the rmr protocol in an 8 cell ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : relax ] ) , the 20 type structure was slightly _ higher _ in energy , by 0.6 mev / atom , than the 13 type structure .",
    "( the latter probably contains more al channels , and thus offers more opportunity to reduce energy by puckering . )",
    "overall , it is our impression that  despite the deficiencies ( known and still unknown ) in our potentials , the biggest problem for achieving a correct structure is the search pathway to find it . on the one hand , we think our method has been remarkably successful at predicting characteristic features such as the appearance of the in co - rich compositions .",
    "on the other hand , we have recounted four ways in which our procedure misled us : ( i ) the fixed site list ( ii ) the 8  periodicity ( iii ) the possibility of a larger cluster than ( iv ) the cluster orientation order    a separate note is that our calculations are good only to predict stability between similar decagonal approximant structures .",
    "many deficiencies of our potentials  the dependence on electron density ( and hence on composition , in principle ) ; inaccuracies in the nearest - neighbor tm - tm and tm - al potential wells ; cutoffs at some interaction radius ; omission of three- or four - body terms ; and poor handling of vacancies  will tend to cancel , in such a comparison .",
    "but any phase may , of course , be preempted by a coexistence of two dissimilar phases that happens to have a slightly lower energy ; our pair potentials are more likely to give a wrong answer in this situation . to construct a global phase diagram ,",
    "it is necessary to follow up the kind of search described in this paper , by ab - initio total energy calculations , with an attempt to imagine _ all _ possible competing phases and include them in this database . since it would be prohibitive to try out a large set of candidate structures with the ab - initio codes , the present sort of study is a prerequisite to the phase - diagram studies .",

    "<S> these , and another smaller cluster , decorate vertices of a `` binary tiling '' with rhombus edge 10.4 . further simulations with a restricted site list show that al arrangements on the borders of the 13 decagon cluster form hexagon , boat , and star tiles with edge 2.45 ; they indicate specific sites for co versus ni atoms , and how the structure adapts to small composition changes . in the second half of the paper , relaxation ( augmented by molecular dynamics annealing ) </S>",
