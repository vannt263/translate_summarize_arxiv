    "electrons in low - dimensional systems behave very differently from their three - dimensional counterparts . on the one hand , at low temperatures they tend to distort the lattice ( peierls effect  @xcite ) . for example , poly - acetylene as the simplest @xmath0-conjugated polymer shows an alternation between short and long bonds  @xcite . at the peierls transition",
    "a gap opens in the single - particle spectrum and the metal turns into a peierls insulator . on the other hand",
    ", the electron - electron interaction provides a relevant perturbation in one dimension .",
    "for example , metals in one dimension are luttinger liquids in which the low - energy charge and spin excitations propagate with different velocities so that quasi - particles as in landau fermi - liquid theory are absent in the single - particle spectral function  @xcite . at commensurate band fillings ,",
    "the electron - electron interaction induces umklapp scatterings which turn the metal state into a mott insulator .",
    "this immediately raises the question : which of the two perturbations , peierls distortion or mott transition , dominates the other one ?",
    "this question can be answered within the framework of field theory because both the electron - lattice and the electron - electron interactions destroy the metallic phase even in the limit of weak coupling . as has been shown in  @xcite",
    ", the peierls distortion is always a relevant perturbation in the sense of a renormalization - group analysis whereas the umklapp scatterings which cause the mott transition are only marginally relevant . at large coulomb interactions when the system is a mott insulator ,",
    "the peierls distortion is also present at low temperatures because the effective spin system undergoes a spin - peierls transition .",
    "therefore , one - dimensional lattices are expected to be peierls distorted at zero temperature , irrespective of the presence of the electron - electron interaction .    in presence of a peierls distortion and one electron per lattice site ( half band - filling ) ,",
    "the peierls insulator can be described in terms of a filled lower peierls band and an empty upper peierls band which are separated by a finite peierls gap whose size is proportional to the dimerization strength . in principle",
    ", the finite peierls gap permits a perturbative treatment of the electron - electron interaction",
    ". it should be clear , however , that such a perturbative treatment is limited to ` weak coupling ' , and the range of the validity of perturbation theory remains to be determined .",
    "in particular , even the screened electron - electron interaction in polymers is quite sizable  @xcite , and it remains to be studied in how far wannier theory and similar perturbative approaches  @xcite lead to a reliable description of optical excitations in these materials .    in this work ,",
    "we investigate the extended peierls  hubbard model at half band - filling which models the peierls distortion and the coulomb interaction in ideal poly - acetylene .",
    "the model is introduced in section  [ sec : hamilt ] . in section  [ sec : gsener ] we use standard rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation theory to calculate the ground - state energy to second order in the coulomb interaction and compare our results to numerically exact data from the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) .",
    "we show that second - order perturbation theory is applicable up to interaction strengths as large as the band width . in section  [ sec : singlep ]",
    "we observe the same behavior for the gap for single - particle excitations which increases quickly as a function of the interaction strength .    in order to study optical excitations ,",
    "we follow two routes because rayleigh  schrdinger perturbation theory is inapplicable for a description of bound electron - hole pairs . in section  [ sec : ptapproachestoexc ]",
    "we develop wannier perturbation theory to second order where an exciton is formed already in first order .",
    "alternatively , we introduce the ` two - step perturbation theory ' in which the exciton is formed in a second step after the electrons and holes have been dressed first . in section",
    "[ sec : excitons2nd ] the comparison of our analytical results with those from the dmrg show that second - order wannier theory is superior to the two - step perturbation theory .",
    "the singlet exciton is reasonably well described by wannier theory for moderate interactions but perturbation theory quickly fails for the triplet exciton .",

    "<S> wannier theory is applicable up to coulomb parameters as large as half band width . for triplet excitons , </S>",
    "<S> second - order perturbation theory quickly fails completely . </S>"
