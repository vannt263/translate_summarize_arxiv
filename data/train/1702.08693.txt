    "quarks can be associated in ads / cft with strings stretching between a probe d7 brane and the d3 branes from which the @xmath3 sym gauge fields originate @xcite . in the probe approximation",
    "the d7 branes lie in the @xmath12 field theory directions , @xmath13 and @xmath14 coordinates of the transverse space in the ads@xmath4 metric @xmath15 a flat d7 brane that intersects the d3 at the origin would lie at @xmath16 and describe massless quarks .",

    "there are some sleights of hand here to generate a consistent phenomenological model :    * one should , formally , expand the factors of @xmath23 ( which contain @xmath18 ) but they are retained for two reasons .",
    "if we simply write @xmath24 then if this term trips us through the bf bound in some range of small @xmath13 then the instability would exist however large @xmath25 were to grow .",
    "if we instead promote @xmath13 in this term to @xmath23 then at sufficiently large @xmath26 the instability is no longer present and a full solution for @xmath26 is possible . in addition",
    "when one looks at fluctuations about the background embedding those states only know about the non - trivial embedding through the factors of @xmath26 in the metric - these terms communicate the existence of a gap to the bound states .",
    "we are of course being inconsistent about higher order terms in @xmath18 but the key point is to keep the @xmath27 term that triggers the bf bound violation and the brutality of our other assumptions will be judged by the success of the model below .",
