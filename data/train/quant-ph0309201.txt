    "al.__@xcite and elaborated and developed by several groups  @xcite . while the standard paradigm of quantum computation uses quantum gates ( i.e. , unitary operators ) applied to quantum registers , the main idea of the adiabatic computing algorithms is to encode the initial state and solution state of the problem at hand in properly chosen hamiltonians . generally , the meaning of the `` proper '' is the requirement that the initial and the solution states are the ground states of an initial and final hamiltonians",
    ". then these two hamiltonians are combined in a time - dependent way and system is let to evolve under the influence of this combined hamiltonian .",
    "the speed of mixing is determined by the adiabatic theorem of quantum mechanics  @xcite . according to this theorem ,",
    "if the evolution of a quantum system is governed by a hamiltonian that varies slowly enough , the system will stay near its instantaneous ground state .",
    "the general time - complexity of adiabatic quantum computation is still an open problem  @xcite .",
    "the complexity of the algorithm is determined by the time needed for switching from initial to solution state `` slowly enough '' .",
    "the switching speed depends inversely on the size of the spectral gap between the instantaneous ground and first excited states of the hamiltonian .",
