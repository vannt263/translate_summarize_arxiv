    "over the past 82 years , the study of dipole moments of elementary particles has provided a wealth of information on subatomic physics . from the pioneering work of stern@xcite through the discovery of the large anomalous magnetic moments of the proton@xcite and neutron@xcite",
    ", the ground work was laid for the discovery of spin , of radiative corrections and the renormalizable theory of qed , of the quark structure of baryons and the development of qcd .",
    "a charged particle with spin @xmath1 has a magnetic moment @xmath2 where @xmath3 is called the gyromagnetic ratio .",
    "the expression in the middle is the quantity one finds listed in the particle data tables.@xcite the quantity @xmath4 is the anomalous magnetic dipole moment ( or simply the anomaly ) which is related to the @xmath5-factor in the right - hand equation .",
    "the dirac equation tells us that @xmath6 for spin angular momentum , and is unity for orbital angular momentum ( the latter having been verified experimentally@xcite ) .",
    "this can be seen from the non - relativistic reduction for an electron in a weak magnetic field : @xmath7 \\psi , \\ ] ] and the subscript on @xmath5 is dropped in the following discussion . for point particles ,",
    "the anomaly arises from radiative corrections , three examples of which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : radcor ] .",
    "the `` vertex '' correction and vacuum polarization are important in the lepton anomaly , while the self - energy term is included in the dressed mass .",
    "the situation for baryons is quite different , since their internal quark structure gives them large anomalies .",
    "the vertex correction in lowest - order gives the famous schwinger@xcite result , @xmath8 , which was verified experimentally by foley and kusch.@xcite to lowest order , the s - matrix element@xcite for a charged particle in a magnetic field is given by    @xmath9   u(p ) a^{\\lambda}(q)\\ ] ]    in general @xmath4 ( or @xmath5 ) is an expansion in @xmath10 , @xmath11 with 1 diagram for the schwinger ( second - order ) contribution , 5 for the fourth order , 40 for the sixth order , 891 for the eighth order .",
    "the qed contributions to electron and muon 2 have now been calculated through eighth order , @xmath12 and the the tenth - order contribution has been estimated.@xcite the first few orders are shown schematically below in fig . [",
    "fg : aexpan ] .    .",
    "]    while magnetic dipole moments ( mdms ) are a natural property of charged particles with spin , electric dipole moments ( edms ) are forbidden both by parity and by time reversal symmetry .",
    "interestingly enough , purcell and ramsey@xcite suggested in 1950 that a measurement of the neutron edm would be a good way to search for parity violation , well in advance of the paper by lee and yang . after the discovery of parity violation , landau@xcite and ramsey@xcite pointed out that an edm would violate both _",
    "t _ symmetries .",
    "this can be seen by examining the hamiltonian for a spin one - half particle in the presence of both an electric and magnetic field , @xmath13 .",
    "the transformation properties of @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are given in the table [ tb : tranprop ] , and we see that while @xmath18 is even under all three , @xmath19 is odd under both _",
    "_ t_. thus the existence of an edm implies that both _ p _ and _ t _ are violated . in the context of _ cpt _ symmetry ,",
    "an edm implies _ cp _ violation .",
    "the standard model value for the electron and muon edm is @xmath20 @xmath21-cm , well beyond the reach of experiments ( which are at the @xmath22 @xmath21-cm level ) .",
    "observation of a non - zero @xmath21 or @xmath23 edm would be a clear signal for new physics .",
    ".transformation properties of the magnetic and electric fields and dipole moments . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     a new experiment to search for a permanent edm of the muon with a design sensitivity of @xmath24 @xmath21-cm is now being planned for j - parc.@xcite this sensitivity lies well within values predicted by susy models.@xcite feng , et al.,@xcite have calculated the range of @xmath25 available to such an experiment , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : phicp ] .",
    "available to a dedicated muon edm experiment.@xcite the two bands show the one and two standard - deviation ranges if @xmath26 differs from the standard model value by @xmath27 . ]    with an edm present , the spin precession relative to the momentum is given by @xmath28   + { e \\over m}\\left [ { \\eta \\over 2 } \\left ( { \\vec e \\over c } + \\vec \\beta \\times \\vec b \\right ) \\right ]   \\label{eq : omegawedm}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 and @xmath30 . for reasonable values of @xmath31 , the motional electric field",
    "@xmath32 is much larger than electric fields that can be obtained in the laboratory , and the two vector frequencies are orthogonal to each other .",
    "the edm has two effects on the precession : the magnitude of the observed frequency is increased , and the precession plane is tipped relative to the magnetic field .",
    "e821 was operated at the magic @xmath33 so that the focusing electric field did not cause a spin precession .",
    "the edm signal in e821 is very difficult to observe , since the tipping of the precession plane is very small ( @xmath34 mrad ) .",
    "the dedicated experiment will be operated at 500 mev / c , off of the magic @xmath33 , and will use a radial electric field to stop the @xmath0 precession . thus the edm would cause a steady build - up of the spin out of the plane with time .",
    "detectors would be placed above and below the storage region , and a time - dependent up - down asymmetry would be the signal of an edm .",
    "measurements of the muon and electron anomalies played an important role in our understanding of sub - atomic physics in the 20th century .",
    "the electron anomaly was tied closely to the development of qed .",
    "the subsequent measurement of the muon anomaly showed that the muon was indeed a `` heavy electron '' which obeyed qed.@xcite with the sub - ppm accuracy now available for the muon anomaly,@xcite there may be indications that new physics is beginning to appear .",
    "marciano@xcite has pointed out that using a few very well measured standard model parameters , rather than a global fit to all electroweak measurements , predicts a higgs mass which is much smaller than the present experimental limit from lep .",
    "if one argues that any discrepancy between the standard model value of @xmath26 and the experimental one is an indication that the hadronic contribution has been underestimated , and uses this discrepancy to `` determine the hadronic contribution '' , the higgs mass limit gets even smaller .",
    "marciano concludes that `` hints of ` new physics ' may be starting to appear in quantum loop effects . ''",
    "the non - observation of an electron edm is becoming an issue for supersymmetry , just as the non - observation of a neutron edm implies such a mysteriously ( some would say un - naturally ) small @xmath35-parameter for qcd .",
    "the search for edms will continue , and if one is observed , the motivation for further searches in other systems will be even stronger .",
    "the muon presents a unique opportunity to observe an edm in a second - generation particle , where the _ cp _ phase might be different from the first generation , or the scaling with mass might be quadratic rather than linear .",
    "it is clear that the study of lepton moments ( and neutron edm searches ) will continue to be a topic of great importance in the first part of the 21st century .",
    "both the theoretical and experimental situations are evolving .",
    "stay tuned for further developments .",
