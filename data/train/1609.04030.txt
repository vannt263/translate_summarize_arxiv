    "the recent earthquakes , e.g. , 2010 haiti and chile , 2011 tohoku in japan , again painfully reminded us of the destructive impact of shallow seismicities and the importance of the available and reliable earthquake risk information . at present the risk information of seismicity is mainly from instrumental and historical catalogs ( e.g. , giardini et al .",
    "1999kagan and jackson , 2011 ) , geodesy or plate tectonics ( e.g. , bird et al .",

    "mf7_yuce_black.eps    mf7 is used here for two reasons : ( 1 ) only satellite data is used in mf7 , so that the relative results can be extrapolated to those regions without the marine , aeromagnetic and ground magnetic surveys but only with satellite data , although there are other crustal magnetic field models , for example , ngdc-720 ( http://geomag.org/models/ngdc720.html ) .",

    "we studied a simple coupled field in which the effects of magnetic field and elastic deformation field are taken into account .",
    "equation ( [ eq13 ] ) and ( [ eq14 ] ) show that the line concentrated force will induced a perturbed magnetic field .",
    "this may be resulted from the rearrangement of the magnetic sources because of the elastic deformation induced by the concentrated force .",
    "it can also be seen that the induced magnetic field will indicate the line concentrated force in reverse , and this can be used to constrain the distribution of the line concentrated force , for example , an earthquake in the crust .",
    "seismicities in the continental crust are more dangerous , but they distribute diffusely .",
    "it is an interesting problem to study the relationship between the earthquake and other geo - science data .",
    "some studies has been carried out on the relationship between the satellite magnetic field and earthquakes ( e.g. , li et al . 1992 , ding et al . , 2011 ) , or on assessing intraplate earthquake hazards by satellite magnetic data",
    "( e.g. , von frese1 et al . , 2008 ; taylor et al . ,",
    "the relative results show that satellite magnetic anomaly has a close relationship with the distribution of the earthquakes ; and it is possible to constrain the epicenter distribution by the satellite magnetic field as well .",
    "however , the relationship obtained by these studies is too complicated to be employed in a convenient way .",
    "for example , that of li et al . (",
    "1992 ) showed that earthquakes distributed along the geo - magnetic anomalies or their gradient zone , or their corners , or their junction points , which have some problems in convenience and availability . in this paper , a simpler flag , i.e.",
    ", the zero contours of the @xmath94 is used to constraint to the shallow seismicities in the continental crust .",
    "results from figure [ fig5 ] show that there is a close relationship between the epicenters and the zero - contours of the @xmath94 observed by the satellite .",
    "it can be deduced that the regions where are at these zero - contours , especially those in active tectonic zones , could be the possible seismogenic zones in the future .",
    "consequently , these zero - contours of the @xmath94 could be used as a constraint to the risk information for the continental shallow seismicities , although this constraint could not provide any information on when the earthquake occur , which should be aided with other geo - science data and techniques , because our model is only an elastic one and it is unknown when and how the concentrated forces come into being .",
    "simultaneously , it can be seen from figure [ fig5 ] that some epicenters are not at the zero - contours of the @xmath94 , which are results from many reasons .",
    "firstly if the conditions in section [ sec3 ] are not satisfied , a non - zero @xmath94 could be induced , as shown in figure [ fig2 ] and figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "however , it can be seen that these non - zero @xmath94 are near zero , except that @xmath96 is very large , or @xmath97 is very small .",
    "we take the case in figure [ fig2 ] as an example . if the parameters , such as @xmath16 , in section [ sec3 ] are used ; assuming @xmath97 is 10 km and @xmath96 is @xmath98 , which is corresponding to that an earthquake of ms=5.0 occurs on an area of @xmath99 , although there is no agreement on how much @xmath96 is at present .",
    "such that @xmath100 . therefore , if the conditions in section [ sec3 ] for @xmath94 does not hold , the corresponding deviation is small , except that @xmath96 is very large and/or @xmath97 is very small",
    "secondly these small non - zero @xmath94 may contribute to the uncertainty of earthquake location .",
    "thirdly , the non - zero @xmath94 may come from the satellite geo - magnetic field used here , because it is an only a model , and there may be no enough or even no data in some areas .    in fact , the magnetic induction above the half - space consists of two parts : one is that induced by the concentrated force , the other is the applied magnetic field .",
    "therefore , it is very important to separate completely and accurately the magnetic field induced by the concentrated forces from the earth s magnetic field observed .",
    "it seems that there is no better method to achieve this at present .    here",
    "mf7 is resolved from spherical harmonic degree 16 to 133 , for a clean separation of the lithospheric signal from ionospheric and magnetospheric noise sources could be achieved ( maus et al . , 2008 ) .",
    "however , this maybe eliminates the long - wave length part of the induced field . and the abnormal field from the local crustal rocks , or remanent magnetism from the crustal rocks , may also still be included as well .",
    "they may have influences on or complicate the zero - contours of @xmath94 of the mf7 .    despite the above",
    ", it can be seen from figure [ fig5 ] that the zero - contours of the @xmath94 from satellite could be as a geophysical constraint to the shallow seismicities in the continental crust , which are independent on risk information from geodesy and tectonics . they can also be used as an early and rough monitor for the shallow seismicities before the considerable work from instrument , geodesy and tectonics . with the accumulation of data and advances in processing data , this constraint to the risk information for earthquake",
    "will be more available and reliable .",
    "the seismic events used in this paper occurred between 2011 - 2014 ; while the mf7 used the satellite data observed between 2008 and 2010 .",
    "it can be seen that our results have some ability of `` prewarning '' , although our model is an elastic one , and it is unknown when and how the concentrated forces come into being .",
    "after the analysis and discussions above , the following conclusions can be drawn ,    it is helpful to study the multi - physic fields and their coupled effects for understanding the properties of the complicated system of the earth s . in this paper",
    "the interaction between the magnetic field and elastic deformation field in the crust is studied in a simplified way .",
    "the results show that the line concentrated force will induced a perturbed magnetic field ; the induced magnetic field will indicate the line concentrated force in reverse .    for a line concentrated force in a half space which is magnetized uniformly vertically ( or horizontally )",
