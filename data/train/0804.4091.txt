    "this paper continues the investigation of response properties of quantum systems started in ref .",
    "@xcite . in @xcite",
    "we introduced a _ response formulation _ of the harmonic oscillator and extended it to noninteracting bosonic fields . here",
    "we show that response formulation may be further extended to arbitrary interacting bosonic fields .",
    "response reformulation of fermions will be subject of a separate paper .    for noninteracting bosons @xcite ,",
    "response formulation means description of the quantum system in terms of quantum averages of the _ normally - ordered products _",
    "@xcite of field operators defined in the presence of external sources . in @xcite , we proved that this description is equivalent to the standard quantum - field - theoretical description of the same system within schwinger s renown closed - time - loop formalism @xcite .",
    "the response formulation and the schwinger formalism are coupled by a one - to - one _ response substitution _ in the corresponding characteristic functionals .",
    "it would seem that the obvious way of generalising this result to interacting fields is replacing the normal ordering of free - field operators by the _ time - normal _ ordering of heisenberg operators as introduced by glauber and kelly and kleiner @xcite .",
    "however , we quickly discover that this leads to loss of the key property of the response formulation : its equivalence to the standard green - function approach . without an amendment to the concept of time - normal ordering , response substitution for interacting bosons",
    "does not exist .",
    "this makes the whole exercise pointless : recall that our ultimate goal is extending the phase - space techniques to relativistic problems .",
    "we are therefore forced to choose a different approach .",
    "we take the response substitution found in @xcite for noninteracting bosons , postulate it for interacting bosons , and consider the consequences .",
    "this implies introducing a new definition replacing the familiar time - normal operator ordering .",
    "however , we also show that within the optical paradigm ( technically , within the approximation of slowly varying amplitudes ) this definition coincides with the definition by glauber and kelly and kleiner .",
    "interpretation of any of the quantum - optical experiments needs not be reconsidered .    except being a preparatory work for the phase - space approach to relativistic quantum fields ,",
    "some results of this paper appear to have significance of their own .",
    "first and foremost , we demonstrate that all quantum properties of interacting systems may be interpreted in terms of response and self - radiation . as was explained in paper @xcite , one interpretation of our results is proving the equivalence between schwinger s closed - time - loop formalism @xcite on the one hand , and a certain generalisation of kubo s and glauber s approaches combined on the other . for more details",
    "we refer the reader to the introduction of ref .",
    "all points made there apply not just to the harmonic oscillator , but also to any interacting bosonic quantum system .",
    "perhaps the most interesting result of this paper is a fundamental link between response and noncomutivity of operators .",
    "indication of this connection may be seen already in kubo s famous formula for the linear response function @xcite , where the latter is expressed by the average of the two - time commutator .",
    "this feature is shown to hold for the full nonlinear quantum - statistical response of interacting systems .",
    "the assumption that operators commute cancels the dependence of the system properties on external sources turning the system into a `` pre - assigned quantum source . ''",
    "another interesting result , which plays only a technical role in our analyses but seems to be important on its own , is that all response properties of a system are contained in the field operator defined without the external source . in other words ,",
    "the information contained in the field operator ( and in the intial condition ) suffices to describe any _ scattering experiment _ performed on the system , a fact which has never been fully appreciated and which has profound consequences for the quantum measurement theory .",
    "again , a known example of this is kubo s formula where the linear response to a source is specified in terms of the field operators defined without the source .",
    "one technical point merits special mentioning here .",
    "all usual problems of the quantum field theory like adiabatically switching the interaction on and off , renormalisations and the like are securely locked away in the assumption that heisenberg field operators and green s functions `` may be defined . '' in particular , we do not make any effort at specifying green s functions at coinciding time arguments because in all practical calculations such specifications emerge as a side - effect of a _",
    "regularisation procedure_. this is the case in the relativistic quantum field theory @xcite as well as for simple nonrelativistic models @xcite .",
    "note that , in the latter case , regularisations may be applied directly to the phase - space equations in the form of specifying a stochastic calculus @xcite .",
    "a similar regularisation procedure will be introduced in our forthcoming papers for relativistic phase - space models .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section [ ch : summ ]",
    ", we introduce the necessary quantum - field - theoretical concepts , such as time orderings of operators , green s functions and their characteristic functionals . in section [ ch : harmrevi ] , we reiterate the key results of paper @xcite . using these results as leading considerations ,",
    "we then proceed to defining the response formulation of interacting bosons . in section [ ch : npert ]",
    "we prove that the two ways of describing the system , in terms of the field operator defined with and without the external source , are formally equivalent . in section [ ch :",
    "physpr ] , we define the concepts inherent in the response formulation , such as time - normal operator ordering , quantum - statistical response functions and related characteristic functionals .",
    "in particular , we show why the glauber - kelly - kleiner definition of the time - normal ordering must be amended , and why our amendmend is inessential for quantum optics . in section [ ch :",
    "noscresp ] , we derive formulae relating green s functions to response functions and _ vice versa_. among other things , we show that our expression for the linear response function coincides with kubo s formula , and give explicit demonstration of the link between operator noncommutativity and response . in section [ ch :",

    "[ app : fpn ] , we summarise the necessary facts regarding separating the frequency - positive and negative parts of a function .",
