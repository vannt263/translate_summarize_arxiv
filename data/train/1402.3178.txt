    "we used the conventional stm set - up in a dilution refrigerator with the possibility to apply a magnetic field upto 8 t. previous experiments in the same set - up have demonstrated subatomic spatial scanning capabilities , an energy resolution of 15 @xmath30ev in spectroscopy@xcite , and a lowest temperature of 100 mk . to measure the tin thin films",
    ", we mounted one thin film whose resistance vs temperature , current and magnetic field had been measured previously in refs.@xcite .",
    "we placed a mechanically sharpened tip of au on top of the sample and cooled down .",
    "close to the sample , we placed an au pad to clean the tip .",
    "after cleaning the tip immediately on cool down , we moved in - situ the tip to the sample and obtained excellent tunneling conditions with large scale images reproducible as a function of the tunneling conductance and high valued work functions ( several ev )",
    ". images show a flat surface with a small corrugation , below the nm .",
    "bulk tin has a fermi surface made out of three bands from bonding - antibonding mixtures of @xmath31 character crossing the fermi level @xcite .",
    "one leads to a cross centered aroung @xmath32 touching the brillouin zone at the x points , an the other two are small electron pockets at @xmath32 .",
    "effective masses range from 1.1m@xmath33 to 1.8m@xmath33 ( with m@xmath33 the free electron mass ) , and the fermi level is at a rising portion of the overall density of states , having close to it ( at around 1 ev ) a pronounced maximum . with disorder , the properties of the crystal are washed out , leading gradually to isotropic fermi surfaces and a featureless density of states . because the density of states is so close to a maximum , we can expect an increase in the effective mass of the electrons with increased scattering .    in our samples",
    ", being disordered and closer to the insulating phase , with a strong granular structure and a short mean free path , the concept of a fermi surface at a macroscopic level is not well defined . from the resistivity , and the value of the superconducting coherence length ( @xmath34 nm from b@xmath35 ) , we can expect k@xmath361.5 ( using an effective mass of m@xmath37 ) in the superconducting sample .",
    "however , within a single crystallite , electrons should behave qualitatively with properties similar to that in bulk single crystals , with a reduced mean free path .",
    "thus , the size of the charge density modulations observed in the samples provides fixed points for electron ordering at the fermi surface .",
    "the bragg peak positions give the corresponding charge modulation wavevectors .",
    "the tin thin films were grown using atomic layer deposition using reactant gases ticl@xmath38 and nh@xmath39@xcite .",
    "the growth of crystals is columnar - like with extremely small boundary regions between crystallites , ranging only of a few atomic layers@xcite .",
    "this aspect is confirmed in our atomic scale images ( fig s1 ) .",
    "impurities in the crystallites can be carbon atoms and chlorine , introduced during deposition .",
    "these are marginally present and are difficult to detect using surface analysis procedures .",
    "the nominal composition of our sample is tin@xmath40 with 3.5% of cl .",
    "one possibility is that carbon and chlorine defects are distributed over crystallite boundaries , producing electron scattering .",
    "the tin films are very thin ( 5 nm is just some ten unit cells ) and it can seem surprising that they remain intact for a long time after fabrication .",
    "this implies an extreme stability to chemical activity at ambient conditions , and has been studied previously , regarding the applications of this material e.g. in junction fabrication for microelectronic devices , cosmetics or optical filering @xcite .",
    "tin adds up indeed the advantages of metallic ti - ti bonding for optics and the high melting point and hardness for applications requiring mechanical and thermal stability .",
    "tin films have many applications , such as improving oxydation resistance in cutting tools@xcite .",

    "1 and 3 correspond to the two crystallites , which are seen with different atomic orientations .",
    "the boundary between these two regions is marked by numeral 2 , where formation of charge density modulations can be seen . in the panel ( b ) and ( d ) , the 2d - fft image of panel ( a and ( c ) ) , three configurations of the bright spots are seen .",
    "the encircled green spots represent the atomic orienations in the crystallite , marked by 3 , in panel ( a ) and ( c ) .",
    "the encircled red spots are fft of the crystallite , marked by 1 .",
    "a change of atomic orienations from 3 to 1 is about 30 degrees .",
    "the light blue spots with longer wavelengths represent the periodicity of the charge density modulations , which are seen confined at the crystalline boundary .",
    "this highlights the role of crystalline boundaries in disorder electron scattering and possibly the formation of standing wave patterns on the film surface .",
    "such electron scattering at the crystalline bounaries may also result in the enhanced electron - elctron repulsion effect @xcite , in the 2-d disordered films@xcite .    in figure s2 ( a ) and ( b ) , we show the filtered images of the charge modulations over atomic lattice .",

    "<S> the absence of quasi - particle peaks assert that there is a tendency to phase break at these positions weaking the superconducting state .    in figure 3 </S>",
    "<S> , we provide the conductance maps at selected bias voltages from 0.0 mv to 0.75 mv at an interval of 0.05 mv . in each panel , </S>",
    "<S> the bias voltage is shown in the top left corner , and the color scale represents the change of the conductance pertaining to the maximal values at that bias voltage . </S>",
    "<S> such a represenation is chosen in order to highlight visually the change in the spatial conductance maps with the increase in the bias voltage . at v = 0.0 mv , </S>",
    "<S> a small contrast is seen in the region which have the conductance curves without the quasi - particle peaks . </S>",
    "<S> we believe this should mimic the fluctuations in the density of states when the film is normal . </S>",
    "<S> the contrast between the two regions ( with and without quasi - particle peaks ) increases with the bias voltage , and at 0.25 mv , the maximum contrast can be seen in the conductance map . with further increase in the bias voltage , </S>",
    "<S> the contrast decreases , and nearly disappears at 0.4 mv , except at the interface between the regions separating two types of conductance behaviors , where the white lines appear which corresponds to the lower conductance values for these curves . </S>",
    "<S> the near uniform contrast at 0.4 mv corresponds to the crossover of the majority of the tunneling conductance curves exhibiting two behaviors . from 0.45 mv </S>",
    "<S> the bright regions highlight the reversal of the relative conductance changes between the two regions , and it continues to peak at the bias voltage of 0.55 mv , close to the position of the quasi - particle peaks in the bcs - like curves . </S>",
    "<S> further increase in the bias voltage decreases the contrast , and near uniform conductance maps are seen from 0.7 mv onwards upto 1 mv . </S>",
    "<S> the uniform conductance ( without any trace of two different regions ) at 0.75 mv suggests that the spatial conductance changes occur only in the range of bias voltage , corresponding to the opening of the gap , asserting the locally varying electronic behavior in the film with the formation of the superconducting phase . </S>",
    "<S> our measurements suggest that the effect of the disordered electron scattering on the superconducting phase is to produce concurrent conductance fluctuations at energies close to the superconducting energy gap at the beat positions of the charge density modulations . </S>",
    "<S> the zero field data imply that the superconducting conductance curves deviates from the s - wave bcs - like behavior , with reduced quasi - particle peaks . </S>",
    "<S> these are typical sts observations close to the superconductor to insulator transition in the disordered films . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we believe the spatial changes in the local properties in the superconductins phase reflect a displacement of electronic states , and the total amount of states remains roughly the same in the normal state , at the energy range studied here . </S>",
    "<S> these observations may be extended to the other disordered superconducting films .    </S>",

    "<S> ( a ) , the curves with quasi - particle peaks shown in blue color are at zero magnetic field , and with the increase in the field to 1.5 t , the peaks are suppressed , and disappear at 4 t. in the regions where quasiparticle peaks are absent , the conductance curves merely widen at higher fields upto 4 t. the conductance curve at 4 t also near uniformly shows a considerable reduced states near zero bias voltage in this film . in order to compare the changes at zero magnetic field , with respect to the conductance at 4 t , the normalized curves are shown in the panels , ( c ) and ( d ) , respectively for the representative curves in both the regions . with this procedure , </S>",
    "<S> the conductance curve at 4 t is brought to near unity at all the bias voltage values , and the relative differences are seen . at 1.5 t in panel ( c ) and ( d ) , the increase in the conductance is about equal mangitude for both the regions . </S>",
    "<S> this observation points out that at 0 t , on the background of the nearly equal average conductance ( i.e. , at 4 t ) , the quasi - particle peaks develop with different heights , while forming the superconducting phase in this film . </S>",
    "<S> it also relates to the spatial map of the average conductance in fig . </S>",

    "<S> another significant observation that the variation of the conductance is logarithmic relates to the long range coulomb electron - electron repulsion being enhanced in the quasi-2d films of tin due to the presence of disorder@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our measurement asserts that the cooper pairing emerges out of an electronic structure with a strongly reduced density of states at the fermi level . </S>",

    "<S> the reduced tunneling conductance features far from bcs s - wave theory can also be related to strongly reduced electronic states close to the fermi level </S>",
    "<S> . we do not observe such visible spatial changes at high magnetic fields to be able to relate to the inhomogenieties in the superconducting phase . </S>",

    "<S> charge density modulations observed at the crystalline boundaries ( figure s2 ) suggest that the microscopic drive towards the disorder induced insulating like phase might set in locally by the inelastic scattering in some areas of the film . at the same time the diffusive motion of electrons </S>",
    "<S> sets up the long range correlation of the charge density modulations . </S>",
    "<S> zero bias anomaly in the tin film in the normal state relates to the disorder enhanced repulsive coulomb interaction which leads to deviation of the bcs gap in the clean superconducting tin film . </S>",
    "<S> clearly determination of the superconducting gap is difficult in these films as the tunneling spectra contain information on both the pairing and repulsive interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial inhomogeneities in the superconducting gap are therefore difficult to establish in the 2d disordered thin films . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial positions where the quasi - particle peaks are suppressed but possibly the superconducting gap still surviving may be interpreted as a result of the phase fluctuations . this indicates a possibility of localization of cooper pairs in these regions , amid a general bosonic character of the remaining of the film . with further increase in the disorder we expect the zero bias anomaly to pronounce and the superconducting gap will further reduce@xcite . close to the sit , </S>",

    "<S> the formation of the localized superconducting regions co - existing with the strongly disordered 2d - metallic phase across sit may be a very remote possibility . </S>",
    "<S> the complete suppression of the superconducting state at sit follows the loss of long range phase coherence in the entire film at a critical disorder and ascertains a fermionic mechanism . till now </S>",
    "<S> there is no experimental evidence for the superconducting gap to be present in the insulating side or whether the spatial inhomogeneity on the superconducting side will lead to a bose insulating phase across sit . </S>",
    "<S> however , in our results we find evidences of the regions of localized cooper pairs surrounded by the phase correlated superconducting areas . </S>",
    "<S> the interface of the two regions exhibit intermediate curves ( at bias voltage 0.4 mv in figure 3 ) with relatively energy independent density of states . </S>",
    "<S> our results assert the possibility of superconducting and bose insulating regions co - exististing if the local disorder and the charge density modulations segregates two behaviors in the 2d films . in conclusion </S>",
