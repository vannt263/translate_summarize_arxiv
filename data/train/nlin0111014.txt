    "the precise quantum signatures of different qualitative types of classical motion and the very definition of chaos in quantum mechanics are still the issues of an unsettled discussion ( see e.g. @xcite ) . due to unitarity of quantum dynamics",
    ", quantum chaos can not be defined in the same way as the classical chaos @xcite , namely through the exponential sensitivity on the variation of initial conditions .",
    "however , peres @xcite proposed an alternative concept which can be used in classical as well as in quantum mechanics : one can study the stability of quantum motion with respect to a small variation in the hamiltonian , or more generally , a variation of the unitary evolution operator . clearly , in classical mechanics this concept , when applied to individual trajectories ( or to phase space distribution functions as we show below in sect .  4 ) , is equivalent to the sensitivity to initial conditions : integrable systems with regular orbits are stable against small variation in the hamiltonian ( the statement of kam theorem ) , where s for chaotic orbits varying the hamiltonian has a similar effect as varying the initial condition : exponential divergence of two orbits for two nearby chaotic hamiltonians .",
    "this paper is devoted to a systematic theoretical study of the stability of a unitary time evolution with respect to small static variations of the unitary propagator .",
    "it will be primarily applied to the schr \" odinger propagator in quantum dynamics ( sect .  2 and 3 ) ,",
    "however an alternative application to the stability of classical unitary perron - frobenius evolution will be considered for comparison ( sect .  4 ) .",
    "the quantity of the central interest here is the _ fidelity _ of unitary ( quantum ) motion .",
    "let us consider a unitary operator @xmath6 being either ( i ) a short - time propagator @xmath7 , or ( ii ) a floquet map @xmath8 of ( periodically time - dependent ) hamiltonian @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) , or ( iii ) a quantum poincar ' e map or any other quantized symplectic map . in any case a general small perturbation of the unitary operator can be written in the following form @xmath11 where @xmath12 is some self - adjoint operator , @xmath2 is a perturbation strength and @xmath3 is an effective planck constant which is taken out explicitly so that the observable @xmath12 has a well defined classical limit ( e.g. the corresponding weyl symbol ) .",
    "the influence of a small perturbation to the unitary evolution is quantitatively described by the overlap @xmath13 measuring the hilbert space distance between the exact and the perturbed time evolution from the same initial pure state @xmath14 , @xmath15 , where _ integer _",
    "@xmath16 is a discrete time ( in units of the period @xmath17 ) .",
    "this defines the _ fidelity _ @xmath18 where @xmath19 gives the expectation value in the initial state @xmath20 .",
    "more generally , it may be useful to statistically average the fidelity over an ensemble of _ different pure initial states _ @xmath21 appearing with _ probabilities _ @xmath22 .",
    "thus we will write the fidelity in terms of a _ statistical density operator _",
    "@xmath23 , namely as eq .",
    "( [ eq : ft ] ) using the conventional statistical expectation value @xmath24 .",
    "the theoretical discussion in this paper is fully general , however , we will later apply our theory in the two extreme situations , namely for the ( coherent ) pure initial state @xmath25 , and for the full hilbert space average @xmath26 which is also equivalent to considering a _ random _ pure initial state of maximal information entropy .",
    "integer @xmath27 denotes a dimension of the relevant hilbert space which can be written semiclassically by the thomas - fermi rule @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the classical phase - space ( or energy shell ) volume and @xmath30 is the number of ( relevant ) degrees of freedom .    the quantity @xmath31 , or its equivalent definitions , have already been discussed in several different contexts in quantum physics .",
    "we name just a few , namely those which provided direct motivation for the present work : first , @xmath31 has been proposed by peres @xcite as a measure of the stability of quantum motion .",
    "second , @xmath32 is the _ loschmidt echo _ characterizing the _ dynamical irreversibility _ , which has been used e.g. in spin - echo experiments @xcite where one is interested in the overlap between the initial state @xmath20 and an _ echo _ state @xmath33 obtained by composing forward time evolution , imperfect time inversion with a residual ( non - invertible ) interaction described by the operator @xmath34 , and backward time evolution .",
    "third , the fidelity has become a standard measure characterizing the loss of phase coherence in the quantum computation @xcite .",
    "fourth , it was used to characterize the `` hypersensitivity to perturbations '' in related studies of information theoretic characterization of quantum chaos @xcite , though in a different context of a stochastically time - dependent perturbation .    the main result of this paper is a relation of the fidelity to the ergodic properties of quantum dynamics , more precisely to the time autocorrelation function of the generator of perturbation @xmath12 .",
    "quantum dynamics of finite and bound systems has always a _ discrete spectrum _ since the effective hilbert space dimension @xmath27 is finite , hence it is _ non - ergodic _ and _ non - mixing _",
    "@xcite : time correlation functions have fluctuating tails of order @xmath35 . in order to reach a genuinely complex quantum motion with a continuous spectrum one",
    "has to enforce @xmath36 by considering one of the following two limits : semi - classical limit of effective planck s constant @xmath4 , or thermodynamic limit of number of particles , or number of freedoms @xmath37 .",
    "our result is surprising in the sense that it predicts the fidelity to decay slower if the integrated time correlation function is smaller , i.e. if the relaxation process is faster",
    ". in particular , for ergodic and sufficiently mixing dynamics ( such that the time integrated autocorrelation function of the perturbation @xmath12 is finite ) the fidelity is found to decay _ exponentially _ on a time - scale @xmath38 , whereas for a ` more regular ' , non - ergodic dynamics with non - vanishing time - averaged correlation functions , the fidelity decay is found to be qualitatively faster with a characteristic time - scale @xmath39 . however , this surprising and apparently counterintuitive result is correctly reconciled with the expected corresponding behavior in the classical limit due to non - trivial non - interchangability of the limits @xmath5 and @xmath4 . in all cases ,",
    "the relevant time - scale for the decay of fidelity in the semi - classical regime can be explicitly computed in terms of the classical quantities only ( e.g. classical correlation functions ) .",
    "the main theoretical predictions are clearly demonstrated on the numerical examples of a kicked top and a pair of coupled kicked tops .",
    "furthermore , our theory on fidelity is general and can be applied to any perturbed unitary evolution ; as an example we consider the stability of the classical unitary perron - frobenius ( liouville ) evolution for maps , where we show how ` classical fidelity ' behaves in a qualitatively different way than the quantum fidelity and conforms to the corresponding linearly stable and exponentially unstable behaviors in the respective limiting cases of regular and chaotic dynamics .",
    "two short announcements of our theory with applications in the contexts of many - body quantum dynamics and quantum computing have already been reported @xcite .    in section 2",
    ", we present a theoretical derivation of the general relation between the fidelity of unitary motion and the correlation decay , discuss qualitatively different regimes of stability in the semiclassical range of small effective @xmath3 and outline the corresponding time - scales . in section 3 , our theoretical predictions are demonstrated in detail by numerical experiments on a quantized kicked top .",
    "in addition , we consider also a pair of coupled kicked tops in order to illustrate some dimensionality dependent aspects . in section 4 , we demonstrate the conceptual difference between the stability of classical and quantum unitary evolution by applying our theory to the case of classical ( liouvillian ) unitary evolution of phase space densities . in section 5 ,",
    "we conclude by pointing to some potentially important applications and implications of our results .",
    "we start by rewriting the fidelity ( [ eq : ft ] ) in terms of the heisenberg evolution of the perturbation @xmath40 .",
    "let us recursively insert the unity @xmath41 in the definition ( [ eq : ft ] ) for @xmath31 and observe @xmath42 for @xmath43 running from @xmath44 downto @xmath45 , yielding @xmath46 the obvious next step is to expand the product ( [ eq : fprod ] ) into a power - series in @xmath2 @xmath47 where the operator @xmath48 denotes a left - to - right time ordering .",
    "such a perturbative expansion converges absolutely for any @xmath2 provided only that the perturbation @xmath12 is a bounded operator .",
    "therefore , the fidelity may be computed by an arbitrary truncation of the above expansion ( [ eq : fsum ] ) where its order @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) depends only on the desired accuracy @xmath51 .",
    "we can see that the fidelity @xmath31 can be expressed entirely in terms of time correlation functions of the generator @xmath12 of perturbation .    before proceeding",
    "further we note that the first order term ( @xmath52 ) can be trivially eliminated , namely by transforming the perturbations as @xmath53 with @xmath54 ( i.e. the perturbation @xmath12 has to be _ traceless _ if @xmath26 ) .",
    "this does not affect the absolute value @xmath55 since a shift by a multiple of unity reflects in a simple complex rotation of fidelity @xmath56 .",
    "so , to the lowest non - trivial order ( @xmath57 ) we find @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a 2-point time correlation function of the quantum observable @xmath12 . in the following",
    ", the regime of sufficiently small @xmath2 , such that the fidelity remains close to @xmath60 ( i.e. @xmath61 ) and the above formula ( [ eq : f2nd ] ) is accurate , will be referred to as the regime of _ linear response_. although we have a general convergent formula for systematic higher order corrections ( [ eq : fsum ] ) we note that all the qualitative and in most cases even quantitative results of this paper can be explained by this simple linear - response kubo - like formula ( [ eq : f2nd ] ) .",
    "an interesting and somewhat counterintuitive conclusion can be drawn from the expression ( [ eq : f2nd ] ) , namely the _ smaller _ the time - integrated correlation function the _ higher _ the fidelity . in the semiclassical regime of approaching the classical limit @xmath4",
    "the quantum correlation function @xmath62 goes over to the corresponding classical correlation function provided a state @xmath63 converges to some classical phase space distribution , like e.g. for @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , the fidelity for classically chaotic systems will decay with the rate which is _ inversely proportional _ to their rate of mixing , and furthermore for classically non - ergodic , i.e. regular or integrable motion , the correlation functions will generally not decay to zero and the fidelity will therefore decay much faster . of course , this surprising general conclusions can only be true if the initial state @xmath20 ( or the statistical density matrix @xmath63 ) is _ sufficiently random _",
    ", i.e. if it is not a small linear combination of the eigenstates of @xmath6 ( or @xmath64 ) as will be discussed in more detail later .",
    "now let us have a closer look at fidelity in the two qualitatively different regimes of correlation decay .",
    "here we assume that the system is ( classically ) ergodic and mixing such that the correlation function of the perturbation @xmath12 decays sufficiently fast ; this typically ( but not neccessarily ! ) corresponds to globally chaotic classical motion .",
    "due to _ ergodicity _ we will safely assume @xmath26 , i.e. average over the full hilbert space @xmath65 . for any other initial state",
    "( e.g. in the worst case for the minimal wavepacket  coherent state ) one obtains identical results on @xmath31 for sufficiently long times , i.e. longer than the _",
    "ehrenfest  ergodic _",
    "time @xmath66 ( for a classically chaotic system with maximal lyapunov exponent @xmath67 ) needed for a minimal wavepacket to spread effectively over the accessible phase space .",
    "the state averaged quantum correlation function is homogeneous in time @xmath68 so we simplify the second order  linear response ",
    "formula for the fidelity @xmath69 and note again that we have assumed @xmath12 to be traceless @xmath70 .",
    "if the decay of correlation function @xmath71 is sufficiently fast , namely it is sufficient that the sums @xmath72 exist for @xmath73 and that a certain characteristic _ mixing time _ exists , e.g. @xmath74 , then the above formula can be further simplified . for times",
    "@xmath75 we can neglect the second term under the summation in ( [ eq : fc ] ) and obtain a linear decay in time @xmath16 in the linear response regime @xmath76 which is a transport coefficient given by the integral of correlation function .",
    "we can make a stronger statement in a non - linear - response regime if we make an additional assumption on the factorization of higher order time - correlations ",
    "@xmath77point mixing .",
    "this implies that @xmath78-point correlation @xmath79 is appreciably different from zero for @xmath80 only if all the ( ordered ) time indices @xmath81 are _ paired _ with the time differences within each pair @xmath82 being of the order or less than @xmath83 .",
    "then we can make a further reduction , namely if @xmath84 @xmath85 so that we obtain a global exponential decay @xmath86 with a time - scale @xmath87 .",
    "we should stress again that the above result ( [ eq : fmix ] ) has been derived by the assumption of true quantum mixing which can be justified only in the limit @xmath88 , e.g. either in semiclassical or thermodynamic limt .",
    "however , precise study of finite size effects and the relevant time and perturbation scales will be given in subsection [ sec : timepert ] .",
    "the opposite situation of a non - mixing and non - ergodic quantum dynamics , which typically corresponds to integrable , quasi - integrable ( kam ) , or mixed classical dynamics , is characterized by a non - vanishing time - average of the correlation function @xmath89 here , due to non - ergodicity , time - average @xmath90 depends on the choice of the initial state @xmath20 or , more generally , on the density matrix @xmath63 .",
    "we assume that a characteristic averaging time - scale @xmath91 exists , namely it is an effective time @xmath92 at which the limiting process ( [ eq : cinfty ] ) converges .",
    "therefore , for sufficiently large times @xmath93 the linear - response formula ( [ eq : f2nd ] ) gives , in contrast to ( [ eq : sigma ] ) , a simple _ quadratic decay _ in time @xmath94 with time - scale @xmath95 .",
    "one should observe that the non - ergodic time - scale @xmath96 can be much smaller than the ergodic - mixing time - scale @xmath97 ( [ eq : fmix ] ) provided @xmath3 is fixed , or the limit @xmath5 is taken prior to the limit @xmath4 .",
    "again , we can make much stronger general statement using an additional assumption .",
    "namely , if we assume that @xmath98 then we can re - write the @xmath99-tuple sums in the series ( [ eq : fsum ] ) in terms of a _ time average perturbation operator _",
    "@xmath100 namely @xmath101 note that @xmath102 is by construction an _ integral of motion _",
    "@xcite , @xmath103\\equiv 0 $ ] , and reduces to a trivial multiple of identity ( in fact , it vanishes with our choice of @xmath70 ) in the ergodic case of previous subsection . whereas in an ergodic and mixing case , @xmath104th order term of ( [ eq : fsum ] ) grows with time only as @xmath105 ( for even @xmath99 ) since it is dominated by pair time correlations , here in a non - ergodic case , the non - trivial time average operator @xmath102 already gives the dominant effect , namely @xmath106 for @xmath104th order term of ( [ eq : fsum ] ) , so the effect of pair time correlations can safely be neglected for sufficiently long times ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "observe also that time averaged correlation is just a second moment of the time average operator @xmath107 in the semiclassical regime , @xmath90 goes to a purely classical , @xmath3-independent quantity @xmath108 _ only _ for such initial states @xmath20 , corresponding to @xmath3-independent distribution of initial conditions in the classical phase space , e.g. for random states or @xmath26 .",
    "formula ( [ eq : favg ] ) expresses the fidelity in terms of a sequence of moments @xmath109 .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that for a general class of one - dimensional spin chains , the moments in _ thermodynamic limit _",
    "@xmath37 of long chains tend to a _",
    "behavior @xmath110 , @xmath111 , so fidelity exhibits a gaussian decay @xmath112 although good numerical agreement with this formula has been observed in several related contexts , e.g. in quantum computing @xcite , it can not be generally valid , in particular not in the semiclassical regime with a small number of freedoms @xmath30 , as we show below .    in general , we can rewrite the formula ( [ eq : favg ] ) in terms of ( average ) _ local density of states _ ( ldos ) of the time average @xmath102 which is defined ( for finite @xmath27 ) as @xmath113 where @xmath114 are the eigenvalues and @xmath115 the eigenstates of self - adjont operator @xmath102 .",
    "namely @xmath116 so the fidelity @xmath117 of non - ergodic systems is just a fourier transformation of ldos @xmath118 of the time average perturbation @xmath102 ( which becomes the simple ( global ) density of states in case of an uniform average @xmath26 ) .",
    "thus only a gaussian ldos would yield a gaussian fidelity decay ( [ eq : fgauss ] ) , however we often find good finite time gaussian behavior which goes beyond the second moment @xmath119 , even if the asymptotic time dependence is completely different , see e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig : analit ] for an example of kicked top .",
    "let us now try to give some semi - classical estimates on the fidelity decay in non - ergodic regime by expressing the asymptotics @xmath4 in terms of classical information only .",
    "here we assume that our ( classical ) map is integrable so that there exist @xmath30 canonical constants of motion  the action variables @xmath120 , which are quantized using ebk rule @xmath121 where integers @xmath122 are _ quantum numbers _ and integers @xmath123 maslov indices . since the time average operator @xmath102 commutes with @xmath6 and with the actions @xmath124 , it is diagonal in ( generically non - degenerate ) basis of eigenstates of @xmath124 ( quantized tori ) @xmath125 , namely in the leading semiclassical order @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the corresponding classical time - averaged observable in action space .",
    "the fidelity ( [ eq : favg ] ) can therefore be written as @xmath128 now , provided the diagonal elements of the density matrix can be written in terms of some smooth function @xmath129 , and replacing the sum ( [ eq : fscs ] ) by an integral over the action space , which is justified for small @xmath3 up to classically long time @xmath130 , we obtain @xmath131 the obvious next step is to compute this integral by a method of stationary phase . however , the result depends on the precise form of the function @xmath132 ( which may also explicitly depend on @xmath3 ) so we only work out the details for two important special cases .",
    "let us first assume uniform averaging over ( random ) initial states @xmath26 , so @xmath133 .",
    "then , for large @xmath134 the above integral ( [ eq : fsemi ] ) can be written as a sum of contributions stemming from , say @xmath17 points , @xmath135 where the phase is stationary , @xmath136 , yielding @xmath137 where @xmath138 is a matrix of second derivatives at the stationary point @xmath139 , and @xmath140 where @xmath141 are the numbers of positive / negative eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath142 .",
    "we repeat that the stationary phase formula ( [ eq : fsqrt ] ) is expected to be correct in the range @xmath143 .",
    "most interesting to note is the asymptotic power - law time and perturbation dependence @xmath144 , which allows for a possible crossover to a gaussian decay ( [ eq : fgauss ] ) when approaching the thermodynamic limit @xmath37 .",
    "now let us consider a single @xmath30-dimensional general coherent state centered at @xmath145 in action - angle space , @xmath146 , @xmath147 where @xmath148 is a positive symmetric @xmath149 matrix of squeezing parameters , giving @xmath150 and @xmath151 using the assumption @xmath152 , we see that a unique stationary point @xmath153 of the exponent approaches @xmath154 as @xmath5 , @xmath155 so we may explicitly evaluate ( [ eq : fcohst ] ) by the method of stationary phase without any lower bound on the range of time @xmath16 , @xmath156 note that the fidelity decay for a coherent initial state with regular classical motion has a time - scale @xmath157 which is consistent with ( [ eq : fr2 ] ) with @xmath158 and is typically ( for small @xmath3 ) larger than the time - scale @xmath159 for a random initial state .",
    "however , surprisingly enough , for sufficiently small @xmath2 , fidelity decay for coherent state with regular classical dynamics can still be faster than the fidelity decay for ergodic and mixing dynamics .",
    "it should be noted that the above derivation for fidelity decay of a coherent state ( [ eq : cs]-[eq : taunecoh ] ) remains valid in a quasi - integrable ( kam ) situation of mixed classical phase space , provided that the initial wave packet is launched in a _ regular region _ of phase space where ( local ) action - angle variables exist .    from the derivation of gaussian behavior ( [ eq : fcoh ] ) we can also begin to understand the reason for a faster _ gaussian _ decay of fidelity for a non - mixing system in contrast to the _ exponential _ decay for a mixing case .",
    "namely , in the non - mixing case , the displacement between centers of the wave packets of two nearby regular evolutions grows _ ballistically _ and thus produces destructive interference ( i.e. decay of fidelity ) much faster than in the case of mixing dynamics where the destructive interference builds up in a _ diffusive _ , random way .",
    "the theoretical relations of the previous subsections are strictly justified in the asymptotics @xmath36 . however , in any experimentally or practically relevant situation the dimensionality of the relevant hilbert ( sub)space @xmath27 is finite , so we have to discuss in detail the limitations and additional time and perturbation scales associated with this .",
    "first of all , for finite @xmath27 , fidelity @xmath31 can not decay indefinitely but starts to fluctuate for long times due to discreteness of the spectrum of the evolution operator @xmath6 .",
    "let us write the eigenphases of @xmath6 and @xmath64 , and the corresponding eigenvectors , respectively , as @xmath160 , @xmath161 , and @xmath162 , @xmath163 , @xmath164 , satisfying @xmath165 , @xmath166 .",
    "let us define a unitary operator @xmath167 which maps the eigenbasis of @xmath6 to the eigenbasis of @xmath64 , namely @xmath168 for all @xmath169 , with matrix elements @xmath170 , and write the matrix elements of the statistical averaging operator as @xmath171 .",
    "note that the matrix @xmath172 is real orthogonal , @xmath173 , if @xmath6 and @xmath64 possess a common anti - unitary symmetry ( e.g. time - reversal ) .",
    "now it is straightforward to rewrite the fidelity ( [ eq : ft ] ) as @xmath174 where @xmath175 is a matrix element of the operator product @xmath176 . at this point",
    "we are interested in the long time fluctuations so we compute the time average fidelity fluctuation @xmath177 in the process of averaging over the time we have assumed that the eigenphases are non - degenerate so @xmath178 .",
    "so we see that fidelity fluctuation @xmath179 depends on the orthogonal / unitary matrix @xmath172 and the statistical matrix @xmath180 .",
    "clearly , @xmath172 converges to an identity matrix for sufficiently _ small _ @xmath2 , while for _ large _ enough @xmath2 and sufficiently complex perturbation @xmath12 one may assume that it becomes a random orthogonal / unitary matrix . of course , the critical perturbation strength @xmath181 for a transition between the two regimes is very much system dependent and can not be discussed in general .",
    "let us now discuss three different limiting cases of the statistical matrix @xmath180 : +   + * ( i ) * first , consider the simplest case where the initial state is a pure eigenstate of @xmath6 say , @xmath182 .",

    "@xmath185 fidelity does not decay at all @xmath186 , while for _ strong perturbation _ @xmath187 we may estimate ( [ eq : frmsa ] ) using the fact that @xmath172 become real / complex gaussian random variables with variance @xmath188 for the orthogonal(@xmath189)/unitary(@xmath190 ) case , namely @xmath191^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "this result can be generalized to the case where initial state can be written as a finite superposition of a small number , say @xmath192 , of eigenstates of @xmath6 : then for a weak perturbation @xmath193 . with this simple observation",
    "we can easily explain the numerical result of peres @xcite where no - decay of fidelity was found for a coherent initial state sitting in the center of elliptic island , thus being a superposition of a very small number of eigenstates ( it is almost an eigenstate ) , while the behavior in generic cases may be drastically different as described in the present work .",

    ". however , except for the pathological case of initial state being a small combination of eigenstates of @xmath6 with weak perturbation , the fidelity fluctuation is always between the limiting values @xmath204 , and @xmath205 . for an illustrations of transitions between weak and strong perturbations in case ( iii ) of a kicked top , see fig .",

    "in this section we wish to contrast the surprising findings on the stability of quantum motion with an application of the general idea ( section 2 ) to a fully classical concept , namely to ( unitary ) perron - frobenius propagator of classical phase space densities .",

    "the reason for this lies in an essentially different form of the generator of perturbation ( [ eq : acl ] ) which in classical case involves phase space derivatives invoking the stability matrix , while in quantum mechanics it is a simple quantization of the observable @xmath465 .",
    "now , observe that the classical linear response formula ( [ eq : fcl2 ] ) gives precisely the same result as one intuitively expects based on the stability of individual orbits . indeed , in the case of chaotic dynamics , the integrand ( for sufficiently long times @xmath43 ) becomes dominated by the leading eigenvalue of the stability matrix @xmath495 , namely the largest lyapunov exponent @xmath67 , and ( [ eq : fcl2 ] ) can be written as @xmath496 where the unspecified constant depends on the initial distribution @xmath473 .",

    "the main result of the paper is a simple linear response ( or kubo - like ) formula ( [ eq : f2nd ] ) which relates the fidelity decay to the total sum ( or integral ) of two point time autocorrelation function of the generator of perturbation . in the limit of infinite hilbert space dimension we found _ exponential _ fidelity decay on a time - scale @xmath500 , for _ quantum ergodic and mixing _ systems , whereas for _ non - ergodic _",

    "interestingly , finite size fluctuations of fidelity ( for very long times at a finite hilbert space dimension ) have been shown to be given by the _",
    "inverse participation ratio _ of the eigenstates of the perturbed evolution operator in the eigenbasis of the unperturbed propagator .",
    "the surprising aspects of our relations are mainly due to non - interchangability of the limits @xmath5 and @xmath4 as the relevant decay time - scales are only functions of the ratio @xmath504 .",
    "therefore , a different and intuitively expected behaviour , namely faster fidelity decay for mixing than regular dynamics , is obtained in the ` classical ' regime where @xmath505 ( or making the limit @xmath4 prior to @xmath5 ) . a similar",
    ", reassuring result has been found by applying our formalism to inspect the analogous classical fidelity for the unitary perron - frobenius evolution of volume ( area ) preserving maps : there the classical fidelity for regular dynamics has been found to decay on a time - scale @xmath38 , while for a chaotic dynamics , the fidelity decay is governed by a maximal lyapunov exponent @xmath67 on a short time - scale @xmath506 .",
    "we note that our findings should be of primary importance for understanding the problem of stability of quantum computation @xcite where different regimes and time - scales @xcite should now be explained in terms of intrinsic dynamics of a particular quantum algorithm .",
    "actually , our relation between fidelity and correlation decay may prove very useful in design of any new technology which is aimed at manipulating individual quantum states .",
    "on the other hand , our results may also shed new light on the relation between decoherence and dynamics @xcite .",
    "in particular , due to quite special role of coherent initial states on the short ehrenfest time - scale one may expect the results to be quite different for a random initial state and/or for longer time - scales ( see @xcite ) .",
