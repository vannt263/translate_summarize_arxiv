    "hadron production from energetic jets in high - energy nuclear collisions is often parameterized through fragmentation functions using the universality of the process as given by qcd factorization theorems @xcite . on a more microscopic level",
    ", one can achieve a good description of jet hadronization through a perturbative evolution of the parton spectrum inside the jet using dglap splitting kernels from the largest momentum scale to some lower cutoff @xmath2 , followed by a non - perturbative hadronization model like the lund string model applied to the parton shower .",
    "the event generator pythia @xcite has succesfully implemented such a strategy to describe hadron production in @xmath0 collisions at high energies and in numerous other processes .",
    "on the other hand , it has been suggested that hadron production can often be described through a process of quark recombination or coalescence @xcite .",
    "it is an intriguing idea to combine the concepts of quark recombination and parton showers since it would easily generalize to the hadronization of jets in dense environments as in relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "hwa and yang have pioneered the application of quark recombination to jet showers in ref .",
    "however , the parton showers in their work were not obtained from first principles but fitted to measured hadron spectra .",
    "they also ignored the smallness of the number of partons in each jet by applying recombination to averaged spectra instead of event - by - event showers .",
    "fluctuations from shower to shower are expected to lead to significant changes to the hadron spectrum at large hadron momentum fraction @xmath3 .",
    "using @xmath4 collisions as an example , we show that vacuum fragmentation functions can be reproduced in an event - by - event approach that uses a perturbative shower evolution in the vacuum down to a scale @xmath2 , a minimal modeling of non - perturbative effects on partons below @xmath2 , and finally recombination of the quarks and antiquarks into hadrons .",
    "using pythia 6.3 @xcite , we generate an ensemble of parton showers from @xmath5 collisions at center - of - mass energy @xmath1 .",
    "the light quark , strange quark and gluon spectra as functions of momentum at a cutoff scale @xmath6 are shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ gluondecaygraph ] .",
    "since gluons in the parton showers can not directly recombine into hadrons , we force them to decay into quark - antiquark pairs after the perturbative evolution is stopped .",
    "this is a non - perturbative process , and we use constituent quark masses of @xmath7 for light quarks and @xmath8 for strange quarks with the remaining gluon virtuality randomly chosen in the interval between @xmath9 and @xmath2 .",
    "the transverse momentum spectra of the decay light and strange quarks together with the total light and strange quark spectra are shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ gluondecaygraph ] .",
    "following the approach to quark recombination in ref .",
    "@xcite the probability for quarks and antiquarks to form a hadron is taken to be proportional to the quark wigner function of the hadron . assuming the quark wave functions of the hadrons to be those of harmonic oscillators , the hadron wigner function is then gaussian in both the coordinate and the momentum space . here",
    "we neglect spatial information , assuming shower partons with similar momenta to be close in space .",
    "hence we only consider the momentum - space wigner function .    for the production of a meson from a quark and an antiquark ,",
    "the probabilities are @xmath10 respectively for @xmath11-wave and @xmath12-wave mesons @xcite . here",
    "@xmath13 is the relative momentum between the quark and antiquark in the meson rest frame , @xmath14 is the width of the quark and antiquark relative momentum distribution in the meson , and @xmath15 is the statistical factor for the colored , spin-@xmath16 quark and antiquark to form a colorless meson . for the mesons @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 considered in our study , we have @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 . because of the color charge of a gluon , its decay quark and antiquark",
    "are excluded from recombining into a color singlet meson .    for @xmath11-wave baryons ,",
    "the production probability from three quarks is @xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the relative momenta of the recombining quarks of momenta @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 in the rest frame of the baryon .",
    "the statistical factors for the baryons @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath14 , and @xmath37 considered in our study are @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the momentum width @xmath14 is related to the oscillator constant in the quark wave function . here",
    "we take them as parameters .",
    "using @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 , we have calculated their respective transverse momentum spectra from the recombination of quarks and antiquarks on an event - by - event basis .",
    "the spectra of directly produced pions , kaons and nucleons are shown by star symbols in the left , middle , and right panels of fig .",
    "[ recomb ] , respectively .",
    "they underestimate those obtained from pythia via string fragmentation shown by solid lines . after including contributions from the decay of resonances via @xmath43",
    "we significantly improve the comparison with the pythia results as shown by the dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ recomb ] .",
    "we note that not all quarks and antiquarks are used in the recombination model to form hadrons . as shown in fig .",
    "[ probremn ] , the recombination probability is close to one for low momentum quarks and decreases with increasing momentum .",
    "the small number of non - recombined quarks thus consists mostly of leading quarks that are far removed in momentum space from the rest of the parton shower .",
    "their contribution to hadron production can be included via independent fragmentations at the low momentum scale @xmath2 . because of their small numbers , the final hadron spectra are , however , not much affected .",
    "our study indicates that hadron production from jets can be described by the recombination of shower partons inside the jets .",
    "our approach provides a promising framework to study the medium modification of fragmentation functions in the presence of a quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) by allowing shower partons to recombine with the thermal partons in the qgp .",
