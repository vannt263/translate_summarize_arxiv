    "<S> virtual effects induced by new physics in rare @xmath0 decays are reviewed . </S>",
    "<S> since the expected sensitivity of the giga@xmath0 linear collider is of the order of 10@xmath1 , we emphasize the importance of any new physics effect that gives a prediction above this limit . </S>",
    "<S> it is also pointed out that an improvement on the known experimental constraints on rare @xmath0 decays will provide us with a critical test of the validity of the standard model at the loop level . </S>"
