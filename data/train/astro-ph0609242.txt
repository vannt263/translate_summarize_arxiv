    "this is manifest only in saturn s case , where a pair of moons  janus and epimetheus  occupy nearly identical orbits that are interchanged every 4 years , causing the resonance locations in the rings to skip back and forth by tens of km . since spiral density waves are initiated in saturn s rings at locations where ring particle orbits are in a lindblad resonance with a perturbing moon , the starting points of waves jump as well , allowing wave trains to interfere in complex ways @xcite .",

    "examination of the cassini images to date shows that density waves raised by the co - orbitals are both unusual and variable in their morphology . in this paper , we describe a model that accounts for much of the observed structure . we proceed to use this model to predict the future morphology of selected waves at the times and locations of planned cassini observations , which we expect will test our predictions .",

    "when viewed in a rotating frame of reference , whose angular velocity equals the mass - weighted average of the mean motions of the two moons , epimetheus executes a modified `` horseshoe orbit '' encompassing janus slowly drifting @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 lagrange points ( fig .",

    ", @xmath20 is on the order of 10 - 20  km / yr . since spiral density waves commonly propagate over many tens of km , and the forcing from the co - orbital satellites changes every 4 yr , discontinuities resulting from reversal events should be observable in density waves raised by the co - orbitals .",
    "in the radial scans of ring brightness taken from cassini  iss images ( ) , spiral density waves due to the co - orbitals can be discerned at first - order , second - order , and third - order resonances .",

    "since the density perturbations comprising these weaker waves are much smaller than the background surface density , they remain well - described by linear theory , and overlapping wave segments can be simply superposed . accordingly , second - order waves are best - suited for comparison with our simple model , and we will focus exclusively on them .    additionally , several third - order co - orbital waves can be discerned through wavelet analysis of the radial scans ( ) ; however , these are too weak for much detailed structure to be resolved .",
    "our model is based on a simple assumption : when the co - orbital satellites are in a given configuration ( we ll call the janus - inward configuration `` je '' and the janus - outward configuration `` ej '' ) , spiral density waves propagate outward from the current lindblad resonance locations at the group velocity @xmath20 . when a reversal occurs ( e.g. , the satellites changing configurations from je to ej ) , the je resonance locations become inactive ; however , the waves previously generated there continue to propagate outwards , resulting in a `` headless '' wave .",

    "the absolute navigation of iss images is not simple ( see ) ; nonetheless , all that is necessary for wave morphology is to know the separations among the resonance locations .",
    "the phase of each wave segment ( eq .  [ dwphase ] ) is determined by what the orbital parameters of the perturbing moon _ would have been _ had no reversal taken place .",

    "we make a linear fit to @xmath15 and to @xmath16 over a single inter - reversal time period , then extrapolate forward to the observation time .    at the end of this process ,",
    "the only remaining free parameters in our model are the background surface density @xmath4 and the damping parameter @xmath7 , which respectively control the wavelength dispersion and the propagation distance .",

    "another potentially interesting explanation for such oscillations is that a leading spiral density wave may be propagating back towards the resonance location @xcite .",
