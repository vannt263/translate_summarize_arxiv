    "the planets have two main types of satellite ( peale 1999 ) .",
    "regular satellites have nearly circular , low inclination , prograde orbits .",
    "these satellites probably formed within a disk of gas and dust around the planet analogous to the disk from which the planets formed around the sun .",
    "irregular satellites have large , eccentric orbits that are usually highly inclined and even retrograde relative to the equatorial plane of their planets .",
    "these irregular satellites can not have formed by circumplanetary accretion .",
    "instead , they were probably captured from heliocentric orbit during the epoch of formation of the planets ( kuiper 1956 ; pollack , burns & tauber 1979 ) .",
    "permanent satellites are confined to the region of gravitational influence , known as the hill sphere .",
    "the hill sphere radius is @xmath0^{1/3 } \\label{eq : hill}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the semi - major axis and mass of the planet and @xmath3 is the mass of the sun . from equation  [ eq : hill ] and using a mass for mars of @xmath4 kg , the mass of the sun as @xmath5 kg and data from table  1 we find that mars hill sphere is about 0.71 degrees in radius which corresponds to about 1.6 square degrees in area as seen from the earth during our observations .",
    "the availability of sensitive , large scale charge - coupled device ( ccd ) detectors has refreshed the study of irregular satellites by enabling a new wave of discovery around jupiter ( sheppard & jewitt 2003 ) , saturn ( gladman et al . 2001 ) , uranus ( gladman et al . 2000 ) and neptune ( holman et al .",
    "2003 ; sheppard et al .",
    "large fields of view are needed because the hill spheres are large .",
    "sensitivity is needed because the majority of irregular satellites are small and therefore faint . from these new surveys",
    "it appears that the four giant planets possess about the same number of irregular satellites and groupings with no dependence on the planet s mass when comparing them to the same limiting size of satellites ( sheppard and jewitt 2003 ) . for an in depth review of irregular satellites",
    "see jewitt , sheppard & porco ( 2004 ) .",
    "mars is known to have two small inner satellites , phobos and deimos ( hall 1878 ) .",
    "the origins of these satellites are still a mystery .",
    "their orbits are not like the irregular satellites of the giant planets since they are close to mars and have nearly zero eccentricity and inclination .",
    "mars satellites , from a dynamical perspective , appear to have originated not far from their current positions since it is hard to produce orbits like those of the known martian satellites by capture . on the other hand ,",
    "the physical properties of phobos and deimos resemble those of c - type asteroids of which most are found in the outer main belt , not near mars . based on their physical characteristics",
    "they may be captured asteroids .",
    "in addition , the current orbit of phobos is short - lived and the satellite will collide with the planet on a timescale @xmath6 yr ( see burns ( 1992 ) and references therein ) .",
    "kuiper ( 1961 ) briefly reviewed some early photographic searches for outer satellites of mars .",
    "these surveys only reached a photographic magnitude of about 17 mag ( about 1.4 km in diameter assuming an albedo of 0.05 ) .",
    "the viking orbiter 1 spacecraft found no new satellites of mars larger than about 0.05 km within the orbit of phobos ( duxbury & ocampo 1988 ) .",
    "showalter , hamilton & nicholson ( 2001 ) used the hubble space telescope ( hst ) to search for possible mars dust rings created by phobos and deimos that have been predicted by soter ( 1971 ) .",
    "they did not detect any dust rings or unknown satellites down to about 0.1 km in diameter ( assuming an albedo of 0.07 ) in the very inner portions of mars space near phobos and deimos .",
    "the hst observations have not been published , but the small field - of - view ( a few arcminutes ) in any case allowed them to survey only the very inner portion of the hill sphere of mars . in this sense ,",
    "our survey is complementary to theirs .",
    "only the giant planets have been found to possess abundant irregular satellites .",
    "are the distant irregular satellites unique to the giant planets or does the outermost terrestrial planet , mars , have them as well ? like jupiter and neptune , mars has trojan asteroids in its leading and trailing lagrangian regions which might have been captured in a similar way as irregular satellites ( marzari et al .",
    "2002 ) . with modern wide - field digital detectors on medium class telescopes we can now survey",
    "the space around mars to much fainter magnitudes than the early photographic surveys . in this paper",
    "we describe such a survey in which we used a wide - field digital detector to perform a search of the martian hill sphere for satellites several magnitudes fainter than previously achieved .",
    "we used the canada - france - hawaii 3.6 meter diameter telescope atop mauna kea in hawaii with the megacam digital ccd camera for imaging ( boulade et al .",
    "the megacam has 36 separate ccds with each having @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) pixels , which at prime focus gives @xmath9 pixel@xmath10 scale .",
    "the total number of pixels is about 340 million and each image was about 710 megabytes in size .",
    "the field - of - view is @xmath11 degrees with gaps of about @xmath12 between most chips ( though a few have gaps of about @xmath13 ) .",
    "megacam uses a wide field corrector in order to produce uniform image quality across the field of view .",
    "images were obtained by staff observers in queue scheduling mode . an r filter based on the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss )",
    "filter set was used .",
    "the images were bias subtracted and then flat - fielded using twilight flats . during exposures the telescope was autoguided sidereally on bright nearby stars .",
    "the nights were photometric and the seeing was about @xmath14 during the observations .",
    "integration times were 100 seconds on july 5 and 120 seconds on july 7 .",
    "the observing geometry and characteristics of mars at the time of observations are shown in table  1 .",
    "figure  1 shows the area searched around mars for possible satellites .",
    "the entire outer martian hill sphere was covered on each night of ut july 5 and 7 , 2003 .",
    "four fields were imaged 3 times each on both nights for a total of 24 images . on a given night , the images of each field were separated by about 13.5 minutes giving 27 minutes between the first and last images .",
    "a computer program was used to identify objects which were detected in all three images from one night and had a motion within @xmath15 arcseconds per hour of mars motion in both right ascension and declination .",
    "this motion is consistent with parallactic displacement of an object moving near mars .",
    "there was no confusion with main belt asteroids since they tend to stay away from mars orbit and mars was near perihelion during the observations .",
    "each night was photometric and landolt ( 1992 ) standards were used to calibrate the data .",
    "the apparent red limiting magnitude of the survey was found by placing artificially generated objects with motions similar to mars into the survey fields .",
    "the artificial objects had a range of magnitudes and were matched to the point spread function of the images in the north - south direction ( fwhm @xmath16 arcseconds ) and were elongated in the east - west direction to simulate the slight trailing any real satellites would have incurred ( @xmath17 arcseconds ) during the exposure .",
    "the @xmath18 differential detection efficiency for artificial moving objects in the survey fields was found at an r - band magnitude of about @xmath19 mags .",
    "figure  [ fig : eff ] shows the differential detection efficiency of the search program versus limiting red magnitude .",
    "the multiple nights of observations which would only help increase our detection rate were not factored into the efficiency .",
    "the above results apply when no significant amount of scattered light was present .",
    "figures  [ fig : areamars ] and [ fig : contour ] show the behavior of the scattered light near mars .",
    "scattered light was noticed up to about 20 arcminutes from mars .",
    "figure  [ fig : effbright ] shows the @xmath18 r - band limiting magnitude of the program versus the distance from mars .",
    "we found no new satellites of mars to limiting apparent red magnitude of 23.5 mag ( figure  [ fig : areamars ] ) . in order to determine the corresponding size limit we relate the apparent red magnitude of an object , @xmath20 , to its radius , @xmath21 , through @xmath22^{1/2 } 10^{0.2(m_{\\odot } - m_{r } ) } \\label{eq : appmag}\\ ] ] in which @xmath21 is in km , @xmath23 is the heliocentric distance in au , @xmath24 is the geocentric distance in au , @xmath25 is the apparent red magnitude of the sun ( @xmath26 ) , @xmath27 is the geometric red albedo , and @xmath28 is the phase function in which the phase angle @xmath29 deg at opposition . for linear phase functions we use the notation @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the `` linear '' phase coefficient .",
    "if we use data from table  1 , a phase coefficient of @xmath32 mags per degree and assume the albedo is 0.07 we find that an apparent magnitude of 23.5 corresponds to objects that are about 0.09 km in radius at mars distance . with this kind of sensitivity",
    "we would have easily detected any phobos ( @xmath33 km ) or deimos ( @xmath34 km ) sized satellites in our fields .",
    "the survey covered @xmath35 of mars hill sphere . only the inner @xmath36 arcminutes ( @xmath37 ) near mars were not covered in our survey due to scattered light from the planet .",
    "mars lack of outer satellites compared to the giant planets is shown in figure  [ fig : irrsats ] and table  2 . by comparing mars hill sphere to the giant planets we would expect to find outer irregular satellites much more distant than phobos and deimos . why are there no known irregular satellites around the terrestrial planets ?",
    "previous authors have found that the inner terrestrial planets mercury and venus probably have no satellites because of the consequence of strong solar tides which would make them unstable ( counselman 1973 ; ward & reid 1973 ; burns 1973 ) . the earth and mars",
    "are spared extreme solar tides .",
    "the earth might have lost small outer satellites due to the presence of the large moon ( callegari & yokoyama 2001 ) .",
    "there are two basic reasons why mars may have no irregular satellites .",
    "either such objects are dynamically unstable on timescales comparable to or less than the age of the solar system or mars lacked any mechanism to capture irregular satellites in the first place .",
    "the proximity of mars to jupiter may limit distant stable orbits about mars .",
    "the role of these perturbations on long timescales and as a function of location within mars hill sphere is still yet to be fully explored .",
    "analysis of main - belt asteroid satellite stability shows that the sun is the dominant perturber for asteroids in the mid to inner main belt while jovian perturbations become dominant in the outer main - belt ( chauvineau & mignard 1990 ) .",
    "extrapolation to mars suggests that satellites may be stable for a significant portion of the hill sphere for the age of the solar system .",
    "alternatively , the deficiency of irregular satellites around mars may arise from the difference in the formation process of mars compared to the giant planets .",
    "irregular satellite capture for the giant planets probably occurred towards the end of the planet s formation epoch where the energy dissipation needed for capture could be caused by gas drag from an extended atmosphere , the enlargement of the hill sphere caused by the planet s mass growth and/or higher collision probabilities with nearby small bodies ( kuiper 1956 ; colombo & franklin 1971 ; heppenheimer & porco 1977 ; pollack et al .",
    "1979 ) . unlike the giant planets ,",
    "mars is not expected to have gone through a significant hill sphere enlargement from a large mass accretion event or to have had a dense extended atmosphere during formation .",
    "no outer satellites of mars larger than about 0.09 km in radius were detected in our survey which covered @xmath35 of mars hill sphere ( from @xmath38 to over 0.7 degrees from the planet ) .",
    "the absence of outer satellites around mars may indicate it did not have the right conditions for irregular satellite capture as did the giant planets during their formation or may show that such objects are dynamically unstable , or both .",
    "we thank jing li for help on idl contour plotting , francesco marzari for a prompt review and the cfht queue service observing team for proficient data handling .",
    "this work was supported by a grant to dj from nasa .",
    "the canada - france - hawaii telescope is operated by the national research council of canada , le centre national de la recherche scientifique de france , and the university of hawaii ."
