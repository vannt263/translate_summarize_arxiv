    "the default threshold value of ring a ( @xmath63v for the experiment and 0.05 for the simulation ) was set much lower than that of ring b ( @xmath64v for the experiment and 0.20 for the simulation ) , which forces ring a to be more likely to fire than ring b. if the input signal amplitude or mean pulse input rate is large enough to fire ring b , then output a is depressed .",
    "even if the input signal decreases to subthreshold for ring b , ring b reverberates for a while due to its transient nature .",
    "but ring a is disinhibited after the rest of ring b. in such a system , we can define a two - dimensional attractor as ( @xmath65 , @xmath66 ) in the phase space , where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the firing rates of rings a and b , respectively .    the application of noise with an appropriate amplitude endows the electronic circuit with a hysteresis effect ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]b ) , and the numerical simulation of the device qualitatively reproduced this experimental tendency ( fig . [ fig4]a ) .",
    "interestingly , noise with an appropriate amplitude ( see the curves for @xmath67 and @xmath68v in fig . [ fig3]b and for @xmath69 and @xmath70 in fig .",

    "the hysteresis effect is due to the noise - driven transient memory storage effect of ring b and the asymmetric inhibitory connection . during the down - sweeping process of the input signal amplitude ,",
    "the switching voltage becomes much lower than @xmath71 because of the above - mentioned reverberation of ring b. during the up - sweeping process , the onset voltage of the firing of ring b can be determined only by @xmath71 and the noise amplitude , giving a higher switching voltage than that of the down - sweeping process .",

    ".    the results shown by the simple threshold system and the canonical model of a class 1 neural network are phenomenologically consistent with recent results showing hysteresis effects in stereopsis and binocular rivalry in humans@xcite . in the literature",
    ", hysteresis is measured as a function of orientation disparity in tilted gratings in which a transition is perceived between stereopsis and binocular rivalry . a fast tilting rate , which corresponds to high - frequency input in our case , results in enhancement of coercivity .",
    "furthermore , a smaller optical michelson contrast of a sinusoidal grating causes a larger coercivity .",
    "a previous functional magnetic resonance imaging study concerning a general mechanism for perceptual decision - making indicated that several brain regions associated with the attentional network show a greater response when the task becomes more difficult@xcite .",
    "since a test with a smaller grating contrast involves a more difficult task , the region requires more attentional resources for correct performance ; that is , the number of neurons ( corresponding to @xmath4 ) associated with the task could be larger .",
