    "the concept of dwarf galaxy was firstly introduced in a publication of the kapteyn astronomical laboratory just few months after the astronomical community accepted the idea of galaxies outside the milky way . by 1936",
    "there were at least three dwarf ( or under luminous ) galaxies in local group ( hubble 1936 ) . in the next two decades",
    "another nine dwarf galaxies were discovered in the local group , but also in other groups of galaxies , as m81 and m101 ( hodge 1958 ) .",
    "it was claimed that dwarf galaxies was discovered in the virgo cluster .",
    "reaves ( 1956 ) classified four galaxies of the virgo cluster as dwarf spiral galaxies , although he said that `` the existence of these objects has not been established '' and their existence `` is inferred by analogy with the dwarf variants of normal elliptical and spirals '' .",
    "but , when in the late 50s de vaucouleurs reorganised the hubble sequence , the terminology dwarf spiral galaxy almost disappeared from the literature . because of their scarcity , they were included in the new types of spiral galaxies , as sd and sm .",
    "few years later , nilson ( 1973 ) used this terminology , as ds , to classify @xmath1 of the galaxies in the uppsala general catalog . from this time to 1995 most of the references to dwarf spiral galaxies were to deny their existence ( e.g. edmunds & roy 1993 ) .",
    "actually , drinkwater & hardy ( 1989 ) worried about the missing dwarf spiral galaxies of the virgo cluster .",
    "sandage et al .",
    "( 1985 ) , from their study of the luminosity function in the virgo cluster , claimed that although there were previous evidence of small sm galaxies , none sa to sc dwarf galaxy was ever discovered .",
    "finally , schombert et al . (",
    "1995 ) discovered six small galaxies with distinct bulge and disc components , low surface brightness , blue colours and flocculent spiral patterns which they classified as early - type dwarf spiral galaxies .",
    "the properties of the late - type ds ( or small size sm galaxies ) were discussed deeply in hidalgo - gmez ( 2004 ; hereafter hg04 ) .",
    "a total of @xmath2 galaxies classified as late - type spirals , with optical radius smaller than @xmath3 kpc and absolute magnitude lower than @xmath4 were found .",
    "their colours were bluer than normal - size sm but their star formation rates were very low ( reyes - prez & hidalgo - gmez 2008 ) .",
    "very few of the ds galaxies in the hidalgo - gmez s sample might be located inside clusters or group of galaxies but the number of barred galaxies is higher that for normal sm galaxies , probably due to their small sizes which make them very unstable dynamically .",
    "few of these ds galaxies show a clear spiral pattern . instead , torn off arms are observed , not well defined and most of the time only one arm is detected . from the abundances of nine ds galaxies",
    "it was concluded that the oxygen abundances were similar or smaller than the values for the lmc ( see table 4 in hg04 ) .",
    "hidalgo - gmez & olofsson ( 2002 ) determined that the integrated oxygen abundances of i m compared to sm galaxies from the classical work of mccall et al .",
    "( 1985 ) is smaller by @xmath5 dex .",
    "one can think that such differences are not very large .",
    "actually , they are within @xmath6@xmath7 uncertainties of the measurements , as stated in table 4 in hidalgo - gmez & oloffson ( 2002 ) . in recent years",
    ", the abundance has been determined for another nine ds galaxies and the results were that most of them have low , or very low , abundances , lower than 12+log(o / h ) = @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , the range of abundances encompasses by the so far studied from a sample of @xmath8 ds galaxies is very similar to these of i m and normal sm galaxies ( see table 9 and table 4 in hidalgo - gmez 2004 ) .",
    "this is not expected because of the , a priori , different star formation histories in these types of galaxies .",
    "it is supposed that the star formation ( sf ) in spiral galaxies is continuous due to the dynamical spiral arms , while it proceeds on burst , separated by @xmath9 years , in i m galaxies ( carroll & ostlie 2007 ) . therefore , the metal content should be larger in the former than in the latter if the same imf works at both type of galaxies . moreover , these two types seems to have different environments ( hg04 ) , which might influence the star formation rates . then , it might be of the outmost importance to understand such coincidence in the metallicity range .",
    "if this hold when more galaxies are included , different conclusions can be attained : the spiral arms of the sm and ds might not be dynamical and they do not influence the sf ; or the imf differs for i m galaxies , favouring the existence of a large number massive stars , which produce and release heavier elements as oxygen . or all these galaxies are really the same kind of galaxies , and the classification scheme is so much detailed . or some other differences in the evolution of the late - type galaxies . therefore , a larger sample of abundance for late - type galaxies must be considered before any further speculation on their evolution .    the main goal of this investigation is to increase the number of ds galaxies with spectroscopic information and metallicity determination .",
    "therefore , four newer ds galaxies were observed and their oxygen abundances determined , for which not previous values have been reported . in a companion paper ( hidalgo - gmez et al .",
    ", aj submitted ; hereafter paper ii ) , the existence of oxygen abundance gradients is studied . in the following , the basic information for the galaxies in the sub sample studied here is presented .",
    "also , a summary of this information is presented in table 1 .",
    "ugc 5242 is a barred galaxy with an optical size of @xmath10 kpc and located at a distance of @xmath11 mpc ( hg04 ) .",
    "despite to be at the vorontson - velyaminov catalogue ( 1974 ) , it is not classified as a peculiar or interacting galaxy",
    ". it does not show disturbances in its morphology , although the spiral structure is not very well defined as clearly seen in the optical images ( those obtained by one of the authors or those provided by sloan ) .",
    "as several hii regions are clearly seen in the h@xmath12 image this galaxy is a perfect candidate to study the oxygen abundance .",
    "ugc 5296 is one of the smallest galaxies in the sample of hg04 with an optical radius of only @xmath13 kpc .",
    "the absolute magnitude is also small , @xmath14 if a distance of @xmath15 mpc is adopted . despite its important amount of gas ,",
    "@xmath16 10@xmath17 m@xmath18 , only five hii regions are clearly distinguished in an h@xmath12 image of the galaxy .",
    "no spiral pattern can be distinguished in the galaxy in the h@xmath12 , v or r images despite being classified as sm ( nilson 1973 ) .",
    "ugc 6205 is , on the contrary , one of the largest galaxies in the ds sample with an optical radius of @xmath19 kpc , but with a low gas mass , only @xmath20 m@xmath18 , and a low luminosity , m@xmath21 = @xmath22 at a distance of @xmath23 mpc .",
    "the spiral structure of this galaxy does not show any disturbance in all the bands ( v , r and h@xmath12 ) we observed . actually , this galaxy display the best spiral structure out of the four galaxies studied here , with several hii regions visible in the h@xmath12 image taken previously to the spectra .",
    "ugc 6377 is one of @xmath1 galaxies classified as dwarf spirals in the uppsala general catalog ( nilson 1973 ) .",
    "very little information is available for this galaxy .",
    "if a distance of @xmath24 mpc is considered , m@xmath21 is about @xmath25 .",
    "again , the h@xmath12 image showed several hii regions but not clear spiral structure .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following : the description on the acquisition of the data and the reduction processes is presented in the next section . in section 3 a discussion on the abundance methods is presented .",
    "the values of the oxygen abundances for each hii regions are presented in section 4 while a discussion on them is presented in section 5 .",
    "conclusions are given in section 6 .",
    "first of all , it has to be said that the sample of galaxies observed and presented here did not suffer any selection before observations , not due to the number of hii regions detected or a more clear ( or fuzzy ) spiral pattern .",
    "the only selection criteria were the coordinates and the hour angle at the precise moment of the observations .",
    "actually , this was on purpose in order not to include any bias which might make these galaxies different from the rest of the galaxies in table 1 of hg04 .",
    "in fact , they cover a large range in properties , as seen in table 1 , being a very representative sample of ds galaxies .    the spectra on which this investigation is based on were acquired on 2002 march 10  -  11 with the 2.1 m telescope of the observatorio astronmico nacional at san pedro mrtir ( mexico ) .",
    "the boller & chives spectrograph was used with a @xmath26 line mm@xmath27 grating blazed at 5000  .",
    "the detector was a site3 ccd with @xmath28 @xmath29 pixels in a 1024@xmath301024 format .",
    "the slit length was @xmath3 arcmin and the width was @xmath31 @xmath29 m , subtending @xmath32 2 arcsec on the sky , and yielding a spectral resolution of @xmath33 .",
    "the pixel scale along the spatial direction was @xmath34 .",
    "the full spectral range observed was @xmath35  . during the two nights the weather conditions were good but not completely photometric .",
    "the seeing was about @xmath36 most of the time .",
    "a summary of the observing conditions and log of observations is shown in table 2 .",
    "no correction for differential refraction was performed , as the airmasses were , in all cases , smaller than @xmath37 but for the last slit position of ugc 6377 . actually , the integration time of the two last positions in this galaxy was small due to the rapid increase of the airmass .",
    "the orientation of the slits were east - west and parallel to each other for the galaxies ugc 5242 and ugc 6377 and north - south for the galaxies ugc 6205 and ugc 5296 .",
    "the reduction of the data was performed with the vista software package , an automatic procedure developed at lick observatory at mid - eighties and often updated by one of the authors ( j.j .",
    "gnzalez ) .",
    "bias and sky twilight flat - fields were used to calibrate the ccd response .",
    "several exposures of a given slit position facilitated the removal of cosmic rays .",
    "he - ar lamps were used for the wavelength calibration and geometric deflections corrections .",
    "the spectra were corrected for atmospheric extinction using the san pedro mrtir tables ( schuster & parrao 2001 ) .",
    "the flux calibration was performed using several standard stars , observed each night at different airmasses .",
    "the flux accuracy was of the order of 5@xmath38 .",
    "finally , the number and extension of the hii regions were determined .",
    "to do so , the forbidden oxygen line [ oiii]@xmath395007     was used .",
    "a final spectra for each hii region was created summing up all the rows where this line was observed .",
    "the next step is to correct these spectra for absorption and extinction .",
    "the usual procedure for the absorption correction is to increase the equivalent width of @xmath40 by @xmath41     ( e.g. mccall et al . 1985 ) .",
    "however , the differences in the intensity of the absorption corrected line ratios and the non - absorption corrected ones were of @xmath42 when no clear absorption features are presented in the spectra ( hidalgo - gmez 2007 ) .",
    "such differences are of the same order as the error due to the poisson noise and , therefore , not significant uncertainties were introduced if the absorption correction is not performed .",
    "the extinction correction was performed using the extinction coefficient , defined as @xmath43    where @xmath44 is the theoretical balmer decrement at @xmath45 k for case b of recombination ( brocklehurts 1971 ) , @xmath46 is the whitford modified extinction law ( savage & mathis 1979 ) , and @xmath47 is the observed h@xmath12/h@xmath48 ratio . when this ratio is smaller than the canonical value @xmath44 , the extinction coefficient was set to zero , as usual .",
    "the intensities of the lines detected in each spectrum were measured with two different softwares : vista and the subroutine alice in midas .",
    "the first one detected and measured the lines by an automatic procedure which know the wavelength of few spectral lines , while a more `` manual - visual '' procedure is used in alice .",
    "the software at vista could be used only for two of the galaxies studied here , ugc 5242 and ugc 5296 .",
    "all the lines were measured twice with alice .",
    "if the two values differed by more than @xmath49 , a third measurement was carried out in order to obtained the most reliable value of the intensity .",
    "this was normally the case for low signal - to - noise ( s / n ) lines .",
    "a normalisation to the intensity of h@xmath48 was performed , as usual .",
    "the uncertainty for each line was obtained from the quadrature of the uncertainties in the reduction procedure ( @xmath50 ) , in the extinction correction ( @xmath51 ) and in poisson noise ( @xmath52 ) . from this set of intensities",
    "the abundances of oxygen can be determined .",
    "a total of @xmath53 hii regions were detected in the four galaxies observed : @xmath1 regions in ugc 6205 , @xmath54 in ugc 6377 , @xmath33 in ugc 5242 and only @xmath55 in ugc 5296 .",
    "the regions were named with a letter indicating the slit position and a number increasing from south to north ( or east to west in ugc 6205 and ugc 5296 ) . in two of the regions of ugc 5242 only the h@xmath12 line was detected and in one of the ugc 6205 regions the h@xmath48 line was absent .",
    "therefore , the abundances can be determined in only @xmath56 of the hii regions observed .",
    "the auroral line of oxygen at @xmath57   was not detected in any except one of the regions and , therefore , the abundances can not be determined with the standard method ( aller 1984 ; osterbrock 1989 ) for @xmath58 of the hii regions .    in any case",
    ", the most important caveat concerning this set of data is the lack of the forbidden oxygen doublet at @xmath59   ( hereafter , @xmath393727 ) due to the low efficiency of the spectrograph at the blue end . without the intensity of these lines ,",
    "the oxygen abundances can not be determined for more than half of the regions , @xmath60 out of the total @xmath56 hii regions .",
    "therefore , it might be interesting to find out any way to obtain information on the intensity of the [ oii ] doublet",
    ". this could be through the relationship between the intensities of [ oiii]@xmath395007   and [ oii]@xmath393727 .",
    "such relationship can be obtained directly from photoionization models ( martn - manjn et al .",
    "2008 ) and it has been used as a diagnostic diagram ( e.g. baldwin et al .",
    "1981 ) . in the present investigation",
    ", we used the relationship obtained from a sample of @xmath61 star forming galaxies by kniazev et al .",
    ". such relationship , which is shown in figure  [ fig1 ] , follows the equation    @xmath62 \\over h\\beta } = -2.82~ log({[oiii ] \\over h\\beta})^2 + 2.39~ log({[oiii ] \\over h\\beta } ) - 0.0542\\ ] ]    with a rather large dispersion , of around @xmath63 .",
    "kobulnicky et al .",
    "( 1999 ) proposed a similar procedure for high redshift galaxies , for which the oxygen line [ oiii]@xmath395007 is not detected .",
    "they did not give any equation to compare with but they obtained a similar plot in both , shape and dispersion , to the one in figure  [ fig1 ] . although the dispersion of such relationship is large , a value for the intensity of the [ oii]@xmath393727 can be obtained and , therefore , the abundances for all the hii regions can be determined with confidence .    the next step is to derive the oxygen abundances .",
    "as previously said , the so - called standard method can not be used due to the lack of the auroral lines in the spectra .",
    "therefore , the semi empirical methods should be used instead .",
    "four different semi empirical methods were used here to determine the oxygen abundances . in hidalgo - gmez & ramrez - fuentes ( 2009 ) , the accuracy of two of these methods were studied .",
    "they were focussed on the r@xmath64 ( pagel et al .",
    "1979 ; mcgaugh 1994 ) and the @xmath65 method ( pilyugin 2000 ; 2001 ; pilyugin & thuan 2005 ) because their sample did not have the intensities of the nitrogen lines .",
    "although the new calibration of the @xmath65 method gives values of the metallicity closer to those obtained with the standard method in general , the differences with the r@xmath64 method are not that impressive and , therefore , it can not be concluded that @xmath65 method s values are preferred . for a deeper discussion on this issue the reader",
    "is referred to the original paper by hidalgo - gmez & ramrez - fuentes ( 2009 ) .",
    "the main problem with these two semi empirical methods is that there are bi - valuated .",
    "this means that there are two zones of metallicity for the same value of @xmath66+[oiii]$ ] intensity . for the @xmath67 method they are the so - called low - metallicity branch and high - metallicity branch ( edmunds & pagel 1984 ) . in the case of the @xmath65 method",
    ", there are two different equations for the abundance determination : one for abundance values lower than @xmath0 and other for values larger than this .",
    "therefore , we must establish an `` a priori '' criterion in order to determine in which of these two regions the abundance of the hii region under studied is .",
    "the most widely criterion used is based on the log([nii]/[oii ] ) ratio . when this ratio is higher than @xmath68 , the region is considered of high metallicity .",
    "given the uncertainties in the [ oii ] intensities described before , this ratio could be lower ( or higher ) than @xmath68 and the region is on the high ( or low ) metallicity branch .",
    "moreover , for those regions where the abundances can be obtained from other methods , they will be used as a guess on the metallicity branch . in this sample , the nitrogen line at @xmath69    is detected only in half of the regions .",
    "therefore , the location on the metallicity branch is not straightforward for half of the sample .",
    "the other two methods used in the determination of the oxygen abundances in these hii region are based on the nitrogen line .",
    "the relation between the oxygen abundance and the [ nii]/h@xmath12 ratio ( hereafter the @xmath70 method ) was recently calibrated by denicol et al .",
    "also , the calibration proposed by pettini & pagel ( 2004 ) based on the @xmath71/h\\alpha \\over [ oiii]/h\\beta})$ ] ratio and the oxygen abundances ( hereafter , @xmath72 ) is considered .",
    "the precision of these two methods was not studied by hidalgo - gmez & ramrez - fuentes ( 2009 ) and therefore , we are going to relay on the total uncertainties determined by denicol et al . and",
    "pettini & pagel , respectively .",
    "the typical uncertainty is , in both cases , about @xmath5 dex .",
    "a final concern about the semi empirical methods is their dependence on other parameters besides the oxygen abundances such as the ionization temperature ( olofsson 1997 ) , or the nitrogen content ( stasiska 2008 ) .",
    "the dependence on the ionization parameter has been studied , among other , by mcgaugh ( 1991 ) .",
    "some information on the ionization parameter can be obtained through the [ oii ] vs. [ oiii ] space and photoionization models . following the models by garnett ( 1999 ) ,",
    "the ionization parameters for all the regions studied here except two ( u05c1 and u96a2 ) agree with a value of @xmath73 , as well as an ionization temperature of @xmath74  -  @xmath75 k. moreover , we used the calibrations given by kobulnicky et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for the determination of the abundances with the r@xmath64 method .",
    "such calibrations were provided by mcgaugh based on his photoionization models , which take into account the ionization parameter through the @xmath76 parameter .",
    "it is also important to mention that the @xmath72 might be saturated near the solar abundance ( erb et al .",
    "2006 ) and , therefore , for larger values the @xmath72 method is not reliable .",
    "this is not a real problem here because only two regions show values of @xmath77 dex with this method , and they are similar to the other three measurements ( u05a1 ) or very much different ( u96a1 ) .",
    "all together , four different abundances are available for half of the sample of hii regions and , therefore , a reliable value can be inferred . for the other half of the sample",
    "only two values of the abundances can be obtained and therefore , the final abundance will be less accurate .",
    "the extinction - corrected intensities of the lines for each region are presented in tables 3 to 6 along with their uncertainties , the extinction coefficient and the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio in the [ oiii]@xmath395007 line .",
    "three of the galaxies in the sample , ugc 5242 , ugc 5296 and ugc 6377 , have spectral information in the sdss data - base",
    ". however , these sdss data are not of better quality than those presented here , with the [ oii]@xmath393727 , [ nii]@xmath396583 as well as the [ oiii]@xmath394363 lines are absent for all of the sdss spectra .",
    "using the same procedure described here an oxygen abundance can be obtained and they were compared with those obtained at the spm - oan telescope .",
    "the oxygen abundances were determined from the extinction - corrected intensities of the lines for each region .",
    "a different oxygen abundance is obtained with the different methods for each region . with all of these abundances ,",
    "a weighted - average abundance value is determined . in order to do so ,",
    "the results from hidalgo - gmez & ramrez - fuentes ( 2009 ) were considered , giving more weight to the metallicity determined with the @xmath65 method for low and high abundances zones if the ionization ratio ( [ oiii]/[oii ] ) is larger than @xmath6 but a similar weight for those values when this ratio is smaller than @xmath6 as well as in the so - called `` turn - around '' region .",
    "a dispersion from this weighted - average value is determined and tabulated in table 7 along with the averaged metallicity value .",
    "as previously said , a total of @xmath1 hii regions were observed in this galaxy in three different slit positions .",
    "they were orientated n - s , with a rotator angle of @xmath78 .",
    "slit position named @xmath79 was located at the canonical coordinates of the galaxy , therefore these regions are the most central ones .",
    "slit position named @xmath80 was moved towards the north about @xmath81 arcsecond and the slit named @xmath82 was moved towards the south about @xmath83 arcsecond from the central position , in both case without changing the rotator angle .",
    "the h@xmath48 line was not detected for one of the regions , therefore we can get abundance values for @xmath84 regions .",
    "the intensities and their uncertainties of all the lines detected are shown in table 3 .",
    "the [ nii]@xmath396583 line was detected in only four of these eleven regions : u05a1 , u05b2 , u05b4 and u05c3 .",
    "therefore , the abundances of these four regions can be determined with a total of four different methods . for them , the log ( [ nii]/[oii ] ) ratio as well as the @xmath70 and @xmath72 abundances will be used to determine the metallicity branch of the regions .",
    "these values are presented in table 7 .",
    "the log([nii]/[oii ] ) ratio has a very high value for u05a1 , and the @xmath70 and @xmath72 abundances are also very high .",
    "therefore , they are consistent each other . on the contrary , this ratio is slightly larger than @xmath85 for region u05c3 , but the @xmath70 and @xmath72 abundances are larger than @xmath0 dex and , therefore the high - metallicity branch values from the r@xmath64 and @xmath65 methods were preferred .",
    "for u05b2 the ratio is lower than @xmath85 , although with large uncertainties , while their @xmath70 and @xmath72 abundances lie between the low - metallicity and high - metallicity branch . actually , the low and high abundance values from the r@xmath64 and the @xmath65 methods for this region are very similar .",
    "the most troublesome region is u05b4 , because the abundances determined with the @xmath70 and the @xmath72 are larger than @xmath0 dex while the log ( n / o ) ratio is clearly lower than @xmath68 .",
    "an abnormal intensity of the nitrogen line could not be the explanation for such difference because the nitrogen intensity is very similar to the values obtained in other hii regions in this galaxy , as u05b2 . in any case",
    ", the high - metallicity values are very similar to those from the @xmath70 and @xmath72 in u05b4 and , therefore , they are preferred .",
    "the metallicities of the other seven regions where the nitrogen line at @xmath396583   is not detected are more difficult to determine .",
    "one of the reasons for the lack of detection of this line might be the low signal - to - noise ( s / n ) of their spectra . actually , all the regions without the [ nii]@xmath396583 line but one ( u05c1 ) have lower s / n than those regions where the nitrogen line is detected .",
    "therefore , it can not be concluded that all these regions have low - metallicity values . in any case , both values of the abundances ( low- and high - metallicity ) were determined for all the regions from both methods . from an inspection of these values , it is clear that the oxygen abundance of u05c2 is closer to the value inferred from the high - metallicity branch because the low - metallicity values are lower than @xmath86 dex . for the rest of the regions ,",
    "their galactocentric distances will be used to determine the metallicity branch . for it , it will be assumed that those regions located towards the center will have higher abundances than those located towards the edge . as regions u05a2 and u05a3 are located inside the central @xmath87 pc , it is expected that they will have high - metallicity abundances and those values will be considered here . on the contrary , u05b1 , u05b3 and u05b5",
    "are outside @xmath37 kpc and the low metallicity branch values will be preferred .",
    "finally , for u05c1 and u05c2 , which are located in the intermediate part of the galaxy , the high metallicity abundance values will be preferred .",
    "this situation described above is the most typical for spiral galaxies ( skillman et al .",
    "as only very few galaxies shows no differences in the oxygen abundance with the galactocentric distance ( e.g. ngc 1313 , walsh & roy 1997 ) we thought this will be the most likely scenario for ugc 6205 . in any case",
    ", there is a possibility that this galaxy shows a very shallow gradient , with all the abundances from the high - metallicity branch .",
    "then , the values of u05b1 , u05b3 and u05b5 will be of @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 dex , respectively .",
    "the main caveat is that these abundances are higher than the values for the intermediate distance regions , which will make the gradient to be negative for the innermost part of the galaxy and positive for the outermost regions . to our knowledge , this has not been observed in any spiral galaxy before . in any case ,",
    "a deeper discussion on this effect will be held in paper ii and here the low - metallicity values for these three regions are considered and stated in table 7 .    the regions with the largest abundances are u05c1 , u05a3 , u05a2 , and u05a1 .",
    "meanwhile u05a2 and u05a3 are located very close to the center of the galaxy , u05c1 , and u05a1 are at intermediate distances , between @xmath6 and @xmath91 kpc .",
    "therefore , their abundances might be anomalously high .",
    "the most interesting feature in the spectrum of u05a1 is the large value of the [ nii]/h@xmath12 ratio , of @xmath92 .",
    "this might be indicative of shocks but also some other phenomena , such as planetary nebulae ( pn ) .",
    "as the sulfur lines were not visible and the [ oii]@xmath393727 line could not be measured , the discrimination between the hii and the pn nature can not be done .",
    "concerning u05c1 , the high [ sii]/h@xmath12 ratio of the region , of @xmath93 it is very interesting and therefore , the existence of shocks inside this region should be considered . since the nitrogen line is absent in u05c1",
    ", it is not very likely the existence of a pn inside it .",
    "the shock waves could be due to the spiral structure , which can be clearly seen in the h@xmath12 images of this galaxy . actually , the [ sii]/h@xmath12 ratio for almost all the regions in this galaxy is very high , pointing out to shocks induced by the spiral structure .",
    "from the results showed in table 2 ugc 6205 is a typical spiral galaxy , with the central regions having solar abundances and those at the outskirts showing low metallicity when some of the regions of high metallicity are not considering as pure hii regions .",
    "a total of @xmath28 slit positions were observed for this dwarf spiral galaxy orientated e - w , with a rotator angle of @xmath94 . as no h@xmath12 image of was available for this galaxy",
    ", the coordinates were used to position the first slit , named @xmath80 .",
    "slit named @xmath79 was positioned towards the east about @xmath95 arcsecond and the slit named @xmath82 was moved towards the west about @xmath83 arcsecond from the center , without changing the rotator angle . in these three slit positions , a total of @xmath54 hii regions were detected . in one of them ,",
    "u77a2 , the forbidden auroral oxygen line at @xmath57   is clearly seen .",
    "therefore , the abundances can be determined using the so - called standard method ( e.g. allen 1984 ; osterbrock 1989 ) .",
    "the value of the electronic temperature of the high ionization zone , from the [ oiii ] intensity , as well as the oxygen and nitrogen abundances are shown in table 8 .",
    "also , the log(n / o ) and the electron temperature of the low - ionization region were determined and showed in this table .",
    "about the t@xmath96 determination , the reader is referred to hidalgo - gmez & ramirez - fuentes ( 2009 ) for a detailed discussion on it . despite the high electron temperature , @xmath97 k , similar to the values with the less metallicity galaxies known ( papaderos et al .",
    "2008 ) , the oxygen abundance is not very low , only of @xmath98 dex .",
    "this behaviour could be due to an abnormally high intensity of the [ oii ] line or could be real because there is not a linear correlation between the electron temperature and the oxygen abundances ( hidalgo - gmez , in preparation ) .",
    "when , and according to figure  [ fig1 ] , the lowest value of the intensity of the [ oii ] line is considered , an abundance of @xmath99 dex is obtained , which is lower than expected because this region is located inside @xmath6 kpc from the center .",
    "the nitrogen abundance is very low as well as the log(n / o ) ratio . in spite of these values",
    ", the abundances determined with any of the semi empirical methods are not so low but intermediate ( see table 7 ) , in agreement with the first value obtained of @xmath100 dex .",
    "finally , it is quite interesting that this region follows very well the relationship between nitrogen and oxygen abundances found for a sample of irregular galaxies ( see figure 3 in hidalgo - gmez & olofsson 2002 ) .    for the other eight regions , the abundances has to be determined with the semi empirical methods due to the lack of the auroral lines . the nitrogen line [ nii]@xmath396583 is detected in almost half of the regions , including u77a2 .",
    "the values of the log(n / o ) ratio , as stated in table 7 , indicate that two of them , u77a1 and u77b1 , might have high - metallicity values while the other two , u77a2 and u77c2 , have low - metallicity ones .",
    "this is confirmed by their @xmath70 and @xmath72 abundances for each region ( see table 7 ) .",
    "these results are quite odd in the sense that the hii regions with the highest abundances are located at the outskirts of the galaxy and this is not the expected situation for spiral galaxies , where the most external regions have lower metallicities than the internal , as previously said . as the standard method provides",
    "a low abundance for u77c2 and this region is quite close to the center of the galaxy , there are several possibilities to explain the high abundances of u77a1 and u77b1 .",
    "the most likely possibility is that there is an extra mechanism which increases the intensities of some of the lines and , therefore , the abundance appears artificially higher than it really is . from an inspection of their spectra ,",
    "it is remarkable than the oxygen line [ oi]@xmath396300   is clearly detected in the spectrum of u77a1 , with a [ oi]/h@xmath12 ratio of @xmath101 .",
    "although this value is high , it can be due only to photoionization ( stasiska 1990 ) . on the other hand , and according to the diagnostic diagrams ( see section 5 and figures  [ fig2 ] ,  [ fig3 ] and  [ fig4 ] ) this region is at the edge of the photoionized regions locus and therefore",
    ", shocks might be playing a role in the metallicity determination .",
    "moreover , the intensity of the nitrogen line at @xmath396583   is very high , of @xmath102 , compared to the average value for normal spiral galaxies , of about @xmath103 ( mccall et al .",
    "1985 ) . the oxygen line [ oi]@xmath396300   is not detected in u77b1 . in this case ,",
    "the [ sii]+[sii]/h@xmath12 is very high , larger than @xmath6 .",
    "moreover , the @xmath104/h\\alpha$ ] ratio is of @xmath105 .",
    "both values might indicate the existence of an extra ionization mechanism ( e.g. shocks , dopita & sutherland 1995 ) .",
    "one explanation for the large values of the nitrogen intensities and the suspicion of shocks is that these are really planetary nebulae ( pn ) instead of hii regions .",
    "another possibility is that these regions have low abundances despite of their @xmath70 and @xmath72 abundances .",
    "the low - metallicity abundances for u77a1 and u77b1 are @xmath106 and @xmath100 dex , respectively .",
    "these values agree very well with the abundance gradient determined in paper ii ( see figure 2 in paper ii ) .",
    "therefore , the low - metallicity abundances might be the most likely values . in the following , the abundances of these two regions will be taken with care until new observations were performed and confirm the pure hii region nature .    the [ nii]@xmath396583 line",
    "is not detected in the other five regions .",
    "as u77a2 is located at @xmath6 kpc from the center with a low oxygen abundance , the agreement was that all the regions beyond this distance will be of low metallicity as well .",
    "only one region is located inside @xmath6 kpc , u77b2 , and it will be considered as of high metallicity , with a value of @xmath107 dex . in any case , the abundances are similar or slightly lower than the values for the lmc ( e.g. russell & dopita 1990 ) .",
    "as previously said , an spectrum of ugc 6377 can be retrieved from the sdss data - base .",
    "the quality of this spectrum is lower than those presented here , with the lack of the [ oiii]@xmath394363 and [ nii]@xmath396583 lines as well as [ oii]@xmath393727 .",
    "the abundances , determined with the r@xmath64 and @xmath65 methods are of @xmath108 dex or @xmath109 dex , for the low- and high - metallicity branch , respectively .",
    "as this galaxy is not that far away ( only 27.3 mpc ) that the subtended angle were smaller than the sdss fiber - size ( of about 3  ) , this is not an integrated spectra , but more likely might correspond to the central part of the galaxy , because it is the region with the largest surface brightness . therefore",
    ", the location might be similar to the one corresponding to u77b2 and the high metallicity branch value is preferred .",
    "the number of the hii regions in this galaxy is quite few .",
    "a total of only five regions were detected in the h@xmath12 image ( reyes - prez & hidalgo - gmez 2008 ) .",
    "one of them is located to the far east of the galaxy and no spectrum was obtained for it , while the other four regions were aligned north - south and those are the spectra presented in this investigation .",
    "their spectra were obtained with only one slit position , due to their alignment , being the northeaster one , at @xmath110 arcsec from the center , named @xmath79 and the southend one , @xmath111 , at @xmath112 arcsec .",
    "the intensities of the lines were measured with both softwares , alice - midas and vista .",
    "the values obtained are presented at table 5 . for h@xmath48 only one row",
    "is presented because the normalised intensity of this line is always @xmath6 .",
    "the vista software detected the [ nii]@xmath396583   line in all the regions , while only in two are clearly presented according to the visual inspection : u96a2 and u96a3 , which are the regions with the highest s / n . as vista works as an automatic procedure for the line detections , it might be possible that the nitrogen line in the other two regions are not real , but only upper limits .",
    "actually , the intensity of this line in u96a1 is the highest in the sample , but no line was detected in a visual inspection .",
    "another issue to be noticed from the line intensities presented in table 5 is that the line intensities measured by vista and by alice are very similar except for region u96a1 .",
    "a reason for such difference is that this is the region with the lowest s / n in the sample and therefore , they were very difficult to measure with any of the softwares .",
    "the values of the log([nii]/[oii ] ) ratio are listed in table 7 .",
    "both regions u96a2 and u96a3 are clearly of high - metallicity because the values of this ratio with both , vista and alice , set of intensities are higher than @xmath85 .",
    "moreover , the @xmath70 and @xmath72 abundances are larger than @xmath0 for both regions and both set of intensities .",
    "therefore , they both will be considered as of high - metallicity .",
    "it is very interesting to see that the oxygen line at @xmath113   is detected in both regions .",
    "moreover , the [ oi]/h@xmath12 ratio and the [ sii]/h@xmath12 are very large , especially for u96a2 , with values of @xmath114 dex and @xmath115 dex , respectively . on the contrary ,",
    "the [ nii]/h@xmath12 is normal to the values obtained in other sm galaxies , for both regions .",
    "this could be an indication of the existence of shocks inside this region , and an explanation for its large @xmath67 and @xmath65 abundances .    the vista value for the log([nii]/[oii ] )",
    "ratio in u96a4 is lower than @xmath85 , indicating probably a low metallicity value .",
    "the @xmath70 and @xmath72 vista abundances are of @xmath116 , just on the limit between the high and low metallicity regions .",
    "the s / n ratio of this region is similar to u96a2 , where [ nii]@xmath396583   is clearly visible .",
    "moreover , h@xmath117 is detected in u96a4 .",
    "therefore , the lack of the nitrogen line is not due to the low s / n but to a real absence due to low metallicity .",
    "moreover , this region is located at about @xmath41 kpc from the center and then , the low - metallicity values of the r@xmath64 and @xmath65 abundances are preferred .",
    "the most troublesome region is u96a1 .",
    "the vista value of the log([nii]/[oii ] ) ratio is very high , but the @xmath70 and @xmath72 abundances are of @xmath77 , probably because of the saturation of the @xmath72 method at solar abundances ( erb et al .",
    "2006 ) . as previously said ,",
    "the vista values of the line intensities are very different from those measured with alice .",
    "moreover , the former intensities are very odd ; its intensity of the [ oiii]@xmath395007 line is the lowest for all the regions in the sample but the [ nii]@xmath396583 is very high .",
    "correction for dispersion might be important in the determination of such odd metallicity .",
    "the main caveat is that all the hii regions of this galaxies were detected in only one single slit - position ( or angle ) , then if dispersion correction ( or the lack of it ) is the problem , it might affect to all the values of the other three hii regions as well . in particular , to the values of u96a4 because it is also very far from the center of the galaxy ( and the center of the slit ) . as the other regions do not present any peculiar intensities , we think that the lack of dispersion correction can be ruled out as the origin of the odd intensities ( and oxygen abundances ) of u96a1",
    ". then , the galactocentric distance will be useful for deciding the metallicity branch . actually , this is the most outside region , at almost @xmath28 kpc from the center . with such galactocentric distance ,",
    "values of the abundances as high as @xmath118 dex are not very likely .",
    "therefore , the low - metallicity values are preferred .",
    "although the metallicity determine with the low - metallicity branch , of @xmath99 dex for the average metallicity , is lower than the abundance for the hii region sdh323 in m101 ( kennicutt et al .",
    "2003 ) , this value is similar to those of low metallicity irregular galaxies as gr8 , ddo 168 and ddo 167 ( hidalgo - gmez & olofsson 2002 ) .    due to its quite remarkable low metallicity of this hii region , we would like to explore other possibilities .",
    "the first one is take into account the values obtained from the vista software .",
    "the averaged oxygen abundance is @xmath119 dex , which is a normal value compared to the metallicities of other hii regions in sm galaxies ( mccall et al .",
    "another possibility is being u96a1 a distant galaxy in itself .",
    "along with the low metallicity is the fact that it is very far from the center , at @xmath120 pc .",
    "moreover , it is easily detected in h@xmath12 but not in v or r. in spite of this , the receding velocity obtained from the spectrum is very similar among all the hii regions , including u96a1 .",
    "therefore , it will be considered as part of the galaxy .",
    "there is also an spectrum of this galaxy in the sloan data - base , although the metallicity can not be determined because no intensity for h@xmath48 line is reported .",
    "moreover , the uncertainties in the h@xmath12 intensity are about @xmath121 .",
    "as can be seen , the metallicity of ugc 5296 follows the typical behaviour of normal spirals with a high - metallicity core , in this case the values are about solar , and low abundances at the edges .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the agreement in the metallicity values obtained from the vista set of intensities and the alice - midas one is very good except for u96a1 .",
    "a total of @xmath33 hii regions were observed in this barred galaxy in five slit - positions orientated e - w ( rotator angle @xmath94 ) , parallel each other . in two of them ,",
    "located at the far east of the galaxy ( at more than @xmath122 arcsec from the center ) , only the h@xmath12 line was detected .",
    "the slit position named @xmath111 is located about the center of the galaxy , while @xmath123 arcsec towards the east is slit position named @xmath82 and @xmath124 arcsec towards the west is slit position named @xmath125 . from these three positions , there are oxygen abundances determined for five regions . again , the intensities of the lines were determined with two softwares , alice - midas and vista .",
    "it is interesting to notice important differences in the line intensities between them .",
    "the main one is the lack of detections for region u42d1 with vista , while a normal , complete set of line were detected with alice - midas .",
    "no explanation could be found for such situation , therefore only a set of line intensities was considered for this region .",
    "in addition to this , and as in ugc 5296 , vista detected the [ nii]@xmath396583 line in all the other four regions , while only in three out of five regions this line was detected using alice - midas .",
    "two of these regions , u42c2 and u42e2 , have low s / n ratio and the vista [ nii]@xmath396583 intensities are very low .",
    "therefore , it will be considered as noise detection and the average abundance from the vista values in table 7 were obtained without them . finally , there are differences in almost of the line intensities between the two set for u42c1 , which is the region with the largest s / n ratio . in spite of this ,",
    "the abundaces from the two set of intensities are very similar for this region except for those obtained with the @xmath70 method .    as for the previous galaxies , the log(n[ii]/[oii ] )",
    "ratio and the @xmath70 and @xmath72 abundances were used to determine the metallicity branch .",
    "the values of the log(n[ii]/[oii ] ) ratio are stated in table 7 for both set of intensities .",
    "it is remarkable than the vista values are much lower than the alice - midas ones except for u42e1 . actually , three of the values of the log(n / o ) are very low , lower than @xmath126 .",
    "the log([nii]/[oii ] ) values indicate low metallicity for all the hii regions . using the low - metallicity values , they range between @xmath127 and @xmath128 dex , except two @xmath70 vista values . moreover , the agreement among the abundance values obtained with vista software and alice - midas ones are very good for all the regions in ugc 5242 .",
    "there are two spectra of this galaxy in the sdss data - base but only one of them is retrievable .",
    "as this galaxy is at @xmath129 mpc , the intensity of the [ oii]@xmath393727 line is not available , and therefore , equation 2 is used .",
    "the value of the log(n / o ) is @xmath130 dex and the abundances determined with the @xmath70 and @xmath72 are lower than @xmath131 dex . then , the low - metallicity branch values are preferred and an averaged abundances of @xmath119 dex are obteined with them .",
    "this value is very close to the one for u52d1 .",
    "as for ugc 6377 , the spectra will correspond likely to the central part of the galaxy .",
    "this galaxy does not follow the canonical situation for spiral galaxies .",
    "there is no real enhancement of the metallicity at the central part of the galaxy ( as said , slit named @xmath111 is very close to the center of the galaxy ) . instead , the abundances are very similar wherever their galactocentric distance .",
    "it resembles irregular galaxies , where the differences in the oxygen abundances among the hii regions do not follow any pattern , if they exist ( hidalgo - gmez et a. 2001b ) .",
    "another situation might be a very shallow gradient , as typical of barred galaxies ( martin & roy 1994 ) .",
    "one crucial question about the data presented here is how accurate these values are .",
    "this is important because they have been determined with semi empirical methods , which as discussed in section 3 , have several and important caveats and dependences .",
    "nevertheless , the used of semi empirical method in the abundance determination in spiral galaxies is very common ( e.g. skillman et al .",
    "moreover , the [ oii ] intensities are determined from a statistical approach .",
    "therefore , it is important to check the consistency of the results .    concerning the abundance values presented here",
    ", the first thing that can be notice from table 7 , is that the z@xmath64 abundances are always higher than the abundances from the other methods for more than half of the sample .",
    "the difference between the metallicity determined with the r@xmath64 and any other method could be up to @xmath5 dex .",
    "this is probably related with the excitation parameter @xmath65 , as stated by pilyugin ( 2003 ) . if those values with differences larger than @xmath132 are not considered in the determination of the average metallicity , the values are still not very much different from those reported in column 7 of table 7 .",
    "similar results are obtained if only the regions with the highest s / n are considered .",
    "moreover , the dispersion values of the abundances for all the regions except eight ( including the vista abundances ) are @xmath101 or smaller .",
    "such small value of the dispersion indicates a large consistency between the different abundance estimations .",
    "some of the regions with the larger dispersion are located in ugc 5296 and ugc 5242 , for which the vista abundances have larger dispersion than the alice - midas ones . in some case",
    ", the discrepancy is between pairs of values : those estimates with the r@xmath64 and @xmath65 methods are consistent among them as well as those determined with @xmath70 and @xmath72 , but they differ each other ( see table 7 ) . for some regions of ugc 5242 , the @xmath70 abundances are very small compared with the other values",
    ". this could be a problem of the [ nii ] intensity determination or to the particular @xmath70 calibration instead of a real dispersion because the @xmath72 abundances are very similar to the r@xmath64 and @xmath65 values .",
    "since each method has a different caveat , such similarities in the oxygen abundance indicate the robustness of the value .",
    "therefore , even if each of the metallicity values are not very accurate , the average one is probably a very good approximation of the real metallicity of the region . of course , with all the caution that the use of semi empirical methods involved . in this sense",
    ", the reader has to take into account that the uncertainties in the abundances are only due to the uncertainties in the line intensities and that the canonical uncertainties of each method due to the empirical calibrations have not been considered , mainly because they are of the same amount for all the abundance values .",
    "the second issue to discussed , already addressed in the previous section , is the fact that there are some hii region with odd abundances , in the sense that they are located at the outskirts of the galaxies but their oxygen abundances are quite high . in most of these regions",
    "there are interesting features in their spectra , such as the detection of the [ oi ] line or very high values of the [ nii]/h@xmath12 or [ sii]/h@xmath12 ratios , which might indicate the existence of shocks or a different nature than a pure hii region .",
    "we are going to explore these regions with the aid of the diagnostic diagrams .",
    "the diagnostic diagrams presented by baldwin et al . ( 1981 ) are based on the [ oii]/[oiii ] ratio . as we have used the intensity of the [ oiii ] line to determine the intensity of the [ oii ] line , this ratio must be somehow contaminated and we preferred not to used any of these diagrams . instead , the diagrams presented by veilleux & osterbrock ( 1987 ) are very interesting .    in figures  [ fig2 ] ,  [ fig3 ] and  [ fig4 ] we plot the log([oiii])/h@xmath48 vs. log([nii])/h@xmath12 , log([sii])/h@xmath12 , and log([oi])/h@xmath12 , respectively . along with the data from the galaxies studied in this investigation , we included data from a sample of i m galaxies ( hidalgo - gmez et al .",
    "2001 ; hidalgo - gmez et al .",
    "2001b ; hidalgo - gmez & olofsson 2002 ; hidalgo - gmez 2006 ; hidalgo - gmez 2007 ; hidalgo - gmez & georgiev , in preparation ) , from the sample of ds published in hg04 and the sm galaxies from mccall et al .",
    "( 1985 ) , named sp in hidalgo - gmez & olofsson ( 2002 ) . although this is an old investigation , about @xmath133 years old , their main results have not been superseded by new results and they still hold .",
    "the hii region locus is very well defined by the sm galaxies from mccall et al .",
    "sample for both figures  [ fig2 ] and  [ fig3 ] .",
    "all but two of the data - points of the ds galaxies studied here are located to the right of the locus defined by the normal sm sample in the log([oiii])/h@xmath48 vs. log([nii])/h@xmath12 diagram , as much of the ds from the literature and the i m sample .",
    "actually , the three samples can not be distinguished from each other in this diagram , and there is a gap between them and those sm from mccall et al .",
    "( 1985 ) . at the same excitation ,",
    "sm galaxies have larger values of the [ nii])/h@xmath12 ratio .",
    "following the models from evans & dopita ( 1985 ) showed by veilleux & osterbrock ( 1989 ) , and using the excitation values , the ionization temperature of the star cluster can be inferred , with values between @xmath134 and @xmath135 k for all the hii regions of the ds samples , which are larger than those determined in normal sm galaxies .",
    "this might indicate that sm and ds are not self - similar , but have important and interesting differences in their evolutionary processes , as concluded by hg04 .",
    "the log([oiii])/h@xmath48 vs. log([nii])/h@xmath12 diagram is quite interesting in itself because it has also been used recently as a metallicity discriminator ( asari et al .",
    "2007 ) , increasing the abundances towards the left - bottom part of the diagram . in figure  [ fig2 ]",
    "we see that the majority of the hii regions studied in this investigation have oxygen abundances quite similar to the i m galaxies , lower than @xmath136 dex .",
    "this result is in agreement with those obtained in the previous section .    concerning the log([oiii])/h@xmath48 vs. log([sii])/h@xmath12 diagram ( figure [ fig3 ] )",
    ", all the data - points from the ds studied here are located towards the right - upper part of diagram , indicating a larger value of the [ sii]/h@xmath12 ratio than the rest of the galaxies for the same excitation value .",
    "most of them are ugc 6205 regions .",
    "as previously discussed , the [ sii]/h@xmath12 ratio in this galaxy is very high , maybe due to shock waves induced by the spiral pattern .",
    "it is important to say that ugc 6205 is the galaxy with the best defined spiral pattern of the sample studied here .",
    "it is also interesting to notice that the data from the ds galaxies are located in a small part of the diagram , contrary to the normal sm galaxies which fill all the hii regions locus .",
    "the former are also , in general , separated from the i m galaxies",
    ". it might be also interesting to consider the locations of the hii regions of our sample in dopita & sutherland s diagrams ( 1995 ) .",
    "eleven of the hii regions are located inside the shocked region of the log([oiii]/h@xmath48 ) vs log([sii]/h@xmath12 ) diagram ( their figure 2a ) .",
    "this is in agreement with figure  [ fig3 ] here , where at least @xmath83 regions in our sample are located to the left of the hii regions locus .",
    "when only the high s / n regions are considered , there are no real differences in this diagram .",
    "they lie in the same part of the diagram as the low s / n regions , and only few of the latter are located separately , at log([oiii])/h@xmath48 @xmath32 @xmath137 and log([sii])/h@xmath12 between @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "the log([oiii])/h@xmath48 vs. log([nii])/h@xmath12 diagram from dopita & sutherland ( 1995 ) is not very useful here because it is based on very metallic objects and all the regions in our sample but two lay outside the range .",
    "these two regions are u05a1 and u77b1 , both having a large oxygen abundance .",
    "finally , it can be considered the log([oiii])/h@xmath48 vs. log([oi])/h@xmath12 diagram .",
    "there is no information on the [ oi]@xmath396300 line intensity for sm galaxies ( see mccall et al .",
    "1985 ) and therefore , the hii region locus is not very well defined .",
    "actually , there are only nine regions in this diagram , five i m and four ds , which is a very small sample for any conclusion .",
    "however , it can be seen that there is a single region ( u96a2 ) which is located very likely inside the shocked region , while other two ( u96a3 and u77a1 ) are at the border of it .",
    "the only conclusion that could be obtained from figure  [ fig4 ] is that there is a quite separation between ds and i m , having the former larger values of the [ oi]/h@xmath12 ratio .      as an interesting aside",
    ", we will discuss the log(n / o ) vs. 12+log(o / h ) diagram .",
    "this is considered as an evolutionary diagram in the sense that oxygen is released into the ism at an earlier phase than nitrogen , and therefore this ratio is smaller for recent events of star - formation while as the region aged , the log(n / o ) becomes larger ( pilyugin 1992 ) . even without the [ oiii]@xmath394363 line , the log(n / o ) ratio can be obtained ( lee et al .",
    "an electronic temperature of the high - ionization zone ( t@xmath140 ) is determined from the relation between this parameter and the oxygen abundances ( e.g. figure 7 at mcgaugh 1991 ) . with this value ,",
    "equations in table 1 at vila - costas & edmunds ( 1993 ) can be used in order to obtain an electronic temperature of the low - ionization zone ( t@xmath141 ) .",
    "finally , the ratio is determined using equation 9 in pagel et .",
    "al ( 1992 ) .",
    "it has to be said that no correction has been applied to the log ( n@xmath142/o@xmath142 ) ratio .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the log(n / o ) determined with the standard method for u77a2 , as stated in table 8 , is much lower than the value determined as previously explained , @xmath143 dex compared to @xmath144 dex .",
    "several explanations could be for it : the large value of the t@xmath145 obtained , the low intensity of the [ oii]@xmath393727   line or the low intensity of the [ nii]@xmath396583   line .",
    "actually , the nitrogen abundance from table 8 is also very low , which might indicates that the last possibility is the most likely .    from the data presented in this investigation , a value of this ratio is determined for @xmath83 regions .",
    "we did not consider the values obtained with the vista software because all the log(n / o ) are very odd , with values very low or very high .",
    "this diagram is shown in figure  [ fig5 ] for all the regions studied here ( squares ) along with a sample of blue compact galaxies ( stars ) , low - surface brightness ( pluses ) , dwarf irregular ( diamonds ) and normal spirals ( triangles ) from hidalgo - gmez & olofsson ( 2002 ) and references therein .",
    "it is claimed that nitrogen is a secondary element in spiral galaxies ( e.g. daz et al .",
    "1991 ) , being related with the oxygen abundance , while it is primary in irregular , showing a flat relation with the oxygen content .",
    "this is not very much the situation in this diagram ( see figure  [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "as expected , both lsbg and bcg show a flat relation , considering the large uncertainties associated with this ratio , without galaxies with metallicities larger than @xmath136 dex and @xmath0 dex and @xmath146 dex the lowest value of the log(n / o ) .",
    "contrary to their expected behaviour , normal - size late - type spirals ( sm ) have a very large dispersion , mostly a scatter diagram , with data - points in the low - metallicity and high log(n / o)region ( at the left of the figure ) and only two of the galaxies have metallicities larger than @xmath0 dex . dwarf spiral galaxies follow the trend in this diagram if nitrogen is a secondary element for abundances larger than @xmath131 dex , while for lower abundances the log(n / o ) seems to follow a flat relation at a lower value than those for bgc and lsbg .",
    "it is also interesting the rising of the trend at very low metallicity .",
    "only one out of @xmath95 regions with metallicities lower than @xmath100 dex has a value of log(n / o ) lower than @xmath146 while @xmath95 out of @xmath147 regions have this value for metallicities between @xmath100 and @xmath0 dex .",
    "most of those regions are not in bcg , therefore this result is not in contradiction with those obtained by izotov et al .",
    "( * ? ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where bcg at low metallicity has a very constant value of the log(n / o ) .",
    "in any case , the dispersion for any type of galaxies at low metallicity is very large , at least @xmath148 dex and a large sample of late - type galaxies is needed to confirm such rising .",
    "then , it can be concluded that the secondary origin for nitrogen is related to the oxygen abundances only and not to the morphological type because there are hii regions in spiral galaxies with log(n / o ) lower than @xmath149 .",
    "then , it can not be said that nitrogen in spiral galaxies is always secondary , but only in those hii regions of high abundance .",
    "no one of the hii regions studied here have a real high value of the oxygen abundance , as in other spiral galaxies ( e.g. up to @xmath150 dex for galaxies in the virgo cluster in skillman et al .",
    "therefore , it is important to see if the abundances values obtained here are typical of small , late - type spiral galaxies or , on the contrary , they are very different to the previous values determined .    as said in the introduction , there are already 17 ds galaxies with abundance determinations , although most of them were not classified as ds by the authors . in table 4 of hg04 the oxygen abundance of nine of these galaxies",
    "were presented .",
    "the other eight galaxies have been studied recently .",
    "they are presented in table 9 . for most of the galaxies , the abundances",
    "were not determined with the standard method , but with any of the semi empirical methods , as in the present study . only for two galaxies ( ngc 2552 and ugca 294 ) more than one of those methods were used in the determination of the oxygen abundances .",
    "and other three galaxies ( ngc 5666 , ugc 7861 and ngc 625 ) have abundances values for several hii regions .    in hg04",
    "it is concluded , based on nine ds galaxies , that them and i m have very similar oxygen abundance values although normal spiral have higher abundances ( dutil 1998 ) .",
    "this result is confirmed with the new abundances published , where the largest value is slightly sub solar , @xmath151 dex in ngc 3510 ( kewley et al . 2005 ) and the lowest one is @xmath152 dex in ngc 625 ( saviane et al .",
    "the metallicity range encompassed by them is very similar to the one of the present study as well as to the metallicity values of i m .",
    "only three of the hii regions studied here have a large value of the oxygen abundance , all of them in ugc 6205 , and only u96a1 have a lower metallicity .",
    "two hii regions in ddo 204 have very low metallicities , of @xmath153 dex and @xmath154 dex , mainly because of the very low value of the [ oii]@xmath393727    intensities ( hg04 ) .",
    "when equation 1 is used to calculated a new intensity for this line , values of @xmath155 dex and @xmath156 are obtained , which are similar to the rest of the abundances in ds galaxies . in conclusion",
    ", it can be said that ds galaxies have lower abundances than other type of spiral galaxies , in agreement with the observed trend ( zaritsky et al .",
    "also , the abundances presented here are in fully agreement with those previously reported .",
    "the oxygen abundances have been determined for a small sample of dwarf spiral galaxies .",
    "the auroral lines were detected in only one out of 29 hii regions studied .",
    "therefore , the semi empirical methods were used for the abundances determinations in the rest of the regions . for those hii regions where",
    "the nitrogen line was detected a total of four methods were used .",
    "for those regions where the nitrogen line were absent the abundances were determined using only two methods .",
    "for all the regions studied , a weighted average abundance is determined based on all the determinations .",
    "the majority of the regions have a sub solar abundances , with values between @xmath77 and @xmath100 dex , in agreement with the values obtained to the other types of late galaxies . only the central part of ugc 6205 have more metallic regions and it is the most metallic galaxy in the sample .",
    "the other three galaxies are of low metallicity , with under solar abundances in all their hii regions , even the most internal ones .",
    "actually , the most external region of ugc 5296 seems to have a very low abundance , of only @xmath99 dex , which might be one of the lowest abundance value measured in a spiral galaxy so far .",
    "three of the regions studied here have , probably , a pn embedded because the high [ nii]/h@xmath12 ratio while another one might have shocks induced by the spiral arms .",
    "this is suggested by the diagnostic diagram and the shock models by dopita & sutherland ( 1995 ) .",
    "moreover , the galaxies in the sample studied here are located in all the diagnostic diagram closer to the irregular galaxies than to the canonical sm galaxies , indicating that there might be two different types of sm galaxies : the dwarf sm galaxies and the normal - size ones as indicated by other investigations ( e.g. reyes - prez & hidalgo - gmez 2008 ) .    concerning the log(n / o ) ratio ,",
    "not all the hii regions in spiral galaxies show a secondary behaviour , but only those with metallicity larger than @xmath0 dex.the rest of the regions show a flat relation with the oxygen abundance",
