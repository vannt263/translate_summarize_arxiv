    "the invention of stochastic cooling by van der meer made it possible to accumulate antiprotons in a high - quality beam  @xcite . as a result , the antinucleon - nucleon ( @xmath4 ) interaction could be studied at the low energy antiproton ring ( lear ) at cern .",
    "experimental data of good quality could be obtained down to antiproton momenta of about 200 mev/@xmath2 .",
    "the observables measured were mostly differential cross sections for antiproton - proton elastic ( @xmath0 ) and charge - exchange ( @xmath1 ) scattering . with a polarized proton target the analyzing power for elastic  @xcite and charge - exchange  @xcite scattering was measured for a number of antiproton momenta , and initial data for the depolarization parameter in elastic  @xcite and charge - exchange  @xcite scattering and for the spin - transfer parameter in charge - exchange  @xcite scattering",
    "were acquired .",
    "it has always been a dream of the antiproton physics community to have available a high - quality polarized antiproton beam . in recent years ,",
    "definite plans have been proposed for a physics program with polarized antiprotons , for instance by the collaboration for polarized antiproton experiments ( pax ) @xcite .",
    "experiments with a polarized antiproton beam and a polarized proton target would give full access to the complicated spin dependence of the @xmath4 interaction and could help to unveil the spin structure of the ( anti)proton and test predictions of nonperturbative qcd .",
    "in this article , we present theoretical predictions for spin observables in @xmath3 elastic and charge - exchange scattering . our results are based on the recent new energy - dependent partial - wave analysis ( pwa )  @xcite that we performed of all @xmath3 scattering data below 925 mev/@xmath2 .",
    "the method of pwa was originally developed for @xmath5 and @xmath6 scattering  @xcite and enabled major steps forward for the field of few - nucleon physics  @xcite .",
    "it was adapted to @xmath0 , @xmath7 scattering in refs .",
    "@xcite , and to the hyperon production reactions @xmath8 in refs .",
    "this pwa exploits as much as possible our knowledge of the long - range interaction to describe the energy dependence of the ( spin - dependent ) scattering amplitude , while the unknown short - range interaction that gives only slow energy variations to the amplitudes is parametrized phenomenologically . in this way , a model - independent and high - quality description of the scattering data is realized , and the predictive power for thus - far unmeasured observables is optimal  @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the long - range part of the strong @xmath3 interaction is described by the one - pion and two - pion exchange interactions derived from the effective chiral lagrangian of qcd .",
    "notable features are a strong central attraction in the elastic @xmath0 channel and a strong tensor force , in particular for charge - exchange @xmath1 scattering . the short - range part of the interaction , including the coupling of the @xmath3 , @xmath7 system to the mesonic annihilation channels , is parametrized by a complex , energy - dependent boundary condition at @xmath9 fm .",
    "the pwa describes the existing @xmath3 database , which contains 3749 scattering data with an excellent @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "the organization of our paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : spin ] we explore the various polarization observables in elastic and charge - exchange scattering and the predictions of the pwa .",
    "we exhibit some sizable spin effects that could , for instance , be exploited experimentally to produce polarized antineutrons .",
    "our study is similar in spirit to that of ref .",
    "@xcite , in which spin observables were discussed qualitatively before lear came into operation by using a simple optical - potential model . in sec .",
    "[ sec : pol ] , we discuss how to exploit the spin dependence of the @xmath3 interaction to polarize a low - energy antiproton beam .",
    "we summarize in sec .  [",
    "sec : summary ] .",
    "the scattering formalism that we use is standard ( see for instance refs .  @xcite ) .",
    "because the strong and electromagnetic interactions obey the discrete symmetries charge - conjugation , parity , and time - reversal invariance , the @xmath4 scattering observables can be calculated as a function of the scattering angle in the center - of - mass system in terms of five ( for the elastic case ) or six ( for the charge - exchange case ) independent scattering amplitudes @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 denote the total initial and final spin , respectively , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the corresponding @xmath17 components .",
    "neither for @xmath4 nor for the better known @xmath18 case are enough independent experimental quantities available to determine for a fixed energy these five ( or six ) amplitudes for every angle @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "therefore , so - called amplitude analyses are not feasible and energy - dependent partial - wave analyses are the tool of choice  @xcite .",
    "we denote a general scattering observable by @xmath20 , where the indices denote the spin direction of the particles : @xmath21 scattered , @xmath22 recoil , @xmath23 beam , and @xmath24 target .",
    "it is convenient to use two different coordinate systems for the spin directions : ( i ) the vectors @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 define a right - handed coordinate system wherein @xmath27 is the direction of the incoming beam and @xmath26 is normal to the scattering plane ; ( ii ) the spin directions @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 are tied to the outgoing particles , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 lie in the scattering plane and @xmath33 , and @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the initial and final momenta in the center - of - mass system .",
    "the scattering observables can be expressed in terms of the scattering amplitude as @xmath36 \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath37/4 $ ] is the differential cross section averaged over the spins of the initial - state particles and summed over the spins of the final - state particles ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "the indices take the values @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath17 or @xmath39 , @xmath42 , @xmath15 , and @xmath43 ; @xmath44 are the pauli spin matrices , and @xmath45 is the identity matrix used in case of an unpolarized particle or unobserved spin direction .",
    "the simplest spin observable is the analyzing power @xmath46 , defined by @xmath47\\ ] ] ( where we replaced @xmath48 by the conventional symbol @xmath49 ) , the measurement of which requires only a polarized proton target .",
    "differential cross sections and analyzing powers of good quality were measured at lear for both elastic and charge - exchange scattering .    in order to measure all possible spin",
    "observables one needs a polarized proton target , a polarized antiproton beam , and `` analyzers '' of the polarization of the recoil proton ( or neutron ) and the scattered antiproton ( or antineutron ) .",
    "while there are standard techniques to polarize a proton target , a high - intensity polarized antiproton beam does not exist yet .",
    "the polarization of the recoil proton can be measured by secondary scattering on a carbon target . however , carbon is not a good analyzer for the polarization of antiprotons  @xcite and a proton target gives only about 10% analyzing power for antiprotons . for these reasons , next to the analyzing power @xmath50 , the depolarization @xmath51 is the easiest spin observable to measure .",
    "it was measured , with limited statistical precision , at lear for both elastic and charge - exchange scattering for a few antiproton momenta . for charge - exchange scattering also the spin transfer @xmath52 was measured . @xmath53 and @xmath54 are examples of depolarization and spin - transfer observables , defined in general by    @xmath55 \\ , \\\\",

    ", one can define higher - rank spin observables . in this paper",
    ", however , we focus on the above observables , since even these rank - two spin observables are difficult to measure . we point out that sometimes other notations are used in the literature , for instance @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 , etc .",
    "actually , it is often convenient to mix the notations @xmath42 , @xmath15 , @xmath43 and @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath17 .",
    "for instance , we can define @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 , where the bar means that the spin of the particle points in the opposite direction of the index .    in order to calculate the spin observables , we use as input the scattering amplitudes as predicted by our pwa . as discussed in detail in refs .",

    "in this section we investigate the buildup of polarization of a circulating antiproton beam by a polarized proton target .",
    "the basic idea is that , since the antiproton - proton total cross section is spin dependent , the number of antiprotons that remain in the beam depends on the spin state of the antiprotons relative to that of the protons .",
    "the antiprotons remain in the beam when they are elastically scattered within a certain , very small scattering angle , called the `` acceptance angle . ''",
    "these antiprotons can be scattered again in the next revolution of the beam .",
    "the antiprotons that interact elastically with larger scattering angle , or undergo charge exchange , or get annihilated are removed from the beam . when the beam is circulated many times in a ring with the target ,",
    "the remaining beam loses intensity but acquires a net polarization .",
    "this mechanism is sometimes called `` spin filtering . ''",
    "the feasibility of polarizing a proton beam in this way was demonstrated at the test storage ring in heidelberg by the experiment filtex @xcite .",

    "we assume that the polarization buildup due to the filtering mechanism dominates and that spin - flip mechanisms in the beam can be neglected  @xcite .",

    "the same holds for the nuclear amplitude , eq .",
