    "the main feature of a lvy - type density distribution @xmath3 is the slow , power - law , decay of its tail .",
    "more precisely , for large @xmath5 , @xmath6 with @xmath7 .",
    "note that the second moment of @xmath3 diverges for all @xmath8 and if @xmath9 also the first moment diverges .",
    "this kind of distributions are also known as @xmath8-stable distributions @xcite .",
    "random processes characterized by probability densities with a long tail ( lvy - type processes ) have been found and studied in very different phenomena and fields such as biology , economy , and physics . among many of recently studied systems showing lvy - type processes we can mention : animal foraging @xcite , human mobility @xcite , earthquake statistics @xcite , mosquitoes flight under epidemiological modeling @xcite , and light transmission through a disordered glass @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite for a compilation of systems displaying lvy flights .    in particular",
    ", to help us to introduce later the main model system of this study , i.e. the _ lvy map _ , we want to describe in some detail a simple dynamical model characterized by lvy processes : the _ ripple billiard_.    the ripple billiard , see for example chapter 6 of @xcite , consists of two walls : one flat at @xmath10 and a rippled one given by the function @xmath11 ; here @xmath12 is the average width of the billiard and @xmath13 the ripple amplitude , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . an attractive feature of the ripple billiard is that its classical phase space undergoes the generic transition to global chaos as the amplitude of the cosine function increases .",
    "then , results from the analysis of this system are applicable to a large class of systems , namely non - degenerate , non - integrable hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "moreover , the dynamics of classical particles inside the ripple billiard can be well approximated by a two - dimensional ( 2d ) poincar map @xmath14 between successive collisions with the rippled boundary @xcite @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the angle the particle s trajectory makes with the @xmath17-axis just before the @xmath18th bounce with the rippled boundary at @xmath19 .",
    "map @xmath14 can be easily derived and , after the assumptions @xmath20 and @xmath21 , it gets the simple form @xmath22 as an example , in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) we plot the poincar map @xmath14 for @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "it is clear from this plot that this combination of geometrical parameters produces ergodic dynamics ( also known as global chaos ) .",
    "notice that in this figure we have plotted the variable @xmath17 modulus @xmath25 , as usual for this kind of 2d maps ; with this , we can globally visualize the map dynamics in a single plot but we may loose important information .",
    ", see eq .",
    "( [ m]).,width=264 ]        among the dynamical information which is lost when applying @xmath26 to a map such as @xmath14 , we can mention the length of paths between successive map iterations @xmath27 ,",
    "i.e. the length between two successive collisions with the rippled boundary of the billiard .",
    "in fact , in fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) we present @xmath3 for the same parameters used to construct fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) . from this figure",
    "we can clearly see that : ( i ) even though most of the paths @xmath5 produced by map @xmath14 are short ( i.e. @xmath3 is highly peaked at @xmath28 ) , there is a non - negligible probability for very large values of @xmath5 to occur : notice that the values of @xmath29 at the edges of fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) mean that a particle has traveled about 160 periods of the rippled billiard between two successive collisions with the rippled boundary and ; ( ii ) @xmath3 decays as a power - law similar to eq .",
    "( [ levy ] ) .",
    "these two facts are explicit evidences of lvy flights in the dynamics of map @xmath14 .",
    "thus , the following question becomes pertinent : can we provide an analytic expression for the shape of @xmath3 given the simple form of map @xmath14 ?",
    "fortunately , the answer is positive as we will show it below .",
    "if we consider the dynamics of map @xmath14 to be in the regime of full chaos then a single trajectory can explore the full available phase space homogeneously , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) , so @xmath30 is constant and equal to @xmath31 , as verified in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) . also , from the second equation in map @xmath14 we obtain @xmath32 .",
    "thus , using @xmath33 , we can write @xmath34 which is in fact a lvy - type probability distribution function with @xmath1 ; compare with eq .",
    "( [ levy ] ) .",
    "then , in fig .  [ fig2](c )",
    "we plot eq .",
    "( [ levym ] ) ( as the red full line ) together with the numerically obtained @xmath3 and observe a very good correspondence making clear the existence of lvy processes , characterized by the power - law decay @xmath1 , in the dynamics of the rippled billiard .",
    "in fact , the origin of the lvy - type probability distribution of eq .",
    "( [ levym ] ) for the lengths @xmath5 in the ripple billiard is the existence of lvy flights .",
    "since a typical chaotic trajectory fills the available phase space uniformly , see fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) , then all angles @xmath35 are equally probable ; however , different angles produce quite different lengths @xmath5 .",
    "for example , an angle @xmath36 very close to @xmath37 corresponds to a very short length @xmath38 , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . while @xmath36 tending to zero or @xmath39 produce trajectories which are nearly parallel to the @xmath17-axis that may travel very long distances between successive collisions with the ripple boundary : in such case @xmath40 . these _ grazing _ trajectories are indeed lvy flights , known to produce heavy - tailed distribution functions @xcite ; for the ripple billiard the lvy flights produce eq .",
    "( [ levym ] ) as derived above .",
    "moreover , grazing trajectories in the ripple billiard have been found to play a prominent role when defining the classical analogs of the quantum _ structure of eigenstates _ and _ local density of states _",
    "@xcite .",
    "equation  ( [ levym ] ) is already an interesting result on the dynamics of the rippled billiard ( and of general chaotic extended billiards with infinite horizon ) that deserves additional attention , however our goal here is different .",
    "since now we know that map @xmath14 produces lvy flights characterized by @xmath1 we ask ourselves : can we propose a general 2d non - linear map where @xmath8 can be included as a parameter ? more generally , can we construct the map @xmath2 able to produce lvy flights characterized by @xmath4 ?",
    "indeed , in the following section we elaborate on these questions .",
    "we introduce the _ lvy map _ @xmath2 by following the opposite procedure we used above to obtain the distribution function of eq .",
    "( [ levym ] ) from map @xmath14 .",
    "let us    * consider the 2d map @xmath41 to have the same iteration relation for the angle @xmath36 as map @xmath14 , see eq .  ( [ m ] ) ,",
    "* assume the map @xmath2 to be in a regime of global chaos , such that @xmath42 and * demand the variable @xmath43 from map @xmath2 to be characterized by the lvy - type density distribution function @xmath44 where @xmath4 and @xmath45 is a normalization constant .",
    "then , @xmath46 provides @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , we define the _ lvy map _ as @xmath48 where @xmath13 , @xmath49 , and @xmath8 are the map parameters . we have introduced the absolute value in the second equation of @xmath2 to avoid fractional powers of negative angles .",
    "this , in turn , makes all _ lengths _ @xmath5 to be positive .    notice that for @xmath1 and @xmath50 , where @xmath51 , we recover map @xmath14 from @xmath2 ( with @xmath52 ) .",
    "we also note that @xmath2 has a similar form than the maps studied in refs .",
    "@xcite in the sense that the function @xmath53 , in the second line of the map @xmath2 , is inverse proportional to @xmath54 to a non - integer power .    below we will focus our attention on map @xmath2 with the parameter @xmath8 into the interval @xmath4 because our motivation is to construct a map able to produce pseudo - random variables distributed according to @xmath8-stable distributions",
    ". however , the parameter @xmath8 may also take values outside this interval .",
    "in general , depending on the values of the parameters @xmath55 , the dynamics of the lvy map may be integrable , mixed ( where the phase space contains periodic islands surrounded by chaotic seas which may be limited by invariant spanning curves ) , or ergodic .",
    "that is , the classical phase space of map @xmath2 develops the generic transition to global chaos ( not shown here ) .",
    "however , for eq .",
    "( [ pofteta ] ) to be valid the map dynamics must be ergodic . therefore , below , by applying chirikov s overlapping resonance criteria we shall identify the onset of global chaos as a function of the parameters of the lvy map .    following @xcite we linearize @xmath2 around the period - one fixed points @xmath56 , which are defined through @xmath57 this condition provides @xmath58 then , for an angle close to @xmath59 we can write @xmath60 getting @xmath61 thus , @xmath62 in addition , for @xmath17 we have @xmath63 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & x_n + 2\\pi m [ 1-(\\gamma/2\\pi m)^{-\\alpha}\\delta\\theta_{n+1 } ] \\nonumber \\\\ & = & x_n - \\gamma^{-\\alpha } ( 2\\pi m)^{\\alpha+1}\\delta\\theta_{n+1 } \\ . \\label{xn1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] finally , by substituting the new angle @xmath64 in ( [ deltateta ] ) and ( [ xn1 ] ) we can write the linearized map @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath17 , respectively , play the role of action - angle variables in the _ standard map _ @xcite with @xmath67 being the stochasticity parameter .",
    "chirikov s overlapping resonance criteria predicts the transition to global chaos for @xmath68 , where @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "global chaos means that chaotic regions are interconnected over the whole phase space ( stability islands may still exist but are sufficiently small that the chaotic sea extends throughout the vast majority of phase space ) .",
    "this criteria for the lvy map reads as @xmath70 in fact , to get eq .",
    "( [ caosg ] ) from eq .",
    "( [ k ] ) we have applied the resonance criteria to the period - one fixed point corresponding to @xmath71 , see eq .",
    "( [ fp ] ) , which is the fixed point having the largest @xmath36 ( i.e. it is located highest in phase space ) and the one closer to the last invariant spanning curve bounding the diffusion of the variable @xmath36 .    indeed , we have verified that the phase space of @xmath2 is ergodic if condition ( [ caosg ] ) is satisfied ( not shown here ) . moreover , in figs .",
    "[ fig4](a - d ) we plot the phase distribution functions @xmath30 for the lvy map with @xmath72 corresponding to @xmath73 , 1/2 , 1 , and 3/2 . from these figures , it is clear that @xmath30 is certainly a constant distribution . in particular , note that with @xmath72 condition ( [ caosg ] ) is satisfied for any @xmath8 , so we shall use this set of parameter values in all figures below .     and",

    "a single initial condition @xmath77 was iterated @xmath78 times .",
    "the red full curve in ( e - h ) is @xmath79.,width=302 ]    now we would like to verify that once @xmath80 , @xmath2 must produce lengths @xmath81 distributed according to eq .",
    "( [ levy2 ] ) .",
    "however , we noticed that for @xmath82 the lvy map produces huge values of @xmath5 . to show this , in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we plot the typical value of @xmath5 , @xmath83 as a function of @xmath8 ; where we can observe that for @xmath73 the typical @xmath5 is larger than @xmath84 ( in fact , from the data we used to construct the @xmath30 of fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) we obtained several lengths @xmath5 of the order of @xmath85 ! ) .",
    "thus , it is not practical to construct @xmath3 to test the validity of eq .",
    "( [ levy2 ] ) itself . instead",
    ", we make the change of variable @xmath86 which leads to @xmath87 then in figs .",
    "[ fig4](e - h ) we show length distribution functions @xmath74 for the lvy map with @xmath73 , 1/2 , 1 , and 3/2 ( histograms ) .",
    "as clearly seen , the agreement between the histograms and @xmath79 ( shown as red thick lines ) is indeed excellent .",
    "it is relevant to stress that since the phase space of the lvy map is ergodic when condition ( [ caosg ] ) is satisfied , the sequences @xmath81 can then be considered as lvy - distributed pseudo - random numbers . in fact , in the next section we will show through a specific application that the lengths @xmath5 can be used in practice as random numbers .    , @xmath88 , for the lvy map @xmath2 as a function of @xmath8 .",

    "there is a good deal of work devoted to the use of non - linear maps as pseudo - random number generators , see some examples in refs .",
    "therefore , in a similar way , we would like to use the lvy map to generate pseudo - random numbers particularly distributed according to the lvy - type probability distribution function of eq .",
    "( [ levy2 ] ) .",
    "however , instead of analyzing the randomness of the sequences @xmath81 produced by @xmath2 , here we will show that these numbers can be successfully used already in a specific application : we shall compute transmission through one - dimensional ( 1d ) disordered wires .",
    "recently , the electron transport through 1d quantum wires with lvy - type disorder was studied in refs .",
    "there , it was found that the average ( over different disorder realizations ) of the logarithm of the dimensionless conductance @xmath89 behaves as @xmath90 where @xmath91 is a _ length _ that depends on the wire model .",
    "for example , for a wire represented as a sequence of potential barriers with random lengths , @xmath92 @xcite ; where @xmath93 is the length of the @xmath18th barrier in the wave propagation direction .",
    "while for a wire represented by the 1d anderson model with off - diagonal disorder , @xmath94 @xcite ; where @xmath95 is the hopping integral between the sites @xmath18 and @xmath96 .    here , we use the 1d anderson model with off - diagonal disorder to represent 1d quantum wires ( see details in the appendix ) where the hopping integrals @xmath95 are , in fact , the pseudo - random lengths @xmath5 generated by our lvy map .",
    "then , in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we plot @xmath97 as a function of @xmath91 for the 1d anderson model with lvy - type disorder characterized by @xmath73 , 1/2 , 1 , and 3/2 .",
    "we have computed the dimensionless conductance by the use of the effective hamiltonian approach ( see details in the appendix ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we are using @xmath98 to normalize @xmath91 to be able to show curves corresponding to different values of @xmath8 into the same figure panel . also , in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we are including fittings of the curves @xmath97 vs.  @xmath91 with eq .",

    "in this paper we have introduced the so - called _ lvy map _ : a two - dimensional nonlinear map characterized by tunable lvy flights .",
