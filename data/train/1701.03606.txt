    "networks describing complex systems in the real world are quite inhomogeneous and complicated @xcite . the number of edges from a node , namely degree , for example , is widely distributed in a network . in fact , many real - world complex networks have asymptotically power - law degree distributions , which is called the scale - free property @xcite .",
    "in addition , the degrees of adjacent nodes via an edge are usually correlated .",
    "such nearest neighbor degree correlations can be described by the joint probability @xmath0 of a randomly chosen edge connecting two nodes with degrees @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "it has been empirically known that nodes in social networks tend to be connected to nodes with similar degrees ( assortative mixing ) while technological or biological networks show the opposite tendency ( disassortative mixing ) @xcite .",
    "network complexity is also characterized by the shortest path distance ( number of edges along the shortest path ) between nodes . from this point of view",
    ", most of real - world networks can be classified into two classes @xcite , namely , small - world networks @xcite and fractal networks @xcite . in a small - world network ,",
    "the shortest path distance averaged over all node pairs increases logarithmically ( or more slowly ) with the total number of nodes . in other words ,",
    "the minimum number of subgraphs @xmath3 covering the entire network decreases exponentially ( or faster ) with the subgraph diameter , that is , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the maximum distance between any nodes in the subgraph ( subgraph diameter ) and @xmath6 is a constant .",
    "it has been shown that many real - world networks possess the small - world property @xcite . for a fractal network , on the other hand ,",
    "the number of covering subgraphs decreases with @xmath5 in a power - law manner , i.e. , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the fractal dimension of the network .",
    "this relation has been observed also in a diverse range of networks from the world wide web to some kinds of cellular networks @xcite .",
    "the origin of the fractal property in complex networks is still an open question @xcite , though the mechanism of the small - world network formation has been found in the existence of short - cut edges .",
    "it has , however , been empirically demonstrated that real - world and synthetic fractal scale - free networks have _ disassortative _ degree correlations @xcite .",
    "if the converse is also true , that is , disassortative mixing makes a scale - free network fractal , the origin of fractality would be found in the degree correlation .",
    "disassortativity is a local property characterizing nearest neighbor degree correlations , while fractality is a consequence of long - range structural correlations .",
    "this fact seems to deny the above possibility .",
    "it is , however , known that if edges in a scale - free network are rewired to maximize or minimize the assortativity @xmath9 while keeping the degree sequence ( and hence the degree distribution ) then the maximally assortative or disassortative network becomes to possess a long - range correlation @xcite .",
    "the assortativity @xmath9 is the pearson s correlation coefficient for degrees and defined by @xcite @xmath10^{2 } }    { \\displaystyle \\sum_{(i , j)\\in e}(k_{i}^{2}+k_{j}^{2})-\\frac{1}{2m}\\left[\\sum_{(i , j)\\in e}(k_{i}+k_{j})\\right]^{2 } } , \\label{eq_assortativity}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the degree of node @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the total number of edges , and @xmath14 is the set of undirected edges in the network .",
    "a maximally assortative network has an onionlike structure consisting of communities of regular subgraphs @xcite .",
    "such a network displays a long - range structural correlation in which maximum degree nodes are distant from minimum degree ones .",
    "a maximally disassortative ( md ) network also shows a community structure . in each community , all nodes with a specific low degree and higher degree nodes are connected alternately @xcite .",
    "thus , a minimum ( or maximum ) degree node is located far away from an intermediate degree node in the md network , which implies a long - range correlation .",
    "therefore , there is a possibility that even short - range disassortative degree mixing induces the long - range fractal correlation , as pointed out by ref .",
    "@xcite through the analysis of random critical branching trees .",
    "furthermore , considering the entropic origin of disassortativity @xcite , we can discuss the formation mechanism of fractal scale - free networks in connection with a process maximizing the entropy .    in this paper",
    ", we examine the possibility that a negative degree correlation between nearest neighbor nodes makes a scale - free network fractal . to this end , we first prepare an uncorrelated scale - free network that is guaranteed to become fractal by rewiring edges . then , this network is again rewired so that the nearest neighbor degree correlation becomes maximally negative . if the rewired md network exhibits the fractal nature , one can conclude that fractality of scale - free networks is induced by disassortative degree mixing . our results",
    ", however , show that disassortativity does not always make scale - free networks fractal .",
    "we also suggest that fractality seems to require a long - range repulsive correlation between similar degree nodes .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] , we explain how to prepare the initial network @xmath15 that can be fractal scale free by rewiring edges . the rewiring method to obtain md networks",

    ", we define the distance distribution function @xmath162 , where @xmath32 is the degree distribution , @xmath163 represents the summation over degrees of the top 2% of high degree nodes , and @xmath164 is the normalization constant . as expected , @xmath154 for the @xmath17-flower shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] is distributed in a wide range of @xmath126 , which implies that high degree nodes are likely to be largely separated from each other . the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] indicates @xmath154 for networks ( @xmath153 ) formed by rewiring many edges while keeping @xmath0 starting from the @xmath17-flower , where we should note that @xmath153 is a md network .",
    "the actual rewiring process can be done as follows : first we choose randomly two edges @xmath45 and @xmath46 with four different end nodes , where the degree of node @xmath165 is equal to the degree of node @xmath166 , then rewire them to @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the function @xmath154 for @xmath153 is distributed in a narrow range of small @xmath126 .",
    "the width of the distribution is , however , slightly wider than that for @xmath15 ( bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] ) formed by rr s starting from the @xmath17-flower .",
    "this is because higher degree nodes are never directly connected in @xmath153 .",
    "in addition to the @xmath17-flower , we examined @xmath154 for the www @xcite as a real - world scale - free fractal network .",
    "this network exhibits disassortative degree mixing ( @xmath167 ) and is known to have the fractal dimension @xmath168 @xcite . as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] , @xmath154 for the www has a long tail .",
    "if the network is rewired while keeping @xmath0 , @xmath154 becomes much narrower than that for the original www as seen by triangles in the inset and the network loses fractality .",
    "these results suggest that the fractal property of a scale - free network requires a long - range repulsive correlation between similar degree nodes , particularly hub nodes .",
    "we have studied the relation between fractality of scale - free networks and their degree correlations .",
    "real - world and synthetic fractal scale - free networks are known to exhibit disassortative degree mixing in common .",
    "it is , however , not obvious whether a negative correlation between nearest neighbor degrees causes the fractal property of a scale - free network , though the possibility of disassortativity being the origin of fractality is suggested . in order to clarify this point",
    ", we examined maximally disassortative ( md ) networks prepared by rewiring edges while keeping the degree sequence . for the preparation of md networks , uncorrelated networks are first formed by rewiring randomly edges of the @xmath17-flower",
    "then , these networks are again rewired to minimize the rank correlation coefficient @xmath52 .",
    "our results show that there exist a huge number of md networks with different topologies but most of them are not fractal .",
    "therefore , it is concluded that negative correlations between nearest neighbor degrees can not be the origin of fractality of scale - free networks .",
    "this can be readily understood if we consider md networks formed by unit rewiring operations starting from the @xmath17-flower , because unit - rewired networks can not have any structural correlations beyond the scale of the rewiring unit .",
    "in addition , we studied the long - range repulsion between hub nodes in fractal scale - free networks and their rewired networks while keeping the joint probability @xmath0 .",
    "the results for the @xmath17-flower and a real - world fractal scale - free network show that distances between large degree nodes in fractal scale - free networks are much longer than those in their rewired networks .",
    "this fact prompts the speculation that fractality of scale - free networks requires a long - range repulsive correlation in similar degrees .",
    "we should point out that networks treated in this work are a bit special .",
    "as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec:1 ] , md networks are generally composed of communities in each of which all nodes with a specific low degree and higher degree nodes are connected alternately .",
    "this gives md networks a long - range degree correlation . on the other hand , an md network with the same degree sequence as the @xmath17-flower ( @xmath169 )",
    "consists of only one community , because the total number of spokes from the lowest degree nodes is equal to or larger than that from all remaining higher degree nodes .",
    "we then can not expect the long - range degree correlation in md networks with the same degree sequence as the @xmath17-flower .",
    "nevertheless , our conclusion is considered to be still valid even for more general networks .",
    "this is because disassortative degree mixing does not introduce any long - range repulsive correlations between similar degree nodes in a community of a general md network .",
    "therefore , the md network is not fractal at least below the scale of the community .    our speculation about the long - range repulsive correlation between similar degree nodes for fractal scale - free networks should be checked by further investigations . for this purpose , it is significant to define a new index characterizing the strength of such a repulsive correlation .",
    "it is interesting to identify whether a network formed by rewiring edges to maximize this index becomes fractal .",
