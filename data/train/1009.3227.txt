    "the origin of the baryon asymmetry is one of the fundamental questions of cosmology .",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed : out - of - equilibrium decay of gut bosons , electroweak baryogenesis , affleck - dine baryogenesis , varieties of leptogenesis and many others .",
    "however , these mechanisms do not address the similarity of the mass density of baryons and dark matter , @xmath4 .",
    "this has motivated several models which attempt to unify the origin of baryons and of dark matter , which typically relate the baryon asymmetry to a dark matter asymmetry @xcite .",
    "supersymmetric models which relate baryon number and dark matter via conserved r - parity have also been proposed @xcite .",
    "we refer to these as direct models , as they directly relate the _ number _ density of the baryons to that of dark matter . as a result",
    ", the mass of the dark matter particle has to be light , typically @xmath5 gev .",
    "( exceptions have been suggested in @xcite . ) recently , a number of models based on @xmath6-mass asymmetric dark matter have been proposed @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to relate the baryon and dark matter densities _ indirectly _ , by having similar mechanisms for the generation of the observed densities .",
    "an mssm - based example was in given @xcite , where the baryon number originates from affleck - dine leptogenesis while the dark matter density is due to coherently - oscillating right - handed sneutrinos .",
    "both the baryon and dark matter density are from flat directions with the same dimension , in which case their mass densities are related .",
    "the advantage of such indirect models is that they allow a wider range of dark matter particle mass , which is not constrained by a tight relation between the baryon and dark matter number densities .    however , most models which address the baryon to dark matter ratio problem sacrifice another coincidence , the similarity of the observed dark matter density to a typical thermal relic wimp density , the so - called `` wimp miracle '' .",
    "ideally we would construct a framework which relates the baryon and dark matter densities while retaining the connection to the thermal relic wimp density .",
    "this could be achieved if the dark matter is a conventional wimp while the _ final _ baryon asymmetry is determined by a process which is similar to the process responsible for thermal wimp densities i.e. the freeze - out of annihilations of dark matter particles which have an annihilation cross - section of broadly weak - interaction strength .",
    "the goal of this paper is to present a model which demonstrates such a process .",
    "we emphasize that the framework is more general than the implementation we present here .",
    "we do not address the origin of the initial baryon asymmetry , but instead concentrate on how this can be modified to become a thermal wimp - like density , hence `` baryomorphosis '' rather than `` baryogenesis '' .",
    "we will show that a generic feature of such models are new particles , which we term `` annihilons '' , which allow annihilation of the initial baryon asymmetry down to a thermal wimp - like density . depending on their standard model ( sm ) gauge charges",
    ", these could provide a distinctive signature of the model at colliders .",
    "to show how it is possible to generate a baryon asymmetry which is related to a thermal relic wimp density , we will construct two versions of a simple scalar field - based model , although the framework can apply to a wide range of models .",
    "the ingredients of the model are a heavy complex scalar @xmath7 which has a large asymmetry and a pair of scalar annihilons @xmath0 and @xmath1 , of mass @xmath2 , oppositely charged under the sm and carrying baryon number , to which @xmath7 will decay .",
    "we also require a scalar multiplet , @xmath8 , to which the annihilons can annihilate .",
    "finally we require operators which allow @xmath0 and @xmath1 to decay to a conventional baryon asymmetry .",
    "we will not discuss the origin of the initial @xmath7 asymmetry , as our concern is its conversion to a thermal wimp - like baryon density , but we will show that the @xmath7 asymmetry can evade thermalization and erasure .",
    "the essential interaction terms are _ decay = _",
    "b^2 ^2 + h. c.   and _ _ b ann = _ b _ b ^ + h. c.  .in principle @xmath8 can be any scalar multiplet . in order to explore the possibility that @xmath8 is the conventional higgs boson , @xmath9 , we will assume that @xmath8 has the same quantum numbers as @xmath9 .",
    "as we will show , @xmath8 can not develop a significant expectation value if the baryon asymmetry is to evade washout . in order for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 to decay to a conventional baryon asymmetry",
    ", we couple them to quarks .",
    "we will consider two examples in which @xmath0 and @xmath1 carries sm gauge charges : ( i ) @xmath0 and @xmath1 carry only hypercharge ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) ; ( ii ) @xmath0 and @xmath1 are colour triplets with hypercharge ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) .",
    "for case ( i ) the operators transferring the baryon number to quarks are _ _ b decay = _ b _ u^c _ d^c _ d^c _ e^c + h. c.  _ decay = _ u^c _ u^c _ q _",
    "l + h. c.  , where @xmath14 are two - component spinors and gauge and generation indices are suppressed . in this case @xmath15 and @xmath16 . for case ( ii )",
    "the operators are _ _ b decay = _ b _ u^c _ e^c _ l _",
    "l + h. c.  _ decay = _ u^c _ d^c _ l _ l + h. c.  .in this case @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .    at this point",
    "it must be emphasized that there are other couplings which are allowed by the symmetries of the model but which must be suppressed in order to evade b washout or too rapid annihilon decay . in particular , as discussed later , the b - violating mass term @xmath20 must be suppressed , which can not be achieved by any symmetry which permits .",
    "there are also other smaller dimension operators leading to @xmath0 , @xmath1 decay processes which must be suppressed , for example @xmath21 in model ( i ) .",
    "in addition , we must assume that @xmath7 does not couple directly to sm fields .",
    "since there is no symmetry which can explain these suppressions , they must be assumed to occur as a result of the underlying dynamics of a more complete theory .",
    "this does not rule out the possibility of a baryomorphosis model which evades the need for ad hoc suppressions .",
    "the purpose of the models we are considering here is to illustrate how baryomorphosis models might work and the potential difficulties encountered in implementing baryomorphosis in practice .",
    "the sequence of events is as follows .",
    "we assume that a large asymmetry in @xmath7 scalars exists down to a low temperature ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the @xmath7 particles decay at @xmath23 to @xmath0 , @xmath1 pairs via , resulting in equal @xmath0 and @xmath1 asymmetries .",
    "we assume that @xmath23 is less than the freeze - out temperature of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 scalars , @xmath24 , and that the number density of @xmath0 , @xmath1 produced by @xmath7 decay is large enough that the @xmath0 , @xmath1 density can subsequently annihilate via .",
    "we will assume that @xmath25 is of a natural order of magnitude from a dimensional viewpoint , @xmath26 .",
    "it is essential that @xmath25 is not very small compared with 1 in order that the b - violating annihilations are of a similar strength to those of wimps .",
    "since the mass of @xmath0 and @xmath1 is assumed to be roughly weak scale and @xmath1 masses are equal , although in general they could have different masses .",
    "] , @xmath27 , the annihilation cross - section from is broadly of weak - interaction strength .",
    "the resulting @xmath0 asymmetry therefore corresponds to thermal relic wimp - like density , although the @xmath0 , @xmath1 density freezes - out at a value larger than a thermal relic density . at this stage",
    "the baryon asymmetry is entirely in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 . to convert this to a conventional baryon asymmetry , the @xmath0",
    ", @xmath1 density decays at @xmath28 to quarks via - , where @xmath29 is the temperature of nucleosynthesis .",
    "the non - relativistic annihilation rate times relative velocity for @xmath30 is @xcite v =  .(annihilons may be relativistic when first produced but scattering from the sm thermal background will rapidly slow them . ) assuming @xmath7 decays to @xmath0 , @xmath1 at @xmath23 , annihilations due to reduce the number density to n__b(t_d ) =  .",
    "( a similar density of @xmath1 will be produced . )",
    "we can relate this to the thermal relic @xmath0 density at @xmath23 due to @xmath31 ( i.e. the density of thermal relic @xmath0 scalars in the case when all interactions other then are neglected ) , n__b(t_d ) = n__bth(t_d )  , where @xmath24 is the @xmath0 freeze - out temperature due to and we assume that @xmath32 .",
    "( as usual , @xmath33 is the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom . )",
    "if the @xmath0 subsequently decays to conventional baryons , then the mass density in baryons ( assuming the baryon number of @xmath0 equals 1 ) is _ b h^2 = _ _ b th h^2  , where @xmath34 would be the thermal relic @xmath0 density due to if they did not decay , which is a typical thermal relic wimp density if @xmath35 and @xmath36 @xcite , _ _ b th =  , where @xmath37 is the critical density , @xmath38 and during radiation - domination @xmath39 where @xmath40 .",
    "( @xmath41 . )",
    "typically @xmath42 .",
    "note that there could be symmetric thermal relic densities of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , but these are typically small compared to the asymmetric density ( since @xmath32 ) and in any case do not contribute to the final baryon number . therefore _",

    "this assumes that @xmath32 , where t__b = m__bx__b = 50 ( ) ( 20 x__b )  .",
    "therefore if @xmath7 decays to @xmath0 , @xmath1 at a sufficiently low temperature then the initial @xmath0 and @xmath1 asymmetry will annihilate down to a thermal relic wimp - like density determined by a broadly weak - interaction strength annihilation cross - section .",
    "it arises from a process very similar to the freeze - out of annihilations of a thermal equilibrium wimp density , but here the @xmath0 density is greater than the thermal equilibrium density when the annihilations freeze - out .",
    "note that the greater - than - equlibrium @xmath0 density can compensate for the small nucleon mass in the final @xmath46 , allowing @xmath46 to become comparable to a typical wimp dark matter density .",
    "the relic baryon asymmetry is typically of the order of magnitude of the observed dark matter density @xmath47 . in fig.1",
    "we show @xmath48 as a function of @xmath23 and @xmath49 for the case where @xmath50",
    ". the @xmath7 decay temperature must be low enough , @xmath32 , for the baryon asymmetry to avoid being erased by b - violating @xmath0 @xmath1 annihilations .",
    "since the puzzle of the baryon and dark matter densities is why they are within an order of magnitude , we have plotted the region where @xmath51 . from fig.1",
    "we see that a large fraction of the allowed @xmath23 , @xmath49 parameter space has @xmath46 and @xmath47 within an order of magnitude .",
    "therefore provided @xmath23 is low enough for @xmath7 decays to produce a baryon asymmetry ( but high enough to allow standard nucleosynthesis ) , the model naturally explains why the baryon and dark matter mass densities are similar .",
    "the baryon asymmetry in @xmath0 and @xmath1 must decay to a conventional baryon asymmetry .",
    "this occurs via the operators in - .",
    "the @xmath0 , @xmath1 decay rate to standard model ( sm ) quarks and leptons can be estimated to be _ _ b k_p  , where @xmath52 is a kinematical factor for decay to 4-body final states .",
    "decay occurs once @xmath53 .",
    "therefore the mass @xmath54 as a function of decay temperaure is @xmath55 = 5 10 ^ 7 ( ) ^1/6 ( ) ^1/3 ( ) ^7/6  .",
    "the lifetime of the annihilons may provide a signature for such particles at colliders .",
    "the @xmath0 decay temperature satisfies @xmath56 .",
    "this range translates into a lifetime @xmath57 which is characteristically long , 1.5 s 8 10 ^ -9 ( ) ^2 s  .",
    "the lower bound can be short enough to allow annihilons to decay within particle detectors , depending on @xmath23 .",
    "in order to have a consistent scenario we must check that ( a ) the initial @xmath7 asymmetry does not come into thermal equilibrium , since in this case the @xmath7 asymmetry will be erased by the interaction , ( b ) scattering of @xmath0 , @xmath1 from thermal background sm fermions via does not erase the baryon asymmetry in @xmath0 , @xmath1 and ( c ) that the b - violating interaction does not induce rapid proton decay .      we will consider the @xmath7 particles to have zero momentum , as would be the case if they formed a coherently oscillating condensate .",
    "this case will give the largest scattering rate of @xmath7 by the thermal background @xmath0 particles , so the bounds obtained will be conservative .",

    "this demonstrates an interesting conenction between the required low value of @xmath23 and the survival of the @xmath7 asymmetry : the large value of @xmath61 which is necessary to have @xmath32 also ensures that @xmath7 is out of thermal equilibrium .",
    "we must ensure that the b - violating interaction does not lead to washout of the baryon asymmetry in @xmath0 , @xmath1 . in the case where @xmath8 gains an expectation value ,",
    "the mass squared term due to results in mixing of @xmath0 and @xmath72 .",
    "this will cause b - violating scattering @xmath73 with the thermal background sm fermions @xmath74 due to t - channel higgs and gauge boson exchange processes .",
    "in addition it will cause oscillations of the initial @xmath75 state from @xmath7 decay to its conjugate .",

    ", this requires that @xmath84 . since this very small value for",
    "@xmath25 would undermine the weak interaction strength of the annihilation process from , we can not consider @xmath8 to be the sm higgs doublet .",
    "however , if @xmath8 is a second doublet which does not develop an expectation value then the problem of b - violation due to mixing will be avoided , which must be cancelled by counterterms to the level @xmath85 .",
    "this would be a problem in theories where the scalar masses are calculable and are required to be naturally weak scale , such as models with a physical tev cut - off or weak - scale supersymmetry .",
    "but if the cut - off is infinite and the quadratic divergences are unsuppressed , as in the sm , then scalar mass terms can not be calculated but are instead treated as phenomenological inputs in the renormalization procedure . ] .",
    "in this case we must ensure that either @xmath8 decays before nucleosynthesis or that the relic density of stable @xmath8 is sufficiently small .",
    "one possibility is that @xmath8 could decay to sm fermions via yukawa - like couplings .",
    "alternatively , if @xmath8 is stable ( for example if there is a @xmath86-symmetry @xmath87 ) , then it would be a candidate for inert doublet dark matter @xcite .",
    "this would have the advantage of introducing a wimp candidate into the sm while simultaneously accounting for a wimp - like baryon asymmetry .",
    "we will return to this possibility in future work .",
    "the final requirement is that the b - violating interaction does not lead to rapid proton decay .",
    "the mass scales of the particles and of the interactions - are relatively low , so we should check that rapid proton decay does not occur due to the combination of and - .",
    "the strongest effective b - violating quark interaction which can lead to proton decay is obtained by introducing a mass splitting @xmath88 for @xmath0 , @xmath1 ( where @xmath85 in order to evade b washout ) and integrating out the heavy @xmath0 and @xmath1 , as in fig.2 . for the model",
    "where @xmath0 , @xmath1 are colour singlets with hypercharge this gives _",
    "eff = ( _ u^c _ d^c _ d^c _ e^c ) ( _ u^c _ u^c _ q",

    "the characteristic feature of these models are the annihilons which carry baryon number and annihilate to a wimp - like thermal relic baryon density .",
    "annihilons in general would be long - lived massive particles , with typically @xmath93 .",
    "the prospect for producing and identifying these at colliders depends on their sm gauge charges .",
    "the best prospect would be the case where the annihilons are coloured scalars . in this case they could be pair produced at the lhc via gluon fusion .",
    "coloured annihilons would combine with quarks to form heavy hadron - like particles with unusual charge and baryon number assignments .",
    "their decay to baryon number could be observed if the annihilons could decay or be stopped within a detector . for example , for the coloured scalar annihilon example discussed in this paper , the @xmath1 can be produced as heavy @xmath1-hadrons e.g. @xmath94 , which has @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "such long - lived exotic hadrons ( with various possible charge and baryon number assignments ) are a generic prediction of baryomorphosis models in the case where the annihilons are coloured",
    ".    it may also be possible to produce and detect annihilons at colliders in the case where they carry only electroweak quantum numbers .",
    "we will return to annihilon production and detection at colliders in more detail in a future discussion .",
    "the origin of the observed baryon asymmetry is a fundamental question in cosmology . in particular , the similarity of the baryon and dark matter mass densities may be a hint as to the origin of both densities .",
    "however , existing models which relate these densities neglect the other well - known coincidence , the similarity of the observed dark matter density to a typical thermal relic wimp density , the so - called wimp miracle .",
    "an alternative to directly connecting the dark matter and baryon densities is to indirectly relate the observed baryon density to the thermal relic wimp density i.e. to have similar but seperate mechanisms for the origin of the observed densities rather than directly connecting them to a common origin .",
    "this also has the advantage that it does not restrict the mass of the dark matter particle to be light . in this paper",
    "we have shown how this might be done , by modifying an initial large baryon asymmetry to a final asymmetry determined by a wimp - like baryon number - violating interaction , a framework we have termed `` baryomorphosis '' .",
    "this generically requires new particles in the 100 gev - 1 tev range , `` annihilons '' , which carry baryon number and which can annihilate to reduce the initially large baryon asymmetry to a thermal relic wimp - like density .",
    "this framework requires a number of conditions to be satisifed , in particular the low temperature at which the initial asymmetry is transferred to annihilons and the late decay of annihilons to quarks .",
    "the low value of @xmath23 is phemonemologcally essential , since if @xmath23 is greater than the freeze - out temperature of the b - violating annihilation process then the baryon asymmetry will be completely erased .",
    "we have noted an encouraging consistency between the low temperature of annihilon decay and the requirement that the initial baryon asymmetry is not erased by b - violating annihilation processes .",
    "although the final baryon to dark matter density ratio is sensitive to @xmath23 , the mass of the annihilon and the strength of the b - violating interaction , we find that a large fraction of the @xmath23 , @xmath49 parameter space allowed by non - erasure of the baryon asymmetry and by nucleosynthesis is consistent with @xmath46 and @xmath47 being within an order of magnitude .",
    "therefore the model can naturally account for the observed value of @xmath97 provided @xmath23 is low enough and @xmath0 , @xmath1 can decay to quarks before nucleosynthesis .",
    "the model we have presented may also be considered as an illustration of the conditions necessary to explain a thermal wimp - like baryon density and so the plausibility of explaining this feature of the observed universe mechanistically . if the conditions appear implausible , then the possible conclusions are ( i ) the `` wimp miracle '' explanation of dark matter is correct but no mechanistic connection with the baryon density is possible , in which case anthropic selection must determine the baryon asymmetry , or ( ii ) the baryon asymmetry and dark matter density are mechanistically related to each other , but the `` wimp miracle '' is not the explanation of the dark matter density .",
    "( we are discounting the possibility that the similarity of the baryon and dark matter densities is just a coincidence . ) from our model it is clear that some highly non - trivial features and conditions are required : the injection of a large primordial baryon asymmetry at low temperature @xmath98 , the evasion of b washout due to the b - violating annihilation process , and the long lifetime of the annihilons ( long enough for them to survive until the time of asymmetry injection but short enough to allow them to decay before nucleosynthesis ) .",
    "in particular , a number of mass terms and couplings which are allowed by the symmetries of the model must be suppressed .",
    "should such conditions be difficult to satisfy in a natural particle physics model , it would be an indication that either the similarity of the thermal relic wimp density to the observed dark matter density is a coincidence with no physical significance or that anthropic selection of the baryon asymmetry must play a fundmental role in determining the state of the universe at present .",
    "experimental tests of such models are important in order to eliminate the need for aesthetic judgements regarding their naturalness .",
    "we have noted that the annihilons will have properties which may allow them to be identified if they can be produced at colliders , in particular a long lifetime @xmath99",
    "s. most promising would be the case of coloured annihilons , which would form heavy hadron - like states with unusual combinations of charge and baryon number , which might either be stopped and their decay observed , or possibly decay within a collider detector .",
    "we emphasize that the simple scalar field models we have presented here are intended to introduce a general framework and to understand the conditions necessary to implement it .",
    "we expect that this framework , baryomorphosis , can be realized in a wide range of models , some of which may be able to address the naturalness issues encountered in the simple models presented here .",
