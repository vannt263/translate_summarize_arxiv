    "core - collapse supernovae have been considered as a source of gravitational waves ( gws ) since the 1960s @xcite .",
    "while they may have been ousted by compact binary mergers as the most promising source for the first direct detection of gws by now , the prospective gw signal from a nearby supernova may still provide enormously important clues about the dynamics in the supernova core , shed light on the nature of the explosion mechanism , and could possibly provide constraints for the equation of state ( eos ) of neutron star matter . if supernovae are to become a fruitful subject of the future field of observational gw astronomy , this will require reliable waveform predictions , and these can only be based on simulations that accurately capture the evolution from the collapse through several hundreds of milliseconds of accretion by the stalled shock front into the explosion phase  a formidable challenge considering the host of different factors ( neutrino transport , multi - dimensional hydrodynamical instabilities , general relativity , eos physics , etc . )",
    "that influence the dynamics .",
    "there is a number of possible scenarios for gw emission from supernovae . _",
    "progenitors already produce a signal during the phases of collapse and bounce due to the breaking of spherical symmetry , a scenario which has long received interest from the numerical relativity community in particular ( see @xcite for an extensive review ) .",
    "state - of - the art predictions of the gw signal come from 2d and 3d general relativistic simulations @xcite employing a parametrized `` deleptonization scheme '' for the core - collapse phase @xcite , and , most recently , a neutrino leakage treatment for the post - bounce phase @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of this current approach is yet to be tested against self - consistent models including neutrino transport , but it is conceivable that the dynamics of rotational collapse can be captured reasonably well even with a simplified neutrino treatment .",
    "however , the fact that most supernova progenitors are believed to rotate rather slowly @xcite implies that the signal from rotational core bounce may be weak and difficult to detect .",
    "the situation is different for the gws produced by the different hydrodynamical instabilities that develop during the post - bounce phase also in non - rotating progenitors , such as convection in the proto - neutron star ( as first pointed out by @xcite ) , in the neutrino - heated hot - bubble region @xcite , the standing accretion - shock instability ( `` sasi '' , @xcite ) .",
    "regardless of the actual nature of the explosion mechanism , the evolution during the post - bounce phase depends crucially on the effects of neutrino heating and cooling and thus requires an elaborate treatment of the microphysics and in particular of the neutrino transport .",
    "because of this constraint , studies addressing the gw signal from the first several hundreds of milliseconds of the post - bounce evolution have been limited either to the newtonian approximation or the `` pseudo - newtonian effective potential '' approach @xcite until now . since the 1990s",
    ", several authors have investigated the problem in 2d and 3d , mostly relying on parametrized approximations for the neutrino heating and cooling @xcite , the idsa method @xcite , or on gray neutrino transport schemes @xcite .",
    "in addition , gravitational waveforms from state - of - the art multi - group neutrino hydrodynamics simulations of core - collapse supernovae have become available during the recent years @xcite .",
    "these different ( pseudo-)newtonian studies have by now established the qualitative features of the gw signal from the post - bounce phase : during the first several tens of milliseconds , prompt post - shock convection gives rise to a quasi - periodic signal in the range around @xmath1 @xcite , which is followed by a period of reduced gw activity until hot - bubble convection and the sasi become vigorous and lead to the emission of a stochastic signal with typical frequencies of several hundreds of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "after the onset of the explosion , asymmetric shock expansion may produce a `` tail '' , i.e.  a growing offset , in the gw amplitude @xcite , and a high - frequency signal from proto - neutron star convection starts to appear .",
    "tail - like signals may also result from anisotropic neutrino emission @xcite powered by accretion downflows onto the proto - neutron star .",
    "however , the accuracy of the newtonian approximation and even of the `` effective potential '' approach , which have formed the basis of gw predictions for the post - bounce phase so far , is limited .",
    "both 1d studies @xcite as well as the recent 2d models of our own group @xcite and exploratory gr simulations with simplified transport in 3d @xcite have demonstrated that gr effects have a non - negligible impact on the neutrino emission , the shock position , and the heating conditions in the supernova core .",
    "it is conceivable that gr affects the gw signal to a similar degree . to address this question , we present gravitational waveforms from axisymmetric ( 2d ) general relativistic simulations ( using the xcfc approximation of @xcite ) of the post - bounce phase including multi - group neutrino transport for the first time . we compare our results with predictions from newtonian and pseudo - newtonian models .",
    "we discuss the relativistic gw signals of six different progenitors with zero - age main sequence masses ranging from @xmath3 to @xmath4 ( among them five explosion models ) , part of which have already been studied in @xcite ( paper  ii ) and @xcite . for a @xmath5 star ,",
    "two simulations using the newtonian approximation and the effective potential approach provide the basis for diagnosing gr effects and for working out the reason of systematic differences where possible .",
    "we also consider a @xmath6 model with slightly simplified neutrino rates from @xcite .",
    "although the models analyzed in this paper represent the state - of - the - art in 2d core - collapse supernova simulations with energy - dependent neutrino transport , we emphasize that the quest towards better explosion models  ultimately from 3d gr simulations  is continuing apace .",
    "for an overview of the current status , the remaining uncertainties of the current generation of models , and future directions in the field the reader should refer to @xcite as well as recent review articles @xcite .",
    "our paper is structured as follows : in section  [ sec : numerics ] , we briefly summarize the numerical methods and the model setup , which is laid out in greater detail in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* paper  i and ii ) . in section  [",
    "sec : extraction ] , we describe the methods used for extracting and analyzing the gravitational wave signals .",
    "the wave signals produced during the different phases of the post - bounce evolution  the early phase of shock propagation and prompt post - shock convection , the steady - state accretion phase , and the explosion phase  are discussed in section  [ sec : general_features ] on the basis of two exemplary explosion models .",
    "the dependence of the gravitational wave emission on the progenitor model is discussed separately in section  [ sec : progenitors ] . finally , we summarize the most salient features of our relativistic waveforms in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "important technical issues relied upon in our paper , such as the derivation of a modified gw quadrupole formula , analytic expressions for the gw signal produced by an aspherical shock front , and the brunt - visl ( buoyancy ) frequency in gr are treated in appendices  a , b and c. note that different from the rest of the paper we use geometrical units ( @xmath7 ) in the appendix .",
    "we analyze the gw emission for several 2d simulations performed with the general relativistic neutrino hydrodynamics code vertex - coconut @xcite or its ( pseudo)-newtonian counterpart vertex - prometheus @xcite .",
    "the reader should refer to these papers for an in - depth description of the numerical methods and the input physics ( including the choice of progenitor models , neutrino interaction rates , and the equation of state ) . at this point",
    ", we confine ourselves to a summary of those technical aspects that are directly relevant for the present paper with its focus on gw signals .",
    "the hydrodynamics modules coconut and prometheus used in conjunction with the neutrino transport solver vertex both rely on similar higher - order finite - volume techniques , but differ in their treatment of general relativity .",
    "prometheus solves the equation of newtonian hydrodynamics , but can optionally account for some effects of strong - field gravity by means of a modified gravitational potential ( `` effective potential '' ; @xcite ) .",
    "by contrast , the general relativistic equations of hydrodynamics are solved in coconut @xcite , and the extended conformal flatness approximation ( xcfc , @xcite ) is used for the space - time metric .",
    "comparisons of xcfc with the full adm formalism in the context of rotational core - collapse have shown excellent agreement @xcite and suggest that it is fully adequate for capturing the dynamics in the supernova core",
    ". however , xcfc is a waveless approximation so that we need to extract the gw signal in a post - processing step with the help of a suitable version of the quadrupole formula ( see section  [ sec : extraction ] ) .    the neutrino transport module vertex solves the energy - dependent neutrino moment equations for all neutrino flavors using a variable eddington factor technique @xcite and relies on the so - called `` ray - by - ray - plus '' approximation for multi - dimensional neutrino transport @xcite .",
    "the ray - by - ray - plus approach allows us to predict angular variations in the neutrino radiation field ( and hence the low - frequency gw signal generated by the neutrinos ) at least in rough qualitative agreement with full multi - angle transport @xcite .    in total",
    ", we simulate the evolution of six different progenitor models with zero - age main sequence masses ranging from @xmath3 to @xmath8 ( simulations g8.1g27 ) .",
    "these include a metal - poor @xmath9 ( @xmath10 solar metallicity ) progenitor ( model u8.1 in @xcite ) , and a metal - free @xmath11 star ( z9.6 , alexander heger , private communication ) , while the other progenitors ( models s11.2 , s25.0 and s27.0 of @xcite and model s15s7b2 of @xcite ) have solar metallicity .",
    "three of the progenitors ( z9.6 , s25.0 , s27.0 ) were simulated using the equation of state of @xcite with a bulk incompressibility modulus of nuclear matter of @xmath12 ( ls220 ) , whereas @xmath13 ( ls180 ) was applied in all other cases .",
    "because of very similar proto - neutron star radii for the neutron star masses encountered in this study , ls220 and ls180 yield very similar results , and the use of ls180 for some of the progenitors is justified despite its marginal inconsistency with the @xmath14 pulsar @xcite .",
    "dynamical 1d simulations for the two eoss with vertex show a very similar evolution of the shock and proto - neutron star radius as well as the neutrino luminosities and mean energies ( l.  hdepohl , private communication ) , a finding that is in agreement with 1d results of @xcite , @xcite , and of @xcite , who have also found an extremely similar behavior also in 2d .",
    "the general features of the gravitational wave signal from the post - bounce accretion and explosion phases are discussed on the basis of the @xmath15 progenitor of @xcite and the @xmath5 model s15s7b2 of @xcite as prototypes for `` early '' and `` late '' explosions . for the @xmath6 progenitor",
    ", we also consider three models with a different treatment of gravity ( g15 : gr ; m15 : effective potential ; n15 : purely newtonian ) , as well as a gr model ( s15 ) with simplified neutrino rates in order to explore the impact of these factors on the gw signal .",
    "the simplifications in model s15 include the use of the ffn rates @xcite for electron captures on nuclei , a simpler treatment of neutrino - nucleon reactions , and the omission of neutrino - neutrino pair conversion ( see paper  ii for details ) .    except for the @xmath16 case",
    ", explosions have been obtained for all progenitors with gr and with the full set of neutrino rates .",
    "figure  [ fig : model_dynamics ] provides a compact overview over the relativistic ( g-)series of simulations : models g8.1 and g9.6 explode rather early and exhibit convective activity only on a moderate level after the onset of the explosion .",
    "the @xmath15 model g11.2 shows a much slower expansion of the shock and several violent shock oscillations before the explosion takes off .",
    "model g15 develops a very asymmetric explosion as late as @xmath17 .",
    "the more massive @xmath16 and @xmath4 models g25 and g27 differ from the other models by a more clearly discernible sasi activity , visible as strong periodic sloshing motions of the shock in figure  [ fig : model_dynamics ] , which lead to an explosion in the case of g27 .",
    "we note that no explosion develops in the simulations without gr and/or the full neutrino rates ( m15 , n15 , s15 ) .",
    "a summary of all nine models considered in this paper is given in table  [ tab : model_setup ] .",
    "for a detailed discussion of models g11.2 and g15 , see @xcite , and for details on g8.1 and g27 , see @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "after having discussed the different phases of gw emission for models g11.2 and g15 , we now turn to the progenitor dependence of the gw signal .",
    "models g8.1g27 exhibit a widely different behavior in the accretion and ( where applicable ) the explosion phase , and thus illustrate how the gw emission is correlated with important parameters characterizing the dynamical evolution such as the explosion time , the proto - neutron star mass , or the mass accretion rate . while the precise dynamics of individual progenitors ( time and energy of the explosion , etc . )",
    "may depend on uncertainties in the modeling ( 3d effects , progenitor structure , etc . )",
    ", the spectrum of models presented here already reveals such general trends very well .",
    "an overview over the waveforms for models g8.1g27 is given in figure  [ fig : panorama ] , and time - integrated gw energy spectra are shown in figure  [ fig : spectra_progenitors ] .",
    "table  [ tab : progenitors ] summarizes important characteristic numbers for the waveforms and spectra .",
    "figure  [ fig : panorama ] and table  [ tab : progenitors ] illustrate a few general trends in the gw signals : gw activity tends to increase for models with higher accretion rate @xmath18 during the phase of convective and sasi activity .",
    "table  [ tab : progenitors ] shows that except for model g25 there is a strong correlation between the accretion rate @xmath19 at a post - bounce time of @xmath20 ( typically close to the onset of strong convection / sasi ) and the total gravitational wave energy @xmath21 as well as the maximum amplitude @xmath22 .",
    "this correlation is reasonable , since the typical gw amplitude depends on the mass in the gain and cooling regions participating in violent aspherical motions and g - mode activity , respectively , both of these masses in turn regulated by the accretion rate .",
    "naturally , @xmath19 should not be understood as a single unambiguous parameter regulating the gw emission ; it is rather the overall evolution of @xmath18 that is relevant .",
    "because of vastly different accretion rates , models g9.6 and g27 constitute two extreme cases on the scale of gw emission : in model g9.6 , the accretion rate drops so quickly that there is almost no signal from hot - bubble convection , and only the early quasi - periodic signal remains .",
    "moreover , although there is some convective overturn in the ejecta in this model , the rather rapid explosion largely precludes the excitation of pns surface g - modes by downflows or accretion downdrafts . the matter affected by overturn",
    "is blown out rather quickly ahead of the developing neutrino - driven wind ( cp .",
    "top right panel of figure  [ fig : model_dynamics ] ) .",
    "by contrast , a lot of mass is involved in strong sasi oscillations prior to the onset of the explosion in model g27 ( bottom right panel of figure  [ fig : model_dynamics ] ) . moreover",
    ", the shock does not expand as rapidly afterwards , thus allowing violent aspherical motions to continue for several hundreds of milliseconds beyond the onset of the explosion .",
    "consequently , the energy emitted into gravitational waves is as high as @xmath23 for this model .",
    "while the models g8.1 , g11.2 , and g15 fit nicely into a continuum between these extreme cases , model g25 shows _ less _ gw activity than model g27 although it is characterized by even higher mass accretion rates as well as by continuing sasi activity ( bottom left panel of figure  [ fig : model_dynamics ] ) .",
    "this reversal of the aforementioned trend is related to fact that g25 does not develop an explosion within the simulation time .",
    "gw emission is typically strongest around the onset of the explosion ( g8.1 , g11.2 , g15 , and g27 ) , when the mass in the gain region increases considerably and aspherical motions in the post - shock region become most violent ( i.e.  reach the highest velocities ) before being quenched again during the later phases of shock expansion .",
    "this phase is lacking in model g25 , and the strong retraction of the shock instead reduces the mass in the gain region so that the gw amplitude is strongly attenuated during the later evolution .",
    "moreover , the relatively pure @xmath24 sasi mode seen in model g25 may not be very efficient in exciting @xmath25 perturbations in the flow to which the gw amplitude is sensitive .",
    "the overall trends in the progenitor dependence suggested by the six models g8.1g27 can thus be summarized as follows : gw emission tends to become stronger with increasing mass accretion rate .",
    "in addition , both a strong shock retraction and a very rapid explosion can quench gw activity .      to characterize the spectral properties of models g8.1g27 , we show time - integrated energy spectra in figure  [ fig : spectra_progenitors ] , for which we give the median frequency @xmath26 in table  [ tab : progenitors ]",
    ". moreover , we list the dominant emission frequencies @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 around @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 after bounce to show the time - frequency evolution of the gw signals .    for the early quasi - periodic signal , which emerges as a low - frequency peak in the curves of figure  [ fig : spectra_progenitors ] , we find no significant progenitor dependence .",
    "this signal component always peaks around @xmath1 in our models .",
    "the later signal from convection and the sasi shows somewhat larger variations .",
    "the typical emission frequencies @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 vary by @xmath33 , and tend to be highest for model g25 . considering that we cover a very wide range in pns masses from @xmath34 ( g9.6 , g11.2 ) to @xmath35 ( g25 ) , this variation may seem astonishingly small . this can be understood as a partial cancellation of terms in equation  ( [ eq : frequency_formula ] ) for the dominant emission frequency :",
    "@xmath36 while the surface gravity @xmath37 is systematically larger for more massive and compact neutron stars , the proto - neutron star surface temperature is also higher , and the general relativistic correction term @xmath38 is smaller .",
    "the remaining net change is typically moderate , as illustrated by g11.2 and g25 as rather extreme examples in figure  [ fig : progenitor_dependence ] : although the surface gravity is higher by up to @xmath39 in model g25 , @xmath40 is only lower only by @xmath41 in model g11.2 . among the less massive proto - neutron stars",
    "( models g8.1 , g11.2 , g15 ) , the differences are far less pronounced .",
    "the variation between progenitors is similar to that found by @xcite , although the absolute values for the frequencies are very different ( since @xcite lacked self - consistent neutrino transport and gr in their simulations , and used different progenitors as well as a different eos ) .",
    "when we consider time - integrated gw energy spectra ( figure  [ fig : spectra_progenitors ] ) , the relation between pns and gw properties becomes more complicated , however .",
    "we observe the highest median frequency of @xmath42 for model g11.2 , while we find relatively low values between @xmath43 and @xmath44 for g25 and g27 , although these two models have higher values for @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",
    "this reversal occurs because much of the gravitational wave emission in g11.2 happens after the onset of the explosion in late - time bursts ( see section  [ sec : bursts ] ) .",
    "gw waves with relatively high frequencies therefore contribute more strongly to the spectrum than in models such as g25 and g27 .",
    "these late - time bursts are distinctly visible as a peak around @xmath45 for g11.2 in figure  [ fig : spectra_comparison ] . for model g15 ,",
    "the situation is somewhat similar , because the bulk of gw emission occurs around @xmath46 due to the rather late explosion .",
    "model g9.6 constitutes another extreme because the high - frequency component of the spectrum is largely absent , resulting in a low median frequency of @xmath47 .",
    "our results demonstrate that time - integrated spectra are the result of a somewhat complicated interplay between the time of strongest gw emission and the time - dependence of the dominant emission frequency .",
    "this implies that time - integrated spectra are even more difficult to relate to pns properties than @xmath40 ( cp .  section  [ sec : f_peak ] ) .",
    "based on several recent two - dimensional relativistic explosion models @xcite for non - rotating progenitors between @xmath3 and @xmath4 , we studied the gw signal of core - collapse supernovae from the early post - bounce phase well into the explosion phase .",
    "we not only provided gravitational waveforms from gr hydrodynamics simulations with sophisticated multi - group neutrino transport for the first time , but also analyzed the impact of the gr treatment ( gr vs.  effective potential approach vs. newtonian approximation ) and of the neutrino physics input on the gw signal by means of three complementary ( non - exploding ) simulations of the @xmath6 progenitor .    in all phases",
    ", we found that gr has a sizable impact on the gw spectrum .",
    "for purely newtonian models , we found that the typical gw frequency during the phase of hot - bubble convection is severely underestimated ( by @xmath48 ) compared to the gr case , while it tends to be overestimated by @xmath49 in the effective potential approach .",
    "we determined that this is the results of _ systematic _ differences of the buoyancy frequency in the proto - neutron star surface region ( which approximates the typical gw frequency as pointed out by @xcite ) . in the newtonian approximation , the smaller compactness and surface gravity of the neutron star lead to a lower buoyancy frequency compared to gr , while the effective relativistic potential approach fails to correctly reproduce the frequency of oscillations in the proto - neutron star surface because of missing relativistic correction terms in the equations of hydrodynamics .",
    "similarly large differences as for the phase of hot - bubble convection were also seen for the quasi - periodic signal produced by prompt convection and early sasi activity .    apart from systematic gr effects , we observed novel features in the gw signal during the explosion phase for the @xmath15 progenitor , a model that is likely to represents a fallback supernova . here",
    "the fallback of material onto the proto - neutron star through newly - forming downflows in the explosion phase leads to a strong excitation of surface g - mode oscillations , which produce burst - like gw signals that are sharply defined in frequency space .",
    "these late - time bursts are correlated with small bursts of enhanced @xmath50 and @xmath51 emission .",
    "contrary to what more energetic explosion models @xcite might suggest , strong gw emission in the high - frequency band late in the explosion phase appears to be possible for underenergetic supernovae . in all other respects , however , our models qualitatively confirm the four - phase picture of gravitational emission with an early quasi - periodic signal , a quiescent phase of several tens of milliseconds , a strong stochastic gw signal lasting until some fraction of a second after the onset of the explosion , and a low - frequency tail - signal from anisotropic neutrino emission and shock expansion .",
    "our simulations also revealed trends for the progenitor dependence of the gw signal .",
    "we found a variation of the maximum signal amplitude by more than an order of magnitude between our two extreme cases with @xmath11 and @xmath4 .",
    "in general , high mass accretion rates turn out to be conducive to strong gw activity provided that an explosion still develops .",
    "the time - dependent dominant emission frequency varies by @xmath52 with a tendency towards higher values for more massive proto - neutron stars .",
    "the explosion dynamics plays a major role for determining the time - integrated spectrum , which is therefore more difficult to relate to pns properties .",
    "while the gw signal predictions presented here rely on state - of - the - art 2d supernova simulations with sophisticated neutrino transport , further research into the gravitational wave signals clearly remains a priority in core - collapse supernova studies .",
    "model uncertainties , e.g. concerning the nuclear equation of state , the progenitor structure , or the role of 3d effects , need to be eliminated in order to predict precise amplitudes and frequencies for specific stellar progenitors .",
    "in particular , 3d modeling will be essential for determining the correct signal amplitudes for both the plus and cross polarization modes ( the latter of which is not present in our models due to the assumption of axisymmetry ) simply because the energy contained in aspherical motions will be distributed differently among more available modes than in 2d .",
    "if 3d effects change the overall dynamics of the accretion and explosion phase considerably , e.g.  by allowing faster and more energetic explosions , this will also have a direct impact on the gw emission and may modify the details of the progenitor dependence .",
    "however , the present controversy about the role of 3d effects ( @xcite ; see @xcite for an overview discussion ) precludes any premature statement .",
    "different from the case of the gw amplitudes , we do not expect that 3d effects will change the frequency structure of the gw signal considerably .    at any rate ,",
    "our findings clearly demonstrate that a proper treatment of gr is indispensable for obtaining accurate predictions of gravitational waveforms and spectra .",
    "in particular , gr simulations will be required to link the gw signal to the properties of the nuclear equation of state , or of the progenitor . however , as a cautionary remark , we emphasize that the inclusion of gr effects at the expense of detailed multi - group neutrino transport may potentially yield little gain in our opinion .",
    "although the simplifications of the neutrino rates considered as test case in this paper cause a significant difference only for the early quasi - periodic signal , more radical approximations in the neutrino transport sector may significantly affect the contraction , the compactness . and the surface stratification of the neutron star , and might thus severely alter the gw spectra .",
    "for quantitative predictions of gw signals , future 3d simulations of core - collapse supernovae will thus have to include both gr ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) and reliable neutrino transport .",

    "although the standard newtonian quadrupole formula for the matter signal and its time - integrated varieties @xcite as used in the coconut code so far @xcite has proved reasonably accurate ( i.e.  on a level of @xmath53 ) even for relatively strong gravitational fields in comparison with more sophisticated direct wave extraction methods @xcite , it suffers from several drawbacks : its application in the context of general relativistic hydrodynamics simulation is beset with a number of ambiguities concerning the proper generalization of the source density @xmath54 .",
    "moreover , the transformation of the second time derivative of the mass quadrupole moment to a numerically more tractable form ( time - integrated quadrupole formula , stress formula ) that does not introduce excessive numerical noise becomes less straightforward than in the newtonian limit .",
    "these problems can give rise to certain pathologies in the computed gravitational wave signals such as spurious offsets ( cp .",
    "appendix  a in @xcite ) , most notably ( but not exclusively ) with the newtonian stress formula .    evolving the full space - time metric and using direct extraction",
    "would be an obvious solution to the problem , but this would not only require that we sacrifice the stable xcfc formulation of the metric , but introduce other difficulties as well : direct extraction methods can be expected to be very vulnerable to numerical noise as the gravitational wave signal from core - collapse supernovae is weak in the sense that it carries away only a minuscule fraction of the total mass of the system .",
    "post - newtonian generalizations of the quadrupole formula @xcite provide another possible workaround , but tend to be considerably more cumbersome than the standard quadrupole formula .",
    "for the extraction of gravitational waves from our core - collapse supernova simulations , we prefer a somewhat simpler solution that still meets the following requirements :    * no higher time derivatives are required for extracting the wave signal . *",
    "the gravitational wave amplitude vanishes for a stationary flow . *",
    "the generalization of the quadrupole formula should ( and need only ) be valid for the conditions typically encountered in core - collapse supernova simulations .    due to the restriction to the supernova context , several approximations can be made : concerning the matter sources , we assume all velocities to be sufficiently small to disregard retardation effects . concerning the space - time metric , we consider only small perturbations on the background of a cfc metric @xmath55 , which is given in terms of the lapse function @xmath56 , the shift vector @xmath57 , the conformal factor @xmath58 , and the flat - space three metric @xmath59 as @xmath60 for deriving our modified quadrupole formula , we use cartesian spatial coordinates so that @xmath61 , and only convert to spherical polar coordinates to obtain the final formulae ( equations [ eq : final_stress_formula ] and [ eq : relativistic_tqf ] ) .",
    "we also assume that the space - time is almost stationary with vanishing shift , @xmath62 furthermore , we observe empirically that for the typical field strength reached in the proto - neutron star environment , the lapse function and the conformal factor obey the relation @xmath63 which is a direct consequence of the fact that the field strength is moderate and that the eulerian energy density @xmath64 is the dominating source term in both the non - linear poisson equations for @xmath65 and @xmath58 ( cp .",
    "paper  i ) .    with these approximations for the space - time metric",
    ", it can easily be verified that the harmonic gauge condition @xmath66 is satisfied .",
    "we can therefore use the relaxed field equations @xcite to compute gravitational amplitudes perturbatively on the background of the cfc metric .",
    "the relaxed field equations in geometrized units read @xmath67 with @xmath68 , @xmath69 . here , @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the stress - energy tensor of the matter and the landau - lifschitz pseudo - tensor for the gravitational field , respectively , and @xmath72 is a non - linear differential operator . for our derivation of a modified quadrupole formula , it is convenient to follow @xcite and to introduce @xmath73 ( where @xmath74 is the flat - space minkowski metric ) .",
    "the relaxed field equations are amenable to an iterative solution by means of the green s function method , i.e.  solutions for @xmath75 can be obtained @xcite by successively computing @xmath76 and updating the source @xmath77 in the process . in general , this procedure is beset with a number of difficulties ( such as the treatment of non - compact sources and the occurrence of divergences in higher - order approximations ) , but it can readily be used to obtain an estimate for the gravitational wave amplitude for the matter signal in our case : as in the usual derivation of the newtonian quadrupole formula , we assume that the source is small compared to the wavelength and that retardation effects can be neglected , in which case equation  ( [ eq : green_1 ] ) can be written as ) , equation  ( [ eq : green_2 ] ) can no longer be used to compute the gravitational wave signal due to anisotropic neutrino emission , which must include retardation effects as neutrinos propagate with the same velocity as the gravitational waves themselves . ] @xmath78 by projecting @xmath79 onto the subspace of symmetric transverse - traceless ( stt ) tensors , one obtains the angle - dependent gravitational wave amplitude , which can then be decomposed into pure - spin tensor harmonics @xcite of degree @xmath25 .",
    "these are already completely determined by the purely spatial components @xmath80 .    at this point ,",
    "the complicated metric - dependent terms in @xmath81 are the major obstacle for formulating a simple integral expression for the gravitational wave amplitude .",
    "however , using the fact that @xmath81 is divergence - free ( @xmath82 ) , the integral in equation  ( [ eq : green_2 ] ) can be transformed into an integral over @xmath83 or @xmath84 at the cost of introducing time derivatives : @xmath85 the formula for @xmath80 containing the time derivative of @xmath83 is particularly useful because it does not contain purely gravitational contributions due to our assumptions for the metric functions , and can therefore be expressed in terms of the covariant eulerian three - momentum density @xmath86 ( with @xmath87 and @xmath88 being the relativistic specficic enthalpy including rest mass contributions and the lorenz factor , respectively ) as @xmath89 which is exactly the conserved quantity in our formulation of the equations of hydrodynamics @xcite .",

    "while formula ( [ eq : basic_tqf ] ) for @xmath80 is already amenable to a numerical treatment ( no time derivatives are required ) , it can be cast into a form corresponding more closely to the newtonian stress formula .",
