    "dijet production in hadronic collisions is one of the golden channels to study perturbative qcd and hadron physics in high energy experiments . in dijet events ,",
    "the two jets are produced mainly in the back - to - back configuration in the transverse plane , @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 represent the two incoming hadrons with momenta @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively , the azimuthal angle between the two jets is defined as @xmath5 with @xmath6 being the azimuthal angles of the two jets .",
    "there have been comprehensive analyses of the azimuthal angular correlation ( or decorrelation ) in dijet events produced at hadron colliders  @xcite . in the leading order",
    "naive parton picture , the born diagram contributes to a delta function at @xmath7 .",
    "one gluon radiation will lead to a singular distribution around @xmath7 , which will persist at even higher orders  @xcite .",
    "this divergence arises when the total transverse momentum of dijet ( imbalance ) is much smaller than the individual jet momentum , @xmath8 , where large logarithms appear in every order of perturbative calculations .",
    "these large logs are normally referred as the sudakov logarithms , @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , a qcd resummation has to be included in order to have a reliable theoretical prediction .",
    "the goal of this paper is to derive the resummation formulas for dijet production in the kinematics of these large logarithms .",
    "a brief summary of our results has been published in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the kinematics region @xmath10 ,",
    "the appropriate resummation method to apply is the so - called transverse momentum dependent ( tmd ) resummation or the collins - soper - sterman ( css ) resummation  @xcite .",
    "the css resummation was derived for the massive neutral particle production in hadronic collisions , such as the electroweak boson ( or higgs boson ) production .",
    "however , due to the presence of the colored final state , the resummation of dijet production will be much more complicated .",
    "there have been theoretical progressed in the leading double logarithmic approximation ( lla ) , where it was found that each incoming parton contributes half of its color charge to sudakov resummation factor  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will go beyond the lla to perform the resummation calculation at the next - to - leading logarithm ( nll ) level .",
    "the threshold resummation for dijet production in hadronic collisions has been investigated in a series of publications by sterman and his collaborators  @xcite .",
    "the methodology of our calculations for the tmd resummation is very similar to those studies .",
    "we will start our derivation by evaluating the differential cross sections as a function of the imbalance transverse momentum @xmath11 at the complete one - loop order .",
    "the leading order contribution is a delta function @xmath12 .",
    "one - loop corrections come from four contributions : ( a ) virtual contributions ; ( b ) soft gluon radiation ( real ) ; ( c ) jet contributions ; ( d ) collinear gluon radiation associated with the incoming parton distributions .",
    "the virtual graphs have been studied in the literature  @xcite .",
    "the jet contributions are easy to derive following the examples of inclusive jet production . in order to calculate the analytical results",
    ", we will adopt the narrow jet approximation ( nja )  @xcite , where explicit dependence on jet sizes @xmath13 and @xmath14 can be evaluated .",
    "the soft gluon ( real ) contribution is most difficult to calculate .",
    "this is because , not all soft gluon radiation contributes to the finite @xmath11 .",
    "the radiation inside the jet will be part of the jet contribution at one - loop order and has to be excluded from soft gluon radiation contribution . in our calculations",
    ", we will apply a small offshellness for the jets in the final state to calculate the soft gluon radiation .",
    "we find that this method yield the exact same results as that using kinematic cut - off to regulate soft gluon radiation in the nja .",
    "collinear gluon radiation associated with incoming parton distributions also contribute to the finite imbalance transverse momentum .",
    "this part can be formulated according to the well - known dglap splitting . in the end , for finite and soft imbalance transverse momentum @xmath11",
    ", we add the soft gluon ( real ) and collinear gluon ( real ) contributions together , which leads to the so - called asymptotic behavior for the differential cross sections at low imbalance transverse momentum @xmath11 .",
    "an important cross check of our derivation is to compare its numerical results with the dijet production codes available in public .",
    "we will carry out these comparisons in this paper .",
    "another cross check is to demonstrate the soft divergences cancellation between real and virtual graphs .",
    "we will show these cancellations in details for the hard partonic channels in our calculations .",
    "after the cancellation , we are left with only collinear divergences associated incoming parton distributions .",
    "this indicates that we do have a consistent results for dijet production at one - loop calculations .",
    "the large logarithms mentioned above will be evident from the complete one - loop results .",
    "resummation of these large logarithms is the main goal of current paper . to perform the resummation ,",
    "we first show that the differential cross sections at one - loop order can be factorized into the transverse momentum distributions , soft factor , and hard factors , respectively .",
    "the transverse momentum distributions follow the definitions for drell - yan or higgs boson production at low transverse momentum .",
    "the soft factor will have to take into account the additional effect of gluon radiation associated with the two final state jets .",
    "the idea to construct the soft factor follows the examples of threshold resummation studied by sterman et al .",

    "the hard and soft factors @xmath31 and @xmath32 are expressed as matrices in the color space of partonic channel @xmath22 , and @xmath33 are the associated anomalous dimensions for the soft factor ( defined below ) . the sudakov form factor @xmath34 resums the leading double logarithms and the universal sub - leading logarithms , @xmath35\\ , \\label{su}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 represent the cone sizes for the two jets , respectively . here the parameters @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 can be expanded perturbatively in @xmath39 . at one - loop order , @xmath40 , @xmath41 for gluon - gluon initial state , @xmath42 , @xmath43 for quark - quark initial state , and @xmath44 , @xmath45 for gluon - quark initial state . here , @xmath46 , with @xmath47 being the number of effective light quarks .",

    "the cone size @xmath50 is introduced to regulate the collinear gluon radiation associated with the final state jets .",
    "only the soft gluon radiation outside the jet cone will contribute to the imbalance @xmath11 between the two jets .",
    "there are two important issues we will not addressed in much details .",
    "first , our resummation formalism is based on a tmd factorization argument  @xcite . however , there is a potential contribution at order of @xmath51 which violates the general tmd factorization  @xcite .",
    "it was found , in particular , certain diagrams in dijet production in hadronic collisions can not be factorized into the simple universal tmds . in terms of resummation coefficients",
    ", this will affect the coefficient @xmath52 in eq .",
    "( [ su ] ) . in our numeric calculations",
    ", we will include both @xmath53 and @xmath54 coefficients in the resummation formula ( see detailed discussions in sec .",
    "though we do not expect that the factorization violating effect will affect much the results to be presented below , it will be useful to estimate the size of factorization breaking effect in some future work .",
    "second , we derive our results , in both collinear and tmd approaches , by adopting the narrow jet approximation . with that , we are able to demonstrate the explicit cancellation of soft divergences from various parts of analytical calculation , and to express the resummation sudakov form factor in an analytic form in terms of the jet sizes . although the derivation itself is not limited to nja , we find that the differential cross section expressions are much simplified under the nja .",
    "how to extend our results to the case without nja is very interesting subject .",
    "it is worthwhile to come back to this question in the future .",
    "however , in current paper , we will carry out our calculations with the nja .",

    "this includes virtual graph contributions , jet contributions in the real gluon radiation , collinear gluon radiation associated with the incoming partons , and the soft gluon radiation which contributes to finite @xmath11 . since the soft gluon radiation is the most important contributions for dijet production , we dedicate sec .",
    "iv to show the details of our calculations . in sec .",
    "v , we compare the asymptotic results for dijet production to the fixed order calculation published in the literature . the asymptotic behavior for dijet production is calculated by summing the soft gluon radiation and collinear gluon radiation derived in secs .",

    "dijet production at the leading order can be calculated from partonic @xmath56 processes , @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are momenta for incoming and outgoing two partons .",
    "schematically , we draw the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ dijet0 ] .     and",
    "@xmath60 , and outgoing momenta : @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively.,width=226 ]    the partonic channels include the following subprocesses : @xmath63 their contributions can be summarized as @xmath64 where the overall normalization of the differential cross section is @xmath65 .",
    "the partonic cross sections @xmath66 for all the production channels are listed below .",
    "@xmath67 where the kinematic variables @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "as mentioned above , at the leading order , they contribute to a delta function of @xmath11 , which corresponds to the back - to - back configuration of the two jets in the transverse plane .",

    "the computation is performed in the @xmath71-space , the fourier transformed conjugate parameter to the transverse momentum @xmath11 .",
    "that is to say , we will calculate @xmath55 at the one - loop order .",
    ".,width=453 ]    there are four types of radiative contributions at the one - loop order :    1 .   virtual contributions , as shown in fig .",
    "[ dijetv](a ) .",
    "these contributions have been calculated in the literature , and they are proportional to the leading order contributions , leading to a delta function of @xmath11 .",
    "2 .   real gluon radiation : jet contributions . in the real gluon radiation ,",
    "one particular contribution is also proportional to the leading order contribution , that is the jet contribution . in this case , the gluon radiation is within the jet , where its momentum is collinear to the final state parton .",
    "for example , as shown fig .",
    "[ dijetv](b ) , the radiated gluon is collinear to one of the final state parton , and they form a new jet at one - loop order . because of momentum conservation , this again leads to a delta function of @xmath11 .",
    "3 .   real gluon radiation : collinear gluon associated with incoming partons .",
    "these collinear gluons contribute to a finite @xmath11 , and is proportional to @xmath74 multiplied by the splitting kernel of parton distribution functions .",
    "since they originate from the incident partons , the collinear gluon contributions follow the generic structure and are easy to calculate .",
    "4 .   real gluon radiation : soft gluon contribution .",
    "soft gluon contributions are more difficult to evaluate .",
    "they also contribute to a finite @xmath11 .",
    "to evaluate this part of contribution , we apply the leading power expansion in the limit of @xmath75 . however , because the final state jets also carry color , the soft gluon radiation has to take into account the interactions among initial and final state partons .",
    "in addition , we have to exclude the soft gluon radiation within the final state ( cone ) jets whose contributions have already been included in the final state jet contributions .",
    "detailed calculations will be presented in the following section .    in the rest of this section",
    ", we will go through the first three kinds of contributions , whereas the soft gluon radiation contribution will be calculated in sec .",
    "iv .    we will carry out our calculations in the collinear factorization formalism , and apply the dimensional regulation for ir and uv divergences with dimension @xmath76 .",
    "various divergences appear in individual contributions : @xmath77 represents the soft divergence , whereas @xmath78 for either soft or collinear divergence .",
    "since we are dealing with jet production in the final states , we will also encounter the divergences associated with the jet size @xmath50 .",
    "the explicit calculations of gluon radiation will depend on how we define the jet , i.e. , the jet algorithm will play a role in formulating the one - loop corrections .",
    "two important cross checks will be performed in the derivations .",
    "first , the soft divergences of @xmath77 will be cancelled out completely among different terms .",
    "we notice that ( 1,2,4 ) terms listed above will have @xmath77 contributions .",
    "a crucial test of our calculations is that these @xmath77 cancel out each other .",
    "this cancellation is not trivial , since they come from different diagrams , and some with different color factors .",
    "however , we will show that the total contribution is free of soft divergence of @xmath77 .",
    "second , the divergences associated with the final state jets are also cancelled out among various terms .",
    "the collinear divergences associated with the jets are regulated by the jet sizes , and the individual contributions contain terms of @xmath79 are cancelled out in the final results .",
    "we will show that the cancellation indeed happens at this order .",
    "virtual diagrams for dijet production in hadronic collisions have been calculated in the classic paper of ref .",
    "@xcite . in our calculations",
    ", we will take their results .",
    "jet contributions contain the collinear gluon radiation and gluon to quark - antiquark splitting in the final state .",
    "the schematic diagrams have been shown in figs .  [",
    "dijetv](b ) and ( c ) . because we have two jets in the final state",
    ", one - loop jet corrections can come from either of the jets , as shown in fig .",
    "[ dijetv](b ) and ( c ) , respectively .",
    "the jet contribution needs to be included to capture the collinear gluon radiation ( or gluon splitting to quark - antiquark pair ) within the jet cone .",
    "these gluon radiations will not change the kinematics of the parenting parton , and therefore contribute to a delta function of @xmath11 , which is similar to the virtual graph contributions .",
    "the requirement is that the two partons in the splitting process form a jet according to the jet algorithm adopted in experimental measurements . in order to derive an analytic expression with the jet cone size dependence to demonstrate the cancellations in the final results and to derive the resummation formula ,",
    "we apply the narrow jet approximation ( nja ) in our calculations . in particular , we follow the technique and scheme of the subtraction developed in refs .",
    "the basic idea is to note that in the collinear gluon radiation limit for each final state jet , @xmath80 where @xmath81 represents the scattering amplitude of @xmath82 subprocess , @xmath83 for the leading order @xmath56 subprocess with one of the final state parton branching into two parton final state represented by the splitting of @xmath84 .",
    "therefore , the jet contributions can be summarized as , @xmath85 where the factor @xmath86 accounts for the phase space difference from 3 parton final state to 2 parton final state .",

    "we would like to emphasize that the singular terms ( double and single poles ) are independent of jet algorithm .",
    "the jet algorithm dependent contributions arise from the finite term @xmath98 .",

    "the dominant contribution at this order is illustrated in the right panel , which are factorizable and come from @xmath53 in the resummation formula.,width=340 ]    to evaluate the contribution from soft gluon radiation requires more care .",
    "this is because we have to exclude the collinear contributions associated with the final state jet which will be factorized into a jet function and will not contribute to finite @xmath11 . before we discuss its details in the following section",
    ", we note that the tmd factorization breaking effects can appear at higher orders in two particle production at hadron colliders  @xcite .",

    "[ factorizationbreak ]  @xcite , which belong to a nontrivial contribution at order @xmath51 to the parton distributions .",

    "this analysis has been applied in ref .",
    "@xcite to obtain the leading double logarithmic contributions to dijet production . in the current paper",
    ", we will extend that analysis to include the subleading logarithmic contributions as well .",
    "in particular , we will derive the contributions which depend on the jet cone sizes .",
    "the relevant feynman rules have been listed in ref .  @xcite . for completeness , we copy these results here . for outgoing quark , antiquark and gluon lines , we have @xmath106 respectively , where @xmath107 represents the momentum of the outgoing particles . for incoming quark , antiquark and gluon lines , we have , @xmath108 respectively , where @xmath109 represents the momentum for the incoming particle .    following ref .",
    "@xcite , we choose the physical polarization for the soft gluon along the incoming particle @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , the soft gluon radiation from the incoming particle @xmath60 vanishes with this polarization choice . from that",

    "to avoid double - counting , we have to subtract this part of contribution .",
    "that means the phase space integral has to exclude the jet ( cone ) region .",
    "it is interesting to note that the amount of this exclusion does not depend on jet algorithm .",
    "this is because , here we are considering the soft gluon radiation , whereas the jet algorithm mainly focuses on the collinear gluons associated with the jet .      as a general discussion ,",
    "let us take the example of one term , @xmath124 where @xmath125 represents the transverse momentum for the final state jet , and @xmath126 .",
    "clearly , there is collinear divergence associated with the jet .",
    "that means , if the gluon radiation is within the jet cone , it will generate a collinear divergence . in order to regulate this collinear jet divergence ,",
    "we can limit the phase space integral to require that the gluon radiation being outside of the jet cone . with this restriction",
    ", there will be no divergence associated with the jet . instead",
    ", the jet ( cone ) size @xmath50 will be introduced to regulate the collinear divergence from the jet .",
    "there are different ways to regulate the above integral .",
    "the main task is to identify the need of introducing jet ( cone ) size . in the above example",
    ", the integral diverges when @xmath127 is parallel to @xmath61 , where the invariant mass of @xmath128 becomes small .",
    "the out of cone radiation requires that the invariant mass has a minimum , say , @xmath129 , i.e. , @xmath130 clearly , @xmath129 depends on the jet size . in other words ,",
    "if @xmath131 is smaller than @xmath132 , we have to exclude its contribution , because it belongs to the jet contribution calculated in previous section .",
    "following the similar analysis as done for the jet contribution , we can find out the size of @xmath129 .",
    "for example , if we substitute the kinematics of @xmath61 and @xmath127 into the above equation , we will obtain @xmath133 where @xmath19 and @xmath134 are rapidities for @xmath61 and @xmath127 , @xmath135 and @xmath136 are the azimuthal angles , respectively , and @xmath137 represents the cone size between @xmath61 and @xmath127 . in other words ,",
    "if @xmath137 is smaller than @xmath50 , the gluon radiation will be considered inside the jet cone .",
    "therefore , in the phase space integral of eq .",
    "( [ es1 ] ) , we have to impose the following kinematic restriction : @xmath138 with @xmath139 .",
    "equivalently , we find it is much easier to adapt a slight off - shell - ness for the jet momentum @xmath61 to regulate the divergence : @xmath140 . by doing that we do not need to impose any kinematic constraints , and",
    "the phase space integral is much easier to carry out .",
    "the choice of @xmath141 is to make sure that @xmath131 is always larger than @xmath132 .",
    "this can be verified as follows , @xmath142 by choosing @xmath143 , it is guaranteed that @xmath131 is larger than @xmath132 for any values of @xmath90 and @xmath91 .    in the narrow jet approximation ,",
    "i.e. , in the @xmath144 limit , the phase space cut - off technique results into the same leading contributions in terms of @xmath145 . after adding an off - shell - ness to the jet momentum , the integral in eq .",
    "( [ es1 ] ) can be written as @xmath146 to proceed , we average the azimuthal angle of the jet but fix the azimuthal angle of @xmath147 .",

    "the results have been cross checked through various perspectives , and they are consistent within the theoretical framework our calculations are built on .",
    "these cross checks are nontrivial supports for the factorization arguments used in our derivations .",
    "a number of extensions can be performed along this direction .",
    "for example , we shall be able to calculate the soft gluon resummation effects in the vector boson ( or higgs boson ) plus a high @xmath21 jet production at the colliders where the total transverse momentum of the boson and the jet is much smaller than the invariant mass of the final state particles  @xcite .",
    "these processes are important channels to study the standard model physics at the lhc .",
    "finally , we would like to comment on the applications of our results to the dijet production with large rapidity separation .",
    "this particular kinematics is very interesting to study the qcd resummation physics .",
    "it has long been realized that the so - called bfkl resummation @xcite will be important in this kinematics , which is referred as the mueller - navelet dijet production  @xcite . in particular , recently , the cms collaboration at the lhc has measured the dijet azimuthal correlation with large rapidity separation between the jets , which has been interpreted as the bfkl resummation effects  @xcite . however , in this calculation , only bfkl - type resummation has been taken into account .",
    "we would like to argue that there should be sudakov resummation as well .",
    "theoretically , how to resum large logarithms from both types of physics effects is an important question",
    ". we will not address it in this paper .",
    "instead , we will discuss below the physics of our resummation formula when considered in this kinematics .",
    "when the two jets are produced with large rapidity separation , we are in a special kinematic region , where the physics is dominated by @xmath467-channel diagrams .",
    "therefore , we can apply the following kinematic approximations , @xmath468 , which also implies that @xmath469 .",
    "more importantly , all the partonic channels with @xmath467-channel gluon exchange will be the most important contributions .",
    "this is because they all have terms which are proportional to @xmath470 .",
    "this includes the following channels : @xmath471 , @xmath193 , and @xmath218 .",
    "in addition , by applying the above approximation , we find out that the anomalous dimensions for the associated soft factors derived in the last section become diagonalized .",
    "the direct consequence is that we can simplify the final resummation formula , by absorbing the soft factor anomalous dimension of eq .",
    "( [ resumf ] ) into the overall sudakov perturbative form factor of eq .",
    "( [ suf ] ) . this much simplified result ,",
    "as compared to that presented in the last section , may indicate a consistent resummation formula for the mueller - navelet dijet production .",
    "the remaining task is to develop a consistent theoretical framework to include both physics effects induced by the bfkl and sudakov resummation dynamics  @xcite .",
