    "the multiple zeta values ( abbreviated as mzvs ) is a real number defined by the convergent series @xmath0 for positive integers @xmath1 with @xmath2 .",
    "it is known that many @xmath3-linear relations hold among mzvs .",
    "moreover , mzvs have the so - called double shuffle product rule , which deepens the theory of mzvs .",
    "let @xmath4 . as a generalization of the sum formula @xcite , the restricted sum formula @xmath5 for mzvs is proved in @xcite .",
    "the derivation relation , which is described in the next section , is proved in @xcite by reducing it to the regularized double shuffle relation . in @xcite , the derivation relation ( and its certain extension )",
    "is proved as a part of kawashima relation @xcite . in this paper",
    "we show the derivation relation implies the restricted sum formula .",
    "detailed statement is given in the next section .",
    "first the restricted sum formula and the derivation relation for mzvs are given in terms of the algebraic setup introduced in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath6 denote the noncommutative polynomial algebra over the rational numbers in two indeterminates @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and let @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote the subalgebras @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .",

    "the map @xmath25 is a @xmath26-homomorphism , _ i.e. _ @xmath27 for @xmath28 .",
    "this is called the shuffle product formula for mzvs .",
    "the restricted sum formula is then stated , for @xmath4 , as @xmath29    a derivation @xmath30 on @xmath31 is a @xmath3-linear endomorphism of @xmath31 satisfying the leibniz rule @xmath32 such a derivation is uniquely determined by its images of generators @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath33 . for each @xmath34 , the derivation @xmath35 is defined by @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "it follows immediately that @xmath38 .",

    "[ main ] the restricted sum formula is written as a linear combination of the derivation relation .",
    "that is , for @xmath4 , we have @xmath41    it is known that the derivation relation is contained in ohno s relation @xcite .",
    "( see @xcite . )",
    "hence the theorem asserts that the restricted sum formula is also contained in ohno s relation .",
    "let @xmath42 for @xmath43 . the harmonic product @xmath44 is the @xmath3-bilinear map defined by @xmath45 for @xmath46 and the recursive rule @xmath47 for @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",

    "( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 6 ) for details . )",
    "we also define the map @xmath80 by @xmath81 .",
