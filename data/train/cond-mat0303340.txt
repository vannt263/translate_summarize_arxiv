    "since forty years , it is the hubbard or the extended hubbard models that are most frequently studied when properties of strongly correlated electrons are to be investigated .",
    "the central issue is the phase diagram of these models . despite the apparent simplicity of both models and concerted efforts of many researchers ,",
    "the complicated structure of these phase diagrams , even at zero temperature , has not been revealed completely and unquestionably ; rigorous results are scarce .",
    "a few years ago nakamura @xcite predicted a new kind of quantum phase transition in the ground state of a half - filled extended hubbard model chain . on a line , in the space of the two relevant interaction parameters ( representing on - site and nearest - neighbor ( n.n . ) repulsion due to coulomb forces , expressed in the units of the hopping intensity ) , for large values of these parameters , the system is in the phase - separated state , which is a mixture of a charge - density - wave phase and a spin - density - wave phase .",
    "the transition occurs when the parameters are decreased along the line , at a critical point where the parameters assume intermediate values ( of the order of one ) .",
    "thus , the transition region is hardly accessible by perturbation methods . a new state exhibits a long - range order , the so called bond - order - wave .",
    "there are many aspects of the phase diagram to be studied in connection with the new conjectured transition , and they are vigorously discussed in the physics literature recently @xcite . in this paper",
    "we address just one aspect of the new transition that we find remarkable .",
    "namely , by increasing the hopping intensity of electrons the system is driven from a phase - separated state to a crystalline state with a long - range order .",
    "our aim is to construct a model of interacting electrons ( by the way we consider an analogous model of interacting hard - core bosons ) , where the existence of a transition exhibiting this feature can be demonstrated rigorously .",
    "the model to be studied is a simplified version of the one band , spin @xmath0 hubbard model , known as the static approximation ( one sort of electrons hops while the other sort is immobile ) , with the hamiltonian @xmath1 , extended by a next - nearest - neighbor ( n.n.n . ) attractive interaction between the immobile particles , given by the hamiltonian @xmath2 .",
    "thus the total hamiltonian of the system reads :    @xmath3    in the above formulae , the underlying lattice is a square lattice , denoted @xmath4 , consisting of sites @xmath5 whose number is @xmath6 , having the shape of a @xmath7 torus . in ( [ hfk],[v ] ) and below",
    ", the sums @xmath8 , @xmath9 , stand for the summation over all the @xmath10-th n.n .",
    "pairs of lattice sites , with each pair counted once .",
    "the subsystem of mobile spinless electrons is described in terms of creation and annihilation operators of an electron at site @xmath11 : @xmath12 , @xmath13 , respectively , satisfying the canonical anticommutation relations , with @xmath14 being the n.n . hopping intensity . the total electron - number operator is @xmath15 , and ( with a little abuse of notation ) the corresponding electron density is @xmath16 .",
    "the subsystem of ions is described by a collection of pseudo - spins @xmath17 , with @xmath18 ( @xmath19 if the site @xmath11 is occupied by an ion and @xmath20 if it is empty ) , called the _",
    "ion configurations_. the total number of ions is @xmath21 and the ion density is @xmath22 . in contradistinction to the electron subsystem , the ions interact directly : two ions that occupy two n.n.n .",
    "sites attract each other , contributing the energy @xmath23 , with @xmath24 .",
    "clearly , in the composite system , whose hamiltonian is given by ( [ h0 ] ) , with arbitrary electron - ion coupling @xmath25 , the particle - number operators @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and pseudo - spins @xmath28 , are conserved .",
    "therefore the description of the classical subsystem in terms of the ion configurations @xmath29 remains valid .",
    "whenever periodic configurations of pseudo - spins are considered it is assumed that @xmath4 is sufficiently large , so that it accommodates an integer number of elementary cells .",
    "nowadays , @xmath1 is widely known as the hamiltonian of the spinless falicov  kimball model , a simplified version of the hamiltonian put forward in @xcite .",
    "a lot of results , including rigorous ones , like a proof of the existence of a phase transition @xcite for instance , have been obtained for the system described by this hamiltonian ( a review and an extensive list of references can be found in @xcite ) .    in what follows",
    ", we shall study the ground - state phase diagram of the system defined by ( [ h0 ] ) in the grand - canonical ensemble .",
    "that is , let @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 are the chemical potentials of the electrons and ions , respectively , and let @xmath33 be the ground - state energy of @xmath34 , for a given configuration @xmath35 of the ions . then , the ground - state energy of @xmath36 , @xmath37 , is defined as @xmath38 .",
    "the minimum is attained at the set @xmath39 of the ground - state configurations of ions .",
    "we shall determine the subsets of the @xmath40-plane , where @xmath39 consists of periodic configurations of ions , uniformly in the size of the underlying square lattice .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the first subsection of the next section we provide a number of symmetry properties of the ground - state energy , @xmath41 , which facilitate the studies of the phase diagram that follow , and",
    "give the strong - coupling expansion of @xmath42 in the case of hopping fermions ( subsection 2.1 ) .",
    "then , in subsection 2.2 we construct the grand - canonical phase diagram due to the ground - state energy truncated at fourth order of the strong - coupling expansion in the case of hopping fermions ( this is sufficient to draw our conclusions ) . after that , in subsection 2.3 we consider the grand - canonical phase diagram due to the ground - state energy truncated at fourth order of the strong - coupling expansion in the case of hopping hard - core bosons .",
    "finally , in section  3 we discuss the implications of the phase diagram obtained with the truncated effective interaction , when the remainder of the strong - coupling expansion is taken into account .",
    "in studies of grand - canonical phase diagrams an important role is played by unitary transformations that exchange particles and holes : @xmath43 and @xmath44 , and for some @xmath45 leave the hamiltonian @xmath36 invariant . for the electron subsystem",
    "such a role is played by the transformations : @xmath46 , with @xmath47 at the even sublattice of @xmath4 and @xmath48 at the odd one . clearly , since @xmath49 is invariant under the joint hole ",
    "particle transformation of electrons and ions , @xmath50 is hole ",
    "particle invariant at the point @xmath51 . at the hole ",
    "particle symmetry point , the system under consideration has very special properties , which simplify studies of its phase diagram @xcite .",
    "moreover , by means of the defined above hole ",
    "particle transformations one can determine a number of symmetries of the grand - canonical phase diagram @xcite .",
    "the peculiarity of the model is that the case of attraction ( @xmath52 ) and the case of repulsion ( @xmath53 ) are related by a unitary transformation ( the hole  particle transformation for ions ) : if @xmath35 is a ground - state configuration at @xmath40 for @xmath53 , then @xmath54 is the ground - state configuration at @xmath55 for @xmath52 .",
    "consequently , without any loss of generality one can fix the sign of the coupling constant @xmath25 .",
    "moreover ( with the sign of @xmath25 fixed ) , there is the _ inversion symmetry _ of the grand - canonical phase diagram , that is , if @xmath35 is a ground - state configuration at @xmath56 , then @xmath54 is the ground - state configuration at @xmath57 .",
    "therefore , it is enough to determine the phase diagram in the half - plane specified by fixing the sign of one of the chemical potentials .",
    "additional properties emerge in the _ strong - coupling regime _",
    ", i.e. for @xmath58 @xcite . specifically , if the electron chemical potential is in the open interval @xmath59 , then for any two ion configurations @xmath35 , @xmath60 the energy difference @xmath61 is constant along the lines @xmath62 , with minus sign referring to the case of positive @xmath25 ( repulsion ) while the plus sign  to the case of negative @xmath25 ( attraction ) .",
    "this property together with the inversion symmetry implies that in the stripe @xmath63 of the @xmath64-plane it is enough to determine the phase diagram at the half - line @xmath65 , @xmath66 ( or @xmath67 ) .",
    "our aim in this paper is to investigate the ground - state phase diagram off the symmetry point . according to the state of the art ,",
    "this is feasible only in the strong - coupling regime . from now on",
    ", we shall consider exclusively the case of the strong positive coupling , i.e. @xmath68 . in this case , it is convenient to express all the parameters of @xmath36 , in the units of @xmath69 , i.e. we change @xmath70 , @xmath71 , etc , but keep the previous notation",
    ". then , @xmath49 assumes the form @xmath72 and the strong - coupling regime is given by the condition @xmath73 .",
    "the possibility of studying the phase diagram in the strong - coupling regime stems from the fact that in the open stripe @xmath74 , the ion density @xmath75 of a ground - state configuration determines the electron density : @xmath76 for @xmath52 , and @xmath77 for @xmath53 .",
    "then , one can formally expand the ground - state energy @xmath41 in powers of @xmath14 , what results in the so called effective hamiltonian : @xmath78 \\sum\\limits_{\\langle x , y \\rangle_{1 } }   s_{x}s_{y } + \\left [ \\frac{3t^{4}}{16}- \\frac{{\\tilde{\\varepsilon}}}{16 } \\right ] \\sum\\limits_{\\langle x , y \\rangle_{2 } }   s_{x}s_{y } + \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\frac{t^{4}}{8 } \\sum\\limits_{\\langle x , y \\rangle_{3 } } s_{x}s_{y } + \\frac{t^{4}}{16 } \\sum\\limits_{p } \\left(1 + 5s_{p}\\right ) + r^{(4)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] up to a term independent of the ion configuration and the chemical potentials . in ( [ expansion ] )",

    "the expansion ( [ expansion ] ) ( with @xmath86 ) was introduced and the phase diagram , according to the expansion truncated at the fourth order , was studied in @xcite .",
    "it turns out however that , in the strong - coupling regime the expansion ( [ expansion ] ) is absolutely convergent , uniformly in @xmath4 @xcite . due to this fact ,",
    "it is possible to establish rigorously a part of the phase diagram ( that is the ground states are determined everywhere in the @xmath64-plane , except some regions ) , by determining the phase diagram of the expansion truncated at the order @xmath87 , that is according to the effective hamiltonian @xmath88 .      to construct the phase diagram according to the effective hamiltonian @xmath89 , we use the @xmath90-potential method introduced in @xcite , with technical developments given in @xcite . by virtue of the comments in the preceding subsection , in what follows we set @xmath65 and @xmath91 . in the order zero",
    "the effective hamiltonian reads : @xmath92 where @xmath93 except the point @xmath94 , @xmath86 , where all the configurations have the same energy , the plaquette potentials @xmath95 are minimized by the restrictions to @xmath79 of a few periodic configurations on @xmath4 . for @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) it is the _ ferromagnetic configuration _",
    "@xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) , where @xmath100 at every site ( @xmath101 at every site ) , while at the half - line @xmath94 , @xmath102 , besides the ferromagnetic configurations @xmath98 and @xmath99 , these are the two _ antiferromagnetic ( or chessboard ) configurations _",

    "@xmath122 the number of ground - state configurations grows exponentially with the size of the underlying lattice ( like @xmath123 ) .",

    "more generally , consider a sequence of rational ion densities @xmath219 @xmath220 , @xmath221 , @xmath222 , @xmath223 , @xmath0 ( and the corresponding electron densities @xmath224 ) .",
    "then , for some densities of this sequence , depending on @xmath130 , the ground - state phases of the system are characterized by crystalline , i.e. exibiting positional long - range order , arrangements of the ions , given by the ion configurations @xmath160 , @xmath162 , @xmath163 , @xmath164 and @xmath161 , of the corresponding density . for @xmath225",
    ", we can have only two crystalline phases : @xmath160-phase and @xmath161-phase . at the half - line , given by @xmath226 and @xmath227 ,",
    "these two phases and only these two ones coexist , i.e. any @xmath35 that is not in @xmath228 has higher energy . since , @xmath229 where",
    "@xmath230 , @xmath231 , and @xmath232 are evaluated at @xmath226 , and @xmath233 stands for the common value of @xmath234 obtained for @xmath235 and @xmath226 , the coexistence of @xmath160-phase and @xmath161-phase follows from the following inequality : @xmath236 for any configuration @xmath35 and @xmath227 . in ( [ e4bound ] ) , @xmath231 and @xmath232",
    "are also evaluated at @xmath226 , @xmath237 stands for the set of the @xmath135-plaquettes such that @xmath238 does not coincide with @xmath135-plaquette configurations labelled by @xmath19 , @xmath239 , @xmath158 ( we call @xmath237 the set of _ @xmath135-plaquette excitations _ relative to the configurations in @xmath240 , @xmath241 is the cardinality of @xmath237 , and @xmath242 is a constant ( i.e. @xmath242 is independent of @xmath35 , @xmath14 , @xmath130 , and @xmath4 ) . the inequality ( [ e4bound ] ) , together with the variational argument constructed in @xcite , can be used to prove that for any density @xmath243 , the ground - state phase is a mixture ( a state of phase separation ) of the @xmath160-phase and @xmath161-phase . specifically , the variational argument shows that for @xmath227 there is a constant @xmath244 such that in any ground - state the number @xmath245 of @xmath135-plaquette excitations is bounded from above as follows : @xmath246 this means that , for @xmath247 and sufficiently large lattice , any ground - state configuration of ions consists of connected regions whose ion configurations are restrictions to these regions of one of the configurations @xmath98 , @xmath103 , @xmath105 .",
    "these connected regions are separated by domain walls that involve negligible , i.e. @xmath248 ( for large lattice @xmath4 ) , fraction of sites .",
    "now , let us fix the ion density , @xmath249 or @xmath222 or @xmath223 , and a sufficiently small @xmath14 .",
    "if we choose an initial value of @xmath83 so that @xmath250 is greater than @xmath185 ( i.e. initially the system is in the state of phase - separation ) , then by decreasing @xmath83 sufficiently the system is driven into a crystalline state .",
    "but obviously , the same result can be arrived at , if we fix the value of @xmath83 and an ( sufficiently small ) initial value of @xmath251 so that @xmath252 , for instance , and then increase @xmath14 . if not the fact that we have ignored the remainder @xmath82 in the effective interaction , this would be the announced in the introduction statement",
    ". thus , it remains to be proven that the remainder @xmath82 does not destroy the picture obtained with the truncated effective interaction @xmath253 .",
    "first , we shall demonstrate that if we take into account @xmath82 , then there is a ( sufficiently small ) constant @xmath251 such that for @xmath254 the sets of ground - state configurations of ions for densities @xmath249 , @xmath222 , @xmath223 coincide with the sets @xmath162 , @xmath163 , and @xmath164 , respectively .",
    "specifically , we shall show that for @xmath254 there are nonempty two - dimensional open domains @xmath255 , @xmath256 , and @xmath257 that are contained in the domains @xmath162 , @xmath163 , and @xmath164 , respectively , and such that in @xmath258 , @xmath259 , the set of ground - state configurations is @xmath260 . to achieve this",
    "we shall construct a lower bound for the energy difference @xmath261 , with @xmath262 .",
    "clearly , we can restrict the set of all configurations @xmath35 to those that do not contain any pairs @xmath143 with @xmath144 . with this restriction , @xmath263 + \\left .",

    "following @xcite we have also the upper bound : @xmath267 for some constant @xmath268 . from ( [ ediff],[e4diff],[r4diff ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath269 note that @xmath260 is an open convex domain in the @xmath165-plane . for @xmath270 , the function @xmath271 ,",
    "being the minimum of a finite set of positive linear functions , is concave , piecewise linear and positive .",
    "it vanishes only at the boundary of @xmath260 .",
    "therefore , there is a ( sufficiently small ) @xmath251 such that for @xmath254 the value of @xmath272 is less than the maximum of @xmath273 over @xmath260 .",
    "then , the level set @xmath274 is a nonempty convex open set , contained in domain @xmath260 . at",
    "this level set the ground - state configurations coincide with the configurations from @xmath260 .",
    "second , we shall show that for a sufficiently small @xmath14 the inequality ( [ t4bound ] ) is modified by @xmath82 only slightly , so that the conclusions drawn from ( [ t4bound ] ) remain valid .",
    "the remainder @xmath82 can be estimated in the following way @xcite : @xmath275 for some constant @xmath276 .",
    "therefore , taking into account the remainder @xmath82 , we replace the inequality ( [ e4bound ] ) by @xmath277 |{\\mathcal{t}}_{-,cb}(s)| & \\leqslant &   \\nonumber \\\\",

    "r^{(4 ) } \\right|_{s_{cb } } & \\leqslant & { \\mathcal{c } } t^{2 }    @xmath278 . as a result ,",
    "the variational argument of @xcite implies that there is a constant @xmath279 such that the following counterpart of ( [ t4bound ] ) holds : @xmath280 consequently , for any density @xmath247 and n.n.n .",
    "interaction @xmath281 the ground - state phase is a mixture of the @xmath282-phase and @xmath161-phase .    summing up ,",
    "let the ion density be one of @xmath249 , @xmath222 , and @xmath223 , and let the corresponding electron density be @xmath283 .",
    "we restrict our considerations to the case @xmath284 , since the situation for @xmath285 can be obtained by means of symmetries ( see subsection 2.1 ) .",
    "let the hopping intensity @xmath14 be sufficiently small .",
    "then , we have proved that the considered system can be driven from the state of phase separation ( the mixture of @xmath160- and @xmath161-phases ) to a crystalline state with a long - range order , which is the @xmath260-phase whose particle densities are the chosen ones , by increasing quantum fluctuations ( measured by @xmath14 ) due to the hopping electrons .    finally , it is easy to see that if the considered model is augmented by a n.n .",
    "repulsion between the ions , then the above analysis of the phase diagram can be carried out without any essential modifications .",
    "thus , we arrive at the same conclusions concerning the transition from a state of phase separation to a state with a long - range order due to increasing hopping .    a similar discussion can be carried out in the case of hard - core bosons , with one exception .",
    "our analysis shows that the transition from a state of phase separation to a state with a long - range order due to an increasing hopping occurs for densities @xmath249 , @xmath223 .",
