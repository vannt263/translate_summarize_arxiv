    "we analyze the current through a one - dimensional array of @xmath2 metallic nanoparticles placed between two electrodes .",
    "we consider the classical coulomb blockade regime with @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath4 is the level spacing , @xmath5 the temperature and @xmath6 the charging energy of the islands , with capacitance @xmath7 . here and in the following the electronic charge @xmath8",
    "we assume that each nanoparticle has a continuum level spectrum ( @xmath9 ) and a constant density of states at the fermi level , but a gap @xmath10 for adding charge .",
    "we restrict electrostatic interactions to those charges on the same conductor : capacitive coupling vanishes .",
    "this limit is referred to as short - range or onsite interaction limit .",
    "the nanoparticles are separated by high tunneling barriers with a resistance much larger than the quantum of resistance . in these conditions the charge in the islands can be assumed fixed and quantized .",
    "eventually we allow tunneling processes between nearest neighbors , and treat the transport at the sequential tunneling level .",
    "a single charge is involved in the tunneling process .",
    "we assume that when a charge hops , the charge density in the final state of the array immediately relaxes to the electrostatic equilibrium configuration .",
    "we take into account that the electrodes are not ideal voltage sources , but have a finite self - capacitance . in equilibrium , and before the tunneling event the electrodes are held at a given potential due to the charge provided by a battery .",
    "we assume that the tunneling time , i.e. the time needed by the electron to cross the tunnel barrier , is smaller than the circuit characteristic time that determines how quickly the battery can transfer charge to the leads in order to restore the voltage at the electrodes . as a consequence , just after the tunneling process the electrodes will not necessarily be at the same potential at which they were at before the tunneling event because the charge , provided by the battery , necessary to restore their initial potentials has not arrived yet .",
    "the voltage is restored to the nominal value before the next tunneling event . for finite - range interactions the potentials on the leads will thus fluctuate in response to all tunneling events , even those that do not directly involve the electrodes . in the short - range case , considered here",
    ", they will fluctuate only when an electron jumps into or out of the leads .",
    "the current is calculated numerically by means of a monte carlo simulation , described in the appendix , which depends on the tunneling rates .",
    "the probability of a tunneling process@xcite is given by @xmath11 with @xmath12 the tunneling resistance of the junction .",
    "we will restrict the discussion to zero temperature for which @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 is the difference between the energy of the system before and after the tunneling event , with the sign convention that @xmath14 is negative if the energy decreases .",
    "it excludes the work done by the battery to recharge the electrodes , as explained before .",
    "the energy gained by tunneling is assumed to be dissipated .",
    "only changes in energy with electrostatic origin are considered .",
    "the energy of our system is given by @xmath15 labels @xmath16 and @xmath17 refer to source and drain electrodes and @xmath18, ... ,@xmath2 to the islands .",
    "in the following , latin capital and lower case letters are used to denote electrodes and islands respectively .",
    "greek indexes will be used when the labels refer to both islands and electrodes . @xmath19 and @xmath20 are respectively the conductor capacitance and the charge in it .",
    "the charges provided by the battery at the source and drain electrodes , which maintain their potentials at @xmath21 and @xmath22 are @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the capacitances of the electrodes are much larger than those of the nanoparticles .",
    "@xmath25 is a random potential at each island due to randomly dispersed charges within the substrate and within the material surrounding the nanoparticles@xcite .",
    "clean arrays will be characterized by @xmath26 for every @xmath27 .",
    "the random potential is included only at the islands because a similar term at each electrode is compensated by the battery and thus has no effect on transport . in the case of disordered arrays , the disorder potentials",
    "can , in principle , take values larger than the charging energy @xmath10 .",
    "however , for large values of the disorder potential , charges flow to compensate for these large fluctuations . in the case of short - range interactions , except if the original disorder potential is very weak , once the screening of the potential due to the mobile charges is taken into account , the set of disorder potentials is uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath28@xcite , and in the following we consider this distribution .    the relevant quantity for the transport is the change in energy due to a tunneling event .",
    "the tunneling process can be seen as the creation of a hole in the conductor @xmath1 from which the charge leaves , @xmath29 , and the addition of an electron in @xmath30 at which the charge arrives , @xmath31 . here and thereafter , we let @xmath32 denote the charge of an electron ( hole ) .",
    "in fact , the change in energy can be rewritten as the energy to create an electron - hole ( also called in the following excitonic energy ) plus the difference in potential between the sites involved in the process before the tunneling event . @xmath33",
    "the first term gives the energy to create an electron - hole pair in an uncharged clean array and is given by @xmath34 this energy does not depend on the direction of tunneling ( from @xmath1 to @xmath30 or from @xmath30 to @xmath1 ) and in the following it will be denoted @xmath35 with @xmath27 running from @xmath18 to @xmath17 .",

    "the potential at each site depends on the charge state of the array prior to the tunneling event . at the electrodes @xmath43 , @xmath44 . at the islands",
    ", the potential can be decomposed into two terms : @xmath25 , a random potential due to random charges in the substrate and @xmath45 a potential due to the charges in the islands . @xmath46 , with @xmath47    analogously we can define the potential drop at each junction @xmath48 with the corresponding disorder and charging terms @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the potential drop at a contact junction depends on the disorder and charge state of the nanoparticle and on the applied bias voltage . on the contrary",
    "the potential drop at a bulk junction is not affected by the bias voltage , except via a change in the charge state .    in the following",
    "we rewrite the potential at the electrodes as @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the total potential drop through the array is @xmath53 . in our model",
    "some measurable properties depend on the value of @xmath1 , which characterizes how the bias voltage is partitioned between source and drain chemical potential shifts . in several previous works the value of @xmath1",
    "was chosen either as @xmath54 , correspondingly to a symmetrically biased array , or as @xmath55 corresponding to completely asymmetric biasing .",
    "@xmath56 has been also called the forward bias condition@xcite both values have been used in the literature , mostly without discussion . in the symmetrically biased case the potential drop at both contact junctions is equally modified by the bias voltage . on the contrary for @xmath57 only the drain ( source ) junction",
    "is affected by the bias .",
    "since no physical properties depend on the overall zero of energy , varying @xmath1 in our model is entirely equivalent to rigidly shifting all impurity potentials by @xmath58 .",
    "the dependence on @xmath1 discussed below , corresponds in part to a dependence on the alignment of the equilibrium source and drain chemical potentials with respect to the addition and removal energies of the electron .",
    "for example for a single nanoparticle on whether the chemical potential shift required to add or remove an electron is larger . since in our model all transport occurs by transfer between adjacent nanoparticles , the evolution of a nanoparticle array as the bias voltage is applied is sensitive to @xmath1 . for a given nanoparticle array with a fixed set of disorder potentials , we believe that the dependence on @xmath1 discussed below should in principle be observable .",
    "whenever not specified we assume that all the junction resistances @xmath59 are equal and given by @xmath60 .",
    "the effect of non homogeneous resistances will be studied in two ways .",
    "one of the junction resistances at a given position is larger than the other ones ( given by @xmath60 ) or resistances , varying in between two values are randomly assigned to the junctions . to mimic that disorder in resistances originates in variations in distances between the islands and the exponential dependence of the junction resistance on the distance between islands",
    "the junction resistance is given by @xmath61 with @xmath62 and @xmath63 input parameters and @xmath64 . here",
    "@xmath65 is a random number between @xmath16 and @xmath18 . in the paper , we have used @xmath66 and @xmath67 . with these values",
    "the resistance changes respectively between ( 5 - 11)@xmath60 , ( 8 - 21)@xmath60 and ( 23 - 83)@xmath60 .",
    "in this section we analyze the dependence of the threshold voltage on the array parameters .",
    "the threshold voltage is controlled by changes in energy in tunneling and not affected by the resistance of the junctions .",
    "thus , we do not address the case of disorder in resistance in this section , as it does not modify the threshold compared to the equal - resistances case .",
    "the threshold voltage is the minimum bias voltage at which current can flow through the array .",
    "a finite bias voltage can assist the entrance of charge to the array from the leads , as it creates a potential drop at the contact junction , which can overcome the excitonic energy .",
    "a finite current requires that charges are able to be transferred from one electrode to the other one across the entire array .",
    "if charge flow can occur between the leads , the threshold voltage is the minimum voltage which permits the entrance of an electron or hole into the array .",
    "however it is possible for charge to become stacked inside the array due to the disorder potential configuration or due to the lack of potential drops across the bulk junctions . in this case",
    "the threshold will be controlled by the flow of charges .    here for disordered arrays we recover previously predicted@xcite values for the average threshold @xmath68 and its root mean square deviation @xmath69 .",
    "@xmath68 is proportional to the number of particles and @xmath69 to @xmath70 . on the contrary , for clean arrays and strictly onsite interactions",
    "the threshold voltage differs from the one expected by extrapolating to zero coupling the value obtained for weakly coupled nanoparticles .",
    "in particular , for finite coupling ( or its zero coupling extrapolation ) an @xmath2-independent threshold voltage is predicted for large arrays , while for strictly zero coupling we obtain @xmath71 .",
    "we also show that its value depends on @xmath1 .",
    "the threshold corresponding to the clean case is plotted in fig .",
    "1(a ) for the case of symmetrically biased arrays ( @xmath72 ) , antisymmetrically biased arrays ( @xmath73 ) , and an intermediate biasing ( @xmath74 ) . in the symmetrically biased case",
    ", @xmath0 shows a step - like dependence on @xmath2 . there is a clear even - odd effect . the even - odd effect in the threshold voltage with the number of particles is absent for @xmath56 and @xmath75 with a threshold voltage @xmath76 .",
    "at strictly zero temperature the tunneling rate @xmath77 and vanishes when @xmath14 is positive or zero . at the inner junctions",
    "@xmath14 is independent of the bias voltage and zero or negative if the two islands differ just by just a single charge . thus the tunneling rate vanishes .",
    "@xmath78 junctions prevent the flow of charges .",
    "a charge gradient at each bulk junction has to be created to allow flow of charge . in the symmetrically biased case ,",
    "increasing the potential at the electrodes allows positive and negative charges to enter from the source and the drain respectively .",
    "these charges accumulate on the array and create potential drops across the bulk junctions . at voltages just below the threshold , the accumulated charges at the first and last islands are equal in number and opposite in sign .",
    "current starts to flow at voltages larger than @xmath79 when @xmath2 is odd and @xmath80 when @xmath2 is even , as these values allow for the build up of @xmath81 and @xmath82 charges at the first and last islands for odd and even @xmath2 respectively .",
    "this corresponds to a charge gradient @xmath83 , across all bulk junctions for odd @xmath2 and across all bulk junctions except one for even @xmath2 . for @xmath55 , charge can only enter the array from one lead and the energy barriers across _ all _",
    "@xmath78 bulk junctions must be overcome by accumulated charges .",
    "when @xmath54 the first and last junctions are equivalent and charge can enter from both leads so it is possible in some cases for the energy barrier across one of the bulk junctions to be overcome by the potential drop due to two injected charges of opposite sign from the two leads , i.e. one of the junctions can be uncharged .",
    "the absence of this possibility is what removes the even - odd effect when @xmath75 and @xmath73 .",
    "an intermediate situation is found for @xmath84 .",
    "complementary information can be obtained by looking at the threshold voltage as a function of @xmath1 for different values of @xmath2 in fig .",
    "the threshold voltage changes in a periodic way with @xmath1 .",
    "the periods of the features in @xmath85 depend on the number of barriers in the array .",
    "dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath2 and periodic features in @xmath0 with respect to @xmath1 reflect the number of charges which have to accumulate in the first and last island prior to current flow .",
    "1(b ) includes curves corresponding to @xmath21 and @xmath22 for specific values of @xmath86 and @xmath87 . as the assymmetry of the array increases ( increasing @xmath88 ) ,",
    "the threshold voltage is alternately determined by the cost of injecting a charge unto the array from the source and the drain . at all",
    "@xmath1 except for the values that lead to the minimum @xmath0 for a given array length , the difference in the charge occupying the first and last islands , @xmath89 , equals @xmath78 .",
    "at the minimum values of @xmath0 , this charge difference equals @xmath90 .     for different values of the asymmetry bias parameter @xmath1 .",

    "the peak and valley dependence reflect the change of contact junction which control the entrance and the number of charges which have to accumulate in the corresponding contact island . for comparison thin solid and dashed lines",

    "( c ) main figure : average threshold voltage for disordered arrays as a function of the number of islands .",
    "the dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath1 disappears on average and a linear dependence on @xmath2 is recovered .",
    "fluctuations in threshold voltage follow @xmath92 as predicted@xcite , width=3 ]    the clean case of a related system was studied by hu and oconnell@xcite .",
    "they analyzed a one - dimensional array of n gated junctions with equal junction capacitances @xmath93 and equal gate capacitances @xmath94 .",
    "due to the finite value of @xmath93 charges in a given island interact with charges in other islands and with charges in the electrodes . with an applied bias voltage",
    "the interaction between charges in the electrodes and in the islands results in a bias induced potential drop at the bulk junctions .",
    "once a charge is injected unto the array , it will have no difficulty in traveling through it , and the threshold voltage equals the voltage required for injection of a charge from the electrodes .",
    "as the ratio @xmath95 increases the threshold voltage of a long array tends to an n - independent value of the order of the charging energy .",
    "the onsite case discussed here corresponds to @xmath96 .",
    "if one extrapolates the case discussed by hu and oconnell@xcite to @xmath97 an n - independent threshold voltage would be expected for onsite interactions .",
    "as shown above , the threshold voltage of clean arrays does not satifies this prediction , as at zero temperature the charges can not travel freely through the array , and the threshold voltage increases with the number of islands .    in the case of disordered arrays , each array has a threshold voltage @xmath0 dependent on the given configuration of disorder @xmath98 .",
    "the threshold voltage depends on @xmath1 , in a way similar to the clean case .",
    "however , as shown in fig .",
    "1(c ) , this dependence on @xmath1 disappears in the average value and we recover middleton and wingreen prediction@xcite . for the disordered case middleton and",
    "wingreen@xcite predicted a linear dependence of the threshold voltage on the array length .",
    "upward steps in the disorder potential @xmath99 prevent the flow of charge . the downward steps @xmath100 facilitate it .",
    "in average there are @xmath101 upward steps . to overcome such steps a charge gradient has to be created in those junctions . for onsite interactions this results in@xcite @xmath102 .",
    "in this limit , they also argued that fluctuations in the values of @xmath0 over many random configurations of disorder are analogous to the fluctuations in the net distance traveled by a 1-d random walk with @xmath2 steps , resulting in @xmath92 .",
    "compared to arrays with no disorder , the threshold of disordered arrays in the onsite limit tends to be smaller because in the clean case , all the bulk junctions inhibit charge flow whereas in the disordered case , only the bulk junctions with positive @xmath49 block charge flow . as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "1(c ) , we also recover the relationship for the fluctuations in the threshold predicted by middleton and wingreen@xcite , @xmath103 .",
    "for bias voltages larger than threshold the current @xmath104 can flow , but it is a strongly non - linear function of voltage . the current depends on the charging energy and number of islands , the presence or not of charge disorder in the array , the resistances of the junctions and on the asymmetry of the applied bias voltage .",
    "linearity and independence on @xmath1 is recovered at large voltages . as discussed by middleton and wingreeen@xcite a power - law dependence of the current on voltage",
    "is found close to threshold . in this section",
    "we discuss the different regimes which can be differentiated in an i - v characteristics and its dependence on the input parameters . at very low voltages",
    "by comparing analytical and numerical results we resolve the controversy on the exponent of the power - law and show it to be linear with a slope which depends on @xmath1 and the resistance of the contact junctions , but that is independent on the array length ( except in a particular case in which an even - odd effect is found ) .",
    "the linearity is however restricted to very small values of @xmath105 .",
    "we also clarify the dependence of the coulomb staircase profile on the bias parameter @xmath1 and estimate the asymptotic current at high voltages , and the bias voltage at which this high voltage regime is found .",
    "very large values of the bias voltage have to be applied to reach this linear dependence .",
    "there has been some controversy regarding the power - law of the current with @xmath106 through one dimensional disordered arrays for voltages close to @xmath0 , @xmath107 .",
    "middleton and wingreen@xcite predicted linear behavior for both the long and short range interaction .",
    "reichardt and reichardt@xcite found a square root behavior using a model with a @xmath108 interaction between the charges in the islands .",
    "they argued that @xmath109 is the exponent corresponding to an sliding charge - density wave .",
    "they pointed out that the larger values of the exponent obtained by middleton and wingreen@xcite are a consequence of using voltages which are not small enough .",
    "kaplan et al.@xcite found @xmath110 in the long - range limit of an array of dots capacitively coupled to their nearest neighbors . finally jha@xcite and",
    "middleton argued that the dependence of the current of disordered arrays in the onsite limit on @xmath106 for voltages marginally greater than @xmath0 is linear with an slope inversely proportional to the length of the array .",
    "numerically they found an approximate linear behavior only in the case of very long arrays but not for the smallest voltages analyzed ( where they found a sublinear dependence ) but in an intermediate voltage regime .",
    "so far , there are no experiments available in completely one - dimensional arrays , but there are a few in quasi - one dimensional systems .",
    "the approximate power - law measured@xcite at voltages @xmath111 is larger than unity which has been attributed to the fact that the system is not strictly one - dimensional .    in this subsection , we show that the current varies linearly with respect to @xmath105 for very small @xmath105 and that the slope is not inversely proportional to @xmath2 .",
    "the slope is sensitive to the resistance of the contact junctions and to the degree of symmetry between the applied bias voltages on the source and drain leads . while this linear dependence is found analytically and in the numerical calculations the value of @xmath106 at which it disappears is very small .",
    "because of the small value of the current at such voltages , the linear dependence most probably can not be seen experimentally .    ) of the curves plotted in the main figures.the linear dependence of current on voltage ( constancy of the derivative )",
    "is clearly seen in all the plots but it disappears for @xmath112 which for the cases shown corresponds to @xmath113 .",
    "( a ) to ( c ) show i - v curves corresponding to arrays without charge disorder .",
    "all junction resistances are equal in ( a ) and ( b ) . as shown in ( a ) for clean arrays the slope of the linear dependence does not depend on the number of islands except for @xmath114 which shows an even - odd effect with a slope equal to unity and @xmath115 for odd and even number of particles , respectively .",

    "( d ) i - v curves of disordered arrays with homogeneous contact resistance .",
    "the @xmath119 curves correspond to different realizations of disorder .",
    "the even - odd effect present for @xmath114 in the clean case has disappeared as just one contact junction acts as bottle - neck.,width=3 ]    the linearity above but very close to threshold can be easily understood .",
    "charges can enter only through the contact junctions from the leads .",
    "the current through the array is equal to the average charge transferred per unit time .",
    "the average time necessary to transfer a charge through the array is the sum of the time involved in all the processes in the sequence of tunneling events from the moment in which charge enters the array from one electrode until it leaves the array to the other one . if the time associated to tunneling at a given junction is much larger than the time involved in the rest of processes , this junction acts as bottleneck and the time necessary to transverse the array is approximately equal to the inverse of the scattering rate through this junction .",
    "thus , the current can be approximated by the tunneling rate across the bottle - neck junction .",
    "below threshold , but close to it , the tunneling at the contact junctions costs finite energy and transport is suppressed .",
    "this cost in energy is reduced by the applied bias voltage and at threshold is zero at the entrance junction .",
    "when @xmath120 but very close to it , the junction from which the charge enters the array acts as bottle - neck for transport , once it is allowed .",
    "at zero temperature , the tunneling rate is @xmath121 .",
    "the dependence on bias voltage of the energy for tunneling compared to the one at threshold , at the source and drain junction is , respectively @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",

    "have to be taken into account in the clean symmetrically biased case when @xmath2 is odd .",
    "@xmath126 when @xmath2 is even and @xmath114 it is necessary that charge enters through both junctions for current to flow and current is approximately equal to @xmath127 this behavior is observed in fig .  2 . the linear behavior is clearly appreciated in both the log - log scale in which the main figures are plotted as well as in the constancy of the derivatives in the insets .",
    "the dependence of the slope of the i - v curves is better seen in the conductance plotted in the insets . as seen in ( a )",
    "the @xmath128 is equal for the @xmath114 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 curves , i.e. independent on the array length . on the contrary ,",
    "it is double for @xmath131 .",
    "this behavior originates in the even - odd alternancy predicted by eqs.([ultimaeq ] ) and ( [ nuevaeq ] ) .",
    "the dependence on @xmath1 is studied in fig.2(b ) . from top to bottom , the change of slope with @xmath1 is smooth and given by @xmath132 as predicted by ( [ primeq ] ) , but turns non monotonously if currents starts being controlled by ( [ segundaeq ] ) with slope @xmath133 . as also expected from the discussion above the slope",
    "is affected by disorder in resistances in fig .",
    "2(c ) , but not by charge disorder in fig .",
    "2(d ) , except in the lose of the even - odd effect present in the clean case for @xmath114 .",
    "the linear behavior in fig .",
    "2 appears for several orders in magnitude . in spite of this",
    ", it disappears for @xmath134 or @xmath113 .",
    "the magnitude of the current is probably too small for this linearity to be detected experimentally .",
    "we have found that linearity gives rise to sublinear behavior when the time of the other tunneling processes become relevant compared to the time spent at the bottle - neck . upon increasing @xmath135 the tunneling rates of the different processes involved in the transport",
    "become more homogeneous . to obtain sublinear behavior , it is just necessary than the two slowest processes in a sequence have comparable rates .",
    "the lost of linearity can depend on the resistance of the junctions when a non bottle - neck junction has a resistance much larger than the bottle - neck one .",
    "the bottle - neck character of a process at a junction at the leads can disappear faster for longer arrays as there are more tunneling processes which will contribute to the total time . in the disordered case , the energy gain of some of the tunneling processes is smaller than in the clean case and the contact junctions can stop being the bottle - neck earlier , i.e. for smaller @xmath105 .",
    "but , in general we have not found very significative differences for different array parameters in the value of the bias voltage at which the linearity disappears .    as the energy of a tunneling process through an inner junction",
    "does not depend on the applied voltage ( except via the charge accumulated on it ) , when a bulk junction controls the transport , the current is independent on voltage showing a characteristic staircase profile .",
    "the existence of the coulomb staircase has been known for a long time@xcite .",
    "early claims reported a coulomb staircase only in the asymmetrically biased case@xcite .",
    "more recent results in clean capacitively coupled nanoparticle arrays , show that a staircase also emerges in a symmetric array under symmetric bias@xcite , but claim that the i - v characteristic for an n - dot array under forward bias is identical to that for a 2n - dot one under symmetric bias .",
    "we show here that while the appearance of the staircase is generic , the last statement is not correct .",
    "the current has kinks at those voltage values which change the maximum number of charges which can be accumulated at the first or last island , allowing new transport processes .",
    "these voltage values depend on the asymmetry @xmath1 and the existence of charge disorder in the array but not on resistance disorder . to allow the addition of an extra charge in the",
    "first or last nanoparticle requires an increase in bias voltage in the adjacent electrode of approximately @xmath136 . in the clean case , when @xmath137 only one electrode changes its potential and the width of the steps in bias voltage is @xmath136 . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath54 the change in potential of a given electrode is just the half of the bias voltage and steps appear in intervals of @xmath138 .    with charge disorder and @xmath55",
    "the position of the kinks slightly depends on voltage , but the width of the voltage intervals between the kinks does not change , as new charges are added through a single junction .",
    "if @xmath54 , charges enter from both contact junctions but the corresponding kinks in the current do not appear at the same position .",
    "while the width of a kink corresponding to a given junction remains @xmath138 in a general case in the i - v characteristic there will be two kinks in each @xmath138 interval in bias voltage due to the alternative position of the kinks of both contact junctions . except in very special cases the separation of kinks does not do equal @xmath136 .",
    "the position of the kinks in the clean and disorder cases can be observed in fig .",
    "two main features can be observed . for clean arrays ( insets in ( a ) and ( b ) ) at the onset",
    "the current shows a big jump . once the charge gradient is created and charge can transverse the array , it flows easily .",
    "the steps at higher voltages are much smaller but have the width predicted above . in the main figures corresponding to disordered arrays , the large big jump has disappeared and steps are more clearly observed .",
    "two stepwidths , which add @xmath139 are seen for @xmath114 and just steps with width @xmath140 appear for @xmath56 .     and @xmath56 .",

    "after we modify the state of the system , we allow the external circuit to return the leads to their applied bias values prior to the selection of the next hop . this effect is simulated by resetting the charges on the source and the drain to the values that restore the nominal applied bias .    in order to remove all sensitivity to initial conditions ,",
    "before we track the evolution of @xmath206 as a function of time at any voltage , we perform @xmath207 iterations to equilibrate the system .",
    "following these iterations , we track the evolution of the charge state until the net number of electrons that arrive at the drain , @xmath208 , equals a very large number ( @xmath209 ) . the average calculated current",
    "is given by @xmath210 where @xmath211 is the sum of all time intervals between hopping processes in the evolution runs .",
    "if a tunneling event involving the drain is selected , an amount @xmath212 is added to @xmath208 depending on whether an electron hopped to or from the drain .",
    "current conservation ensures that the average current is the same through any junction .",
    "the minimum numbers of equilibration cycles , @xmath213 , and evolution cycles ( set by @xmath208 ) depend on the voltage .",

    "<S> nanoparticle arrays made of metallic@xcite , semiconducting@xcite , magnetic@xcite or combined@xcite materials and with radii of the order of 2 - 7 nm can be now synthesized . </S>",
    "<S> the transport properties of these systems are influenced by the ratio between the energy level spacing , the charging energy of the nanoparticles , and the temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the first two quantities depend on the material and the size of the nanoparticle . in the case of metallic nanoparticles , at not too low temperatures , the level spacing is much smaller than the temperature and does not play any role in the transport@xcite . on the contrary , </S>",
    "<S> the charging energy is of the order of 0.1 ev . </S>",
    "<S> strong interactions between the electric charges and the possibility of tuning interparticle coupling make nanoparticles arrays an ideal system to study correlated motion@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , these arrays are strongly influenced by disorder@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> local charging disorder is present in all arrays due to randomly dispersed charged impurities lodged in the substrate or in the materials that separate and surround the nanoparticles . because of the exponential dependence of the tunneling resistance , even a small dispersion in the distance between nanoparticles results in large variations in the tunneling resistances of the junctions . </S>",
    "<S> differences in the island sizes and voids in the lattice can be other sources of disorder@xcite .    due to the combination of disorder and charging effects the current in voltage biased arrays </S>",
    "<S> is blocked up to a threshold voltage@xcite @xmath0 . for bias voltages larger than @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> current is in general non - linear in voltage with a power - law dependence@xcite close to threshold , a linear dependence recovered at high - voltages and frequently a step - like behavior , called a coulomb staircase , at intermediate voltages . </S>",
    "<S> most studies have focused on the statistical analysis of the threshold voltage and on the power - law behavior of the current close to this threshold . </S>",
    "<S> this exponent depends on the dimensionality of the array , but there is controversy between different theoretical approaches in the one - dimensional case , with both linear@xcite and square - root@xcite predictions . </S>",
    "<S> much experimental work has been concentrated on two and three dimensional arrays , but some quasi - one dimensional systems have also been fabricated@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> comparison between experiments and theory is not yet well settled .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we provide a complete description of the zero - temperature transport properties of one - dimensional metallic nanoparticle arrays for the case in which interactions are restricted to charges in the same nanoparticle ( onsite limit ) . in a separate work@xcite </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the effect of the long - range character of the interactions on these properties . </S>",
    "<S> we resolve the controversy on the power - law , analyze carefully dependencies on different array parameters and estimate the voltage which delimits each of the transport regimes to favor comparison with experiment . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss arrays with and without charge disorder . </S>",
    "<S> although clean arrays are mainly of academic interest , their analysis will help us to understand the main features of the experimentally more relevant , disordered arrays . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of variations in the junction resistances is also analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> disorder in capacitances ( nanoparticle size variations ) is not considered as it is less important in present experiments . </S>",
    "<S> nanoparticles synthesized nowadays are monodispersed in size to a few percent . in any case </S>",
    "<S> , the effect of capacitance disorder@xcite in most of the properties studied here can be deduced from the analytic approximations provided in the text . due to the one - dimensionality of the array and the nearest neighbor tunneling </S>",
    "<S> considered we assume that there are no nanoparticle voids in the array , as this would completely prevent current flow . </S>",
    "<S> we have analyzed the threshold voltage , the i - v characteristics , close to threshold but also at larger bias voltages and the potential drop through the array . among the results presented </S>",
    "<S> we show that the threshold voltage of clean arrays in the onsite case does not approach the one found for capacitively coupled junctions in the limit of weak coupling@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the controversy in the power - law dependence of current on bias voltage close to threshold is clarified and shown to be linear , but with a slope different from the one previously predicted@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we find signatures of correlated charging of the system in the potential drop through the array , especially at intermediate values of the bias voltage . </S>",
    "<S> we show that even at high voltages , with the conductance controlled by the sum of the resistances in series , the potential drop through the array is not completely linear , but it has a contribution due to charging effects . </S>",
    "<S> we identify an asymmetry external parameter @xmath1 which controls the bias voltage drop . </S>",
    "<S> the influence of @xmath1 has barely been discussed in previous works . </S>",
    "<S> we show that its effect can _ a priori _ be observed experimentally in the width of the coulomb staircase steps . </S>",
    "<S> calculations are perfomed numerically , but analytic approximations are given in several limits and compared with numerical results . </S>"
