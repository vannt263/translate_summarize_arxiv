    "jet suppression  @xcite is considered an excellent probe of qcd matter created in ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "specifically , charged hadrons and d mesons are often in the focus of both theoretical and experimental research , since they represent the most direct probes of light and heavy flavor in qcd matter . however , while d meson suppression is indeed a clear charm quark probe , this is not the case for light hadrons .",
    "that is , while experimentally measured prompt d mesons are exclusively composed of charm quarks  @xcite , light hadrons are composed of both light quarks and gluons  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , gluons are known to have larger jet energy loss compared to light and heavy quarks , while light and charm quarks are expected to have similar suppressions  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore clearly expected that charged hadron suppression should be significantly larger compared to d meson suppression .",
    "however , preliminary alice measurements  @xcite surprisingly show that charged hadrons and d mesons have the same @xmath0 .",
    "we here denote this surprising observations as the `` heavy flavor puzzle at lhc '' , and explaining this puzzle is the main goal of this paper .",
    "we note that , perhaps the most straightforward explanation of the puzzle would be that , contrary to pqcd expectations , gluons and light quarks in fact lose the same amount of energy in the medium created at ultra relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "in fact , the same possibility was also suspected in the context of rhic experiments  @xcite , where similar suppressions were observed for pions and single electrons ; this has led some theorists to seek explanations outside conventional qcd  @xcite .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to analyze phenomena behind the `` heavy flavor puzzle at lhc '' , and investigate if pqcd is able to explain such unexpected experimental data .",
    "to analyze the puzzle described in the previous section , we will here use our recently developed theoretical formalism , which is outlined in detail in  @xcite .",
    "the procedure is based on _",
    "i ) _ jet energy loss in a finite size dynamical qcd medium  @xcite , _ ii ) _ finite magnetic mass effects  @xcite , _ iii ) _ running coupling  @xcite , _ iv ) _ multigluon fluctuations  @xcite , _ v ) _ path - length fluctuations  @xcite and _ v ) _ most up to date production  @xcite and fragmentation functions  @xcite . note that the computational procedure uses no free parameters , i.e. the parameters that are stated below correspond to the standard literature values .",
    "we consider a qgp of temperature @xmath1mev ( as extracted by alice  @xcite ) , with @xmath2 effective light quark flavors .",
    "perturbative qcd scale is taken to be @xmath3  gev .",
    "for the light quarks we assume that their mass is dominated by the thermal mass @xmath4 , and the gluon mass is @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "here debye mass @xmath6  gev is obtained by self - consistently solving eq .",
    "( 3 ) from  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) , and magnetic mass @xmath7 is taken as @xmath8  @xcite . charm and bottom",
    "mass is , respectively , @xmath9  gev and @xmath10  gev . for charm and bottom , the initial quark spectrum , @xmath11 ,",
    "is computed at next - to - leading order using the code from  @xcite ; for gluons and light quarks , the initial distributions are computed at next - to - leading order as in  @xcite . for light hadrons ,",
    "we use dss fragmentation functions  @xcite . for d mesons",
    "we use bcfy fragmentation functions  @xcite .",
    "path length distributions are extracted from  @xcite , while fragmentation functions are implemented according to  @xcite .",
    "we start by quantitatively reproducing the expectations summarized in the introduction , in order to obtain a clear view of the relevant hierarchies for the suppression and the initial distributions .",
    "[ quarkelossraa ] shows the comparison of the suppressions for light and charm quark and gluon jets .",
    "we see that suppression of gluon jets is significantly larger compared to corresponding suppression of quark jets , while the suppression predictions for light and charm quarks are similar . furthermore , in fig .",
    "[ glratio ] we show that both light quarks and gluons significantly contribute to the charged hadron production - in fact , in the lower momentum range , gluons dominate over light quarks ; therefore both contributions from gluons and light quarks have to be taken into account when analyzing charged hadron suppression .",
    "on the other hand , d mesons present a clear charm quark probe , since the feedown from b mesons is subtracted from the experimental data  @xcite .    as discussed above , figures  [ quarkelossraa ] and  [ glratio ] lead to the expectation that the charged hadron suppression should be significantly larger than the d meson suppression .",
    "surprisingly , this expectation is not confirmed by the experimental data , which are shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ theoryvsdata ] ; these data clearly suggest the same suppression for both pions and d mesons .",
    "we can also calculate these @xmath0s through the finite size dynamical energy loss formalism  @xcite , which is shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ theoryvsdata ] .",
    "even more surprisingly , these calculations are in accordance with the experimental data , i.e. they show the same suppression patterns for light hadrons and d mesons . moreover , we see that the theoretical predictions even reproduce the experimentally observed smaller suppression of d mesons compared to charged hadrons in the lower momentum range .",
    "this difference is the consequence of the `` dead cone effect ''  @xcite , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ quarkelossraa ] .",
    "consequently , we see that our theoretical predictions show a very good agreement with the experimental data , which is in an apparent contradictions with the qualitative expectations discussed above ; we will below concentrate on finding the explanation for these unexpected results .",
    "we start by asking how fragmentation functions modify light hadron and d meson suppressions , since these functions define the transfer from the parton to the hadron level .",
    "we first analyze how fragmentation functions modify the d mason suppression , compared to the bare charm quark suppression .",
    "we see that there is a negligible difference between these two suppression patterns , so that d meson fragmentation does not modify bare charm quark suppression .",
    "consequently , the d meson suppression is indeed a genuine probe of the charm quark suppression in qcd medium .",
    "however , there is a significantly more complex interplay between suppression and fragmentation in charged hadrons . in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ lightflavorraa ] , we compare the light hadron suppression with the bare light quark and gluon suppression patterns . surprisingly , we see that the light hadron suppression pattern almost exactly coincides with the bare light quark suppression .",
    "this may suggest that gluon jets do not contribute to the light hadron suppression , which is however clearly inconsistent with the significant ( even dominant ) gluon contribution in light hadrons ( see fig .  [ glratio ] ) . to further investigate this , in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ lightflavorraa ] , we show what would be the light hadron suppression if hadrons were composed only by light quark jets ( the dashed curve ) , or only by gluon jets ( the dot - dashed curve ) .",
    "we see that , as expected from fig .",
    "[ glratio ] , the actual light hadron suppression is clearly in between the two above mentioned suppression alternatives , so that both light quarks and gluons indeed significantly contribute to the light hadron suppression .",
    "however , by comparing the two panels in fig .",
    "[ lightflavorraa ] , we see that light hadron fragmentation functions modify the bare light quark and gluon suppressions so that , coincidentally , their `` resultant '' charged hadron suppression almost identically reproduces the bare light quark suppression .",
    "consequently , the heavy flavor puzzle at lhc is a consequence of a specific combination of the suppression and fragmentation patterns for light partons , and it does not require invoking an assumption of the same energy loss for light partons .",
    "a major theoretical goal in relativistic heavy ion physics is to develop a theoretical framework that is able to consistently explain both light and heavy flavor experimental data .",
    "we here analyzed the comparison of charged hadron and d meson suppression data in central 2.76 tev pb+pb collisions at lhc , which leads to a surprising puzzle . to analyze this puzzle",
    ", we here used a dynamical energy loss formalism .",
    "while the solution of this puzzle is inherently quantitative , it can be qualitatively summarized in the following way : despite the dominant gluon contribution in the charged hadron production , lhc charged hadron suppression turns out to be a genuine probe of bare light quark suppression . the main effect responsible for this key result is the distortion of the bare suppression patterns by the jet fragmentation .",
    "furthermore , the d meson suppression correctly represents charm quark suppression , and bare charm and light quark suppressions are very similar . taken together",
    ", these results in fact explain the observed puzzle , i.e. the fact that light hadron and d meson suppression are measured to be the same at lhc .",
    "therefore , the explanation of the puzzle follows directly from pqcd calculations of the energy loss and fragmentation .",
    "furthermore , these calculations directly relate the bare quark suppressions to the experimentally observed charged hadron suppressions .",
    "consequently , the heavy flavor puzzle at lhc is not only a coincidental combination of suppression and fragmentation patterns , but also their serendipitous interplay , which can substantially simplify the interpretation of the relevant experiments .    _",
