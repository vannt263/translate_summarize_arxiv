    "despite of a large number of studies on localization of energy in pure anharmonic lattices @xcite , the mechanism of their thermal generation is still under debate .",
    "this is clearly a central issue being directly related with the possibility of observing signature of such a class of excitations in experiments on real crystals .",
    "the problem of nanoscale energy localization has turned out to be rather important also in view of its possible application for different physical and biological systems .",
    "the theoretical studies at finite energy per particle dealt mainly with one - dimensional models belonging both to the fermi - pasta - ulam ( fpu ) class of model @xcite ( with acoustic spectrum in the harmonic limit ) and to the klein - gordon one @xcite ( with optical - phonon - type spectrum in the harmonic limit ) .",
    "some attention has been also recently payed to the discretized version of the nonlinear schrdinger equation in one dimension @xcite .    of special interest",
    "is the numerically observed fact that excitation of short - wavelength extended modes of the chain and their instability with respect to perturbations with nonvanishing wavenumber leads generically to creation of localized states .",
    "the phenomenology emerging from the numerical studies @xcite can be summarized in three main stages . in the first one , after the development of the modulational instability , energy localizes along the chain in the form of an array of almost standing `` bumps '' .",
    "after a given time ( that increase upon decreasing the temperature ) those begin to merge diminishing their number and localization lengths .",
    "this second stage ( which is reminiscent of the phenomenon of `` soliton turbulence '' @xcite ) ends with the emergence of a single localized and moving object ( a `` breather '' ) , carrying along a macroscopic fraction of the total energy . in the third stage",
    ", the breather continues to slow down radiating its energy towards the background until it eventually disappears and the equipartition ( thermal equilibrium ) state is attained .",
    "the aim of this paper is to give a consistent quantitative explanation of such behaviour , in particular of the apparent paradoxical tendence of the system to increase localization as time goes by .",
    "namely , we would like to clarify the role of the finite vibrational energy density on the formation of strongly localized envelope solitons and breathers and their temporal evolution in the anharmonic fpu chain .",
    "this is accomplished by means of a suitable continuum approximation for the lattice dynamics .",
    "the approach in terms of the envelope - function equation including higher - order nonlinear terms has been already introduced to describe short - wavelength excitations in the fpu chain @xcite and is reviewed in section ii .",
    "it is a useful framework both for computing localized solution in the form of envelope soliton ( es ) and breather ( section iii ) , and for describing the modulational instability ( section iv ) .",
    "furthermore , going beyond the usual integrable approximation @xcite is of crucial importance to explain the localization process ( sections v and vi ) .",
    "we described analytically the initial - energy - density dependence of all characteristic time scales of the envelope soliton formation and merging .",
    "particular emphasis has been also given to the analytic computation and numerical measurements of the spatial power spectra ( `` structure functions '' ) that , at least in principle , are of importance for real experiments .",
    "indeed , they turn out to be extremely useful for the physical interpretation of the simulation results ( see , e.g. , sections v and vii ) . finally , a brief discussion of the finite - temperature effects is reported in section viii .",

    "the lowest order potential describing the anharmonicity of the longitudinal or pure transverse motion in a centrosymmetric @xmath8 lattice corresponds , respectively , to @xmath9 or @xmath10 . from the hamiltonian ( [ hami ] ) we obtain the following equations of motion : @xmath11~. \\label{eqmot}\\ ] ] in the following",
    ", periodic boundary conditions are always assumed .    in order to describe the short - wavelength excitations of the chain with wavenumber @xmath12 ( @xmath13 being the lattice spacing ) , i.e. near the brillouin - zone boundary , it is convenient to introduce an envelope - function of the displacements @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",

    "as already mentioned , this scaling is in agreement with the numerical observation @xmath219 .",
    "in the previous section we explained why the scattering favors the creation of a single localized object .",
    "we now give a brief account of some of its properties .",
    "the @xmath220 patterns reported in the left panels of figs .",
    "[ brea ] and [ position ] illustrate the remarkable fact that a macroscopic fraction of the total energy accumulates on a few sites .",
    "for instance for the case @xmath170 and @xmath221 , only @xmath222 sites bear an energy 10.9 corresponding to about 30% of the total .",
    "as expected from the previous section , the remaining is distributed along the chain in the form of small amplitude ( harmonic ) oscillations ( see again fig .",
    "[ brea ] )    if we observe the breather on a time scale during which its amplitude does not change considerably , we see that it randomly alternates between a standing and moving state .",
    "[ position ] clearly shows how each motion occurs with an almost constant velocity and is accompanied by changes of the shape . for a given amplitude ,",
    "the modulus of such a velocity is always the same .",
    "we checked that its value is consistent with previous studies on exact breather solution : for example from fig .",
    "[ position ] we found indeed the velocity to be 0.12(8 ) in excellent agreement with the value 0.120 obtained interpolating the data of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the main issue concerning the velocity is the one of its selection .",
    "although we will not enter into details here , we just anticipate that some analytic clue can be achieved by studying the moving solutions of eq .",
    "( [ envelope ] ) @xcite .",
    "in particular , we expect the velocity to increase with the amplitude ( almost linearly in the large - amplitude limit @xmath58 ) , a fact that is actually consistent with our as well as with other simulations @xcite .",
    "let us now discuss the power spectra of those strongly localized states .",
    "the right panels of fig .",
    "[ brea ] show how they differ depending on the amplitude . at smaller energies ( upper panels ) they resemble more closely an es and the spectrum would have the exponentially decaying prescribed by ( [ spesol ] ) . upon increasing the energy",
    ", @xmath141 acquires a sinusoidal component like ( [ spebreaex ] ) characteristic of a breather solution .",
    "this is simply the consequence of the fact that in the continuum approach the two are the only limiting cases of the general solution ( [ implicit ] ) with the amplitude @xmath43 being determined only by the total energy of the lattice .",
    "obviously , the existence of the vibrational background affects the structure of the spectra . as the background contains a non - negligible energy ( the remaining 70% in the case mentioned above ) , a complete description of the spectra requires some information on its features .",
    "one consequence that we can draw from fig .",
    "[ brea ] is that the naive picture of a single breather moving through a gas of small waves is oversimplified .",
    "in fact this would imply the spectrum to be a sum of a part like ( [ spebrea ] ) plus an almost flat part",
    ". the form of @xmath141 seems rather to indicate that only the high - frequency domain of the harmonic spectrum is populated .    to give a complete description of the relaxation process",
    ", we should now consider the final stage of the breather destruction ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion ) .",
    "this requires understanding how energy is transferred from large to small wavenumbers .",
    "this issue involves in turn the interaction of a large - amplitude es with small - amplitude plane waves .",
    "the latter problem has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we limit ourselves to observe that it is still not clear how to explain why the tipical time scale for such a process should scale again as @xmath189 .",
    "an analytic argument for that can be actually given only in the very last stage , when the system is sufficiently close to equilibrium and relaxation of fourier modes can be described by usual linear - response theory @xcite .",
    "what has been sofar discussed refers to a situation where all the lattice energy is initially fed in the boundary mode .",
    "this is clearly not realistic for actual experimental conditions , when the system is in contact with a thermal bath which populates all the other modes even at ( classically ) low temperatures .",
    "one may therefore wonder to what extent the mechanisms described above are effective in localizing the energy .",
    "in the present section we try to approach the problem by first considering a more general class of initial conditions defined by replacing second expression in ( [ ic ] ) by @xmath223 where @xmath224 is a gaussian random number such that @xmath225 and @xmath226 . in order to assign the initial energy per particle to be equal to @xmath34 , we choose @xmath227 and @xmath228 .",
    "the parameter @xmath229 controls thus the  level of noise \" in the initial conditions .",
    "indeed , the limit @xmath230 ( exactly the one considered in the previous simulations ) amounts to feeding all the available energy in the brillouin - zone - boundary mode whereas upon increasing @xmath229 , we can initially excite also the other fourier modes of the chain . with our definition , equilibrium ( i.e. equipartition of energy )",
    "is attained for @xmath231 ( actually when @xmath232 ) .",
    "the results presented before can be first extended to the finite @xmath229- values by the following reasoning .",
    "we showed that the initial density of ess is basically determined by the vibrational energy available in the brillouin - zone - boundary mode .",
    "therefore , one can straightforwardly replace @xmath233 by @xmath234 in eq .",
    "( [ ns ] ) obtaining @xmath235 as seen in fig .",
    "[ nssigma ] , the numerical data are in good agreement with this formula , at least for moderate amplitudes @xmath236 .",
    "this indicates that the mechanism of vibrational energy localization , induced by the modulational instability is relatively robust , at least with respect to those type of perturbation in the initial conditions .",
    "remarkably , as soon as @xmath229 overcomes the value @xmath237 , @xmath152 seems to be slightly less ( around 10 % ) than what is expected from the purely energetic argument leading to ( [ nss ] ) .",
    "although in this intermediate regime the numerical measurements are definitely less accurate due to the large vibrational background , we can at least give a qualitative justification to this .",
    "in fact , in this case we expect some effective dissipative mechanisms to enter into play and some of the localized excitation will be effectively damped out by the interaction with the `` thermal bath '' of the other vibrational modes @xcite .",
    "in order to better clarify this , we performed also some measurements of the power spectrum ( [ sk ] ) for the relatively large values of @xmath229 ( see fig .",
    "[ sigbrea ] ) .",
    "the results confirm that even for @xmath238 ( lower panels ) some kind of  localization \" is still present , although it is hardly detectable by direct measurements .    to summarize ,",
    "the creation of localized excitations , induced by the modulational instability , is more and more inhibited the closer one starts to the equipartition ( thermal equilibrium ) state .",
    "this is caused both by the less amount of energy available in the corresponding short - wavelength mode ( as @xmath239 for @xmath240 , see eq .",
    "( [ velocity ] ) ) and by the effective dissipation caused by the interaction of small - amplitude ess with the vibrational background . at least in principle",
    ", the envelope - function approach could be a useful starting point for a more detailed analysis once one would be able to take into account the fluctuating background by casting it in suitable stochastic terms .",
