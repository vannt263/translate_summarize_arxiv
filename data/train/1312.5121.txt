    "when jaynes and cummings introduced their theory of the molecular beam maser in 1963,@xcite they presumably had no idea that their modest quantum model comprising a two - level system coupled to a quantized harmonic oscillator would still be the subject of active research fifty years later .",
    "the sheer simplicity of the model , and the fact that it features the interaction of two of the most basic quantum systems , have allowed it to be applied to numerous experimental systems beyond the original maser setting . for many years",
    "the primary experimental realization was in cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cavity qed ) , in which an atom interacts with the electromagnetic field inside an optical or microwave cavity.@xcite in the absence of a full analytical solution , theoretical treatments were dominated by the rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) applied by jaynes and cummings , which provides an excellent description of the energies and eigenstates within the parameter regimes accessible in cavity qed experiments.@xcite however , recent years have seen a proliferation of engineered quantum systems whose behavior is well described by the same model , including several types of superconducting qubits coupled to microwave waveguide resonators,@xcite lc resonators ,  @xcite or mechanical resonators  @xcite ; intersubband transitions in semiconductor microcavities  @xcite ; photochromic molecules in metallic cavities  @xcite ; quantum wells coupled to split - ring resonators  @xcite ; and a photonic analogue in waveguide superlattices  @xcite .",
    "such systems are capable of accessing very different parameter regimes , in particular much larger coupling strengths than those available in cavity qed , which has in turn inspired a revival of theoretical interest in the model .",
    "the hamiltonian for the two - level system oscillator system may be written as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the energy difference between the levels of the two - level system ( for which we will use the term ` qubit ' ) , @xmath2 is the frequency of the oscillator , and @xmath3 is the strength of the coupling between them .",
    "this is often called the ( quantum ) rabi model or the single - mode spin - boson hamiltonian , since the term `` jaynes - cummings model '' has become synonymous with the rwa .    in recent years",
    "considerable progress has been made in understanding the full model without the rwa .",
    "formally exact mathematical solutions have finally been found  @xcite , after many years of uncertainty as to whether such solutions even existed . at a more intuitive level",
    ", the model may be divided into several regimes depending on the ratios @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "it is now well understood that the rwa is suitable for near - resonance , @xmath6 , and small coupling , @xmath7 .",
    "away from resonance , the small coupling limit @xmath8 may be treated with standard perturbation theory .",
    "hence current theoretical research is mostly focused on the very strong coupling limit , @xmath9 .    for the regime in which @xmath10",
    ", an excellent approximation may be obtained from lowest - order degenerate perturbation theory in the basis of states obtained by setting @xmath11 in eq .  , for which we will use the term `` adiabatic approximation ''  @xcite .",
    "the same expressions can also be derived by other methods @xcite .",
    "this approximation provides good agreement with the numerically determined eigenstates and energies for arbitrary coupling values when @xmath12 . although the adiabatic approximation is derived on the assumption of small @xmath1 , qualitative agreement with numerics persists over the full range of coupling strengths as long as @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "a number of techniques have been proposed to make quantitative corrections to the states and energies but the corrections generally prove to be small , reaching their largest values for the lowest levels and as @xmath1 approaches @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the situation becomes more complicated for @xmath14 .",
    "variational treatments based on the form of the adiabatic approximation have been shown to improve the ground - state energies and wavefunctions for larger values of @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "however , the excited states can not generally be treated in this way . as @xmath1 becomes equal to or greater than @xmath2",
    ", resonances occur in the excited - state spectrum at small coupling values  @xcite ; the effect of this is that unphysical level crossings appear in the adiabatic energy levels .",
    "this represents a qualitative change in the eigenstates and energies which must be treated by different methods  @xcite . at larger coupling ,",
    "the effect of these resonances is no longer observed and the adiabatic approximation still works well , both qualitatively and quantitatively  @xcite .",
    "this regime has been termed the ` deep strong coupling ' limit in the literature  @xcite , and the criterion usually given for achieving this limit is @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "it has been known for quite some time that a critical point at @xmath16 exists in some semiclassical approximations in the slow - oscillator limit , at which the nature of the system s wavefunction undergoes a sharp change  @xcite .",
    "the behavior of various system observables in this region has been studied in detail by ashhab  @xcite .",
    "the existence of the critical point implies that the criterion for achieving the deep strong coupling limit , when the adiabatic approximation becomes a good description , must be modified .",
    "this leaves a wide intermediate coupling region , including the critical point itself , in which the behavior of the system may be expected to deviate strongly from both weak - coupling theory and the adiabatic approximation .",
    "there is evidence that squeezing of the oscillator state is involved to some extent near the critical point .",
    "a number of authors have incorporated squeezing into variational studies of the ground state  @xcite , and numerical calculations have shown how the squeezing parameter in the ground state scales with @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of squeezing in wavepacket evolution has been discussed by sandu et al .",
    "@xcite and larson  @xcite .",
    "however , the properties of the system , particularly its dynamics , in this intermediate coupling regime are still far from fully understood .    in this paper",
    "we address the case of @xmath17 , for couplings above the critical point but below the region in which the adiabatic approximation becomes valid .",
    "we present an approximate solution for both ground and excited states and show that , under certain conditions , it predicts tunneling - like behavior for the oscillator . in section 2",
    "we derive the approximation for the energies and wavefunctions of the system , discuss its range of validity , and calculate dynamics of both oscillator and qubit observables .",
    "section 3 contains a discussion of several ways to interpret the dynamical behavior in terms of effective double - well potentials .",
    "prospects for experimental observations of the tunneling dynamics in nanomechanical systems are outlined in section 4 , and we draw some brief conclusions in section 5 .",
    "the hamiltonian can also be expressed as @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the hamiltonians of oscillators displaced to the left and right , respectively : @xmath21 if the qubit energy term ( first term in ( [ e1 ] ) and ( [ e2 ] ) ) is neglected , the energy eigenstates are simply displaced number states of the oscillator , associated with either the @xmath22 state of the qubit ( left - displaced ) or the @xmath23 state ( right - displaced ) .",
    "this is the starting point of the adiabatic approximation  @xcite , in which the @xmath1 term is treated perturbatively . here , however , we are interested in studying the case @xmath24 .",
    "one approach that has been taken previously is to treat the displacement of the oscillators as a variational parameter and minimize the ground state energy with respect to the displacement .",
    "while this does improve upon the ground state of the adiabatic approximation , it is not particularly accurate in the intermediate coupling regime and , furthermore , produces unphysical ` kinks ' in the values of various observables including the energy  @xcite .",
    "we begin instead with a variational test function in which both the oscillator displacement and the rotation of the qubit state are taken as variational parameters : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a coherent state , with wavefunction , in the coordinate representation , @xmath27 , \\label{e5}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 with @xmath29 the mass of the oscillator .",
    "assuming @xmath30 to be real , the expectation value of @xmath31 in the state @xmath32 is @xmath33 we may search for the ground state energy by minimizing with respect to the parameters @xmath30 and @xmath34 . if @xmath35 there is only one minimum , at @xmath36 and @xmath37 , but if instead the condition @xmath38 holds , there are two minima , given by @xmath39 and @xmath40 , with @xmath41 and @xmath42 in the remainder of this paper , we will assume that condition always holds .",
    "also , for definiteness , assume that @xmath43 is chosen so that @xmath44 , which makes @xmath45",

    "states of definite parity may be obtained by taking the superpositions @xmath50 where @xmath51 is an appropriate normalization factor , which is needed because @xmath52 and @xmath53 are not , in general , orthogonal .",

    "all the @xmath67 are orthogonal for different @xmath65 , as are the @xmath68 , but the left- and right - displaced states , as indicated above , are not orthogonal to each other .",

    "to lowest order in the overlap factor , then , we obtain the simpler result @xmath175 for the cases illustrated in fig .",
    "[ energies ] , the spectra predicted by eq .",
    "are virtually indistinguishable from those predicted by eq .  .",
    "we next observe that the functions @xmath176 ^ 2 $ ] can be used to define probability distributions in the interval @xmath177 , with expectation value @xmath178 and variance @xmath179 .",
    "observation then shows that @xmath180 decays rapidly for @xmath181 greater than @xmath182 plus about two standard deviations ; hence , a condition to have tightly spaced doublets in eq .",
    "( [ n30 ] ) can be expressed as @xmath183 , or , again numbering the doublets beginning with @xmath184 instead of zero , @xmath185 for @xmath186 the left - hand side of ( [ n31 ] ) has the values @xmath187 , whereas , for the case depicted in fig .",
    "3(a ) , we have @xmath188 , and for the case in fig .",
    "3(b ) we have @xmath189 .",
    "hence this equation appears to predict well the number of tunneling doublets in both cases ( one in the first instance and three in the second ; see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) . for large @xmath65",
    ", the left - hand side can be expanded to yield @xmath190 to leading order , this agrees with all the previous estimates of an effective barrier , whose height at @xmath127 is of the order of @xmath191 , although there clearly are differences between the estimates as well .    from the foregoing considerations",
    ", it appears that the predictions of the fully quantized system , both from the approximation developed in section 2 and from numerical calculations of the full hamiltonian , are consistent with the semiclassical picture : the interaction with the high - frequency qubit creates an effective potential that takes on a double - well shape for couplings that satisfy @xmath192 . within this potential , an initial state of the oscillator that is localized in one well tunnels through the barrier and back again .",
    "it is worth noting here that the dynamics displayed in fig .",
    "[ oscdynamics ] is distinctly different to that of an oscillator coherent state in a single - well potential ; see , for comparison , fig .  1 of ref .  .",
    "our approximation provides a simple but effective means of calculating the tunneling doublet energy splittings and hence the tunneling frequency , as well as predicting how many doublets lie below the energy barrier and thus display tunneling behavior .",
    "the tunneling effect discussed here could potentially be realized in a number of different systems .",
    "perhaps the most exciting experiments from a fundamental point of view would involve a nano- or micro - mechanical resonator as the oscillator component , whose dynamics could then be interpreted as quantum tunneling of a macroscopic object with a direct everyday classical analog .",
    "significant advances over the past few years have shown that this idea is not entirely unrealistic .",
    "mechanical resonators have been cooled very close to the quantum ground state ( @xmath193 , where @xmath194^{-1}$ ] is the average number of thermal phonons in a resonator of frequency @xmath2 at temperature @xmath195 ) by cryogenic techniques  @xcite and by sideband cooling via coupling to microwave  @xcite or optical  @xcite fields .",
    "coupling between mechanical resonators and superconducting qubits has been achieved  @xcite , and rabi oscillations involving the exchange of a single quantized excitation between a qubit and a resonator have been observed  @xcite .",
    "further evidence of the quantum nature of a mechanical resonator was provided by a measurement of the distinctively quantum asymmetry in the noise spectrum  @xcite .",
    "a few theoretical proposals for creating double - well potentials in which mechanical tunneling could be observed have also been put forward  @xcite .    in trying to set up a tunneling experiment ,",
    "one faces two conflicting difficulties . on the one hand , if the tunneling states have energies well below the barrier , so that the probability to find the system in between the two wells is very small , the energy splitting will be exceedingly small , and the tunneling time will become too long for the system to remain undisturbed . on the other hand , if the states are near the top of the barrier , so that the tunneling time is reasonable , then thermal activation becomes a potential problem that may mask the tunneling signal .",
    "the time scales for tunneling in the qubit - oscillator system compare well with decoherence times in state - of - the - art mechanical experiments . for a typical superconducting qubit frequency of @xmath196 and a resonator frequency @xmath197 ,",
    "a coupling value of @xmath198 gives one tunneling doublet near the top of the barrier ( see eq .   and",
    "[ fig3](a ) ) .",
    "the time for one transit of the barrier @xmath199 , with @xmath114 given by eq .  , is then 5.9  ns .",
    "this is very close to the resonator energy relaxation time of 6.1  ns measured for a 6  ghz dilatational resonator in the experiments of oconnell _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ; in the same experiment , the qubit relaxation time was found to be an anomalously short 17  ns .",
    "although high resonator frequency is desirable for shortening the tunneling time , higher frequency comes at the cost of significantly shorter decay times . as another example , take a 100  mhz oscillator with the same 10  ghz qubit . in this case",
    "the fractional coupling needed to have one doublet below the barrier is larger , about @xmath200 .",
    "the resulting tunneling time is @xmath201 , which compares favorably with the typical 1  @xmath202 decoherence time of superconducting qubits .",
    "resonators with frequencies in the range of 10 - 100  mhz typically have @xmath203 values on the order of @xmath204  @xcite . for these low - frequency oscillators ,",
    "the important parameter is the rate at which thermal quanta are exchanged with the relatively hot environment , quantified by the thermal decoherence time @xmath205 where @xmath206 is the environment temperature  @xcite . while exact values depend on the details of the environment , palomaki _ et al .",
    "_ estimated @xmath207 in an experiment on a 10.5  mhz resonator  @xcite .",
    "therefore the qubit decoherence time is likely to be the limiting factor when a low - frequency resonator is used .    while a full treatment of thermal effects is beyond the scope of this paper ,",
    "an estimate of the thermal activation rate @xmath208 can be made using the arrhenius rate equation  @xcite : @xmath209 , where @xmath210 is the difference in potential between the bottom of the well and the top of the barrier .",
    "the crossover temperature @xmath211 at which the thermal activation rate drops below the quantum tunneling rate can be found by setting @xmath212 , giving @xmath213^{-1 } , \\ ] ] where @xmath210 can be estimated from eqs .   and and @xmath114 is given by eq .  .",
    "for the first set of parameters considered above , @xmath214 , within the range of modern dilution refrigerators . at lower resonator frequencies",
    "the crossover temperature becomes more challenging to achieve ; for the second set of parameters above , @xmath215 .",
    "thus while lower frequency resonators have the advantage of much higher quality factors and consequently longer thermal decoherence times , high frequency provides a significant advantage in distingushing quantum tunneling from thermal activation over the barrier .",
    "the time scales and temperatures required for observation of quantum tunneling in our scenario are within the reach of current nanomechanics technology .",
    "however , one outstanding technical challenge remains , which is achieving the very large qubit - oscillator coupling strength needed to reach the double - well regime .",
    "values for @xmath5 in current experiments range from about 1% for the dilatational resonator system  @xcite to 5 - 6% for flexural resonators  @xcite .",
    "this is about two orders of magnitude smaller than required to create a double - well potential .",
    "suh  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite remark that a factor of 10 increase in @xmath3 should be possible by modifying the geometry",
    ". other types of systems have come closer to achieving the required coupling strength  @xcite , and a number of proposals for reaching or simulating the ultrastrong and deep strong coupling regimes have recently appeared  @xcite .",
    "this is an area of active research , so further advances are to be expected in the near future .",
    "we have derived an approximation for the rabi model in the slow - oscillator regime , @xmath17 , and intermediate coupling strength . as well as giving analytical expressions for the energies and eigenstates of the system in this regime , the approximation allows us to interpret the dynamics of the oscillator and qubit in an intuitive way .",
    "an initially localized state of the oscillator displays dynamics similar to that of a particle tunneling in a double - well potential ; the high - frequency qubit adiabatically follows the oscillator motion , resulting in slow , large - amplitude oscillations of @xmath115 .",
    "this behavior may be interpreted via a semiclassical picture in which the interaction with the qubit creates an effective double - well potential for the oscillator . within this picture ,",
    "the fully quantum approximation presented here gives reasonable estimates for the height of the potential barrier , the number of tunneling states trapped below the barrier , and the tunneling frequency of each pair of states .",
    "we find that the timescales and temperatures required for realization of qubit - mediated oscillator tunneling are within the reach of cutting - edge micro- and nanomechanics experiments ; the only major obstacle is achieving the large coupling strengths required .",
