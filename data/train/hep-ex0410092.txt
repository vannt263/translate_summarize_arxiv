    "the time - dependent @xmath10 asymmetry in a @xmath11 decay of a @xmath12 to a @xmath10 eigenstate allows for a measurement of the angle @xmath13 $ ] if the decay is dominated by the tree amplitude .",
    "the contribution from penguin diagrams gives rise to a correction @xmath14 that can be inferred through an isospin analysis  @xcite .",
    "the recent experimental results  @xcite indicate a small penguin contributions in @xmath15 .",
    "the @xmath10 analysis in @xmath16 is complicated by the presence of three helicity states .",
    "however , the measured polarizations in @xmath17 and @xmath18 modes indicate a dominance of the helicity 0 state ( longitudinal polarization ) , that is a @xmath19 eigenstate . a measurement of the polarization in @xmath5 would complete the isospin triangle , but this mode has not been observed so for .",
    "knowledge of the @xmath5 rate is still expected to be limiting factor to the accuracy of the @xmath8 measurement with @xmath20 decays .    in this paper",
    ", we present a time - dependent analysis of @xmath2 based on a sample of 122 million pairs , and a search for the @xmath21 final state on a sample of 227 million pairs at .",
    "we reconstruct @xmath17 candidates from combinations of two charged tracks and two @xmath22 candidates . in the @xmath21 mode ,",
    "the @xmath12 candidates are reconstructed from their decay products @xmath23 with four charged tracks which are required to originate from a single vertex near the interaction point .",
    "the @xmath22 candidates are formed from pairs of photons that have measured energies greater than 50 mev .",
    "the reconstructed @xmath22 mass must satisfy @xmath24 gev / c@xmath25 .",
    "the mass of the @xmath26 candidates , @xmath27 , must satisfy @xmath28 @xmath29 , and the mass , @xmath30 , must satisfy @xmath31 @xmath29 .",
    "combinatorial backgrounds dominate near @xmath32 , where @xmath33 , @xmath34 , 2 is defined for each @xmath26 meson as the angle between the @xmath22 ( @xmath35 ) momentum in the @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) rest frame and the flight direction of the @xmath12 in this frame , we reduce these backgrounds with the requirement @xmath38 in @xmath17 modes and @xmath39 in @xmath21 mode .",
    "two kinematic variables  @xcite , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , allow the discrimination of signal @xmath1 decays from random combinations of tracks and @xmath22 candidates . for @xmath17",
    "we require that @xmath42 @xmath29 and @xmath43 @xmath29 .",
    "the asymmetric @xmath40 window suppresses background from higher - multiplicity @xmath1 decays .",
    "for @xmath21 we require @xmath44 @xmath29 and @xmath45 @xmath46 .    in order to reject the dominated quark - antiquark continuum background ,",
    "we require @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the the angle between the @xmath1 thrust axis and the thrust axis of the rest of the events ( roe ) .",
    "the other event - shape discriminating variables are combined in a neural network  @xcite ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "the @xmath49s for @xmath17 and @xmath21 analysis weight the discriminating variables differently , according to training on off - resonance data and the relevant mote carlo ( mc ) simulated signal events .    when multiple @xmath1 candidates can be formed we select the one that minimizes the sum of the deviations of the reconstructed @xmath22 mass in @xmath17 mode ,",
    "while , for @xmath21 , one candidate is selected randomly .",
    "the selection efficiency is 7% ( 13% ) for the longitudinaly ( transversely ) polarized @xmath50 signal , and it is 27% ( 32% ) for the @xmath21 signal .",
    "@xmath1 in the event . to study the time - dependent asymmetry one needs to measure the proper time difference , @xmath51 , between the two @xmath1 decays in the events , and to determine the flavor tag of the other @xmath1-meson .",
    "the time difference between the decays of the two neutral @xmath1 mesons ( @xmath52 , @xmath53 ) is calculated from the measured separation @xmath54 between the @xmath55 and @xmath56 decay vertices  @xcite .",
    "the flavor of the @xmath53 is determined with a multivariate technique  @xcite that has a total effective tagging efficiency of ( 28.4@xmath570.7)% .",
    "an unbinned likelihood fit is finally performed on the selected event , a probability density function is built from discriminating variables , including the angular distribution and the @xmath51-dependence .",
    "the signal decay - rate distribution @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) for @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) is given by : @xmath62 , \\label{time}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 is the mean @xmath12 lifetime , @xmath64 is the @xmath65 mixing frequency , and @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the @xmath10 asymmetry parameters for the longitudinal polarized signal .",
    "we measure the @xmath10 violating asymmetries in the @xmath68 longitudinal component decay on 122 million pairs .",
    "a detailed analysis of the background due to other @xmath1 decays is performed . the main systematic uncertainty on the asymmetries is found to be the unknown @xmath10 violation in @xmath1 background events",

    "we have searched for the decay mode @xmath5 , the measured value for the branching fraction is @xmath71 or an upper limit of @xmath7 at 90% confidence level ( c.l . ) .    using the grossman - quinn bound  @xcite with the recent results  @xcite on @xmath72 we limit @xmath73 ( 68% c.l . ) . ignoring possible non - resonant contributions , and @xmath74 amplitudes  @xcite one can relate @xmath10 parameters @xmath66 and @xmath67 to @xmath8 , up to a four - fold ambiguity .",
