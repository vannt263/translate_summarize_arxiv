    "essentially in the unitary limit  @xcite  and for clusters of helium atoms that have a large , but finite , two - body scattering length  @xcite .",
    "both of these systems consist of bosons , whereas the particles that make up nuclei are spin one - half fermions of two different isospins .",
    "this means that  even in the approximation that @xmath13-wave interactions dominate the formation of the three - nucleon bound state@xmath3(nucleon - nucleon ) interactions in two different channels , the @xmath14s@xmath15 and the @xmath16s@xmath17 , contribute to the binding of the three - nucleon system .",
    "nevertheless , the efimov effect also occurs for three nucleons  @xcite : the virtual state in doublet s - wave neutron - deuteron scattering becomes an excited efimov state of the triton in appropriate limits  @xcite .",
    "most recently , kievsky and gattobigio studied the physics of the three - nucleon bound state with model gaussian potentials  @xcite , showing that efimov states appear in the three - nucleon spectrum , either as the @xmath16s@xmath17 scattering length is increased towards the unitary limit , or as the two scattering lengths are taken equal .",
    "they argued that this means the triton is inside the  efimov window \" in that its structure is governed by ` a few control parameters , [ such ] as the two - body energies and scattering lengths ' , i.e. it can be described within the context of few - body universality .    an effective field theory ( eft ) with only short - range interactions provides a systematic way to organize the treatment of three - body states in this universal / efimov - window regime .",

    "the leading - order equations for the triton in this eft were worked out in ref .",
    "@xcite , and it was quickly apparent that those equations are equivalent to the ( single ) equation for bosons  @xcite in the limit that the @xmath16s@xmath17 and @xmath14s@xmath15 scattering lengths are equal , i.e. , if the @xmath3interaction displays a wigner - su(4 ) spin - isopsin symmetry  @xcite .",
    "that equation , known as the stm ( skornyakov - ter - martirosian  @xcite ) equation , must be regulated .",

    "these problems can be removed by adding a three - body force to the eft at leading order  @xcite .",
    "the three - body force prevents thomas collapse  @xcite .",
    "the leading - order eft calculation recovers the prediction of the efimovian spectrum in the unitary limit and also permits straightforward extension of that result to finite scattering lengths  and to finite , and different , @xmath24 and @xmath25 scattering lengths in the nuclear - physics case .",

    "crucially , the lo three - body force in the three - nucleon problem is wigner - su(4 ) symmetric  @xcite  even for the situation where the @xmath24 and @xmath25 channels exhibit a different scattering length ; wigner - su(4)-anti - symmetric three - body forces do not enter the eft until much higher orders in the expansion  @xcite .",

    "most recently , vanasse has shown that the triton point charge radius is well described within eft(@xmath19 ) , obtaining @xmath26  fm at leading order and for nlo and nnlo corrections  @xcite .",
    "the nlo and nnlo results agree with the experimental value of @xmath7 fm  @xcite . while the nlo correction is sizable , the excellent agreement and reasonable convergence pattern support the contention of ref .",

    "in this paper we use eft(@xmath19)to answer the question of how relevant wigner - su(4 ) symmetry is to the physics of both the triton and @xmath16he .",
    "naively the @xmath3system seems far from the wigner - su(4 ) limit : the deuteron binding momentum is 45 mev , while the corresponding scale in the @xmath14s@xmath15 channel , the inverse of the @xmath27 neutron - proton ( @xmath28 ) scattering length , is @xmath29 mev .",
    "thus the parameter that governs wigner - su(4 ) breaking : @xmath30 is not small compared to the average of @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "however , we shall see that an expansion around the wigner - su(4 ) limit , where @xmath33 , converges well .",
    "the triton binding energy changes by only 0.8 mev due to wigner - su(4 ) breaking , and the triton charge radius in the wigner - su(4 ) limit is @xmath4  fm at nlo in eft(@xmath19 ) , quite close to the average of the experimental @xmath5 and @xmath8 point charge radii .",
    "perhaps most tellingly , the wigner - su(4)-odd component of the triton wave function is less than 10% the size of the su(4)-even part , which implies that an expansion around the wigner - su(4 ) limit will be successful for all trinucleon bound - state observables  or at least for all observables that do not vanish in that limit .",
    "wigner - su(4 ) ( spin - isospin ) symmetry has had considerable phenomenological success in nuclear physics , ever since , in 1937 , wigner classified nuclear states according to their su(4 ) representation in order to explain the pattern of nuclear masses up to @xmath34  @xcite .",
    "subsequently he worked out the consequences of such a symmetry for nuclear beta decays  @xcite . the  wigner super - multiplet theory \"",
    "was later applied to inelastic electron scattering from , and muon capture on , @xmath35c and @xmath36o  @xcite ; the particle - hole states were usefully classified according to wigner - su(4 ) , thereby explaining the existence of a family of giant resonances in these nuclei .",
    "we note that the presence of wigner - su(4 ) symmetry in the three - nucleon problem is a weaker condition than that the three - nucleon problem exhibit the unitary ( @xmath11 ) limit .",
    "the unitary limit may be relevant for few - nucleon systems in large magnetic fields  @xcite or in a version of qcd with slightly larger and unequal versions of the up- and down - quark masses  @xcite .",
    "recently , knig _ et al .",
    "_ have argued that the binding energies of the @xmath37 and @xmath38 systems can be understood both qualitatively and quantitatively via an expansion around the unitary limit .",
    "we will comment specifically on this idea in sec .",
    "[ sec : unitary ] . in the wigner - su(4 ) limit the four @xmath3scattering lengths @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 are all equal , but could be finite .",
    "efimovian towers can still occur in such a system ( e.g. the helium trimers ) , but they are related by a scaling factor which is smaller than the 22.7 that applies for equal masses when @xmath11 . in this situation",
    "the equations for the triton are those for a two - neutron halo with a neutron - core scattering length equal to the neutron - neutron scattering length  @xcite .",
    "therefore the wigner - su(4 ) limit not only connects the trinucleons to the three - boson systems being investigated experimentally in innsbruck , frankfurt , and elsewhere , it also permits us to understand the triton as the lightest two - neutron halo .",

    "however , since the construction of any three - nucleon bound - state property in eft(@xmath19)will involve these non - perturbative objects , the fact that they converge rapidly in the @xmath83 expansion suggests that the expansion will generally be successful for three - nucleon bound - state observables .",
    "knig _ et al . _",
    "have recently argued that the binding energies of nuclei up to @xmath38 can be understood in an expansion about the unitary limit , where @xmath182  @xcite .",
    "the unitary limit is clearly a special case of wigner - su(4 ) symmetry ; taking @xmath182 enlarges the symmetry group still further , since the discrete scale invariance of eft(@xmath19)at lo then relates all the unitary - limit efimov states by a fixed rescaling . in the case of finite scattering lengths",
    "the efimov spectrum still possesses discrete scale invariance , but a particular efimov state is related to others at a different @xmath3scattering length  @xcite .",
    "as we have done here , knig _ et al .",
    "_ fix the size of the three - body force to reproduce the binding energy of the physical triton .",
    "they demonstrate that the binding - energy difference of @xmath16he and @xmath16h remains well predicted in the unitary limit ( cf .",
    "they also show that the alpha particle , while overbound by about 10 mev at exact unitarity , attains almost exactly its experimental binding energy ( 28.30 mev ) once first - order corrections in the expansion in @xmath183 are included .",
    "it is straightforward for us to take the limit @xmath184 in our results and so obtain point charge radii for three - nucleon bound states in the unitary limit . at",
    "leading order in the range expansion this gives @xmath185 fm ( for @xmath124 mev ) , in accord with the analytic result  @xcite @xmath186 this lends support to the argument of knig _ et al .",
    "_ , since it is within 10% of either the wigner - su(4 ) limit result quoted above , or the full lo eft(@xmath19)answer of 1.13 fm  @xcite .",
    "adding corrections of first order in the range of the @xmath3interaction corrects the radius obtained from eq .",

    ".anatomy of the point charge radii @xmath194 , of three - nucleon bound states .",
    "when only one number is quoted the radii are equal for @xmath5 and @xmath8 , if two numbers are given the first is for the triton and the second for @xmath8 .",
    "all numbers are in fm .",

    "@xcite , which obtained 1.13 fm at lo in eft(@xmath19 ) , but with wigner - su(4 ) breaking included to all orders in @xmath83 , and 1.59 fm in a calculation that was first order in the ranges ( including su(4 ) breaking therein ) , and again had the physical values of @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "the proximity of our @xmath197 results to these is very striking .",
    "the unitary limit seems a worse starting point  at least for radii  especially since the shift that results from range corrections is significantly underpredicted there .",
    "it may be that radii are more challenging for the expansion proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , since they are quite sensitive to infra - red physics , and the long - distance properties of the three - nucleon system are dramatically different in the unitary limit ( at both lo and nlo in the expansion of ref .",
    "@xcite infinite towers of bound efimov excited states occur ) than they are in reality .",
    "working to @xmath197 in the range and @xmath83 expansion of eft(@xmath19)we obtain a point charge radius for @xmath5 of @xmath6  fm , which agrees with the experimental number , @xmath7  fm  @xcite , within the experimental errors .",
    "it also agrees with the nlo result of @xmath152  fm obtained using the physical values of the @xmath3scattering lengths and triton binding energy  @xcite , within theoretical errors .",
    "it follows that all higher - order corrections in @xmath83 and @xmath198 must conspire to give a total correction of only @xmath199  fm to @xmath200 . naively @xmath122 corrections could give 5% of the lo wigner su(4)-symmetric charge radius @xmath148  fm , i.e. , they should be @xmath201  fm .",
    "however , at @xmath122 there will be effects both from expanding the expressions of ref .",
    "@xcite out to @xmath161 , and from the @xmath161 shift of the three - nucleon bound state energy from @xmath124  mev to the physical triton binding energy .",
    "the small overall result of a @xmath199  fm shift is probably due to a cancellation between these two classes of @xmath161 corrections .",
    "working to first order in both wigner - su(4 ) breaking and the @xmath3effective range produces a @xmath8 point charge radius of @xmath9  fm , about 4% below the experimental value of @xmath202  fm  @xcite .",
    "the difference is mostly from missing coulomb and higher - order range corrections , since the @xmath8 charge radius with wigner su(4)-breaking included to all orders ( including breaking in ranges ) , but no coulomb effects , is @xmath203  fm at nlo in the range expansion  @xcite .    in this ( isospin symmetric ) limit @xmath5 and",
    "@xmath8 have a common binding energy .",
    "it is thus an su(4 ) scalar , and so receives no correction at @xmath123 .",
    "we find that @xmath161 effects make the triton 11% less bound in the wigner - su(4 ) limit than it is at the physical value , @xmath204  mev .",
    "@xmath83 is in fact larger than @xmath205 mev , and so the rapid convergence of the expansion in powers of @xmath83 at first glance is somewhat mysterious .",
    "however , the expansion is really an expansion in powers of @xmath206 , with @xmath207 the eft(@xmath19)propagator for the @xmath3system that appears in the three - body equations .",
    "this renders the expansion around the su(4 ) limit one in @xmath208 , with @xmath209 mev the binding momentum of the triton .",
    "examining both the three - nucleon binding energy and the relative size of the su(4)-symmetric and su(4)-anti - symmetric pieces of the three - nucleon vertex function , @xmath210 , suggests that the error induced in observables through going to the wigner - su(4 ) limit will be at most 10% .",
    "this implies that an efficient way to account for wigner - su(4 ) breaking is to equate @xmath211 , i.e. only compute one correction in wigner - su(4 ) breaking for every two orders in the range expansion .",
    "unfortunately , an @xmath212 calculation requires a new three - body force that must be renormalized to a three - body datum  @xcite . since the wigner - su(4 )",
    "limit is not expected to work nearly as well for scattering observables that additional three - body force should be fit to a three - body bound state observable .",
    "we postpone this to future work .",
    "finally , we note that the wigner - su(4 ) symmetry which emerges in eft(@xmath19)is not obviously related to the contracted su(4 ) of qcd in the limit of a large number of colors ( @xmath213 )  @xcite . in the large-@xmath213limit wigner - su(4 ) symmetry of nuclear forces naturally emerges  @xcite , but this happens only at a renormalization scale @xmath214 , whereas the su(4 ) in eft(@xmath19)emerges already for renormalization scales @xmath215 .",
    "in order to prove eq .",
    "( [ eq : linchpin ] ) the spatial permutation operator is defined as @xmath216 .",
    "this operator permutes the @xmath217th and @xmath218th particles in the spatial part of the wavefunction while leaving the spin and isospin parts of the wavefunction untouched . noting @xmath219 gives @xmath220 where @xmath221 , @xmath222 , and @xmath223 . in the wigner",
    "su(4)-limit the spatial part of the tri - nucleon wavefunction is spatially symmetric since it is equivalent to that of three bosons , and is thus invariant under any spatial permutation .",
    "now , since the spatial permutation operator does not act on isospin it can be commuted with @xmath224 , leading to @xmath225 which reduces finally to @xmath226        e.  braaten and h.  w. hammer , phys .",
