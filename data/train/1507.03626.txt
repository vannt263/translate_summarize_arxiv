    "for such intensities the electron - wave field energy exchange over a x - ray wavelength is larger than the photon energy , and the laser - matter interaction has essentially multiphoton character @xcite .",
    "thus , in recent decade the wide research field is opened up , where common nonlinear effects are extended to high energy transitions for various systems - from atoms @xcite , through molecules xm1,xm2,xm3,xm4 , to plasma and solid samples xps1,xps2,xps3,xps4,xps5,xps6 . among the fundamental processes of laser - plasma interaction ,",
    "the inverse bremsstrahlung absorption of an intense laser field in plasma is one of the contemporary problems that have applications ranging from plasma diagnostics to thermonuclear reactions and generation of intense x - ray radiation .",
    "note that in the field of intense x - ray laser , an electron may gain considerable energies absorbing even of a few quanta , which makes it as an effective mechanism for laser - plasma heating .",
    "the theoretical description of this phenomenon in such superstrong radiation fields requires one to go beyond the scope of common quantum electrodynamics -feynman diagrams corresponding to the perturbation theory .    with the advent of lasers",
    "many pioneering papers have been devoted to the theoretical investigation of the electron - ion scattering processes in gas or plasma in the presence of a laser field using nonrelativistic csb1,qsb1,csb2,bornnr1,lf1,csb3,cbs33,cbs333,bunk , eik1,lf2,qsb2 as well as relativistic @xcite considerations .",
