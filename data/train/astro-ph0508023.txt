    "the gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) measured with the batse instrument on the compton gamma - ray observatory are usually characterized by 9 observational quantities ( 2 durations , 4 fluences , 3 peak fluxes ) @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in a previous paper @xcite",
    "we have shown that these 9 quantities can be reduced to only two significant independent variables ( principal components ) . here",
    "we present a new statistical analysis of the correlation between these variables and show that there is a significant difference between the power law exponents of long and short bursts .",
    "the details of this analysis will be presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we consider here those grbs from the current batse gamma - ray burst catalog @xcite which have measured @xmath0 durations and fluences ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "therefore , we are left with @xmath2 grbs , all of which have defined @xmath0 and @xmath3 ) , as well as peak fluxes @xmath4 .",
    "the distribution of the log@xmath0 clearly displays two peaks reflecting the existence of two groups of grbs @xcite .",
    "this bimodal distribution can be fitted by two log - normal distributions @xcite .",
    "the fact that the distribution of @xmath0 within a subclass is log - normal has important consequences .",
    "let us denote the observed duration of a grb with @xmath0 ( which may be subject to cosmological time dilatation ) and with @xmath5 those measured by a comoving observer ( intrinsic duration ) .",
    "then one has @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the redshift , and @xmath8 measures the time dilatation . for the concrete form of @xmath8 one can take @xmath9 , where @xmath10 or @xmath11 , depending on whether energy stretching is included or not .",
    "taking the logarithms of both sides of this equality one obtains the logarithmic duration as a sum of two independent stochastic variables . according to a theorem of cramr @xcite , if a variable @xmath12 , which has a gaussian distribution , is given by a sum of two independent variables , i.e. @xmath13 , then both @xmath14 and @xmath15 have gaussian distributions .",
    "therefore , from this theorem it follows that the gaussian distributions of @xmath16 , confirmed for the two subclasses separately @xcite , implies the same type of distribution for the variables of @xmath17 and of @xmath18 . however , unless the space - time geometry has a very particular structure , the distribution of @xmath18 can not be gaussian .",
    "this means that the gaussian nature of the distribution of @xmath16 must be dominated by the distribution of @xmath17 , and the latter must then necessarily have a gaussian distribution .",
    "this holds for both duration subgroups separately .",
    "( note here that several other authors , e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , have already suggested , that the distribution of @xmath0 reflects predominantly the distribution of @xmath5 . )",
    "one also has @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the luminosity distance , and @xmath21 is the total emitted energy . once there is a log - normal distribution for @xmath22 ( for the two subgroups separately ) , then the previous application of cramr theorem is also possible here .",
    "the existence of this log - normal distribution is not obvious , but may be shown as follows .",
    "assume both the short and the long groups have distributions of the variables @xmath0 and @xmath22 which are log - normal . in this case",
    ", it is possible to fit _ simultaneously _ the values of @xmath23 and @xmath16 by a single two - dimensional ( `` bivariate '' ) normal distribution .",
    "this distribution has five parameters ( two means , two dispersions , and the angle ( @xmath24 ) between the axis @xmath16 and the semi - major axis of the  dispersion ellipse \" ) .",
    "its standard form can be seen in @xcite ( chapt .",
    "when the @xmath25-correlation coefficient differs from zero , then the semi - major axis of the dispersion ellipse represents a linear relationship between @xmath16 and @xmath23 with a slope of @xmath26 .",
    "this linear relationship between the logarithmic variables implies a power law relation of form @xmath27 between the fluence and the duration , where @xmath28 may be different for the two subgroups .",
    "then a similar relation will exist between @xmath5 and @xmath21 .",
    "we obtain the best fit through a maximum likelihood estimation ( e.g. , @xcite , vol.2 . , p.57 - 58 ) . from this estimation",
    "we obtain the dependence of the total emitted on the intrinsic duration in form @xmath29    several papers discuss the biases in the batse values of @xmath22 and @xmath0 ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "all types of biases are particularly essential for faint grbs . to discuss these effects",
    "we provide several different additional calculations ( for more details see @xcite ) , which give the same results .",
    "the exponent in the power laws differ significantly for the two subclasses of short ( @xmath30 s ) and long ( @xmath31 s ) bursts .",
    "these new results may indicate that two different types of central engines are at work , or perhaps two different types of progenitor systems are involved . while the nature of the progenitors remains so far indeterminate , our results indicate strongly that the nature of the energy release process giving rise to the bursts is different between the two burst classes . in the short ones the total energy released is proportional to the duration , while in the long ones it is proportional roughly to the square of the duration .",
    "this result is completely model - independent , and provides an interesting constraint on the two types of bursts .",
