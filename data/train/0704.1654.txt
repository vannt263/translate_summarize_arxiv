    "dark energy has challenged our knowledge of fundamental physics since the direct evidence for its existence was discovered using type ia supernovae @xcite . because there are currently no compelling theoretical explanations for dark energy , the correct emphasis , as pointed out by the dark energy task force ( detf , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is on refining our observations of the accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "recommendation v from the detf report @xcite calls for an exploration of the systematic effects that could impair the needed observational refinements .",
    "a couple of recent studies @xcite point out that the redshift lever arm needed to accurately measure the universal expansion requires the use of a local sample , but that coherent large - scale local ( @xmath15 ) peculiar velocities add additional uncertainty to the hubble diagram and hence to the derived cosmological parameters .",
    "current analyses of the cosmological parameters do not attempt to correct for the effect of local peculiar velocities .",
    "as briefly noted by @xcite and @xcite , it is possible to use local data to measure the local velocity field and hence limit the impact on the derived cosmological parameters .",
    "measurements of the local velocity field have improved to the point where there is consistency among surveys and methods @xcite .",
    "type ia supernova peculiar velocities have been studied recently by @xcite and others .",
    "their results demonstrate that the local flows derived from sne are in agreement with those derived from other distance indicators , such as the tully - fisher relation and the fundamental plane .",
    "our aim is to use the current knowledge of the local peculiar motions to correct local sne and , together with a homogeneous set of distant sne , fit for cosmological parameters and measure the effect of the corrections on the cosmological fits .    to produce this measurement",
    ", we analyze the local and distant sn  ia sample used in the first - year cosmology results from the supernova legacy survey .",
    "this sample is composed of 44 local sne ( a06 , table  8 : * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and 71 distant sne ( a06 , table  9 ) .",
    "the distant sne are the largest homogeneous set currently in the literature .",
    "the local sample span the redshift range @xmath16 and were selected to have good lightcurve sampling ( a06 ,   5.2 ) . using three different models encompassing the range of plausible local large - scale flow , we assign and correct for the peculiar velocity of each local sn .",
    "we then re - fit the entire sample for @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 to assess the systematics due to the peculiar velocity field , and to asses the change in the quality of the resulting fits .",
    "peculiar velocities , @xmath17 , arise due to inhomogeneities in the mass density and hence in the expansion .",
    "their effect is to perturb the observed redshifts from their cosmological values : @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the cosmological redshift the sn would have in the absence of peculiar velocities . with the advent of all - sky galaxy redshift surveys , it is possible to predict peculiar velocities from the galaxy distribution provided one knows @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is a linear biasing parameter relating fluctuations in the galaxy density , @xmath22 , to fluctuations in the mass density . the peculiar velocity in the cmb frame is then given by linear perturbation theory @xcite applied to the density field ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath23    in this letter , we use the density field of iras pscz galaxies @xcite , which extends to a depth @xmath24 .",
    "contributions to the peculiar velocity arising from masses on scales larger than @xmath25 are modeled by a simple residual dipole , @xmath26 .",
    "thus , given a density field , the parameters @xmath27 and @xmath26 describe the velocity field within @xmath25 .",
    "for galaxies with distances greater than @xmath25 , the first term above is set to zero .    the predicted peculiar velocities from the pscz density field",
    "are subject to two sources of uncertainty : the noisiness of the predictions due to the sparsely - sampled density field , and the inapplicability of linear perturbation theory on small scales .",
    "typically these uncertainties are accounted for by adding an additional `` thermal '' dispersion , which is assumed to be gaussian . from a careful analysis of predicted and",
    "observed peculiar velocities , @xcite estimated these uncertainties to be @xmath28 , albeit with a dependence on density .",
    "@xcite found reasonable @xmath5 values if 150  was assumed in the field , with an extra contribution to the small - scale dispersion added in quadrature for sne in clusters .",
    "here we adopt a thermal dispersion of 150 .    for this study , we explore the results of three different models of large - scale flows and compare them to a case where no flow model is used .",
    "these models have been chosen to span the range of flow models permitted by peculiar velocity data , and all of these models reproduce the observed @xmath29 600 km s@xmath30 motion of the local group with respect to the cmb .",
    "the first model assumes a pure bulk flow ( model pbf , hence @xmath31 ) with @xmath26 having vector components @xmath32 km s@xmath30 in galactic cartesian coordinates .",
    "the second model assumes @xmath6 ( model b05 ) , with a dipole vector of @xmath33 km s@xmath30 .",
    "the third model adopts @xmath34 ( model b07 ) which requires no residual dipole .",
    "we compare these models to the no - correction scenario adopted by a06 and others with @xmath31 , @xmath35 which we call the `` no flow '' or nf scenario .",
    "note that a recent comparison @xcite of results from iras predictions versus peculiar velocity data yields a mean value fit with @xmath36 ( stat ) , so the b05 model is strongly favored over the nf scenario by independent peculiar velocity analyses .",
    "prior to the fitting procedure , the peculiar velocities for each model are used to correct the local sne ( using a variation of * ? ? ?",
    "* equations 11 and 13 ) .",
    "we then fit our corrected sn data in two ways using a @xmath5-gridding cosmology fitter ( also used by * ? ? ?",
    "the first fit uses a flat cosmology ( @xmath37 ) with the equation of state parameter @xmath1 and @xmath2 as free parameters .",
    "the second fit assumes a @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) cosmology with @xmath3 and @xmath2 as free parameters .",
    "we used the same intrinsic sn photometric scatter ( @xmath40 mag , a06 ) for every fit .",
    "the resulting @xmath5 probability surfaces for both fits are then further constrained using the bao result from @xcite .",
    "the final derived cosmological parameters are then used to calculate the @xmath5 for each fit ( see a06 , ",
    "the fitting procedure employed here differs in implementation from that used in a06 .",
    "three additional parameters , often called nuisance parameters , must be fit along with the two cosmological parameters .",
    "these parameters are the constant of proportionality for the sn lightcurve shape , @xmath41 , the correction for the sn observed color , @xmath42 , and a sn brightness normalization , @xmath43 .",
    "we distinguish @xmath42 from the @xmath27 used to describe the flow models above .",
    "a06 used analytic marginalization of the nuisance parameters @xmath41 and @xmath42 in their fits . here",
    "these parameters are fully gridded like the cosmological parameters .",
    "this avoids a bias in the nuisance parameters that results because , in the analytic method , their values must be held fixed to compute the errors .",
    "the result is that our fits using the nf scenario produces slightly different cosmological parameters than quoted in a06 .",

    "they demonstrate two effects of the peculiar velocity corrections : a change in the values of the cosmological parameters , and a change in the quality of the fits as measured by the @xmath5 statistic .    , @xmath2 fit ( @xmath37 + bao prior ) for each of the four peculiar velocity models in table  [ tab_models ] .",
    "the values for the nf scenario are indicted by the dashed lines . the largest systematic error in @xmath1 compared with the nf fit is @xmath64 for the b07 model , which demonstrates the amplitude of the systematic error if peculiar velocity is not accounted for .",
    "the offsets for @xmath2 are all within @xmath65 showing that this parameter is not sensitive to the peculiar velocity corrections due to the bao prior .",
    "the @xmath5 of the fits improve when using the two @xmath27 models ( b05 , b07 ) , while the pbf model provides a significantly worse fit . ]    , @xmath2 fit ( @xmath66 + bao prior ) for each of the four peculiar velocity models as in figure  [ fig_wom_fit ] .",
    "again , comparing the nf fits to the b07 model produces the largest systematic in @xmath3 of @xmath67 .",
    "we also find @xmath2 insensitive to the corrections , having all offsets within @xmath68 .",
    "the @xmath5 values show the same pattern as in figure  [ fig_wom_fit ] , favoring the @xmath27 models over no correction ( nf ) , and over pure bulk flow . ]",
    "we expect , if a given model is correct , to improve the fitting since our corrected data should more closely resemble the homogeneous universe described by a few cosmological parameters .",
    "the @xmath5 of the fits for each flow model can be compared to the @xmath5 for the nf scenario ( shown by the dashed line in the figures ) as a test of this hypothesis . using @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the likelihood , we find that the pure bulk flow is over 10@xmath71 times less likely than the nf scenario , while the b05 and b07 models are 13.5 and 8.6 times more likely , respectively .",
    "we also use these data to assess the systematic errors made in the parameters if no peculiar velocities are accounted for .",
    "the largest of these are obtained by comparing the b07 model with the nf scenario .",
    "this comparison yields @xmath72 and @xmath73 . the same comparison for the b05 model , which is only slightly preferred by the @xmath5 statistic over model b07 , produces @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the systematic offsets for @xmath2 are all @xmath76 or less , demonstrating the insensitivity of this parameter to peculiar velocities .",
    "this is due to the bao prior which is insensitive to local flow and provides a much stronger constraint for @xmath2 than for @xmath1 or @xmath3 ( see a06 , figures  5 and 6 ) .",
    "the systematic effect of different flow models is at the level of @xmath77 in @xmath1 . this is smaller than the _ present _ level of random error in @xmath1 , which is largely due to the small numbers of high- and low - redshift sne .",
    "however , compared to other systematics discussed in a06 , which total @xmath78 , the systematic effect of large - scale flows is important .",
    "* table 5 ) list 16 sources of systematic error which total @xmath79 . aside from three method - dependent systematics and the photometric zero - point error ,",
    "they are all smaller than the flow systematic .",
    "as the number of sne continues to increase , and understanding of other systematics ( e.g. photometric zero - points ) improves , it is possible that large - scale flows will become one of the dominant sources of systematic uncertainty .",
    "the peculiar velocities of sn host galaxies arise from large - scale structures over a range of scales .",
    "the component arising from small - scale , local structure is the least important : it is essentially a random variable which is reduced by @xmath80 .",
    "more problematic is the large - scale coherent component .",
    "such a large - scale component can take several forms : an overdensity or underdensity ; a large - scale dipole , or `` bulk '' flow .",
    "the existence of a large - scale , but local ( @xmath81 ) underdensity , or `` hubble bubble '' was first discussed by @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite have re - enforced this claim with a larger sn data set : they find that the difference in the hubble constant inside the bubble and outside is @xmath82 .",
    "if correct , this could have a dramatic effect on the derived cosmological parameters ( * ? ? ?",
    "* fig 17 ) , especially for those studies that extend their local sample down below @xmath83 .",
    "however , the `` hubble bubble '' was not confirmed by @xcite who found @xmath84% using the tully - fisher ( tf ) peculiar velocities , nor by @xcite who found @xmath85 using the fundamental plane ( fp ) distances .    according to equation  [ eq_pvel ] , a mean underdensity of iras galaxies of order @xmath29 40% within 7400",
    "would be needed to generate the `` hubble bubble '' quoted by @xcite .",
    "however , we find that the iras pscz density field of @xcite is not underdense in this distance range ; instead it is mildly overdense ( by a few percent ) within 7400  ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 2 ) . as a further cross - check ,",
    "when we refit the @xcite data after having subtracted the predictions of the b05 flow model , the `` bubble '' remains in the @xcite data .",
    "thus , the jha et al `` bubble '' can not be explained by local structure , unless that structure is not traced by iras galaxies .",
    "moreover , when we analyze the 99 sne within 15000  from @xcite in the same way , we find no evidence of a significant `` hubble bubble '' ( @xmath86% ) , in agreement with the results from tf and fp surveys . the @xcite sample and that of @xcite have 67 sne in common .",
    "the high degree of overlap suggests that the difference lies in the different methods for converting the photometry into sn distance moduli .",
    "a local large - scale flow can also introduce systematic errors if the low - z sample is biased in its sky coverage : in this case , an uncorrected dipole term can corrupt the monopole term , which then biases the cosmological parameters . for the large - scale flow directions considered here , this does not appear to affect the a06 sample : we note that the pbf - corrected case has similar cosmological parameters to the `` no flow '' case .",
    "however , if coherent flows exist on large scales , this may affect surveys with unbalanced sky coverage , such as the sn factory @xcite or the sdss sn survey .",
    "the most promising approach to treating the effect of large - scale flows is a more sophisticated version of the analysis presented here : combine low - redshift sne with other low - redshift peculiar velocity tracers , such as tully - fisher sfi++ survey @xcite and the noao fundamental plane survey @xcite , and use these data to constrain the parameters of the flow model ( @xmath27 and the residual large - scale flow @xmath26 ) directly .",
    "one can then marginalize over the parameters of the flow model while fitting the cosmological parameters to the low- and high-@xmath87 sne .        ,",
