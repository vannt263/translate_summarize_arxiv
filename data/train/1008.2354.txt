    "the subtleties of galaxy formation remain to be understood . the study of the internal structure of galaxies can help us to understand how they formed and evolved . here",
    "we study the internal colour variation across galaxies , quantified through their colour gradient .",
    "interest in internal colour variation has grown enormously in the last five years , especially due to the availability of both shallow large surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , that can provide statistically significant samples of galaxies , and deep surveys , that provide high resolution images of galaxies at @xmath4 , such as those performed with the hubble space telescope ( hst ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "previous work has used the colour gradient as a measure of the galactic internal colour variation , which has proved to be very useful for exploring galactic properties , due to its tight dependency on the galactic distribution of metallicity , stellar age and dust ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this , together with the accessibility of gradient measurements , since only photometry is needed , makes the colour gradient a useful tool to obtain statistical results for wide samples of galaxies , that will be interesting to relate to different theoretical aspects from models of galaxy formation .    in general , galaxies tend to have cores that are redder than their external parts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in this work we study the variation within nearby galaxies of the following optical colours : @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 . both @xmath6 and @xmath5 rest frame colours",
    "are most sensitive to the intensity of the spectral break that appears around @xmath10  , due to the accumulation of resonant absorption lines from metals in different stages of ionisation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this break correlates with the temperature of the dominant stellar population , increasing for cooler stars , but it does not depend strongly on the galactic metallicity . unlike late - type galaxies , early - type ones are dominated by k - type stars , showing a rather steep change in flux from g to r or i - band .",
    "if we consider that these colours are mainly related to the age of the galaxy then the redder core will imply that it is also older .",
    "the other three colours , @xmath7 , @xmath9 and @xmath8 , in the rest frame directly depend on the proportion of main sequence to red giant branch or older stars @xcite .",
    "thus , we could simply record these colours as depending on the relative amount of old and young stars in the galaxies , though this is less clear for @xmath8 and has a smaller dynamic range in the case of the @xmath7 colour .",
    "thus , we observe the same tendency as before : redder cores imply that in general galaxies tend to have older stars in their centres .",
    "however , these implications should be taken with caution for two main reasons : i ) global colours can be affected by marginal young populations @xcite .",
    "ii ) colours within different galactic annuli do not necessarily agree well with global ones .",
    "besides , broad band colours show a degeneracy in their dependence with stellar population age and metallicity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . indeed , several studies ( see e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have shown that metallicity and not age gradients are the principal origin of the colour variation . in the case of early - type galaxies , age gradients have been measured to be almost flat or positive while metallicity gradients are negative , i.e. early - type galaxies tend to have younger , higher metallicity cores ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "late - types galaxies are more complex , showing a broad variety of age and also metallicity gradients , due to the interplay between dust content , stellar feedback , bursts of formation and stellar migration due to the instabilities that trigger the formation of bars but also the spiral arms .",
    "@xcite observed that spiral galaxies have bulges with positive age gradients , while their disks show negative ones , but there are examples of spiral galaxies with negative age gradients for most of their extension , except for the most external radii @xcite .",
    "metallicity gradients within galaxies can be produced through different mechanisms .",
    "winds generated by supernovae @xcite or active galactic nuclei ( agn ) @xcite can provide the metallicity enrichment of the inter stellar or even the inter galactic medium .",
    "due to the multiple phases that compose this medium the enrichment does not necessary happen in a symmetrical way , which can produce strong metallicity gradients and thus colour gradients .",
    "galaxies with a significant age gradient can present very shallow or even inverted colour gradients @xcite , since age gradients usually arise from localised regions of star formation , generally resulting in galaxies with bluer cores than their external parts .",
    "the presence of a diffuse component of dust could also explain some colour gradients .",
    "however , this has a marginal impact , specially for early - type galaxies , which are almost dust free @xcite . in summary ,",
    "colour gradients in galaxies are likely to be related to the different star formation histories followed , which depend on the way gas is distributed and collapses after accretion and mergers .",
    "many studies of colour gradients try to clarify the dependence on the star formation history of galaxies .",
    "this aspect is of particular interest since it could help us to understand how galaxies form and evolve .",
    "the recent study by @xcite of early - type galaxies drawn from the sdss dr6 reports a tight correlation between the existence of steep colour gradients and ongoing residual star formation .",
    "this study of galaxies at @xmath11 suggests a relation between elliptical galaxies with bluer cores presenting global bluer colours than average .",
    "@xcite found the same relation for spheroidal galaxies observed by the hst at @xmath12 .",
    "@xcite found that steeper colour gradients appear within star forming galaxies , in both late and early - types .",
    "a similar result was found in the recent study by @xcite , where older galaxies are observed to have systematically shallower age and metallicity gradients , and thus , colour gradients .",
    "the colour gradients of spiral galaxies appear to be dominated by the fact that , on average , their bulges are redder than their disks",
    ". however , this is an oversimplification for many late - type galaxies ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "cosmological simulations do not yet have sufficient resolution to make predictions for colour gradients .",
    "however , semi - analytical models which include a bulge - disk decomposition and spatially resolved star formation , could provide some useful insight for this particular problem @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in general , gas - dynamical simulations with high enough resolution to follow physical processes within galaxies are needed in order to produce theoretical predictions for the internal characteristics of galaxies .",
    "`` monolithic collapse '' models can produce elliptical galaxies with colour gradients that agree with observations if a certain scatter is allowed for the star formation efficiency @xcite .",
    "these monolithic models also predict steeper gradients for more massive galaxies , something that is observed up to @xmath13 @xcite . for more massive galaxies ,",
    "the contribution of mergers provides a larger scatter that smears out such correlation .",
    "@xcite used chemo - dynamical simulations of merging galaxies to understand elliptical galaxy formation .",
    "the resultant galaxies had metallicity gradients consistent with observations .",
    "the predicted gradients depend strongly on the relative properties of the progenitor galaxies , i.e. , on the particular formation process of a galaxy .    in this paper , we study the largest data set to date , which allows us to make a statistically robust analysis of the internal colour variation within nearby galaxies .",
    "we study four luminosity - threshold samples , defined in section  [ sec : dr7sample ] .",
    "we obtain colour gradients directly from the sdss photometric data and we ( k+e ) correct global magnitudes using spectral energy distributions ( seds ) generated with pegase @xcite .",
    "this process is described in section  [ sec : k+e_cor ] . in section  [ sec : results ] we analyse the colour gradients distribution and we also study the possible correlations between the colour gradient and global galactic properties , including galactic types and redshift .",
    "finally we summarise our results and conclusions in section ",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in this study we use petrosian magnitudes for setting the sample limits .",
    "apparent magnitudes are corrected from the extinction due to our galaxy , but not to their internal reddening .",
    "model magnitudes are used only for global galactic colours .",
    "all magnitudes used in this paper are in the ab system , unless otherwise specified .",
    "we assume a flat cosmology , @xmath14 , with a critical matter density of @xmath15 and a hubble constant , @xmath16 with @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "our sample is drawn from the sdss dr7 @xcite spectroscopic main galaxy targets .",
    "the sdss dr7 has covered spectroscopically an area of @xmath18 , providing a redshift accuracy of @xmath19 rms for the main galaxy sample .",
    "the sdss main spectroscopic sample is described by @xcite .",
    "galaxies within this sample have @xmath20 ( petrosian magnitude after correcting for galactic extinction ) and a median redshift of @xmath21 .    from the sdss main spectroscopic sample ,",
    "we further select those galaxies that , according to the sdss pipeline flags , have a reliable determination of their redshift , a good photometry level , with all their pixels checked for possible flux peaks , not being a blended object , without too many interpolated pixels , without pixels hit by a cosmic ray and without a faulty sky subtraction . ] in all g , r , i and z bands , have a good determination of their petrosian radius and a complete surface brightness profile measurement . in order to avoid those galaxies most affected by aperture effects ,",
    "a lower limit to the galaxy redshift has been imposed , @xmath22 .    after applying the above restrictions we found that one of the galaxies appeared multiple times due to different deblending of objects at successive scans . after taking out this galaxy",
    "our initial sample contains @xmath23 galaxies .    as it will be detailed in ",
    "[ sec : howgrad ] we quantify the internal colour variation using the sdss dr7 measurements of surface brightness averaged within circular concentric annuli .",
    "at most there are @xmath24 measurements , though , in most cases there are less due to the low surface brightness of many galaxies .",
    "the outer radii of these annuli are fixed and range from @xmath25 to @xmath26 arcsec , growing approximately exponentiallyrhl / photomisc / profiles.ps ] .",
    "we make use of the stellar masses , star formation rates , some spectral indices and classification provided in the sdss mpa / jhu collaboration database @xcite , which has been updated for the sdss dr7 .",
    "these parameters are obtained by extrapolating to the full galaxy the spectroscopic information collected within the @xmath27 arcsec diameter fibre set around the galactic centres .",
    "the extrapolation is done taking into account the global galactic colour and the effects due to dust .",
    "this extrapolation does not consider the colour gradients within galaxies , which could include a systematic effect on the determination of global properties .",
    "the ( k+e)-correction accounts for two effects .",
    "one , the k - correction , is the shift of the filter in the galaxy s rest frame with redshift due to observing with a fixed band @xcite . the other , the e - correction , accounts for the change in luminosity due to ageing of existing stellar populations or new star formation that galaxies experience up to a reference redshift , generally @xmath28 as in our case , from the epoch at which they are observed @xcite .",
    "both effects vary between the different bands . within the sdss bands we obtain larger corrections for bluer bands @xcite . in order to make sure that we are comparing similar spectral regions from different galaxies we need to apply the ( k+e)-correction .    the ( k+e)-correction is evaluated fitting the galaxy photometry to the best model within a grid of seds generated with the population synthesis models pegase @xcite .",
    "the grid is made using the default template seds produced within pegase , matching the colours observed for different hubble galactic types at @xmath29 , and includes a galaxy formed in a @xmath30 long burst , an elliptical and a lenticular galaxies , spiral galaxies : sa , sb , sbc , sc , sd and three irregular galaxies with different formation redshifts .",
    "there are six galaxies in our initial sample with colours that are not well fitted by the synthetic ones .",
    "these are left out of the sample .",
    "since these objects represent @xmath31% of the sample we do not apply any correction for their omission .    both k and ( k+e ) corrections",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kcor ] for all galaxies in our initial sample .",
    "these corrections are applied to the global colours of galaxies in our sample .",
    "the k - correction alone tends to be larger for higher redshifts , but the dispersion increases at the same time .",
    "this behaviour has been found in other works ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we can observe in fig .",
    "[ fig : kcor ] that the ( k+e)-correction shows a weaker dependency on redshift than the k - correction .",
    "this was also found in previous studies , such as @xcite .",
    "the reason for this flattening is that as galaxies evolve , their luminosity decreases until a new burst of star formation occurs , being superimposed to an already old stellar population .",
    "we checked the possibility of calculating the ( k+e)-correction individually for different galactic radii .",
    "for this purpose , we obtained magnitudes in circular concentric annuli for each galaxy , from the averaged surface brightness measured by the sdss pipelines .",
    "however , colours in individual annuli are noisier than global ones and the fitting procedure basically fits noisy features that result in obtaining unrealistic seds for each annulus .",
    "therefore , we obtain the global ( k+e)-correction for each galaxy , which presumably is an average of the correction to different annuli . the use of an average ( k+e)-correction could introduce spurious colour gradients .",
    "these are difficult to evaluate , since they depend on the intrinsic metallicity and age gradients of each galaxy , higher signal - to - noise data would be needed to properly compute these corrections as a function of radius and evaluate the effect of observing different radii at a given projected annulus . applying a global corrections",
    "implies that the resultant colour gradients would not be affected , since we are only moving the zero point on the colour vs. radius relation .",
    "this implies that similar colour gradients will be found either applying the ( k+e)-correction or only the k - correction .",
    "however , applying one or the other changes very slightly the defined luminosity - threshold samples , and has a definite impact on the global colours associated to each galaxy .",
    "we will restrict our study to galaxies seen up to such a redshift that the ( k+e)-corrections would not be large . rather than the actual value of the ( k+e)-correction , the problem resides in the higher spread among template seds found at higher redshifts , which can introduce larger errors in the estimated correction .",
    "for the majority of galaxies up to @xmath32 , the ( k+e)-corrections is well below a value of @xmath33 in the g , r , i and z - bands .",
    "for the same range , the k - correction stays below @xmath34 in all bands .",
    "there is another reason for not considering galaxies at the highest redshifts covered by the survey . while the distribution of the k - correction is smooth , it is clear that our estimate of the ( k+e)-correction start to be almost discretised for galaxies with @xmath35",
    "this effect is not present at @xmath32 . in order to correct galaxies at @xmath36",
    "we need to enhance our grid of model seds , including different formation redshifts for not only irregular galaxies but for all the hubble types included as templates .",
    "this change should be done carefully , in order to reproduce the observed fluxes of galaxies at different evolutionary stages .    taking into account the two mentioned sources of uncertainty we will restrict our study to galaxies with @xmath32 .",
    ".the given name , absolute magnitude range , redshift range and final number of galaxies to be studied within the defined luminosity - threshold samples . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]         we have divided our initial sample of galaxies with @xmath32 into four luminosity - threshold samples .",
    "these samples , though well defined , are not volume limited since they miss a cut in redshift corresponding to the bright limit of the survey . fig .",
    "[ fig : sample ] shows the boundaries of each sample superimposed on the distribution of the absolute magnitude versus redshift for all galaxies .",
    "absolute magnitudes have been obtained from the ( k+e)-corrected petrosian magnitudes in the r - band .",
    "table [ tab : sample ] summarises the characteristics of the luminosity - threshold samples",
    ". we will refer to each sample by their absolute magnitude cut , as indicated in the first column of table [ tab : sample ] .",
    "we find that some of the galaxies within the _ s21 _ sample have a half light radius @xmath37 arcsec , i.e. , inside the first two annuli with surface brightness measurements . as explained in ",
    "[ sec : howgrad ] these two annuli are not considered in the calculation of the colour gradients .",
    "thus , for those galaxies within the _ s21 _ sample we will be calculating colour gradients with only the outer half of the galactic light .",
    "for this reason , we will concentrate on the other three samples at @xmath38 , and results from the _ s21 _ sample will be considered with caution .    as explained in the next section ",
    "[ sec : howgrad ] , to obtain colour gradients , galaxies should have their surface brightness measured in at least four annuli , without considering the two innermost ones . among our samples",
    "we find two galaxies which have their surface brightness measured in too few annuli , one within the sample _",
    "s20.5 _ and the other within the _ s19 _ one .",
    "these two galaxies lack a colour gradient measurement and are not considered further .    as mentioned previously , we make use of some of the quantities derived from the sdss database by the mpa / jhu collaboration .",
    "the cross identification using the position coordinates of the galaxies is not perfect .",
    "fewer than @xmath2% of the galaxies in our initial samples do not appear to have properties measured by the mpa / jhu collaboration .",
    "only when using the mpa / jhu derived parameters we will be neglecting those galaxies .",
    "different ways to compute the internal colour variation can be found in the literature .",
    "some examples are : the slope of colour vs. normalised radius or its logarithm ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the difference between colours outside and inside certain radius ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the comparison between model and fibre colours when working with galaxies from the sdss ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the colour variation averaged to all the pixels in an image ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .    in the early stages of this work we used the sdss dr2 to estimate the best way to quantify the internal colour variation .",
    "we studied the internal colour variation within a sample of galaxies with a concentration index @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the concentration index is defined as the ratio between two radii enclosing different amounts of light flux .",
    "the sdss definition uses the radii containing @xmath41 , _",
    "r90 _ , and @xmath42 , _",
    "r50 _ , of the total galactic light .",
    "@xcite and @xcite found that @xmath43 is the boundary that separates early from late - type galaxies , according to both their morphological and spectral features .",
    "the actual value of this boundary can vary depending on level of restriction needed for contaminants within one or the other type of galaxies    after thoroughly testing various methods using the quantities provided by the sdss database , we reached the conclusion that the surface brightness profile appears to be the best way to quantify the internal colour variation in galaxies as opposed to magnitude based estimations , e.g. comparing the _ fibre _ or _",
    "colours with the global galactic colours .",
    "the sdss provides measurements of surface brightness averaged within circular concentric annuli at different galactic radii .",
    "we obtain colour gradients from these measurements .",
    "the two innermost annuli , @xmath44 arcsec , are excluded from the calculation , since they are the most affected by seeing ( the median psf width in the r band for the sdss dr7 is @xmath45 arcsec ) .",
    "previous studies , such as that from @xcite have reported that the internal colour variation is diminished if the annuli most affected by seeing are considered for obtaining the surface brightness profile .    from the sdss averaged surface brightness profile we get the cumulative one .",
    "this last one is fitted to a taut spline , using a fourth order polynomial .",
    "thus we need galaxies to have measurements of average surface brightness in at least four annuli .",
    "the interpolated surface brightness points are differentiated .",
    "we then convert the resulting surface brightness into magnitudes .",
    "we do this last step only for the radii corresponding to the outer ones from the initial annuli .",
    "these magnitudes are corrected with the global ( k+e)-correction obtained for the whole galaxy .",
    "colour gradients are finally obtained by calculating the slope of the straight line that best fits the colours , @xmath46 , at different galactic radii ( those for which a surface brightness profile is provided in the sdss ) versus the radii of the annuli normalised by the galaxy half light radius in the r - band , @xmath47 : @xmath48    the normalisation in radius is done in order to allow us to compare galaxies with different light distributions and sizes .",
    "the colour gradients of all the galaxies within the four studied luminosity - threshold samples have been obtained from the surface brightness profile out to the annulus containing the radius @xmath49 .",
    "thus , the radial coverage is consistent with previous studies .",
    "a further analysis on the effect of radial coverage is made in [ a_rad ] . in order to allow a fair comparison with recent literature",
    "we have also obtained colour gradients from the variation of internal colour with the logarithm of the normalised radius ( colour per radial decade ) .    when computing the errors on the measured gradients we use a monte carlo method to take into account the observational errors in both the surface brightness and @xmath47 measurements .",
    "surface brightness values within a galaxy are related , with one value influencing the values at outer radii . in order to simplify the calculation we use a compromise by effectively considering the surface brightness values as independent and restricting the random values , obtained with the monte carlo method , within @xmath50 .",
    "thus , in order to include the observational errors , we repeat the whole process , except for the calculation of the ( k+e)-correction , @xmath51 times for each galaxy using each time a random value extracted from the error distribution for the variables within @xmath50 of the measurements , assuming that the initial errors have a gaussian distribution .",
    "we obtain the probability distribution from the monte carlo runs making use of a _ simple estimator _ ] here the weight , w , is @xmath52 if @xmath53 and @xmath54 otherwise . ]",
    "and then we calculate the expected value of the colour gradient and its variance .",
    "here we explore the origin of the colour gradient distribution in connection with the different classifications of galaxies into either early and late types or star forming , passively evolving and hosting nuclear activity .",
    "we have calculated the gradients for the @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 colours .",
    "[ fig : allgrad ] shows the distribution of the @xmath5 and @xmath9 colour gradients for galaxies in sample _",
    "s20.5_. we have found that the distributions of the colour gradients in the @xmath6 and @xmath5 colours are similar .",
    "the distributions of the colour gradients in the @xmath7 , @xmath9 and @xmath8 colours are also similar between them .",
    "as described in the introduction this is due to the similarity in the spectral characteristics that these colours probe .",
    "[ fig : err_grad ] presents the dependency of the variance in the colour gradient with the actual values of the @xmath5 and @xmath9 colour gradients . from this figure",
    "we learn that galaxies with redder cores ( negative colour gradient ) measured from the @xmath9 colour gradients , tend to have larger errors , due to the z band being the noisiest among the four in this study .",
    "the same is not true for the @xmath5 colour gradients .",
    "it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : err_grad ] that steeper gradients tend to have larger errors , for both colour gradients .",
    "[ fig : allgrad ] shows that both the @xmath5 and @xmath9 colour gradients for sample _ s20.5 _ have median values that are similar : @xmath55 , @xmath56 , respectively ( @xmath57 , @xmath58 , when defining colour gradients as colour per decade in normalised radius , in decimal logarithmic units ) .",
    "however , the distribution for the @xmath9 colour gradient presents a clear longer negative tail .",
    "this slight difference is likely to be due to the fact that redder stars contribute more in the @xmath9 than in the @xmath5 colour , giving rise to steeper gradients .",
    "however , the tilted distribution of the @xmath9 colour gradient variance shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : err_grad ] , would also be responsible , at least in part , for this difference .",
    "we have also compared the distribution of colour gradients for the different luminosity - threshold selections defined in table [ tab : sample ] .",
    "there is not a clear change in the shape of the distributions for the different samples , just different numbers of galaxies .",
    "the change in median values from one sample to another is rather small : @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 for the median @xmath5 colour gradient of samples _",

    "these last values are roughly in agreement with the @xcite study , where they found a non monotonic dependency of colour gradients with magnitude , when galaxies fainter than @xmath65 were considered .    in appendix [ ap - sys ]",
    "we analyse some of the systematic effects that could affect the distribution of colour gradients , including the ellipticity , the amount of light considered in the calculation and the effect of having close pairs of galaxies . considering the result found in appendix [ ap - sys ] and the similar distributions for all the luminosity - threshold samples considered in this work",
    ", we can conclude that the results for the colour gradient distribution are robust .",
    "returning to fig .",
    "[ fig : allgrad ] , we can clearly see there that galaxies tend to have small internal colour variation , resulting in quite flat colour gradients .",
    "nevertheless , the median of the distribution is negative , implying that , in general , galaxy centres are redder than their outer parts .",

    "[ fig : allgrad ] shows then that galaxies tend to have more metal rich cores that might also be hosting older stellar populations .",

    "a remarkable feature of fig . [ fig : allgrad ] is that the colour gradient distributions presents a single peak .",
    "this result could be indicating that galaxies with different structural characteristics , late and early type galaxies , have undergone similar star formation histories .",
    "however , the distribution of colour gradients presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : allgrad ] is much broader than a gaussian .",
    "we have checked whether this is due to the observational errors using monte carlo simulations .",

    "thus , we demonstrate that the width and shape of the colour gradient distribution can not be explained by the error distribution alone and that galaxies do indeed present different intrinsic colour gradients .",

    "colour gradients are normally defined in the literature as the colour variation as a function of the logarithm of the radius .",
    "here we have used the variation of colour as a function of the radius itself . using the former definition we have checked that we obtain qualitatively similar trends for colour gradients , except that their distribution covers a broader dynamical range . for the _ s20.5 _",
    "sample , the median values of these distributions are @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively for the @xmath9 and @xmath5 colour gradients . in our calculation of colour gradients",
    "we assume the observational errors in both colours and radii to be normally distributed . when using the logarithm of normalised radius , the error distribution deviates from a gaussian .",
    "thus , in order to make an accurate comparison we should modify the way we are including the observational errors in our calculation .",
    "this is likely to have a fundamental effect on the estimated errors , while colour gradients would remain practically unchanged . leaving apart this issue , when defining the colour gradient as colour variation as a function of the logarithm of the radius we find qualitatively similar tendencies to the ones previously reported .",
    "the correlations appear stronger when defining colour gradients in this way , due to the enhanced dynamical range .",
    "the fact that steep colour gradients are linked with a higher presence of young stars could provide an alternative method for exploring the interactions between galaxies . a thorough spectral analysis of those galaxies which present extreme colour variations could help us to better understand the mechanisms that generate either bluer or redder cores within galaxies .",

    "[ fig : elip_med ] shows that the distribution of the error does not appreciably change as a function the projected axis ratio .",

    "[ fig : elip_med ] , the spearman coefficient is too small to support statistically such a linear relation .",
    "we can conclude that colour gradients do not vary in a significant manner with @xmath118 , except for very inclined late - type galaxies , which are most likely affected by their internal dimming .",
    "since the z - band is the least affected by dust extinction , this last result is consistent with the lack of @xmath9 colour gradient variation with @xmath118 .",
    "here we study the bias that we could be introducing by leaving out the innermost light , @xmath128 arcsec , of the galaxy .",
    "for all the studied galaxies , colour gradients have been obtained from the surface brightness within two times the radius containing half the total galactic light . in section  [ sec : dr7sample ] it was pointed out that the _ s21 _ sample contains galaxies with half light radii , @xmath47 , within the two innermost annuli that we neglect computing the colour gradient . for the rest of the samples",
    "this does not occur .",
    "moreover , in these samples less than @xmath2% of the galaxies have their half light radii within the first annuli considered in the calculation of colour gradients , @xmath129 ( @xmath130 annulus in the sdss database ) .",

    "when defining the colour gradient in decades of normalised radii ( radius in logarithmic units ) , we also find that colour gradients get steeper for galaxies with larger @xmath47 . @xcite",
    "finds a similar tendency with effective radius , supporting the robustness of our result .    dividing our sample into late and early - types according to the concentration index",

    "the colour gradient of early - type galaxies , remains quite constant with galactic size .",
    "for the samples of galaxies under study , the colour gradient variation with @xmath47 has been found to be independent of the amount of light used for obtaining it .",
