    "in the standard model ( sm ) , with three families of quarks , the unique cp violating phase of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix can explain some of the observed cp violating phenomena in @xmath8 and @xmath9 systems .",
    "however , the failure of the km phase in explaining the matter - antimatter asymmetry and some recent measurements of cp violating observations in @xmath9 meson mixings and decays motivates the search for new source of cp violation ( cpv ) .",
    "therefore , it is an important issue to explore and to find new cp violating effects in various systems , such as cosmos , large hadron collider ( lhc ) , tevatron , @xmath9 factories etc .",
    "recently , several hints for the existence of new cp violating sources are revealed in experiments .",
    "the first hint is observed in the cp asymmetries ( cpas ) of @xmath10 decays where by naive sm estimation , one expects that @xmath11 and @xmath12 decays have similar cpas .",
    "however , it is surprising that the world average difference between the two cpas contradicts the expectation as the experimental result is @xcite a_cp= a_cp(^+ k^- ) - a_cp(^0 k^-)= -(14.8_-1.4^ + 1.3)% , whereas the sm prediction is @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the large deviation from the sm prediction indicates a puzzle in the asymmetries and it is introduced in the literature as @xmath14 puzzle @xcite .",
    "the second hint is observed in the time - dependent cpa of @xmath15 system , where cdf and d have shown an unexpected large cp phase in the mixing - induced cpa for @xmath16 and the two possible solutions are given by @xcite 2^j/_s=2_s + 2^np_s= -0.75^+ 0.32_-0.21  ` or `   -2.38^+0.25_-0.34 at @xmath17 confidence level ( cl ) . here , @xmath18",
    "@xcite is the sm cp violating phase and @xmath19 is the cp violating phase of new physics .",
    "the significant deviation from the sm prediction could be speculated by the contributions of new physics .",
    "the third hint is observed in the like - sign charge asymmetry which is defined as @xcite ^b_s & = & , [ eq : absl_exp ] where @xmath20 denotes the number of events that @xmath21- and @xmath22-hadron semileptonically decay into two positive ( negative ) muons .",
    "recently , d collaboration has announced the measurement on @xmath5 in the dimuon events @xcite with ^b_s = ( -9.57 2.51(stat ) 1.46 ( syst ) ) 10 ^ -3 .",
    "the sm prediction is @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "if the semileptonic b - hadron decays do not involve cp violating phase , then the charge asymmetry is directly related to the mixing - induced cpas in @xmath24- and @xmath15-meson oscillations .",
    "although the errors of the data are still large , however the @xmath25 standard deviations from the sm prediction can be attributed to new cp violating phases in @xmath4 and @xmath26 transitions @xcite .    in order to explore the new physics and to avoid the uncontrollable qcd uncertainties , we will concentrate our study on the mixing parameter @xmath1 , the charge asymmetry @xmath5 and the time - dependent cpa in @xmath27 oscillation , where qcd effects can be controlled well by lattice qcd .    in the literature , many extensions of the sm such as chiral color models @xcite , @xmath28 models @xcite etc have been proposed .",
    "the flavor non - universal axigluon in the generalized chiral color models @xcite has been studied for solving the anomalous forward - backward asymmetry ( fba ) in the top - quark pair production at the tevatron @xcite .",
    "although other models such as z , diquarks models @xcite etc may have significant contributions to the fba , however , large gauge couplings and flavor changing effects should be introduced in which chiral color model does not need .",
    "inspired by the effects of the axigluon on the top - quark fba , we study the axigluon - mediated phenomena in @xmath9-meson system .    a flavor universal axigluon has flavor - conserving effects only . for non - universal axigluon which has different couplings to different quarks , flavor changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) can be generated at tree level .",
    "this is achieved after transforming the weak eigenstates of the quarks into their physical eigenstates . as a consequence ,",
    "many phenomena will be affected by these fcnc effects . in this paper",
