    "in cosmology the weak lensing formalism is usually used for making lensing maps , which then give the dark matter distribution .",
    "the formalism assumes an image has distortion from a shear and convergence , and that these are constant over the image . for extended sources or more strongly lensed objects",
    "this may not be appropriate as the shear and convergence can vary appreciably over an image .",
    "the first - order correction to this has been calculated and termed flexion , and is shown to give some arc - like features to images  @xcite . rather surprisingly , the extension of this idea to arbitrary lens strength has not been given .",

    "the physical origin of this comes from the non - linear geodesic deviation equations , which describes how non - infinitesimally separated geodesics deviate from each other  @xcite .",

    ", we can construct higher - order lensing maps and extensions of the amplification matrix of normal weak lensing . at each order",
    "an amplification tensor can be decomposed into its various trace free parts which form the invariant parts   spin components   of the map , analogous to the convergence ( trace ) and shear ( trace - free ) as invariants of the amplification matrix .",
    "each invariant mode ( a ` roulette ' ) distorts an image in a peculiar way , such that the sum over all of them is able to reconstruct a complete image .",
    "we show also that an image can be inverted to give the amplitudes ( in principle ) of each mode , giving a correspondence between a lens and strongly distorted image . in a sense , then , this expansion is the natural expansion for lensed images .    in the following section ,",
    "we formulate the non - linear geodesic deviation equation in the way we need it , and integrate it to give the maps at each order .",
    "we then show how we can decompose this map into its independent trace - free parts which are the spin modes of each map .",
    "we then discuss the formalism in the weak field approximation , and give a couple of simple examples of the roulette series in action .",
    "we then conclude , and give an appendix on some fundamental trig integrals which appear in the roulette amplitudes .",
    "the computation of the convergence and shear is achieved from the geodesic deviation equation which is linear in the deviation vector  @xmath0 which joins two neighbouring null geodesics of a congruence @xmath1 : denote spacetime indices , @xmath2 or @xmath3 as an index denotes projection of that index in the direction of @xmath2 or @xmath3 .",

    "the source is shown on the left and the magnified image on the right ( calculated with @xmath213 )   these are shown to scale , with the einstein radius of the lens shown for reference . in the top row",
    "we fix the maximum @xmath25 used , and add up all the possible spins . in the bottom row",
    "we add up all possible spins up to the maximum shown . ]",
    "we consider in fig .",
    "[ sjakdcdfhbv ] adding up the modes in two different ways . in the top row",
    "we add up to a fixed @xmath25 shown , including all the spin modes up to that order   this is the natural way to add up the modes as each mode contributes a factor of @xmath214 less .",
    "so , for @xmath33 , we include the shear and convergence , and for @xmath176 we add in the flexion . near the centre of the image",
    "this is reasonably accurate , but far from it it is not . for large @xmath25",
    "we recover the exact image .",
    "it is also instructive to add in each spin type one at a time   we show this in the second row .",
    "we fix @xmath213 , and add up all the spin-0 modes , then the spin-1 modes and so on , until the image is constructed .",
    "note that the wobbles and cusps on the outer curves for small @xmath25 are the equivalent of the spurious images found in the image - to - source case above , and curves of larger radius display extravagant loops .",
    "even with @xmath215 , larger circles than shown have still not converged .",
    "the image shown here corresponds to that found by using the exact solution directly .",
    "we have presented a new extension of the usual weak lensing formalism which can be accurately used in the strong lensing regime to reconstruct the image(s ) of the source . by expanding the general solution of the non - linear geodesic deviation equation in the screen space",
    ", one can add to the usual jacobi map a series of lensing maps of arbitrary order , given by tensors of increasing rank .",
    "we have shown how a map at each order can be invariantly decomposed into a set of trace - free tensors representing the invariant degrees of freedom and spin modes of the map .",
    "then we show how to reduce these trace - free tensors into distortions on the plane , which are the normal modes we call roulettes .",
    "these extend the convergence , shear and flexion familiar from weak lensing to arbitrary order , providing a completion of the weak lensing formalism .",
    "a complete image can be given as an appropriate two dimensional sum over these roulettes .",
    "the amplitude of each roulette can be found from integrating in a circle around a point in the image .",
    "these amplitudes are related to derivatives of the mass distribution of the lens in the weak field approximation . more generally , they are derivatives of the lensing potential perpendicular to the line of sight .",
    "we then gave a couple of examples of explicit image reconstruction for a point mass and a singular isothermal sphere , complementing those in paper i. although these examples are rather simple , and the exact solutions known , they are really useful to test out the method and present how an image is constructed in the strong lensing regime . an intriguing peculiarity of the roulettes is the appearance and distribution of spurious images , and understanding these in relation to the full geometry of photon surfaces might be interesting  @xcite .",
    "a practical use for this formalism lies , in principle , in being able to reconstruct the mass distribution if one can extract the amplitudes and orientation of the roulettes .",
    "so , given an observation of lensed galaxies around a lens , each lensed imaged would give an estimate of the mass and its first few derivatives at the image position . from this the entire lens mass distribution",
    "could   in principle   be reconstructed .",
    "this , together with more accurate lens modelling , is left for future work .",
    "i would like to thank david bacon and julien larena for discussions .",
    "this work is funded by the national research foundation ( south africa ) .",
    "for completeness we also give the relevant part of the solution of the linear part of the gde , which is normally only presented in perturbed minkowski space .",
    "the difference in the style of derivation is that the distortion tensor is already first - order so that perturbations of the redshift and affine parameter do not enter the hessian .",
    "they do however enter the jacobi map because the optical tidal matrix is non - zero in the background .",
    "we need to expand the derivatives along @xmath1 into a background and perturbed part . writing @xmath216 ,",
    "the linear gde becomes [ djhbvdjfhbvdhbjv ] _ a - |_ab^b = _",
    "ab|^b -2|k^bk^a_a_b|_a + ^d _",
    "ab|k^a|k^b _ d|_a , where @xmath217 is the background derivative along the null vector ( from observer to source ) . the background deviation vector is @xmath218 .",
    "the components of the perturbed part of @xmath1 we require are given by a^2k^0()=-2 + 2_o-_0^(+ ) ,  k^=-k^0-(1+z)^2(+ ) , which gives a^3|k^ak^b_a_b ( a)=2[-(^2+)](-_o)-(+)+[-(^2+)](+ ) .",
    "the perturbed christoffel symbols give the contribution a^3^d _",
    "ab|k^a|k^b _ d ( a ) = --(1+)-+-2 ^ 2(+ )    using 2a^2e_ab=(+ ) the optical tidal matrix becomes : _",
    "ab&=&-(1+z)^2_ab ( 2| + + p+_+2e_)-2(1+z)^2e_ab +   + & = & -(1+z)^4_ab + & & + ( 1+z)^4(+ ) .   ( going from the first to the second line we have transformed to the comoving tetrad @xmath219 as usual . )    the solution to is found using the same steps leading to .",
    "consequently we have [ something like - to check ! ! ! ] _",
    "here we collect together some notes on the trig integrals appearing in the spin decomposition of the maps .",
    "the key integrals are ^m(k)_s&=&_-^^k^m - k+1s , +  kms&=&_-^^k^m - k+1s .",
    "these are surprisingly complicated functions of @xmath220 .",
    "to evaluate we use the identity _",
    "0^/2 ^ 2p-1 ^ 2p-1= , from which it follows _ -^^2p^2p= . for odd powers",
    "these integrals give zero .",
    "now expand the @xmath221 and @xmath222 using s&=&_k=0^s/2 ( -1)^ks2k ^n-2k^2k , + s&=&_k=0^(s-1)/2 ( -1)^ks2k+1 ^n-2k-1 ^ 2k+1 , to give ^m(k)_s&=&\\ {                an alternative way to calculate these is to use recurrence relations for @xmath226 ( or just use maple ! ) .",
    "these are easily derivable from trig identities : ^m(k+2)_s-^m-2(k)_s+^m(k)_s&=&0 , + ^m(k)_s-1+^m(k)_s+1 - 2^m+1(k)_s&=&0 and by integrating by parts twice : ( m - k+1)(m - k)^m(k+2)_s+[s^2 + 2k^2-(2k+1)(m+1)]^m(k)_s+k(k-1)^m(k-2)_s=0 , with similar identities for @xmath227 .",
    "some identities are essential for proving that the odd modes are zero in the weak gravitational field approximation .",
    "these are found by integrating by parts once : [ dcksbcskbcsbc ] sk+1ms&=&(k+1)^m(k)_s+(k - m)^m(k+2)_s , + s0ms&=&-(m+1)^m(1)_s , + sm+1ms&=&(m+1)^m(m)_s .",
    "again there are similar identities for @xmath228 which are required for @xmath125 ."
