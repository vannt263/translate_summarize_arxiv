    "a more detailed study of the precipitate - dislocation interaction is currently underway .      aside from the pioneering study by clark @xcite",
    "there has been very limited quantitative work on the precipitation strengthening response in mg - zn alloys .",
    "although this early work was valuable in establishing that there was a strong precipitation hardening response , the lack of control over the deformation poses difficulties in understanding the effectiveness of pre - ageing deformation in enhancing @xmath0nucleation . in clark s study , pre - ageing deformation was carried out by cold - rolling mg - zn sheet ; however , this would inevitably result in extensive deformation twinning in addition to dislocation glide .",
    "the relative extent of twinning and slip will depend on the orientation of each individual grains and it is likely that the precipitation - strengthening response will vary between grains .",
    "this makes it impossible to properly connect the microstructure to the bulk mechanical properties .    in the present study ,",
    "the use of texture combined with controlled tensile deformation ensured that twinning was avoided and that changes in the precipitation response can be ascribed unambiguously to nucleation on dislocations .",
    "this is particularly important since twins also act as strong nucleation sites for coarse ( and therefore poorly strengthening ) @xmath0and particles .",
    "since the amount of deformation was closely controlled , it was possible to determine the net plastic strain , rather than the total applied strain .",
    "this allowed the elastic strain ( which does not contribute to dislocation multiplication ) to be excluded from consideration .",
    "the majority of the the improvement in the yield strength was achieved with 3% plastic strain with the response diminishing at higher strains .",
    "the ageing temperature of 150@xmath4 is within the temperature range used for stress annealing of mg - zn alloys @xcite and the diminishing return is due to the annealing out of deformations .",
    "this is evident in the hardness test results ( fig  [ fig - hardness ] ) that show an increase in hardness after pre - ageing deformation ( indicating work - hardening ) and an immediate drop in hardness upon ageing as the stress is relieved .",
    "a similar effective was noted by clark @xcite for 10 and 20% rolling reductions , but as noted above the complex nature of the deformation made the observation difficult to interpret .",
    "the rapid annealing out of dislocations indicates that the effective window for pre - ageing deformation is quite narrow and that little further improvement in the strength is to be expected for purely tensile deformation of more than 5% strain .",
    "the inhomogeneity of the precipitate distribution shows a substantial effect on the strength and ductility , but one that is rarely given serious consideration .",
    "it is well known that the effectiveness of the precipitates in restricting dislocation motion depends on the inverse spacing between precipitates .",
    "however , how this spacing is calculated and expressed often escapes notice .",
    "the standard approach of determining an average spacing from the volume fraction and number density does not take any account that the precipitate distribution is inhomogeneous . the delaunay triangulation method applied in the present work",
    "provides an average value of the interparticle spacing that takes into account inhomogeneity in the particle distribution .",
    "along with related methods such as voronoi decomposition @xcite it has been shown to provide a more realistic measure of the effective particle spacing @xcite . this work has demonstrated that this calculated @xmath22 values underestimates the effective spacing between particles , resulting in an overestimate of the orowan strengthening effect .",
    "in addition to the variation between measured and calculated @xmath22 values , it is also important to consider the effect of the spread of particle spacings on the mechanical properties . unfortunately , the individual spacings between precipitates were not directly accessible with the current software . however , the diameter distributions are known and as a first approximation the system can be divided into subsystems of arbitrary width and number fraction , each having a homogeneous diameter value .",

    "[ htpb ]    ) and elongation to failure ( @xmath64 ) are shown relative to the value for the mode of the distribution ( 10 nm ) .",
    "[ fig - spread ] ]    the precipitate diameter distributions ( fig  [ fig - diameter ] ) all showed positive skew ( that is , the majority of the diameter values were less than the mean ) and it is reasonable to infer that the distribution of particle spacings will therefore show negative skew , ( that is , the majority of the @xmath22 values being greater than the mean ) .",
    "this indicates that large volumes of the matrix will be poorly strengthened , while smaller regions will be substantially stronger than average .",
    "this is consistent with the tem observations of clusters of particles along dislocations and large , regions with low particle densities and appears reasonable for a microstructure where nucleation occurs preferentially at heterogeneous sites .",
    "such a negatively skewed precipitate spacing is particularly undesirable for mechanical properties .",
    "the large volumes of poorly strengthened matrix will experience slip at lower stresses than the average spacing would indicate , while misfit dislocations will rapidly build up in regions with closely - spaced particles , leading to premature failure",
    ". however , the effect on yield strength and ductility are subtly different , due to the work hardening behaviour .",
    "the spread of yield strength values from lowest ( high particle spacing ) to highest ( low particle spacing ) means that slip will occur first where the particles are most widely dispersed ; i.e. large volumes of the matrix in which precipitates are sparse , gliding at low flow stresses until they intersect with a precipitate . however , when the particles are resistant to shearing by dislocations , dislocation loops will either cross - slip or accumulate around the bypassed precipitates , resulting in work - hardening .",
    "this feedback will impede further glide through those regions of the matrix , effectively reducing the disparity in yield strength between regions of the matrix .",
    "the situation with ductility is somewhat different .",
    "ductile failure is assumed to take place when the dislocation density around a given particle reaches a critical threshold , which is determined by the particle spacing .",
    "the alloy can again be divided into subsystems of different spacings and hence critical imposed strain .",
    "dislocations accumulate most rapidly in regions where the particles are closely spaced , however , unlike the strengthening behaviour there is no effective feedback .",
    "once necking commences in these regions it will accelerate rather than impede failure in the surrounding volume .",
    "it might be expected , therefore that precipitation strengthening  particularly where there is a broad range of particle spacings  would have a more pronounced effect on ductility than on strength .",
    "this appears to be borne out in the experimental results where , comparing the non - deformed and 5% strained samples the strength increases by @xmath80110% , while the ductility was reduced to 35% of the original value .",

    "correspondingly , the average diameter of the precipitates decreased from 14 nm to 9 nm . *",
    "the precipitate distribution was somewhat inhomogeneous , resulting in the interparticle spacing on the basal plane being approximately 15% greater than for a fully homogeneous case .",
    "it was considered probable that interparticle spacings on the prismatic planes are similarly underestimated by the orowan equations . *",
    "the yield strength ( @xmath82 ) increased from 273mpa ( no strain ) to 309mpa ( 5% strain ) .",
    "there was a rapidly diminishing return for the increase of yield strength with increasing deformation , with 3% strain being nearly as effective as 5% .",
    "the increase in yield strength was roughly linearly proportional to the interparticle spacing on basal or prismatic planes , however , the rate of increase ( basal : 3100mpa.nm , prismatic 3550mpa.nm ) was lower than calculated for orowan looping of rod - shaped particles ( 4760mpa.nm ) . * the ductility ( tensile elongation to failure ) decreased from 17% to 6% .",
    "the true fracture strain and uniform elongation showed a linear relationship with the precipitate spacing on basal and prismatic planes , consistent with models for ductile failure due to the accumulation of geometrically necessary dislocations around the precipitates .",

    "<S> alloys were extruded to obtain a texture so as to avoid formation of twins and thus to ensure that dislocations were the primary nucleation site . pre - ageing strain refined precipitate length and diameter , with average length reduced from 440 nm to 60 nm and diameter from 14 nm to 9 nm . </S>",
    "<S> interparticle spacings were measured from micrographs and indicated some inhomogeneity in the precipitate distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the yield stress of the alloy increased from 273mpa to 309mpa . </S>",
    "<S> the yield stress increased linearly as a function of reciprocal interparticle spacing , but at a lower rate than predicted for orowan strengthening . </S>",
    "<S> pre - ageing deformation also resulted in a significant loss of ductility ( from 17% to 6% elongation ) . </S>",
    "<S> both true strain at failure and uniform elongation showed a linear relationship with particle spacing , in agreement with models for the accumulation of dislocations around non - deforming obstacles . </S>",
    "<S> samples subjected to 3% pre - ageing deformation showed a substantially increased ageing response compared to non - deformed material ; however , additional deformation ( to 5% strain ) resulted in only modest changes in precipitate distribution and mechanical properties .    </S>",
