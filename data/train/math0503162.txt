    "a self - tangency of a plane curve is _ dangerous _ if the orientations on the tangent directions to the curve agree at the tangency .",
    "two plane curves without dangerous self - tangencies are _ safely homotopic _ if they are homotopic through plane curves without dangerous self - tangencies .",
    "a generic homotopy of plane curves may contain three types of singularities , of which one is the dangerous self - tangency ; see figure  [ fig : perestroikas ] .",
    "arnold @xcite initiated the study of plane curves up to safe homotopy , in particular introducing a function @xmath2 on plane curves without dangerous self - tangencies . in the literature , any function of plane curves without dangerous self - tangencies which does not change under safe homotopy",
    "is called a _",
    "@xmath2-type invariant_.        the key point of interest of plane curves without dangerous self - tangencies is their close link to contact geometry , first noted by arnold .",
    "there is a natural way to associate to any such plane curve a legendrian knot in @xmath3 , the @xmath4-jet space of @xmath5 , which is a contact manifold .",
    "we call this the _ conormal knot _ of the plane curve . for details , see section  [ ssec : def ] .",
    "the conormal knot is a special case of a construction which associates a legendrian submanifold to any embedded submanifold of any manifold , or to any immersed submanifold without dangerous self - tangencies .",
    "this construction has recently been applied to construct new invariants of knots in @xmath6 , and potentially yields interesting isotopy invariants of arbitrary submanifolds ; see @xcite or @xcite for an introduction .",
    "there are several well - known @xmath2-type invariants of plane curves , all arising from the conormal knot construction .",
    "the simplest is the whitney index , or the degree of the gauss map of the plane curve .",
    "this is invariant under safe homotopy since it is invariant more generally under regular homotopy ; it also counts the number of times the conormal knot winds around the base of the solid torus @xmath3 .",
    "a more nontrivial @xmath2-type invariant , as observed by arnold , is simply the knot type of the conormal knot in the solid torus .",
    "more interesting still , since the conormal is legendrian , the contact planes along the conormal knot give it a framing , and so the framed knot type of the conormal knot is invariant under safe homotopy .",
    "the framing is measured by a number which is arnold s original @xmath2 invariant .    to the author s knowledge",
    ", all previous work on @xmath2-type invariants is based on studying the framed knot type of the conormal knot .",
    "for instance , goryunov @xcite examined the space of finite type invariants of plane curves without dangerous self - tangencies , and chmutov , goryunov , and murakami @xcite introduced a @xmath2-type invariant in the form of a homfly polynomial for the framed conormal knot .    on the other hand ,",
    "two safely homotopic plane curves have conormal knots which are isotopic not just as framed knots , but as legendrian knots .",
    "we will see that the legendrian type of the conormal knot gives a finer classification of plane curves than the framed knot type .",
    "the fact ( essentially ) that legendrian isotopy is a subtler notion than framed isotopy was famously demonstrated by chekanov @xcite for knots in @xmath7 , using a combinatorial form of legendrian contact homology @xcite . in this paper , we show that contact homology gives a similar result in our case .",

    "the orientation on @xmath8 determines two unit vectors , @xmath10 in the direction of @xmath8 and @xmath11 given by rotating @xmath10 @xmath12 counterclockwise .",
    "the _ conormal knot _ of @xmath8 is the subset of the unit cotangent bundle @xmath13 given by @xmath14 the conormal knot inherits an orientation from the orientation on @xmath8 , since each point on @xmath8 yields one point in the conormal knot .    here",
    "the metric on the fibers of @xmath15 used to define @xmath13 is dual to the standard metric on @xmath1 .",
    "if @xmath8 has no dangerous self - tangencies , then its conormal knot is embedded in @xmath13 , and so it makes sense to use the term `` knot . ''",
    "we remark that the conormal knot is actually one half of the usual unit conormal bundle over the plane curve ; the orientation of the plane curve , along with the orientation of @xmath1 , induces a coorientation on the curve , which picks out half of the conormal bundle .",
    "the space @xmath13 has a natural contact structure given by the kernel of the @xmath4-form @xmath16 , where @xmath17 are coordinates on @xmath1 and @xmath18 are dual coordinates in the cotangent fibers .",
    "it is easy to check that the conormal knot @xmath19 of any plane curve is legendrian with respect to this contact structure , i.e. , that @xmath20 .",

    "we can identify @xmath13 and @xmath3 by setting @xmath26 ( the argument of the vector @xmath27 ) , @xmath28 , @xmath29 ; this map identifies the contact structures as well .",
    "it is convenient to picture a legendrian knot in @xmath3 in terms of its _ front _ , or projection to @xmath30 given by the @xmath31 coordinates . in the subject , `` front",

    "a generic legendrian knot has a front whose only singularities are double points and cusps .",
    "we can recover a legendrian knot from its front by setting @xmath32 ; in particular , there is no need to specify over- and undercrossing information for a front .",

    "bennequin number in @xmath3 was first introduced by tabachnikov @xcite .",
    "we now examine the front @xmath19 of the conormal knot of a plane curve @xmath8 .",
    "there is a simple description for @xmath19 : any point @xmath40 on @xmath8 , with unit tangent vector @xmath41 , gives the point @xmath42 in @xmath19 , and @xmath19 is obtained by allowing @xmath40 to range over @xmath8 .",
    "points of inflection of @xmath8 correspond to cusps of @xmath19 , and it is easy to check that any right cusp of @xmath19 is traversed upwards and any left cusp downwards ; just draw a neighborhood of an inflection point of @xmath8 .    as for the classical legendrian invariants of @xmath19 ,",
    "since @xmath19 has equal numbers of left and right cusps , it follows that @xmath43 .",
    "the thurston ",
    "bennequin number of @xmath19 measures framing and is essentially arnold s @xmath2 invariant : @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the winding number of @xmath19 around @xmath5 .",
    "hence the framed knot type of @xmath19 determines all classical information about @xmath19 .",
    "we have already discussed how to define the conormal knot front of a plane curve , but the definition is not very useful computationally . here",
    "we present an algorithm for easily obtaining a front isotopic to the conormal knot front .    call a plane curve _ rectilinear _ if it is completely composed of line segments parallel to either coordinate axis , along with arbitrarily small smoothing @xmath12 corners , and no two line segments lie on the same ( horizontal or vertical ) line .",
    "clearly any plane curve is isotopic to a rectilinear curve , and so it suffices to describe the conormal front for any rectilinear curve .    for ease of notation ,",
    "label the coordinate axes @xmath46 and @xmath47 rather than @xmath48 and @xmath49 . to each line segment @xmath50 in a rectilinear plane curve , we associate the following point in @xmath30 :    * @xmath51 if @xmath50 is in the @xmath52 direction and @xmath47 is the @xmath47 coordinate of @xmath50 ; * @xmath53 if @xmath50 is in the @xmath54 direction and @xmath46 is the @xmath46 coordinate of @xmath50 ; * @xmath55 if @xmath50 is in the @xmath56 direction and @xmath47 is the @xmath47 coordinate of @xmath50 ; * @xmath57 if @xmath50 is in the @xmath58 direction and @xmath46 is the @xmath46 coordinate of @xmath50 .    next , `` connect the dots '' by joining the points corresponding to line segments which share an endpoint . finally , smooth the result , rounding corners and placing cusps where necessary .",
    "see figure  [ fig : figure8 ] .",
    "it is clear that the conormal front for the rectilinear curve passes through the points given in the algorithm above , since they comprise the conormal for the line segments of the rectilinear curve .",
    "the conormals of the smoothing corners interpolate between these points .",
    "the conormal front for a smoothing corner at the point @xmath59 is given by @xmath60 for some range of @xmath33 in an interval of length @xmath61 .",
    "hence the conormal fronts for any two smoothing corners intersect either once or not at all .",
    "it follows that , up to legendrian isotopy , the conormals for the smoothing corners can be approximated by the line segments joining points in the algorithm above .",
    "we claim that the two conormal knots are not legendrian isotopic . indeed , applying the legendrian satellite construction ( see the appendix of @xcite ) to the conormal fronts and the stabilized unknot in @xmath7 yields two familiar legendrian knots in @xmath7 : these are called `` eliashberg knots '' in @xcite and labeled @xmath64 and @xmath65 . see figure  [ fig : satellite ] .",
    "the two knots can be distinguished by their contact homology differential graded algebras @xcite ; in particular , @xmath64 has poincar polynomial @xmath66 and @xmath65 has poincar polynomial @xmath67 .",
    "it follows that the two conormal knots in @xmath3 are not legendrian isotopic , as desired .",
    "we can use the plane curves from proposition  [ prop : distinguish ] to produce an arbitrarily large family of plane curves whose conormal knots have the same classical invariants but are not legendrian isotopic . for @xmath68 , let @xmath69 be the plane curve shown in figure  [ fig : connectsum ] , which can be viewed as a connected sum of the plane curves from proposition  [ prop : distinguish ] .",
    "( note however that the connected sum operation on plane curves is not well - defined . )",
    "we can use the algorithm from section  [ ssec : def ] to find the conormal fronts for @xmath69 .",
    "when @xmath72 is fixed , the conormal fronts for @xmath69 are identical except for @xmath71 tangles . of these tangles , @xmath38",
    "are given by the tangle @xmath75 defined in figure  [ fig : connectsum - front ] , and @xmath77 by @xmath76 .",
    "the situation for @xmath78 is shown in figure  [ fig : connectsum - front ] ; the picture for @xmath79 is very similar .",
    "note that the conormal fronts for @xmath69 are all isotopic as framed knots .    now consider the legendrian satellite @xmath80 of the conormal front for @xmath69 to the stabilized unknot , as in the proof of proposition  [ prop : distinguish ] .",
    "we distinguish between the knots @xmath80 using poincar polynomials for contact homology .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath80 has a graded augmentation , for instance because it has a ruling @xcite .",
    "an examination of maslov indices shows that all crossings in @xmath80 have degrees @xmath81 , except for the crossings in the tangles @xmath82 ; the two crossings in any @xmath75 have degree @xmath4 and @xmath83 , while the two crossings in any @xmath76 have degree @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "since the ( linearized ) differential of the degree @xmath84 crossing in any @xmath76 is @xmath86 , we conclude that any poincar polynomial for @xmath80 has @xmath87 coefficient equal to @xmath77 .",
    "it follows that the legendrian knots @xmath80 , @xmath72 , are not legendrian isotopic , and thus that the plane curves @xmath69 are not safely homotopic .",
    "here we consider loops in the space of plane curves .",
    "let @xmath88 denote the space of plane curves , and let @xmath89 be the discriminant of plane curves with dangerous self - tangencies .",
    "we will present a loop which is contractible in @xmath88 but noncontractible in @xmath90 .",
    "consider the loop @xmath92 in @xmath90 pictured in figure  [ fig : trefoil - loop ] .",
    "this induces a loop @xmath91 of legendrian knots in @xmath3 , also shown in figure  [ fig : trefoil - loop ] . as a loop of framed knots in @xmath3",
    ", @xmath91 essentially rotates the standard rotationally symmetric diagram of the trefoil by @xmath93 ; since @xmath94 , @xmath95 in @xmath96 . by using the contact condition and contact homology , we can do even better : a result of klmn @xcite shows that @xmath91 has much higher order when considered as a loop of legendrian knots .",
    "it is straightforward to check that @xmath92 is contractible in @xmath88 .",
    "note that by the @xmath99-principle , @xmath88 is weakly homotopy equivalent to the space of free loops in @xmath100 , which is not simply connected .",
    "however , @xmath92 can be represented by a loop of _ based _ loops in @xmath100 , and the space of based loops is simply connected since @xmath101 .",
    "now consider @xmath92 as a loop in @xmath90 .",
