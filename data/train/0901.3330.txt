    "laws of thermodynamics are universally valid .",
    "the first - law is about the ` _ conservation _ of energy ' whereas the second - law is about ` _ conversion _ of energy ' .",
    "engineers give equal weightage to both these laws , but unfortunately the second - law has largely been ignored by physicists .",
    "the second - law of thermodynamics which basically tells about the irreversibility of the energy ( heat and work ) conversion process , has far - reaching consequences [ 1 - 3 ] .",
    "when examined from thermodynamics perspectives , it is found [ 1 - 3 ] that : all forms of energies including mass energy ( @xmath0 ) are ` work ' , except the radiation energy ( @xmath1 ) which is ` heat ' .",
    "it is also concluded therein [ 1 - 3 ] that in fact energy carried by particles - with - mass are ` work ' whereas energy carried by massless particle ` photon ' is ` heat ' .",
    "the important consequence is that it necessitates generation of a residual photon in the pair - production process ( of the elementary particles ) ; the spin - conservation requires the residual - photon to be of spin zero ; the ` zero - spin photon ' being unstable further decays into a pair of neutrino and antineutrino .",
    "it has been stressed therein [ 1 ] that any ` proposal ' even as the level of hypothesis , which solves some of the riddles , should be welcomed .",
    "the ` zero - spin photon hypothesis ' @xcite seems to be corrects as it indeed explains reasonably well several riddles of physics and universe including that of the neutrino - handedness and parity - violation .",
    "+   + quantum electro - dynamics ( qed ) has been one of the most successful theories of twentieth century physics .",
    "however , the problem of ` infinity ' had plagued the theory for couple of decades until a stop - gap arrangement or the so called ` re - normalization ' procedure was developed to get rid of the infinity - disaster .",
    "though successful , the ` re - normalization ' has been considered disturbing since beginning ( as mentioned in section-@xmath2 ) . in the present paper ; an alternative way ( suggested in section-@xmath3 ) , to solve the infinity - problem of qed without the need of re - normalization , is being suggested with the help of the ` zero - spin photon hypothesis'-proposed @xcite in an earlier paper ( briefly revisited in section-@xmath4 of this paper ) .",
    "evaluation of the feynman - diagrams to determine the ` amplitude ' _ m _ for the process in question is necessary for calculation of decay rates ( @xmath5 ) and scattering cross - section ( @xmath6 ) , as the case may be . when the higher - order feynman diagrams with closed - loops are evaluated for amplitude _",
    "m _ , the ` integral ' diverges to infinite - value causing the infinity - problem .",
    "infinity - problem in feynman - calculus seem to be the characteristic of the closed - loops in the feynman - diagrams .",
    "one such closed - loop under - consideration in the present - paper is the one that arises when a ( virtual ) photon emits electron and positron ( pair - production ) which are soon reabsorbed ( annihilation ) therein .      `",
    "re - normalization ' is a set of ad - hoc strategy and procedure to ` regularize ' the integral and to absorb ( cancel ) the infinities with the ` re - normalized ' masses and coupling - constants as effective and running respectively .",
    "detailed strategy , procedure and formulae can be found in particle - physics or quantum - mechanics books @xcite .",
    "griffith @xcite mentions about the problem of infinities in qed / qfd while applying the feynman - rules to the feynman - diagrams with closed - loops ( for calculating amplitude _",
    "m _ ) as follows : `` the ` integral ' is logarithmically divergent at large ` q ' .",
    "the disaster in one form or the other , held up the development of quantum electrodynamics for nearly two decades , until , through the combined efforts of many great - physicists ( critics and supporters)dirac , pauli , kramers , weisskopf and bethe through tomonaga , schwinger and feynman  systematic methods were developed , for sweeping the infinities under the rug '' , as ` re - normalization ' .",
    "+   + dirac is reported @xcite to have critically remarked about re - normalization as follows : `` it ( re - normalization ) is just a stop - gap procedure .",
    "there must be some fundamental change in our ideas , probably a change just as fundamental as passage from bohr s orbit theory to quantum - mechanics .",
    "when you get a number turning out to be infinite which ought to be finite , you should admit that there is something wrong with our equations , and not hope that you can get a good theory just by doctoring up ( manipulating ) that number ... , with a good theory the ` infinity ' would never arise in the first place '' .",
    "+   + kaku and thomson @xcite reiterate as satire that `` can ` infinity minus infinity ' yield a meaningful results ( or in the language of physics can @xmath7 ?",
    "mathematically , it is known to be indeterminate ) . to the critics , using one set of infinities ( arising from loops in the feynman diagrams ) to cancel another set of infinities ( arising from electric charge and mass ) looked like a parlor - trick '' .",
    "they @xcite further quote dirac to have said on it that `` this ( @xmath7 ) is not a sensible mathematics .",
    "sensible mathematics involves neglecting a quantity when it turns out to be small , not neglecting it ( or getting rid of it ) because you do not want it '' .",
    "the second - law of thermodynamics , which spells of ` irreversibility ' , prohibits the full - conversion of heat ( radiation energy @xmath8 ) into work - energy ( or generation of pair - particles of energy @xmath9 ) and thus @xcite necessitates some residual energy ( @xmath10 ) to come - out . as described in the earlier- paper @xcite ; the inevitable consequence of second law of thermodynamics and spin - conservation necessitates the generation of a zero - spin photon ( @xmath10 ) in pair - production ( of electron and positron ) , which ( @xmath11 ) being unstable subsequently decays into a pair of neutrino and antineutrino .",

    "however , it can also be shown compatible ( permissible ) as feynman - diagrams as in figs.@xmath4 ( with three vertices ) and in fig.@xmath3 ( with five vertices ) .",
    "pairs - production can possibly occur in either way ; fig.@xmath3 is more likely , being symmetrical .",
    "herein it is assumed that the uncertainty - principle @xmath22 ( which permits violation of ` energy - conservation or the first law of thermodynamics ' for a moment ) also permits violation of second - law of thermodynamics as well , thus the @xmath15 can come - out after a moment from next - vertex to be in accordance with feynman - diagram , with only 3-lines on each vertex .",
    "infinity - problem ( divergence of the ` integral ' for amplitude _ m _ ) normally arises due the closed - loops in the higher - order feynman - diagrams , such a closed - loop situation for the electron - electron moller - scattering is shown in a conventional - way in fig.@xmath23 .",
    "the closed - loop comes due to ` pair - production ' and its subsequent ` annihilation ' therein .",
    "+   + to get rid of this infinity - problem , a set of procedure called ` re - normalization ' is adopted .",
    "the ` re - normalization ' though successful , seems dubious and has been criticized enough .",
    "the half - a - century - old problem of infinity has not been solved as yet , but rather it has only been ` managed ' through ` re - normalization ' .",
    "the present paper is an honest attempt which could possibly solve the infinity - problem without re - normalization , if the ` zero - spin photon hypothesis ' is incorporated into the closed loop of higher - order feynman - diagram , described as follows .          as discussed in the ` zero - spin photon hypothesis ' @xcite , revisited here in section-@xmath21 ; electron - positron pair - production from a photon ( @xmath14 )",
    "also necessitates generation of zero - spin photon ( @xmath24 ) which subsequently decays as pair - production of neutrino and antineutrino , making the whole process as ` two ' pair production(s ) referred simply as ` pairs - production ' .",
    "the feynman diagrams(figs.@xmath4 and @xmath3 ) of pairs - production with additional vertices could now be ` superimposed ' onto the closed - loop of the moller - scattering ( fig.@xmath23 ) .",
    "+   + thus two possible ( modified ) feynman - diagrams are produced with six or eight vertices as shown in figs.@xmath25 and @xmath26 respectively.it may be seen and noted ( and idiomatically said ) that the closed - loop ( the problematic viscous - circle ) is no longer smooth - curve but broken - down(in pieces ) and therefore the root - cause of the infinity - problem is broken ( the possible ` technical ' explanation for why the infinity - problem goes off is briefly mentioned in the next paragraph ) . +   +     on @xmath23,width=491,height=491 ]     on @xmath23 , width=377,height=491 ]",
    "due to more internal - line(s ) ( as in the figs.@xmath25 and @xmath26 ) more contributions will be there in the ` integrand ' through ` propagators ' , thus having more terms ( of internal four - momentum ` q ' ) in the denominator , it is therefore expected that the ` integral ' instead of being divergent would rather now be convergent ( possibly inverse dependence ) .",
    "this could thus solve the infamous infinity - problem altogether , making the need of ` re - normalization ' unnecessary or redundant .",
    "incorporating ` zero - spin photon hypothesis ' onto the conventional feynman diagram seems to make the diagram complex but solution cleaner .",
    "the zero - spin - photon , being unstable ( thus shown as dotted - wavy - line ) comes only for a short while to decay into the realistic neutrino and antineutrino ; thus from the internal - line - propagator point - of - view the wavy - lines may possibly be considered absent / omitted . +   + the authors invite the physicists of the world to tackle the modified feynman - diagrams ( fig.@xmath25 and @xmath26 ) rigorously .",
    "the ` zero - spin - photon'-path is laid down , directions for solution are indicated .",
    "it is to be seen who wins the race to be the first to ` actually ' solve the ` infinity - problem ' , of say , moller - scattering , without using the crutches of ` re - normalization ' ? also to be seen that how the two other types of loops in the feynman - diagrams ( those not discussed at all in the present - paper ) are to be tackled and who does that ?",
    "in addition ; the ` zero - spin photon ' - approach , for avoidance of infinity , may also be applied to other scattering - process and decay - process .",
    "` law(s ) of thermodynamics ' are not simply meant for engineers only .",
    "its greatness goes much beyond @xcite .",
    "it is said @xcite ` that the four laws of thermodynamics ( zeroth , first , second and third ) drives the universe , and that not knowing ( appreciating ) the second - law of thermodynamics is like never having read a work of shakespeare ' !",
    "interestingly , it has been shown [ 1 - 3 ] that though remotely distinct , ` second - law of thermodynamics ' and ` special - relativity ' are linked to each other .",
    "physicists have great respect for special - relativity and other physical - laws , but in - general ignore the importance of the second - law of thermodynamics .",
    "anyway , the ` zero - spin photon @xmath27 ' is much smaller than @xmath16 ; so should we bother about including @xmath28 ?",
    "it is true that , ` though most of small differences do nt make much of a difference , but even if the small difference pops up at crucial point then it can make all the difference ' @xcite .",
    "ignoring the second - law of thermodynamics is the basic etiology of the infinity - problem , which can be overcome if the zero - spin - photon ( which is the outcome of the second - law of thermodynamics ) is incorporated in the feynman - diagram .",
    "+   + the root cause of the infinity - problem is known to be the closed - loops in the higher - order feynman - diagrams .",
    "one such case considered in this paper is the moller - scattering ( fig.@xmath23 ) wherein the exchange - photon ( @xmath29 ) creates the electron - positron ( pair - production ) and its subsequent recombination ( annihilation ) results in a closed - loop in the diagram .",
    "` annihilation ' is thermodynamically okay ; but the simple ( single ) pair - production is , in a way , thermodynamically wrong or incomplete , it should be rather be pairs - production as mentioned in section @xmath21 .",
    "once the inclusion of ` zero - spin photon ' is made ( as in modified feynman - diagrams , figs.@xmath25 and @xmath26 ) to incorporate the correct pair(s ) - production , the problem of infinity should go away because the troublesome vicious - circle ( the smooth continuous closed - loop of the original feynman - diagram fig.@xmath23 ) is broken - down ( in pieces , as shown in the modified feynman - diagrams figs.@xmath25 and @xmath26 ) to first - order ( slope ) discontinuity .",
    "a few additional - vertices and internal - lines are thus introduced in the modified feynman - diagram(s ) , which would contribute via ` propagators ' possibly in such a way to have more powers of ` q ' in the denominator of the amplitude s ` integrand ' ultimately making the ` integral ' inversely convergent .",
    "the ill - behaved original integral should now become well behaved !",
    "+   + it is anticipated in the present paper , that the problem of infinity originating out of the smooth closed - loop ( as in fig.@xmath23 ) can most likely be solved with the incorporation of ` zero - spin photon ' hypotheses .",
    "the authors ask the physicists and graduated - students to analyze the new suggested ( modified ) feynman - diagrams with the broken - down loop ( figs.@xmath25 and @xmath26 ) ; the authors have indicated in the previous paragraph(s) how to possibly get the ` integral ' convergent thus avoid the infinity - problem altogether . but",
    "this is not the end of story .",
    "there are other two more types of loops which too cause divergence problem but these have neither been tackled nor answered in the present - paper .",
    "but at least , a new light of ` zero - spin - photon ' has been thrown - upon possibly in the right - direction which can illuminate the path .",
    "normally physicists bother much about momentum - conservation and energy - conservation ( ` first - law ' of thermodynamics ) , and that is what the feynman - calculus insures ; but the ` second - law ' of thermodynamics has completely been ignored .",
    "this non - consideration of second - law of thermodynamics is basically the origin and root - cause of the infinity - problem in qed ; therefore to avoid this disastrous problem , the right perspective of second - law of thermodynamics should be incorporated via ` zero - spin photon hypothesis ' , and that is what is done in the present paper by modifying the feynman - diagram accordingly .",
    "the herein proposed theory / approach seems to be in the right direction because it is in accordance with what dirac has said @xcite that ` with a good theory the infinity would never arise in the first place ' .",
    "it appears that the half - a - century - old infinity problem , which so far has only deem managed with re - normalization , can possibly be solved without re - normalization .",
    "the authors anticipate a wide - scale repercussions of this paper , as the suggested approach is expected to make changes in the shape and fate of the feynman - diagrams and the particle - physics .",
