    "by now , the thorough mathematical understanding of convergence and quasi - optimality of @xmath1-adaptive fem for second - order elliptic pdes has matured .",
    "however , the focus of the numerical analysis usually lies on model problems with homogeneous dirichlet conditions , i.e.  @xmath2 in @xmath3 with @xmath4 on @xmath5 , see e.g.  @xcite .",

    "is split into two relatively open boundary parts , namely the dirichlet boundary @xmath7 and the neumann boundary @xmath8 , i.e.  @xmath9 and @xmath10 . whereas @xmath8 is allowed to be empty .",
    "the given data formally satisfy @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 . as is usually required to derive ( localized ) a  posteriori error estimators , we assume additional regularity of the given data , namely @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 .",
    "the inclusion of inhomogeneous neumann conditions @xmath17 into the analysis seems to be obvious , incorporating inhomogeneous dirichlet conditions @xmath18 is technically more demanding and requires novel ideas .",
    "first , discrete finite element functions can not satisfy general inhomogeneous dirichlet conditions .",
    "therefore , the adaptive algorithm has to deal with an additional discretization @xmath19 of @xmath18 .",
    "second , this additional error has to be controlled in the natural trace space which is the fractional - order sobolev space @xmath20 .",
    "since the @xmath21-norm is non - local , the a  posteriori error analysis requires appropriate localization techniques .",
    "these have recently been developed in the context of adaptive boundary element methods  @xcite : under certain orthogonality properties of @xmath22 , the natural trace norm @xmath23 is bounded by a locally weighted @xmath24-seminorm @xmath25 . here , @xmath26 is the local mesh - width , and @xmath27 denotes the arclength derivative .",
    "finally , in contrast to homogeneous dirichlet conditions @xmath28 , we loose the galerkin orthogonality in energy norm .",
    "this leads to certain technicalities to derive a contractive quasi - error which is equivalent to the overall galerkin error in @xmath29 . in conclusion ,",
    "quasi - optimality and even plain convergence of adaptive fem with non - homogeneous dirichlet data is a nontrivial task . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "only  @xcite analyzes convergence of adaptive fem with inhomogeneous dirichlet data . while the authors also consider the 2d model problem   with @xmath30 and lowest - order elements , their analysis relies on an artificial non - standard marking criterion .",
    "quasi - optimal convergence rates are not analyzed and can hardly be expected in general  @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that the poisson problem   admits a unique weak solution @xmath31 with @xmath32 on @xmath7 in the sense of traces which solves the variational formulation @xmath33 here , the test space reads @xmath34 , and @xmath35 denotes the respective @xmath0-scalar products .      for the galerkin discretization ,",
    "let @xmath36 be a regular triangulation of @xmath3 into triangles @xmath37 .",
    "we use lowest - order conforming elements , where the ansatz space reads @xmath38 since a discrete function @xmath39 can not satisfy continuous dirichlet conditions , we have to discretize the given data @xmath15 . according to the sobolev inequality on the 1d manifold @xmath7 , the given dirichlet data are continuous on @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , the nodal interpoland @xmath19 of @xmath18 is well - defined . as is usually done in practice , we approximate @xmath41 . again , it is well - known that there is a unique @xmath42 with @xmath43 on @xmath7 which solves the galerkin formulation @xmath44 here , the test space is given by @xmath45 .",

    "the main ingredients of the proof are an equivalent error estimator @xmath62 for which we prove some estimator reduction @xmath63 see lemma  [ lemma : reduction ] , and a quasi - galerkin orthogonality in lemma  [ lemma : orthogonality ] , whereas the general concept follows that of  @xcite .",
