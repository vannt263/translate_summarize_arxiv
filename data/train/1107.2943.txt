    "<S> we observed the sh  2 - 233ir ( s233ir ) region with better sensitivity in near - infrared than previous studies for this region . by applying statistical subtraction of the background stars , we identified member sources and derived the age and mass of three distinguishable sub - groups in this region : sh  2 - 233ir ne , sh  2 - 233ir sw , and the `` distributed stars '' over the whole cloud . </S>",
    "<S> star formation may be occurring sequentially with a relatively small age difference ( @xmath0 myrs ) between subclusters . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the slopes for initial mass function ( @xmath1 ) of two subclusters are flatter than that of salpeter , which suggests that more massive stars were preferentially formed in those clusters compared to other galactic star - forming regions . </S>",
    "<S> these subclusters may not result from the overall collapse of the whole cloud , but have formed by triggering before the previous star formation activities disturbed the natal molecular cloud . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , high star formation efficiency ( @xmath240% ) of the subclusters may also suggest that stars form very efficiently in the center of ne . </S>"
