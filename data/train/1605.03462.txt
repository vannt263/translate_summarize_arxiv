    "these are required for forward modelling the observational data and facilitating ( model - dependent ) constraints on quantities of cosmological and astrophysical interest .",
    "a drawback of existing hydrodynamical simulations of the igm is their narrow dynamic range , which translates to simulation volumes of @xmath15@xmath16 due to the requirement of resolving structures with @xmath17 @xcite and spatial scales of @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "this requirement is problematic when simulating correlations in the igm on large scales , analysing the properties of absorption systems around rare , massive haloes , and correcting for the lack of large scale power in small simulation volumes .",
    "convergence at the @xmath19 per cent level in the forest power spectrum requires gas particle masses of @xmath20 and volumes @xmath21 to correctly capture the relevant large scale modes @xcite .",
    "in addition to achieving a sufficient dynamic range , it is important to assess how faithfully the hydrodynamical simulations reproduce the observational properties of the forest .",
    "although the overall agreement between high resolution spectroscopic data at @xmath22 and hydrodynamical simulations is astonishingly good , several discrepancies have been highlighted over the last few decades .",
    "these include absorption line velocity widths in the simulations which are too narrow @xcite , underdense gas that may be significantly hotter than typically assumed in the models @xcite , and too few absorption lines in the simulations with column densities @xmath23 @xcite .    in this work , we revisit these issues while introducing a new set of state - of - the - art hydrodynamical simulations of the igm  the sherwood simulation suite  performed with a modified version of the parallel tree - pm smoothed - particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code p - gadget-3 , an updated and extended version of the publicly available gadget-2 @xcite . these are some of the largest hydrodynamical simulations of the forest performed to date , in volumes @xmath0@xmath24 with up to @xmath25 ( 17.2 billion ) particles .",

    "the effect of later reionisation ( and hence less pressure smoothing ) and the suppression of small scale power by a warm dark matter thermal relic has a large impact on the forest at @xmath6 . decreasing the pressure smoothing scale acts on the pdf and power spectrum in the opposite direction to warm dark matter .",
    "it produces more pixels with @xmath206 in the pdf , and increases the power spectrum at scales @xmath100 .",
    "this indicates it should be possible to constrain the integrated thermal history during reionisation using the line of sight forest power spectrum at high redshift @xcite . *",
    "mock forest spectra extracted from hydrodynamical simulations are in better agreement with the observed pdf and power spectrum if a correction for the uncertain continuum normalisation is applied .",

    "* the simulations are in good agreement with the cddf of forest absorbers presented by @xcite at @xmath30 .",
    "the only discrepancies are that the simulations underpredict the number of weak lines with @xmath207 , and ( at @xmath90 only ) underpredict the incidence of saturated absorption lines with @xmath208 .",
    "we suggest the former may be due to unidentified metals and the detailed signal - to - noise properties of the data , whereas the latter agreement is improved ( but not resolved ) by including a sub - grid model for star formation and galactic winds . * the observed distribution of absorption line velocity widths @xcite is in good overall agreement with the simulations at @xmath90 and @xmath7 , although absorption lines with @xmath209 are underpredicted by the models .",

    "* the lower cut - off in the @xmath155@xmath180 distribution for lines with @xmath211 measured by @xcite and reanalysed by @xcite at @xmath8 is in broad agreement with our reference simulation , which has a temperature at mean density of @xmath191 at this redshift .",
    "however , a slightly lower value ( by @xmath212@xmath194 ) for the slope of temperature - density relation assumed in the models at this redshift , @xmath192 , may provide better agreement with the observational data at @xmath8 .",
    "we stress , however , that forest absorption lines at @xmath52 typically probe mildly overdense gas .",
