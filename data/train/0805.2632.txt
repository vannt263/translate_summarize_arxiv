    "the accuracy of the linear pt has been verified observationally by the temperature and polarization data of cmb measured by wmap @xcite .",

    "however , pt had never been applied to the real data such as 2dfgrs or sdss , as non - linearities are too strong for pt to be valid at low redshifts , @xmath5 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    ", however , pt is expected to perform better because of weaker non - linearity . in paper",
    "i we have shown that the matter power spectrum computed from the 3rd - order pt describes that from @xmath7-body simulations accurately .",
    "but , what about the _ galaxy _ power spectrum ?",
    "one may generally expect that , since non - linearities were milder in a high-@xmath8 universe , there should be a plenty of room for pt to be a good approximation . on the other hand , galaxies were more highly biased at higher redshifts for a given mass , and therefore one might suspect , somewhat naively , that non - linear bias could compromise the success of pt . in this paper",
    "we shall show that is not the case , and pt does provide a good approximation to the galaxy power spectrum at high redshifts .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in   [ sec : pt ] we give the formula for the 3rd - order pt galaxy power spectrum . in   [ sec : dm ] we compare the 3rd - order pt matter power spectrum with the matter power spectrum estimated from the millennium simulation @xcite , in order to confirm our previous results ( paper i ) with the millennium simulation . in ",

    "conclusion ] we give discussion and conclusions .",
    "galaxies are biased tracers of the underlying density field @xcite , which implies that the distribution of galaxies depends on the underlying matter density fluctuations in a complex way .",
    "this relation must depend upon the detailed galaxy formation processes , which are not yet understood completely .    however ,",
    "on large enough scales , one may approximate this function as a local function of the underlying density fluctuations , i.e. , the number density of galaxies at a given position in the universe is given solely by the underlying matter density at the same position . with this approximation",
    ", one may expand the density fluctuations of galaxies , @xmath10 , in terms of the underlying matter density fluctuations , as @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 are the galaxy bias parameters , and @xmath13 is a random variable that represents the `` stochasticity '' of the galaxy bias , i.e. , the relation between @xmath14 and @xmath15 is not deterministic , but contains some noise ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "we assume that the stochasticity is white noise , and is uncorrelated with the density fluctuations , i.e. , @xmath16 . while both of these assumptions should be violated at some small scales , we assume that these are valid assumptions on the scales that we are interested in  namely , on the scales where the 3rd - order pt describes the non - linear matter power spectrum with 1% accuracy . since both bias parameters and stochasticity evolve in time @xcite , we allow them to depend on redshifts .    one obtains the traditional `` linear bias model '' when the taylor series expansion given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : taylor_expansion ] ) is truncated at the first order and the stochasticity is ignored .",
    "the precise values of the galaxy bias parameters depend on the galaxy formation processes , and different types of galaxies have different galaxy bias parameters .",
    "however , we are _ not _ interested in the precise values of the galaxy bias parameters , but only interested in extracting cosmological parameters from the observed galaxy power spectra with _ all the bias parameters marginalized over_.      the analysis in this paper adopts the framework of @xcite , and we briefly summarize the result for clarity . we shall use the 3rd - order pt ; thus , we shall keep the terms up to the 3rd order in @xmath17 .",

    "we will never have to deal with the original coefficients , @xmath34 , @xmath31 , @xmath35 , or @xmath13 . with the original coefficients , see @xcite . ] instead , we will only use the re - parametrized bias parameters , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , as these are related more directly to the observables . as shown by @xcite , in the large - scale limit , @xmath36 , one finds @xmath37 therefore , in the large - scale limit one recovers the traditional linear bias model plus the constant term . note that @xmath28 is the same as what is called the `` effective bias '' in @xcite .    throughout this paper",
    "we shall use eq .",
    "( [ eq:3rd_pt_pk ] ) for calculating the non - linear galaxy power spectra .",
    "the precise values of the galaxy bias parameters depend on the details of the galaxy formation and evolution , as well as on galaxy types , luminosities , and so on .",
    "however , our goal is to extract the cosmological information from the observed galaxy power spectra , without having to worry about which galaxies we are using as tracers of the underlying density field .    therefore , we will marginalize the likelihood function over the bias parameters , without ever paying attention to their precise values .",
    "is this approach sensible ?",
    "one might hope that one should be able to calculate the bias parameters for given properties of galaxies from the first principles using , e.g. , sophisticated numerical simulations .",
    "less numerically expensive way of doing the same thing would be to use the semi - analytical halo model approach , calibrated with a smaller set of numerical simulations ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) . using the peak - background split method @xcite based upon the excursion set approach @xcite",
    ", one can calculate @xmath34 , @xmath31 , @xmath35 , etc .",
    ", the coefficients of the taylor series expansion given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : taylor_expansion ] ) , for the density of dark matter halos .",
    "once the bias parameters for dark matter halos are specified , the galaxy bias parameters may be calculated using the so - called halo occupation distribution ( hod ) @xcite .",
    "@xcite have attempted this approach , and shown that it is difficult to calculate even the power spectrum of dark matter halos that matches @xmath7-body simulations .",
    "the halo - model predictions for bias parameters are not yet accurate enough , and we do not yet have a correct model for @xmath30 .    the situation would be even worse for the galaxy power spectrum , as we would have to model the hod in addition to the halo bias . at the moment",
    "the form of hod is basically a free empirical function .",
    "we therefore feel that it is dangerous to rely on our limited understanding of these complications for computing the bias parameters .",
    "this is the reason why we have decided to give up predicting the precise values of bias parameters entirely .",
    "instead , we shall treat 3 bias parameters , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , as free parameters , and fit them to the observed galaxy power spectra simultaneously with the cosmological parameters .",
    "the most important question that we must ask is the following , `` using the 3rd - order pt with 3 bias parameters , can we extract the correct cosmological parameters from the galaxy power spectra ? ''",
    "if the answer is yes , we will not have to worry about the precise values of bias parameters anymore .",
    "in this section we show that the matter power spectrum computed from the 3rd - order pt agrees with that estimated from the millennium simulation @xcite .",
    "this result confirms our previous finding ( paper i ) .    using the result obtained in this section we define the maximum wavenumber , @xmath38 , below which the 3rd - order pt may be trusted .",
    "the matter power spectrum gives an unambiguous definition of @xmath38 , which will then be used thereafter when we analyze power spectra of halos and galaxies in   [ sec : galaxy ] .",
    "the millennium simulation @xcite is a large @xmath7-body simulation with the box size of @xmath39 and @xmath40 dark matter particles .",
    "the cosmological parameters used in the simulation are @xmath41 .",
    "the primordial power spectrum used in the simulation is the scale - invariant peebles - harrison - zeldovich spectrum , @xmath42 , and the linear r.m.s .",
    "density fluctuation smoothed with a top - hat filter of radius @xmath43 is @xmath44 .",
    "note that these values are significantly larger than the latest values found from the wmap 5-year data , @xmath45 and @xmath46 @xcite , which implies that non - linearities in the millennium simulation should be stronger than those in our universe .",
    "the millennium simulation was carried out using the gadget code @xcite .",
    "the gadget uses the tree particle mesh ( tree - pm ) gravity solver , which tends to have a larger dynamic range than the traditional pm solver for the same box size and the same number of particles ( and meshes)@xcite .",
    "therefore , the matter power spectrum from the millennium simulation does not suffer from an artificial suppression of power as much as those from the pm codes .",
    "the initial particle distribution was generated at the initial redshift of @xmath47 using the standard zeldovich approximation . while the initial conditions generated from the standard zeldovich approximation",
    "tend to produce an artificial suppression of power at later times , and the higher - order scheme such as the second - order lagrangian perturbation theory usually produces better results @xcite , the initial redshift of the millennium simulation , @xmath47 , is reasonably high for the resulting power spectra to have converged in the weakly non - linear regime .",
    "the mass of each dark matter particle in the simulation is @xmath48 .",
    "they require at least 20 particles per halo for their halo finder , and thus the minimum mass resolution of halos is given by @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , the millennium simulation covers the mass range that is relevant to real galaxy surveys that would detect galaxies with masses in the range of @xmath50 .",
    "this property distinguishes our study from the previous studies on non - linear distortion of baos due to galaxy bias ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , whose mass resolution was greater than @xmath51 .",
    "in addition to the dark matter halos , the millennium database[multiblock footnote omitted ] also provides galaxy catalogues from two different semi - analytic galaxy formation models @xcite .",
    "these catalogues give us an excellent opportunity for testing validity of the non - linear galaxy power spectrum model based upon the 3rd - order pt with the unprecedented precision .",
    "first , we compare the matter power spectrum from the millennium simulation with the 3rd - order pt calculation .",
    "the matter power spectrum we use here was measured directly from the millennium simulation on the fly .",

    "i we have defined @xmath38 such that the fractional difference between pt and the average of @xmath55 simulations is 1% . here , we have only one realization , and thus the results are subject to statistical fluctuations that might be peculiar to this particular realization .",

    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the fractional differences at @xmath56 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , and 6 . since we have only one realization , we can not compute statistical errors from the standard deviation of multiple realizations . therefore ,",

    "this feature is due to the limitation of the standard 3rd order pt .",

    "we also give the values of @xmath65 , for which @xmath66 ( criteria recommended in paper i ) .",

    "however , the formula for @xmath28 includes the mass variance , @xmath135 , which depends on our choice of a smoothing scale that is not well defined .",
    "this shows how difficult it is to actually compute the halo power spectrum from the halo model .",
    "while the measured values of @xmath28 and the predicted @xmath128 compare reasonably well , it is clear that we can not use the predicted bias values for doing cosmology .    for @xmath29 ,",
    "we compute @xmath136 where @xmath28 is the best - fitting value from the millennium simulation .",
    "this would give us a semi apple - to - apple comparison .",
    "nevertheless , while the agreement is reasonable at @xmath125 , the halo model predictions should not be used for predicting @xmath29 either .",
    "while the degeneracy between bias parameters may appear to be a serious issue , there is actually a powerful way of breaking degeneracy : the bispectrum , the fourier transform of the 3-point correlation function @xcite .",
    "the reduced bispectrum , which is the bispectrum normalized properly by the power spectrum , depends primarily on two bias parameters , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , nearly independent of the cosmological parameters @xcite .",
    "therefore , one can use this property to fix the bias parameters , and use the power spectrum for determining the cosmological parameters and the remaining bias parameter , @xmath30 . @xcite",
    "have shown that the planned high-@xmath8 galaxy surveys would be able to determine @xmath28 and @xmath29 with a few percent accuracy .",
    "we have begun studying the bispectrum of the millennium simulation .",
    "our preliminary results show that we can indeed obtain better constraints on @xmath28 and @xmath29 from the bispectrum than from the power spectrum , provided that we use the same @xmath38 for both the bispectrum and power spectrum analyses .",
    "therefore , even when the non - linear bias parameters are poorly constrained by the power spectrum alone , or have the double - peak likelihood function from the power spectrum for lower @xmath38 , we can still find tight constraints on @xmath28 and @xmath29 from the bispectrum .",
    "these results will be reported elsewhere .      in figure  [ fig9 ]",
    "we show the distortion of bao features due to non - linear matter clustering and non - linear bias . to show only the distortions of baos at each redshift , we have divided",
    "the halo power spectra by smooth power spectra without baryonic oscillations from equation ( 29 ) of @xcite with @xmath137 multiplied .",
    "three theoretical models are shown : the non - linear bias model ( _ solid line _ ) , a linear bias model with the 3rd - order matter power spectrum ( _ dashed line _ ) , and a linear bias model with the linear matter power spectrum ( _ dot - dashed line _ ) . therefore , the difference between the solid lines and the dashed lines is solely due to non - linear halo bias .",
    "the importance of non - linear bias affecting baos grows with @xmath8 ; however , as the matter clustering is weaker at higher @xmath8 , the 3rd - order pt still performs better than at lower @xmath8 . in other words , the higher bias at higher",
    "@xmath8 does not mean that surveys at higher @xmath8 are worse at measuring baos ; on the contrary , it is still easier to model the halo power spectrum at higher @xmath8 than at lower @xmath8 .",
    "for @xmath64 , where @xmath38 is larger than the bao scale , the distortion of baos is modeled very well by the non - linear bias model , while the linear bias models fail badly .",
    "the sampling variance of the millennium simulation at @xmath138 is too large for us to study the distortion on the first two bao peaks .",
    "since the pt performs well at higher @xmath59 , we expect that the pt describes the first two peaks even better .",
    "however , to show this explicitly one would need to run a bigger simulation with a bigger volume with the same mass resolution as the millennium simulation , which should be entirely doable with the existing computing resources .",

    "the same is true for @xmath29 for @xmath140 , while it is not as apparent for lower redshifts , and eventually becomes almost fuzzy for @xmath56 .",

    "the pt galaxy power spectrum model fails only when @xmath148 exceeds @xmath149 ( paper i ) , or the locality of bias is violated .",

    "it may seem that it should not be so difficult to fit smooth curves like those shown in , e.g. , figure  [ fig10 ] .    while the quality of fits is important , it is not the end of story .",
    "we must also show that eq .",
    "( [ eq:3rd_pt_pk ] ) can be used for extracting the _ correct cosmological parameters _ from the observed galaxy power spectra .    in this section",
    "we shall extract the distance scale from the galaxy power spectra of the millennium simulation , and compare them with the input values that were used to generate the simulation . if they do not agree , eq .",
    "( [ eq:3rd_pt_pk ] ) must be discarded .",
    "if they do , we should proceed to the next level by including non - linear redshift space distortion .",
    "dark energy influences the expansion rate of the universe as well as the growth of structure ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a recent review ) .",
    "the cosmological distances , such as the luminosity distance , @xmath150 , and angular diameter distance , @xmath2 , are powerful tools for measuring the expansion rates of the universe , @xmath3 , over a wide range of redshifts .",
    "indeed , it was @xmath150 measured out to high-@xmath8 ( @xmath151 ) type ia supernovae that gave rise to the first compelling evidence for the existence of dark energy @xcite .",

    "the galaxy power spectrum can be used for measuring @xmath2 as well as @xmath3 over a wider range of redshifts . from galaxy surveys we find three - dimensional positions of galaxies by measuring their angular positions on the sky as well as their redshifts .",
    "we can then estimate the two - point correlation function of galaxies as a function of the angular separation , @xmath154 , and the redshift separation , @xmath155 . to convert @xmath154 and @xmath155 into the comoving separations perpendicular to the line of sight , @xmath156 , and those along the line of sight , @xmath157",
    ", one needs to know @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively , as @xmath158 where @xmath159 appears because @xmath2 is the proper ( physical ) angular diameter distance , whereas @xmath156 is the comoving separation .",
    "therefore , if we know @xmath156 and @xmath157 _ a priori _ , then we may use the above equations to measure @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the galaxy power spectra contain at least three distance scales which may be used in the place of @xmath156 and @xmath157 : ( i ) the sound horizon size at the so - called baryon drag epoch , @xmath160 , at which baryons were released from the baryon - photon plasma , ( ii ) the photon horizon size at the matter - radiation equality , @xmath161 , and ( iii ) the silk damping scale ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the baos contain the information of one of the standard rulers , the sound horizon size at @xmath168 .",
    "this method relies on measuring only the phases of baos , which are markedly insensitive to all the non - linear effects ( clustering , bias , and redshift space distortion ) @xcite , despite the fact that the amplitude is distorted by non - linearities ( see figures  [ fig4 ] , [ fig9 ] , [ fig12 ] , and [ fig13 ] ) .",
    "therefore , baos provide a robust means to measure @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and they have been used for determining @xmath169 out to @xmath170 from the sdss main galaxy sample and 2dfgrs , as well as to @xmath171 from the sdss luminous red galaxy ( lrg ) sample @xcite ; however , since they use only one standard ruler , the constraints on @xmath2 and @xmath3 from the bao - only analysis are weaker than the full analysis @xcite .",
    "* use the _ entire _ shpae of the power spectrum .",
    "this approach gives the best determination ( i.e. , the smallest error ) of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , as it uses all the standard rulers encoded in the galaxy power spectrum ; however , one must understand the distortions of the shape of the power spectrum due to non - linear effects .",
    "the question is , `` is the 3rd - order ( or higher ) pt good enough for correcting the key non - linear effects ? ''    in this paper we show , for the first time , that we can extract the distance scale using the 3rd - order pt galaxy power spectrum in real space . while we have not yet included the effects of redshift space distortion , this is a significant step towards extracting @xmath2 and @xmath3 from the entire shape of the power spectrum of galaxies .",
    "we shall address the effect of non - linear redshift space distortion in the future work .      in real space simulations ( as opposed to redshift space ones ) , there is only one distance scale in the problem : the box size of the simulation , @xmath172 , which is @xmath173 for the millennium simulation . then , `` estimating the distance scale from the millennium simulation '' becomes equivalent to  estimating @xmath174 from the millennium simulation .",
    "( [ eq : pkdahz ] ) now leads : @xmath175    as we estimate the variance of power spectrum from the observed power spectrum , we need to rescale the variance when the normalization of the observed power spectrum changes : @xmath176    we estimate @xmath172 using the likelihood function given by @xmath177,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath178 .    the likelihood function , eq .",

    "we find @xmath181 to within the 1-@xmath33 errors from _ all of the halo / galaxy catalogues _ at _ all redshifts _ , provided that we use @xmath96 only up to @xmath38 that has been determined unambiguously from the matter power spectrum ( see table  [ table : kmax ] ) .",
    "not only does this provide a strong support for the validity of eq .",
    "( [ eq:3rd_pt_pk ] ) , but also it provides a practical means for extracting @xmath1 from the full shape of the observed galaxy power spectra .    despite a small volume of the millennium simulation and the use of flat priors on the bias parameters upon marginalization , we could determine @xmath1 to about 2.5% accuracy .",
    "in addition , we also find that the error on @xmath1 hardly decreases even though @xmath38 increases .",
    "it is because of the degeneracy between @xmath1 and the bias parameters . in order to see how strongly degenerate they are ,",
    "we calculate correlations between pairs of parameters ( @xmath28,@xmath29,@xmath30,@xmath182 ) by the fisher information matrix from eq .",
    "( [ eq : fisher_bias ] ) .    figure [ fig17 ] shows both one - dimensional marginalized constraints and two - dimensional joint marginalized constraints of 2-@xmath33 range ( @xmath120 cl ) for the bias parameters and the distance scale .",
    "this figure indicates that when we include the distance scale , the correlations between bias parameters become milder .",
    "it is mainly due to the correlation between the distance scale and @xmath28 making the constraint on @xmath28 weaker . on the other hand ,",
    "the one - dimensional marginalized likelihood functions for @xmath29 and @xmath30 are hardly changed .",
    "the remaining degeneracies are those between ( @xmath29,@xmath30 ) and ( @xmath28,@xmath182 ) .",
    "these degeneracies would be broken when we include the information from the bispectrum , as the bispectrum will measure @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the constraint we find from the previous subsection will get better when we include the bispectrum , as the reduced bispectrum provides independent and strong constraints on @xmath28 and @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "how much will it be better ?",
    "first , let us assume that we know the exact values of @xmath28 and @xmath29 . in this case ,",
    "we get the error on @xmath1 by marginalizing only over @xmath30 while setting @xmath28 and @xmath29 to be the best - fitting values , i.e. @xmath183 where @xmath184 and @xmath185 denote the best - fitting values of @xmath28 and @xmath29 for each @xmath38 , respectively . in figure [ fig18 ] , we show @xmath182 estimated from eq .",

    "note that the uncertainties on @xmath182 decrease as @xmath38 increases as expected .",
    "the reason is because fixing @xmath28 and @xmath29 breaks the degeneracy between them and the distance scale .    in reality , the bias parameters estimated from the bispectrum have finite errors , and thus the accuracy of extracting @xmath1 will be somewhere in between figure [ fig16 ] and figure [ fig18 ] .",
    "the result of the full analysis including both power spectrum and bispectrum of millennium simulation will be reported elsewhere .    in the ideal situation where we completely understand the complicated halo / galaxy formation , we may be able to calculate the three bias parameters from the first principle .",
    "ideal _ determination of bias parameters will provide more accurate constraints on the distance scale @xmath1 . in this case , we get the likelihood function by fixing all the bias parameters to their best - fitting values : @xmath190 by knowing all the bias parameters , we can extract the distance scale @xmath1 to @xmath191 accuracy for @xmath187 .",
    "the error decreases further to @xmath192 for @xmath189 .",
    "( see figure ( [ fig19 ] ) )      the planned future surveys would cover a larger volume than the millennium simulation . also , since the real surveys would be limited by their continuum / flux sensitivity , they would not be able to detect all galaxies that were resolved in the millennium simulation . in this subsection",
    "we explore how the constraints would be affected by the volume and the number of objects .    to simulate the mock data , we take a simplified approach : we take our best - fitting power spectrum at @xmath193 , i.e. , eq .",
    "( [ eq:3rd_pt_pk ] ) fit to the power spectrum of mpa halos in the millennium simulation at @xmath193 , and add random gaussian noise to it with the standard deviation given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : varpk ] ) . to compute the standard deviation we need to specify the survey volume , which determines the fundamental wavenumber , @xmath84 , as @xmath194 .",
    "we use the volume that would be surveyed by the hetdex survey @xcite , @xmath195 , which is 27 times as large as the volume of the millennium simulation .",
    "we then vary the number of galaxies , @xmath196 , which determines the shot noise as @xmath197 .",

    "we show @xmath182 as a function of @xmath38 and @xmath199 . for @xmath200 , which gives the same number density as the millennium simulation ,",
    "the projected error on @xmath1 is 0.3% , or 8 times better than the original result presented in figure  [ fig16 ] .",
    "since the volume is 27 times bigger , the statistics alone would reduce the error by a factor of about 5 .",
    "the other factor of about 1.5 comes from the fact that the variance of the distance scale estimated from the millennium simulation lies on the tail of the distribution of the variance of the distance scale , ( see , appendix c ) while the error estimated from the hetdex volume mock is close to the peak of pdf of the variance .",
    "however , real surveys will not get as high the number density as the millennium simulation .",

    "* when 3 galaxy bias parameters , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , are marginalized over , the 3rd - order pt galaxy power spectrum fit to the millennium simulation yields the correct ( unbiased ) distance scale to within the statistical error of the simulation , @xmath206 .",
    "these results suggest that the 3rd - order pt provides us with a practical means to extract the cosmological information from the observed galaxy power spectra at high redshifts , i.e. , @xmath6 , accurately .",
    "we would like to emphasize that our approach does not require simulations to calibrate the model .",
    "the 3rd - order pt is based upon the solid physical framework , and the only assumption made for the galaxy formation is that it is a local process , at least on the scales where the 3rd - order pt is valid , i.e. , @xmath139 .",
    "the only serious drawback so far is that the 3rd - order pt breaks down at low redshifts , and thus it can not be applied to the current generation of survey data such as 2dfgrs and sdss .",

    "the practical application of our approach may proceed as follows :    * measure the galaxy power spectra at various redshifts .",

    "there are limitations in our present study , however .",
    "first , a relatively small volume of the millennium simulation does not allow us to make a precision test of the 3rd - order pt .",
    "also , this limitation does not allow us to study constraints on more than one cosmological parameter .",
    "we have picked @xmath1 as the representative example because this parameter seems the most interesting one in light of the future surveys whose primary goal is to constrain the properties of dark energy . in the future",
    "we must use larger simulations to show convincingly that the bias in cosmological parameters is much lower than 1% level .",
    "second , we have found that , due to the limited statistics of a small volume and the smaller @xmath38 due to stronger non - linearities , the bias parameters are not determined very well from the galaxy power spectra alone at @xmath126 .",
    "this issue should disappear by including the bispectrum in the joint analysis .",
    "last and foremost , our study has been restricted to the real space power spectra : we have not addressed the non - linearities in redshift space distortion .",
