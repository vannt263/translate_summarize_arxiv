    "the origin of the ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) beyond 100 eev has still been an enigma in modern astrophysics .",
    "uhecrs are frequently accompanied by significant fluxes of energetic neutrinos generated in processes associated with hadronic interactions .",
    "although the source direction of cosmic rays with energy above 60 eev can be identified by an analysis of recent auger data ( abraham et al .",
    "2007 ) , neutrinos are regarded as being the most useful probe of their source confirmation owing to no deflection by galactic / intergalactic magnetic fields and the weakest reduction by interactions with the cosmic background radiation .",
    "the models for the origin of the highest energy cosmic rays are classified into two categories : top - down and bottom - up . in top - down scenarios ,",
    "neutrinos are presumed to be decay or annihilation products of cosmological remnants with the grand unified energy scale of @xmath0 gev . within this framework",
    ", numerous models have been proposed so far , such as topological defects , z - bursts , annihilation of dark matter particles and so on ( for a review , see @xcite ) . in an alternative approach , the bottom - up model is based on the idea that the highest energy cosmic rays are generated by astrophysical objects .",
    "the most plausible candidates are gamma ray bursts ( grb : @xcite ) and active galactic nuclei ( agn : @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to these objects , it is pointed out that uhecrs are also produced via stochastic acceleration in the giant lobes of radio galaxy ( cen a : @xcite ) , which accounts for the past year discovery by the hires and auger collaborations .",
    "supernova remnants , x - ray binaries , mini - quasars ( e.g.  @xcite , for a review ) , and soft gamma ray repeaters ( sgr : @xcite ) can also be stellar type neutrino sources , any of which could produce observable fluxes of energetic neutrinos .",
    "if protons are accelerated at these astrophysical objects , neutrinos are expected to be produced in collisions with ambient photons or protons .",
    "some of the above - mentioned models predict neutrino flux at the level of a few events per km@xmath1 year .",
    "the upper range of this estimation seems to be within reach of a first - generation neutrino telescope , such as amanda ( antarctic muon and neutrinos detector array ) . among a wide variety of physics topics to be explored with the neutrino telescope ,",
    "the most important goal is to search for the origin of cosmic radiation , especially that originated from agn and/or grb . for this purpose",
    ", amanda has been primarily optimised in the energy range from tev to pev , targeting not only the diffuse , but point source , flux of energetic neutrinos .",
    "according to an analysis of amanda data , we unfortunately have no evidence for point sources so far , ( woschnagg et al . 2005 ; abbasi et al . 2009 ) , except for a temporal coincidence with an orphan flare of the tev blazar , 1es 1959 + 650 ( halzen & hooper 2005 ) .",
    "the icecube , a cubic kilometre - scale neutrino telescope , which is partly operating and still under construction as a successor to amanda at the same site , is designed to detect the fluxes about 10 - 50 events per km@xmath1 year .",
    "similar event rates are predicted by model calculations assuming that agn or grb are the actual source ( halzen 2005 ) and hence the icecube is expected to certainly detect neutrino fluxes from such point sources . in order to observe a _ guaranteed _ source , however , even the km@xmath2-sized detector should safely operate over a period of at least ten years .    as for the cosmic accelerators , the most promising mechanism to lead highest energies and power - law energy spectrum",
    "is considered to be of diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa : @xcite ) .",
    "solar energetic particles and galactic cosmic rays are consistently explained by this mechanism applied to shocks at heliosphere and supernova remnants , respectively ( for a review , see @xcite ) ; these acceleration sites have actually been confirmed by some observations ( koyama et al .",
    "polarization data in the range of radio to optical wavelengths imply that _ in situ _ acceleration of electrons ( and possibly ions ) must also be taking place in the knots of agn jets ( honda & honda 2004a ) or in the hot spots of fanaroff - riley type - ii ( fr - ii ) sources ( probably terminal shocks ) ( perley et al . 1984 ; carilli & barthel 1996 ) . at these sites , magnetic fields in the vicinity of a shock front",
    "plays an essential role in particle acceleration .",
    "a detailed configuration of the fields in extragalactic jets has been revealed by polarization measurements using very long - baseline interferometry .",
    "for example , the quite smooth fields predominantly transverse to the jet axis , are typically observed in the core region of bl lac objects ( 1803 + 784 : @xcite ; 0300 + 470 : @xcite ) .",
    "allowing the propagation of a shock wave through the jets , this implies the establishment of a ( quasi- ) perpendicular shock , which is capable of accelerating cosmic ray particles efficiently .",
    "evidence for large - scale toroidal magnetic fields has been also discovered in the galactic center ( gc ) region ( novak et al .",
    "based on the above results , it seems adequate that system of magnetized filaments has been established in blazar jets as well .",
    "we have suggested a theoretical model to account for the generation of such a large - scale toroidal ( transverse ) magnetic field in astrophysical jets ( honda & honda 2002 ) . in this model ,",
    "huge currents launched from a central engine are broken into many filaments whose transverse sizes are self - adjusted for the electromagnetic current filamentation instability ( cfi : @xcite and references therein ) . in the nonlinear stage of the cfi , the magnetized filaments are often regarded as being strong turbulence that can largely deflect charged particles . allowing shock propagation through the jet ,",
    "the particles are expected to be quite efficiently accelerated for the dsa scenario , which appears to be favorably taking place in the agn jets .",
    "indeed , some knots of a radio galaxy jet are associated with the shock fronts ( m87 : @xcite ) and circumstantial evidence for in - situ acceleration of electrons ( meisenheimer et al .",
    "1989 ) have been found .",
    "it was also pointed that a similar pattern of small - scale quasi - static magnetic fields can also be established by some numerical simulations : e.g. , during the collision of electron - positron plasmas existing in snrs , pulsar winds , grbs , relativistic jets , and so on ( kazimura et al .",
    "1998 ; silva et al . 2003 ) . using a three - dimensional relativistic electromagnetic code ,",
    "nishikawa ( 2003 ) show that non - uniform small - scale magnetic field is generated due to the weibel instability at a jet front propagating through an ambient plasma with / without initial fields .",
    "these dynamics might be involved in some of the knots in the fr - i radio jets , which appear to be a shock established when faster material is overtaking with slower one ( m87 : @xcite ) .    in the case of blazars , however , the detailed internal structure of their jets has still not been confirmed because of optical thickness with respect to the observer s line of sight .",
    "another approach to shed light on their configuration is provided by the remarkable short variability timescale of a blazar light curve ( e.g. , mrk 421 : reaching a few minutes , @xcite ) .",
    "this is significantly shorter than the light - crossing time at the black hole horizon , which implies the presence of some substructure in the parsec - scale jet . according to our model configuration of the filamentary jet ,",
    "the strength of the local magnetic field is described by a power - law of the filaments transverse sizes .",
    "if charged particles are injected into this system , they are diffusively accelerated by a collisionless shock being scattered by the field fluctuations .",
    "since the efficiency of the acceleration and loss depends upon the spatial size scales , the local maximum energies of accelerated particles are also characterized by their nearest filament sizes .",
    "the spectrum extending to the x - ray region is attributed to the synchrotron radiation of accelerated electrons . in particular",
    ", the correlation between x - ray and gamma - ray light curves of mrk 421 is well reproduced by a model of the hierachical turbulent structure of the jet ( honda 2008 ) .",
    "the most interesting consequence is that the transition of a hierachical turbulent structure seems to be responsible for the observed patterns of energy - dependent light curves , e.g. , soft lag ( takahashi et al .",
    "1996 ; rebillot et al .",
    "2006 ) or hard lag ( fossati et al . 2000 ) and a tight - correlation mode ( sembay et al .",
    "2002 ) .    as for mrk 501 ,",
    "which is also firmly established as a tev @xmath3-ray emitter , the x - ray light curve shows a very rapid flare varying over several 100 seconds ( catanese & sambruna 2000 ) .",
    "it is also revealed that the tev flares correlate with x - ray radiation on timescales of hours or less from multiwavelengths observations ( pian et al .",
    "1998 ; catanese et al . 1997 ; krawczynski et al .",
    "2000 ; sambruna et al .",
    "moreover , the largest shift of the peak energy during the peak - luminosity change was observed among all blazars ( kataoka et al .",
    "2001 ) . summarizing these observational results",
    ", we can say that the acceleration of electrons similar to mrk 421 is also taking place in mrk 501 . presuming a finite ion abundance in the jet of mrk 501 ( rawlings & saunders 1991 ) , such a dsa mechanism operates for arbitrary nuclei ( of course including protons ) as well .",
    "indeed , from the x - ray spectrum of ss 433 jet , emission lines of various elements such as ne , mg , si , and fe were observed ( kotani et al .",
    "1996 ) .    in the present paper",
    ", we evaluate the achievable maximum energy of protons in the mrk 501 jet to estimate the resultant neutrino fluxes in accordance with our diffusion and acceleration mechanism in a filamentary jet , which we have proposed and developed in a series of papers ( honda & honda 2004b ; 2005 ; 2007 ) . in section 2 , installing our model structure of magnetized filaments to the jet of mrk 501 , we describe the acceleration proccesses of protons using our novel dsa mechanism . taking competitive energy losses and restrictions into consideration , we present the scaling of the maximum energy . in ",
    "2.1 we describe the acceleration taking place at local magnetic fields induced by the current filament each ( referred to as preliminary acceleration ) and in  2.2 the additional acceleration due to the inter - filaments deflection . in  2.3 , we calculate the achievable maximum energies of accelerated protons with respect to the transverse filament sizes and magnetic field parameters .",
    "we then evaluate neutrino flux from mrk 501 and discuss its detectability based on a km - scale neutrino telescope such as icecube in section 3 .",
    "conclusions are summarized in section 4 .",
    "suppose a parsec - scale blazar jet transporting energetic particles from the central engine .",
    "the directional plasma flow will favorably induce huge currents ( appl & camenzind 1992 ) that breaks up into many filaments because of electromagnetic cfi .",
    "each filament generates a small - scale transverse magnetic field whose strength is determined by the transverse size of a filament , @xmath4 , i.e. , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 ; @xmath7 and @xmath8 denote the jet diameter and power - law spectral index of the magnetized filamentary turbulence , respectively ( honda & honda 2007 ) . viewing the jet globally from outside ,",
    "randomly oriented fields inside jet are cancelled , except for a large - scale toroidal magnetic field along the envelope .",
    "as was illustrated in our previous paper ( honda & honda 2005 ) , there exists an energy hierarchy for protons trapped in such a filamentary current system : ( i ) @xmath9 and ( ii ) @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the charge of an electron and the vector potential , respectively . the former corresponds to a low - energy regime , in which protons are strictly bounded for the local magnetic field induced by each filament .",
    "the latter reflects the higher energy regime in which the validity condition of the quasilinear approximation , @xmath13 is satisfied , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the averaged and fluctuated part of the momentum distribution function for protons in the test - particle approximation , @xmath16 , respectively . in this regime , protons are no longer trapped with local magnetic fields , but are deviated with small fluctuations .",
    "below , we describe the acceleration and competitive energy losses in each energy hierarchy .      in the low - energy regime of @xmath17 , protons are strictly bounded and gyrating around the local magnetic field induced by each filament .",
    "energies of injected protons are elevated via the conventional diffusive shock acceleration being resonantly scattered from small magnetic fluctuations ( drury 1983 ) .",
    "the characteristic acceleration time of protons is described by @xmath18 where @xmath19 , presuming kolmogorov turbulence , @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) is the energy density ratio of fluctuating to local mean magnetic fields , @xmath22 is the proton gyroradius , and @xmath23 ( = 4 for the strong shock limit ) is the shock compression ratio .",
    "the achievable maximum energies of protons are limited by the various radiative cooling timescales , and here we consider two representatives : the synchrotron radiation losses , @xmath24 , and collisions with ambient photons , @xmath25 . in blazar jets",
    "the propagation time of shock , @xmath26 , also restricts the highest energy , and hence the temporal limit is given by @xmath27 besides the temporal limit , there exists a spatial limit : the maximum gyroradii of protons are not allowed to exceed the transverse sizes of in - situ filaments . the achievable energy of protons via the preliminary acceleration is determined by comparing the temporal and spatial limit . in the following , conceivable energy constraints for mrk 501 are provided .",
    "gyrating around the filament - induced local fields , and being scattered by small fluctuations , protons emit synchrotron photons , which can be a dominant cooling process when the energy density of the magnetic field is sufficiently greater than that of the radiation .",
    "the characteristic loss time for proton synchrotron is given by ( rybicki & lightman 1979 ) @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the masses of a proton and of an electron , respectively ; @xmath31 is the cross section for thomson scattering and @xmath32 is the lorentz factor of accelerated protons .",
    "the average energy density of the local magnetic field is denoted by @xmath33 , where @xmath34 .",
    "it should be noted that the adopted field value of @xmath35 g ( tavecchio & maraschi 2001 ) is not the one averaged over the compact blob but the maximum for a filament whose radial size is compared to the jet diameter .",
    "we consider proton - photon collisions leading to a pion - production cascade .",
    "since the collision timescale is characterized by the target photon spectrum , which is still unknown , we adopt here a description by a single power - law : @xmath36 ( @xcite ) , where @xmath37 is the number density of photons per unit energy interval @xmath38 .",
    "then , the timescale can be expressed as @xmath39 where @xmath40 erg@xmath41 ( @xcite ) is the average energy density of target photon fields and @xmath42 ( @xcite ) . since @xmath43 , it is found that @xmath44 .",
    "we should also check whether collisions with particles ( especially , with protons ) becomes effective or not .",
    "the characteristic cooling time of relativistic protons due to inelastic pp collisions can be written as ( @xcite ) @xmath45 where the number density of the target hydrogen medium , @xmath46 @xmath41 , corresponds to the upper limit assuming mass loaded hadronic jet models .",
    "the averaged total cross section , @xmath47 , is approximately 40 mb at very high energies , and @xmath48 is the coefficient of inelasticity",
    ". it would be fair to say that collisions with protons should not be taken into consideration .",
    "the achievable maximum energy of protons is also restricted by the duration that the shock is propagating through the jet from the central engine to the working surface .",
    "this corresponds to the age of a blob , which is propagating with mild - relativistic speed through the relativistic jet ( @xcite ) , and is approximately written by @xmath49 . for mrk 501",
    ", we obtain @xmath50 where @xmath51 pc is the distance from the core to the blob ( @xcite ) and @xmath52 is the average speed of the blob ( @xcite ) .",
    "this blob is currently operating for particle acceleration , and therefore @xmath26 can not be compared to the adiabatic loss timescale for agn , which corresponds to the lifetime of the shock ( @xcite ) .",
    "the timescale of adiabatic losses is expressed as @xmath53 , where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the lorentz factor of the jet and the speed of the radial expansion .",
    "considering narrow opening angles of blazars , which implies @xmath56 , we can safely say that @xmath26 is sufficiently shorter than @xmath57 .",
    "once accelerated particles acquire sufficient energies , they are escaping from the local magnetic fields , given as a function of the filament sizes .",
    "this spatial limit is given by the assumption that the gyroradius of each particle should not be beyond the transverse size of the local filament .",
    "then , the local maximum energy is denoted by @xmath58 .",
    "the transverse sizes of the minimum and maximum filaments are regarded as being comparable to the debye sheath and the jet diameter , respectively .",
    "thus , the energy of particles escaping from the largest filament can be written as @xmath59 where @xmath60 pc is the extent of the radio emitting region ( @xcite ) .",
    "this value is estimated by substituting @xmath61 g for @xmath62 in the formula suggested by marscher ( 1987 ) .",
    "once protons are accelerated and injected into the high - energy regime of @xmath63 , they are no longer bounded to the local magnetic field .",
    "field vectors are randomly oriented in the internal jet in the transverse direction to the filament , and hence these protons can move almost freely in the jet being deflected by the random magnetic field . allowing for shock propagation , protons are additionally accelerated in this regime , being off - resonantly scattered in a forest of magnetized filaments . in this aspect , the preliminary accelerator via the conventional dsa mechanism can be regarded as being an injector to this further booster .",
    "the new injection mechanism is referred to as transition injection , in analogy to bound - free transition in atomic excitation .",
    "the characteristic time of the additional acceleration for protons is given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 ( e.g. , @xcite ) and @xmath66 are the spectral index and energy of protons , respectively ; @xmath67 is the filamentary turbulent spectral index , and @xmath68 is assumed . the maximum energy boosted by the additional acceleration is also restricted by some radiative loss processes .",
    "in addition to two possible timescales : for diffuse synchrotron , @xmath69 , and for the p@xmath3 collision , @xmath70 , we consider the shock propagation timescale , @xmath26 , and therefore @xmath71 .",
    "the spatial limit will also be considered .      the additionally accelerated protons deflected by the random magnetic fields emit unpolarized synchrotron radiation . here",
    ", we adopt the characteristic cooling time for the diffuse synchrotron from our previous paper ( @xcite ) , which was derived from the theoretical basis by @xcite : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the timescale of normal synchrotron losses and @xmath74 $ ] . for @xmath8 ( @xcite ) , the maximum energy of a proton , @xmath32 ,",
    "is directly estimated by the equation @xmath75 , which gives @xmath76 it should be noted that the maximum energy restricted by the diffuse synchrotron is free from the magnetic field strength because of the same @xmath62-dependence of @xmath77 and @xmath69 .",
    "cooling due to collisions with photons is also characterized by the above - mentioned diffuse synchrotron : @xmath78 . using the same target photon spectrum and other notation with those given in @xmath79",
    ", we obtain @xmath80      as we have mentioned in  2.1.3 , the shock propagation time regarded as the age of the blob restricts the acceleration .",
    "equating @xmath81 , we obtain @xmath82      it should be noted that additionally accelerated particles are not gyrating to the local fields , but deflected by randomly oriented fields .",
    "thus , the spatial limit is determined by the condition that the mean free path for this collisionless deflection should be smaller than the system size : @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is a dimensionless parameter ( see , @xcite , for the details ) .",
    "it gives @xmath85 where @xmath86 is assumed .",
    "putting together the above discussion , provided both the normal and transition injection of protons are realized in a blazar jet , multi - stage diffusive shock acceleration can take place . in this subsection , we present the results of a numerical evaluation of the achievable maximum energies of protons in both stages within the conceivable parameter region . in fig.[fig :",
    "fig1 ] , the energies of accelerated protons are plotted against the transverse filament size parametrizing the ratio of the mean / fluctuate magnetic energy density , @xmath20 .",
    "the transverse filament sizes , @xmath4 , covers the range from @xmath87 pc to @xmath88 pc .",
    "the minimum and the maximum sizes are compared to the correlation length of alfvenic fluctuation and the jet diameter , respectively . as shown , in the case of preliminary acceleration the achievable maximum energies of protons",
    "are mainly restricted by the escape from individual filaments , which is represented by a linearly increasing line ( @xmath89 ) . in the case of @xmath90 ,",
    "the proton energies achieved via preliminary acceleration , @xmath91 , are determined by @xmath92 over the whole range of the considered filament sizes . in the case of @xmath93 , the values of @xmath91",
    "are also determined by @xmath92 for @xmath94 pc , while the @xmath91-values are more severely restricted by the propagation time of the shock for @xmath95 pc , and hence the achievable energy via the preliminary acceleration , @xmath91 , is cut - off at @xmath96 ev . if @xmath97 , the @xmath91-values are perfectly overlapped with those of @xmath90 .",
    "on the other hand , the maximum energy achieved by the additional acceleration @xmath98 is independent of not only the filament size , but also the @xmath20-parameter .",
    "the energies of accelerated protons can be additionally boosted up to the value determined by the spatial limit expressed with a horizontal line of @xmath99 ev , irrespective of their energies acquired by the preliminary acceleration .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)figure1.eps    we also present the @xmath4-dependence of @xmath91 parametrizing the @xmath100-value in fig.[fig : fig2 ] .",

    "for the cases of @xmath102 g and 0.1 g , the proton energies achieved by the preliminary acceleration , @xmath91 , are determined by @xmath92 over the whole range of conceivable filament sizes . in the cases of @xmath103 g and 10 g ,",
    "the protons dominantly lose their energies via collisions with photons for @xmath104 pc and for @xmath105 pc , respectively .",
    "thus , the resultant maximum value of @xmath91 is nearly @xmath106 ev . as for the additional acceleration ,",

    "the @xmath98-value for @xmath103 g is identical to that for @xmath109 g , and in these cases the energy is restricted by collisions with ambient photons .",
    "in the previous section we calculated the achievable maximum energies of protons in a blazar jet . since the proton energies accelerated by multi - stage dsa are sufficiently higher than the neutrino - producing threshold via photopionization , we can safely expect significant fluxes of energetic neutrinos .      in the photomeson process of @xmath110",

    "then , we can express @xmath134 with observable quantities in a compact notation , @xmath146 where @xmath147 is a constant taking the branching ratios of interaction chain and corresponding momentum transfer into account .",
    "the intrinsic proton luminosity , @xmath148 , can be replaced with the observed @xmath149 taking the proton interactions with ambient photons into consideration .",
    "however , @xmath149 is still unknown ; we assume it to be as 10 @xmath150 of the photon total luminosity ( @xcite ) .",
    "we also replace @xmath151 with @xmath152 , with considering the possible p and @xmath153 absorption in the vicinity of the source .    summarizing the above discussion , we adopt the following formula of differential flux from an individual blazar ( @xcite ) : @xmath154 where the factor 2 reflects the contribution of neutrinos and anti - neutrinos .",
    "since we are concerned with the point - source neutrino flux , we consider the @xmath155 contribution on account of their highest angular resolution .",
    "this is attributed to the large muon track , having advantege of reconstructing paths .    in fig.[fig",

    "one can see that for a steeper energy spectrum the neutrino flux is more significantly reduced in the energy range of @xmath163 gev . on the contrary , in the lower energy region of @xmath164",
    "gev the flux is higher in the case of a steeper spectrum because of the contribution from the denominator .",
    "anyhow , the neutrino flux originating from a single blazar is trivial compared to the observable level .",

    "the probability to detect @xmath155 in the tev - pev range is approximately given by @xmath165 where @xmath166 and @xmath167 are the muon range and the neutrino interaction length , respectively ( @xcite ) .",
