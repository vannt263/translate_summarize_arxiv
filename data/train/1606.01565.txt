    "<S> the mi regime for uhss with @xmath106 exhibits a violent instability ( see supplementary video 7 ) . </S>",
    "<S> notably , for a uniaxial ferromagnet with @xmath8 , mi is always operative . this is consistent with the focusing of spin waves and the formation of dissipative droplets in spin torque devices utilizing materials with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we now discuss an experimental test for the hydrodynamic predictions . </S>",
    "<S> as mentioned above , the dispersion relation eq .   features a spectral shift with non - zero fluid velocity . </S>",
    "<S> this shift can be observed e.g. , by means of brillouin light scattering ( bls ) , as already shown for dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions  @xcite . for a given fluid velocity </S>",
    "<S> , the magnitude of the shift , @xmath107 , can be tuned by an externally applied field . </S>",
    "<S> use of such tuning , in combination with bls , will allow a direct test of the predicted breaking of galilean invariance , insofar as the nonlinear properties of the dispersion relation eq .   can be quantitatively investigated . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , if one plots spin - wave frequency vs. wavenumber squared for both the stokes and anti - stokes bls peaks in the short - wavelength limit , @xmath108 , the modulus of the zero - wavenumber intercepts from linear regression _ will not be equal in the case of broken galilean invariance _ , in contrast to the case of galilean invariance , where the intercepts should be equal .    in summary , the dispersive hydrodynamic ( dh ) formulation permits us to quantify the manner in which thin film ferromagnets lack galilean invariance in the context of linear spin wave propagation on a dynamic uhs or static sdw background . </S>",
    "<S> the breaking of galilean invariance is often associated with relativistic phenomena wherein the lorentz transformation conjoins space - time into a single coordinate system , replacing the galilean transformation . instead , the present case ultimately reflects the counterintuitive ability of exchange - coupled , topological spin textures to support spin currents , even in the static case . </S>",
    "<S> the predictions are robust to damping , non - local dipolar fields , and finite temperatures for a large portion of phase space . the exact representation of the ll equation in dh form along with associated mathematical tools  @xcite enables new magnetodynamic predictions and a frontier of magnetic research , for example the observation of a mach cone , wavefronts , and vortex nucleation , suggesting the existence of coherent structures such as oblique solitons and dsws .    </S>",
