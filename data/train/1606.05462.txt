    "<S> the deviation may be attributed to the non - uniform spatial sensitivity of the 0.5 mm diameter detector used for the measurements as well as the acoustic scattering effects at the suture boundaries and other inhomogeneities of the skull . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the guided wave propagating parallel to the skull surface will reach the detector at different angles due to the skull curvature . </S>",
    "<S> the sutures are located at @xmath49 mm and @xmath50 mm . while the suture to the right is involved in the local maximum of the experimental decay curve , the amplitude of the wave propagating to the left approaches noise levels just before reaching the left suture . </S>",

    "<S> furthermore , close inspection of the imaginary part of the wavenumber @xmath52 reveals that the losses due to viscosity play a relatively minor role in the propagation of the skull - guided - waves within the studied frequency range ( see fig .  </S>",

    "<S> although our simplified model generally matches the experimental dispersion , limitations in the experimental spatio - temporal resolution along with additional effects induced by skull s curvature and inhomogeneities have made some of the measured modes difficult to discern . </S>",
    "<S> particularly challenging is the accurate distinction between the mode located close to the sound line and the bulk wave mode propagating at a grazing angle ( see fig .  </S>",

    "<S> in general , the guided wave has been observed here to propagate for distances beyond 3 mm across the mouse skull . </S>",
    "<S> although the experimental measurements are affected by scattering and artifacts due to the finite size of the detector and the skull curvature , the flat - plate model has been found to agree within an order of magnitude with the experimental results . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the theoretical model clearly points towards curvature and scattering as the main sources of attenuation for the skull - guided wave propagation .    from a practical stand - point , </S>",
    "<S> the reported skull - guided waves could be potentially used as sole or complementary carriers of acoustic information across the skull in imaging or therapeutic applications . due to similitudes of the cranial bone structure in small mammals and humans </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , it is generally expected that similar phenomena also exists in human skulls , although must be scaled accordingly in frequency and space . </S>",
    "<S> acoustic scattering and exponential decay along the depth direction ( @xmath53 ) may restrict the practical use of the guided - wave phenomenon to low frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> however , the achievable imaging resolution would not be compromised due to the shorter wavelength of the subsonic waves in comparison to bulk longitudinal waves in water for the same frequency ( see inset in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : attenuation](b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> although the dispersive nature of the skull - guided waves has to be further considered , the propagation problem is effectively 2.5-dimensional . </S>",
    "<S> naturally , penetration depth is limited by the evanescent decay in the @xmath53 direction , yet could be sufficient to target cortical brain structures per - cranially </S>",
    "<S> .    parameters of the immersion fluid are crucial in determining whether the particular mode remains guided or turns leaky . in this </S>",
    "<S> regard , our choice for water as a coupling medium is not random as its acoustic impedance is very close to most soft tissues @xcite including the brain , while water - based gels are further used as coupling medium in many biological applications . </S>",
    "<S> however , if the skull is surrounded on its either side by a different medium , e.g. air , the wave phenomena may dramatically differ .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we report for the first time , to the best of our knowledge , on the existence of guided acoustic waves in skull bone surrounded by water - like media . </S>",
    "<S> solid experimental evidence was further obtained on the dispersion of the skull - guided waves by means of near - field mapping of optoacoustically - generated broadband waves . </S>",
    "<S> reasonable agreement was found with the predictions of a multilayered flat plate model . </S>",
    "<S> characteristic decays in both the lateral and depth directions were characterized both experimentally and theoretically . </S>",
    "<S> due to the general scalability of our model and the experimental observations , the reported guided waves are also expected to exist in human skulls . </S>",
