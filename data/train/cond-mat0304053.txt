    "in a seminal series of papers @xcite baxter first introduced the concept of the so - called ` sticky hard sphere ' ( shs ) models , as the simplest - albeit crude - modelization for real fluids of spherical particles with a strong surface adhesion . in baxter s original formulation @xcite and its extension to the multi - component case @xcite ( both hereafter referred to as shs1 model )",
    "the pair potential contains - in addition to a hard sphere ( hs ) repulsion - a infinitely deep and narrow attractive square - well , obtained according to a particular limiting procedure ( baxter s ` sticky limit ' ) that keeps the second virial coefficient finite baxter68 .",
    "although this model appears rather pathological at first sight , it includes a number of interesting features which justify its wide popularity .",
    "first , the ornstein - zernike ( oz ) integral equation of the statistical - mechanical theory of fluids can be analytically solved for it within the _ percus - yevick _ ( py ) approximation and the solution exhibits a gas - liquid transition @xcite .",
    "second , baxter s model has already proven to be appropriate for describing some properties of colloidal suspensions , micelles , microemulsions and protein solutions with short - range interactions as well as some aspects of adsorption , flocculation and percolation phenomena , solvent - mediated forces , ionic mixtures , solutions with a small degree of size polydispersity and fluids of chain - like molecules ( for an illustrative , albeit not exhaustive , list of references , see @xcite ) .",
    "all this means that , in spite of its highly idealized character and known shortcomings stell91 , the shs1 model is able to capture some important physical features of structure , thermodynamics , and phase behaviour of many real systems .    however , the shs1 model has its main drawback in its problematic application to mixtures with a large number @xmath0 of components - as occurs for colloidal suspensions with large polydispersity - since this case requires the solution for a set of @xmath1 coupled quadratic equations @xcite , a task which can not be accomplished analytically .",
    "this important fact has originated a more recent attempt of finding an alternative shs model , which could be analytically tractable even in the general multi - component case brey87,mier89,ginoza96,tutschka98,tutschka00,tutschka01,tutschka02,gazzillo00,gazzillo02a , gazzillo02b , gazzillo03,timoneda89,ginoza01 .",

    "@xcite proposed to start from a hs - yukawa ( hsy ) potential    @xmath2    with @xmath3where @xmath4 is the distance between particles , @xmath5 ( @xmath6 being boltzmann s constant , and @xmath7 the temperature ) , @xmath8 denotes the hs diameter , @xmath9 the yukawa inverse range , @xmath10 an energy , and @xmath11 a reduced temperature ( as in shs1 , the factor @xmath12 simplifies subsequent analysis ) . the definition of this second hamiltonian ( shs2 model in the following ) is completed by the definition of a ` sticky limit ' , which in this case amounts to taking @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "it is worth remarking that , unlike its counterpart in the shs1 model , the starting potential @xmath14 is _  itself _ independent of temperature .    for the shs2 model ( in both cases of pure fluids and mixtures )",
    ", the oz equation can be solved analytically within the _ mean spherical approximation _ ( msa ) @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the shs2-msa solution @xmath15 ( or @xmath16 ) for the baxter form of the oz equation has exactly the same @xmath4-dependence as the shs1-py solution , i.e. both are expressed in terms of a second - degree polynomial in @xmath4 .",
    "however , the difference between the two solutions lies in the density and temperature dependence of their polynomial coefficients ( see below ) , which makes the shs2-msa solution readily usable even in the multi - component case tutschka98,tutschka00,tutschka02,gazzillo00,gazzillo02a , unlike the shs1-py one .    unfortunately , the common belief that the shs1 and shs2 hamiltonians are different but equivalent representations of a _",
    "unique _ shs potential jamnik96,jamnik01,tutschka98,tutschka00,tutschka01,tutschka02,jamnik91,hoye93 as well as a failure in appreciating the subtle distinction between _ model _ and _ solution _ @xcite have often generated a number of misunderstandings and erroneous beliefs in the literature on shs fluids .",
    "in particular , both aforesaid py and msa solutions have sometimes been regarded as corresponding to the same shs model ( baxter s one ) jamnik96,tutschka98,tutschka00,tutschka01,tutschka02,jamnik91 .",
    "on the contrary , in the present paper we stress that the shs1-py and shs2-msa _ solutions _ are different not only as stemming from _ different closures _ , but , more importantly , since they refer to _",
    "different hamiltonians_. in fact , unlike shs1 , the shs2 model _ itself _ is ill - defined from a thermodynamical point of view , and thus shs1 and shs2 can not be equivalent .",
    "we will prove this point by considering the _ exact _ second virial coefficient of the hsy potential ( [ i1 ] ) and showing that it _ diverges _ in the sticky limit ( a very short , preliminary , account of these results has been given in ref .",
    "as we further elaborate below , this pathology is hidden in the shs2-msa compressibility equation of state ( eos ) but is mirrored by a similar singular behaviour of the corresponding msa virial and energy eos s , never investigated in previous studies .",
    "the second and main goal of the present paper is to propose a new model ( shs3 ) which combines the advantages of both shs1 and shs2 . as shs1",
    ", it has a finite second virial coefficient , and thus it is a well - defined model .",
    "as shs2 however , it admits a simple analytical solution within a new closure , referred to as _ modified mean spherical approximation _ ( mmsa ) in the following .",
    "the remarkable property of the shs3-mmsa solution for @xmath15 is that it turns out to be formally identical with the shs2-msa one , and so are all quantities which are immediately derivable from it ( such as structural properties and compressibility eos ) . as a consequence of this mapping , all shs2-msa results obtained in the past for these quantities can be recovered after an appropriate re - interpretation .",
    "in addition , we will provide new results for other quantities , notably the virial and energy eos , for which the shs2-msa solution badly fails .",
    "this is _ not _ the case in the shs3-mmsa solution , where the energy eos turns out to be finite , albeit mean - field - like .",
    "finally , although the virial eos displays a singular behaviour within the shs3-mmsa as well , we will argue that , unlike the shs2 case , this divergence is a consequence of the deficiency of the mmsa closure , and _ not of the shs3 model itself_.    our findings thus provide a sound theoretical basis for a critical analysis of the existing literature on shs models , and allow to clarify misunderstandings and discard incorrect results , previously reported in the literature .    the plan of the remaining of the paper is the following . in section ii we will briefly recall the main features of the shs2-msa solution and describe the drawbacks of shs2 in detail . the new model along with the new closure , which constitute the central part of this work , are both discussed in section iii .",
    "final remarks and future perspectives close the paper ( section iv ) .",
    "for a one - component fluid of @xmath17 molecules in a volume @xmath18 with spherically symmetric interactions , the baxter form of the oz integral equation baxter71a is given by    @xmath19    where @xmath20 denotes the number density , @xmath21 the direct correlation function ( dcf ) , @xmath22 , with @xmath23 being the radial distribution function ( rdf ) .",
    "moreover , the prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath24 .",
    "solving the baxter equations is tantamount to determining the factor correlation function @xmath15 , an auxiliary quantity from which @xmath25 and @xmath26 can be easily derived .",

    "for the hsy potential the msa closure becomes    @xmath42    where the parameters are the same as in eq .",
    "( [ i1 ] ) .",
    "the analytic msa solution @xmath43 for the hsy fluid @xcite yields in the sticky limit ( @xmath44 ) the shs2-msa solution    @xmath45 \\theta \\left ( \\sigma -r\\right ) , \\qquad \\text { for \\ } r\\geq 0 ,   \\label{so1}\\ ] ]    @xmath46    @xmath47    where @xmath48 is the packing fraction .",
    "as remarked , the expression ( @xmath49 )  is formally identical with the shs1-py solution with the crucial difference that @xmath50 depends only on temperature ( being proportional to @xmath51 , whereas @xmath52 depends on _ both _ temperature _ and _ density ( in a more complex way ) @xcite .    once @xmath15 is known , all structural and thermodynamic properties can , in principle , be calculated .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , with a few exceptions  @xcite , the thermodynamic properties of shs2 are still mostly unexplored .",
    "however , we stress once again that the main aim of our paper is not to present new results on the shs2-msa thermodynamics ( although this task will be accomplished too ) , but to reveal a dramatic fault of the shs2 potential _ itself _ ( irrespectively of any approximate closure ) , which , surprisingly enough , has never been observed in the previous literature , but will emerge from the following simple analysis .",
    "the hamiltonian of the shs1 model was introduced by baxter as a limiting case , through a clever definition of _ both _ a starting potential and a limit procedure in such a way that the contribution of the vanishing square - well tail to the second virial coeffient , @xmath53 , remains finite and nonzero .",
    "it is instructive to consider the behaviour of @xmath53 for the shs2 model , by considering the result of the @xmath13 limit for the _ exact _ second virial coefficient @xmath54 of the hsy fluid .",
    "this can be calculated from the general definition , @xmath55with @xmath56 and @xmath57 $ ] being the boltzmann factor .",
    "one finds    @xmath58where @xmath59 -1\\right\\ } , \\]]it is now easy to show that @xmath60 diverges in the @xmath13 limit .",
    "to this aim we note that , for @xmath61 , one has @xmath62 and hence we can use the bound    @xmath63    as the right hand side of eq.([bound ] ) diverges as @xmath64 we have thus shown that @xmath65this result is exact and _ independent _ of any closure , and reflects an inconsistency of the hsy potential with the definition of sticky limit employed when setting up the shs2 hamiltonian @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the shs2 hamiltonian is ill - defined from the outset , and the corresponding model ( which can not be a different representation of baxter s one ) _ must be discarded_.    this is , however , a surprising result in some respect .",
    "one may rightfully wonder why no trace of the pathological nature of the shs2 model has ever been revealed by a number of structural studies tutschka98,tutschka00,tutschka02,gazzillo00,gazzillo02a carried out on its multi - component version . as discussed in section iv , all these structural results based upon the one and multi - component shs2-msa solutions are , in fact , fully correct after their re - interpretation in terms of shs3 . before doing this , however , it is instructive to consider those shs2-msa thermodynamic properties of the one - component fluid which have _ not _ been investigated so far .",

    "it is worth stressing again that this important feature has never been pointed out before , to our knowledge .    to convince the reader that our statement is correct , we now provide a simpler demonstration , based upon the analysis of the sticky limit of the msa second virial coefficients of the hsy fluid , as obtained from the density expansion of @xmath72  , @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "it is well known that , in any approximate theory , compressibility , virial and energy eos s may yield different virial coefficients , and the first one at which this difference begins to appear depends on the chosen closure .",

    "this singularity is mirrored by a similar behaviour appearing in both the virial and energy shs2-msa eos s , but it should be emphasized that it is a weakness of the model itself and is not due to the msa approximation .",
    "this means that the shs2 model itself is not properly defined and must be abandoned .    to replace it ,",
    "a proposal has been put forward in the second part of the paper .",
    "our recipe is based upon the introduction of a new potential ( m3 ) , coupled with a new closure ( mmsa ) , in such a way that the baxter - oz equations turn out to be analytically solvable , with formally the same solution @xmath15 found in the shs2-msa case .",
    "this remarkable correspondence allows a recovery of all previous results for structure factors and compressibility eos based upon the shs2-msa solution tutschka98,gazzillo00,gazzillo02a , gazzillo02b , after a re - interpretation in terms of shs3-mmsa .",
    "the shs3 model is the simplest correct alternative to shs2 .",
    "it is well - defined , since the sticky limit of the _ exact _ second virial coefficient , @xmath188 , remains _ finite . _ furthermore , its starting potential , m3 , is asymptotically equivalent to the hsy one at large @xmath4 values , being different from it only in the contact region .",
    "as regards the closure , the mmsa is correct in the zero - density limit , and has , consequently , a higher thermodynamic consistency than the msa . as a matter of fact , compressibility , virial and energy routes all",
    "generate the same , exact , @xmath53 . on the other hand",
    ", one can not expect from the mmsa to go further in  consistency , since this closure is still rather poor , taking into account only the zeroth - order term in the density expansion of the dcf outside the core .",
    "we have shown that discrepancies are already found at the level of third virial coefficient : @xmath189 is temperature - dependent but different from @xmath190 , @xmath191 diverges , while @xmath192 is temperature - independent and equal to its hs counterpart .",
    "clearly , these three results could coincide within a more refined ( density - dependent ) closure .",
    "it would be very interesting to investigate whether the shs3 model admits further analytic solutions , within more sophisticated approximations ( such as , in particular , the py approximation ) .",
    "we plan to do such analysis in future work , including also a more detailed comparison with baxter s original model .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that the extension of the shs3 model to mixtures can be easily carried out .",
    "we hope that the corresponding solution can provide a simple useful tool for further studies on structural and thermodynamic properties of polydisperse colloidal fluids .",
    "this work was partially supported by the italian infm ( istituto nazionale per la fisica della materia ) .",
    "useful discussions with lesser blum , gerhard kahl and yurii kalyuzhnyi are gratefully acknowledged .",

    "we have adopted the following terminological distinction .",
    "a shs _ model _ is univocally defined by the specification of its hamiltonian , which is characterized by _ two _ elements : the choice of a starting potential , and the definition of a ` sticky limit ' procedure . on the other hand , a particular _ solution _",
    "is identified by _ three _ elements : the two ingredients of the model , along with a ` closure ' for the oz equation .                    here",
