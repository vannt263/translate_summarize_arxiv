    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are binary star systems in which the secondary , usually a late - type main sequence star , fills its roche lobe and loses mass to the white dwarf primary @xcite .",
    "cvs are long - lived systems that are stable against mass transfer , so the mass transfer must be driven by gradual changes in the orbit , or in the secondary star , or both .",
    "it is commonly believed that the evolution of most cvs is driven by the slow loss of angular momentum from the orbit , most likely through magnetic braking of the co - rotating secondary star , at least at longer orbital periods @xmath0 where gravitational radiation is ineffective ( @xcite give a recent discussion ) .",
    "the loss of angular momentum constricts the roche critical lobe around the secondary and causes the system to transfer mass as it evolves toward shorter @xmath0 . in this scenario",
    ", @xmath0 serves as a proxy measurement for the system s evolutionary state .",
    "correct and complete orbital period measurements are fundamental to any accurate theory of cv evolution . given the usefulness of @xmath0 , it is fortunate that it can usually be measured accurately and precisely .",
    "this paper presents optical spectroscopy of the nine cvs listed in table [ tab : synthmags ] .",
    "we took these observations mostly for the purpose of finding orbital periods using radial velocities ( none of these systems are known to eclipse ) .",
    "the long cumulative exposures also allowed us to look for any unusual features .",
    "the _ catalog and atlas of cataclysmic variables archival edition _",
    "@xcite lists seven of the stars as dwarf novae , one as either a dwarf nova or a dq her star , and one simply as a cataclysmic , possibly a dwarf nova similar to u gem or ss cygni ( type ugss ) . except for cz aql ,",
    "for which we confirm a 4.8-hour candidate period suggested by @xcite , all of these objects lacked published orbital periods when we began working on them .",
    "subsequently @xcite found @xmath5 d for gz cancri ; we had communicated our advance findings to these authors so they could disambiguate their period determination .",
    "all our spectra were taken at the mdm observatory on kitt peak , arizona , using either the 1.3 m mcgraw - hill telescope or the 2.4 m hiltner telescope .",
    "the earliest observations we report here are from 1995 , and the latest were obtained 2007 january .",
    "table [ tab : obsjournal ] gives a journal of the observations .    at the 1.3 m we used the mark iii spectrograph and a site @xmath6 ccd detector .",
    "the spectral resolution is 5.0  , covering a range of either 4480 to 6760   with 2.2   pixel@xmath4 for the 2001 december bf eri data , or 4646 to 6970   with 2.3   pixel@xmath4 for the remaining data .",
    "the 2.4 m spectra , except for those of fo per , were obtained with the modular spectrograph and a site @xmath7 ccd detector , with 2.0   pixel@xmath4 , over a range of 4210 to 7500  and with a spectral resolution of 3.5  .",
    "the relatively small number of 2.4 m spectra of fo per were taken with a loral @xmath8-pixel detector , and cover from 4285 to 6870   at 1.25   pixel@xmath4 .",
    "for the most part we reduced the spectra using standard iraf procedures .",
    "the wavelength calibration was based on exposures of hg , ne , and xe lamps .",
    "prior to 2003 we took lamp exposures through the night and whenever the telescope was moved .",
    "for the 2.4 m data from 2003 to the present , we used lamp exposures taken in twilight to find the shape of the pixel - to - wavelength relation , and set the zero point individually for each nighttime exposure using the oi @xmath9 night - sky feature .",
    "the apparent velocity of the telluric oh emission bands at the far red end of the spectrum , found with a cross - correlation routine , provided a check ; although these are far from the feature used to set the zero point , their apparent velocity typically remain within 10 km s@xmath4 of zero . because of the increased efficiency of this technique , we attempted to use it at the 1.3 m telescope also , during the 2004 june / july observing run . for unknown reasons the results were unsatisfactory . to salvage the h@xmath10 emission velocities from that run",
    ", we determined a correction by cross - correlating the night - sky emission features in the 6200 - 6625   range with a well - calibrated night - sky spectrum obtained with a similar instrument .",
    "the correction was calculated for each individual spectrum and then applied to each measured velocity , and it did reduce the scatter somewhat , evidently because the wavelength range used includes the h@xmath10 emission line for which we measured velocities .    on all our runs , we observed flux standards during twilight when the sky was clear , and applied the resulting calibration to the data .",
    "the reproducibility of these observations suggests that our fluxes are typically accurate to @xmath11 per cent .",
    "we also took short exposures of bright o and b stars in twilight to map the telluric absorption features and divide them out approximately from our program object spectra . before flux calibration",
    ", we divided our program star spectra by a mean hot - star continuum , in order to remove the bulk of the response variation .",
    "table [ tab : synthmags ] lists @xmath12 magnitudes synthesized from our mean spectra , using the iraf _ sbands _ task and the passband tabulated by @xcite ; clouds , losses at the slit , and calibration errors make these uncertain by a few tenths of a magnitude , but they do give a rough indication of the brightness of each system at the time of our observation .      except for a few spectra taken in outburst ( which show weak emission or absorption on a strong continuum ) ,",

    "[ fig : specplot ] and  [ fig : bfsppl ] show averaged spectra , and table  [ tab : quie ] gives the equivalent width and fwhm of each line measured for each star from its averaged spectrum .",
    "two stars , bf eri and bi ori , showed the spectral features of a late - type star . to quantify the secondary contribution in these objects , we began by preparing averaged flux - calibrated spectra ( in bf eri s case the secondary s radial velocity curve was measurable , so we shifted the individual spectra to the secondary s rest frame before averaging ) . over time",
    "we have used the 2.4 m and modular spectrograph to collect spectra of k and m stars classified by @xcite or @xcite . the wavelength coverage and spectral resolution of these data",
    "are similar to the 1.3 m data .",
    "we applied a range of scaling factors to the library spectra , subtracted them from the averaged spectra , and examined the results by eye to estimate a range of spectral types and scaling factors giving acceptable cancellation of the late - type features .",
    "we use the spectral type and secondary flux to estimate the distance in the following manner .",
    "we begin by finding the surface brightness of the secondary star in @xmath12 , on the assumption that the surface brightness is similar to that of main - sequence stars of the same spectral type ; the barnes - evans relation for late - type stars is discussed by @xcite . combining the known @xmath0 with the assumption that the secondary fills its roche critical lobe",
    "yields the secondary s radius @xmath13 as a function of its mass , @xmath14 . in the relevant range of mass ratio , @xmath15 , approximately , and",
    "the dependence on @xmath16 is weak enough to ignore .",
    "we generally do not know @xmath14 , so we guess at a generous allowable range for this parameter using evolutionary simulations by @xcite as a guideline ; the weakness of the dependence of @xmath13 on @xmath14 means that this ( rather questionable ) step does not dominate the error budget . combining the surface brightness with @xmath13 yields the absolute magnitude @xmath17 .",
    "subtracting this from the apparent magnitude measured for the secondary star gives a distance modulus .",
    "the reddening maps of @xcite then can be used to estimate the extinction .",
    "note carefully that we do not assume that the secondary is a ` normal ' main - sequence star ; we assume only that the secondary s surface brightness is similar to field stars of the same spectral type .",
    "the normalization of the secondary s contribution also depends on the assumption that the spectral features used to judge the subtraction are similar in strength to those of a normal star .    as noted earlier , the immediate aim of our observations was to find orbital periods from radial velocity time series data .",
    "the h@xmath10 emission line is usually the strongest feature , and it generally gives good results in dwarf novae .",
    "all the emission - line velocities reported here are of h@xmath10 .",
    "we measured radial velocities of h@xmath10 emission using convolution methods described by @xcite and @xcite . in this technique one",
    "convolves an antisymmetric function with the line profile , and takes the zero of the convolution ( where the two sides of the line contribute equally ) as the line center . for the antisymmetric function with which the spectrum is convolved , we used either the derivative of a gaussian with adjustable width , or positive and negative gaussians of adjustable width offset from each other by an adjustable separation .",
    "uncertainties in the convolution velocities are estimated by propagating forward the counting - statistics errors in the individual data channels ; in practice , these are lower limits to the true uncertainties , since the line profile can vary in ways unrelated to the orbital modulation .",
    "the choice of convolution parameters is dictated by the shape and width of the line , and in practice the parameters are adjusted to give the best detection of the orbit .",
    "the physical interpretation of cv emission lines is complicated and controversial ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , but in almost all cases the emission - line periodicity accurately reflects @xmath0 ( though @xcite describe a noteworthy exception to this rule ) . a sample of the radial velocities for each object",
    "are listed in table  [ tab : vels ] , while the full tables can be found online .",
    "one of our systems , bf eri , has a k - type absorption component in its spectrum .",
    "we measured velocities of this using the cross - correlation radial velocity package described by @xcite , using the region from 5000 to 6500  , and excluding the region containing the he i @xmath185876 emission line and and the nad absorption complex . for a cross - correlation template spectrum",
    ", we used the a velocity - compensated sum of many observations of iau velocity standards taken with the same instrument , as described in @xcite .",
    "we searched for periods in all the velocity time series using the  residualgram \" method @xcite ; the resulting periodograms are given in figs .",

    "@xmath19 $ ] .",
    "[ fig : folpl ] shows the velocities folded on the best - fitting periods , and table [ tab : param ] gives the parameters of these fits .",
    "because of limitations of the sampling ( e.g. , the need to observe only at night from a single site ) , a single periodicity generally manifests as a number of alias frequencies . to assess the confidence with which we could assert that the strongest alias is the true period",
    ", we used a monte carlo test described by @xcite .",
    "the alias problem can be particularly irksome over longer timescales ; in this case the uncertain number of cycles elapsed between observing runs causes fine - scale `` ringing '' in the periodogram .",
    "the individual periods have tiny error bars , because of the large time span covered , but the ambiguity in period means that a realistic error bar  one that covers the range of possibilities  is much larger . in those cases ,",
    "the period uncertainties given in table  [ tab : param ] are estimated by analyzing data from the individual observing runs separately .",
    "when only two observing runs are available , the allowable fine - scale frequencies are well - described by a fitting formula @xmath20 here @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the epochs of blue - to - red velocity crossing observed on the two runs , and @xmath23 is the integer number of cycles that have passed between @xmath21 and @xmath22 . the allowed range of @xmath23 is determined from the weighted average of the periods derived from separate fits to the two runs data . when more than two observing runs are available , the situation becomes more complex . in some happy cases",
    "there are enough overlapping constraints that only a single , very precise period remains tenable .",
    "we were able to find such precise periods for lx and , lu cam , and bf eri .",
    "we discuss the stars in alphabetical order by constellation .      lx and was first identified as a variable star ( rr v-3 ) in the lick rr lyrae search @xcite .",
    "it was classified incorrectly as an rv tauri star , and its dwarf nova nature was unrecognized until the photometric study by @xcite .",
    "@xcite obtained spectra of lx and as part of their study of dwarf novae in outburst and determined the equivalent widths and fwhms of the balmer and he ii lines .",
    "our mean spectrum appears typical for a dwarf nova at minimum light .    because of the large hour - angle span",
    ", the radial velocity time series leaves no doubt about the daily cycle count , which is near 6.6 cycle d@xmath4 .",
    "the several observing runs constrain the fine - scale period in a more complicated way , but the monte carlo test indicates that a precise period of 0.1509743(5 ) d is preferred with about 98 per cent confidence .",
    "two other candidate periods separated from this by 1 cycle per 53.2 d in frequency are much less likely .      very little has been published on cz aql , which is listed in the _ archival edition _ as a u - gem dwarf nova .",
    "@xcite included the star in their spectroscopic study of irregular variables , and noted a probable 4.8 hour period and emission lines typical of dwarf novae .",
    "our velocities confirm the suggested 4.8-hour period , but we can not determine a unique cycle count between our observing runs .",
    "while the spectrum superficially resembles that of a dwarf nova , a closer look reveals interesting behavior . fig .",
    "[ fig : trail ] , constructed using methods described by @xcite , presents our spectra as a phase - averaged greyscale image .",
    "there is a striking broad component in the stronger balmer and hei lines that shows a large velocity excursion , with the red wing of h@xmath10 reaching to @xmath24 km s@xmath4 at phase 0.3 ( where phase 0 corresponds to the blue - to - red crossing of the line core ) .",
    "the broad components around h@xmath25 and @xmath26 move in phase with those of h@xmath10 and range from 900 to 2600 and @xmath27 to @xmath28 km s@xmath4 and 700 to 2100 and @xmath29 to @xmath30 km s@xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the wings of @xmath31 also move in phase with the others , but the red edge is difficult to follow at its minimum because of interference from the nad absorption lines , which are stationary and hence interstellar . the maximum of the red edge is 3200 km s@xmath4 , while the blue edge ranges from @xmath32 to @xmath30 km s@xmath4 .",
    "the blueward wing of all these lines is noticeably weaker than the redward wing .",

    "we also detect unidentified emission lines at @xmath37 , as is also seen in ls peg @xcite , and at @xmath38 .",
    "the strength of the @xmath39 diffuse interstellar band @xcite and the nad lines suggest that a good deal of interstellar material lies along the line of sight , and that the luminosity is relatively high .",
    "high - velocity wings reminiscent of the ones seen here have been seen in v795 her @xcite , ls peg @xcite , v533 her @xcite , and rx j1643 + 34 @xcite , all of which are sw sex stars .",
    "we do not , however , detect another sw sex characteristic , namely phase - dependent absorption in the hei lines @xcite .",

    "[ fig : pgrm1 ] clearly favors an orbital frequency near 15.7 cycles d@xmath4 , with a discriminatory power of 95 per cent and a correctness likelihood near unity .",

    "[ fig : bfsppl ] ) shows a significant contribution from a k star along with the usual dwarf - nova emission lines .",
    "normally , this suggests that @xmath46 h. nearly all our spectra yielded good cross - correlation radial velocity measurements as well as emission - line velocities .",
    "the absorption- and emission - line velocities independently give a period near 6.50 h ( table  [ tab : param ] ) , in accordance with expectation based on the spectrum .",
    "there is no ambiguity in cycle count over the 5-year span of the observations , so the period is precise to a few parts per million .",
    "[ fig : trail ] shows a phase - resolved average of the bf eri spectra , with the absorption spectrum shifting in antiphase to the emission lines .",
    "if the emission - line velocities faithfully trace the primary s center - of - mass motion , and the absorption - line velocities also trace the secondary s motion , then the two velocity curves should be exactly one - half cycle out of phase . in bf eri",
    ", we find a shift of @xmath47 cycles between the two curves , consistent with 0.5 cycles , so we feel emboldened to explore the system dynamics .",
    "masses can only be derived when the orbital inclination is known , as in eclipsing systems . to see if bf eri might eclipse , we derived differential magnitudes from images that were taken for astrometry ( discussed below ) and plotted them as a function of orbital phase .",
    "some images were taken at the phase at which an eclipse would appear , but no evidence for an eclipse was found .",
    "limits on the depth and duration of the eclipse are difficult to quantify because the data were taken in short bursts in the presence of strong intrinsic variability , so a weak eclipse can not be ruled out , but the photometry does suggest that the inclination is not close to edge - on .",
    "because the system apparently does not eclipse , we can not derive masses ; rather , we find broad constraints on the inclination by assuming astrophysically reasonable masses for the components .",
    "taken at face value , the velocity amplitudes @xmath48 imply a mass ratio @xmath49 .",
    "if we arbitrarily choose a white dwarf mass @xmath50 m@xmath51 ( so that @xmath52 m@xmath51 ) , the observed @xmath48 velocities imply @xmath53 degrees . to find a rough lower limit on the inclination",
    ", we consider a massive white dwarf ( @xmath54 m@xmath51 ) and , ignoring the constraint on @xmath55 for the moment , take @xmath56 m@xmath51 ; this yields @xmath57 degrees . for a rough upper limit",

    "it is surprising that bf eri has a very substantial proper motion .",
    "the lick proper motion survey @xcite gives @xmath76 = [ + 34 , -97]$ ] mas yr@xmath4 .",
    "we have begun a series of parallax observations with the hiltner 2.4 m telescope using the protocols described by @xcite ; so far we have five epochs from 2005 november and 2007 january .",

    "this is implausibly large , so we are left wondering how we might have overestimated the distance .",
    "one effect might be as follows .",
    "our distance is based on the secondary s apparent brightness , and we estimate the secondary s contribution to the total light by searching for the best cancellation of its features . if the secondary s absorption lines are weaker than those in the spectral - type standards , we would underestimate the secondary s contribution . in our best decomposition , the secondary is about 2.2 magnitudes fainter than the total light in @xmath12 . assuming ( unrealistically ) that _ all _ the light is from the secondary would therefore decrease the distance modulus by 2.2 magnitudes , to a distance of 340 pc .",
    "we do not yet have enough information to resolve the conundrum posed by bf eri s unmistakably large proper motion and its apparently large distance , but a reasonable compromise might be to put it at something like 400 - 500 pc , with an underluminous , low - metallicity secondary .",
    "the cross - correlation velocities of the secondary have a zero point determined to @xmath80 km s@xmath4 , more or less , and give a substantial systemic velocity of @xmath81 km s@xmath4 , or @xmath82 km s@xmath4 in the local standard of rest .",
