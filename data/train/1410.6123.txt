    "therefore , it provides a unique platform for studying a non - superconducting iron - pnictide system without fe local moments . from a different angle of view , this would facilitate the understanding of the electronic structure which is relevant to superconductivity and local moments in the superconducting iron pnictides .",
    "angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) is one of the most direct methods of studying the electronic structure of solids .",

    "early on , since the non - magnetic phosphide cafe@xmath2p@xmath2 is a close structural analog of cafe@xmath2as@xmath2 in the ct phase , its electronic structure is considered to somewhat reflect the electronic behavior of the ct phase @xcite .",
    "the de haas - van alphen study showed that the fermi surface of cafe@xmath2p@xmath2 is highly three - dimensional and the hole pocket only exists around the @xmath5 point of the brillouin zone , which are very different from the electronic strucure of an iron pnictide superconductor .",
    "recently , the ct phase was found to be stabilized under ambient pressure through introducing chemical pressure by specific dopants or thermal treatment @xcite .",

    "this contradiction indicates that the absence of magnetic ordering and superconductivity in the ct phase is not correlated with the presence or absence of hole pocket .",

    "illustrated by the detailed temperature dependence data , band reconstruction occurs abruptly across the transition , and the hysteresis of reconstruction in the temperature cycle further confirms its first order nature . by comparing the effective masses of the bands in these two phases , we propose that the suppression of electronic correlation , rather than the lack of fermi surface nesting , might be responsible for the absence of magnetic fluctuation and superconductivity in the ct phase @xcite .",

    "four bands ( @xmath28 , @xmath27 , @xmath26 and @xmath29 ) are found in the ct phase of ca@xmath0pr@xmath1fe@xmath2as@xmath2 , while only one electron - like band is found in the ct phase of ca(fe@xmath0rh@xmath1)@xmath2as@xmath2 and the annealed cafe@xmath2as@xmath2 .",
    "one possibility is that some of these bands might have a surface origin .",
    "however , the observed 1@xmath62 and 2@xmath61 surface reconstructions should contribute to the band folding at @xmath30 point rather than @xmath22 point @xcite , thus they are unlikely due to surface states .",
    "they are also unlikely caused by the weak magnetic ordering of praseodymium dopants at low temperatures @xcite , since it was shown before that the ordering of eu moment in eufe@xmath2as@xmath2 does not cause noticeable change to its low energy electronic structure @xcite .",
    "therefore , the unique band structure of ca@xmath0pr@xmath1fe@xmath2as@xmath2 is likely intrinsic , but further band structure calculations are needed to investigate how these additional bands are caused by the ct structural transition .",
    "our data show that almost all the bands tend to be more dispersive in the ct phase than in the ht phase of ca@xmath0pr@xmath1fe@xmath2as@xmath2 .",
    "we applied parabolic - curve fittings to evaluate the effective mass of each band in these two phases in approximately the same @xmath31 plane .",
    "the effective mass of @xmath46 in the ht phase slightly reduces from 1.73 @xmath58 0.02  @xmath59 to 1.6 @xmath58 0.1  @xmath59 ( @xmath54 ) in the ct phase .",
    "more evidently , the absolute values of the effective mass of @xmath17 and @xmath14 are 10.0 @xmath58 0.4  @xmath59 and 4.1 @xmath58 0.5  @xmath59 respectively . while in the ct phase",
    ", those values of @xmath23 and @xmath50 are 5.7 @xmath58 0.1  @xmath59 and 2.0 @xmath58 0.1  @xmath59 respectively .",
    "the reduction of effective mass indicates the suppression of electronic correlations in the ct phase , which is also the case in cafe@xmath2as@xmath2 @xcite . for iron - based superconductors ,",
    "it was proposed in the strong - coupling pairing scenario that the superconducting pairing is mediated by the local antiferromagnetic exchange interaction @xcite , which is linked to the reasonably strong electronic correlations or narrow bandwidth @xcite .",
    "since the fermi surface topology might be less relevant , it is most likely that the weakened correlations in the ct phase suppress the magnetic fluctuation , and subsequently push the system into the non - superconducting regime @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "we report detailed arpes results on ca@xmath0pr@xmath1fe@xmath2as@xmath2 ( @xmath3 = 0.1 and 0.15 ) single crystals . across the ct transition ,",
    "the sizable change in the crystal structure leads to the drastic electronic structure reconstruction .",
    "our results show discrepancies with the band calculations of cafe@xmath2as@xmath2 and significant mixing of different orbitals in the ct phase , which still call for further theoretical investigations . instead of the lack of fermi surface nesting between electron and hole fermi surfaces , we propose that the weakening of electronic correlations might be responsible for the absence of magnetic ordering and superconductivity in the ct phase .      some of the preliminary data ( not shown here ) were taken at ape beamline of elettra synchrotron light source .",
