    "over the past years , lep2 has been producing and studying @xmath0 bosons .",
    "one of the main goals of such a collider was the determination of @xmath5 with a target accuracy of 4050 mev . this has apparently been achieved . by combining their data in all possible @xmath0 decay channels , the four lep experiments quoted the following result : @xmath6 that compares rather favourably with the estimates obtained at @xmath7 colliders @xcite .",
    "this measurement is extremely important : if combined with an improved determination of the top mass , @xmath8 ( soon to be performed at the tevatron , during run 2 ) , it can lead to a rather stringent prediction of the higgs mass , from a fit to high precision electroweak ( ew ) data .",
    "one of the experimental strategies adopted to measure the @xmath0 mass at lep2 has been the kinematic reconstruction of the @xmath0 resonance through the momenta of its decay products is fitted to the shape of the @xmath9 total cross section for @xmath10 in the vicinity of @xmath11 ( the result quoted in eq .",
    "( [ mw ] ) does also include measurements obtained in this way ) .",
    "] , e.g. , in the fully hadronic channel : @xmath12 4  jets . a ` cleaner ' measurement",
    "is certainly performed in the semi - leptonic channel , i.e. , @xmath12 2 jets @xmath13 plus an undetected neutrino ( with @xmath14 ) .",
    "however , the contemporaneous presence in this case of missing energy in the final state and of photon radiation in the initial state ( isr ) , loosens the kinematic constraints that can be applied in the @xmath0 mass reconstruction procedure .",
    "besides , the fully hadronic decay rate has a somewhat higher statistics than the semi - leptonic one .",
    "therefore , although the event reconstruction is made harder in multi - jet final states by the larger number of tracks in the detector and by the usual uncertainties related to measuring jet energies and directions ( a task much less complicated in the case of leptons ) , the @xmath15 4  jets mode represented an accurate means of determining @xmath5 at lep2 @xcite .",
    "in fact , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the separate results obtained from the @xmath16 and @xmath17 channels are consistent , with a difference in mass which is very small : @xmath18 nonetheless , systematics errors on @xmath5 are somewhat larger in the @xmath19 than in the @xmath20 channels : see table 2 of ref .  @xcite .",
    "let us examine then more closely the kind of problems associated with the @xmath21 4  jets signature .",
    "one of the issues is the problem of estimating theoretical biases due to the relatively unknown ` colour - reconnection ' ( cr ) @xcite and ` bose - einstein correlation ' ( bec ) @xcite effects ( see @xcite for a theoretical review and @xcite for an experimental one ) .",
    "things go as follows . in @xmath22  jets",
    ", one should expect some interference effects between the two hadronic @xmath0 decays , simply because the decay products from the two different gauge bosons can overlap considerably in space - time .",
    "in fact , at lep2 energies , the separation between the two @xmath0 decay vertices is @xmath23 fm , that is , much smaller than the typical hadronisation scale , @xmath24 fm .",
    "hence , the two hadronic @xmath0 decays can no longer be considered as separate , since final - state interactions ( cr ) and/or identical - particle symmetrisation ( bec ) can play a non - negligible role , possibly leading to an apparent ` shift ' in the reconstructed @xmath0 mass resonance @xcite . unfortunately , because of our current lack of understanding of non - perturbative qcd @xcite  see also refs .",
    "@xcite  so are partonic ` fermi - dirac correlations ' ( as opposed to hadronic becs ) @xcite . ] , such interference effects can only be estimated theoretically in the context of different ` models ' .",
    "most of the latter can be constrained by looking at experimental observables which are sensitive to either phenomenon .",
    "for example , cr effects would be manifest in the central region , particularly in the single - particle distributions at low momenta , as produced in the fully hadronic versus the semi - leptonic channel , whereas becs would lead to an increase in the correlation function for @xmath1 , as compared to that for a single @xmath0 @xcite . while the jury is still out in the case of cr effects",
    ", there is an increasing evidence that bec effects are very small if at all present @xcite . in practice , the values that the lep experimental collaborations assign to the systematic errors on @xmath5 due to cr and bec effects range from 30 to 66 mev and from 20 to 67 mev , respectively ( 40 and 25 mev are adopted in the combined results ) @xcite .",
    "other problems in the fully hadronic decay channel of @xmath1 pairs are associated with the definition of ` jets ' .",
    "the problematic here is twofold .",
    "firstly , because two identical decays take place in the same event , one has the phenomenon of mis - pairing of jets .",
    "that is , even in the ideal case in which all tracks are correctly ascribed to the parton from which they originate , one has to cope with the ambiguity that it is in practice impossible to uniquely assign any pair among the four reconstructed jets to the parent @xmath0 on the sole basis of the event topology . of all possible combinations of di - jet systems ,",
    "only one is correct .",
    "thus , an ` intrinsic ' background exists in @xmath21 4  jets events , in terms of simple combinatorics .",
    "secondly , because of the large hadronic multiplicity , one also has the phenomenon of mis - assignment of tracks . in this case",
    ", the ambiguity stems from the fact that a track assigned to a jet , the latter eventually identified as a parton originating from one of the @xmath0 s , might have actually been produced in the fragmentation of another parton coming from the second @xmath25 decay .",
    "both these phenomenological aspects are clearly dependent upon the ` jet clustering algorithm ' ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) , wherein the number of hadronic tracks is reduced one at a time by combining the two most ( in some sense ) nearby ones ( hereafter , we will quantify the ` distance ' between two particles @xmath26 and @xmath27 by means of a variable denoted by @xmath28 ) .",
    "this ( binary ) joining procedure is stopped by means of a resolution parameter , @xmath29 , and the final ` clusters ' yielding @xmath28 values all above @xmath29 are called jets . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was precisely this dependence that was investigated , by using standard monte carlo ( mc ) simulation programs based on a parton shower ( ps ) approach ( see @xcite ) , such as herwig @xcite , jetset / pythia @xcite and ariadne @xcite .",
    "the results presented there did show a rather dramatic effect in the reconstructed @xmath5 values , due to the choice of the jet finder , and of its resolution parameter as well .",
    "however , any shift on @xmath5 of this sort can be estimated accurately , as it is simply due to kinematic effects induced by the jet clustering algorithm itself in reconstructing the quark momenta starting from the ps ( or after hadronisation ) . in practice",
    ", it can be treated as a well quantifiable correction to be applied to the reconstructed @xmath5 value , in order to reproduce the true one . using the same mc programs",
    ", one can also determine the typical size of the systematic errors due to the hadronisation process , by comparing the outputs of the various programs .",
    "finally , background effects can be accounted for by exploiting the numerous event generators available on the market for @xmath30 jets , both in ew @xcite and qcd @xcite@xcite , @xcite processes ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a dedicated study of the impact of such qcd background effects in @xmath31 4  jets ) .",
    "other systematic effects remain instead quite beyond control .",
    "these are intimately related to the way predictions are made within standard perturbation theory . that is , to the fact that only a finite number of terms of a perturbative series are generally computed over all the available phase space . or alternatively , that only over a restricted region of it , all terms of a series can be summed to all orders . whereas the availability of the latter is in general more crucial to the estimation of a total cross section , that of the former can be decisive for the study of more exclusive observables .",
    "given the relative size of the ew and qcd coupling ` constants ' at lep2 , it is clear that the dominant higher order effects will be due to the emission and/or absorption of gluons .",
    "several qcd effects entering @xmath31 4  jets events have been studied so far . for a start , it should be mentioned that the amplitude for @xmath32 ( the so - called cc03 channel ) is quite trivial to derive , in fact , more of a textbook example .",
    "it represents the lowest - order ( lo ) contribution to the @xmath12 @xmath33 signal .",
    "higher - order qcd contributions involving gluons are , for example , the real ones ( i.e. , tree - level processes ) : @xmath34 and @xmath35 events , which have been calculated in refs .  @xcite and @xcite , respectively , as well as @xmath36 , with the gluon splitting in a quark - antiquark pair , which was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "one - loop qcd corrections to @xmath32 are also known to date @xcite , and they have been interfered with the lo amplitudes and eventually combined with the single real gluon emission contribution of ref .",
    "@xcite into the complete @xmath37 result @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the full @xmath37 corrections were computed for the case of the so - called cc11 channel @xcite , also including irreducible background effects in addition to @xmath9 production and decay .",
    "finally , two - loop effects due to the virtual exchange of two gluons between the two quark pairs in hadronic @xmath1 decays were estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite in the ` soft limit ' and found to be either small ( colour - singlet exchange ) or large ( colour - octet exchange ) but symmetric around @xmath5 , hence unobservable in general .",
    "we make use here of the calculations of refs .",
    "@xcite in order to assess the size of the typical theoretical error due to the truncation of the perturbative series at order @xmath38 and the systematic effects that it introduces in observable quantities , primarily , in the ` line - shape ' of the @xmath0 resonance , as determined by using different jet finders to select the hadronic sample .",
    "our motivations to carry out such a study are dictated by the following considerations . for a start ,",
    "nlo corrections to both cc03 and cc11 have been found to be rather large in general @xcite , with their actual size clearly depending upon the algorithm used .",
    "furthermore , it is well known that differential distributions are typically more sensitive ( particularly in presence of cuts over the phase space available to gluon emission ) to higher order effects than fully inclusive quantities , such as total cross sections , where virtual and real contributions tend to cancel to a larger extent .",
    "besides , in the case of the @xmath0-mass line - shape , one would expect the distortion effects to be mainly induced by relatively hard and non - collinear gluons , which should be better modelled by an exact nlo calculation than by the ps models exploited in ref .  @xcite .",
    "all qcd predictions have an intrinsic dependence on an arbitrary scale , hereafter denoted by @xmath39 , entering at any order in @xmath38 .",
    "this scale is not fixed a priori . on the one hand , although the structure of the qcd perturbative expansion does not prescribe which value should be adopted for @xmath39 , an obvious requirement is that it should be of the order of the energy scale involved in the problem : i.e. , the cm energy @xmath10 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for detailed discussions ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the physical scales of gluon emissions that actually give rise to multi - jet configurations are to be found down to the energy scale @xmath40 . in practice",
    ", one should avoid building up large logarithmic terms related to the ( unphysical ) ` mismatch ' between the process scale @xmath41 and the emission scale @xmath40 and it is well known that it may be necessary to adopt a different scale for each observable in order to best describe experimental data taken at fixed @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "it is precisely the @xmath39-dependence of the truncated perturbative series that is treated very differently by each jet - clustering algorithm @xcite and the corresponding effects on observable quantities are what we aim to study . in our calculation , qcd effects appear through @xmath37 only , so that the @xmath39-dependence is merely the one affecting the strong coupling constant at lowest order . whereas its impact is trivial to assess ( and account for ) in the case of total inclusive rates , this is no longer true for differential quantities ( such as mass distributions ) , because of the different kinematics of lowest and higher order contributions , respectively .",
    "notice , however , that a problem arises when studying the scale dependence of @xmath38 results for algorithms based on different measures , as for the same @xmath42 the total cross section at nlo can be significantly different .",
    "a more consistent procedure was outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite : that is , to compare the nlo scale dependence of the various schemes not at the same @xmath42 value , rather at the same lo rate .",
    "this is our approach .    in order to make more",
    "manifest the effects of the interplay between the @xmath43 corrections to @xmath44  partons events and the jet clustering schemes tested , we have not considered here coulomb corrections to cc03 @xcite ( their relevance is anyway modest beyond the @xmath1 threshold ) .",
    "we also have neglected the implementation of the mentioned bec and cr phenomena , as these mainly arise in the non - perturbative domain .",
    "similarly , hadronisation and detector effects were not investigated , nor those due to isr .",
    "we refer the reader to refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , respectively , where their impact was studied in detail .    as centre - of - mass ( cm ) energy representative of lep2",
    "we have used the value @xmath45 gev . as for the parameters of the theory , we have adopted ( in the fixed - width approach ) @xmath46 gev , @xmath47 gev , @xmath48 gev , @xmath49 gev , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and the one - loop expression for @xmath52 ( for consistency ) , with @xmath53 gev ( yielding @xmath54 ) adopted here are consistent with the two - loop one extracted from experimental fits to shape variables at the @xmath55 peak , @xmath56 , for the same choice of @xmath57 . ] .",
    "furthermore , we have kept all quarks massless as a default , in order to speed up the numerical evaluations .",
    "electron and positron have mass zero too , so has the neutrino .",
    "also , we have neglected cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) mixing terms ( i.e. , we have taken the ckm rotation matrix to be diagonal ) .       as jet clustering schemes ( other choices have negligible impact on our conclusions ) . ] , we have used a selection of the binary ones , in which only two objects are clustered together at any step .",
    "these are the following .",
    "the jade ( j ) one @xcite , which uses as a measure of separation ( or ` metric ' ) the quantity @xmath58 the durham ( d ) @xcite and the cambridge ( c ) @xcite ones , both using @xmath59 ( the cambridge algorithm in fact only modifies the clustering procedure of the durham jet finder . )",
    "we also have adopted the luclus or lund ( l ) jet finder @xcite , for which one has @xmath60 however , with the same clustering procedure of the cambridge scheme and without ` preclustering ' and ` reassignment ' ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , i.e. , as done in ref .  @xcite ( where it was labelled as cl ) . in eqs .",
    "( [ j])([l ] ) , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the energies(moduli of the tree - momenta ) and @xmath63 the angular separation of any pair @xmath64 of particles in the final state , to be compared against the resolution parameter @xmath42 .",
    "the choice of these particular schemes has a simple motivation .",
    "the d , c and l ones are different versions of ` transverse - momentum ' based algorithms , whereas the j one uses an ` invariant - mass ' measure ( the numerator of eq .",
    "( [ j ] ) coincides with the invariant mass of the partons @xmath64 , when the latter are massless , as is the case here ) .",
    "in fact , these two categories are those that have so far been employed most in phenomenological studies of jet physics in electron - positron collisions , with the former gradually overshadowing the latter , thanks to their reduced scale dependence in higher order qcd , e.g. , in the case of the @xmath65 three- @xcite and @xmath66 four - jet rates @xcite , and to smaller hadronisation effects in the same contexts @xcite .",
    "our multi - jet sample is selected at the parton level , by requiring a final state with _ at least _ four resolved objects ( i.e. , with all their @xmath28 s above a given @xmath42 ) .",
    "when five objects survive , the two yielding the smallest @xmath28 value ( according to the metric used ) are joined together , so to always produce a four - particle final state . in doing so , we conform to typical experimental approaches : see , e.g. , ref .",

    "[ tab : cc03_fit ] reproduces the results of one of our fits . whereas the values of some of the parameters ( such as the height @xmath122 and the width @xmath123 of the distributions ) depend sensibly on the choice of the mass interval used for the fit and/or the form of the background , the values extracted for @xmath5 at nlo are remarkably more stable and @xmath124 which characterise the background . ] .",
    "the parameters in the table should be taken as representative of the qualitative features of all fits that we performed .",
    "from there , one notices a strong dependence of the fitted @xmath5 value upon the jet scheme ( for a ` fixed ' @xmath39 ) , with variations of up to almost 380 mev ( between the j and l schemes , when @xmath125 gev and assuming a polynomial background ) .",
    "however , all effects discussed above are well understood , since they are merely of kinematical origin ( the different handling of gluon radiation by the various jet clustering algorithms ) . as already stressed repeatedly ,",
    "it is the systematics associated with the choice of @xmath39 that is beyond theoretical control .",
    "it turns out that such an intrinsic uncertainty of the fixed - order qcd predictions can be rather large in the determination of the @xmath0 mass : compare the values for @xmath5 as obtained in the nlo fits and given on the left of tab .",
    "[ tab : cc03_fit ] to those on the right .",
    "the differences between the reconstructed @xmath5 values for @xmath125 and 175 gev ( which , hereafter , we denote by @xmath126 ) can become as large as 130 mev ( for the l scheme , in presence of a polynomial background ) .",
    "the j scheme seems to be here the least sensitive to @xmath39-variations ( a 10 to 20 mev effect ) , with the d and c ones falling in between . notice that , in this exercise , we have restrained ourselves to values of @xmath39 not smaller than @xmath127 , precisely in order to avoid the mentioned logarithmic effects induced by a choice of @xmath39 too close to the jet - scheme - dependent emission scale @xmath128 ( see also footnote 7 ) .",
    "indeed , for @xmath39 in the above interval , we have found that to change the values of @xmath84 ( still maintaining the typical four - jet separations used in experimental analyses ) does not affect our conclusions .",
    "in fact , the latter do not change either , if one adopts a different recombination procedure of the cluster momenta .",
    "in summary , we have verified that theoretical errors arising from the use of different jet clustering algorithms in treating the fixed - order @xmath129 corrections from perturbative qcd , in the prediction of experimental observables used for the extraction of the @xmath0 boson mass in the hadronic channel @xmath130 jets ( cc03 ) at lep2 , can be competitive with similar systematic effects that could be induced by non - perturbative dynamics , such as cr and becs , e.g. , as predicted in the hadronisation model of ref .",
    "in particular , using various jet definitions , and spanning the scale of @xmath38 between @xmath5 and @xmath131 approximately , we have shown that these uncertainties on @xmath5 can be of order 100 mev , hence larger than current experimental assumptions on the size of the theoretical error .",
    "we also have verified that the inclusion of irreducible background via cc11 diagrams has little impact on our main conclusions , so has the incorporation of isr effects .",
    "similarly , a different treatment of the widths in the resonant propagators ( the fixed - width scheme was adopted here ) has negligible consequences for both cc03 and cc11 . a different choice of @xmath10 ( at fixed @xmath84 s , or vice versa ) yields similar estimates of @xmath126 to those given here .",
    "also , if one enforces typical @xmath0 mass reconstruction cuts , say , @xmath132 , for @xmath133 and @xmath134 gev @xmath135 30 gev , see eqs .",
    "( [ minimise])([average ] ) , typical values of @xmath126 remain in the above range , despite the effects on the actual event rates can be dramatic @xcite . finally , effects due to the kinematic interplay between jet clustering algorithms and ps ( including hadronisation ) were not in the original intentions of this study , as they have already been addressed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "whereas the latter can be estimated in the context of an event level mc analysis , those considered here are intrinsic uncertainties of the theory .",
    "the results of our present analysis point to the fact that such perturbative qcd effects may not yet be under control , at least in the context of @xmath0 mass determinations from the hadronic data samples collected at lep2 . taking also into account the results of ref .",
    "@xcite in the same context , wherein the systematic uncertainties in the reconstructed @xmath5 value due to the dynamics involved beyond the hard scattering processes ( as obtained in herwig and pythia ) were often found to be somewhat smaller than 100 mev ( more in line then with the experimental estimates discussed in the introduction ) , one may conclude that a thorough reassessment of the theoretical systematics entering the @xmath31  hadrons channel is in order , given the importance that the precise knowledge of the @xmath0 mass has in constraining the properties of yet undiscovered particles , such as the higgs boson mass .",
    "this will require the availability of a mc event generator based on the nlo matrix elements ( both real and virtual ) used in this analysis ( properly interfaced to the subsequent ps and hadronisation stages ) , which is under construction in the herwig environment @xcite .",
    "it will eventually be the implementation of the more sophisticated selection methods used by the lep collaborations ( as opposed to the simpler ones illustrated here ) in the context of a such a nlo - mc event generator that will finally assess the uncertainty range on @xmath5 still allowed by the most up - to - date theoretical and experimental instruments .",
