    "the cygnus loop  is considered to be a proto - typical evolved supernova remnant ( snr ) .",
    "located at a distance of 540 pc ( blair & sankrit 2005 ) , the remnant can be studied with high spatial resolution .",
    "its surface brightness is also high , which enables us to attain high signal - to - noise ratio observations .",
    "the cygnus loop  is therefore a great laboratory to study the evolution of a snr at different scales .",
    "the x - ray emission of the cygnus loop  is limb - brightened and clumpy , which is thought to be the result of a recent interaction with an inhomogeneous cavity wall ( levenson et al .",
    "1997 , levenson et al .",
    "several x - ray bright features in the edge of the remnant were studied , in the framework of the scenario of shock - cloud interaction ( miyata & tsunemi 2001 , levenson et al .",
    "2002 , levenson & graham 2005 , and patnaude et al.2002 ) .",
    "however , the issue of the origin of the hot plasma contributing to the x - ray  emission in these regions was not addressed in detail yet .",
    "one of the difficulty is to take into proper account typical non - linear physical processes occurring in these systems , such as radiative losses and thermal conduction .",
    "to better understand the origin of the x - ray  emission , a detailed model that could be accurately compared with the observation is required .",
    "miceli et al .  ( 2006 ) studied an isolated x - ray  knot in the vela snr ( vela fi1d ) by directly comparing models with observations .",
    "they built up a set of hydrodynamic simulations of shock - cloud interaction including thermal conduction and radiative cooling effects .",
    "the model setups were determined taking account of the earlier analysis of the x - ray data ( miceli et al .",
    "they synthesized the x - ray emission ( maps and spectra ) from the models , and compared it directly with the observation for the first time . in this way , a self consistent picture of the hot x - ray emitting plasma was derived , and the importance of thermal conduction was confirmed in this case .",
    "orlando et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and orlando et al .",
    "( 2006 ) examined the shock - cloud interaction in different physical regimes by using a detailed hydrodynamic model , including thermal conduction and radiative losses , and synthesizing the relevant x - ray  emission .",
    "based on these works , orlando et al .",
    "( 2010 ) proposed a diagnostic tool to derive quickly the efficiency of thermal conduction from the results of the x - ray  data analysis , without the need of running a time consuming ad - hoc hydrodynamical model . by using such advanced method ,",
    "the origin of x - rays in the cygnus loop  can be investigated to derive a better understanding of the shock - cloud interaction . in this paper",
    "we apply this method to a still not well understood region of the cygnus loop , an outstanding interaction region named  xa \" by hester & cox 1986 . both bright x - ray  emission and bright optical emission are present in this region .",
    "the scenario of the blast wave interacting with a protrusion from the cavity wall was proposed to explain the properties of optical emission ( danforth et al .",
    "2001 , hester & cox 1986 ) .",
    "the proposed scenario is entirely different from the case of interaction with an isolated cloud in the vela snr studied by miceli et al .",
    "( 2005 , 2006 ) : therefore , it is necessary to see whether thermal conduction also plays an important role in this situation .",
    "we analyzed the _",
    "xmm_-_newton _  european photon imaging camera ( epic ) observations of the xa region to examine the physical processes that account for the observed x - ray  emission .",
    "the observations and results are described in  2 and  3 . in  4 , we discuss the interpretation and derive the characteristic parameters of shock - cloud interaction .",
    "the conclusions are summarized in  5 .",
    ".observational parameters[tb : obs ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the extension of the line of sight ( l ) through the nearly spherical remnant ( with a radius of @xmath2 ) at the location of each region could be approximated as the length of the chord there .",
    "then the electron density of the @xmath3-@xmath4 component can be derived considering @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the filling factor . under the assumption of pressure equilibrium between the two components ,",
    "the filling factor can be estimated as @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( see bocchino et al .  1999 ) . from the ionization time scale and the density of the hot component",
    ", we also derived the time elapsed after the interaction with the shock , @xmath9 .",
    "the results of filling factors , densities , and @xmath9 ( with corresponding uncertainties ) are listed in table  [ tbl : dt ] .",
    "since the filling factors of the low temperature component are predominant in all the regions , the dense cloud material always fills most of the volume .",
    "the filling factors and the densities of the cold components are always higher in the knot regions than in the corresponding diffuse regions , and this confirms the inhomogeneities of the ism and indicates that the knot regions mostly subtend the shocked cloud material .",
    "the @xmath9 is longer in the diffuse regions than in the corresponding knot regions , and this is consistent with the direction of propagation of the blast wave , though uncertainties are large . in regions 5 , 7 , and 8 , the hot component seems close to ionization equilibrium , and @xmath9 would be maybe too long considering the cygnus loop   age .",
    "the discrepancy may be caused by mistaking the extension along the los .",
    "as an example , in region 8 , if we assume the extension along the los to be equal to the size of the region in the plane of the sky , we obtain more reasonable values ( @xmath10 yr ) , while the densities become larger ( n@xmath11=27 , n@xmath12=10.7@xmath13 ) .",
    "so the shocked cloud in regions 7 and 8 is probably a small , compact isolated knot which is much denser than the others .",
    "the case could be similar in region 5 .    as explained in sect .",
    "[ spectral analysis ] , the low temperature component can be associated with the shocked ism , because of its characteristic low abundances .",
    "the densities of the x - ray  emitting shocked clouds ( i.  e. @xmath14 in table  [ tbl : dt ] ) are comparable with that obtained in other cloud - shock interaction regions in the cygnus loop ; for example , in the northeastern limb @xmath151.64 @xmath16 ( miyata et al .",
    "2007 , the densities of the high temperature component are 12 @xmath16 there ) , in the southwestern region @xmath150.51 @xmath16 ( patnaude et al .",
    "2002 ) , and in the western limb the pre - shock cloud density is 5 @xmath16 ( levenson et al .",
    "2002 ) . the densities of fild , a shocked cloud in the vela snr , were found to be 0.325 @xmath16 for the cloud core and 0.145 @xmath16 for the corona ( miceli et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "the overabundances revealed in the hot components in region 4 and region 9 are consistent with an ejecta origin , and their temperatures are higher than that of the shocked ism derived in the other regions .",
    "both region 4 and region 9 are bright in the hard band emission . in region 4 , a bright knot is visible in the hard band map ( fig .",
    "[ f:3bandsmpe]c ) , and this may indicate a fragment or protrusion in the ejecta . in region 9 , the temperature of the cooler component is higher than that in the other regions , and this is consistent with its lower density .",
    "the region is located inside the remnant , where the ejecta is likely to be prominent ( @xmath17  0.85  r@xmath18 , tsunemi et al .",
    "2007 , katsuda et al .",
    "indeed , in the large x - ray  bright region to the northwest of our fov ( containing region 9 ) there is also the contribution of some edge - on sheet of shocked ism ( raymond et al .",
    "1988 , blair et al .  1991 ) , so the x - ray  emission in this region is probably associated both with the hot ejecta and the shocked ism .    the long strip (  finger \" ) that we detected in the soft band ( fig .",
    "[ f:3bandsmpe]a ) and in the median photon energy maps ( fig .",
    "[ f:3bandsmpe]b ) is likely an extension of the very dense small protrusion observed in the optical band by danforth et al .",
    "the densities of the cold component in regions 5&6 ( corresponding to this finger ) are high , and this may also be related to the enhancement of 25 @xmath19 m mid - infrared emission ( fig .",
    "[ f : softvsir ] ) .",
    "however , no optical emission from the finger has been detected , thus suggesting that it does not correspond to the densest core of the xa region .",
    "the presence of the finger indicates that the protrusion in the cavity wall is much larger than what was thought before .      to examine the role of thermal conduction in the shock - cloud interaction , we applied the method proposed by orlando et al .",
    "( 2010 ) . by adopting this method",
    ", we can perform a direct and quick comparison between the observations and the results of the numerical model of shock - cloud interaction , without the need to run ad - hoc ( and time - consuming ) mhd simulations . in particular , we adopt a robust criterion that consists in comparing the temperature and the emission measure per unit area of the cold component derived from the knot ( t@xmath20[knot ] , em@xmath20[knot ] ) to that derived from the corresponding diffuse regions ( t@xmath20[diffuse ] , em@xmath20[diffuse ] ) .",
    "our results are shown in fig .",
    "[ f : tvsem ] .",
    "orlando et al .",
    "( 2010 ) showed that when thermal conduction is at work , we expect t@xmath20[diffuse]/t@xmath20[knot]@xmath21 and em@xmath20[diffuse]/em@xmath20[knot]@xmath22 .",
    "as shown in fig .  [ f : tvsem ] , we found that thermal conduction is efficient in all the shock - cloud interaction regions .",
    "because of the presence of ejecta in regions 3&4 , we can not draw a conclusion there . in regions 5 and 6 ,",
    "that are at a relatively large distance from the border of the shell , we expect the emission to be contaminated by the contribution of multiple components along the los",
    ". this may be the reason of the high value em@xmath20[diffuse]@xmath23em@xmath20[knot ] for these two regions .",
    "however , considering the error bars , all regions are consistent with a scenario where the contribution of thermal conduction is relevant .",
    "orlando et al .",
    "( 2010 ) also showed that the slope of the @xmath24 vs @xmath25 plot can provide important information on the efficiency of thermal conduction and on the physical properties of the shock and the cloud .",
    "we presented these plots for our spectral regions in fig .",
    "[ f : rvse ] .",
    "we found that the steepest descending trend of the ( @xmath24 ) vs @xmath25 plots ( in regions 7&8 ) is about two times flatter than that predicted by the theoretical model without thermal conduction ( as shown in fig .",
    "@xmath26 in orlando et al .",
    "such flat descending trends are instead consistent with the shock - cloud interaction with prominent thermal conduction . as shown in orlando et al .",
    "2010 , the @xmath24 vs @xmath25 slope is sensitive to the shock mach number , and the flatter trends in regions 1&2 and 5&6 probably indicate higher mach numbers . in regions 7&8 ,",
    "the steeper descending trend and the cold plateau provide convincing evidences for less efficient thermal conduction .",
    "this could be caused by slow shocks , presence of magnetic fields , or both . considering that the magnetic field scale - length should be much larger than the distance between our regions",
    ", we do not expect large variations of the magnetic field and we conclude that a slow shock in regions 7&8 may be more reasonably account for the steeper trend of the @xmath24 vs @xmath25 plot .",
    "the ascending trend in regions 3&4 is not predicted in the theoretical models of shock - cloud interaction by orlando et al .",
    "the ejecta origin of the x - ray emission in region 4 could be the reason of such ascending trend , but further investigation is needed to confirm this .",
    "the _ xmm_-_newton _  observations toward the xa region in the cygnus loop  reveal several clumps interacting with the primary blast wave .",
    "like other shock - cloud interaction regions , the spectra can be modeled with two thermal components , associated with the shocked cloud material and the cloud corona , respectively .",
    "we applied the diagnostic method proposed by orlando et al .",
    "( 2010 ) to investigate the physical process involved in the shock - cloud interaction .",
    "the primary results are :    * the ism around the xa region is dense and clumpy and the shocked cloud material occupies @xmath27 of the volume behind the snr shock front ; the derived post - shock densities are in the range 311 @xmath16 for the low temperature component ( associated with the cloud core ) and 0.93.0 @xmath16 for the high temperature component ( associated with the cloud corona ) . * the joint abundances of c , n , and o in the ism are found to be lower than solar ( @xmath0 times the solar value ) , as in other parts of the cygnus loop ; * a long  finger \" ( @xmath28 pc ) protruding from the cavity wall is detected ; * thermal conduction is prominent in all the regions , and affects both the spatial distribution of the x - ray  emission and its spectral properties ; * we detected the presence of ejecta and of a small ejecta shrapnel / protrusion .",
