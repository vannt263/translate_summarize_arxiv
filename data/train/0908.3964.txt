    "one of the major achievements of statistical physics is the fundamental explanation of critical behaviour at continuous phase transitions through wilson s renormalization group ( rg ) approach .",
    "while this has mostly provided a satisfying picture for over thirty years , certain types of phase transitions have resisted full treatment .",
    "such stubborn cases , which have been the subject of conflicting proposals and analyses , include systems with in - built disorder .",
    "the ising model with uncorrelated , quenched random - site or random - bond disorder is a classic example of such systems and has been controversial in both two and four dimensions .",
    "in these dimensions , the leading exponent @xmath0 which characterises the specific - heat critical behaviour vanishes and no harris prediction for the consequences of quenched disorder can be made  @xcite . the harris criterion indicates if the specific heat of the pure system diverges ",
    "i.e. , if @xmath1 there  then the critical exponents may change as random quenched disorder is added to a system .",
    "if @xmath2 in the pure system , then this type of disorder does not alter critical behaviour and the critical exponents are unchanged in the random system .",
    "in the two - dimensional case , the controversy concerns the strong universality hypothesis which maintains that the leading critical exponents remain the same as in the pure case and the weak universality hypothesis , which favours dilution - dependent leading critical exponents ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .    since @xmath3 marks the upper critical dimensionality of the model",
    ", the leading critical exponents there must be given by mean field theory and there is no weak universality hypothesis .",
    "however , unusual corrections to scaling characterise this model , and the precise nature of these corrections has been debated .",
    "this debate motivates the work presented herein : methods similar to those employed in  @xcite , namely a high - statistics monte carlo approach coupled with finite - size scaling ( fss ) , are used to progress our understanding of the four - dimensional version of the random - site ising model ( rsim ) .    while not directly experimentally accessable , the four - dimensional rsim is of interest for the following reasons : ( i ) it is closely related to the experimentally important dipolar ising systems in three dimensions , ( ii ) it is an important testing ground for the widespread applicability of the rg , ( iii ) it presents unusual corrections to scaling , ( iv ) in high energy physics , the establishment of a non - trivial higgs sector  @xcite for the standard model requires a non - gaussian fixed point and a new universality class which may , in principle , result from site dilution and ( v ) it is the subject of at least _ five _ analytical papers which differ in the detail of the scaling behaviour at the phase transition .    in section  [ s2 ] ,",
    "the current status of the rsim in four dimensions is reviewed , paying particular attention to previous detailed analytical predictions in the literature for its scaling behaviour .",
    "the scaling relations recently presented in  @xcite are then used to construct full scaling descriptions based on earlier partial theories  @xcite . in section  [ s3 ] the theoretical finite - size scaling behaviour of the model",
    "is presented .",
    "the details of the extensive numerical simulations are given in section  [ s4 ] , the outcomes of which are analysed in section  [ s5 ] .",
    "our conclusions are summarised in section  [ send ] .",
    "the consensus in the literature is that the following structure characterises the scaling behaviour of the specific heat , the susceptibility and the correlation length at the second - order phase transition in the rsim in four dimensions ( up to higher - order correction to scaling terms ) @xcite : @xmath4 here , the subscript indicates the size of the system , the reduced temperature @xmath5 marks the distance of the temperature @xmath6 from its critical value @xmath7 and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are constants .",
    "the correlation function at criticality decays as  @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 measures distance across the lattice , the dimensionality of which is @xmath12 .",
    "the correlation length for a system of finite linear extent @xmath13 also exhibits a logarithmic correction and is of the form @xmath14 the leading power - law behaviour is believed to be mean field because the fixed point is expected to be gaussian and @xmath15 here , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are , in standard notation , the critical exponents for the magnetization out of field and in field , respectively while @xmath18 is the gap exponent characterising the yang - lee edge .",
    "there is no dispute in the literature regarding these leading exponents , some of which will be re - verified in this work . nor is there any dispute regarding the details of the unusual exponential correction terms in ( [ c1])([xiinfty ] ) .",
    "however there are at least _ five _ different sets of predictions for the exponents of the logarithmic terms , which differ from their counterparts in the pure model , and a principle aim of this work is to investigate these predictions numerically .",
    "aharony used a two - loop renormalization - group analysis to derive the unusual exponential terms in ( [ c1])([xiinfty ] ) , and also found  @xcite @xmath19 in  @xcite , shalaev pointed out that aharony s results needed to be refined and , by determining the beta function to three loops , gave predictions for the specific heat and the susceptibility which differ from those in  @xcite in the slowly varying multiplicative logarithmic factors : @xmath20 jug studied the @xmath21 line of @xmath22-component spin models in @xmath23 space where @xmath12 is the system s dimensionality , and thereby worked out the logarithmic corrections for the @xmath3 @xmath22-vector model  @xcite .",
    "for the case at hand ( @xmath24 ) , he obtained @xmath25 in  @xcite , geldart and debell confirmed that to obtain the correct powers of @xmath26 the beta function has to be calculated to three loops , but the results of  @xcite differ from those of @xcite in the powers of the logarithms which appear in the specific heat and in the correlation function : @xmath27 finally ballesteros et al .",
    "@xcite extended and corrected aharony s computation to give the correction exponents : @xmath28    so the detailed analytic scaling predictions of at least five groups of authors clash , and a number of questions arise : ( i ) are the predictions from within each author set self - consistent ?",
    "( ii ) what are the full set of predictions ( i.e. , extended to all observables ) coming from each set ? ( iii ) can a simulational approach yield numerical support for the shift in the correction terms from their counterparts in the pure model , and , further , ( iv ) can such a computational approach support one or other of these five different sets of analytic predictions ? here the scaling relation for logarithmic corrections developed in  @xcite are used to accomplish ( ii ) and it is shown that the answers to questions ( i ) and ( iii ) and to some extent ( iv ) are in the affirmative .",
    "in particular , numerical support for the broad scenarios presented in  @xcite is presented .",
    "modification of the self - consistent scaling theory for logarithmic corrections of  @xcite , to incorporate the exponential terms , leads to the following forms for the behaviour of the magnetization in the 4d rsim : @xmath29 from eq.(15 ) of  @xcite , we also write for the scaling of the yang - lee edge @xmath30 the scaling relations for logarithmic corrections in this 4d model are  @xcite ) is modified to read @xmath31 when @xmath21 and when the impact angle of fisher zeros onto the real axis is any value other than @xmath32 , which is not expected to be the case in this 4d model  @xcite . ] @xmath33    these scaling relations are now used to generate a complete scaling picture from the fragments available in the literature  @xcite .",
    "this complete picture is given in table  [ exp_analytic ] , where the exponents of the logarithmic correction terms are listed .",

    "having checked that the leading fss behaviour corresponds to that originating in the gaussian fixed point , and that the logarithmic corrections to scaling are different to those in the pure model , and moreover ( at least in the case of the yang - lee edge ) are broadly compatible with the predictions from the literature  @xcite , we now attempt to distinguish _ between _ these broad predictions . to this end",

    "numerical measurements of the leading critical exponents in the 4d rsim are presented , confirming that the phase transition in this model is governed by the gaussian fixed point .",
