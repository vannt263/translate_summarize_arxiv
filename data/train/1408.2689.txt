    "it is well known nowadays that modifying the law of gravity may lead to possible explanations for the acceleration mechanism of the our universe @xcite .",
    "various theories based on the modification of the law of gravity have been performed , among those , the modified version of the tele - parallel theory of gravity ( tt ) , the so - called @xmath5 gravity , where @xmath6 denotes the torsion scalar .",
    "the teleparallel gravity is a theory equivalent to the general relativity , but does not depend on the levi - civita s connection , as is the case of the gr .",
    "the tt and its modified version are based on the weitzenbock connection where the curvature scalar vanishes whereas the torsion is different from zero . within this theory ,",
    "various works have been developed and interesting results have been found , see @xcite .",
    "note that the observational data are based on the assumption that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic for large scales .",
    "indeed , the matter distribution in the universe is rigorously non - homogeneous and the propagation of the light may not be isotropic . in this way ,",
    "it reasonable to look for at models able to approach this feature of the universe .",
    "this is the goal of this paper .",
    "there are several metric models that traduce the anisotropic feature of the universe but we focus our attention on three of them , the bianchi - i , bianchi - iii and kantowski - sachs .",
    "the motif of using these models is the fact that there their topologies , for large scales , may lead to the well known trivial frw model within physical assumptions .",
    "an important point to be put out here is that the geometrical objects as the torsion and contorsion , which are indispensable for any calculus depend on the so - called tetrad .",
    "the tetrads play an important role and depending on their form , the theory may present some constraints on the gravitational action .",
    "in fact , for diagonal tetrads , constraints appears and the action is reduced to the tt one , with cosmological constant .",
    "however , when the non - diagonal tetrads are considered , the constraints disappear letting free the choice of the action .",
    "our goal is to search for the solutions of these models , say , finding the expression of the scale factor in the three space directions , within the modified tt . as consequence , through the dependence of the content of the universe of the geometrical part of the field equations ,",
    "solutions are found for the energy density and the pressure , showing , as an interesting and important result , that still using anisotropic metric models , our universe may live a quintessence - like phase .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : at the section @xmath7 , we general equation of motion and write down the expression of the energy - momentum tensor within the assumption of inhomogeneous content of the universe .",
    "the section @xmath8 is devoted to the decoupling of the generalized equations following the pressures and the energy density .",
    "still in this section solutions and comments are performed .",
    "the conclusion is presented at the section @xmath9 .",
    "we first define a metric for the geometry of the weitzenbok spacetime as @xmath10 where @xmath11 are the components of the metric which is symmetric and possess @xmath12 degrees of freedom .",

    "we can define the weitzenbock s connection as @xmath19 the main geometrical objects of the spacetime are constructed from this connection .",

    "by setting @xmath31 , the equations of motion ( [ em ] ) are the same as that of the teleparallel theory with a cosmological constant , and this is dynamically equivalent to the gr .",
    "these equations clearly depend on the choice made for the set of tetrads @xcite .",
    "the contribution of the interaction with the matter fields is given by the energy momentum tensor which , is this case , is defined as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the four - velocity , @xmath34 a unitary space - like vector in the radial direction , @xmath35 the energy density , @xmath36 the pressure in the direction of @xmath34 ( radial pressure ) and @xmath37 the pressure orthogonal to @xmath38 ( tangential pressure ) .",
