    "the recent observation of the large elliptic flow at rhic  @xcite together with the high jet energy loss , led to the conjecture that the matter at rhic is strongly coupled , a nearly perfect fluid . on the other hand , monte carlo simulations of qcd ( quantum chromodynamics ) on a discrete lattice ( lattice qcd )",
    "@xcite suggest a quasiparticle picture of the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) , at least for the quarks .",
    "in fact , both flavor - off - diagonal susceptibilities  @xcite and higher order baryon number susceptibilities  @xcite are consistent with vanishing correlations for temperatures right above the transition , @xmath0  @xcite , and appear to be well described by quasiparticle approaches  @xcite .",
    "in addition , effective quark models with a polyakov loop potential ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite ) proved to be quite successful in reproducing the thermodynamics of strongly interacting matter , and an even better agreement was recently found with a ( 2 + 1)-flavor polyakov - quark - meson model  @xcite in the mean - field approximation .",
    "based on these observations , it was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite that the large elliptic flow at rhic could be described by single - particle dynamics with a repulsive interaction .",
    "the same interaction would also explain the ( @xmath1 ) deviation from the stefan - boltzmann limit of the pressure calculated in lattice qcd .",
    "a repulsive mean - field of the vector type was also invoked as a possible explanation for the discordant results of lattice qcd in refs .",
    "@xcite , that appear to disfavor the existence of a critical point in the qcd phase diagram .",
    "the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite observed that the region of quark masses where the transition is of the first order ( for quark masses smaller than the physical ones ) , tends to shrink for small positive values of the chemical potential @xmath2 .",
    "this is in contrast with model studies that support the existence of a critical point . in these",
    ", the first order region has to expand with increasing @xmath2 , so that the physical quark mass point coincides with the critical line at some finite value of @xmath3 and @xmath2 . as was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , a sufficiently strong vector coupling may account for the shrinkage of the first order region , eventually resulting in two critical points for a given range of ( small ) quark masses and in one critical point for physical quark masses  @xcite .",
    "inspired by these ideas , we propose a scheme to estimate the strength of the vector interaction from lattice qcd data on flavor diagonal and off - diagonal susceptibilities .",
    "we will confine ourselves to the light quark doublet and we will assume that , at high temperature , the dependence on the net - baryon density and the isospin density can be described by mean field vector - isoscalar and vector - isovector interactions , respectively .",
    "this is somehow in the same spirit of ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown that lattice data on baryon number susceptibility may be described in terms of a temperature - dependent repulsive vector coupling in the nambu jona - lasinio ( njl ) model .",
    "the vector - isovector coupling , needs also to be taken into account as its relative strength , with respect to the vector - isoscalar coupling , has a strong impact on the flavor off - diagonal susceptibilities  @xcite . in our analysis",
    ", we do not make any specific modeling of the remnant part of the interaction ( that is certainly present in qcd ) .",
    "its effect is taken into account by allowing the vector couplings , as well as the quark thermodynamic potential , to be medium - dependent parameters . within these assumptions",
    ", we will consistently obtain a very simple expression for the flavor diagonal and off - diagonal susceptibilities at zero chemical potential .",
    "the result can be then inverted and the difference between the vector - isoscalar and the vector - isovector coupling can be extracted directly from lattice data using the susceptibilities evaluated in  @xcite as an input .",
    "the strength of both couplings can be then estimated considering two extreme cases that will allow us to obtain lower and upper bounds for these quantities as a function of the temperature .",
    "as we will show , the vector - isoscalar coupling is very large ( repulsive interaction ) immediately below @xmath4 and reaches quickly much lower values above @xmath5 , where it basically coincides with the vector - isovector coupling .",
    "below @xmath4 also the vector - isovector coupling exhibits a similar behavior but remains always smaller than the vector - isoscalar coupling .",

    "<S> we show that flavor diagonal and off - diagonal susceptibilities of light quarks at vanishing chemical potential can be calculated consistently assuming the baryon density and isospin density dependence of qcd to be expressed by a vector - isoscalar and a vector - isovector coupling , respectively . at the mean field level </S>",
    "<S> , their expression depends only on the effective medium - dependent couplings and quark thermodynamic potential . </S>",
    "<S> the strength of the couplings can be then estimated from the model using susceptibilities calculated in lattice qcd as an input . </S>"
