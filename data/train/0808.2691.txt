    "the studies of d - branes and m - branes have certainly been crucial in recent developments of string theory and m - theory .",
    "the classical dynamics of a brane is described by its world - volume theory , which is reparametrization invariant . at the same time",
    ", they are the sources of various gauge fields such as rr - fields . thus the dynamics of their world - volumes",
    "is largely affected by the presence of the various fluxes in string theory and m - theory .    in particular , consider a d2-d0 bound state in type iia string with the rr-3 form flux in the world - volume direction .",
    "then it is well - known that the stable world - volume is given by a two sphere , called the fuzzy sphere ( or dielectric d2-brane ) @xcite .",
    "this configuration can be regarded as a system of multiple d0-branes , which are expanded into a sphere due to the non - abelian rr coupling @xcite . in the beginning of this paper",
    ", we will explicitly construct a supersymmetric fuzzy sphere in the fully back - reacted iia background of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this predicts a new class of supersymmetric states in the dual abjm theory @xcite .    we may naturally think a fuzzy sphere as a rigid body in the low energy limit since it is composed of infinitesimally small and massive constituents ( d0-branes )",
    "this suggests , for example , that we can give it an angular momentum . actually , by colliding closed strings with the fuzzy sphere",
    ", we can excite the angular momentum .",
    "however , naively this contradicts with the d2-brane description because the world - volume theory is reparametrization invariant and there seems no room for adding any angular momenta .",
    "one of the main purposes of this paper is to resolve this puzzle completely .",
    "we argue that the spinning fuzzy ` sphere ' is realized by putting a non - vanishing electric flux so that it produces the non - zero poynting vector together with the magnetic flux due to the d0-brane charge ( see fig.[fuzzyspin ] ) .",
    "even though this is similar to the mechanism of the supertube @xcite , our case is far more non - trivial since the gauss law on the sphere seems to contradict the presence of the electric flux . indeed , as we will show explicitly , the topology of the world - volume is no longer a sphere but it should be changed into a torus in order to realize a stationary spinning configuration .",
    "this topology change is naturally explained by interpreting the sources of electric flux as the fundamental strings attached on the north and south poles of the two sphere as explained in fig.[fuzzyspin ] .",
    "when its angular momentum in the @xmath3 becomes large , the fuzzy torus degenerates into a ring - like object ( ` fuzzy ring ' ) .",
    "since some of such fuzzy rings become bps states , they may resemble supersymmetric black rings @xcite .",
    "another d - brane configuration , which is analogous to the previous example , will be the giant gravitons @xcite .",

    "dual giant gravitons in @xmath4 .",
    "it is a spherical m2-brane with angular momenta ( or r - charges in the dual @xmath5 ) in the @xmath6 direction . as we will show in this paper , its reduction to the type iia string via the orbifolding procedure introduced in @xcite ,",
    "precisely leads to the mentioned spherical dielectric d2-brane in @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , we will construct a spinning dual giant gravitons in m - theory by solving the bps equations explicitly . by reducing them to type iia via the orbifold",

    "this paper is organized as follows : in section two , we briefly review the m - theory on @xmath4 and type iia string on @xmath8 . in section three , we construct a dielectric d2-brane solution in @xmath2 and show that it can be obtained from the reduction of a dual giant graviton in @xmath4 by the orbifolding . in section four , we construct spinning dual giant gravitons in @xmath4 by solving the bps equations . in section five , we obtain the spinning dielectric d2-brane solution in the @xmath2 by taking the orbifold reduction of the spinning giant graviton solutions . in section 6 ,",

    "this leads to the relation @xmath241 .",
    "for example , if we set @xmath243 ( called case ( a ) ) , we do not need to require any of the constraints in ( [ 1/16 ] ) because @xmath244 .",

    "therefore , the spinning dual giant constructed in the previous section will be reduced to a bound state of a d2-brane , @xmath89 d0-branes and @xmath205 f - strings .",

    "this fuzzy torus is a bound state of a d2-brane , d0-branes and f - strings and is spinning due to the poynting vector due to the presence of both electric and magnetic gauge flux .",
