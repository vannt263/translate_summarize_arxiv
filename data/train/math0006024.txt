    "topological quantum field theory @xcite is a rigorous mathematical framework for the feynman path integral formalism , expressed in categorical language .",
    "it is a `` categorification '' of quantum physics , in the broader sense of the term @xcite . together with the progress in quantum groups and geometric quantization ,",
    "there is enough evidence to say that , at a deeper level of understanding , what is referred to in the physical realm as quantum phenomena , corresponds in mathematics to noncommutative geometry ...    ... and , as stated in @xcite , the viewpoint originally due to grothendieck and expressed in @xcite ( p.83 ) is that _ `` to do geometry you really do nt need a space .",
    "all you need is a category of sheaves on this would - be space . '' _    our intention in this essay , is to bring together some ideas and categorical tools , and to state some questions and comments on the categorification of the formalism of quantum mechanics in relation to non - commutative geometry .      since 1930 s general relativity , the physical theories based on geometric methods evolved by adding _ internal degrees of freedom _ to the _ external degrees of freedom _ ( adding `` structure '' to geometric points ) due to the presence of a space - time model , in an attempt to account for the other fundamental interactions .    in kaluza - klein theories",
    "the additional dimensions were still _",
    "external dimensions_. electromagnetism as a @xmath0-yang - mills theory has one additional _ internal dimension _ ,",
    "nonabelian ym still add extra _ internal dimensions _ etc .",
    "one may `` extrapolate '' and `` predict '' that quantum physics of the fundamental interactions should evolve towards a no - external - all - internal dimensions type of theory .",
    "more precisely , we think of quantum field theory being modeled as an abstract theory from which space - time , not anymore a fundamental concept , is reconstructed not necessarily as a limit , but rather as a moduli space from a categorical structure , as part of a _ reduction principle_.    in this abstract theory the basic concept is not the _ space - time event _ ( classical event ) as a potential occurrence or `` existence '' , but rather an _ elementary process _",
    "( quantum event ) .",
    "the _ interaction _ itself should be the primary concept , and not built on top of a preexisting structure .",
    "in mathematical terms this should correspond to the natural evolution from a `` set - theoretical approach '' with emphasis on `` elements + structure '' to a categorical approach with its emphasis on * morphisms * and with the structure given through the category itself .    at the physical level",
    ", one may identify this tendency as part of the process of deemphasizing configuration spaces , and studying poisson manifolds rather then cotangent spaces .",
    "more then that , one should perhaps _ model spaces of evolutions _ in a direct manner , rather then to represent them based on a state space ( e.g. as integral curves ) .",
    "the incompatibility between general relativity and quantum mechanics is well - known and accounted for by the 50 - 60 years of unconvincing attempts to `` quantize gravity '' ( @xcite ) .",
    "there must be a deep reason for the incompatibility between general relativity , a classical - phenomenological - macroscopical theory , and quantum physics , a fundamental - highly experimental theory , and for the unsuccessful attempts to unify gravity with the other fundamental interactions .",
    "perhaps general relativity is an effective theory , as for example fermi theory , which is not `` ... cloaked in the beautiful geometric structure of general relativity , that may lead us astray in our search for a solution to the problem of nonrenormalizability ... '' @xcite , p.74 .",
    "we would like to question our phenomenological understanding of space - time , and recall that there are quantum gravity programs which reject `` the manifold conception of space - time '' @xcite , p.4 .",
    "( see also @xcite , p.2 ) .",
    "we consider that the classical algebraic - geometry - physics point of view : @xmath1 should be replaced by : @xmath2 an abstract c(ategorical)qft , based on representations of quivers or abstract categories , and abandoning the manifold approach to space - time ( compare @xcite ) , should generalize tqfts based on a cobordism category ( see also @xcite , ex.2.2 and remark 2.3 , p.103 ) .",
    "the `` space - time '' should be reconstructed as a prime spectrum of a category , as part of a `` correspondence principle '' , and should not be considered a primary concept .",
    "as an `` example '' to give substance to this idea , one may consider the feynman diagrams as representations of quivers bounding a certain basic quiver specific to the quantum experiment being modeled , and determined by the `` geometry '' and preparation stages of the experiment .",
    "the allowable feynman diagrams bounded by the basic quiver should be related to the cut - off procedures applied to the experimental data .",
    "the divergency of the feynman integrals defined on the reconstructed space , and due to the _ unnecessary abundance of topological paths _ , should be reduced according to a `` hodge - principle '' ( existence of a `` canonical representative '' , e.g. harmonic form ) applied to homotopy classes of paths .",
    "the physical counterpart would be the `` particle - wave duality '' , where the quantum process ( say involving an electron ) behaves `` like a particle '' in an `` irreducible subprocess '' , means that the calculation can be classical , on a geometric path ( the `` hodge representative '' ) , while the overall amplitude is a result of the interference due to the nontrivial homotopy structure of the basic quiver ( integration on the homotopy classes ) , so that overall the quantum process behaves `` like a wave '' , i.e. exhibits interference . due to",
    "the believe that quantum phenomena should be modeled by noncommutative geometry , we consider as a long - term goal to develop a `` finer '' axiomatic theory of quantum mechanics based on spectra of categories of representations of quivers , rather then based on hilbert spaces and operators , in a natural correspondence with noncommutative geometry ( categorical analog of string theory ? ) .    a unification of the fundamental interactions ( without gravity if understood only by macroscopic evidence )",
    ", is then perhaps conceivable not by focusing on finding the `` overall gauge group '' , but at a categorical level , and obtaining `` gravity '' by reduction at the classical level ( on the `` moduli space '' ) , as a byproduct of the unification .",
    "assuming that the  categorification  and",
    " spec  functors should commute , we translate the definition of an affine scheme",
    ".      ideals in additive categories are discussed in @xcite , and in the references cited therein .",
    "let @xmath3 be a additive category , i.e. a category such that for any two objects @xmath4 in @xmath3 , @xmath5 is an object in the category @xmath6 of abelian groups .",
    "a ( bilateral ) _ ideal _ in @xmath3 is a class of morphisms ( subfunctor , @xcite , p.2 ) , stable under addition and composition whenever defined .",
    "more precisely , a left ideal @xmath7 in @xmath3 , is a family of abelian subgroups @xmath8 of @xmath9 indexed by @xmath10 , and such that the family of groups is stable under left composition with arbitrary morphisms @xmath11 : @xmath12^{i(a ) } \\ar@/_1pc/[r]_{i(b ) } \\ar@{}[r]|{\\downarrow i(f ) } & { { \\cala}}b\\\\ a \\ar@{=>}[dr]_{i(a , y ) } \\ar@{=>}[r]^{i(a , x ) } & x \\dto^{\\phi } & i(b , x ) \\dto_{\\phi\\circ \\cdot } \\rto^{\\cdot\\circ f } & i(a , x ) \\dto^{\\phi\\circ\\cdot } \\\\                           &",

    "composing @xmath13 with morphisms from @xmath8 may result in a proper subset of @xmath14 .",
    "the approach in @xcite to define the spectrum of an abelian category leads to a reconstruction theorem extending a know result of gabriel . since we consider that the primary concepts are the morphisms we will adopt another approach .",
    "we will consider the categorification of the usual definition of a prime ideal @xcite , @xcite ( p.2 ) .",

    "an ideal @xmath15 is a _ prime ideal _",
    "iff for any compassable morphisms @xmath16 and @xmath17 , @xmath18 implies either @xmath19 or @xmath20 .",
    "the _ prime spectrum _ of @xmath3 is the class of prime ideals ( or category , if ideals are viewed as subfunctors ) , with the usual zarisky topology ( as a grothendieck topology , to be made precise elsewhere ) .      between sets and categories ,",
    "a _ quiver _ @xmath21 ( or _ precategory _ ) is a `` small category '' without a composition of morphisms .",
    "morphism of quivers _ is a `` functor '' without the condition regarding the composition of morphisms , since there is none yet defined .",
    "the category of quivers @xmath22 relates to the ( 2-)category of small categories @xmath23 similar to how sets relates to monoids .",
    "there is a forgetful functor @xmath24 , with a left adjoint @xmath25 , giving the free category generated by a given quiver : @xmath26 @xmath27 is also called the _ path category _ generated by @xmath21 .",
    "let @xmath28 be an arbitrary category and @xmath29 a ring , e.g. @xmath30 .",
    "consider the category @xmath31 with the same objects as @xmath28 and with morphisms the free @xmath29-modules generated by the morphisms of the category @xmath28 .",
    "then @xmath3 is a @xmath29-linear category , and in particular additive , in an obvious way .    to an arbitrary @xmath29-linear small category ( additive , if @xmath32 )",
    ", one may associate a @xmath29-algebra ( algebra ) , called its _ matrix algebra _ ( see @xcite , p.33 ) .",
    "the matrix algebra of the free @xmath29-linear category associated to the path category generated by a quiver @xmath21 is the _ path algebra _ @xmath33 .",
    "it is a categorification of the group ring construction , corresponding to the `` multi - object '' case .",
    "explicitly , on generators , the product of two paths is zero , unless they produce a concatenated new path @xcite ( p.146 ) .",
    "note that any additive category @xmath3 is a quotient of a path category @xmath34 by the kernel ( ideal in @xmath35 ) of the path evaluation ( by composition ) functor :    alternatively , the elements of @xmath36 may be viewed as singular simplices , i.e. functors from the standard simplex ( semisimplicial category ) @xmath37 to @xmath3 ( @xcite , p.8 ) . in this way morphisms",
    "may be thought of as 1-simplices , and the path algebra , as a @xmath29-module , is just the ( graded ) free @xmath29-module generated by singular simplices of ( categorical ) singular homology .    a _ representation of quivers _",
    "@xmath38 is a morphism of quivers valued in a category of modules .",
    "it extends uniquely to a functor @xmath39 .",
    "if @xmath32 , then it is a @xmath27-module @xcite ( p.140 ) , @xcite ( p.171 ) .",
    "a morphism of representations of quivers is a restriction ( with respect to morphisms ) of a natural transformation of functors .    regarding the quantum mechanics formalism , considering representations of quivers rather then vector spaces represents a gain in the initial structure involved .",
    "the idea of generalizing the ordinary `` commutative '' geometry by studying non - commutative algebras goes back to von neumann and his contemporaries @xcite ( p.253 ) .",
    "the inconvenience is that such an algebra might not have enough ideals ( `` global '' ideal , contrasted to categorical ideals ) .",
    "it is a `` pointless geometry '' .",
    "we point out that there is a well known correspondence between the one object ,  total ",
    "algebra , point of view and the multi - objects point of view , where additive categories are just  rings with several objects  @xcite ( groupoids = multi - object groups , etc . ) . for a more detailed discussion of this correspondence , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we only note that to a finite dimensional algebra @xmath40 over an algebraic closed field @xmath29 , one may associate the alexander - reiten quiver , having vertices ( objects ) isomorphism classes of indecomposable @xmath40-modules ( i.e. @xmath41 ) , and arrows bases in a certain group of irreducible maps @xcite ( p.181 ) .",
    "if @xmath40 is a basic algebra @xcite ( p.147 ) , then @xmath40 is of the form @xmath42 with @xmath43 a quiver and @xmath7 an ideal in @xmath44 .",
    "feynman path integral formalism leads to mathematical difficulties , one may argue , due to the philosophy `` * space determines the paths * '' .",
    "for example , once a typical `` space - time '' is given , the set of `` acceptable paths '' is determined ( topological , or smooth , piecewise smooth , etc . ) , leading to an unnecessary large space for integration in the lagrangean formalism .",
    "consistent with the emphasis of quantum processes / nc - geometry on : @xmath45 it is legitimate to require having the `` points '' * and * `` paths '' given at the same time , as a category for example .",
    "the structure of the category encoded in morphisms and their composition @xmath46 , has a causal character (  local time  ) , while a monoidal structure @xmath47 models the  spatial structure  .",
    "we will consider the elementary interference experiment with electrons as explained in @xcite ( p.37 - 5 ) :    from which the `` first principles of quantum mechanics '' are derived .",
    "_ `` an experiment is one in which all of the initial and final conditions of the experiment are completely specified . ''",
    "what we will call * an event * is , in general , just a specific set of initial and final conditions . _",
    "( @xcite p.37 - 10 )    a categorical mind might choose to interpret initial and final conditions as objects , more specifically sources and targets ( e.g. tqfts , @xcite ) .",
    "we will consider the following principle :    to any _ quantum experiment _ there is an _ associated quiver _ corresponding to the `` geometry '' of the experiment , including the source(s ) , preparation stages and finally , the measurement devices .    a perturbative approach would consider quivers ( diagrams ) containing it , and should be thought of as a _ bounding quiver_. a filtering of the experimental data ( cut - off procedure ) , would alter the class of allowable quivers corresponding to this bounding quiver .    for the above experiment , it is reasonable to prescribe the following quiver @xmath21 and representation @xmath48 : @xmath49^{{\\bf s } } & & { { \\boldc}}{{\\calg}}\\\\ & \\overset{2}{\\bullet }   \\urto _ { } & } \\ ] ] a gauge group @xmath50 interpreted as a one object category @xmath51 , and an action functor @xmath52 as a representation of the quiver ( valued in the additive category @xmath53 ) , are also associated : @xmath54 with @xmath55 a geometric lagrangean @xmath56 .",
    "_ when an event can occur in several alternative ways , the probability amplitude for the event is the sum of the probabilities amplitudes for each way considered separately . _",
    "( @xcite p.37 - 10 )    the alternative ways for an interaction , or `` paths '' , should be viewed as morphisms ( e.g. cobordisms in tqfts @xcite ) , and the amplitude is : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the @xmath59-linear category of paths generated by @xmath21 . here the integration is just the summation over the `` possible ways '' ( morphisms ) constituting the `` event '' .",
    "alternatively , the amplitude can be viewed as an integral over the prime spectrum of the path category , and consisting of the two maximal ideals : @xmath60 @xmath61 with the appropriate definition of the amplitude on each `` nc - point '' .",
