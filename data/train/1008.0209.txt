    "emergence can be defined as the appearance of rich structures on a large scale resulting from a multiplicity of simple interactions at a considerably smaller scale .",
    "collective animal motion is a paradigmatic example of such an emergent phenomenon .",
    "depending on the species , there may exist different hierarchical levels that determine how collective displacements are realized .",
    "for example , in primate groups , an individual s dominance status can affect its role in initializing collective movement . in the case of swarming locusts",
    "no such hierarchies are present ; the ability of each individual to guide the band appears to be distributed relatively evenly throughout the insect group .",
    "herein we will concentrate on groups of wingless locust nymphs which form marching bands rather than flying swarms @xcite .",
    "the onset of collective motion in locusts was experimentally demonstrated in @xcite , where it was shown that sufficiently large insect densities placed in a ring - shaped arena gave rise to a coherent displacement of the band .",
    "low densities were characterized by random dispersal of the individuals , while for intermediate densities the coherent motion was interrupted by sudden changes of direction ( hereafter referred to as `` switches '' ) .",
    "this phenomenology was partially rationalized by means of an adapted model based on that of czirk _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , who formulate a paradigmatic model for collective animal behavior in one dimension . in their original model",
    "the position , @xmath0 , and velocity , @xmath1 , of locust @xmath2 are evolved using the following two rules , identical for each individual , @xmath3 , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the total number of locusts . here",
    "@xmath6 is the mean of the nondimensionalised velocities of locusts within a certain radius , @xmath7 , of the position , @xmath0 , of locust @xmath2 .",
    "the function @xmath8 is such that @xmath9 $ ] for a positive constant @xmath10 , where @xmath11 denotes the sign of @xmath12 .",
    "the role of @xmath8 is to adjust the average nondimensionalised velocity perceived by each particle towards unity .",
    "@xmath13 is a constant associated with the chosen time scale and @xmath14 is a random number drawn from the uniform distribution in @xmath15 $ ] . the adapted version of the model used in @xcite to model the movements of locust nymphs in a quasi - one - dimensional arena takes the form @xmath16\\mbox{d}t + \\beta_1 \\mbox{d}w_i , \\qquad \\text{for   } i=1 , \\dots , n,\\ ] ] where @xmath17 denotes the increments of independent wiener processes , @xmath18 is a positive constant describing the amplitude of the noise and the function @xmath8 is as above .    a biologically motivated refinement of the model described by eq .",
    "was given in @xcite , where it was postulated that individual locusts increase the randomness of their movements in response to a loss of group alignment .",
    "this behavior is the result of a particular multiplicative form of the noise term ( see eq . ) , as opposed to the additive noise in eq . ; this characteristic was shown to increase the coherence of the group motion and to reduce the frequency of direction switches @xcite .",
    "the key point in the analysis performed in @xcite was the estimation of coefficients of an effective fokker - planck equation ( fpe ) @xcite , which is written in terms of a macroscopic ( low - dimensional ) observable @xcite , the average velocity of the marching group , derived directly from the experimental data . in the present work we approximate the drift and diffusion coefficients of the effective fpe by analytical functions .",
    "this permits a more thorough analysis and fosters further understanding of collective dynamics of locusts .",
    "in addition we compare our results with those of eq .  , and discuss the disparities between the two models .",
    "coarse - grained analysis @xcite allows us to obtain an effective fpe describing the collective behavior of the locusts at the macroscopic level . by using this coarse - graining technique",
    "( see @xcite ) we were able to extract the coefficients of the assumed underlying fpe describing the alignment of the locusts from the experimental data presented in [ 1 ] .",
    "this approach enables us to reduce our system - comprising a large number of degrees of freedom - to a single collective variable , @xmath12 , ( referred to variably , hereafter , as ` alignment ' or ` average velocity ' ) which characterizes the system s macroscopic behavior .",
    "the proposed fpe has a simple form and it can be expressed as @xmath19 + { \\frac{\\beta_2}{n } } \\partial_{uu}[(1-u^2 ) p],\\ ] ] for the probability @xmath20 of finding the system with an average velocity in the interval @xmath21 during the time interval @xmath22 ; note that the experimental situation in @xcite is quasi - one - dimensional , allowing the use of a one - dimensional fpe @xcite .",
    "we note that this fpe corresponds to the following langevin equation for the average velocity @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the increments of a wiener process and the multiplicative noise is interpreted in the it sense , as prescribed by the experimentally obtained fpe  ( [ fp ] ) . in these equations",
    "the average velocity @xmath12 is dimensionless and takes its values in the interval @xmath25 $ ] .",
    "the values such that @xmath26 characterize the ideal situation in which all locusts march in perfect coherence ; the sign determines the direction . of course , formally substituting @xmath26 in eq .",
    "( [ langevin ] ) produces a divergence in the drift , so for practical reasons one has to assume that coherent motion implies @xmath27 rather than a strict equality .",
    "the value @xmath28 characterizes a total disorder ; realistic values of the average velocity lie between these two extreme cases .",
    "although the average velocity is a dimensionless quantity in eqs .",
    "( [ fp ] ) and ( [ langevin ] ) , time is not .",
    "consequently @xmath29 and @xmath30 have the dimensions of time@xmath31 .",
    "we shall estimate in the following their numerical values using the experimental data from  @xcite and express them in units of seconds@xmath31 .",
    "the proposed fpe describing the alignment is a reasonably accurate approximation to the unknown fpe assumed to underly the motion of the locusts , which captures their experimental swarming behavior .",
    "it should be noted that such an equation can only be obtained if the system being studied is amenable to this sort of reduction .",
    "for asymptotically large values of @xmath5 , parameter @xmath32 ( in equation  ) denotes the order of magnitude of the relaxation time characterizing how long it takes the entire group to become ordered when starting from a disordered configuration , and @xmath33 indicates the order of magnitude of the characteristic time over which the fluctuations of the mean velocity develop . for the range of experimentally considered locust numbers ( @xmath34 ) the observed values of @xmath29 and @xmath30 are approximately constant while we expect the presence of a boundary layer for smaller values of @xmath5 .",
    "since our results in @xcite are rather noisy our goal is to fit the order of magnitude of the model parameters instead of attempting to obtain precise estimates . comparing the proposed analytical coefficients of eq . to those obtained in @xcite , from the experimental data in @xcite",
    ", we obtain @xmath35 . employing the mean switching time measurements in @xcite we find @xmath36 and @xmath37 .    the fpe corresponding to eq .",

    "( [ uczirok ] ) .",
    "the stationary solution of the fpe  ( [ vicsek ] ) can be derived as follows : @xmath40\\label{equation : revisedmodelspd}.\\ ] ] the values of the two maxima of this stationary probability distribution ( spd ) @xmath41 and the minimum @xmath42 are independent of the parameter values .",
    "this type of system has been considered many times in the literature  @xcite , and we include it here simply for completeness and comparison with the refined model  ( [ langevin ] ) .    in the absence of sources and sinks of probability",
    ", we can also derive the spd of the experimentally motivated fpe  : @xmath43,\\ ] ] where @xmath44 \\right ] \\mbox{d}u$ ] is the inverse of the normalization constant .",
    "this spd is bounded , compactly supported in @xmath25 $ ] and bimodal for all values of the parameters .",
    "noise induced transitions have been studied traditionally by means of the dynamics of the extrema of the spd @xcite . for the biologically motivated fpe",
    "the spd shows one minimum always located at @xmath42 , and two maxima at @xmath45 , which exist for all parameter values .",
    "one immediately notes @xmath46 , a fact related to the shape of the `` deterministic potential '' ( the potential in the absence of noise ) , which is the negative integral of the drift coefficient , @xmath47.\\ ] ] this potential is bistable with one maximum located at the origin and two minima at @xmath48 independent of the parameter values . for increasing noise intensity the probability maxima of the spd   ( corresponding to the biologically motivated fpe ) separate from the deterministic potential minima @xmath48 and approach the boundary points @xmath49 .",
    "these facets of the spd , when considered in the context of the classical theory of noise induced transitions , imply that the system is becoming ordered @xcite : the spd maxima , representing the states in which the system will most likely be found , are further apart and thus there is a clearer differentiation among those states .",
    "however , the experimental evidence , based on switching times which decrease as the noise magnitude increases , reveals that the system becomes disordered @xcite .",
    "this indicates that for complex systems , restricting the characterization of the dynamics to observations of the evolution of the extrema may not be adequate in some experimentally motivated situations .",
    "herein we will try to carry out a more complete characterization .",
    "another indicator of order / disorder is the barrier height of the effective potential . for the model given by eq .",
    "( 1 ) the barrier height decreases monotonically as the noise intensity increases as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ equations : originalmodelpotentialandbarrier ] ) @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the effective potential and @xmath52 the corresponding barrier height .    the effective potential for our revised model ( eq . )",
    "is given as @xmath53 = \\frac{n\\alpha_2}{2\\beta_2(1-u^2)}+\\left ( 1+\\frac{n\\alpha_2}{2\\beta_2 } \\right)\\ln(1-u^2),\\ ] ] and the corresponding barrier height is @xmath54 as a function of noise intensity the barrier height exhibits a minimum at @xmath55_{\\min } \\approx 0.76 $ ] .",
    "this means that for @xmath56_{\\min}$ ] ( sub - threshold ) the barrier height diminishes for stronger noise , but for @xmath57_{\\min}$ ] ( super - threshold ) it increases as the noise strength grows .",
    "indeed , @xmath58(n\\alpha_2/\\beta_2)$ ] when @xmath59 and @xmath60 when @xmath61 .",
    "this suggests that , while increased noise causes the system to become more disordered for sub - threshold noise intensities , super - threshold intensities might cause the system to become more ordered as the noise grows . in short",
    ", the ` barrier height ' order parameter shows a clear non - monotonicity when considered as a function of noise strength .",
    "this appears like a counterintuitive reentrant behavior , where the noise can have an ordering effect for supercritical intensities  @xcite .",
    "although this behavior is interesting in itself , it is not biologically relevant , as it requires a number of individuals @xmath62 , beyond the validity of the model",
    ". both characteristics of the spd ( [ sprobability ] ) of our refined model , displacement of the location of the maxima and non - monotonic variation of the barrier height , can be seen in fig .",
    "[ spdf ] - .",
    "let us note that noise induced non - equilibrium phase transitions  @xcite as well as other noise mediated ordering phenomena  @xcite have been exhaustively studied in the literature .",
    "this includes the detailed study of reentrant transitions  @xcite .",
    "however , most of these approaches have assumed multiplicative noise interpreted in the stratonovich sense .",
    "the stratonovich interpretation is able to destabilize a deterministically stable state and in this way produce phase transitions or other noise induced phenomena .",
    "the key technical point in these cases is the appearance of a systematic contribution to the deterministic dynamics coming from the noise term , the so - called `` stratonovich drift ''  @xcite .",
    "therefore noise interpretation plays a fundamental role in the development of these types of phenomena : in particular , many noise induced phenomena are not possible if the noise interpretation is that of it . in this respect ,",
    "our results are fundamentally different as we only consider the it interpretation for our langevin equation with multiplicative noise  ( [ langevin ] ) .",
    "we also note that noise induced phase transitions which are independent of the noise interpretation have also been studied  @xcite , but in much less detail .",
    "the mechanisms leading to these phase transitions are based on the bifurcation of the minima of an effective potential due to noise and , as such , constitute the natural extension of noise induced transitions  @xcite to spatially extended systems .",
    "our results relate to a zero dimensional system as do those in  @xcite , but they are significantly different as the model defined by eq .",
    "( [ langevin ] ) does not describe this kind of bifurcation .",
    "we can further explore the model properties by considering the mean switching time , @xmath63 , defined as the first time , on average , that the alignment of the system , @xmath12 , initialized such that @xmath64 , reaches the origin ( @xmath28 ) . for our revised model",
    "the moments of the switching time distribution are given , recursively , by the solution of the equation @xmath65 subject to the boundary conditions @xmath66 and @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the @xmath69 moment , correspondingly , @xmath70 is the mean switching time and @xmath71 .",
    "the second boundary condition represents zero probability flux through @xmath72 .",
    "eq . is directly derived from the fpe using methods from @xcite .",
    "the solution to this equation for @xmath73 is @xmath74(1-v^2)^{n\\alpha_2/\\beta_2}\\int_{-1}^v \\exp \\left [ -\\frac{n\\alpha_2/(2\\beta_2)}{1-w^2 } \\right](1-w^2)^{-1-n\\alpha_2/\\beta_2 } \\mbox{d}w \\mbox{d}v . \\nonumber\\ ] ] this expression appears complicated , but one can derive its asymptotic expansion for large values of @xmath75 ( which implies large @xmath5 as @xmath29 and @xmath30 are approximately constant ) by means of a kramers - like approximation  @xcite .",
    "it has the simple form @xmath76 , which reveals a pure exponential growth in the inverse noise intensity @xmath75 for asymptotically large values .",
    "further moments of the switching time distribution can be calculated from eq .   for @xmath77 .",
    "in the limit @xmath78 one finds the relation @xmath79 .",
    "this relationship implies , in turn , that the switching process is a poisson process .",
    "we can also compute the first passage time for the model eq .  .",
    "in this case we solve the equation @xmath80\\partial_u t + \\frac{\\beta_1}{n}\\partial_{uu}t=-1 $ ] , subject to the boundary conditions @xmath66 and @xmath81 , where the latter condition is the analogue of the previous zero flux condition adapted for an spd with infinite support .",
    "we find @xmath82 \\left\\ { 2-\\mathrm{erfc } \\left [ \\sqrt{\\frac{\\alpha_1 n}{2 \\beta_1}}(1+v ) \\right ] \\right\\ } \\mbox{d}v,\\ ] ] which also behaves exponentially in @xmath5 for large values of @xmath5 but this time with an @xmath5 dependent prefactor ( see supplementary information of @xcite ) .",
    "the relation between these two mean switching times ( the model eq .   and that of the revised model @xcite ) is extensively discussed in @xcite , so we will not reproduce the discussion here .",
    "now we compare the theoretical results with the exponential fitting we have performed on experimental data from @xcite for both the first and second moments of the switching time distribution .",
    "the data are insufficient for us to reliably obtain any moments higher than the second . for the mean switching time @xmath83 and second moment @xmath84 we found @xmath85 \\ , s , \\quad \\sqrt{t_2/2 } = ( 1300 \\pm 190 ) \\exp[(0.041 \\pm 0.008)n ] \\ , s.\\ ] ] according to the relation @xmath79 for the moments of the exponential distribution",
    ", these two values should be the same if the switching process were poissonian .",
    "note that the exponential growth is the same for both ( within errors ) , while the prefactor is larger for the second moment .",
    "this suggests that the switching process is poissonian for large @xmath5 , that is , the probability distribution for the switching events is @xmath86 . for small values of @xmath5",
    "the behavior is more stochastic , as signaled by the larger prefactor of the second moment ( when @xmath5 is small the prefactor dominates over the exponential ) .",
    "if the switching process is poissonian then this has a series of consequences concerning predictability : the standard deviation being equal to the mean implies a 100% error in predictions .",
    "furthermore , switching events are uncorrelated and the distribution tail falls off exponentially for long times .",
    "this allows for a higher probability of rare events than would be allowed by a gaussian tail .",
    "this also implies that the switching process is markovian , as predicted by the fpe .",
    "this can be seen from the double - welled fpe ( [ fp ] ) in the large @xmath5 limit . after a short time the system relaxes to one potential minimum where it stays an exponentially long time until the switch occurs .",
    "since practically all switches start at the minimum this erases the memory and the markov property is recovered .",
    "the verification of this theoretical prediction by the experimental data suggests that no important correlations have been suppressed in the coarse - grained computation in  @xcite , and that this method , and the fpe ( [ fp ] ) , are suitable to describe the locust dynamics exhibited by the experimental data .",
    "another indicator of the stochastic properties of the system is the second moment , which measures the spread of the mean velocity , @xmath12 , with respect to some reference value .",
    "we consider two variants , one centered at the origin @xmath87 , and one centered at one of the maxima of the probability distribution @xmath88 .",
    "of course , the value of @xmath89 is the same for both maxima as a consequence of the symmetry of the system .",
    "these integrals have been computed numerically and are represented in fig .",
    "[ spdf ] , centered at the origin , and [ spdf ] centered at a maximum .",
    "both show non - monotonic behavior in noise intensity , but attain their minima for different values of the noise amplitude .",
    "this non - monotonic behavior , as well as the behavior of the effective barrier height , are not reflected in the relationship between mean switching time and the size of the noise parameter ( @xmath75 ) : the mean switching time grows monotonically with noise amplitude . for comparison",
    "we note that both moments @xmath90 and @xmath89 grow monotonically with the inverse noise intensity in the model given by eq .",
    "; in this case they are @xmath91 there is another feature of the second moments of the revised model @xcite , in addition to the non - monotonic behavior , that reveals new characteristics of the collective motion of locusts not reflected by the model eq .  .",
    "in this model a reduction in the number of individuals increases the values of both second moments . in the stronger noise situation",
    "the probability distribution tails grow , which implies that there are more individuals with a higher ( absolute value ) velocity . in our case",
    "the probability is compactly supported in @xmath25 $ ] , as a consequence of the biological fact that the propagation can not be better than perfect .",
    "for realistic values of the parameters the system is in the weak noise regime ( see fig .",
    "[ spdf ] ) .",
    "this means that the second moment centered at the origin decreases for a decreasing number of locusts , exactly the opposite trend to that of the model eq .  .",
    "the reason is that the probability of finding the system in the neighborhood of @xmath28 grows considerably for stronger noise ( as reflected by the decreasing barrier height ) , largely compensating for the drift of the maxima towards the boundaries of the support of the spd .",
    "the experimentally derived value of @xmath92 for @xmath93 agrees with the minimizing value of the second moment centered at a maximum , @xmath94 ( see fig .",
    "[ spdf ] ) .",
    "this implies that its behavior is not very sensitive to small changes in the number of locusts .",
    "we have seen that the fpe obtained from the coarse - grained analysis of experimental data on the movement of locusts shows an interesting phenomenology .",
    "different indicators of order / disorder may vary non - monotonically with noise intensity , possibly in a contradictory manner .",
    "these findings reveal that these indicators might not be suitable for the biologically motivated models studied in this paper .",
    "we have also shown that the direction switches are independently distributed for large numbers of individuals .",
    "this makes them almost unpredictable from a practical viewpoint .",
    "it seems that directional switches are produced by an accumulation of errors ( made by the locusts when trying to adapt their velocity to that of their neighbors ) that ordinarily interfere and cancel each other out but , over exponentially long times , have the possibility of accumulating and producing a switch . according to the results presented here ,",
    "specifically the confirmation of the poissonian character of the switching events , it seems possible that directional switches are produced as a consequence of the ergodic random evolution of the system .",
    "we note the similarity of this process with ising model ergodic magnetization changes  @xcite . indeed , the model of eq .",
    "( [ uczirok ] ) can be thought of as an ising model with moving spins .",
    "it seems that the ergodic nature of the finite size ising model is preserved despite introducing movement of the spins .",
    "more importantly it seems that this is a plausible explanation , in the absence of external stimuli , of the sudden changes of direction observed in animal groups .",
