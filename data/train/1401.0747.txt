    "the possibility of @xmath1-nuclear quasi - bound states was first discussed by haider and liu @xcite a long time ago .",
    "the existence of such states has been elusive , however . at this moment",
    "the experimental evidence is rather indirect , getting the most clear indication from the measurements of @xmath2he  @xcite and of @xmath3he  @xcite , and from the realization @xcite that the rapid slope of the cross section close to threshold may be a signal of a quasi - bound state .",
    "the same behavior of the total - cross section was also confirmed in the photon induced reaction @xmath4he",
    "@xmath5he  @xcite .",
    "the slope indicates large scattering length , but the final state @xmath6he interaction does not allow to determine the sign of this length which would demonstrate that either a bound state or a virtual state is observed .",
    "additional information is necessary .",
    "one possibility is to use the @xmath7 reaction on a three - nucleon target .",
    "such an analysis indicates that the @xmath6he system is not a bound but a virtual state @xcite .",
    "analogical enhancement close to the kinematic threshold was observed in the total cross - section of the @xmath8he@xmath9 reaction  @xcite .",
    "again , these results suggest a large scattering length , however , do not give a conclusive answer whether the bound state exists .",
    "having the scattering length @xmath10 one may extrapolate the scattering matrix @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the @xmath13 relative momentum , at some distance below the threshold . in this region @xmath14 becomes complex , @xmath15 . for real @xmath16",
    "one obtains the zero of the denominator and the singularity of the @xmath17 matrix on the physical sheet .",
    "that means a bound state for which i m @xmath18 becomes a quasi - bound state . in case of real @xmath19 the zero of denominator may also happen but for @xmath20 , it lays on the second riemann sheet of the complex energy plane .",
    "such a state is called virtual and makes an analogy of nucleon - nucleon , spin 0 , isospin 1 state known as anti - deuteron ( named so because of opposite sign of the pole position in the i m @xmath12 axis ) .",
    "going some distance below the threshold ( usually a short distance as @xmath10 depends on energy and equation  [ i1 ] with constant @xmath10 looses its applicability)one may notice different behavior of @xmath21 in both cases . for a bound or quasi - bound state @xmath21 grows up until the energy of the bound state is reached . on the other hand , in case of a virtual state @xmath21 drops down immediately below the threshold",
    ".    direct observation of the elastic scattering amplitude below the threshold is not feasible .",
    "however , one can observe a similar behavior in channels coupled to the channel where the bound state is suspected to exist .",
    "thus in the case of reaction @xmath22 the channel of interest is @xmath23he and the decay channel consists of three particles @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "as the @xmath26he system seems almost bound , the @xmath23he system is likely to be bound .",
    "the @xmath27he might be expected to be the dominant decay channel . in such circumstances",
    "one could expect a subthreshold enhancement in the cross section for reaction ( [ i2 ] ) .",
    "surprisingly , there is no experimental confirmation of such an effect .",
    "measurements  @xcite , offer a cross section of about 200 @xmath28 which is apparently due to a quasi - free reaction .",
    "an upper limit of the fraction that proceeds through a quasi - bound state is obtained at a level of 25 @xmath28  @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to calculate / estimate the magnitude of @xmath29 reactions and to offer some speculations on the existence of the @xmath30 state .",
    "consider transition of two initial particles denoted by @xmath31 into two particles @xmath32 of a higher mass threshold .",
    "particles @xmath33 are assumed to form an unstable , @xmath34-wave , bound state @xmath35 of energy @xmath36 and width @xmath37",
    ". there may be several modes of decay of this bound state and corresponding partial widths are denoted by @xmath38 .",
    "the reaction of interest consists of three steps    @xmath39 colliding @xmath40 particles generate unstable state @xmath35 ,    @xmath41 unstable state @xmath35 lives for some time and    @xmath42 the unstable state @xmath35 decays into state @xmath43 .    in this section all these stages of reaction",
    "are described in a phenomenological way .",
    "the formulation used below is general but some approximations are made for a specific case : @xmath44 deuteron , @xmath45he and @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath39it is assumed that the basic initial reaction @xmath47 has been studied experimentally in some region above the @xmath33 threshold .",
    "the relevant cross section @xmath48 in the threshold region may be presented in the form @xmath49 where the threshold behavior is described in part by @xmath50 - the relative momentum in the @xmath33 channel .",
    "the function @xmath51 is to be extracted from experiment . with deeply bound or broad states",
    "@xmath51 is a weakly energy dependent function , for weak binding it may indicate a sharp threshold peak .",
    "this cross section is generated by an operator @xmath52 which in a standard way allows to calculate the related scattering amplitude @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 is the reduced mass and @xmath50,@xmath56 are the relative momenta in the corresponding channels .",
    "the cross section becomes @xmath57 a difficulty arises at this stage : from the scattering experiments one can extract @xmath58 which is the modulus of the on - shell transition amplitude for a given momentum @xmath50 while one needs the transition to the bound state @xmath59 . formally @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the wave function of the bound state in the momentum space .",
    "equation ( [ c5 ] ) involves integration over all momenta @xmath50 and not only over the momenta allowed by the energy conservation . to proceed without a specific model of @xmath52",
    "we assume that the spacial range of this operator is characterized by the size of the final particle b ( that is @xmath62he in the case of interest ) .",
    "this is the basic approximation of this calculation , @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the profile of single nucleon wave function in nucleus @xmath65 folded over @xmath66nucleon interaction range and @xmath67 is a constant determined from the slope of the cross section . for an estimate we use a gaussian @xmath68 and to simplify the estimate we assume the bound state wave function in the same form @xmath69^{3/4 }   \\label{c7bis}\\ ] ]    @xmath41 the propagation of the bound state is described by @xmath70 where the complex part of the energy corresponds to the total decay rate .",
    "@xmath71 decay of the @xmath35 state into final @xmath72 state is given by an operator @xmath73 .",
    "the matrix element of this operator between the bound and the final state @xmath74 determines the partial width of the state .",
    "the fermi formula gives @xmath75 from which we obtain @xmath76 in this calculation it is assumed that @xmath77he is a spectator in the decay process and the final decay energy is carried by the meson and the proton . for simplicity the non - relativistic phase space is used .",
    "this may look suspicious in the @xmath78 meson case but the relevant reduced mass drops out from the final expression of the cross section .",
    "this calculation may be easily improved anyway . here",
    "it serves also as a check of the normalization used .",
    "the transition matrix element for the process in question is given by @xmath79 the related scattering amplitude is as in equation ( [ c3 ] ) @xmath80 and the cross section @xmath81    collecting all factors and approximations the formula @xmath82 is obtained where the two radii were set equal @xmath83 .",
    "the factor @xmath84 may be obtained from experimental cross sections measured and collected in ref.@xcite . with the expected values @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 one obtains @xmath88 at the peak .",
    "the result is most sensitive to the radius @xmath89 but the numbers obtained are below the experimental limit .",
    "however , the relation to the actual experimental limit is not that straightforward .",
    "it is the interference of reaction  [ i3 ] with the quasi - free reaction that generates the experimental limit of 25 @xmath28 .",
    "this requires specific models and phase relations .",
    "at this moment the question :",
    "can not be fully answered neither by experiment nor by theory .",
    "simple , old calculations of the threshold behavior in @xmath26he and @xmath23he systems @xcite indicated a @xmath23he bound state . since then two basic ingredients have changed :          the latter is represented by a best fit to multi - channel scattering data obtained in ref.@xcite and plotted in figure 1 .",
    "an average energy involved in the @xmath92 center of mass amounts to - 36 mev ( 21 mev binding and about 14 mev of the residual nucleus recoil ) . so far below the threshold",
    "the absorptive part of the amplitude is fairly small and the rate of @xmath93 decay might be strongly reduced . that reduces the chance of observation via the reaction ( [ i3 ] ) .",
    "this plot shows also that the attractive nuclear potential related to re @xmath94 may be weaker than in the @xmath26he case which involves about @xmath95 mev subthreshold extrapolation .    on the other hand ,",
    "the decay of the @xmath23he bound state into two nucleon mode may be strongly enhanced .",
    "a phenomenological evaluation of the rates is possible as the cross sections for @xmath96 @xmath97 @xmath98 have been measured in the close to threshold region  @xcite .",
    "the analysis based on the detailed balance corrected for final state interaction has been performed in ref .",
    "@xcite . at central nuclear densities the related absorptive potential of the @xmath99 profile with a strength i m",
    "@xmath100 mev was obtained .",
    "however , helium nucleus is twice as dense and the corresponding absorptive potential rises to i m @xmath101 mev .",
    "such strong absorption may prevent binding or lead to much larger level width . to resolve some of the problems it would be useful to have also measurements of another @xmath102 decay process .    from the experimental field , the ongoing analysis of the reactions @xmath103 and @xmath104 @xmath105 from wasa - at - cosy , which will reach the sensitivity of several nb  @xcite , should help to answer the question of the existence of the bound state .",
