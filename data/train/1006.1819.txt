    "the interaction of shock waves with flow inhomogeneities attracted the attention of scientists working in different fields , ranging from aerodynamics @xcite , shock tube research @xcite , laser fusion @xcite and astrophysics @xcite .",
    "the physics of the interaction has been described theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite . in the last decades ,",
    "the advent of super computers provided a sophisticated and accurate tool with which to follow the details of that interaction @xcite .",
    "however , the development of analytical works is an important and complementary way to guide in the design of numerical simulations and experiments .",
    "this work is a natural continuation of a previous article @xcite , in which the interaction of a planar shock with a pre - shock turbulent vorticity perturbation field was considered , with the help of an analytical theory .",
    "the shock / density field interaction has been studied in the recent past by different researches with the help of numerical simulations .",
    "rotman @xcite provided results of that study assuming 2d perturbations upstream of the shock and mahesh _ et al _ @xcite studied a full 3d spectrum of steady state density perturbations . with the help of 2d large eddy simulations ( les )",
    ", rotman described the interaction of a shock wave with random vorticity and density fields separately .",
    "for both cases , he noticed that shock compression waves greatly amplifies the upstream turbulence and reduces the turbulent length scales @xcite . on the other hand , mahesh _ et al _",
    "have used direct numerical simulations ( dns ) to study the interaction of a combined spectrum of pre - shock vorticity and density inhomogeneities . besides , the problem considered here is of importance in the field of inertial confinement fusion ( icf ) , where a sequence of well tuned shocks must be launched inside the thermonuclear foam targets .",
    "the use of foams has been proposed over 20 years ago to improve the stability of the implosion and give an effective smoothing of the laser energy deposition process @xcite . however , given the non uniform character of the background density through which the first shock travels inside the target , it is clear that the shock front will dynamically react against those perturbations , generating additional density , vorticity and acoustic fluctuations in the compressed fluid , much in the same way as happens in the shock / vorticity interaction studied in @xcite and references therein .",
    "the anisotropic turbulent spectrum left by the shock front can act as a trigger for further hydrodynamic instabilities and mixing .",
    "[ ht ]    in this work we present a completely analytical model to study the outcome of the interaction of a planar shock front with a non uniform pre - shock 2d density profile , continuing the task started in @xcite .",
    "the strategy is simple : an arbitrary pre - shock spectrum may be decomposed in its fourier modes and the shock interaction with every single mode is studied separately and superposition is later performed to see the effect on the whole spectrum .",
    "each shock / single mode interaction is assumed to be linear , that is , the initial density fluctuation is assumed to be much lower than the mean background density , a condition satisfied in icf targets .",
    "statistical averages are obtained by integrating over the angles that define the orientation of the pre - shock perturbation wavenumber vector in space , similarly as has been done in refs.@xcite and the works cited there .",
    "we will restrict our results to isotropic pre - shock spectra .",
    "this work is structured as follows : in the following section 2 , the 2d single mode theory is developed , and we show the exact shock dynamics with its corresponding asymptotic expressions . in section 3",
