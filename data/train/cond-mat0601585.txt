    "when a small temperature gradient is applied across a system , the heat current that flows through it is expected to follow fourier s law , @xmath3  @xcite . however , for one - dimensional systems there are numerous  @xcite examples of systems where numerical simulations  @xcite or exact analytical results  @xcite have shown that fourier s law breaks down .",
    "the thermal conductivity @xmath4 is observed to be anomalous , _",
    "i.e.  _ dependent on the system size and divergent in the thermodynamic limit . despite the existence  @xcite of an analytical renormalization group ( rg ) prediction for the behavior of @xmath5",
    "there is still considerable controversy about whether the theory applies to chains of stiff oscillators , where the particles form a lattice to an excellent approximation .",
    "since this is the appropriate description for nanotubes , this class of systems is of great topical interest .",
    "an understanding of @xmath4 also has broader implications , since other transport coefficients can also be anomalous in low dimensional systems  @xcite .",
    "numerical  @xcite and analytical  @xcite studies show @xmath6 for various one - dimensional systems , where @xmath0 is the size of the system and @xmath7 a renormalization group ( rg ) analysis  @xcite has shown that for one - dimensional nonintegrable systems with momentum conservation , @xmath8 has the universal value of @xmath9 and that without momentum conservation the conductivity is normal ( _ i.e. _ @xmath10 ) .",
    "this result was derived using the hydrodynamic equations of a normal fluid .",
    "simulations on one - dimensional hard particle gases have yielded a wide range of values for @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "this is because very large system sizes are needed before the large @xmath0 behavior is reached , presumably because of the limited phase space accessed in one - dimensional elastic collisions .",
    "this problem has been circumvented by using a random collision ( rc ) model  @xcite , where convergence to the asymptotic regime is seen for small @xmath2 recent simulations measuring energy diffusion in hard particle systems have confirmed  @xcite that @xmath11    in marked contrast to these results , chains of nonlinear oscillators such as fermi - pasta - ulam ( fpu ) chains  @xcite and their variants consistently show numerical results that disagree with the rg prediction  @xcite .",
    "varying parameters within a given model gives different values for @xmath8  @xcite , but they generally lie between 0.37 and 0.44  @xcite with occasional exceptions .",
    "this is contrary to the rg prediction , but is compatible with the result from a mode - coupling analysis that yields @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "these numerical results have led to suggestions that there are ( at least ) two universality classes for heat conduction in one - dimensional momentum conserving systems  @xcite , and that thefluid - like \" rg analysis is not appropriate for oscillator chains , which are better described as a crystal with small fluctuations in particle positions .",
    "although any one - dimensional system will _ eventually _ renormalize to fluid like behavior at sufficiently long length scales , for stiff oscillator chains the crystalline order persists to very large @xmath2 since the hydrodynamic equations for a crystal are different from those for a fluid , the large @xmath0 behavior for such chains could be different from the fluid prediction .    in this paper , we show that this is not the case : @xmath8 should be 1/3 even for stiff oscillator chains . in this light , the numerical results on fpu chains are probably due to the well - known difficulties with equilibrating them  @xcite , necessitating extremely large @xmath0 before the asymptotic behavior is seen .    in section",
    "ii , we first argue that the earlier rg analysis  @xcite applies to chains as well as gases .",
    "this result is surprising in view of the fact that the standard hydrodynamic description of crystals introduces extra degrees of freedom for broken symmetries  @xcite , and is peculiar to one - dimensional chains with single - well interparticle interaction potentials .",
    "we then derive the hydrodynamic equations for chains with multiple - well interaction potentials and for quasi one - dimensional systems such as tubes  @xcite .",
    "there are four equations instead of three for a fluid , because of the extra degree of freedom corresponding to the broken symmetry .",
    "we show that these modified hydrodynamic equations also yield @xmath11 in section iii , we elucidate the discrepancy between numerical results on fpu chains and the analytical prediction by performing simulations on fpu chains with collisions , which interpolate continuously between the rc model and pure ( collisionless ) fpu chains .",
    "as we tune parameters to move towards pure fpu chains , a new intermediate length scale regime emerges and increases in range , while leaving the large @xmath0 scaling of @xmath4 unchanged .",
    "this corroborates the analytical prediction that @xmath13 asymptotically . but shows that this will be seen at unusually large @xmath0 for pure fpu chains .",
    "finally , in section iv , we discuss the applicability of these predictions to physical systems .",
    "the rg analysis discussed earlier  @xcite uses the hydrodynamic equations for a one - dimensional fluid  @xcite , @xmath14 & = & \\kappa   \\partial_x^2 t+\\eta [ ( \\partial_x v)^2   + v\\partial_x^2 v ]   \\label{normal}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the local mass , momentum and energy densities respectively .",
    "the thermodynamic fields , temperature , pressure , and velocity are represented by @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 respectively . there are two transport coefficients , the viscosity @xmath21 and the thermal conductivity @xmath4",
    ".    the rg analysis adds noise terms to the second and third of eqs.([normal ] ) ( the first is an exact identity and therefore has no noise term ) . using the green - kubo relations  @xcite , the critical exponents are derived from the equilibrium fluctuations of a system at constant temperature .",
    "this can be done without approximations by invoking galilean invariance and the condition that equal time correlations must obey equilibrium statistical mechanics .    for a crystal ,",
    "broken symmetries introduce additional long - lived hydrodynamic modes  @xcite . for a @xmath22 dimensional crystal ,",
    "the extra @xmath22 broken symmetry degrees of freedom are associated with  @xcite the @xmath23 transverse sound modes , which become propagating instead of diffusing , and an extra vacancy diffusion mode  @xcite .",
    "this vacancy diffusion mode is the only one that survives for @xmath24 the number of hydrodynamic equations is increased from three to four .",
    "we are thus led to enquire whether the results of ref .",
    "@xcite are altered for a stiff chain , which can be viewed as a one - dimensional crystal .    before doing this",
    ", we show that for one - dimensional monoatomic systems , if the interparticle interaction has only one minimum , vacancies do not exist . the fluid description of ref .",
    "@xcite is therefore valid even if the interactions are sufficiently stiff that the particles are almost on a perfect lattice .",
    "this is true for fpu chains .",
    "this result can be shown on physical grounds : if we remove a single particle from an otherwise perfect @xmath22 dimensional crystal , there is a slight distortion in its vicinity , but a vacancy remains .",
    "this vacancy only moves when a neighboring particle hops into the empty site , resulting in very slow diffusive motion of vacancies ( and interstitials ) through the system .",
    "in contrast , if a particle is removed from a fpu - like one - dimensional chain , its neighbors move immediately , on microscopic _i.e .  _ non - hydrodynamic",
    " time scales to close the gap .",
    "although the reduction in mass density caused by removing the particle is not eliminated , but only smeared out , this is what one would expect , since mass density is conserved in eqs.([normal ] ) .",
    "the extra degree of freedom introduced in the standard hydrodynamic treatment of crystals  @xcite , distortions of the broken symmetry , is thus indistinguishable from density fluctuations , and the fluid description of eqs.([normal ] ) remains valid .",
    "there are two ways in which the argument of the previous paragraph can break down .",
    "first , if the interparticle potential has multiple minima , it is possible to create a situation where the separation between adjacent particles is @xmath25 for some @xmath26 and the force on all the particles is zero . here",
    "@xmath27 is the lattice constant and @xmath28 is the separation between minima of the interparticle potential , in the simplest case equal to @xmath27 .",
    "the resulting vacancy at site @xmath29 will diffuse slowly through the system and is therefore a hydrodynamic mode , distinct from lattice distortions and momentum which combine to produce longitudinal sound .",
    "second , if the system is only quasi one - dimensional , for example a cylinder , vacancies can be introduced as for @xmath30 neither of these exceptions applies to fpu chains .",
    "the second exception is , however , applicable to nanotubes . in view of their importance , we derive the hydrodynamic equations for a one - dimensional crystal , modifying eqs.([normal ] ) , and show that the heat conductivity exponent @xmath8 is _ still _ not changed .",
    "this is because the assumptions that allowed @xmath8 to be calculated exactly for a fluid are still valid for the crystal .",
    "( nanotubes have additional transverse and torsional degrees of freedom , but we will argue later that these do not affect @xmath8 either . )    a hydrodynamic theory is formed from the continuity equation of the conserved quantities and the time derivative of all the broken symmetries . in the case of the 1-d crystal ,",
    "the equations are @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the displacment and the currents , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 , are still to be determined .",
    "galilean invariance demands the inclusion of the @xmath20 in the last equation .",
    "following the methods from  @xcite and  @xcite , constitutive equations can be derived from entropy arguments . the first law of thermodynamics for this sytem can be rewritten in terms of densities , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the entropy density and @xmath38 is the chemical potential per unit mass .",
    "a uniform translation can not alter the energy , therefore energy can only depend on gradients of @xmath32 . the conjugate field to @xmath39",
    "is @xmath40 at constant @xmath41 and @xmath16 .",
    "the displacement variable also changes the pressure to @xmath42 using these two relations and the continuity equations , we can derive an entropy `` continuity '' equation with source terms , @xmath43 = -\\frac{q}{t}\\partial_x t   -(g-\\rho v)\\partial_x \\mu \\nonumber\\\\ + ( j^u+v\\partial_x u)\\partial_x h-(\\pi+h - p - gv)\\partial_x v , \\label{entropydensity } \\\\ q = j^{\\epsilon}-\\mu(g-\\rho v)-\\pi v + hj^u - \\epsilon v +   gv^2+hv\\partial_x u.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by integrating both sides of eq.([entropydensity ] ) over a large volume where the entropy `` current '' @xmath44 is negligible at the surface , we have an expression for the time derivative of the total entropy , @xmath45 . \\label{entropy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the constitutive equations for the currents can now be derived by using the condition of entropy creation , @xmath46  @xcite .",
    "the equality holds only when there is no dissipation . without dissipation , each term of eq.([entropy ] ) must independently be zero , giving the reactive terms of the currents : @xmath47 the @xmath48 term in the displacement current does not appear in the derivation of crystal hydrodynamics from  @xcite but appears to us to be correct . with dissipation , entropy is produced and the currents have dissipative components : @xmath49 the transport coefficients @xmath50 and @xmath51 are all positive . in general , there are higher order terms in the gradient expansion , but we will only retain these first order terms ( which is valid for small gradients ) .",
    "the mass current @xmath16 , does not have a dissipative term because it is a conserved density itself .",
    "the displacement field introduces two new transport coefficents : one associated to the relaxation of its conjugate field @xmath52 and the second due to the possibility of cross coupling between the heat current and the displacement field ( and the displacement current and temperature field ) .",
    "this cross coupling is possible because the field and the current have opposite signs under time - reversal , a necessary condition for dissipative currents  @xcite .",
    "for this reason , there are no cross couplings with @xmath33 .",
    "using these expressions for the currents in the continuity equations closes our set of equations , @xmath53 = \\kappa   \\partial_x^2 t+\\eta [ ( \\partial_x v)^2   + v\\partial_x^2 v ] \\nonumber\\\\ + \\gamma [ ( \\partial_x h)^2+h\\partial_x^2 h ]   + \\lambda[t\\partial_x^2h - h\\partial_x^2t]+\\zeta_{\\epsilon } , \\nonumber \\\\ \\partial_t u + ( \\partial_xu-1)v = \\gamma\\partial_x h   - \\lambda\\partial_x t+\\zeta_u . \\label{dyneq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] eqs.([dyneq ] ) are the full nonlinear hydrodynamic equations of the 1-d crystal .",
    "noise , represented by the @xmath54 s , is introduced to the last three equations for the rg analysis .",
    "the hydrodynamic modes and their dispersion relations can be solved for the linearized theory .",
    "the three variable normal fluid has three modes , a heat diffusion mode and two propagating sound modes  @xcite .",
    "the additional displacement variable now introduces another diffusive mode representing vacancy diffusion .",
    "a vacancy diffusion mode is seen in the longitudinal hydrodynamics of the three dimensional crystal as well  @xcite . in these linearized theories ,",
    "quantities such as the susceptibilities and correlations can be calculated and green - kubo relations can be derived  @xcite .",
    "although the details of such calculations are different with four hydrodynamic modes instead of three , eqs.([dyneq ] ) are clearly still galilean invariant , and  when no temperature gradient is imposed externally  have equal time fluctuations that are drawn from the canonical ensemble . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , the various critical exponents are therefore determined and , in particular , @xmath11    in summary , for one - dimensional momentum - conserving crystals ( that reach local thermal equilibrium ) , eqs.([normal ] ) describe the hydrodynamics when vacancies are not possible , as is the case for fpu chains",
    ". when vacancies are possible , eqs.([dyneq ] ) apply , but the symmetry arguments that determine @xmath13 for eqs.([normal ] ) are still valid . in the next section ,",
    "we numerically show the possible source of the discrepancy between prior numerical results on fpu - like lattices  @xcite and this exact result .",
    "results of past numerical simulations  @xcite consistently measure an exponent larger than @xmath55 for fpu - like chains . due to the exact derivation of the analytical prediction , the good agreement between this prediction and gas simulations  @xcite , and the well - known problems of convergence in one - dimensional systems  @xcite",
    ", we conjecture that the fpu simulations have not reached the asymptotic large @xmath0 regime .",
    "going to larger and larger system sizes to confirm this would be prohibitive .",
    "instead , we use a _",
    "tunable _ model which smoothly interpolates between the rc gas and the fpu chain , where this is easier to see .",
    "we introduce fpu - like springs to the random collision model .",
    "as the springs become stiffer , the system continuously evolves from the pure rc gas with @xmath13 to the collisionless fpu chain : from a fluid to a `` crystal '' .",
    "as the spring constants are increased , we observe that an intermediate length scale regime emerges , whereas the large @xmath0 scaling of @xmath4 remains @xmath56 .    for the simulations , we numerically integrate a system of @xmath0 particles with nearest neighbor interactions .",
    "the interaction potential between every pair of particles is of the generalized fpu form @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the compression ( or elongation ) of the spring and @xmath59 is the deviation from the equilibrium position of the @xmath60 particle .",
    "collisions can be neglected in the limit when the lattice constant @xmath27 is large , but for finite @xmath27 and finite temperature , the probability of two particles colliding is nonzero .",
    "when two particles come into contact , @xmath61 , they undergo a random collision as in ref .",
    "@xcite .    for the simulations , we only use terms up to fourth order in eq.([potential ] ) . in their original work , fermi , pasta , and ulam",
    "@xcite noticed that the odd frequency normal modes do not mix with the even frequency normal modes when the interparticle potential is even . to avoid this problem and any others that may arise from this accidental symmetry of an fpu-@xmath62 chain",
    ", we use a finite @xmath63 in all of our chain simulations .",
    "heat baths are connected to the end particles to maintain a temperature gradient across the system .",
    "the scaling of the conductivity is determined by measuring the size dependence of the current maintaining a ( small ) temperature difference between the baths . for our numerics ,",
    "the leftmost ( @xmath64 ) and rightmost ( @xmath65 ) particles are connected to nose - hoover heat baths  @xcite .",
    "the auxiliary degree of freedom introduced in the rc model , the transverse momentum , does not couple to the baths or enter the dynamics except in collisions , and so is not seen in the pure fpu ( collisionless ) limit .",
    "we adopt a convention in which the energy contained in each spring is symmetrically shared by the two particles attached to it .",
    "the first and last springs are only attached to one particle and a wall , therefore their entire energy is attributed to the attached particle . using this convention for the energy density ,",
    "the energy current consists of two parts .",
    "the first is an advective part , @xmath66 .",
    "the second is piecewise constant and jumps at each particle with @xmath67 . from this , @xmath68 , with @xmath69 and @xmath70",
    "equal to the energy currents from the reservoirs to the end particles .",
    "thus the total current flowing through the system is @xmath71 it is possible to show that the time average @xmath72 is equal to @xmath73 .",
    "however , with collisions it is more useful to keep eq.([curr ] ) in its entirety , since @xmath74 at collisions , where @xmath75 is singular .",
    "in fact , for hard sphere particles , @xmath76 .",
    "numerical integration of this system is complicated by the combination of collisions and springs . without springs ,",
    "the particles travel freely and a fast event driven simulation can be implemented  @xcite . for a collisionless system",
    ", the equations of motion can simply be integrated numerically by standard algorithms . for our simulations ,",
    "the fourth order runge - kutta algorithm is used . because of the occurrence of collisions , our algorithm checks for collisions after every trial timestep . if a collision is seen to have occurred , the trial step is discarded , and the integrator evolves the system by a smaller stepsize to the ( extrapolated ) point at which the two particles collide .",
    "because of the need for trial steps , integrating systems with collisions and springs requires substantial amounts of computational time .",
    "we use a stepsize of @xmath77 for all simulations and check that the results do not change for smaller stepsizes .",
    "we allow the system to equilibrate for @xmath78 steps before measurements are taken .",
    "each measurement consists of the particle and time averaged current , where a block of @xmath79 timesteps is used for the time average and @xmath80 steps separate each block .",
    "each data point in figure  [ crossover ] is the mean of many such measurements and the error bars shown are the root mean square errors of the block measurements .",
    "the parameters in the model are the masses of the particles @xmath81 , the lattice constant @xmath27 , the temperatures of the baths @xmath82 and @xmath83 , and the spring constants @xmath84 in eq.([potential ] ) .",
    "alternating masses are used due to the fast convergence seen in the pure rc model for such systems  @xcite . in particular",
    ", we use a mass ratio of 2.62 and @xmath85 for all odd @xmath86 .",
    "the bath temperatures are 1.2 and 1.0 for the left and right baths , respectively .",
    "for these temperatures , we have checked that the system is in the linear response regime . with the temperatures of the baths and the masses of the particles fixed at these values ,",
    "the collision rate can be altered by changing the lattice constant and/or spring constants .",
    "we have chosen to fix the lattice constant to @xmath87 .",
    "figure  [ temperature ] shows the kinetic temperature profile after steady state is reached for systems of size @xmath88 showing increasing curvature as collisions decrease .",
    "for the pure fpu system , the masses of all the particles are chosen to be the same .",
    "this is because with alternating masses , the kinetic temperature for particles in the pure fpu chain also shows an odd - even oscillation , indicating that equilibrating the system with nose - hoover baths is problematic .",
    "all other systems simulated have alternating masses ; as mentioned in the previous paragraph , this allows the large @xmath0 limit to be reached faster .",
    "we verify that the temperature profiles for these do not oscillate , as shown in figure  [ temperature ] .",

    "figure  [ crossover ] shows a log - log plot of the current times the number of particles @xmath91 versus @xmath92 the slope of the plot determines @xmath93     versus @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the time - averaged heat current and @xmath0 is the number of particles , for systems with different spring strengths .",
    "the spring constants @xmath89 of eq.([potential ] ) are specified in the key .",
    "the figure also shows a collisionless fpu chain at the top for comparison .",
    "the systems without springs or weak springs have slopes of @xmath96 at large @xmath0 .",
    "the slope increases with spring strength and is @xmath97 for the pure fpu system at the largest @xmath0 shown .",
    "when shown , the error bars are root mean square errors .",
    "the plots are shifted for clarity.,width=312 ]    for no springs , the pure rc model has a slope of @xmath96 , similar to the earlier results in  @xcite .",
    "this asymptotic value is reached for relatively small systems ( @xmath98 ) . as the springs are turned on",
    ", an intermediate length scale regime emerges and the asymptotic large @xmath0 regime moves out , but the slope in the large @xmath0 regime is _ still _",
    "@xmath99 for the strongest springs shown in figure  [ crossover ] , the asymptotic regime has moved out of the range simulated .",
    "figure  [ crossover ] also shows the results for a pure fpu chain , which agrees with earlier results  @xcite .",
    "the slope of @xmath97 for this system is comparable to the strong spring system with collisions , supporting the assertion that this is an intermediate length scale phenomenon . as discussed in the previous paragraph , the masses of all the particles in the pure fpu chain are chosen to be equal .",
    "this is the cause for the different behavior for very small @xmath94 where the slope increases with @xmath0 instead of decreasing .",
    "in the light of the experience with hard particle gases and the random collision model , it is natural to expect that introducing extra degrees of freedom would cause fpu chains to show their large @xmath0 behavior more rapidly . in this context ,",
    "wang and li  @xcite have shown that when one transverse degree of freedom is added to the fpu chain , the conductivity exponent is numerically seen to be 1/3 .",
    "it would be interesting to see whether other extensions of the fpu model can achieve the same result .",
    "more ambitiously , it would be very useful if a criterion could be obtained that would easily determine numerically whether a system reaches local thermal equilibrium , allowing one to decide whether the hydrodynamic theory is applicable .",
    "the study of low dimensional transport is not merely of theoretical interest ; the vast potential applications of real quasi one - dimensional systems , namely nanotubes , demand an understanding of their physical properties . specifically ,",
    "research and production of electronic devices at the micrometer and nanometer scale have shown that carbon nanotubes may be used in very efficient cooling systems  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the thermal conductivity of nanotubes has been found to be extremely high  @xcite which makes nanotubes obvious candidates for cooling devices in microelectronics . this potential for applications motivates a theoretical investigation of the heat transport properties of low dimensional systems .",
    "experimental  @xcite and numerical  @xcite studies of nanotubes have shown that the phonon contribution to heat transport is much larger than the electronic contribution , so that the fact that we have only considered lattice motion in this paper is not a problem .",
    "the two dimensional nature of the tube allows for the existence of vacancies .",
    "the tubular shape also introduces other transverse hydrodynamic modes ( a broken symmetry and conserved momentum for torsional and the two transverse motions ) , but as mentioned earlier , these modes do not affect the symmetry arguments , and the heat conductivity exponent is expected to still be 1/3 .",
    "the longitudinal hydrodynamics for this quasi one - dimensional system is the four component theory , eqs.([dyneq ] ) .",
    "there are a few concerns in applying the prediction of @xmath100 first , on short length scales , the phonon motion is ballistic .",
    "the phonon mean free path in carbon nanotubes is @xmath101  @xcite , and our discussion in this paper would apply to systems that are larger than this scale .",
    "recent thermal conductivity measurements have only been made on systems with lengths in this order of magnitude  @xcite .",
    "the unusually high conductivity in such systems is correctly attributed to the ballistic transport nature at these scales  @xcite .",
    "there have yet to be extensive experiments on the length dependence of @xmath4 to our knowledge . to test our prediction and measure the actual heat conductivity exponent , length dependent experiments of long ( @xmath102 ) nanotubes must be done .",
    "second , even beyond this length scale it is possible ( based on what we have seen for fpu chains ) that equilibration is imperfect .",
    "however , this is less likely to be a problem with the extra transverse modes  @xcite which are present in a nanotube , and in any case , would only change @xmath8 slightly .",
    "third , under renormalization , the system flows to its fixed point only for large @xmath2 it is not clear what limitation this imposes , but the nonlinearity in the hydrodynamic equations that causes anomalous scaling behavior is the advective term , whose strength is unity and whose effect should therefore be seen even for small system sizes  @xcite .    in this paper , we have shown analytically that one - dimensional chains of particles connected with nonlinear springs have a heat conductivity that diverges as a function of the chain length @xmath0 as @xmath103 which is the same as the earlier result for hard sphere particles and other fluid systems .",
    "for quasi one - dimensional systems , this result is obtained from the crystalline hydrodynamic equations .",
    "it does _ not _ rely on the eventual crossover from a crystal to a fluid which must happen for any one - dimensional system . for fermi - pasta - ulam chains and other examples where the interparticle potential has a single minimum , we have obtained the stronger result",
    "that the fluid hydrodynamic theory  @xcite is applicable on all length scales for the dynamics , even when there is excellent static ordering . in the light of these analytical results , the numerical results on fpu chains that show a heat conductivity exponent of @xmath104 is probably due to imperfect equilibration .",
