    "as the instrumentation for millimeter - wave telescopes improves , it becomes progressively more straightforward to study individual molecular clouds in other galaxies .",
    "recent studies of local group galaxies have surveyed large numbers of molecular clouds in the large magellanic cloud @xcite , the small magellanic cloud @xcite , m33 @xcite , and a bevy of local group dwarf galaxies ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these recent studies explore the nature of star formation on galactic scales by studying the properties of giant molecular clouds ( gmcs , @xmath1 ) throughout their host galaxies .",
    "such gmcs contain the majority of the molecular mass in the milky way s ism and are responsible for most of the star formation in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "the andromeda galaxy ( m31 ) is the second largest disk galaxy in the local group , after the milky way , and it subtends over 2 deg@xmath2 on the sky .",
    "its proximity ( 770 kpc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) makes it an excellent target for studying extragalactic molecular clouds .",
    "numerous surveys of co emission have been conducted over a portion of m31 and a comprehensive list of the 24 co studies published up to 1999 is given in @xcite .",
    "this extensive list of surveys can be supplemented with a few major studies that have occurred since then .",
    "@xcite used the bima millimeter interferometer to study a @xmath3 field in the outer region of the galaxy ( @xmath4  kpc ) and find 6 molecular complexes similar to those found in the milky way .",
    "an extensive survey covering the entirety of the star - forming disk of m31 has been completed using the iram 30-m by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also references therein ) .",
    "finally , @xcite used the plateau de burre interferometer to examine the properties of molecular clouds in 9 fields . using the gaussclumps @xcite algorithm",
    ", they decompose the emission into 30 individual molecular clouds .",
    "previous high - resolution observations of co in m31 indicate that a large fraction of the molecular gas is found in gmcs .",
    "identifying individual gmcs requires a telescope beam with a projected size @xmath5 pc , the typical size of a gmc in the milky way @xcite , which requires an angular resolution of @xmath6 at the distance of m31 .",
    "there have been seven observational campaigns that observed co @xmath7 emission from m31 at sufficient resolution to distinguish molecular clouds : @xcite . with the exception of @xcite ,",
    "all of these studies have found gmcs with properties similar to those found in the inner milky way and @xcite have argued that the differences observed by @xcite can be attributed to observational errors .",
    "indeed , @xcite presented the first direct observations of gmcs in any external galaxy using interferometric observations .",
    "subsequent studies with interferometers and single - dish telescopes confirmed that most co emission in m31 comes from gmcs and that the gmcs properties were similar to those found in the milky way @xcite .",
    "although the molecular gas in m31 has been extensively studied , there remains a gap connecting the large - scale , single - dish observations and the small - scale , interferometer observations . to address this gap ,",
    "we completed co(@xmath8 ) observations of a large ( 20  kpc@xmath9 region ) along a spiral arm of m31 with high resolution ( @xmath10 pc ) .",
    "we then followed up on these observations using a more extended configuration of the interferometer yielding data with a resolution of @xmath11 pc .",
    "this paper presents the observational data of the both the survey and the follow - up observations (  [ obs ] ) . using only the follow - up data , we present the first results , namely a confirmation of previous studies that find gmcs in m31 are similar to those in the milky way (   [ analysis],[larson - sec ] ) .",
    "notably , this paper utilizes the techniques described in @xcite to correct the observational biases that plague extragalactic co observations , thereby placing derived cloud properties on a common scale that can be rigorously compared with gmc data from other galaxies .",
    "the follow - up observations are also used to examine the velocity gradients and angular momentum of the gmcs , which are then compared to the remainder of gas in the galaxy for insight into the gmc formation problem (  [ spang ] ) .",
    "we conclude the paper by examining the larger galactic environment of m31 to explore connections between the gmcs and the larger ism (  [ environment ] ) .",
    "subsequent work will explore the star formation properties of these gmcs and the formation of such clouds along the spiral arm using the data from the spiral arm survey .",
    "we observed @xmath12co(@xmath8 ) emission from m31 during the spring and fall observing seasons of 2002 with the d and c configurations of the bima millimeter interferometer @xcite .",
    "the observations consisted of an 81-field mosaic using the most compact ( d ) configuration with follow - up observations on seven sub - regions , covering 30 fields at higher resolution ( c array ) .",
    "the d - array survey spans a projected length of 6.7 kpc along a spiral arm in the galaxy .",
    "three of the seven follow - up , c - array fields targeted regions with known co emission from the d - array survey , and the remaining four fields targeted regions with strong co emission in the single - dish observations of @xcite over a range of galactocentric distances .",
    "the locations of the fields are indicated in figure [ fields - m31 ] .",
    "the d - array observations were completed in september and october 2002 over the course of four nights . each night",
    "roughly 20 pointings of the mosaic were observed . during the observations , the fields",
    "were observed for 46 seconds each , making two passes through the mosaic before returning to the phase calibrator ( 0102 + 504 , 2.6 jy ) every 30 minutes .",
    "this cycle was continued through the night , accumulating @xmath13 hours of integration time on m31 per night ( 18 minutes per field ) .",
    "the correlator was configured to span 200 mhz at 500 khz ( 1.3 km s@xmath14 ) resolution , easily encompassing the whole range of velocities expected from the m31 s rotation curve for this region @xcite . at the latitude of the hat creek radio observatory , m31 transits near zenith and can not be observed for 40 minutes a night .",
    "this time was used to perform flux calibrations using saturn and uranus .",
    "over the course of the observations , the derived flux of the phase calibrator was stable to 10% .",
    "the relative flux calibration of the data may be better than this level owing to the intrinsic variability of the phase calibrator .",
    "the data were reduced and inverted using the miriad software package @xcite , following the calibration procedures of the bima survey of nearby galaxies @xcite .",
    "the four nights of @xmath15 data were combined using a linear mosaicing technique .",
    "the inversion used natural weighting , and gridding in the @xmath15 plane was chosen to produce maps with @xmath16 pixels and @xmath17  km  s@xmath14 channel width .",
    "the dirty maps were deconvolved with a steer - dewey - ito deconvolution algorithm optimized for mosaics ( mossdi2 in the miriad software package ) .",
    "each plane of the final image was cleaned to the 1.5@xmath18 significance level .",
    "the final resolution of the survey is @xmath6 , with negligible variation over the map .",
    "the mosaic is corrected for the gain of the primary beam .",
    "three regions within the d - array survey containing emission were observed with the more extended c - array configuration . in total , 26 fields were observed on five nights from october to december 2002 .",
    "the c - array observations used the same observing strategy as the low - resolution survey , observing each field for 46 seconds and making two or three passes ( depending on the size of the mosaic ) through the mosaic before observing the phase calibrator every 24 minutes .",
    "the correlator configuration and choice of calibrators were the same as for the survey .",
    "the follow - up observations used a subset of the d - array pointing centers to facilitate merging the two data sets .",
    "these data were combined with the d - array observations in the @xmath15 plane and inverted using uniform weighting .",
    "the data were cleaned using the same steer - dewey - ito deconvolution algorithm as for the d - array map .",
    "the final resolution of the combined data is @xmath19 with a 2.03  km  s@xmath14 channel width .",
    "the images are corrected for the gain of the primary beam .",
    "prior to the d - array survey , four fields of m31 were observed using the c array ( spring 2002 ) .",
    "these observations targeted single fields known to contain bright co emission from @xcite over a range of galactocentric distance .",
    "the fields were chosen to span a variety of regions in the galaxy ( different spiral arms and galactocentric radii ) in an attempt to reveal any biases seen by focusing on one region of the galaxy .",
    "the observations used 0136 + 478 as a phase calibrator and mars to establish the flux scale of the phase calibrator .",
    "since the observations consisted exclusively of c - array data , they were inverted using natural weighting .",
    "the final synthesized beam size for these observations is @xmath20 .",
    "the observations produced one survey data cube and 7 high - resolution data cubes for analysis .",
    "the properties of these data sets are summarized in table [ m31-obsprops ] .",
    "since space constraints prohibit a full presentation of all the observational data , an excerpt from the center of field a is shown in figure [ data - example ] to illustrate typical quality of the data .",
    "the remainder of the paper emphasizes the high - resolution data ( fields a - g in table [ m31-obsprops ] ) .",

    "we generate a noise map by smoothing the resulting pixel estimates with a boxcar kernel of the same size as the synthesized beam .",
    "then , we estimate the relative changes of the noise across the bandpass by estimating @xmath18 in each channel map and normalizing to the mean value of @xmath35 across the bandpass . we generate a cube of noise estimates by scaling the error map by the fractional change from the mean appropriate for that velocity . performing a pixel - wise division of the data cube by the cube of noise estimates",

    "we identify co emission in the data cubes by searching for contiguous regions of high significance in position - position - velocity space using a two - tiered thresholding scheme ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "the core pixels in the mask are identified as pairs of pixels in adjacent velocity channels with @xmath36 .",
    "the mask is then expanded in position and velocity space to include all pixels with @xmath37 that are connected by high significance pixels to the @xmath38 core of the mask .",
    "this masking process has been used in previous extragalactic , interferometric studies and has been shown to successfully identify emission with minimal inclusion of noise @xcite .",
    "eliminating noise from the emission under consideration is key to the methods used to determine cloud properties ( see  [ cloudprops ] ) .",
    "the identification and analysis of gmcs in m31 may be complicated by the relatively high inclination of the galaxy : @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "the situation is similar , in part , to observing gmcs in the outer regions of the milky way ( @xmath40 ! ) , and the spatial resolution ( @xmath11 pc ) is comparable to what is found using small telescopes ( e.g.  the cfa 1.2-m ) to observe distant ( @xmath41  kpc ) gmcs in the milky way @xcite . while study of gmcs has been conducted in the milky way with such data , the inclination being @xmath42 and not @xmath43 helps the situation significantly .",
    "the foreground and background spiral arms in m31 are separated from the arm under consideration by @xmath44 in projection .",
    "thus , spatial information is useful for separating the emission into gmcs .",
    "the clouds in the interarm region are likely too faint to be recovered by the deconvolution algorithm (  [ fluxrec ] ) .",
    "we conclude that the primary concern in decomposition is the blending of gmcs within the same spiral arm .",
    "@xcite estimate that the width of the spiral arms in the plane of the galaxy for this region is @xmath45  pc with a vertical thickness of 150 pc .",
    "there could be multiple , distinct clouds in the spiral arm along the same line of sight , so we make a simple estimate of how many gmcs are likely to be along a line of sight through the spiral arm .",
    "we model the arm as a cylinder with elliptical cross - section having major and minor axes of 500 pc and 150 pc respectively . for a viewing angle 77@xmath46 away from the minor axis of the cylinder , the path length through the cylinder is @xmath47  pc .",
    "we assume that the gmcs are distributed uniformly in the cylindrical volume with volume density @xmath48 and geometric cross - section @xmath49 .",
    "the mean number of clouds intersected by a line - of - sight through the arm is then @xmath50 .",

    ", we can estimate the area filling fraction of gmcs in the arm when viewed from above the galaxy:@xmath58 . since",
    "@xmath59 is also given by @xmath60 , we can express @xmath61 significant confusion will occur for @xmath62 .",
    "for this condition to be met with @xmath63  pc and @xmath64  pc , @xmath65 .",
    "the data of @xcite show @xmath66 for this region requiring gmcs in m31 to have @xmath67 for significant blending to occur .",
    "we regard this possibility as unlikely since gmcs in other , less confused regions of m31 are found to have comparable properties to local group clouds @xcite where @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , one of the aims of the paper is to assess how similar clouds in m31 are to those in other galaxies ; so we can not reject the possibility that the clouds could be significantly blended along the line of sight although this would imply significantly larger sizes and lower column densities than is typical for gmcs in other galaxies .",
    "we conclude this discussion of inclination effects by noting that we will assume that gmc properties are independent of viewing angle , as is common in studies of gmcs in the milky way and beyond ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as a result , the reported properties of gmcs do not need any correction for the high inclination of the galaxy .      we identify emission in the data cubes from the high - resolution data ( fields a - g in table [ m31-obsprops ] ) using the signal - identification method described in  [ m31-masking ] .",
    "maps of the high - resolution data fields appear in figures [ m31-cfield1 ] and [ m31-cfield2 ] .",

    "the rl06 algorithm establishes its parameters from physical scales in the data ( e.g.  parsecs , km  s@xmath14 ) as opposed to observationally determined scales ( beam and channel widths ) to minimize biases in comparing catalogs with different observational properties . for the high - resolution data , the algorithm identifies 67 molecular clouds in the seven cubes .",

    "since interferometers do not measure the total power of observed emission , they must rely upon single dish observations for accurate measurements of the co flux . in the absence of such single - dish data ,",
    "deconvolution algorithms can be used to extrapolate into the unsampled short - spacing area of the @xmath216 plane @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of such extrapolations depends primarily on the signal - to - noise ratio of the data and to a lesser degree on the observational strategy and the structure of the object being observed .",
    "since this work uses flux information to calculate cloud masses as well as in the moments that determine the cloud properties , flux loss affects all stages of this analysis .",
    "we use the data from iram 30-m survey of m31 @xcite to quantify the amount of flux lost in each of the the observations .",
    "we report the fraction of flux in the bima maps relative to that found in the iram map in table [ m31-obsprops ] as the column labeled @xmath217 .",
    "the fractions recovered range from 12% to 42% .",
    "the relatively low fraction of flux recovered is a product of two factors that affect interferometric observations : spatial filtering of gmcs ( studied in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the non - linear recovery of signal in the low signal - to - noise regime ( explored in * ? ? ?",
    "the work of @xcite found that , because of their clumpy structure , spatial filtering did not hinder the accurate measurement of gmc shapes , fluxes and properties .",
    "however , their simulations were conducted in the high signal - to - noise regime . in the low signal - to - noise regime",
    ", @xcite found that even relatively compact simulated sources suffered from significant flux loss , owing to the inability for the deconvolution algorithms to isolate low - amplitude signal .",
    "these two effects ( spatial filtering of gmc emission and low signal - to - noise ) were studied together in rl06 who simulated bima c , d , and c+d observations of milky way gmcs ( orion , rosette , w3/4/5 ) as if those gmcs were located in m31 .",
    "their work showed that accurate recovery of cloud properties required signal - to - noise ratios of @xmath218 for less than a 20% loss in all the cloud properties . for clouds with lower significance ,",
    "the flux loss is more severe .",
    "however , the dominant source of flux loss comes from clouds not detected in the observations at all , i.e. those with @xmath219 , the minimum amplitude to which the deconvolution algorithm operates . for these clouds",
    ", the deconvolution algorithm does not identify a significant local maximum for cleaning and the cloud contributes zero flux to the deconvolved map .",
    "such low mass clouds likely comprise most of the missing flux not seen in the interferometer data .",
    "when clouds are detected , cloud properties estimated from the observations should be relatively accurate , particularly if @xmath220 .",
    "in general , we only consider the properties of clouds in the study if this sensitivity condition is met ; exceptions to this criterion will be noted . for the high - resolution data , 19 gmcs meet the signal - to - noise criterion ( the ` high signal - to - noise clouds ' in table [ m31-cloudprops ] ) .",
    "we emphasize that for these m31 data interferometer observations act as a filter that preferentially detects gmcs , but the properties of those clouds are well - measured .",
    "upon measuring a set of gmc properties for clouds in another galaxy , the immediate question is whether these clouds are similar to those found in the milky way .",
    "ideally , the well - resolved clouds in the milky way would be analyzed using the methods of rl06 so that the results are directly comparable . however , since measuring cloud properties in the inner galaxy requires establishing a single distance by resolving the kinematic distance ambiguity , a detailed re - analysis has not been completed to date . the next best solution is to compare the results to an existing catalog .    for comparison",
    ", we use the catalog of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* s87 ) to define the population of gmcs in the inner milky way .",
    "the work of s87 used similar methods to calculate cloud properties though their work adopts a fundamentally different procedure for segmenting gmcs .",
    "in addition , their cloud properties are not corrected for the effects of sensitivity as are the properties derived in this study .",
    "consequently , there may be systematic differences between their catalog and the present study .",
    "in general , the fluxes , line widths and radii of the s87 clouds will be smaller than would be derived using the methods of rl06 ; however , using interferometer data to observe the extragalactic clouds will reduce the fluxes , line widths and radii by a similar amount ( rl06 ) .",
    "we have rescaled the catalog of s87 to a different galactocentric solar radius : @xmath221  kpc to @xmath222  kpc and the co - to - h@xmath199 conversion factor adopted in this study .",
    "we also recalculated cloud sizes using the definition of rl06 .",
    "finally , it is noteworthy that the method of rl06 reports , in addition to unbiased values for the cloud properties , appropriate uncertainties for those properties facilitating a statistically based comparison of cloud properties in m31 to those in the milky way .",
    "@xcite first demonstrated that there were power - law scalings among the properties of molecular gas clouds .",
    "that gmcs followed these scalings became well established in a series of surveys and catalogs of the co emitting gas in the inner milky way ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "although there are several algebraically equivalent forms for expressing these relations , the most physically relevant relationships are generally agreed to be : @xmath223 and @xmath224 for the inner milky way ,",
    "@xmath225 km  s@xmath14 and @xmath226 ( s87 ) .",
    "the first relationship is the size - line width relationship and results from the supersonic turbulent motions in the gmcs , as first suggested by @xcite .",
    "the constant @xmath227 in equation [ virial ] is the virial parameter @xcite and since @xmath228 in the inner milky way the clouds are frequently interpreted as being self - gravitating . in figure [ larson ] , we plot these two relationships for the 19 clouds in m31 with sufficient signal to noise that their properties can be well - recovered in interferometric observations . we compare the relationships to those found in the catalog of s87 .    in both the size - line width relationship and the value of the virial parameter ,",
    "there is reasonably good agreement between the gmcs in m31 and the inner milky way gmcs of s87 .",
    "fitting the relationship for the 19 clouds in m31 that meet the sensitivity criterion (  [ fluxrec ] ) using the method of @xcite gives a size - line width relationship of @xmath229 for reference , a fit to the catalog of s87 using the same fitting method , albeit without uncertainties in the cloud properties , gives @xmath230 thus , the size - line width relationship for the molecular clouds is indistinguishable from the clouds found in the inner milky way .",
    "the similarity between size - line width relationship for clouds in m31 and the inner milky way has been reported on several occasions by other authors @xcite , though no previous study has reported an independent fit for the clouds in m31 with well characterized uncertainties in the cloud properties .",
    "the virial parameter for clouds in m31 is constant as a function of luminous mass .",
    "the uncertainty - weighted , mean value of the virial parameter for clouds in m31 is @xmath231 . for the sample of s87 , @xmath232 .",
    "the difference between the virial parameters is not statistically significant .",
    "moreover , any flux loss will affect the luminous mass estimates more than the virial estimate ( rl06 ) , so our measurement of the virial parameter is at worst an upper limit .",
    "it is unlikely that the true virial parameters of m31 cloud population differs significantly from the milky way , provided the co - to - h@xmath199 conversion factor is the same for both systems .",
    "alternatively , by assuming that the molecular clouds cataloged in this study are in the same dynamical state as are clouds in the inner milky way , we can justify our choice of co - to - h@xmath199 conversion factor .",
    "again , the similarity of the virial parameter has been noted by several authors in previous studies @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the latter two studies find no systematic variation in the virial parameter for clouds over a large range of galactocentric radius in m31 .",
    "in addition to macroscopic properties like line width , radius and mass , interferometric observations of extragalactic gmcs can be used to measure the velocity gradients and angular momenta of the clouds .",

    "we determine the velocity gradient by a least - squares fit of a plane to the velocity centroid surface @xmath233  the velocity centroid measured as a function of position across the cloud .",
    "the velocity centroid and its uncertainty are determined from the first moment of velocity weighted by brightness .",
    "the coefficients of the fit determine the magnitude ( @xmath234 ) and position angle ( @xmath235 ) of the velocity gradient for the molecular cloud ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "the results of the fits are listed in table [ m31-cloudprops ] . for purposes of this analysis",
    ", we have included all clouds , since the velocity gradient is less affected by the interferometric effects which bias the macroscopic properties (  [ fluxrec ] ) .",
    "the velocity gradient is derived from line centroids and the first moments ( centroids ) are much less sensitive to the low surface brightness wings of the line than are the second moments .",
    "we do exclude all measurements of the velocity gradient where the uncertainty is larger than 0.15 km  s@xmath14  pc@xmath14 .",
    "this upper limit was chosen from the maximum uncertainty for clouds with high signal - to - noise ( @xmath236 ) , including a total of 44 clouds in this portion of the analysis .",
    "uncertainties in the derived parameters are determined from the errors in the least - squares parameters given the uncertainty in the centroid .",

    "we compare the magnitude of the velocity gradient to the velocity gradient that would be expected from the orbital motion of the gas in the galactic potential , ignoring streaming motions in the spiral arms .",
    "the local galactic velocity is estimated from the tangent plane to a surface defined by the line of sight projection of the galactic rotation velocity .",
    "we use the rotation curve of @xcite which is a compilation of previous co and studies using updated orientation information . on average ,",
    "the rotation gradient of gmcs exceeds the circular galactic gradient by a factor of 3.0 .",
    "we measured the difference between the position angle of the gradient and that of the local galactic gradient expected from circular rotation for each of the clouds . while suggesting a slight alignment with the galaxy , the distribution of this difference is not significantly different from a random distribution according to a two - sided ks test ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath237 ) .",
    "this is similar to the work of @xcite who found a random distribution of position angles in the milky way gmcs but different from rpeb who found significant alignment of the gradients with the galactic rotation .",
    "this analysis has assumed the decomposed data represent discrete clouds with independent velocity fields , and the factor of three difference between the magnitudes of the cloud and local galactic gradients supports that model . however , it is also possible that we are inappropriately decomposing a continuous gas flow into clouds and the large velocity gradients result from the change in the gas flowing into the density wave . in the presence of the radial motions that such a flow implies ,",
    "the local galactic velocity gradient will change in magnitude by a factor of , at most , @xmath238 and in position angle by @xmath239 where @xmath240 and @xmath241 are the radial and azimuthal components of the gas flow . for gas in m31 , @xmath242 @xcite so these changes will not be significant and the factor of three excess of cloud gradient magnitude over the local rotational gradient implies discontinuous velocity fields .",
    "moreover , any changes should be systematic in nature , and the large range of position angles actually observed implies we are measuring the velocity gradients of discrete objects .",
    "while the magnitudes of the velocity gradients of the clouds are larger than the local rotation in the galaxy , the implied angular momentum of the gmcs is significantly smaller than that of an equivalent mass of atomic gas orbiting in the galactic gravitational potential at the gmc s position .",
    "the specific angular momentum for a cloud of gas with velocity gradient magnitude @xmath234 is @xmath243 where @xmath244 for a wide range of density distributions undergoing uniform rotation @xcite .",
    "if the velocity gradient arises solely from the turbulent motions in the cloud , @xmath245 is likely 23 times smaller @xcite .",
    "it is unlikely that the high galactic inclination affects the results .",
    "the near - random distribution of the position angles implies that the cloud angular momentum vectors are similarly close to random which would require scaling the angular momentum up by a factor of @xmath246 on average ( rpeb ) . a turbulent origin for the velocity gradients would not necessitate any correction .",
    "since any correction would be small , we make no correction for the orientation of the clouds .    for the clouds in the velocity gradient analysis ,",
    "the mean angular momentum is @xmath247 pc km s@xmath14 for a solid body rotator and 23 times smaller for the angular momentum of turbulent flows , comparable to the results for other systems ( rpeb , * ? ? ?",

    "we take @xmath252 @xcite , including their estimates of both atomic and molecular material since small molecular clouds seen in co may be progenitor material for the larger gmcs . from the measured masses of gmcs and locations of gmcs , we calculate @xmath250 and the galactic shear from the rotation curve of @xcite . the mean value of @xmath253 for the clouds in the sample . on a cloud by cloud basis ,",
    "the angular momentum of the galactic material is only a factor of 1.7 larger than the that of the gmcs , significantly smaller than the difference found in m33 where @xmath254 .",
    "the smaller margin is primarily due to the lower shear in m31 , reducing @xmath255 by a factor of 4 compared to that found for the clouds in m33 whereas the velocity gradients are comparable in the two systems .",
    "similarly , the cloud properties and gradients for clouds in the milky way are comparable to the clouds in m31 @xcite , but the shear is much larger in the inner milky way compared to the 11-kpc arm of m31 .",
    "consequently , the discrepancy between the angular momentum of progenitor material and the resulting gmcs is also larger in the inner milky way than it is in m31 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the angular momentum defect for the m31 clouds is likely significant : the factor of 1.7 difference should be regarded as a minimum value since attributing the velocity gradients to turbulence or accumulating the progenitor material from a larger range of galactocentric radius will appreciably increase the margin .",
    "these results suggest a broad similarity between gmcs in m31 and the other disk galaxies in the local group .",
    "the primary goal of studying the velocity structure within the gmcs is to relate their angular momentum to that of the ism as a whole to evaluate formation mechanisms .",
    "the angular momentum defect between gmcs and the ism is common among the studied systems ( * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite study the role of magnetic effects at removing angular momentum from forming clouds and conclude that magnetic effects can reduce the angular momentum to observed values .",
    "their unmagnetized simulations show no significant reduction in cloud angular momentum , although the density enhancements that represent proto - gmcs show @xmath256 , similar to the observed _ minimum _ value found in m31 .",
    "the relatively low - shear environment does not necessarily require magnetic braking to produce the observed cloud angular momenta , though our measurement of @xmath257 likely significantly underestimates the true value .",
    "with respect to their macroscopic properties and velocity gradients , gmcs in the 11-kpc , star - forming arm in m31 appears indistinguishable from the molecular clouds in the inner milky way .",
    "as our knowledge of gmcs in other galaxies grows , it becomes more apparent that such detailed agreement in the properties of gmcs is not universal and may actually represent exceptional cases @xcite .",
    "given the differences measured among extragalactic cloud populations , the most pressing question is : what physical mechanisms regulate the observed differences in gmcs properties ? these mechanisms must couple the gmcs to the ism on much larger scales , and future studies will examine the nature of this coupling in more detail .",
    "the similarity between gmcs in m31 and the milky way offers a useful point of reference for studying the relationship between the galactic ism and gmcs . finding environmental properties that vary significantly between the two systems while gmc properties remain the same would imply those properties are irrelevant to the regulation of molecular cloud properties .",
    "several features of the galactic environment are thought to play a role in regulating the structure of the cold ism and the properties of gmcs .",
    "here , we review several of these features and note the degree of similarity to the local milky way :    * _ interstellar radiation field _  the interstellar radiation field in m31 has been previously noted to be poor in the ultraviolet relative to the milky way @xcite , though the m31 field may be significantly enhanced in the star - forming spiral arm imaged in the co observations .",
    "indeed , work by @xcite study [ ] emission in the star forming arms at @xmath258  kpc and note that the far ultraviolet field is consistent with being 100 times the local interstellar value ( i.e. @xmath259 ) around molecular clouds .",
    "thus , the observed fuv deficiency likely does not characterize the molecule rich region of the galaxy and the radiation environment is similar to clouds in the milky way . *",
    "_ metallicity _  the gas phase metallicity from regions in m31 at @xmath260 kpc is approximately [ o / h]-[o / h]@xmath261=0.0 dex with significant scatter , up to @xmath262 0.2 dex @xcite .",
    "the region shows no signs of being significantly enriched or depleted relative to the solar neighborhood . *",
    "_ dynamics _  the toomre @xmath0 parameter is frequently used to evaluate the stability of galactic disks with respect to the formation of self - gravitating structures .",
    "the parameter is defined as @xmath263 where @xmath264 is the epicyclic frequency , @xmath265 is the one - dimensional gas velocity dispersion and @xmath266 the surface density of the gas in the disk .",
    "most star - forming regions of galactic disks show @xmath267 @xcite and this region of m31 is no exception . for the rotation curve of @xcite , @xmath268 .",
    "we take @xmath269 @xcite .",
    "finally , we take @xmath270 from @xcite . combining these data",
    "give @xmath271 , well within the range of values observed in most galaxies and approximately the same value found in the solar neighborhood . * _ midplane density _",
    " we can also compare the midplane particle density of this region in m31 to the solar neighborhood .",
    "the mean particle density is important for regulating thermal structure of the ism and the formation of the cold medium @xcite .",
    "adopting a gas scale height of 340 pc for this region of m31 @xcite gives @xmath272 in the spiral arm region , but falling to @xmath273 outside the arm .",
    "these densities are smaller than that found in the solar neighborhood ( @xmath274 , * ? ? ?",
    "the properties of the ism in this region of m31 appear , at least superficially , similar to those found in the solar neighborhood .",
    "hence , the derived similarity of molecular clouds in the two galaxies is not surprising .",
    "the only property that appears like it may be significantly different between the two environments is the midplane particle density in the neutral medium .",
    "if the difference is significant , the constancy of the gmc properties suggests that the particle density may be important in regulating the fraction of material found in the cold , neutral ism but perhaps not the properties of individual gmcs . while this environmental similarity does not isolate any irrelevant physical processes , noting the similarity in both clouds and environments illustrates that similar galactic environments do indeed produce similar gmcs",

    "we measured the velocity gradients and angular momenta across the gmcs . like the milky way and m33",
