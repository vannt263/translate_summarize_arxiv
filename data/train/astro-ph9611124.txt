    "there are more than 100 giant molecular clouds in the galaxy with mass of 10@xmath11m@xmath12 or greater .",
    "the internal velocity dispersion of these clouds , measured using @xmath3co emission , is in most cases approximately equal to their virial velocity of about 15  ( dame 1986 ) .",
    "however , there are at least two very unusual molecular clouds , located at @xmath13(@xmath14 ) and ( @xmath15 ) , which have extremely large velocity dispersions of about 100  ( fwhm ) as seen in several molecular lines including @xmath3co",
    ". hereafter we shall refer to these objects as wide line clouds ( wlcs ) .",
    "oort drew attention to the large velocity dispersion of the wlc at @xmath16 longitude in his influential review article almost two decades ago ( 1977 ) .",
    "however , these clouds remained largely unexplored until the mid - eighties when stark and bania ( 1986 ) and bitran ( 1987 ) mapped them at high spatial resolution in @xmath3co , @xmath17co , and cs , and confirmed their unusually large velocity dispersion .",
    "the observed velocity dispersion even in cs , which is associated with high density cores of clouds , is about @xmath18  compared to @xmath19@xmath20  for giant molecular clouds .",
    "both clouds are also visible in the large - scale oh absorption - line survey of boyce and cohen ( 1994a ) where the properties of seven wlcs are discussed in the longitude range @xmath21 . for",
    "an overall @xmath10@xmath22 map of this galactic centre region see boyce and cohen ( 1994b ) .",
    "in addition , the same authors have mapped the cloud at @xmath23 using @xmath24 measurements and give a mass estimate of @xmath25 ( boyce _ et al .",
    "_ 1989 ) .",
    "according to bitran ( 1987 ) and stark and bania ( 1986 ) the mass of the clouds , estimated from the @xmath3co emission , is about @xmath26 , however , this is very uncertain because the ratio of h@xmath27 mass to co emission for clouds in the inner few kpc is likely to be different from the solar neighborhood ( stacy 1988 ) .",
    "we have mapped the two wlcs in @xmath28-cm in order to provide a lower limit to their mass , to determine their velocity dispersion , and to ascertain if they are different from giant molecular clouds .    in the next section",
    "we describe the observational details , sect .",
    "3 contains the results and a comparison with the co - observations .",
    "the main results are summarized in sect .  4 .",
    "we have observed the two wide - line clouds in @xmath28-cm with the effelsberg @xmath29  m telescope using a cooled hemt receiver with a system temperature less than about @xmath30  k on cold sky but increased to about @xmath31  k due to radio emission from the galactic centre and spillover from the ground .",
    "the total bandwith of the receiver was @xmath32  mhz around the neutral hydrogen hyperfine transition frequency of @xmath33  mhz ; the corresponding velocity range was @xmath34 to @xmath35  . using the @xmath36 channel autocorrelation spectrometer a resolution of about @xmath37",
    "was obtained after hanning filtering of the spectra .",
    "the clouds have been mapped in steps of @xmath38 which is half the beam width of the telescope . the total angular coverage in @xmath10 and @xmath22 for the two clouds were ( @xmath39)(@xmath40 ) and ( @xmath41)(@xmath42 ) , respectively .",
    "thus each cloud was scanned at @xmath43 observation points with an integration time of @xmath44  s per position .",
    "the temperature was calibrated by periodically switching to a stabilized noise tube , and the calibration of the noise tube was done by observing the standard area s7 before and after mapping each cloud .",
    "the resulting temperature calibration factors are used to convert the measured voltage to brightness temperature including atmospheric extinction . for both clouds the rms noise level in the raw data was about @xmath45  mk .",
    "we did not however correct the maps for effects from the antenna side lobes ; the resulting error is expected to be small ( the relative sensitivity of the first side lobes , separated from the main beam by @xmath46 , is about @xmath47 ) .    at low velocities the observed spectra",
    "are dominated by strong emission from foreground material .",
    "the wlcs can be seen as broad emission structures extending up to @xmath48  . at both ends of the observed velocity interval",
    "no neutral hydrogen emission was detected , and we have used these emission free regions to subtract a linear baseline from each spectrum with a baseline error of about @xmath49  k.",
    "in fig .  1 we show average @xmath28-cm spectra of the clouds , i.e. the brightness temperature averaged over the observed area .",
    "for the wlc at @xmath50 this average contains three distinct peaks .",
    "the first one at @xmath51  is caused by the emission from the wlc itself , the second one at @xmath52  is partly from the wlc and also contains a strong contribution from an arm - like structure at @xmath53 which extends over the entire observed @xmath10-range ( compare fig .",
    "the high velocity peak at @xmath54  is entirely due to hi near the galactic center unrelated to the wlc .    in the composite hi spectra of the wlc at @xmath55 ( fig .",
    "1 ) two peaks can be seen .",
    "the one at @xmath56  is probably unrelated to the wlc .",
    "the strong peak at @xmath57  is again due to a extended arm - like structure which is however more uniformly distributed over the observed area with a strong contribution from emission at @xmath58 .",
    "this wlc is weaker than the wlc at @xmath50 and is harder to recognize in the average spectrum .",
    "2 shows @xmath10-@xmath59-maps for both of the observed regions .",
    "the wlcs are clearly seen and appear to cover a large velocity range of more than @xmath29  .",
    "it is a remarkable fact that in both cases the clouds end at high velocity ridges extending over the entire observed longitude range .",
    "these ridges can also be identified in the corresponding co - maps , although the ratio of intensities between the clouds and the ridges are much larger in co compared to hi , i.e. the ridges appear much weaker in co.    contour maps of the temperature integrated over the velocity range from @xmath60  to @xmath61  as a function of @xmath10 and @xmath22 are shown in fig",
    ".  3 for both wlcs in 21-cm as well as @xmath3co emission . both wlcs clearly stand out against the background , and their positions , sizes , and orientations obtained in hi coincide with the @xmath62 emission ; it is evident that we are looking at the same objects in both of these lines .",
    "there is a small offset of about @xmath63  arcmin between the centers of the hi- and the @xmath62-map for the wlc at @xmath64 .",
    "this is however insignificant since the shift is much less than the beam width for both observations .",
    "it can also be seen that the wlc at @xmath7 is partly obscured by the hi - emission from the galactic plane but stands out more strongly in @xmath62 .",
    "the wlcs are almost certainly not nearby objects .",
    "the reason for this is that the observed velocity range of the wlcs seen in @xmath28-cm , as well as @xmath3co , is approximately 0200 km s@xmath9 , with a mean velocity of about 100 km s@xmath9 .",
    "thus if these clouds were nearby objects on roughly circular orbit , then their orbital velocity projected along the line of sight would be small and therefore their observed internal random velocity should have comparable negative and positive values .",
    "this is contrary to the observations .",
    "the observed velocity of an object , on a circular orbit , in the galactic plane at longitude @xmath10 is @xmath65\\sin\\ell\\ ] ] where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the distances of the observer and the object from the galactic center , respectively , and @xmath68 is the angular rotation speed . taking @xmath69 to be approximately constant",
    "we find the distance of the wlc at @xmath64 from the galactic center to be @xmath70 , and the one at @xmath71 to be @xmath72 .",
    "thus the distance @xmath73 of the wlcs from us is approximately @xmath66 .",
    "the total neutral hydrogen mass of the wlcs is estimated from the observed flux in @xmath28-cm using the formula    @xmath74    where @xmath75 is brightness temperature in k , @xmath59 is the velocity in , and @xmath10 and @xmath22 are measured in degrees .",
    "this expression follows from the number of hydrogen atoms along the line of sight as given by burton ( 1988 ) multiplied with the atomic hydrogen mass and the suface element @xmath76 .    substituting the observed quantities in the above equation we find that the hi mass in the cloud regions , i.e. without subtracting any background emission , are about @xmath77 for the @xmath50 cloud , and @xmath78 for the cloud at @xmath7 .",
    "these values were obtained by integrating the brightness temperature over the velocity range of 50200  @xmath79 in order to eliminate most of emission from foreground hi .",
    "however , there is a substantial @xmath28-cm emission in this velocity range associated with the galactic plane at the angular location of both of the wlcs that must also be subtracted in order to determine the atomic mass of these clouds .",
    "we have tried several different ways of estimating this _ background _ emission .",
    "one method is to calculate the total hi emission outside the region occupied by each cloud , and multiply it by the fractional area covered by the cloud to yield the contribution of the background emission .",
    "this procedure gives the _ corrected _ hi mass of the wlc at @xmath16 to be @xmath80 , and the wlc at @xmath81 to be about @xmath82 .",
    "however , this method overestimates the _ background _ contribution , or underestimates cloud mass , since the emission from outside the cloud region is very nonuniform and is dominated by the strong @xmath28-cm emission from the galactic plane .",
    "we have also subtracted average spectra from the cloud region before calculating the mass from the integral of equation ( 1 ) ; various areas outside the clouds were used to determine the average spectra .",
    "when the galactic plane is not included in the area that is used in estimating the average spectra , then we obtain cloud mass that are approximately the averages of the two extreme values mentioned above , and is likely to be closer to the actual atomic mass of these clouds which lie outside of the galactic plane .",
    "our best estimate of the hi mass of the wlc at @xmath16 is @xmath83 , and the wlc at @xmath81 is @xmath84 with an uncertainty of about a factor of 2 .",
    "the hi mass is obviously the lower limit to the total cloud mass , most of which is molecular hydrogen .",
    "neutral hydrogen in a typical giant molecular clouds is observed in a halo surrounding the cloud , with a ratio of hi to molecular mass of roughly 10% ( e.g. anderson , wannier & morris 1991 , elmegreen & elmegreen 1987 ) .",
    "the neutral hydrogen mass of the wlcs is about 1% of their total mass as determined from the @xmath3co emission ( bitran 1987 ) .",
    "it has been suggested that the ratio of h@xmath27 mass to @xmath3co emission for clouds near the galactic center is perhaps smaller by a factor of about 10 compared to the value in the solar neighborhood ( see stacy 1988 ) .",
    "we also expect to see a larger fraction of the @xmath3co molecules in these clouds because of their large velocity dispersion . taking these factors into consideration",
    "we conclude that the ratio of the hi mass to the total mass for the wlcs is not very different from giant molecular clouds .",
    "we have mapped two molecular clouds at @xmath50 and @xmath7 in the @xmath28-cm line emission of neutral hydrogen .",
    "these clouds show unusually large velocity dispersions of more than @xmath29  ( fwhm ) which has also been seen in lines of @xmath62 , @xmath4 , and @xmath85 .",
    "the position , size , and orientation of both of the wide line clouds ( wlcs ) are the same in hi and @xmath3co maps .",
    "the wlcs are very prominent features in the @xmath10-@xmath59-maps and show up as highly extended vertical bands .",
    "these clouds lie about 0.3@xmath86 from the galactic plane and are almost certainly within about 1 kpc of the galactic center .",
    "the mass of the clouds calculated from their @xmath62 emission , using the standard ratio of h@xmath27 to @xmath3co mass , is about @xmath87 ( bitran 1987 ) ; however for clouds in the galactic center region the ratio of h@xmath27 mass to @xmath3co luminosity is perhaps smaller by a factor of about 10 compared to the value in the solar neighborhood . from our hi observation",
    "we estimate the atomic mass of the wlcs at @xmath50 and @xmath81 to be @xmath6 , and @xmath8 respectively , with an uncertainty of about a factor of @xmath63 due to the error in the determination of the background emission .",
    "the ratio of hi to molecular mass of the wlcs does not appear to be abnormal for clouds near the galactic center , provided we use the ratio of h@xmath27 to @xmath3co preferred for this region .",
    "it is striking that the wlcs extend in velocity from roughly 0 km s@xmath9 ( lsr ) to about 200 km s@xmath9 .",
    "moreover , both of these clouds appear to end at high velocity ridges , in the @xmath10v plane , that are very bright in 21-cm and extend over the entire observed longitude range ( fig .  2 ) .    these ridges are also visible in @xmath3co maps extending to several degrees in longitude ; however the ridges are much less prominent in co compared to hi .",
    "boyce and cohen ( 1994a ) have found similar structures ( which they call filaments ) in their oh absorption - line measurements , and these filaments seem to connect several of the seven wlcs described in this survey .",
    "we believe that these features provide important constraints to the physical origin of the enormous velocity dispersion of the wlcs .",
