    "green - hyperbolic operators are certain linear differential operators acting on sections of a vector bundle over a lorentzian manifold .",
    "they are , by definition , those operators which possess advanced and retarded green s operators .",
    "the most prominent examples are normally hyperbolic operators ( wave equations ) and dirac - type operators .",
    "the reason for introducing them in @xcite lies in the fact that they can be quantized ; one can canonically construct a bosonic locally covariant quantum field theory for them .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to study green - hyperbolic operators systematically from a geometric and an analytic perspective .",
    "the underlying lorentzian manifold must be well behaved for the analysis of hyperbolic operators . in technical terms , it must be globally hyperbolic . in the first section",
    "we collect material about such lorentzian manifolds .",
    "we introduce various compactness properties for closed subsets and show their interrelation .",
    "these considerations will later be applied to the supports of sections .    in the second section we study various spaces of smooth sections of our vector bundle .",
    "the crucial concept is that of a support system . this is a family of closed subsets of our manifold with certain properties making it suitable for defining a good space of sections by demanding that their supports be contained in the support system .",
    "we observe a duality principle ; a distributional section has support in a support system if and only if it extends to a continuous linear functional on test sections with support in the dual support system .",
    "green s operators and green - hyperbolic differential operators are introduced in the third section .",
    "we give various examples and show that the class of green - hyperbolic operators is closed under taking restrictions to suitable subregions of the manifold , under composition , under taking `` square roots '' , and under the direct sum construction .",
    "this makes it a large and very flexible class of differential operators to consider .",
    "we show that the green s operators are unique and that they extend to several spaces of sections .",
    "we argue that green - hyperbolic operators are not necessarily hyperbolic in any pde - sense and that they can not be characterized in general by well - posedness of a cauchy problem .",
    "the fourth section is devoted to extending the green s operators to distributional sections .",
    "we show that an important analytical result for the causal propagator ( the difference of the advanced and the retarded green s operator ) , also holds when one replaces smooth by distributional sections .    in the last section we study symmetric hyperbolic systems over globally hyperbolic manifolds .",
    "we provide detailed proofs of well - posedness of the cauchy problem , finiteness of the speed of propagation and the existence of green s operators .",
    "the crucial step in these investigations is an energy estimate for the solution to such a symmetric hyperbolic system .",
    "we conclude by observing that a symmetric hyperbolic system can be quantized in two ways ; one yields a _ bosonic _ and the other one a _",
    "fermionic _ locally covariant quantum field theory .    _",
