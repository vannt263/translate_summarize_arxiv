    "a recent study @xcite has cross - correlated the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies measured by wmap @xcite with galaxy fluctuations in the apm galaxy survey @xcite to find significant detections for both the integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) and thermal sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effects .",
    "the isw detection is in agreement with other analyses based on x - ray and radio sources @xcite , while @xcite fail to detect the sz effect when comparing wmap to different cluster templates ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it should be stressed nevertheless that cluster or galaxy group catalogues are too sparse and typically produce worse signal - to - noise ratios than galaxy surveys .",
    "moreover , depending on the sample there could be a significant cancellation of the isw and sz effects on scales smaller than a few degrees ( see  [ sec : pred ] ) . in this letter we cross -",
    "correlate the wmap cmb temperature anisotropies with galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) .",
    "when we were finishing this work we became aware of a similar analysis @xcite that uses different color and photometric redshift selected samples from the sdss .",
    "we make use of the largest datasets currently available to study the cmb - galaxy cross - correlation . in order to probe the galaxy distribution ,",
    "we have selected subsamples from the sdss data release 1 ( sdss dr1 ; @xcite ) which covers @xmath11 deg@xmath12 ( i.e , 5 @xmath13 of the sky ) .",
    "the samples analyzed here have different redshift distributions and a large number of galaxies ( 10@xmath14 - 10@xmath15 , depending on the sample ) .",
    "we concentrate our analysis on the north sky ( @xmath0 1500 deg@xmath12 , ie , 3.6 @xmath13 of the sky ) , because it contains the largest and wider strips .",
    "the south sdss dr1 ( @xmath0 500 deg@xmath12 ) consists of 3 narrow and disjoint @xmath16 strips , which are less adequate for our analysis .    our main sample , hereafter _",
    ", includes all objects classified as galaxies with extinction corrected magnitude @xmath17 , and a low associated error ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "this sample contains @xmath0 5 million galaxies distributed over the north sky .",
    "its predicted redshift distribution is broad and has a median redshift @xmath19 .",
    "our high - redshift sample ( _ sdss high - z _ thereafter ) comprises @xmath20 galaxies , with @xmath21 .",
    "it was selected by imposing magnitude cuts and color cuts perpendicular to the redshift evolution and the spectral type variations based on theoretical spectral synthesis models .",
    "we shall also compare our results to the apm analysis in @xcite , who used a @xmath22 sample , @xmath23 , area @xmath24 deg@xmath12 and 1.2 million galaxies .    for the cmb data , we use the first - year full - sky wmap maps @xcite .",
    "since the observed cmb - galaxy correlation is practically independent of the wmap frequency band used @xcite , we shall focus on the v - band ( @xmath25 ghz ) as it conveniently combines low pixel noise and high spatial resolution , @xmath26 .",
    "in addition , we have also used the w - band and a foreground `` cleaned '' wmap map @xcite to check that our results are free from galactic contamination .",
    "we mask out pixels using the conservative kp0 mask , that cuts out @xmath27 of the sky @xcite .",
    "all the maps used have been digitized into @xmath28 pixels using healpix , @xcite .",
    "we follow the notation introduced in @xcite .",
    "we define the cross - correlation function as the expectation value of density fluctuations @xmath29 and temperature anisotropies @xmath30 ( in @xmath31k ) at two positions @xmath32 and @xmath33 in the sky : @xmath34 , where @xmath35 .",
    "we compute the cmb - galaxy correlation and the associated statistical error - bars using the jack - knife ( jk ) method described in @xcite and references therein .",
    "the survey is divided into @xmath36 ( we find similar results for @xmath37 ) separate regions on the sky , each of equal area . the @xmath38 analysis is then performed @xmath39 times , each time removing a different region , the so - called jk subsamples .",
    "the covariance @xmath40 for @xmath38 between scales @xmath41 and @xmath42 is obtained by re - scaling the covariance of the jk subsamples by a factor @xmath43 ( see eq.[3 ] in @xcite ) . to test the jk errors and covariance we have also run @xmath44 wmap v - band monte - carlo ( mc ) realizations .",
    "we add random realizations of the measured wmap temperature angular power - spectrum @xcite to those of the white noise estimated for the relevant frequency band @xcite . for each mc simulation",
    "we estimate the mean `` accidental''correlation @xmath38 of simulated cmb maps to the sdss galaxy density fluctuation map .",
    "we also estimate the associated jk error in each mc simulation .",
    "fig.[fig : jackvs ] compares the true sampling error from the dispersion of @xmath45 in 200 mc simulations with the mean and dispersion of the jk errors over the same simulations .",
    "the jk error gives an excellent estimate of the true error up @xmath46 degrees . on larger scales it only underestimates the error by @xmath47 , which is hardly significant given the uncertainties .",
    "fig.[fig : wtg_mc ] shows @xmath38 for the different samples together with the corresponding jk error .",
    "it turns out that the the jk errors from the real wmap sample are in some cases smaller ( up to a factor of two ) than the jk errors ( or sample to sample dispersion ) from the mc simulations .",
    "fig.[fig : jackvs ] shows , as a dashed - line , the comparison for the _ sdss all _ sample , which exhibits the largest discrepancy .",
    "this difference in error estimation is not totally surprising as the mc simulations do not include any physical correlations and use a cmb power spectrum that is valid for the whole sky , and not constraint as to match the cmb power over the sdss region .",
    "the jk errors provide a model free estimation that is only subject to moderate ( @xmath48 ) uncertainty , while mc errors depend crucially on the model assumptions that go into the simulations . despite these differences in the mc error estimation",
    "the overall significance for the detection turns out to be smiliar , as explained in  4.1 .",
    "we derive the significance of the detected correlation taking into account the large ( jk ) covariance between neighboring ( logarithmic ) angular bins in survey sub - samples ( but see also  4.1 ) .",
    "adjacent bins at large scales ( @xmath49 ) are correlated at the @xmath50 level , dropping to @xmath51 for alternative bins .",
    "bins at smaller scales are progressively more correlated . to assign a conservative significance for the detection ( ie against @xmath52 ) we estimate the minimum @xmath53 fit for a constant @xmath38 and give the difference @xmath54 to the @xmath52 null detection .",
    "for example , at scales @xmath55 we find : @xmath56k for the _ sdss high - z _ sample , @xmath57k for the _ sdss all _ sample and @xmath58k for the apm , in all cases we give 1-@xmath4 errorbars .",
    "we find the largest significance in the cmb - galaxy correlation for the _ sdss high - z _ sample : @xmath59 ( ie probability , @xmath60 of no detection ) for @xmath61 ( being @xmath62 for @xmath63k with 11 d.o.f . , although the fit is only approximate as the signal drops with scale ) . in order to assess the significance levels for the isw and sz effects from the observed cmb - galaxy correlations",
    ", we shall first introduce model predictions .",
    "the temperature of cmb photons is gravitationally redshifted as they travel through the time - evolving dark - matter gravitational potential wells along the line - of - sight , from the last scattering surface @xmath64 to us , @xmath65 @xcite . at a given sky position @xmath66 : @xmath67 , and for a flat universe @xmath68 ( see eq.[7.14 ] in @xcite ) . in fourier space it reads , @xmath69 , and thus : w_tg^isw ( ) = < _",
    "t^isw_g > =  p(k )  g(k ) being , @xmath70 , where the isw window is @xmath71 , with @xmath72 mpc@xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 quantifies the time evolution of the gravitational potential .",
    "the galaxy window function is @xmath76 , which depends on the galaxy bias , linear dark - matter growth and the galaxy selection function .",
    "the isw predictions for the 3 samples are shown in in bottom panel of fig.[fig : w2pre ] . unless stated otherwise , we use the concordance @xmath77cdm model with @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "the weak lensing effect prediction is quite similar to the isw , we just need to replace the time derivative of the newtonian potential by its 2d laplacian @xcite : @xmath82 @xmath83 being the angular distance to the lensing sources ( with : @xmath84 ) .    for the thermal sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz )",
    "effect , we assume that the gas pressure @xmath85 fluctuations are traced by the galaxy fluctuations @xmath86 with a relative amplitude given by the gas bias , @xmath87 , representative of galaxy clusters , although @xmath88 is uncertain to within 50 @xmath13 on linear scales and for low - z sources @xcite . a simple conservative estimate of the sz effect is given by @xcite : w_tg^sz ( ) = -b_gas   w_gg ( ) where @xmath89 is the mean temperature change in cmb photons compton scattered by electrons in hot intracluster gas . following @xcite",
    ", we calculate @xmath90 , where @xmath91k is the mean cmb temperature , @xmath92 is the mean compton parameter induced by galaxy clusters , and @xmath93 is the negative sz spectral factor for the v - band .",
    "the compton parameter can be calculated integrating along the line of sight the normalized galaxy redshift distribution convolved with the volume - averaged density - weighted temperature .",
    "the latter is obtained from the mass function and the m - t relation .",
    "we assume the seth & tormen mass function @xcite and the m - t relation given by @xcite . in summary",
    ", we obtain for the wmap v - band , @xmath94k for the _ sdss all _ sample , and @xmath95k for the _ sdss high - z _ sample which corresponds to @xmath96 for both samples .",
    "the sz predictions for the 3 samples are shown in the bottom panel of fig.[fig : w2pre ] .",
    "note the galaxy auto - correlation explains most of the differences observed .",
    "the total predicted correlation is thus the sum of three terms : the isw , thermal sz and lensing contributions , @xmath97 .",
    "fig.[fig : w2pre ] shows individual contributions of these effects ( bottom panel ) and the total ( top ) for the 3 samples analyzed .",
    "the isw effect typically dominates for angles @xmath98 , while the sz effect is expected to be significant on small scales @xmath99 .",
    "lensing is found to be negligible at all scales for our samples .",
    "before we can make a direct comparison between theory and observations , we shall address the issue of galaxy bias .",
    "the higher redshift sample requires a high bias @xmath100 to explain the large cross - correlation seen at all scales ( the sz effect being smaller at high redshift ) . at low redshifts",
    "the measured correlation is dominated by the thermal sz on small scales ( @xmath2 ) and by isw on large - scales ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "here no bias is required to match the observations .",
    "this agrees quite well with our self - consistent bias estimation : for each sample we can estimate the ratio @xmath101 , where @xmath102 and @xmath103 are the ( theoretically predicted ) matter and ( measured ) galaxy auto - correlation functions . for apm and",
    "_ sdss all _ samples we find @xmath104 , while for the _ sdss high - z _ sample we get @xmath105 .      [ sec : isw ]    on large scales @xmath1 , the isw effect is expected to dominate for all survey depths ( see fig [ fig : w2pre ] ) .",
    "therefore , from the large - angle cmb - galaxy correlation , we can directly infer the isw effect ( ie , @xmath106 , see end of  [ sec : cross ] ) .",
    "in particular , for the _ sdss high - z _ sample , a constant correlation fit rejects the null detection with high significance @xmath107 ( @xmath108 ) , comparable to the level found for the apm survey , @xmath109 .",
    "a smaller significance is obtained for the _ sdss all _ sample : @xmath110 ( p@xmath111 ) .",
    "alternatively , we can use the uncorrelated mc simulations ( see  3 ) to have an independent estimate of the significance .",
    "when a particular mc simulation has an accidentally large value of @xmath38 it also has a large jk error associated . we can thus assign a significance to our measurement by asking how many of the 200 mc simulations have a value of @xmath38 equal or larger than the observations with an assosiated jk error equal or smaller than found for the observations .",
    "we find that only two of the mc simulations fulfil this condition in any of the samples , meaning that the significance of each detection is better than @xmath112 ( for each of the 3 different data samples ) .",
    "since these samples are basically independent , we can combine them to infer a total significance for the isw detection : we find a total @xmath113 ( @xmath114 for 3 d.o.f ) corresponding to a 3.3@xmath4 .",
    "note we could do better using a ( scale dependent ) model theory prediction , but at the cost of introducing model dependent detection levels .",
    "moreover , we can further include the isw - dominated small angle bins in our deepest sample , where sz is negligible , increasing the significance to @xmath115 , ( @xmath116 for 3 d.of . ) , ie we detect the isw effect at the a 3.6@xmath4 level .",
    "[ sec : sz ]    we can estimate the significance of the drop in the signal at small angles in the _",
    "sdss all _ and apm samples due to the sz effect ( see fig[fig : w2pre ] ) using the best - fit constant at large angles ( ie , the isw signal ) and ask for the observed deviation from such value at smaller scales . for @xmath99 ,",
    "we find : @xmath117 for _ sdss all _ , and @xmath118 for apm ( 1-@xmath4 errorbars ) .",
    "note this is conservative because the isw increases slightly as we approach smaller scales ( see  iv ) .",
    "this test gives @xmath119 for the _ sdss all _ sample and @xmath120 for the apm .",
    "we have measured the cmb - galaxy correlation using wmap and the sdss dr1 galaxy survey .",
    "we measure a significant cross - correlation at low ( z @xmath121 ) and high ( z @xmath122 ) redshifts .",
    "we detect a positive correlation on large - scales induced by the isw effect at the 2@xmath4 level for the ( broadly distributed ) low - z sample .",
    "this correlation is similar to that measured for the lower redshift ( @xmath123 ) apm galaxies @xcite , although the latter has a larger significance , 2.5@xmath4 .",
    "moreover , the significance of the detection raises to 3@xmath4 for the sdss high - z sample .",
    "the combined analysis for the 3 samples gives a 3.6@xmath4 significance ( see  [ sec : chi2 ] ) .",
    "our measurements at large scales are in good agreement with isw predictions for a dark - energy dominated universe .",
    "fig [ fig : fitlambda ] shows the probability distribution for @xmath7 in a flat model .",
    "we have fixed @xmath81 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "as we vary @xmath7 the shape parameter for the linear power spectrum @xmath126 consistently changes @xmath127 @xcite .",
    "we only use the data for @xmath1 , where the isw is the dominant contribution .",
    "we fix the bias @xmath8 by comparing the matter angular auto - correlation function in each model to the galaxy auto - correlation in each sample .",
    "we find @xmath128 for the apm and _ sdss all _ samples and @xmath129 for the _ sdss high - z _ sample .",
    "the @xmath130 value in each model refers to the minimum @xmath53 fit to a constant in the range @xmath131 .",
    "as can be seen in the figure , all samples prefer large values of @xmath7 , with the best fit @xmath9 with a 2@xmath4 range @xmath132 .",
    "we also see evidence ( 2.7 @xmath4 level ) for the thermal sz effect from the drop of the cmb - galaxy correlation on small - scales in the low - z samples of sdss and apm galaxies .",
