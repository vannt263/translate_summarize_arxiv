    "many of the neutrino experiments now operating or in preparation are those with artificial neutrino beams .",
    "the beam energy ranges from @xmath1 to about @xmath2 ( minos , cngs , t2k ) .",
    "the uniform theoretical description of neutrino interaction within this region is problematic , because three different dynamics : quasielastic(qe ) , resonance excitation(res ) , and deep inelastic scattering(dis ) must be taken into account . especially in the region of about @xmath3",
    "they contribute with comparable strength and the problem of the overlap between the dis formalism and the resonances production model appears .",
    "up to now most of the monte carlo codes use the rein - sehgal model of the resonances production .",
    "however , another approach has been proposed  @xcite which makes use of the postulated quark - hadron duality in neutrino reactions .",
    "one can assume that the contributions from higher resonances are averaged by the deep inelastic scattering structure functions and only the dominant @xmath0 resonance has to be treated separately .",
    "in this approach the exclusive inelastic final states must be obtained from the dis formalism even in the resonance region @xmath4 , where the most important contribution comes from pion production channels .",
    "dynamical models included in the generator are described below . for the quasielastic scattering",
    "the usual llewellyn smith  @xcite model is used with bbba05 form factors  @xcite . for elastic scattering",
    "new strange form factors are taken into account  @xcite .",
    "for antineutrino cc interaction there are three additional channels with hyperons @xmath5 production(@xmath6 ) .",
    "the @xmath0 resonance is described by the form factors as in  @xcite , and for dis we use parton distribution functions grv94  @xcite with modification proposed by  @xcite . in order to get the final state from the inclusive dis cross section we use model of fragmentation based on the lund model , implemented in the pythia6 generator .",
    "it is assumed that the interaction occurs on a separate constituent of the nucleon .",
    "the fragmentation procedure was described in  @xcite . in order to get good agreement with experimentally measured charged particle multiplicity  @xcite",
    "we have changed a few pythia6 parameters .",
    "the final values , fine - tuned for specific procedure of choosing the interacting parton inside the nucleon , are : parj(32)=@xmath7 , parj(33 ) = @xmath8 , parj(34 ) = @xmath3 , parj(36)= @xmath9 , mstj(17 ) = 3 . the definitions and default values of the parameters one can find in pythia manual  @xcite .",
    "we use a procedure which gives exclusive cross sections for each single pion production channel ( spp ) : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the percentage of the given spp channel within the overall dis cross section .",
    "the function @xmath12 defines transition between    .,title=\"fig : \" ] +    .",
