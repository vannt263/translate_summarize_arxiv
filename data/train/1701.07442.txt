    "strongly magnetized neutron stars ( magnetars + * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are extremely powerful x - ray and soft gamma - ray emitters , in particular under the form of large flares .",
    "these flares might reach luminosities that in our galaxy second only supernova explosions .",
    "in particular , magnetars emit a large variety of flares and outbursts on timescales from fraction of seconds to years , on a vast range of luminosities from @xmath3 to @xmath4@xcite .",
    "the most energetic events they ever emitted , called _ giant flares _ , have been detected three times in the past few decades , from three magnetars : the soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgr ) 0526 - 66 on 1979 march 5 @xcite , sgr1900 + 14 on 1998 august 27 @xcite and the last and more energetic one on 2004 december 27 from sgr1806 - 20 @xcite .",
    "all of them are characterized by a very luminous initial spike ( @xmath5 ) , lasting less than a second , which decays rapidly into a softer tail ( modulated at the neutron star spin period ) lasting several hundreds of seconds ( with luminosities of @xmath6 ) .",
    "the nature of the steady and flaring high energy emission from these sources has been intriguing all along .",
    "in fact , magnetar s x - ray luminosity is in general too high to be produced by the pulsar rotational energy losses alone , as for more common isolated radio pulsars , and the lack of any companion star excludes an accretion scenario .",
    "it is now well established that the peculiarities of these extreme highly magnetized objects ( @xmath7gauss ) are related to the strength and instability of their magnetic field , that at times might stress the stiff neutron star crust @xcite , might rearrange itself locally in small twisted bundles , or disrupt and reconnect higher up in the magnetosphere producing large ejections of particles .",
    "the ages of the @xmath825 magnetars known ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , derived from their rotational properties ( @xmath9 ) , indicate a young population , typically a few thousand years old . in three or four cases there",
    "are reasonably accepted associations with supernova remnants @xcite , as well as massive star clusters @xcite .",
    "sgr@xmath101900@xmath014 is one of the youngest magnetars known ( @xmath81kyr ) .",
    "a very prolific burster @xcite , it is embedded in a cluster of very massive stars @xcite and it is one of the three magnetars which has shown a giant flare .",
    "this magnetar was observed using all three instruments onboard the nasa _",
    "spitzer space telescope _ in 2005 and 2007 @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , these observations have revealed a prominent ring - like structure ( see figure1 ) in the 16@xmath11 m and 24@xmath11 m wave - bands , not detected in the 3.68.0@xmath11 m observations .",
    "a formal elliptical fit to the ring indicates semi - major and semi - minor axes of angular lengths @xmath1236  and @xmath1219  , respectively , centred at the position of the magnetar sgr@xmath101900@xmath014 .",
    "no equivalent feature was observed at radio or x - ray wavelengths ( @xmath13 , and @xmath14 ; with @xmath15 being the distance in units of 12.5kpc ; @xcite ) .",
    "the _ spitzer _ images are dominated by the bright emission from two nearby m supergiants that mark the centre of a compact cluster of massive stars at a distance of @xmath812.5kpc , believed to have hosted the magnetar progenitor star @xcite .",
    "the physical size of the ring at this distance is @xmath16pc , it has a temperature @xmath17k ( estimated using a realistic dust model : * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and a flux of 0.4@xmath180.1jy and 1.2@xmath180.2jy at 16 and 24@xmath11 m , respectively ( corresponding to l(16@xmath11m)@xmath19and l(24@xmath11m)@xmath20 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however",
    ", the inevitable difficulties in the analysis of this faint and complicated structure make these values rather uncertain and preclude a detailed assessment of the true ring morphology .",
    "the ring - like structure has been interpreted as due to illumination from nearby stars of a dust free cavity produced by the giant flare @xcite .    in this work",
    "we show the results of a series of radiation transfer ( rt ) calculations performed with a 3d dust radiative transfer code _ dart - ray _ @xcite aimed at reproducing the emission of the infrared ring around sgr@xmath101900@xmath014 , assuming different plausible distributions for the dust illuminated by the nearby stars . in  [ setup ] we introduce our initial assumptions , method , and the rt calculations .",
    "results and discussion follow in  [ results ] and  [ discussion ] .    .magnetar and close - by star properties@xmath21 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     _",
    "the tabulated discrepancies are calculated with respect to the data surface brightness profiles and are in units of the data background noise @xmath22 .",
    "the averages are shown separately for @xmath231.2pc and @xmath241.2 pc . _",
    "we have performed several dust rt calculations assuming elliptical dust shell / cavity geometries as well as a disrupted wind profile , and by positioning the two supergiants stars inside or outside the dust cavity .",
    "we have found that the dust ring morphology , similar to that found on the spitzer data of sgr1900 + 14 , is recovered only in the cases where the stars are inside the cavity .",
    "furthermore , we approximately reproduce the total integrated fluxes at 16 and 24@xmath11 m only by assuming a gas density of @xmath25 for all the dust geometries we assumed . the corresponding mass of the dust responsible for the ring emission is @xmath262m@xmath27 . + given these results , the first question to ask is whether or not the models that reproduce the observed dust emission morphology and total flux are realistic or not .",
    "in particular the gas density , implied by our modelling to explain the _ spitzer _ infrared luminosity by dust illumination , appears to be very high compared to that of the diffuse galactic ism . before discussing the possible nature of this high density , we first clarify what assumptions / parameters in our modelling might have caused an artificial high gas density , not representative of the real ism density around the magnetar .",
    "firstly , we point out that the gas density is not measured directly from the gas emission but inferred from the dust density divided by a dust - to gas ratio of 0.00619 ( which is characteristic of the assumed milky way dust model , see section [ simulations ] )",
    ". however , this dust - to - gas ratio , representative of the kpc scale ism of the nearby milky way regions , presents significant local variations in the ism ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , since the assumed size distribution of the grains is also representative of the local milky way , this also has an effect on the derived dust density .",
    "in fact , the mir emission in our modelling is mainly produced by small grains ( sizes @xmath28 m ) which are stochastically heated .",
    "if the grain size distribution is more skewed towards smaller grain sizes , compared to the one we are assuming , this would require significantly less dust mass to reproduce the observed mir emission .",
    "the grain size distribution is known to be affected by both dust destruction and formation processes , but it is not possible to constrain it further with our observations . on the other hand , we also note that if the cavity has been created by dust destruction , the grain size distribution there should instead favour the presence of large dust grains rather than small ones @xcite .",
    "in fact , a number of studies @xcite have shown that the x - ray flux is more effective at destroying small grains than larger ones .",
    "the precise evolution of the dust grain distribution is dependent on both the spectral shape and overall intensity of the illuminating source , on the composition of the grains , as well as on the relative importance of the processes of x - ray heating , coulomb explosion and ion field emission , the last two of which being particularly uncertain @xcite . however , even within these uncertainties , all the models generally predict that smaller grains will be destroyed to larger distances than larger ones are destroyed by a source with energy spectral index @xmath29 scales as @xmath30 if grain charging is limited by internal energy losses , or as @xmath31 if limited by the electrostatic potential . ] .",
    "therefore , there would be a region in which only selective destruction took place , leaving behind a dust distribution skewed towards large grains . at the inner edge the distribution",
    "would be skewed towards big grains , progressively changing into the undisturbed ( pre - burst ) distribution at larger distances .",
    "an attempt at modeling these effects would be worthwhile if the quality of the data were to allow a comparison with observations , but this is not possible with the current data .",
    "finally , in our modelling we only assumed the two supergiant stars , the most luminous stars in the field , to be heating the dust shell / cavity .",
    "however , other sources of radiation might well play a role ( e.g. other fainter stars within the cavity ) and , in this case , the needed gas density to match the observed fluxes would be lower .",
    "on the other hand , note that the constant @xmath32erg / s x - ray luminosity emitted by the magnetar is too low to power the dust emission .",
    "in fact , the wavelength ",
    "integrated dust emission luminosity for the models that fit the mir fluxes is in the range 3.7 - 4 @xmath33erg / s .",
    "an additional mechanism to heat the dust is also collisional heating in hot plasma , where the dust is heated by the collisions with high energy electrons .",
    "this is expected if the dust is embedded in shocked gas with temperatures of order of 10@xmath34 k. however , in this case we might expect to see an x - ray diffuse emission from the hot gas around the magnetar as well , which is not observed .",
    "+ vrba et al.(2000 ) argued that sgr 1900 + 14 is associated with a cluster of young stars ( much fainter in apparent magnitude than the two m supergiants we considered in our modelling ) which are probably embedded in a dense medium .",
    "this interpretation is qualitatively consistent with our results .",
    "as proposed by @xcite , the 1998 giant flare could have produced the cavity by destroying the dust within it .",
    "assuming a constant dust density within the cavity region , corresponding to n@xmath35=1000@xmath2 , we estimated a total dust mass of order of 3m@xmath27 that was plausibly present before being destroyed by the flare .",
    "an energy of about @xmath36erg would suffice to destroy this amount of dust , consistent with the estimates by @xcite based on eq . 25 in @xcite .",
    "the size of the region with destroyed dust would be larger for smaller grains , as discussed above . in this scenario ,",
    "the high density we derived would be similar to the high density ism around the magnetar .",
    "furthermore , we note that high density of the ism ( n@xmath35=10@xmath3710@xmath38 @xmath2 ) has been found in the environment surrounding grbs @xcite , which should be similar to that where magnetars are located .",
    "the wind model we considered was meant to be similar to the scenario where the dust distribution outside the cavity was mainly determined by the wind of the magnetar progenitor while internally disrupted by the giant flare . however , gas densities at 1pc distance in a typical stellar wind are expected to be several orders of magnitudes lower than those we found ( @xmath39@xmath2 , estimated from the mass - loss rates @xmath40 of @xcite assuming @xmath41 with @xmath42 = 1000 km / s ) .",
    "thus , this last scenario is unlikely if the ring density is indeed so high . +",
    "another possibility is that the dust emission ring is the infrared emission from the supernova remnant ( snr ) of the magnetar progenitor .",
    "the dust mass associated with the shell model with @xmath43=1000@xmath2 is @xmath44=1.9m@xmath27 , which is a factor 34 higher than the measurement of dust mass around sn1987 by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath45 ) .",
    "however , given the large uncertainties in the inferred dust masses , and that our value for the dust density might have been overestimated because of the reasons given above , it may well be that the amount of dust needed for the shell model is compatible with that of snrs .",
    "the snr scenario was also considered by @xcite but discarded because of the lack of observed radio and x - ray emission from the ring . however ,",
    "if we consider i ) the ir / x luminosity ratio of @xmath46 measured by @xcite for many snrs , ii ) the total ir luminosity of the ring in our models ( @xmath47erg / s ) , and the x - ray detection limit for the ring ( @xmath48erg / s in the 210kev band * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this structure is still compatible with being a snr with high ir / x ratio .",
    "+ on the other hand , we can also compare the 24@xmath11 m luminosity with the expected x - ray luminosity , according to figure 12 of @xcite , which studied a sample of snr in the large magellanic cloud .",
    "if the magnetar was located at the distance of the lmc ( 50kpc ) , we would have @xmath49erg / s/@xmath50 , and the relative expected x - ray flux would be @xmath51erg / s/@xmath50 .",
    "this would translate in an intrinsic x - ray luminosity of @xmath52erg / s , which should have been clearly detected in the case of the sgr 1900 + 14 .",
    "hence , given the information we have at hand we can not discard the snr scenario on the base of the observed ir / x - ray luminosity ratio , although it would be a rather peculiar remnant compared with what we see around other galactic pulsars or magnetars @xcite .",
    "however , if we also consider the shape of the normalized average surface brightness profiles , shown in fig.[fig : norm_prof ] , this provides a strong evidence that 1 ) there is very little amount of dust inside the cavity and 2 ) the emitting dust is much more extended than a simple thin shell .",
    "these findings are compatible with the scenario where the cavity has been produced by the giant flare within a high density medium",
    ". however , the snr scenario would still be acceptable in the case the transition in density between the shell and the surrounding ism is smoother than what we assumed in our modelling .",
    "regardless of the origin or the exact distribution of the illuminated dust , or the exact nature of the dust free cavity , our models show that we are able to observe this illuminated dust structure only because of two favourable characteristics : 1 ) the high dust density in the local region , and 2 ) the illuminating stars coincidentally lay inside the shell . similar dust structures",
    "might potentially be present around many other magnetars or pulsars but they would be invisible to us because of the lack of either one of the two above local properties of this particular object .",
