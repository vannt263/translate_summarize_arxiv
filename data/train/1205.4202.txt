    "george gabriel stokes might not have anticipated the importance of his endeavor when challenging his students in 1847 to calculate the collapse motion of an empty bubble in water @xcite .",
    "the reach of this academic exercise was recognized in 1917 by lord rayleigh @xcite who conveyed a link between collapsing bubbles and the erosion damage found on ship propellers .",
    "the basic equation of motion of a collapsing bubble @xcite , now known as the rayleigh equation ( re ) , reads @xmath15 where the bubble radius @xmath16 is a function of the time @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is a constant .",
    "given the initial conditions @xmath19 and the definition @xmath20 , the re describes the collapse of an empty spherical bubble of initial radius @xmath9 in an incompressible , inviscid , infinite liquid with uniform far - field pressure @xmath4 and density @xmath5 .",
    "if , alternatively , @xmath18 is defined as @xmath21 , the re extends to the case of a gas - filled bubble with constant inner pressure @xmath22 . the re neglects non - condensable bubble gas , as well as surface tension and viscosity @xcite , liquid compressibility @xcite , and thermal effects @xcite .",
    "however , regardless of those limitations and various enhanced models available today @xcite , the re remains widely used in practice , owing to its simplicity and often sufficient accuracy .",
    "this is despite the fact that the re yields no closed - form solution for @xmath23 .",
    "while numerical solutions can be obtained , systematic analytical approximations offer better insight into the mathematical nature of the collapse , as we will show in this paper .",
    "analytical approximations also become handy when the re is integrated into multi - scale models , and they offer an intuitive understanding for the collapse motion . in this paper",
    "we develop highly accurate , yet remarkably efficient analytical approximations for the solution of the re .",
    "we first recall the standard normalization of the re , based on which the analytical approximations are then obtained in a systematic way .",
    "these approximations are then compared against high - precision measurements of the most spherical bubbles available today .",
    "a short discussion concludes the paper .",

    "the parameter @xmath59 can be determined in two ways .",

    "( [ eq_conservation_normalized ] ) implies @xmath65 as @xmath66 . matching the powers of the two asymptotic functions we find @xmath67 .",
    "the coincidental close similarity of @xmath59 determined at @xmath68 and @xmath63 suggests that @xmath45 is a good approximation of @xmath10 for both values of @xmath59 .",

    "this approximation is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig_models](b ) .",
    "its similarity to the rayleigh function @xmath10 is demonstrated by the small residual @xmath72 , shown in fig .",

    "[ fig_models](d ) , takes absolute values up to @xmath77 .",

    "the zeroth - order approximation @xmath45 yields a maximal error @xmath146 of only about 0.01 , whereas the best approximation @xmath47 , expressed in terms of the polylogarithm , reduces this error to below @xmath130 .",
    "moreover , approximations @xmath46 with any smaller accuracy can be systematically constructed .",
    "for example , if 0.1% accuracy is desired then @xmath147 suffices . a comparison of these approximations against state - of - the - art measurements of highly spherical cavitation bubbles revealed that the residuals @xmath148 are more than 100 times smaller than the observed residuals @xmath142 , shown in fig .",
