    "the gas becomes molecular due to shielding from the ambient interstellar radiation field and dense regions can be identified observationally as ( giant ) molecular cloud complexes .",
    "their subsequent evolution is determined basically by supersonic compressible turbulence and self - gravity , acting simultaneously @xcite .    at the very begining of mc evolution ( a few myr ) supersonic turbulence generates complex nets of condensations and dilutions which results in a lognormal probability distribution of mass density @xcite , i.e. , a gaussian distribution of the logdensity .",
    "such type of probability distribution function ( hereafter , pdf ) is in agreement with the observed hierarchical ( fractal ) structure of gas condensations in galactic clouds @xcite . at a later evolutionary stage of @xmath3  myr @xcite ,",
    "self - gravity becomes significant in the energy budget of the cloud .",
    "gravitational and kinetic energy reach roughly equipartition at different spatial scales @xcite and different cloud substructures start to collapse on their own free - fall timescales .",
    "the cloud undergoes a so called hierarchical gravitational collapse @xcite .",
    "meanwhile the warm atomic gas from the cloud halo continues to accrete onto the cloud @xcite , causing an increase of its mass .",
    "the gas gets cooler ; it crosses the region of phase transition between the atomic and molecular phase .",
    "material moves through all fractal scales under the influence of supersonic turbulence and gravity ; at the lower scale limit of this gravoturbulent cascade a fraction of the gas is transformed to stars while most of it disperses again in the interstellar medium . within a period of several myr , before young stars",
    "emerge and provide feedback , one could consider all processes being in a rough equilibrium at all hierarchical scales and at timescales significantly smaller than the dynamical cloud time .",
    "this equilibrium is essentially statistical and should be understood as referring to averaged quantities and to abstract objects like fractal scales .",
    "the originally lognormal density pdf gradually changes under the influence of self - gravity .",
    "its high - density part transforms into a power - law ( pl ) ` tail ' with a negative slope .",
    "gas condensations , in which stars form , are representative of this density regime .",
    "the slope of the pl tail gets slowly shallower while the lognormal component of the pdf shape undergoes minor changes @xcite  another hint to a statistical equilibrium .",
    "thus the density pdf is an important tool to study the cloud physics .",
    "it bears signature of the cloud evolution , contains information about the cloud structure and is verifiable from numerical simulations and observations . on the other hand ,",
    "saturated supersonic turbulence and gravity create a self - similar hierarchy of scales which can be considered as fractal cloud structure characterized by scaling laws of mass , density and velocity fluctuation @xcite .",
    "establishing a link between the notion of abstract scale and the density pdf is , therefore , fundamental for development of a more systematic theory of mcs .    in this paper",
    "we propose a statistical model that quantifies this link .",
    "section [ sec - statstr ] introduces the basic concepts like mc class of equivalence , abstract fractal scales and their relation to the density pdf .",
    "then , the cases of a pl pdf ( section [ sec - pl - tail ] ) and an arbitrary continuous pdf ( section [ sec - arbitrary pdf ] ) are considered , with derivation of the scaling relations from analysis of the pdf and of a parameter which characterizes the cloud structure .",
    "section [ sec-2d case ] is dedicated to the cloud structure as described by surface mass density distribution and its relation to the 3d ( mass density ) case . in section [ discussion ]",
    "we discuss on the applicability of the model to several general types of observational and numerical pdfs .",
    "section [ sec - disc - concl ] contains our conclusions .",
    "let us consider  for the purpose of our general study ,  an abstract model of mc .",
    "the cloud is spherical with mass density profile @xmath4 , determined from the mass density pdf in the real medium .",
    "the scales @xmath5 in that model are defined simply as radii measured from the centre of the sphere to a given density level and span the range @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the size of the whole cloud and @xmath8 is the size of its homogeneous core .",
    "the proposed model is representative of a _ mc class of equivalence_. by assumption ,",
    "all class members are characterized by single mass density pdf , single cloud size , single size , density of the core and density at the cloud s edge .",
    "we stress that individual members could have very different morphology and , probably , different physics , but for the purpose of this work the abovementioned characteristics are sufficient to describe the class . in other words ,",
    "an mc class of equivalence resembles a statistical ensemble for which the averaged member possesses spherical symmetry and isotropy .",
    "this averaged member is an abstract object which is statistically representative for the behaviour of any single member of the class .",
    "it is conceptually similar to the spherically symmetric nested mc model of @xcite ; the difference is that those authors use it as a simplification of the real cloud .    in the following",
    "we will use mainly the volume - weighted mass density pdf @xmath9 .",
    "the natural variable in the model is the logarithmic density @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the average density of the whole cloud .",
    "the abstract scales of the fractal are defined as follows : @xmath12 where the upper integration limit is taken to be infinity , i.e. it corresponds to very large densities .",
    "thus @xmath13 is radius of the sphere , corresponding to density level @xmath14 .",
    "the suggested definition of scale is abstract in the sense that @xmath13 is not related to size of any contiguous objects , delineated by analysis of mc intensity maps or through some clump extraction techniques . on the other hand ,",
    "it is not a purely mathematical construct like , e.g. the lag in the @xmath15-variance method @xcite or the quantity defining the wave number in fourier analysis of star - forming regions .",
    "it contains implicitly the physics of the considered mc through the mass density pdf .",
    "similar definition is adopted by @xcite but on an additional assumption , simplifying the cloud structure .    in the definition of scale ( equation [ def_abstr - scale ] ) we neglect the size of the core @xmath16 to simplify the calculations .",
    "this generates a singularity in the expression for density profile ( equation [ dens_profile ] ) which is not significant in the further considerations and does not affect the results .",
    "let us introduce a power - law density pdf : @xmath17 where the dimensionless exponent typically spans the range @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "for the sake of convenience in calculations , we redefine @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the density at cloud s outer edge .",
    "as will be demonstrated later , @xmath20 and @xmath11 are equivalent within a factor of few .",
    "it is worth to note that @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the core density .",
    "the constant @xmath23 in equation [ def_pl - tail ] can be derived from the normalization condition of probability :    @xmath24\\simeq -q\\ ] ]    per definition , the volume - weighted pdf is :    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the volume of a sphere with radius @xmath13 and @xmath27 is the difference between cloud volume and core volume .",

    "in other words , there is an unambiguous correspondence between a density profile with constant exponent and a pl pdf @xcite . ] :    @xmath35    the exponent in this equation is usually denoted @xmath36 in the literature , where @xmath37 is positive and labelled `` density profile '' .",
