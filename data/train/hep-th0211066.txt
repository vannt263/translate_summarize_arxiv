    "it consists of a higgs field in the adjoint representation of the gauge group and through the spontaneous symmetry breakdown of su(2 ) to u(1 ) two of the three gauge bosons @xmath9 as well as the higgs boson itself gain mass .",
    "the massless gauge boson is associated with the unbroken u(1 ) symmetry and identified with the photon .    in 1974 ,",
    "t hooft and polyakov @xcite made the interesting observation that the bosonic part of the georgi - glashow model allows for soliton solutions , i.e. particle - like , finite energy solutions , which due to their topological properties carry a non - trivial magnetic charge and have thus been named `` magnetic monopoles '' .    since the @xmath10 solution was shown to be the unique spherically symmetric solution @xcite",
    ", construction of higher winding number solutions longed for an ansatz with less symmetry .",
    "after their existence has been proved @xcite , axially symmetric monopoles have been constructed @xcite .",
    "these monopoles can be thought of as two monopoles superposed on each other at the origin with torus - like energy density . since monopoles in the bogomolnyi - prasad - sommerfield ( bps ) limit @xcite are non - interacting @xcite , while for non - vanishing higgs boson mass a coulomb - like repulsive force acts between them @xcite , the mass per winding number of the @xmath11-multimonopole is equal to ( resp .",
    "bigger than ) @xmath11 times the mass of the @xmath10 monopole for vanishing ( resp .",
    "non - vanishing ) higgs boson mass @xcite .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that in flat space no bound multimonopoles are possible .",
    "however , the inclusion of gravity @xcite and/or a dilaton @xcite can render attraction if the higgs boson mass is small enough .",
    "a lot of work has been done on the topic of embedding su(2 ) monopoles into higher gauge groups @xcite .",
    "the embedding into su(5 ) has been constructed in @xcite where through the introduction of an 24-dimensional higgs field in the adjoint representation as well as a 5-dimensional higgs field in the fundamental representation the breakdown of su(5 ) to su(3)@xmath3 u(1 ) is achieved . because of the above arguments for su(5 ) not being a good canditate for a gut @xcite , scientists have lost interest in this model .",
    "recently , however , it was shown @xcite that the monopole spectrum produced in the breakdown of su(5 ) to ( su(3 ) @xmath3 su(2 ) @xmath3",
    "u(1))/ @xmath12 corresponds to the spectrum of one family of fermions in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "thus interest has grown again .",
    "an explicit analytical bps solution was constructed in this model @xcite .    here",
    "we construct axially symmetric su(5 ) monopoles both in flat and curved space as well as the corresponding black hole solutions .",
    "we give the model and the ansatz in section ii .",
    "we discuss the flat space solutions in section iii , the gravitating solutions in section iv and the non - abelian black hole solutions in section v. we give our conclusions in section vi .",
    "we consider an su(5 ) einstein - yang - mills - higgs ( eymh ) model with the following action : @xmath13 where the matter langragian @xmath14 is given by @xmath15 with field strength tensor @xmath16\\ ] ] and covariant derivative @xmath17\\ ] ] such that @xmath18 and the @xmath19 fulfill the su(5 ) lie - algebra .",

    "note that the solutions have an additional @xmath29 symmetry because we have left out a possible cubic term in the potential .",
    "the reason for this is that the inclusion of a @xmath30-term in the potential would not lead to an algebraically expressible vev .",
    "the vev would have to be computed numerically .",

    "they are given by :    @xmath92    @xmath93    and all other matter functions identically zero .",

    "for @xmath96 , the mass scales like @xmath97 . to obtain the solution with the right bcs for our model , we have to choose @xmath98 . for @xmath99 and/or @xmath100 , @xmath101",
    ", the solutions have to be constructed numerically . in all our numerical studies",
    "however , the solution ( [ bps1 ] ) , ( [ bps2 ] ) proved to be a good starting solution .",
    "we were mainly interested in the effect of the potential .",
    "we thus first studied the behaviour of the higgs field function @xmath65 for different values of the coupling constants @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "our results for the @xmath10 monopole are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "for @xmath91 , @xmath65 is given ( analytically ) by ( [ bps1 ] ) .",
    "for @xmath104 , @xmath105 , the function still seems to decay power - law like rather than exponentially , while for both @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 the exponential decay is apparent . from ( [ mass ] ) , we see that for @xmath105 only one of the higgs fields is massive , while all others remain massless .",
    "this can also be seen by an asymptotic analysis for the case @xmath105 .",
    "we set @xmath109 the linearised equations for the three higgs field functions @xmath65 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 read ( with the prime denoting the derivative with respect to @xmath110 ) : @xmath111 the matrix @xmath112 has one eigenvector , @xmath113 itself with eigenvalue @xmath114 and two eigenvectors @xmath115 , @xmath116 , the ones orthogonal to @xmath113 , with eigenvalues @xmath117 . the solution of the linearised equation is then given by : @xmath118 clearly at large @xmath110 , the power - law decay dominates the behaviour of the higgs field functions .    in fig .  2 we present the mass per winding number of the @xmath10 monopole and the @xmath119 multimonopole in units of @xmath120 , @xmath98 for three different cases : a ) @xmath100 , @xmath105 , b ) @xmath121 , @xmath106 and c ) @xmath122",
    "apparently , for all cases , the monopoles are in a repulsive phase , as expected .",
    "however , it seems that the mass depends only slightly on @xmath102 . in the case of @xmath105",
    ", the potential can be written as a perfect square and thus resembles the potential of the su(2 ) case .",
    "however , it should be noted that the present model is not an embedding in the sense that the vacuum expectation value has only two non - vanishing diagonal entries .",
    "we find the following values for the energy per winding number @xmath123 for the @xmath10 monopole and the @xmath119 multimonopole for @xmath102 ( respectively @xmath103 ) @xmath124 :    table 1 +    [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     clearly , the phenomenon observed for intermediate higgs masses in the su(2 ) model @xcite is observed here for @xmath125 , while a second branch of solutions exists only for @xmath126 . for all other @xmath103",
    "we find that @xmath127 .",
    "analogous to the su(2 ) case , the gravitating monopoles bifurcate with the branch of extremal reissner - nordstrm ( rn ) solutions in the limit @xmath128 ( resp .",
    "@xmath129 ) .",
    "the approach to criticality is shown for the two higgs fields @xmath67 , @xmath68 in fig.s 4a , 4b . for @xmath106 , @xmath130 .",
    "@xmath67 and @xmath68 are shown as functions of the dimensionless schwarzschild - coordinate @xmath131 for four different values of the gravitational coupling @xmath132 .",
    "clearly , the limiting solution is not yet reached for @xmath133 , but rather for @xmath134 , the numerical values of which are given in table 2 .",
    "an extremal horizon @xmath135 forms and @xmath67 as well as @xmath68 are constant and equal to their asymptotic values for @xmath136 , while they are non - trivial for @xmath110 @xmath137 @xmath138 $ ] .",
    "this is very similar to what was observed previously in the su(2 ) case for the remaining matter field functions .",
    "striking is that the two functions look qualitatively very similar in their approach to criticality .",
    "looking at the results of flat space , we expect that a similar pattern exists for the case of @xmath122 , while for @xmath100 , @xmath105 , we find that @xmath133 depends only very little on @xmath102 .",
    "while in flat space su(2 ) monopoles as well as su(5 ) monopoles - as was demonstrated by us in this paper - are either repelling or non - interacting ( in the bps limit ) , it was shown in the su(2 ) case @xcite that gravity is able to overcome the repulsion for sufficiently small higgs boson masses .",
    "we thus limit our analysis of axially symmetric su(5 ) monopoles to this important point .",
    "we find that for a fixed @xmath132 the values of @xmath139 , @xmath140 for which the mass of the @xmath10 monopole is equal to the mass per winding number of the @xmath119 multimonopole roughly forms a half - circle in the @xmath102-@xmath103-plane .",
    "e.g. we find for @xmath141 , that for @xmath105 the value of @xmath142 , while for @xmath106 we have @xmath143 and for @xmath144 .",
    "this suggests that @xmath145 we find that @xmath146 is an increasing function of @xmath132 , e.g. we find that @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "this latter value of @xmath146 for @xmath149 suggests in comparison with the other two that @xmath146 is in fact a strongly increasing function of @xmath132 .",
    "this is indeed what was also found in the su(2 ) case @xcite .",
    "moreover , the order of magnitude of @xmath139 , @xmath140 agrees with what was found in the su(2 ) case .",
    "this thus suggests that also in the su(5 ) case , bound multimonopoles only exist for sufficiently small values of the higgs self - coupling constants .",
    "for the numerical construction of non - abelian black holes , we followed @xcite and introduced new metric functions @xmath150 , @xmath151 and @xmath152 @xmath153 where @xmath154 is the compactified coordinate that maps the infinite interval @xmath155 to the finite interval @xmath156 $ ] .",
    "the new boundary conditions at the horizon @xmath157 now read @xcite : @xmath158 the isotropic horizon @xmath157 is not a physical quantity .",
    "we thus determine for every solution obtained the parameter @xmath159 given by : @xmath160 @xmath161 is the area of the horizon and directly related to the entropy @xmath162 of the black hole : @xmath163 .",
    "note that the schwarzschild - like horizon @xmath164 is exactly defind to be the radius of the horizon with area @xmath161 .",
    "spherically symmetric black hole solutions can be constructed for @xmath10 .",
    "similarly as in the case of regular solutions they have @xmath165 , @xmath166 , @xmath61=@xmath63=@xmath167 and all remaining functions depend only on @xmath110 .",
    "in fact the non - abelian black hole solutions can equally well be constructed using the ansatz of the schwarschild - like metric .",
    "the boundary conditions are then directly imposed at @xmath168 .",
    "we find that the domain of existence of the spherically symmetric non - abelian black holes in the @xmath132-@xmath159-plane is of similar shape than the domain of existence in the su(2 ) @xcite and in the su(3 ) @xcite case , respectively .",
    "fixing @xmath132 and increasing @xmath159 , the non - abelian solutions exist for @xmath169 and at @xmath170 bifurcate with the branch of non - extremal reissner - nordstrm ( rn ) solution for small @xmath132 and with the branch of extremal reissner - nordstrm ( rn ) solution for large @xmath132 , respectively . in this paper , we put emphasis on the case @xmath171 , @xmath98 , for which the solutions bifurcate with the branch of non - extremal rn solutions . for @xmath172",
    "the bifurcation occurs on a second branch of solutions which exists for @xmath173 , i.e. that in this interval two different black hole solutions can be constructed . for @xmath174",
    "sufficiently large only one branch of solutions exists and @xmath175 .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig . 5 for @xmath10 and @xmath172 , resp .",
    "we show the energy @xmath177 of the non - abelian solutions and that of the corresponding rn solutions .",
    "the occurence of a second branch of solutions for @xmath172 is apparent from this figure with @xmath178 and @xmath179 . for @xmath176",
    "only one branch of solutions exists and we find that @xmath180 .    a good indication for the bifurcation with the branch of non - extremal rn solutions is the fact that in the limit @xmath181 the values of the matter fields at the horizon tend to their asymptotic values .",
    "since these functions are monotonic functions of @xmath110 , they obviously become constant on the whole interval @xmath182 in the critical limit .",
    "we demonstrate this in fig . 6 for @xmath183 and @xmath184 , @xmath185 .",
    "the value of the gauge function at the horizon , @xmath183 , tends to zero , while the values of the three higgs field function at the horizon , @xmath184 , approach their respective asymptotic values ( see ( [ higgs ] ) ) .      in the su(2 ) case , it was found @xcite that the critical values of the horizon parameter @xmath159 increase with increasing @xmath11 .",
    "however , it was also shown that the qualitative shape of the domain of existence does nt change .",
    "we observe the same for the su(5 ) case .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig . 5 , where we shown together with the energy of the @xmath10 solutions the energy @xmath186 of the axially symmetric black hole solutions for two different values of @xmath187 . clearly",
    ", the solutions exist for higher values of @xmath159 .",
    "we find for @xmath91 that @xmath188 and @xmath189 , while for @xmath190 , we have @xmath191 . indeed",
    ", this figure demonstrates again the occurence of a second branch of solutions for @xmath91 , while for @xmath190 only one branch of non - abelian black hole solutions exists .    as an indication of the deformation of the horizon , which is defined to be the surface of constant @xmath157",
    ", we have computed the circumference of the horizon along the equator @xmath192 @xmath193 and the circumference of the horizon along the poles @xmath194 : @xmath195 it is apparent that the ratio @xmath196 is equal to one for the spherically symmetric solutions since @xmath197 for @xmath10 and the angle dependence disappears . for the axially symmetric solutions",
    ", however , the ratio deviades from one .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "7 , where we show @xmath196 as function of @xmath159 for the @xmath119 non - abelian black hole with @xmath198 , @xmath98 .",
    "the case @xmath187 is the analog of what was studied in the su(2 ) case for @xmath199 .",
    "the ratio reaches a minimum at a value of @xmath159 close to the maximal @xmath159 , then on the second branch of solutions reaches a maximal value which is bigger than one and then drops down to one at @xmath200 . for non - vanishing higgs coupling constants",
    "( we have chosen @xmath190 ) , the apparent effect is the decrease of the minimal and the increase of the maximal value of @xmath196 .",
    "thus the inclusion of the higgs potential increases the deformation of the regular horizon of the non - abelian black holes .",
    "the qualitative feature changes in the sense that now no second branch of solutions exists and thus the local extrema of the curve are reached for @xmath201 .",
    "moreover , we observe a sharp drop of the ratio from its maximal value to the value one at @xmath202 .",
    "7 leads us further to the conclusion that the observation of two local extrema ( a minimum and a maximum ) for the ratio @xmath196 seems a generic feature for all higgs coupling constants as long as the critical solutions into which the non - abelian black holes merge at @xmath202 are non - extremal reissner - nordstrm solutions .",
    "since it is believed that monopoles have formed in the early universe through the spontaneous symmetry breakdown of a grand unified theory ( gut ) down to a gauge group containing a @xmath203 subgroup , the study of monopoles arising in su(5 ) yang - mills - higgs theory which ( through an appropriate potential ) is spontaneously broken down to @xmath204 seems of importance .",
    "we have thus studied spherically as well as axially symmetric solutions in su(5 ) yang - mills - higgs theory both in flat and curved space . concerning the globally regular solutions",
    ", we find that in flat space very similar to the corresponding solutions in su(2 ) yang - mills - higgs theory , the monopoles are either non - interacting or repelling .",
    "moreover , we find that the order of magnitude of the mass in the limit of the higgs self - coupling constants going to infinity agrees with the su(2 ) results . minimal coupling of gravity to the system leads in principle to two different types of non - abelian solutions : a ) globally regular , gravitating monopoles and b ) non - abelian black holes .",
    "we find that the qualitative features like the appearance of a second branch of solutions for small higgs self - coupling constants or the appearance of a new phenomenon for intermediate values of the higgs self - coupling constants are also found in this system .",
    "since these phenomena have also been observed for spherically symmetric solutions in su(3 ) einstein - yang - mills - higgs theory ( eymh ) @xcite , it is likely that what was observed in su(2 ) seems to be a generic feature of su(n ) eymh theory with the higgs field in the adjoint representation .",
    "we also studied spherically and axially symmetric non - abelian black holes solutions .",
    "the corresponding solutions for the su(2 ) gauge group were studied in great detail in @xcite for vanishing higgs coupling constant ( bps limit ) .",
    "it seems , however , that the  physically \" relevant solutions related to su(5 ) have to be constructed for non - vanishing values of the higgs self - coupling constants @xmath102 , @xmath103 .",
    "that s why we have put emphasis on the influence of a non - trivial higgs potential on the solutions .",
    "of course , the problem is numerically involved since the equations have to be solved for four continuous parameters : @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath132 and @xmath157 .",
    "in addition there is a discrete parameter , namely the winding number @xmath11 .",
    "nevertheless , we have tried to determine the main features of the influence of the potential on the solutions .",
    "we find that : ( i ) the parameters @xmath205 and @xmath103 effect in a non negligible way the domain of existence in the @xmath132-@xmath159-plane , ( ii ) for @xmath102 , @xmath103 large enough , the solutions bifurcate into a non - extremal reissner - nordstrm solution on the first branch of solutions without a backbending in the parameter @xmath159 , ( iii ) the deformation of the horizon of the axially symmetric black hole solutions increases for @xmath102 , @xmath206 , ( iv ) the surface gravity - at least for small values of @xmath102 , @xmath103 - depends only weakly on @xmath102 , @xmath103 .",
