    "wireless network receivers should cope with interference from undesired transmitters in addition to the ambient noise , and hence , there is a rising interest in using advanced interference mitigation techniques to improve the network performance .",
    "ia is one of the latest strategies to deal with interference .",
    "this technique was first introduced by maddah ali et .",
    "al . @xcite .",
    "the idea of interference alignment ( ia ) is to coordinate multiple transmitters so that their mutual interference aligns at the receivers , facilitating simple interference cancellation techniques .",
    "the original method proposed in @xcite was iterative and nonlinear , the linear and closed form approach was introduced by jafar and shamai @xcite .",
    "the majority of ia schemes fall into one of two categories of signal space alignment and signal level alignment .",
    "our main focus in this paper is on signal space alignment schemes . using infinite dimensional extension of the channel",
    ", it is shown that ia could achieve the optimal dof of @xmath1 in k - pair single antenna ergodic interference channels @xcite .",
    "the idea of ia has been successfully applied to various interference networks .",
    "ergodic ia ( eia ) scheme is proposed by nazer et al .",
    "this scheme aims to achieve @xmath2 interference - free ergodic capacity of interference channel ( ifc ) at any signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the order of channel extensions needed by @xcite is roughly the same as @xcite .",
    "the similar idea of opportunistically pairing two channel instances to cancel interference has been proposed independently by @xcite as well .",
    "however , eia scheme is based on an special pairing of the channel matrices and does not address the general structure of the paired channels suitable for cancelling interference .",
    "assuming linear combining of paired channel output signals , this paper addresses the general necessary and sufficient structure of channel matrices which are suitable to be paired to cancel interference . using this general pairing scheme ,",
    "a new ia scheme is proposed which significantly reduces the number of channel extensions needed to perfectly align interference .    from a different standpoint",
    ", this paper obtains the necessary and sufficient feasibility conditions on channel structure to achieve total dof of the ifc using limited number of channel extension .",
    "so far , ia feasibility literature have mainly focused on network configuration , see @xcite and references therein . to ease some of ia criteria by using channel structure ,",
    "@xcite investigates degrees of freedom for the partially connected ifcs where some arbitrary interfering links are assumed disconnected . in this channel model , @xcite examines how these disconnected links are considered on designing the beamforming vectors for ia and closed - form solutions are obtained for some specific configurations .",
    "in contrast , our work evaluates the necessary and sufficient conditions on channel structure of an ifc to make perfect ia possible with limited number of channel extensions . an earlier version of this paper have been reported in @xcite .",

    "an example of the proposed method application is presented in section @xmath5 . in section @xmath6 ,",
