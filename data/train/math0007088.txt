    "let @xmath2 be a knot in @xmath4 .",
    "if @xmath5 is a seifert surface for @xmath2 there is a seifert form , @xmath6 , defined on @xmath7 .",
    "the knot @xmath2 is called _ algebraically slice _ if @xmath6 vanishes on some half  dimensional summand of @xmath7 ; such a summand is called a _ metabolizer _ for @xmath6 .",
    "if @xmath2 is _ slice _ , that is , if it bounds a smooth embedded disk in @xmath8 , then it is algebraically slice .",
    "casson and gordon @xcite proved that the converse does not hold by constructing explicit examples of algebraically slice knots that are not slice .",
    "( this was in contrast to the result proved by levine @xcite that in higher dimensions the analagous condition of algebraic sliceness does imply that a knot is slice . )",
    "if a basis for the metabolizer in @xmath7 is represented by a stongly slice link , one for which the components bound disjoint disks in @xmath8 , then it is easily shown that @xmath2 is slice .",
    "the question has been asked whether it is sufficient to show that a basis of the metabolizer is represented by slice knots to assure that @xmath2 will be slice . here",
    "we provide a genus two counterexample to show this is not the case .",
    "litherland has previously given such an example in @xcite , but that paper never appeared , and the result depended on the development of a lengthy algorithm for computing casson  gordon invariants ; that algorithm itself has not appeared in print .",
    "the example here points to a much deeper question regarding classical concordance . at an empirical level , knotting in the curves representing elements in the metabolizer of the seifert form present secondary obstructions to slicing a classical knot",
    "this was first made formal in gilmer s work @xcite where certain signatures of these knots were related to casson - gordon invariants . in the case we are considering these signatures all vanish , and hence a more subtle approach is needed .",
    "it is expected that in addition to the signatures of the individual components of the metabolizing basis there should be abelian invariants of the entire link that provide second order slicing obstructions .",
    "the example produced here points to the existance of such obstructions , but the precise formulation is not evident and remains an open question .",
    "the results of this paper depend only on the original definition of casson  gordon invariants of @xcite , the connected sum formula of gilmer @xcite , and a simple method for computing casson  gordon invariants of satellite knots , first described in @xcite and reformulated in @xcite as needed here .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite for basic results in knot theory .",
    "we will work in the smooth category , but all results extend to the topological , locally flat , category by @xcite .",
    "the example presented here was developed in response to a question of effie kalfagianni addressed to the author .",
    "we also wish to thank pat gilmer for conversations regarding this work .",
    "let @xmath2 be a knot in @xmath4 with 2fold branched cover @xmath9 . for a character @xmath10 , casson and gordon @xcite",
    "define an invariant , denoted @xmath11 . to simplify notation we have :    @xmath12 .",
    "there is a linking form lk:@xmath13 .",
    "the main result of @xcite is the following .",
    "if @xmath2 is slice there is a subgroup @xmath14 with @xmath15 and such that for any character @xmath16 with values in @xmath17 for prime @xmath18 that vanishes on @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "furthermore @xmath19 can be assumed to be a metabolizer ( self  annihilating ) for the linking form on @xmath21 .",
    "one simple result concerning the casson ",
    "gordon invariant is that @xmath22 .",
    "a much deeper result is the additivity result proved by gilmer @xcite , as we now describe . if @xmath23 , then @xmath24 and any character @xmath16 on @xmath25 can be written as @xmath26 with @xmath27 a character on @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29 .    for satellite knots",
    "there is an algorithm that simplifies the computation of its casson  gordon invariants .",
    "details appear in @xcite ; here is a summary .",
    "suppose that @xmath30 is an unknotted circle in @xmath4 in the complement of @xmath2 that is null homologous in @xmath31 .",
    "if a neighborood of @xmath30 is removed from @xmath4 and replaced with the complement of a knotted circle @xmath32 in @xmath4 ( with the boundaries identified so that the longitude of @xmath30 is identified with the meridian of @xmath32 and the meridian of @xmath30 is identified with the longitude of @xmath32 ) then the resulting manifold is diffeomorphic to @xmath4 , but the curve @xmath2 now represents a perhaps different knot , say @xmath33 , in @xmath4 .",
    "( traditionally @xmath33 has been called a satellite of @xmath32 with embellishment @xmath2 ; in effect the portion of @xmath2 that passes through @xmath30 is tied into the knot @xmath32 . )    the curve @xmath30 lifts to a pair of curves , @xmath34 and @xmath35 in @xmath9 .",
    "thus , @xmath36 is constructed from @xmath37 by removing neighborhoods of @xmath34 and @xmath35 and replacing both with copies of the complement of @xmath32 .",
    "this construction leaves the homology unchanged and there is a natural correspondence between the homology , and cohomology , groups of @xmath37 and @xmath36 .",
    "in particular we can identify a characters @xmath16 on @xmath38 with characters on @xmath39 .",
    "in this situation we have the following :    [ surgeryformula ] @xmath40 .    here",
    "@xmath41 denotes the classical tristram - levine signature @xcite of the knot @xmath32 , given as the signature of the hermetianized seifert form @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "a similar result holds if @xmath30 is replaced with a nullhomologous unlink in the complement of @xmath2 , with the single signature in theorem [ surgeryformula ] replaced with a sum of signatures .",
    "in this section we construct an example of a genus two knot , @xmath33 , that is algebraically slice and for which a generating set for a metabolizer of a seifert form can be represented by slice knots , and yet the knot itself is not slice .            the example is illustrated in figure 1 . in the figure , a knot @xmath2 is drawn along with five curves in the complement of its seifert surface , @xmath44 .",
    "the bands are twisted in such a way that the seifert form for this knot is given by @xmath45 the knot @xmath33 is constructed by removing neighborhoods of the @xmath46 and replacing them with knot complements . in our case",
    "all of these will be the complement of the same knot , @xmath32 , with the exception of @xmath47 which is replaced with the complement of @xmath48 .",
    "let @xmath49 denote the standard symplectic basis for the first homology of the seifert surface for @xmath33 ( as drawn above ) and at the same time denote obvious simple curves on the seifert surface representing these classes .",
    "( so , each curve passes over exactly one band , with @xmath50 going around the leftmost band . )",
    "notice that , as knots , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are each the knot @xmath32 , while @xmath52 and @xmath53 are each represented by the slice knot @xmath54 .",
    "in particular , @xmath52 and @xmath53 form a basis for a metabolizer for the seifert form with both elements represented by slice knots .",
    "that this knot provides the desired examples follows from the following theorem .",
    "to prove this result , we begin with a diagram of the 2-fold branched cover of @xmath4 branched over @xmath33 as drawn in figure 2 using the algorithm of @xcite . in this figure the lifts of the @xmath46 are drawn , and are to be replaced with the appropriate knot complement ( of either @xmath32 or @xmath48 ) to complete the construction .",
    "the homology of the cover is @xmath57 generated by meridians to the four surgery circles .",
    "denote by @xmath58 the @xmath59 valued character taking values @xmath60 , and @xmath61 on the four meridians , listed as drawn from left to right , respectively . by choosing the orientations of the @xmath62 properly",
    ", we can assume that :    * @xmath63 takes value 1 on @xmath64 and value 0 on all other @xmath65 .",
    "* @xmath66 takes value 1 on @xmath67 and @xmath68 and value 0 on all other @xmath65 . *",
    "@xmath69 takes value 1 on @xmath70 and @xmath68 and value 0 on all other @xmath65 .",
    "* @xmath71 takes value 1 on @xmath72 and value 0 on all other @xmath65 .",
    "since the set of values of @xmath79 represents a fixed finite set of rational numbers , it is bounded above in absolute value by some number @xmath80 .",
    "it is clear that if we can prove that for every possible metabolizer the value of @xmath81 is positive for some character vanishing on the metabolizer , then if @xmath82 the corresponding casson ",
    "gordon invariant is nonzero .",
    "it is easily seen that for all @xmath83 and @xmath84 , @xmath85 . hence , @xmath81 will be positive unless both @xmath86 and @xmath61 are 0 .",
    "but if this were the case for all characters vanishing on the metabolizer , then this set of characters would necessarily be spanned by the characters @xmath66 and @xmath69 .",
    "but then the set of characters would also contain @xmath87 , and for this character @xmath88 .",
    "we have now seen that for every metabolizer there is some character vanishing on that metabolizer for which @xmath89 . since @xmath90 and @xmath82",
    ", it certainly follows that for this character @xmath91 and the proof is complete ."
