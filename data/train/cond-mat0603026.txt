    "the competition between rkky interaction and kondo effect is recognized as the fundamental mechanism to explain several properties of @xmath12 and @xmath13 compounds .",
    "nevertheless , there are also strong experimental evidences that the presence of disorder in those compounds can be source of quite novel effects @xcite . for instance",
    ", deviations of the fermi - liquid ( fl ) behavior are observed in the magnetic , thermodynamic and transport properties .",
    "recently , theories have been proposed to explain how disorder can produce such deviations @xcite .",
    "however , it is still not clear whether disorder itself can be the origin of such deviations .",
    "other prospective has adopted the proximity to a qcp @xcite as a possible origin of the non - fermi liquid ( nfl ) behavior .",
    "besides this complicate scenario with nfl behavior , some of these physical systems present a highly non - trivial manifestation of disorder which is frustration . as consequence , there are many phase diagrams with ferromagnetism ( fm ) , antiferromagnetism ( af ) , spin glass ( sg ) and a kondo state with the complete screening of the localized spins .",
    "this raises the question of whether it is possible to build up theories able to account for those phase diagrams .    the experimental situation of ce and u alloys which present together a spin glass phase , an antiferromagnetic one and",
    "finally a kondo one is complicate , especially when the phase changes occur with changing the matrix composition of the alloy .",
    "moreover , there is certainly an important local effect in the spin glass , as recently evidenced by local measurements in @xmath14 alloys @xcite . in particular",
    ", there is a change from af to kondo and then to sg with increasing @xmath11 in @xmath15 @xcite and a different situation in @xmath10 alloys @xcite . more precisely , in the case of @xmath10 alloys ,",
    "the glassy behaviour is not favored when the chemical induced disorder is initially increased . in the experimental phase diagram , for @xmath16 and low temperature , a spin glass - like state appears .",
    "when the @xmath17 doping is increasead , the system experiments a transition to an af phase . in the interval @xmath18 , the neel temperature @xmath19 decreases until reaching a qcp at @xmath20 with no trace of nfl behavior . for @xmath21 , the magnetic moments are supressed due to the kondo effect .    recently",
    ", a theoretical approach @xcite has attempted to describe the interplay between af and sg in a kondo lattice using the same framework previously introduced to study the sg in the kondo lattice @xcite .",
    "the proposed model has been a two - kondo sublattice with an intrasite exchange interation with strength @xmath0 and a random gaussian @xmath22 intersite interaction only between distinct sublattices .",
    "two quite important points are introduced in this approach .",
    "the first one is that there is no hopping of conduction electrons between distinct sublattices .",
    "therefore , the antiferromagnetic solutions in this model are entirely associated to the coupling among localized magnetic moments .",
    "the second one takes the relationship @xmath23 , because the two exchange terms can not be considered as completely independent from each other @xcite . as a consequence , when the strength of the intrasite exchange interaction @xmath0 increases ( in units of @xmath24 ) , the degree of frustration @xmath25 decreases",
    "this last parameter controls the emergence of sg or af solutions in the problem .",
    "the results have been shown in a phase diagram @xmath26 ( @xmath27 is the temperature ) _ versus _ @xmath9 . for small @xmath9 and low temperature ,",
    "there is a sg phase .",
    "when @xmath9 is increased , an af solution has been found .",
    "finally , for @xmath28 , the kondo state becomes dominant .",
    "thus , we can conclude from the previous calculation @xcite that the sequence of phases sg , af and kondo mimics qualitatively the experimental phase diagram of @xmath10 if @xmath9 is associated with the content of @xmath17 .",
    "but , we can say that the previous agreement was only qualitative to provide the correct sequence of phases for the alloys @xmath10 @xcite , because in the previous approach there is no mechanism able to produce a qcp . as a consequence",
    ", this approach can not provide the proper behavior of the neel temperature which should decrease towards a qcp .",
    "thus , the purpose of the present paper is to obtain specifically a quantitative description of the phase diagram of @xmath10 alloys and in particular of the qcp , by adding a quantum mechanism to produce spin flipping , given by an additional transverse field @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "we take here the replica symmetry mean - field approximation and we use the static approximation .",
    "indeed , such an approximation is subject to criticism , but it was shown in many previous works that it yields a good description of the competition between the kondo effect and magnetism in the kondo lattice models .",
    "moreover , the quantum ising spin glass in a transverse field has the same critical behavior as the @xmath29-component quantum rotor which is exactly solvable in the @xmath30 limit @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the line transition is given by the singularity of the zero - frequency that is equivalent to the static approximation .",
    "the static approximation is , therefore , relatively well justified for the study of phase boundaries , which is really the purpose of our paper in the specific case of the sg - af - kondo competition in alloys such as @xmath10 .",
    "then , we will assume a relationship @xmath31 ; this choice , which has been already used in references @xcite , is taken to account for the fact that the intrasite exchange interaction is able to produce both the kondo effect and the rkky interaction .",
    "the transverse field plays a role similar to the spin flipping part of the heisenberg model .",
    "one of the main achievements of this approach has been to show the presence of a qcp in the competition between sg and the kondo state when @xmath1 is enhanced and to improve , therefore , considerably the description of experimental results .    in this paper , we study the sg - af competition in the disordered kondo lattice , described by the hopping of the conduction electrons only inside each sublattice , an intersite exchange interaction , given by an ising - like term only between different sublattices and a transverse field @xmath1 applied in the @xmath11-direction , in order to obtain a mechanism able to produce a qcp .",
    "we use also the static approximation and the relationships @xmath32 and @xmath31 already introduced in references @xcite .",
    "therefore , the initial many parameters problem is reduced to a one parameter which allows a better comparison with experimental results .",
    "the comparison of our theoretical results to experimental data is delicate for two reasons .",
    "first , as we have just discussed , we take a @xmath33-dependence of both @xmath34 and @xmath1 , which is clearly a crude approximation but which has already given interesting physical results in reference @xcite .",
    "then , the second question concerns the fact that @xmath0 is assumed to increase with the concentration of cobalt in @xmath10 alloys , as previously done with the concentration of nickel in @xmath14 alloys .",
    "indeed , the role of the so - called `` chemical pressure '' is less clear than that of the regular pressure , but obviously the spin glass phase originates in such alloys only from the disorder of the matrix and we are obliged to make an assumption of the relationship between @xmath0 and the relative host concentration x , which was previously successful in the case of @xmath14 alloys reference @xcite .",
    "this question is in fact not easy to answer theoretically .    in section 2",
    ", we introduce the model and the relevant order parameters for the problem . the saddle point free energy in terms of the order parameters",
    "is obtained so that it allows to obtain a phase diagram giving temperature @xmath26 _ versus _ @xmath9 .",
    "the results and the final discussion are presented in the last section .",
    "we have considered in this work a model given by two kondo sublattices @xmath35 and @xmath36 with a random coupling @xmath22 only between localized spins in distinct sublattices @xcite .",
    "there is also a transverse field @xmath1 coupled with the localized spins in both sublattices @xcite .",
    "as mentioned in section 1 , the hopping of conduction electrons between two different sublattices is not allowed for simplicity .",
    "therefore , the hamiltonian is : @xmath37 + \\sum_{i , j }",
    "j_{i j}\\hat{s}_{i , a}^{z}\\hat{s}_{j , b}^{z}+2\\gamma\\sum_{i } ( \\hat{s}_{i , a}^{x}+\\hat{s}_{i , b}^{x})~~ \\label{e1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 and @xmath39 sums are over @xmath40 sites of each sublattice .",

    "this mixed phase represents a replica symmetry breaking sg phase with non - zero spontaneous sublattice magnetization .",
    "finally , at @xmath122 there is a transition to a pure sg phase . for increasing @xmath9 , a kondo solution at @xmath126",

    "however , to compare the results obtained in this work with the experimental results , it is better to reduce the number of parameters which are in fact not independent from each other , because both the kondo effect and the rkky can be generated directly from the intrasite exchange interaction .",
    "thus , we choose a relationship among the parameters @xmath105 , @xmath9 and @xmath106 , similar to that used in ref .",
    "@xcite where a relationship @xmath23 has successfully reproduced the experimental sequence of phases . nevertheless , in ref .",

    "in the present work , the transverse field @xmath1 has been introduced to provide a simple mechanism able to reproduce the spin flipping part of the heisenberg model @xcite .",

    "it should be remarked that this choice introduces an additional complexity .",

    "figure 2.b shows the presence of the sg solution in which @xmath142 and @xmath143 coincide .",
    "then , in a very small interval of @xmath115 , @xmath144",
    ". therefore , the mixed phase af+sg appears after the sg phase .",
    "finally , in the interval @xmath145 , only the af solution is present .",
    "when @xmath9 increases , the neel temperature decreases until a qcp . above this point",
    "onwards , there is a transition line to the kondo state characterized by @xmath146 @xcite .",
    "at high temperature , the solutions of the order parameters are @xmath147 , @xmath148 and @xmath149 ( @xmath104 , @xmath36 ) .    the situation described in the present replica symmetry mean field theory",
    "can be analysed as follows : for a low @xmath9 value ( corresponding to high value of @xmath25 ) , frustration is dominant and the long range internal field is given by the sg component of @xmath96 ( see eq .",
    "( [ internalfield ] ) ) .",
    "when @xmath9 is increased , the degree of frustration @xmath25 is decreased and , therefore , the localized spin of the sublattice @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) starts to couple with an internal field which depends on the negative magnetization of the sublattice @xmath36 ( @xmath35 ) in the af ordering @xcite .",
    "however , this process also implies the increase of the transverse field @xmath1 and consequently the freezing temperature ( @xmath122 ) is slightly decreasing . on the other hand ,",
    "the neel temperature ( @xmath19 ) is deeply affected and decreases towards a qcp .",
    "finally , for enough high @xmath9 , there is complete dominance of the kondo effect @xcite . finally , as we have already explained in the introduction , the comparison between theory and experiment is more delicated in the case of disordered alloys where the different phases occur as a function of the relative matrix concentration than in the classical case where increasing pressure makes @xmath0 increase .",
    "but here we consider that @xmath0 increases with increasing @xmath17 concentration , as we have successfully assumed that @xmath0 increases with increasing @xmath150 concentration in the case of @xmath14 alloys reference @xcite . under this assumption ,",
    "the theoretical results given in figure 2.b agree quite well with the experimental phase diagram of @xmath10 alloys @xcite ( see figure 2.a ) and in particular we obtain the same order for the sequence of phases and , mainly , the correct behavior of the neel temperature .    to conclude , we have used a two - sublattice model with two exchange interactions , an intrasite exchange and a random intersite between localized ising spins in the presence of transverse field .",
    "the main goal of the present work has been to reproduce some fundamental aspects of the phase boundary contained in the experimental phase diagram of the @xmath10 alloys @xcite .",
    "finally , the theoretical results shown in figure 2.b account quite well for the most important part of the experimental phase diagram of @xmath10 alloys @xcite with the cobalt concentration ( figure 2.a ) and the agreement between the two figures shows a clear improvement performed by the present model with respect to previous ones .",
    "in fact , important questions are not really solved , such as for example the different possible kondo - af - sg sequences found in different disordered alloys , the relationship between the parameters of the model and the matrix concentration which is certainly less clear than the pressure dependence and finally the precise local nature of the spin glass phase .",
    "further work will be , therefore , necessary to improve the theoretical description and to obtain new phase diagrams of @xmath12 or @xmath13 alloys or compounds with either the matrix concentration or the external pressure .",
