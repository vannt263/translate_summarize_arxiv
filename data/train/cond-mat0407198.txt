    "the behavior of a nonlinear dynamical system is strongly modified when randomness is taken into account : noise can shift bifurcation thresholds , create new phases ( noise - induced transitions ) , or even generate spatial patterns @xcite . the interplay of noise with nonlinearity gives rise to a variety of phenomena that constantly motivate new research of theoretical and practical significance .",
    "stochastic resonance @xcite and biomolecular brownian motors @xcite are celebrated examples of nonlinear random systems of current interest . in particular , stochastic ratchets have generated a renewed interest in the study of simple mechanical systems subject to random interactions , the common ancestor of such models being langevin s description of brownian motion .",
    "many unexpected phenomena appear when one generalizes langevin s equations to include , _",
    "e.g. _ , inertial terms , nonlinearities , external ( multiplicative ) noise or noise with finite correlation time ; each of these new features opens a field of investigations that calls for specific techniques or approximation schemes @xcite .",
    "nonlinear oscillators with parametric noise are often used as paradigms for the study of these various effects and related mathematical methods @xcite .",
    "the advantage of such models is that they have an appealing physical interpretation and appear as building blocks in many different fields ; they can be simulated on a computer or constructed as real electronic or mechanical systems @xcite .",
    "moreover , the mathematical apparatus needed to analyze them remains relatively elementary ( as compared to the perturbative field - theoretical methods required for spatio - temporal systems @xcite ) and can be expected to yield exact and rigorous results .    in the present work",
    ", we study the motion of a frictionless pendulum with parametric noise , which can be physically interpreted as a randomly vibrating suspension axis .",
    "we show that the long time behavior of a stochastic pendulum driven by a colored noise _ with finite correlation time _ is drastically different from that of a pendulum subject to white noise . whereas the average energy of the white - noise pendulum is a linear function of time , that of the colored - noise pendulum grows only as the the square - root of time .",
    "our analysis is based on a generalization of the averaging technique that we have used previouly for nonlinear oscillators subject to white noise : in @xcite an effective dynamics for the action variable of the system is derived after integrating out the fast angular variable , and is then exactly solved . however , this averaging technique as such ceases to apply to systems with colored noise when the time scale of the fast variable becomes smaller than the correlation time of the noise .",
    "correlations between the fast variable and the noise modify the long time scaling behavior of the system and therefore must be taken into account .",
    "we shall develop here a method that systematically retains these correlation terms before the fast variable is averaged out .",
    "this will allow us to derive analytical expressions for the asymptotic probability distribution function ( p.d.f . ) of the energy of the stochastic pendulum , and to deduce the long time behavior of the system .",
    "our analytical results are verified by numerical simulations .",
    "finally , we shall compare our method and results with some known approximation schemes used for multivariate systems with colored noise .",
    "we shall show in particular that small correlation time expansions can not explain the anomalous diffusion exponent when truncated at any finite order .",
    "the partial summation of fokker - planck type terms , used to derive a ` best effective fokker - planck equation ' for colored noise @xcite leads to results that agree with ours .",

    "is derived from a second - order cumulant expansion in which higher order terms , that are not fokker - planck - like , are discarded .",
    "this approximation has been criticized @xcite because the neglected higher - derivative terms can be of the same order as the terms that have been retained in the b.f.p.e . however , for the stochastic pendulum , these neglected terms do not change qualitatively the large time behavior of the dynamical variables .",
    "in contrast , the averaging technique that we have generalized here is not based on any _ a priori _ expansion and provides reliable results at least for the stochastic system studied in this work . of course",
    ", the approach advocated here has been developed for one particular problem and does not have the generality and versatility of effective fokker - planck methods .",
    "nevertheless , we strongly believe that the recursive averaging scheme developed here for the stochastic pendulum can be extended to other nonlinear one - dimensional systems subject to multiplicative or additive colored noise @xcite .",
    "a nonlinear pendulum subject to parametric noise undergoes a noise - induced diffusion in phase space .",
    "the characteristics of this motion depend on the nature of the randomness : when the noise is white the energy of the pendulum grows linearly with time , whereas it varies only as the square root of time when the noise is colored .",
    "this change of behavior is due to destructive interference between the displacement of the pendulum and the noise term : the effect of the colored noise is partially averaged out by fast angular variations as soon as the period of the pendulum becomes smaller than the correlation time @xmath40 of the noise .",
    "we have carried out an analytical study of this model by defining recursively new coordinates in the phase space and averaging out the fast angular variable . at zeroth order ,",
    "the only information obtained is that the motion is subdiffusive ; at first order , this procedure provides the correct scalings ; at second order , a quantitative agreement with numerical simulations is reached .",
    "we emphasize that our method is different from the usual approximations that involve effective fokker - planck equations in which the colored noise does not appear as an auxiliary variable .",
    "our averaging procedure integrates out the fast dynamical variable and leads to an effective stochastic dynamics for the slow variables with colored noise .",
    "whereas usual effective fokker - planck equations are valid only for small noise and for short correlation times , we do not make any hypothesis on the amplitude of the noise or on the correlation time @xmath40 .",
    "however , the asymptotic subdiffusive regime is reached earlier for larger values of @xmath40 .",
    "our results agree with those derived after averaging the ` best fokker - planck equation ' ( b.f.p.e . )",
    "approximation ( which is obtained from a summation of a truncated cumulant expansion of the liouville equation ) .",
    "this approximation is also useful to draw a qualitative physical picture of the system and allows to calculate approximate crossover functions between short time ( white noise ) and long time ( colored noise ) regimes .",
    "the recursive averaging scheme that we have used here for the stochastic pendulum can be extended to other systems coupled with colored noise .",
    "in particular , we believe that thanks to this method a precise mathematical analysis of the long time behavior of a nonlinear oscillator subject to multiplicative or additive colored noise can be carried out @xcite .",
    "we thank s. mallick for his helpful comments on the manuscript and f. moulay for useful discussions .",
    "in this appendix , we derive the b.f.p.e . ( eq .  ( [ bfpe ] ) ) following the procedure of @xcite .",
    "we evaluate the right hand side of eq .",
