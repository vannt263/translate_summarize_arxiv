    "the main result of this manuscript is an explicit combinatorial computation of the chen - ruan orbifold cohomology @xmath2 @xcite of an orbifold hypertoric variety @xmath3 .",
    "hypertoric varieties are hyperkhler analogues of toric varieties , and were first introduced by bielawski and dancer @xcite , and further studied by konno @xcite , @xcite and hausel and sturmfels @xcite , among others . just as a symplectic toric orbifold",
    "is determined by a labelled polytope , the theory of orbifold hypertoric varieties is intimately related to the combinatorial data of a related rational cooriented hyperplane arrangement @xmath1 .",
    "our description of @xmath2 is given purely in terms of this arrangement @xmath1 .",
    "the fact that these hypertoric varieties are constructed as hyperkhler quotients @xmath0 of a quaternionic affine space @xmath4 ( via the hyperkhler analogue of the delzant construction of khler toric varieties ) is crucial to our techniques .",
    "hyperkhler quotients appear in many areas of mathematics .",
    "for instance , in representation theory , nakajima s quiver varieties give rise to geometric models of representations ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . furthermore , many moduli spaces appearing in physics , such as spaces of yang - mills instantons on @xmath5-manifolds or the solutions to the yang - mills - higgs equations on a riemann surface , arise via hyperkhler quotient constructions . in each case , the study of topological invariants , such as cohomology rings or @xmath6-theory , of these quotients are of interest . in the case of hypertoric varieties , there are also close connections between the ( ordinary or borel - equivariant ) cohomology rings of the varieties and the combinatorial theory of the corresponding hyperplane arrangements @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "generalizing known such results to the orbifold case is of current interest .",
    "for example , recent work of proudfoot and webster @xcite[section 6 ] on the intersection cohomology of singular hypertoric varieties and the cohomology of their orbifold resolutions contains cohomological formulas which only apply in the unimodular case ; it would be of interest to know whether there are orbifold versions of their statements .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on the combinatorics of the hyperplane arrangement associated to the * chen - ruan orbifold cohomology * of orbifold hypertoric varieties .",
    "chen - ruan orbifold cohomology rings were introduced in @xcite as the degree @xmath7 piece of the gromov - witten theory of an orbifold , following work in physics @xcite .",
    "this ring carries , in addition to the data of the usual singular cohomology ring of the underlying space , more delicate information ( e.g. about the orbifold structure groups ) .",
    "additively , @xmath2 is simply the usual singular cohomology of the inertia orbifold @xmath8 associated to @xmath3 ; the product structure , on the other hand , is much more subtle , incorporating the data of higher twisted sectors . in this manuscript",
    ", we provide an explicit presentation , via generators and relations , of this chen - ruan cohomology ring for a class of orbifold hypertoric varieties .",
    "our approach is to develop hyperkhler analogues of the symplectic - geometric techniques as introduced by goldin , holm , and knutson in @xcite to compute chen - ruan orbifold cohomology . as in their work , we take advantage of the fact that a hypertoric variety is by construction a global quotient of a manifold by a torus .",
    "we now briefly recall the main results of @xcite .",
    "let @xmath9 be a compact connected torus , let @xmath10 be a compact hamiltonian @xmath9-manifold moment map @xmath11 , and suppose that @xmath12 is a regular value of @xmath13 .",
    "then the inclusion @xmath14 induces a natural ring homomorphism , often called the * kirwan map * : @xmath15 which is a surjection @xcite . here",
    "@xmath16 is by definition the symplectic quotient of @xmath10 at @xmath12 .",
    "the main result of @xcite is an orbifold cohomology version of   for abelian symplectic quotients . in other words , they show that the inclusion @xmath17 induces a surjective ring map ( the `` * orbifold kirwan map * '' ) @xmath18 where the domain is a new ring which they define : it is the * inertial cohomology ring * @xmath19 of the @xmath9-space @xmath10 .",
    "( here it is nontrivial that @xmath20 is a ring homomorphism ; the same subtlety also arises in the hyperkhler case . )",
    "moreover , they give an explicit description of the kernel of @xmath20 .",
    "their proof relies on symplectic - geometric properties of the fixed point sets @xmath21 for @xmath22 in abelian hamiltonian spaces , as well as on the original kirwan surjectivity result  .    in this paper",
    "we prove a parallel story in the hypertoric setting .",
    "a direct hyperkhler analogue of   is nontrivial for several reasons , foremost among which is that it is not known whether the hyperkhler analogue of   is , in general , surjective .",
    "however , in the special case where @xmath3 is a smooth or orbifold hypertoric variety @xcite , @xcite , obtained as a hyperkhler quotient of @xmath23 , a hyperkhler analogue of   does hold , allowing us to obtain results in this setting .",
    "the other nontrivial issues are the non - compactness of the hypertoric varieties ( in @xcite , all orbifolds are assumed compact ) and the analysis of the hyperkhler - geometric properties of the fixed point sets @xmath24 for @xmath25 .",
    "we deal with these issues in section  [ sec : surjection ] to obtain the following .",
    "let @xmath26 denote the hyperkhler moment map on @xmath23 , and @xmath0 its hyperkhler quotient at a regular value @xmath27 as described in section  [ sec : background - hypertoric ] .",
    "[ th : surjectiontocrcohomology ] let @xmath3 be an orbifold hypertoric variety @xmath0 .",
    "there is a surjective ring homomorphism @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the subgroup of @xmath9 generated by finite stabilizers , @xmath30 is the @xmath29-subring of the inertial cohomology ring @xmath31 , and @xmath2 is the chen - ruan cohomology of @xmath3 .",
    "the point of theorem  [ th : surjectiontocrcohomology ] is that we can in principle compute the orbifold cohomology of the hypertoric variety @xmath32 as a quotient of @xmath33 by the kernel of  . in the spirit of @xcite , we give an explicit algorithm for computing both the domain @xmath33 and the ideal @xmath34 in terms of the combinatorics of a central rational cooriented weighted hyperplane arrangement @xmath35 along with a choice of simple affinization @xmath36 .",
    "this combinatorial data is obtained from the data of the @xmath9-action on @xmath23 and an appropriate choice of level set of the hyperkhler moment map ( explained in detail in section  [ sec : background - hypertoric ] ) .",
    "we now give a rough statement of our main theorem , which gives a flavor of the ingredients in the computation ; the precise version is theorem  [ theorem : main - comb ] .    [",
    "theorem : main - intro ] let @xmath32 be an orbifold hypertoric variety .",
    "let @xmath37 be a simple affine rational cooriented hyperplane arrangement with positive normal vectors @xmath38 associated to @xmath3 as described in section  [ sec : background - hypertoric ] .",

    ", this manuscript can be viewed in any of the following ways .",
    "first , it is an example of an explicit computation of the chen - ruan orbifold cohomology of hyperkhler quotients , and a further development , in the hyperkhler setting , of the definition and use of inertial cohomology as introduced in @xcite . in particular",
    ", we note that our methods would also apply to any class of hyperkhler quotients for which there exists an appropriate analogue of the kirwan surjection  .",
    "similarly , although in this manuscript we restrict our attention to @xmath45 coefficients for our cohomology rings , if a @xmath46-coefficient analogue of the kirwan surjection for orbifold hypertoric varieties is proven , then our methods will easily generalize to the setting of @xmath46 coefficients .",
    "second , it is another exploration of the relationship between the geometry of hypertoric varieties and the combinatorics of hyperplane arrangements .",
    "finally , it is the hyperkhler - geometric analogue of the algebraic - geometric description of the chow ring of toric deligne - mumford stacks in @xcite .    in @xcite , jiang and tseng",
    "independently develop techniques for an algebraic - geometric version of these results by defining `` hypertoric dm stacks '' using extended stacky fans , following work of @xcite .",
    "their work applies to the sub - class of hypertoric varieties m obtained by hyperkhler quotients at regular values of the form @xmath47 . in this case",
    ", there is a simple affine hyperplane arrangement @xmath1 in @xmath48 determined by the data of a moment map for a residual torus action on @xmath3 ; the results of @xcite are phrased in terms of this arrangement @xmath1 .",
    "our results , on the other hand , apply to an orbifold hypertoric variety obtained as a quotient at any regular value @xmath49 . this is because we do not keep track of the hyperkhler structure of the quotient ( which does depends on this choice of level set ) ; the chen - ruan orbifold cohomology of the quotient turns out to be _ independent _ of this choice , i.e. is the same for any regular value .",
    "the main difference between the approach taken in this manuscript and @xcite is that jiang and tseng begin with the data of a simple hyperplane arrangement @xmath1 and then directly construct the hypertoric dm stack associated to @xmath1 , which has coarse moduli space the corresponding orbifold hypertoric variety . as a result",
    ", they compute the product in the orbifold chow ring entirely in terms of the quotient hypertoric variety .",
    "in contrast , our method is to work almost entirely `` upstairs '' on @xmath23 with a linear @xmath9-action , before taking a hyperkhler quotient .",
    "this simplifies some computations ( as in @xcite ) by allowing us to work with linear @xmath9-representations , and carries the information of a family of hypertoric varieties at once .",
    "since orbifold chen - ruan cohomology reduces to ordinary cohomology when @xmath3 is smooth , both our work and that of @xcite reduce to the description of @xmath50 given in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) in the case when @xmath3 is a smooth hypertoric variety . as jiang and tseng illustrate @xcite , this can be useful to show that the ordinary cohomology of a smooth hyperkhler crepant resolution of @xmath51 as constructed by kronheimer @xcite is isomorphic to the orbifold cohomology of @xmath51 , which can be computed using @xcite .",
    "we now give a summary of the contents of the paper . in section  [ sec : background - hypertoric ] , we give a brief account of the construction of hypertoric varieties as a hyperkhler quotient , based on the data of a hyperplane arrangement . in section",
    "[ sec : definition ] , we briefly recall the definition of inertial cohomology given in @xcite . then in section  [ sec : surjection ] , we prove that there exists a surjection in inertial cohomology as in  .",
    "we give a combinatorial description of the chen - ruan orbifold cohomology of a hypertoric variety , based on the data of the hyperplane arrangement @xmath1 , in section  [ sec : comb ] . in section  [ sec : example ] , we work out in detail several explicit examples , including some computations of orbifold betti numbers and orbifold euler characteristics .",
    "the appendix ( section  [ sec : definitionchase ] ) contains a detailed discussion of the isomorphism between inertial cohomology of a @xmath9-space @xmath52 and the chen - ruan cohomology of the quotient @xmath53 ( also discussed for the compact case in @xcite ) , as well as a careful proof of the correspondence between chen and ruan s definition of the obstruction bundle with that used in the algebraic geometry literature ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we first briefly describe the construction of hypertoric varieties in order to set the notation and conventions to be used throughout the rest of the paper .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a more leisurely account .",
    "we begin with the hyperkhler space @xmath54 , thought of as a holomorphic cotangent bundle @xmath55 this is a hyperkhler manifold with real symplectic form @xmath56 given by the identification with @xmath57 and @xmath58 the canonical holomorphic symplectic form on a cotangent bundle .",
    "the standard linear diagonal action of the compact torus @xmath59 on @xmath60 induces an action on the holomorphic cotangent bundle @xmath23 which is hyperhamiltonian @xcite .",
    "we will refer to this action as the * standard hyperhamiltonian action of @xmath59 on @xmath23 .",
    "* the hyperkhler @xmath59-moment map @xmath61 on @xmath23 is given as follows .",
    "let @xmath62 be a dual basis to @xmath63 in @xmath64 , and let @xmath65 where the @xmath66 are the base variables and the @xmath67 are the fiber variables .",
    "we have @xmath68    let @xmath69 be a central rational cooriented weighted hyperplane arrangement in @xmath70 with positive normal vectors @xmath38 in @xmath71 . here , `` weighted '' means that we do not require the @xmath72 to be primitive vectors .",
    "we now use this data to restrict the @xmath59 action to that of a subtorus .",
    "let @xmath63 be a basis of @xmath73 .",
    "define a linear map @xmath74 by @xmath75 let @xmath76 where @xmath77 with inclusion @xmath78 this yields an exact sequence @xmath79 & { \\mathfrak{t}}= { \\mathfrak{t}}^k \\ar[r]^{\\iota } & { \\mathfrak{t}}^n \\ar[r]^{\\beta } & { \\mathfrak{t}}^d \\ar[r ] & 0 , \\\\           &                                 & \\varepsilon_i \\ar@{|->}[r ] & a_i & \\\\ } \\ ] ] which on the one hand exponentiates to an exact sequence @xmath80 & t = t^k \\ar[r]^{\\exp\\iota } &",

    "now we restrict the @xmath59-action on @xmath23 to the subtorus @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath84 as in",
    ". then @xmath85 is the @xmath9-weight defining the action of the subtorus @xmath9 on the @xmath86-th coordinate of @xmath60 .",
    "let @xmath87 denote the corresponding element in @xmath88 since the action of @xmath9 on @xmath23 is given by the natural lift of that on @xmath60 , we have that for @xmath89 @xmath90 the moment maps for the hyperhamiltonian @xmath9-action on @xmath23 are given by composing @xmath91 with the linear projection @xmath92 thus we obtain the formulas @xmath93 we will assume throughout that @xmath94    in order to specify the hyperkhler quotient , we now pick a regular value @xmath95 at which to reduce .",
    "any element @xmath96 specifies an affinization @xmath37 of @xmath97 via the equations @xmath98 where @xmath99 denotes the natural pairing of a vector space and its dual , and @xmath100 is a lift of @xmath12 , i.e. @xmath101 ( a different choice of lift just translates the whole hyperplane arrangement by a constant . )    in particular , the choice of parameter @xmath102 corresponds to _ three _ separate choices of affinization of the central arrangement @xmath97 .",
    "hence a hypertoric variety is determined by the combinatorial data of a central weighted arrangement @xmath97 and , additionally , @xmath103 choices of affinization of @xmath97 . however , in the case of our computation , this data can be simplified considerably .",
    "this is because a preimage @xmath104 of a regular value of @xmath105 is @xmath59-equivariantly diffeomorphic to the preimage @xmath106 of any other regular value ; this can be seen by an argument essentially equivalent to the proof of @xcite[lemma 2.1 ] .",
    "hence the chen - ruan cohomology of @xmath107 can be seen to be isomorphic to that of @xmath108 as will be discussed further in remark  [ remark : cr - indep - of - alphac ] . in other words ,",
    "the chen - ruan cohomology of an orbifold hypertoric variety is determined by the original central arrangement @xmath97 , and is independent of these choices of affine structures given by regular values . in practice , however , it is useful to pick a convenient affinization with which to work .",
    "namely , if @xmath109 is chosen such that the corresponding affinization of @xmath97 is * simple * hyperplanes intersect in codimension @xmath110 . ]",
    ", then @xmath111 is a regular value @xcite[theorem 3.3 ] . here , since the last two parameters are both @xmath7 , only the first factor gives rise to a nontrivial affinization of @xmath97 .",
    "we will denote by @xmath112 this _ simple _ affine rational cooriented weighted hyperplane arrangement obtained from the data of @xmath35 and an appropriate @xmath113",
    "we begin with a brief account of inertial cohomology as developed in @xcite , which gives us a model for computing the orbifold cohomology of the hyperkhler quotients constructed in section  [ sec : background - hypertoric ] .",
    "readers already familiar with the definition of orbifold cohomology in the sense of chen and ruan will find section  [ subsec : inertial - def - smile ] straightforward , since the product on the inertial cohomology of a @xmath9-space @xmath52 is defined precisely to mimic the chen - ruan product in the case that the quotient @xmath53 is an orbifold , where @xmath9 acts with finite stabilizers on @xmath52 .",
    "the contribution of @xcite is to notice that in other cases of @xmath9-spaces ( such as hamiltonian @xmath9-spaces ) , the product on inertial cohomology can be described in terms of a ( different ) product defined in terms of fixed point data .",
    "this ( different ) product , which is easier to compute , is briefly recalled in section  [ subsec : robust ] ; it will play a key role in our computation of the chen - ruan orbifold cohomology of hypertoric varieties .",
    "let @xmath10 be a stably complex @xmath9-space .",
    "for any @xmath115 let @xmath21 denote the @xmath116-fixed points .",
