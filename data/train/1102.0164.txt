    "one of the most exciting recent applications of quantum information theory has been to the field of metrology . a number of theoretical proposals @xcite have demonstrated that it is possible to use entanglement to surpass the so - called shot - noise limit .",
    "this limit is due to unavoidable statistical fluctuations that arise when discrete independent events are used to make a measurement .",
    "it is characterized by a precision that scales as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the number of discrete events recorded , such as tosses of a coin or particles detected .    if , instead , we remove the constraint that the subsystems are independent of one another and allow them to be entangled , then it is possible to reach the heisenberg limit whereby the measurement precision scales as @xmath2 .",
    "there have even been some proposals for schemes that exploit nonlinearities to go beyond the heisenberg limit @xcite .",
    "however , it is now thought that these schemes misinterpret the resources required and so the heisenberg limit is indeed fundamental @xcite .",
    "metrology schemes are often based on interferometers because they offer unrivalled precision in the measurement of phase shifts or path length differences . as well as their familiar linear forms",
    ", interferometers can also be successfully implemented in ring geometries to make accurate measurements of angular momentum .",
    "these interferometric gyroscopes form a key component of many modern navigation and stabilisation systems .",
    "they work by exploiting the different path lengths experienced by light as it propagates in opposite directions around a rotating ring .",
    "for instance , in the sagnac geometry @xcite photons are put into a superposition of travelling in opposite directions around a ring and , when rotated , the two directions acquire different phases due to their different path lengths .",
    "this phase difference is directly related to the rate of rotation and can be measured by recombining the two components at a beam splitter .",
    "the precision of gyroscopic devices can be improved further still with the use of entangled atoms rather than photons .",
    "the precision with which a sagnac interferometer can measure a phase difference is @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the particle wavelength , @xmath5 is the particle speed , @xmath6 is the angular velocity of the ring , and @xmath7 is the enclosed area . for equal values of @xmath6 and @xmath7 ,",
    "the ratio of the precision for atoms with mass @xmath8 to photons with frequency @xmath9 is @xmath10 , which for reasonable parameters is about @xmath11 .",
    "so , even though the particle fluxes are likely to be much lower for atoms and the enclosed areas smaller , the very large enhancement factor for atoms means that they are likely to offer considerable advantages over photons .",
    "the use of entangled atomic states to make precision measurements of rotations has received a lot of recent attention .",
    "it is possible to achieve sub - shot - noise measurements by using number - squeezed atomic states as the input to an interferometer and so there has been a lot of research into the generation and uses of these states @xcite .",
    "several proposals have already been made to use different non - classical atomic states to make general phase measurements with sub - shot noise sensitivities @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that uncorrelated atoms can also achieve sub shot - noise sensitivities of rotational phase shifts @xcite by using a chain of matter wave interferometers , or a chain of gyroscopes .",
    "it is clear that there is a link between entanglement or squeezing and the measurement precision that can be achieved , however the precise relationship is not obvious .",
    "while it can be shown that a noon state of the form , @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively , gives the best possible precision ( i.e. it saturates the heisenberg limit ) in the lossless case , the same is not true when we account for the loss that will inevitably be present in any realistic system .",
    "the problem is that noon states are known to be extremely fragile .",
    "the loss of a single particle destroys the superposition .",
    "so while , they have excellent short - term sensitivity , their long - term stability is very poor .",
    "this means that they can only be used to make very short timescale comparisons , which degrades their overall precision .",
    "think of frequency standards : the longer we can compare our system with the standard , the more accurately we can detect any difference in their frequencies .",
    "so there is an important trade - off between the entanglement in a system and the robustness of the state to decoherence .",
    "we can quantify how accurately a state can measure an unknown parameter with the quantum fisher information and its associated cramr - rao bound .",
    "quantum fisher information is defined as , @xmath14,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the density matrix of the system , @xmath16 is the parameter to be measured , and @xmath7 is the symmetric logarithmic derivative defined by , @xmath17.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the eigenbasis of @xmath15 this is , @xmath18_{ij},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 are the eigenvalues of @xmath15 and @xmath20 . if @xmath21 then @xmath22 . the fisher information is related to the uncertainty of the measurement via the cramr - rao bound , @xmath23 . for a pure state ,",
    ", we have , @xmath25 , \\label{fisherpure}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 . fisher information will serve as our yardstick for comparing the performances of different entangled states in metrology .",
    "in this paper we will discuss how a variety of entangled states that are useful for metrology can be created simply by stirring bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) trapped in potentials with different geometries .",
    "we start with the case of noon states and then show how , by modifying the potential and dimensionality of the system , it is possible to create different entangled states that perform better in the presence of decoherence . the general study of the relationship between entanglement , phase transitions , and the geometry of the trapping potential is an exciting new area of research that is just starting to open up .",
    "this development has been motivated , in part , by recent outstanding experimental advances in the ability to trap atoms in a wide variety of time - varying potentials .",
    "the first trapping geometry that we will consider is a lattice of potential nodes in a ring configuration . for simplicity , we will consider a lattice consisting of just three sites as shown in figure  [ fig:3site](a ) since this is the minimum number required for a ring .",
    "the different sites are coupled to one another via quantum mechanical tunnelling through the barriers separating them .",
    "the atoms on any given site also experience a nonlinearity due to collisions with other atoms on that site .",
    "this trap geometry has already been experimentally demonstrated @xcite .",
    "assuming that the system is sufficiently cold that we can consider only one trap level at each site , the system can be described by the bose - hubbard hamiltonian .",
    "the rotation of the sites can be incorporated into the bose - hubbard hamiltonian @xcite simply by including appropriate phase factors in the coupling terms .",
    "this gives the ` twisted ' hamiltonian , @xmath27   + u \\left ( { a^\\dagger}^2 a^2 + { b^\\dagger}^2 b^2 + { c^\\dagger}^2 c^2\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 , @xmath13 and @xmath29 are the annihilation operators of atoms in the three sites , @xmath30 is the on - site interatomic interaction strength and @xmath31 is the coupling between adjacent lattice sites due to tunnelling through the barrier .",
    "the phase factors in the coupling terms are known as peierls phase factors .    ,",
    "@xmath13 , and @xmath29 and can tunnel between adjoining sites .",
    "( b ) energy levels ( in units of j ) plotted as a function of the rotation , @xmath16 , for @xmath32 and @xmath33 . a clear anti - crossing between the two lowest energy levels is seen for @xmath34 . ]",
    "it is convenient to rewrite the hamiltonian in the quasi - momentum basis @xmath35 @xmath36 these new basis states respectively correspond to zero flow , one quantum of clockwise flow , and one quantum of anticlockwise flow , where throughout this paper we will use the convention that a positive phase variation corresponds to clockwise flow .    in this basis ,",
    "the twisted hamiltonian has the form @xmath37 the full energy spectrum of the system can be found by diagonalising this hamiltonian .",
    "however , we can gain a lot of insight about the behaviour of the system simply from inspection . when there are no interactions ( @xmath38 ) the second and third line of the hamiltonian vanish and when there is no rotation ( @xmath39 ) we see that the ground state is the non - rotating state , @xmath40 , and the other two states are degenerate , as we would expect .",
    "if we were to increase the rotation rate to @xmath41 , the ground state would be all the atoms in @xmath42 , i.e. all rotating with one quantum of angular momentum . in between these values ,",
    "i.e. when @xmath34 , @xmath40 and @xmath42 become degenerate ground states . however , if we include interactions , we see from ( [ flowham ] ) that the different modes are now coupled .",
    "this serves to lift the degeneracy and causes an anticrossing at @xmath34 .",
    "this can be seen in figure  [ fig:3site](b ) , where the energy levels are plotted as a function of @xmath16 for @xmath32 and three atoms .",
    "to a very good approximation , the ground state at the critical rotation rate ( @xmath34 ) is a symmetric superposition of all the atoms in @xmath40 and all in @xmath42 , i.e. a macroscopic superposition or noon state , latexmath:[\\ ] ] where the sum is over all @xmath1 atoms of mass @xmath8 .",
    "the circumference of the ring is @xmath83 , which gives @xmath84 as the atom s position on the circumference of the loop and @xmath85 is the effective one - dimensional interaction strength between the atoms .",
    "the smallest nonzero kinetic energy of a single particle @xmath86 provides a natural unit of energy for this system .",
    "the barrier is assumed to be narrow , so it can be described by a @xmath87-function and has strength @xmath13 .",
    "the barrier stirs the atoms in the ring with tangential velocity @xmath88 along the circumference of the ring and the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : ham1 ] ) is formulated in the co - rotating frame of reference .",
    "it is convenient to write the hamiltonian in the second quantized form using angular momentum operators , @xmath89 where @xmath90 and @xmath91 create and destroy an atom with angular momentum @xmath92 , respectively . in this representation , the hamiltonian is , @xmath93 where the sums are over all quantized angular momentum modes , @xmath92 .",
    "again the ground state and energy spectrum can be found by diagonalising this hamiltonian , however , the hilbert space is infinite so a truncated momentum basis has to be used .",
    "this means that the interaction strength needs to be rescaled as discussed in @xcite .",
    "much can be understood about the system by considering the terms in the hamiltonian .",
    "the kinetic energy term and the interaction term both conserve the total angular momentum and it is only the barrier term that couples states of different total angular momentum . when the barrier is rotated at a rate @xmath94 , the energy of the 0 and @xmath95 angular momentum modes become degenerate , as described in section  [ sec : lattice_ring ] . in the non - interacting case",
    "this means states with 0 to @xmath96 total angular momentum become degenerate .",
    "when interactions are introduced the degeneracy is lifted except the 0 and @xmath96 states and at a certain interaction strength , and with a finite barrier height , the ground state becomes similar to a noon state .",
    "increase the interactions further and the noon state is lost , however the ground state is still a superposition of 0 to @xmath96 total angular momentum , because the interaction does not couple states of different total angular momentum .",
    "what we find is the states above this certain interaction still produce measurements with the same precision as the noon state , however , their robustness is far better .    in the strongly interacting tg regime",
    "the state of the system looks very different from a noon state .",
    "the single particle momentum distribution for the 0 and @xmath96 total angular momentum states are spread out and overlap each other .",
    "this means that if an atom is detected it can not be discerned which of the total angular momentum states it came from and so it does not destroy the superposition .",
    "the performance of the tg superposition in the presence of loss is compared with the noon and unentangled states in figure  [ fig : tg ] for @xmath97 .",
    "the tg plot is for @xmath98 ( i.e. a small barrier ) and strong interactions , @xmath99 , i.e. deep in the tg regime .",
    "the calculation was performed on a truncated basis with 18 angular momentum modes and the results do not change noticeably as the basis is increased .",
    "we see that the initial fisher information is equal to that of the noon state in the case without loss .",
    "when loss is considered , the reduction of the fisher information is far slower and is always better than unentangled atoms .",
    "another advantage of the system is the practical creation of the superposition . for the noon state",
    "it was shown that even for the case of no decoherence it would be experimentally difficult to create for more than a few atoms due to the extreme precision required in the rotation rate  @xcite .",
    "the tg superposition is far more stable to experimental imperfections and energy level spacings between the ground and excited states are far larger allowing more rapid creation of the superposition .",
    "the idea of creating different entangled states by rotating matter waves in trapping potentials with different geometries is an exciting new area of research .",
    "there are already some interesting results for how entangled states that are suited to quantum metrology schemes could be generated relatively easily .",
    "there is still a lot to be done",
    ". it will be particularly interesting to see how different symmetry properties in the potential manifest themselves in different features of the entangled states .",
    "this may lead to quite general quantum state engineering proposals for rotating matter waves .",
    "the models proposed here and their extensions may also prove to be valuable models for exploring the deeper connections between phase transitions , entanglement , and metrology .",
