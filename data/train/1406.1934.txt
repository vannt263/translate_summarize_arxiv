    "( 2013c ) , the correlation between the jet power and the prompt gamma - ray luminosity of gamma - ray bursts is consistent with the correlation between the jet power and the synchrotron radiation peak luminosity of fsrqs , and the gev nls1 galaxies extend this correlation to the low jet power end ( see figure 2 in zhang et al .",
    "the results in this paper further confirm that the radiation physics in these relativistic jets are analogous .",

    "the gev nls1 galaxies would be the best candidates to study this issue since the radiations from the jet , the accretion disk , and the corona may all be detected for these sources . with a very small sample in this analysis , we find that the accretion disk luminosity and the jet power of gev nls1 galaxies distribute in broad ranges , which may cover the ranges of both fsrqs and bl lacs .",

    "although the @xmath3 ratio of 1h 0323 + 342 distributes at the high end of the distribution of this ratio for a rq seyfert galaxy sample , it is still unclear whether a system with a high @xmath3 ratio prefers to power a jet .    as an intermediate group between bl lacs and fsrqs",

    "their accretion disks may be truncated by the evaporation and are dominated by an clumpy advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ; e.g. , yuan & narayan 2014 ) , and a small inner accretion disk that is fed by the condensation of corona gas may be presented ( liu et al .",
    "2007 ; liu 2013 ; qiao & liu 2013 ; qiao et al .",

    "the accretion - outflow structure may transfer to that in gev nls1 galaxies .",
    "the inner thin disks for both of bl lacs and gev nls1 galaxies may extend to around the inner - most stable circular orbit ( isco ) , and thus their jets may be produced via the blandford - payne ( bp , blandford & payne 1982 ) and/or blandford - znajek ( bz , blandford & znajek 1977 ) mechanisms ( e.g. , zhang 2013 ; zhang et al .",
    "the increase of the accretion rate may also lead to that the evaporation is not strong enough to completely remove the disk , then the corona is condensed by the inverse compton scattering of the soft photons from the disk ( liu et al .",
    "2007 ; liu 2013 ) . in this case , a complete thin disk with a weak corona would exist .",
    "the thin disk also extends to around isco and a jet may be launched mostly via the bz mechanism .",
