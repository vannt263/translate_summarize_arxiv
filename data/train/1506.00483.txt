    "a neutron star has a very dense core , consisting probably of homogeneous and very neutron - rich matter ( other constituents are protons , electrons , and perhaps hyperons ; the extremely dense center of the core might even contain deconfined quark matter ) , which is surrounded by the inner and the outer crust.@xcite in the crust , the baryon density @xmath0 is below @xmath1  @xmath2 ( i.e. , mass density @xmath3  g@xmath4@xmath5 ) and the matter is inhomogeneous , containing dense positively charged `` clusters '' and a highly degenerate electron gas .",
    "the difference between the inner and the outer crust is that in the outer crust , the clusters are simply neutron - rich nuclei , while in the inner crust ( at mass density @xmath6  g@xmath4@xmath5,@xcite i.e. , baryon density @xmath7  @xmath2 ) , the neutron excess becomes so strong that some neutrons are not bound any more in the clusters and form a dilute neutron gas between the clusters.@xcite to minimize coulomb energy , the clusters are believed to arrange in a periodic lattice . with increasing density of the neutron gas near the core , the crystalline lattice might transform into the so - called `` pasta '' phases , i.e. , clusters merge first into rods ( `` spaghetti '' ) , then into plates ( `` lasagne '' ) , and then some theories predict also `` inverted '' geometries where the more dilute neutron gas is concentrated in tubes or holes ( `` swiss cheese '' ) before the homogeneous core is reached.@xcite    in the first 50100 years after the creation of the neutron star in a supernova explosion , its core cools down very efficiently by neutrino emission . during this so - called crust - thermalization epoch , the crust stays hotter than the core .",
    "since the observed temperature is that at the surface , the thermal properties of the crust influence the observed cooling curve.@xcite in accreting neutron stars , the matter falling on the star results from time to time in nuclear reactions in the crust , leading to a strong heating ( released as x - ray burst ) .",
    "the subsequent cooling of these x - ray transients offers another possibility to get information on the thermodynamic properties of the crust.@xcite    the main ingredients to describe heat transport in the crust are the specific heat and the heat conductivity .",
    "they depend mainly on excitations whose energy is of the same order of magnitude as the temperature @xmath8 . since on a nuclear energy scale , the temperatures of interest ( @xmath9 kev , corresponding to @xmath10 k ) are very low , the most relevant excitations in the outer crust are the electrons ( specific heat @xmath11 ) and the phonons of the crystal lattice ( @xmath12 ) . in the inner crust ,",
    "the situation is more complicated , since there are in addition the unbound neutrons of the gas between the clusters .",
    "if these neutrons were a normal fermi gas , their contribution to @xmath13 at low @xmath8 would be linear in @xmath8 , like that of the electrons but much larger due to the higher density of states .",
    "however , for most of the relevant densities and temperatures one can assume that the neutrons are superfluid ( although the density dependence of the critical temperature @xmath14 of neutron matter is not precisely known ) . in this case , the energy for the creation of a neutron quasiparticle is of the order of the pairing gap @xmath15  mev , and analogously to the specific heat of a superconductor,@xcite the contribution of neutron quasiparticles to the specific heat is exponentially suppressed ( @xmath16 ) at low @xmath8 .",
    "it was therefore argued that whether neutron pairing is stronger or weaker can have an observable effect on the cooling curve.@xcite vice versa , observation of neutron - star cooling might help to constrain the superfluid critical temperature in neutron star matter.@xcite    in contrast to the gapped neutron quasiparticles , long - wavelength collective modes of the neutron gas can be thermally excited at low temperature and contribute to the specific heat and the heat conductivity ( although the electron and lattice - phonon contributions are usually dominant@xcite ) .",
    "this article is divided into two parts . in sec .",
    "[ sec : goldstone ] , we start by discussing collective modes in homogeneous low - density neutron matter and in particular the appearance of the goldstone mode as a phase oscillation of the superfluid order parameter ( gap ) and its connection with superfluid hydrodynamics . for inhomogeneous crust matter , we then summarize results of completely microscopic calculations , which are however limited to wavelengths smaller than the distance between neighboring clusters , as well as results in the long - wavelength limit . in sec .",
    "[ sec : hydropasta ] , we discuss in detail a model for collective modes in the pasta phases , in particular in the lasagne phase , based on superfluid hydrodynamics .    throughout the article , we use natural units with @xmath17 ( @xmath18 reduced planck constant , @xmath19 speed of light , @xmath20 boltzmann constant ) .",
    "for simplicity , let us start our discussion with a uniform neutron gas , although this is of course a very incomplete model of the inner crust since it neglects the presence of dense clusters .",
    "collective modes are conveniently described in the framework of the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) for the response of uniform matter.@xcite it has already been used in astrophysical contexts , e.g. , to calculate the neutrino mean - free path.@xcite however , the rpa does not include pairing and superfluidity .",
    "the extension of the rpa to systems with pairing is called quasiparticle rpa ( qrpa).@xcite qrpa calculations in uniform neutron and neutron - star matter , using the so - called landau approximation for the particle - hole ( ph ) interaction , were done in refs .  .",
    "here we will discuss results for neutron matter obtained in ref .   with the full skyrme interaction in the ph channel .",
    "also in other fields of physics , the rpa was generalized to systems with pairing .",
    "let us mention the seminal work by anderson@xcite and bogoliubov@xcite for the case of superconductors , or some more recent work on collective modes in ultracold fermi gases in the unitary limit.@xcite    the qrpa describes small oscillations around the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) ground state and can be derived by linearizing the time - dependent hfb equations.@xcite in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : neutrongas ] ,    we show the qrpa density response function @xmath21 of neutron matter , as a function of the excitation energy @xmath22 for different values of the momentum @xmath23 . at first glance",
    ", the response resembles the broad ph continuum of the usual rpa response .",
    "since the landau parameter @xmath24 relevant for the density channel is negative , there is no zero - sound _ above _",
    "the continuum.@xcite however , at low energies , one sees that , because of pairing , the ph continuum starting at @xmath25 is transformed into a two - quasiparticle ( 2qp ) continuum starting at a threshold given by approximately @xmath26.quantitatively , the bcs result for @xmath27 used in ref .",
    "is too high since it does not account for screening of the pairing interaction.@xcite ] this gives rise to the appearance of an undamped collective mode _ below _ the threshold , indicated by the arrows .",
    "the nature of this collective mode is a phase oscillation of the gap @xmath28 . in the ground state ,",
    "the phase @xmath29 is arbitrary but constant ( spontaneous @xmath30 symmetry breaking ) .",
    "usually it is assumed without loss of generality that @xmath27 is real , i.e. , @xmath31 , but a global change of the phase does not cost any energy .",
    "however , if the phase varies spatially as @xmath32 , the excitation energy @xmath22 is proportional to @xmath23 .",
    "such a mode related to a spontaneously broken symmetry is called a goldstone mode,@xcite in the case of a superfluid it is also known as bogoliubov - anderson ( ba ) sound . note that this ba sound@xcite exists only in superfluids but not in superconductors : in the case of charged particles , the broken symmetry is a local one ( the electromagnetic gauge symmetry ) and in this case there is no goldstone mode.@xcite    if the phase @xmath33 is not constant , the cooper pairs ( of mass @xmath34 , where @xmath35 denotes the neutron mass ) move with a collective velocity@xcite @xmath36 hence , the goldstone mode corresponds to a longitudinal density wave .",
    "in contrast to zero sound , the goldstone mode does not deform the fermi sphere during the oscillation . therefore its speed of sound @xmath37 is given by the hydrodynamic formula @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the neutron chemical potential and density , respectively .    in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : neutrongas ] , we show the dispersion relation @xmath41 ( solid line ) of the collective mode obtained in qrpa . as anticipated , it agrees perfectly with the hydrodynamic one @xmath42 for small @xmath23 ( dash - dot line ) .",
    "however , when @xmath22 approaches the 2qp theshold ( dotted line ) , it deviates from the linear dispersion law . at high values of @xmath23 ,",
    "the collective mode enters the 2qp continuum and gets damped ( dashed line ) .    at low temperatures @xmath43",
    ", one may neglect the temperature dependence of the dispersion relation and the damping of the goldstone mode . since mainly modes with @xmath44 are excited , the deviations from the linear dispersion law @xmath45 are negligible , too .",
    "therefore , the neutron - gas contribution to the specific heat at low temperature can be written analytically as @xmath46 analogous to the specific heat of phonons in a crystal.@xcite on the one hand , this is of course much larger than the contribution of neutron quasiparticles , which is suppressed by an exponential factor @xmath47 . on the other hand , it is still much smaller than the specific heat of normal - fluid ( i.e. , unpaired ) neutrons , which would be linear in @xmath8 .",
    "so far , we have discussed only a homogeneous neutron gas . in order to describe clusters in the gas , often the wigner - seitz ( ws )",
    "approximation is employed .",
    "this approximation consists in replacing the elementary cell of the crystal lattice by a sphere of radius @xmath48 , having the same volume as the elementary cell , with the cluster in its center .",
    "the advantage is that then all quantities , i.e. , the densities , the mean - field , the coulomb potential , etc .",
    ", depend only on the distance @xmath49 from the center of the cell .",
    "this spherical symmetry makes it possible to carry out hf@xcite or hfb@xcite calculations with the large numbers of particles contained in a ws cell . as an example , we display in the left panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : ws ]    the hfb density profile in a ws cell containing 1750 neutrons and 50 protons ( @xmath50sn ) calculated by khan et al.@xcite the nuclear cluster surrounded by the gas is clearly visible , the gas density being practically constant for @xmath51  fm ( except for a small bump near @xmath48 which is an artefact due to the boundary conditions@xcite ) .",
    "based on the hfb ground state , khan et al.@xcite calculated the collective modes within qrpa , too .",
    "as an example , the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : ws ] shows the quadrupole strength ( imaginary part of the quadrupole response function ) within the ws cell as a function of the excitation energy @xmath22 . a strongly collective mode , called `` super - giant resonance '' in ref .  , appears well below the unperturbed 2qp quadrupole excitations ( dotted line ) .",
    "this super - giant resonance is mainly an excitation of the neutron gas .",
    "its energy of @xmath52  mev as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : ws ] can be roughly understood by considering it as the lowest eigenmode of the hydrodynamic ( ba ) sound in the spherical cell . in ref .",
    ", this energy was estimated as @xmath53 ( @xmath54 being the fermi velocity ) with @xmath23 determined from @xmath55 ( @xmath56 being a spherical bessel function ; in the case of the quadrupole mode : @xmath57 ) .",
    "note , however , that @xmath58 is the speed of sound of an ideal fermi gas , which is about 50% higher than the speed of sound @xmath37 one gets from eq .",
    "( [ eq : speedofsound ] ) .",
    "the argument for the ( approximate ) validity of hydrodynamics is that the ws cell is much larger than the coherence length @xmath59 in the neutron gas.@xcite actually , up to some factors of order unity , the condition @xmath60 or @xmath61 is equivalent to @xmath62 .",
    "obviously these conditions are not very well satisfied , so that one expects to find at a quantitative level some deviations from hydrodynamics , similar to the deviation of the qrpa dispersion relation @xmath41 in uniform matter from the linear one , @xmath42 ( cf .",
    "[ fig : neutrongas ] ) .",
    "let us mention that the correspondence between qrpa and superfluid hydrodynamics in non - uniform systems in the case of strong enough pairing was demonstrated in ref .   in the context of trapped ultracold fermi gases , too .",
    "however , because of the typically very large numbers of atoms and strong pairing in these systems , the situation is usually much more favorable than it is in the neutron star crust , and superfluid hydrodynamics can give precise predictions for the frequencies of collective modes.@xcite      while the ws approximation is well suited for the description of static properties , it is obviously not capable of describing collective modes whose wavelengths exceed the size of the ws cell .",
    "in reality , however , the most relevant modes at low temperature are acoustic modes , i.e. , modes whose energy @xmath22 is proportional to @xmath23 for @xmath63 .    as mentioned in sec .  [",
    "sec : uniform ] , the goldstone mode in the uniform neutron gas is a consequence of the broken global @xmath30 symmetry and corresponds to an oscillation of the phase @xmath29 of the neutron gap .",
    "this argument remains valid in the presence of clusters .",
    "this lead cirigilano et al.@xcite to develop an effective theory for the combined system of the superfluid neutron gas and the crystal lattice of clusters .",
    "the degrees of freedom , i.e. , the fields appearing in the effective lagrangian , are the phase @xmath64 of the neutron gap and the displacement @xmath65 of the clusters .",
    "similar low - energy theories were subsequently used in refs .  .",
    "since @xmath29 and @xmath66 are coarse - grained over regions larger than the periodicity @xmath67 of the crystal lattice , these low - energy theories are only valid for @xmath68 .",
    "of course , clusters and neutron superfluid do not move independently of each other .",
    "this is called the entrainment effect.@xcite it should be noted that in contrast to an ordinary dragging of the gas by the clusters ( and vice versa ) , the entrainment is a non - dissipative force .",
    "it modifies the velocities @xmath69 and @xmath70 of the longitudinal and transverse lattice phonons , respectively , as well as the velocity @xmath71 of the goldstone mode ( also called superfluid phonon).@xcite furthermore , the longitudinal lattice phonons and the goldstone mode get mixed@xcite and one finds two new eigenmodes with two new velocities @xmath72 .",
    "the framework of low - energy effective theory was not only used to describe the long - wavelength phonons , but also phonon - phonon and phonon - electron interactions .",
    "these are particularly relevant for the calculation of the phonon ( lattice and superfluid ) contribution to transport properties such as the heat conductivity.@xcite    the coefficients of the effective theory , in particular the entrainment and mixing coefficients , were calculated by chamel@xcite using a band - structure calculation for the neutrons in the periodic mean field of the clusters@xcite analogous to those used in solid - state physics for the electrons in the periodic coulomb field of the ions in a metal . as an example , we display in fig .",
    "[ fig : phononmix ]    the results of ref .   for the density dependence of the different velocities without ( dotted lines ) and with ( dashed lines ) entrainment and with both entrainment and mixing ( solid lines ) .",
    "one observes that the coupling between the lattice and the superfluid neutron gas has a drastic effect on the lattice phonons .",
    "the entrainment results in a reduction of the phonon velocities , since some neutrons of the gas move together with the clusters , _ increasing _ the cluster effective mass ( in the language of refs .",
    ", the density of `` conduction neutrons '' moving independently of the clusters is smaller than the density of `` unbound '' neutrons ) .",
    "however , as pointed out by kobyakov and pethick,@xcite zero - point oscillations of the clusters may reduce the band structure effects .",
    "furthermore , we note that , using a completely different approach ( similar to the one we will use in the next section ) , magierski and bulgac@xcite arrived at the opposite result , namely that the effective mass of the clusters is _ reduced _ when they are immersed in the neutron gas . we conclude that the microscopic modeling of the coefficients of the effective theory , in particular those depending on the entrainment , is not yet completely settled .",
    "after this survey of works pointing out the connection between the goldstone mode of the superfluid neutrons and superfluid hydrodynamics , let us now describe in some detail our hydroynamic model for the collective modes , extending our preceding work.@xcite in particular , we include the coulomb interaction , neglected in ref .",
    ", in order to describe simultaneously superfluid modes and lattice phonons .",
    "our aim is to cover also wavelengths that are large compared to the coherence length ( cf .",
    "discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec : ws ] ) but not necessarily large compared to the periodicity @xmath67 of the crystal lattice . in this sense the approach bridges between the two extreme cases discussed above . in principle",
    "the formalism can be applied to all phases of the inner crust , but in the practical calculations we restrict ourselves to the simplest case , which is the phase of plates ( `` lasagne '' ) , see sec .",
    "[ sec : modesinlasagne ] .      for the ground - state configuration , we use a very simple model .",
    "we describe matter in the inner crust as a mixed phase consisting of a neutron gas ( phase 1 ) and a neutron - proton liquid ( phase 2 ) .",
    "we assume that in equilibrium the densities in each phase are constant and the two phases are separated by a sharp interface .",
    "we neglect the smooth variation of the density , found in microscopic calculations ( cf .",
    "left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : ws ] ) , at the transition from one phase to the other .",
    "since the phases coexist , the pressure and the chemical potentials must be equal in both phases .",
    "in addition , an electron gas globally compensates the charge of the protons .",
    "we approximate it by an ideal gas of massless fermions with uniform density . since neutrons , protons and electrons are in @xmath73-equilibrium , their chemical potentials satisfy @xmath74 .",
    "obviously the model as stated above is very crude . in order to account at least in some approximate way for the realistic ( smooth ) interface , we assume that its effect can be subsumed in a single parameter , the surface tension @xmath75 ( energy per interface area ) .    ,",
    "width=151 ]      since neutrons and protons are paired , we assume that their motion can be described by superfluid hydrodynamic equations , except at the interface between the two phases , where appropriate boundary conditions are needed .",
    "this is similar to the approach used in refs .   to calculate the flow of the neutron gas around and through a moving cluster and the corresponding effective mass of the cluster .    in superfluid hydrodynamics ,",
    "the momentum per particle of each fluid , @xmath76 ( @xmath77 indicating neutrons or protons ) , is related to the phase @xmath78 of the corresponding superfluid order parameter by @xmath79    in the neutron gas , the momentum @xmath80 is proportional to the velocity @xmath81 and we may write @xmath82 in the non - relativistic limit , i.e. , if the total energy density is dominated by the mass density , the proportionality constant @xmath83 is of course given by the neutron mass @xmath35 , and one recovers the well - known expression ( [ eq : v_coll ] ) for the superfluid velocity .",
    "relativistically , however , one finds@xcite that @xmath83 is equal to the enthalpy per particle , which , at zero temperature , equals @xmath39 .    in the liquid phase containing neutrons and protons , the situation is more complicated .",
    "if both fluids have different velocities @xmath84 , the interaction between neutrons and protons can give rise to entrainment , i.e. , to a misalignment between momenta and velocities,@xcite even in a uniform system and already at a microscopic level ( i.e. , independently of the macroscopic entrainment effect mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : eft ] , which is a consequence of the crystalline structure ) .",
    "this microscopic entrainment effect can easily be understood in the framework of landau fermi - liquid theory.@xcite the relationship between velocities and momenta can then be written as @xmath85 where the matrix @xmath86 is related to the so - called andreev - bashkin entrainment matrix , @xmath87 in the notation of ref .  , via @xmath88 . in the non - relativistic case ,",

    "after these preliminary remarks , let us turn to the hydrodynamic description of small oscillations .",
    "the first hydrodynamic equation is the continuity equation , describing the conservation of particle number of each species @xmath92 .",
    "since we are only interested in small oscillations , we consider the fluid velocities @xmath93 as small . in addition , we decompose the density into its constant equilibrium value @xmath94 and a small deviation @xmath95 . keeping only terms linear in the small deviations from equilibrium ,",
    "we can write the continuity equation for species @xmath92 as @xmath96 for the sake of better readability , we will from now on drop the index @xmath97 since it is clear that , after linearization , any quantity that is multiplied by a small quantity ( such as @xmath93 or @xmath98 ) has to be replaced by its equilibrium value .",
    "the second equation is the euler equation , describing the conservation of momentum .",
    "keeping again only terms linear in the deviations from equilibrium , we obtain in the case of the neutron gas @xmath99 where the derivative has to be taken at the equilibrium density @xmath100 . in the liquid phase ,",
    "neutrons and protons are coupled by strong interactions , and in addition the protons feel an acceleration due to the variation of the coulomb potential , @xmath101 .",

    "( [ eq : entrainment_n ] ) and ( [ eq : entrainment_np ] ) , are linearized , too , i.e. , it is sufficient to calculate @xmath86 at the equilibrium densities .",
    "the variation of the coulomb potential depends itself on the variation of the proton and electron densities .",
    "we assume that the electron density follows instantaneously the motion of the protons , leading to a screening of the coulomb interaction .",
    "the corresponding modified poisson equation for the coulomb potential reads @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the debye screening length given by @xmath105    let us now consider harmonic oscillations , i.e. , all deviations from equilibrium ( @xmath78 , @xmath76 , @xmath93 , @xmath98 , @xmath101 ) oscillate like @xmath106 .",
    "therefore we can replace all time derivatives @xmath107 by a factor @xmath108 .",

    "inversely , the value of the surface tension can be estimated from the values of @xmath154 and @xmath165 given by the microscopic calculations,@xcite as @xmath166 in principle the coulomb interaction will result in slightly non - uniform density distributions of the protons inside phase 2 and of the electron gas . however , from the coulomb potential calculated with the uniform density distributions one can estimate that this effect is weak and can be neglected in a first approximation .",
    "the same remarks of caution as in ref .   concerning the dimensions of the structure , the coherence length and the validity of the superfluid hydrodynamics approach ( cf .",
    "discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec : ws ] ) are of course valid here and the interested reader is refered to that paper .",
    "let us now discuss the solutions for the energies @xmath22 and compare the present model with that of ref .  . in fig",

    "the plain red lines correspond to the present model and the dashed blue lines to the model of ref .  , neglecting the coulomb interaction and assuming an impermeable interface between the different phases .",
    "the dotted magenta lines indicate the results of the present model upon neglecting the microscopic entrainment effect and the dash - dotted turquoise line the result neglecting the surface tension .",
    "[ fig : dispersion],width=453 ]    as functions of @xmath23 for three different angles @xmath170 between @xmath153 and the @xmath151 axis ( i.e. , @xmath171 and @xmath172 ) .",
    "the left panel shows the dispersion relation for waves propagating in @xmath151-direction , i.e. perpendicular to the interfaces between the different slabs .",
    "we observe an acoustic branch with an approximately linear dispersion law @xmath173 at low energies , and several optical branches with a finite energy for @xmath174 , analogously to phonon branches in a crystal .",
    "the main differences between the present model ( solid red lines ) and the previous one@xcite ( dashed blue lines ) are as follows :    here we use more realistic boundary conditions corresponding to a permeable interface between the two phases , whereas in ref .",
    "neutrons were not allowed to pass from one phase into the other .",
    "we include the coulomb interaction which was neglected in ref .  .",
    "actually , the change of the boundary conditions has only little influence on the energy spectrum , whereas the coulomb interaction gives rise to an additional mode .",
    "compared with ref .",
    ", we have introduced the surface tension , too .",
    "the effect of the surface tension is obviously vanishing for modes propagating perpendicular to the interface and maximal for modes propagating along the layers . the effect on the excitation energies is small , see the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : dispersion ] , where we display the result for @xmath175 in comparison with the complete calculation . on the other panels",
    "the difference is too small to be seen and therefore not shown .",
    "the effect of microscopic entrainment is weak , too , as can be seen from the left panel .",
    "note that within the wigner - seitz approximation as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : ws ] , we would only obtain a discrete spectrum corresponding to our spectrum in the case @xmath174 .",
    "the reason is that in this approximation the coupling between cells is neglected , and thus each cell has the same excitation spectrum .",
    "the degeneracy of the modes in each cell is lifted by the coupling between cells , which gives rise to a momentum dependent spectrum as obtained in our approach .",
    "let us now look at the cases @xmath176 and @xmath177 shown in the central and right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : dispersion ] . as in ref .",
    ", we find now two acoustic modes .",
    "the energy of the second acoustic mode can be approximately written as @xmath178 which means that this mode propagates in a slab with almost no coupling to neighboring slabs .",
    "the two acoustic modes dominate largely the baryonic contributions to the specific heat and exceed in particular the contributions from superfluid neutron quasiparticles .",
    "the temperature dependence of the specific heat corresponding to the modes shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dispersion ] is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : cv ] .    @xmath2 .",
    "[ fig : cv],width=302 ]    we assume here that the temperature dependence of the mode spectrum can be neglected , which should be true for @xmath179 . the electronic contribution @xmath180 and the contribution from weakly paired neutron quasiparticles@xcite are shown for comparison , too .    at very low temperatures , the specific heat of the collective excitations",
    "is approximately given by@xcite @xmath181 with @xmath182 and @xmath183 .",
    "the @xmath184 term is the usual acoustic phonon , whereas the `` two - dimensional '' mode discussed above gives rise to a contribution increasing as @xmath185.@xcite we note , however , that within our new model the deviations from this approximate formula are stronger than in ref .   for both acoustic modes : the level repulsion due to avoided crossings",
    "let them deviate from the purely linear behavior for much smaller momentum values . as a consequence ,",
    "the approximation ( [ eq : cvapprox ] ) is valid only for much smaller temperatures , where the electronic contribution to the specific heat is the most important one . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : cv ] , the additional mode and the resulting flattening of the acoustic modes increase the contribution to the specific heat .",
    "in sec .  [ sec : goldstone ] , we reviewed a couple of existing approaches to describe collective modes in the superfluid inner crust of neutron stars .",
    "considering only a uniform neutron gas within the qrpa , one recovers the goldstone mode , which is a longitudinal density wave ( ba sound ) with linear dispersion relation at small @xmath23 , as the lowest lying collective excitation . for a realistic description of the neutron star inner crust ,",
    "however , its crystalline structure should be considered , i.e. it should be described as a lattice of dense clusters surrounded by a neutron gas .",
    "there are several approaches to treat collective excitations of this non - uniform matter involving different kinds of approximations .    in the standard hydrodynamic approach ,",
    "only coarse - grained quantities are considered , i.e. , quantities averaged over many cells .",
    "this leads to an effective low - energy theory , in which the superfluid collective modes with linear dispersion relation are coupled to the dynamics of the crystal lattice . however , this effective theory is only valid at very large wavelengths ( much larger than the periodicity of the lattice , @xmath67 ) , and the determination of its coefficients , especially those involving the so - called entrainment , is difficult .    on the other hand , a qrpa calculation within the ws approximation resolves the microscopic structure of each cell",
    ". however , it gives the lowest lying collective mode at a finite energy .",
    "this is an artefact of treating an isolated cell with a finite radius @xmath48 .",
    "nevertheless the result is very important since it shows that in a non - uniform system , superfluid hydrodynamics may be used at a microscopic level ( i.e. , on length scales smaller than @xmath48 ) as long as the coherence length is sufficiently short , i.e. , pairing is sufficiently strong .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : hydropasta ] , we have presented the approach of superfluid hydrodynamics at a microscopic level in order to develop a model for the collective modes of large and intermediate wavelengths ( i.e. , larger than or comparable with @xmath67 ) . in this model , hydrodynamic equations in the clusters and in the neutron gas were matched at the phase boundaries with boundary conditions allowing neutrons to pass from one phase into the other .",
    "for simplicity , the model has so far only been solved in the phase of plates .",
    "the most striking result is the appearance of an approximately two - dimensional collective mode , which gives a contribution to the specific heat proportional to @xmath185 ( in contrast to the usual @xmath184 behavior ) at low temperatures .",
    "there remain many open questions . in particular , in order to better understand the two - dimensional mode , we are developing an effective theory corresponding to our model in the limit of small @xmath23 .",
    "this could help to clarify some questions concerning entrainment , too,@xcite see the discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec : eft ] .",
    "in addition , we plan to apply our hydrodynamic model to other geometries such as the crystalline phase or the phase of rods .",
    "the latter point is essential in order to make contact with astrophysical observations , since it would allow one to determine heat transport properties in the entire inner crust , necessary for modeling neutron star thermal evolution .",
    "properties of the crust influence the cooling process mainly during the first 50 - 100 years , when the crust stays hotter that the core which cools down very efficiently via neutrino emission ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) .",
    "heat transport in the crust is the key ingredient to explain the afterburst relaxation in x - ray transients , too.@xcite as microscopic ingredients for the models of the thermal relaxation of the crust , in addition to the specific heat , thermal conductivity would be needed , and to less extent neutrino emissivities .",
    "although the contribution of collective modes to heat transport properties exceeds largely that of superfluid quasiparticles , it is to be expected that in almost the whole crust electronic contributions remain dominant , except in presence of a neutron star magnetic field of the order @xmath186 g or higher,@xcite which is the case for many observed neutron stars",
    ". therefore it would be interesting to extend the present model to a magnetised environment , too .",
    "we thank elias khan for providing us with the numerical results of ref .  .",
    "as microscopic input , we need the equation of state , i.e. , the relation between the densities @xmath187 and the chemical potentials @xmath188 . as in ref .",
    ", in our concrete numerical examples , we use the results of the work by avancini et al.@xcite for the equilibrium configurations .",
    "they evaluate the structure of the pasta phases for charge neutral matter in @xmath73 equilibrium using a density dependent relativistic mean - field model , the ddh@xmath189 model ( originally called ddh@xmath190 ) , for the nuclear interaction.@xcite in order to be consistent , we shall calculate the chemical potentials @xmath188 with the same interaction .",
    "the entrainment coefficients within this model , evaluated following the approach in refs .  ,",
    "are given by @xmath191 where @xmath192 denotes the baryon density , @xmath193 and @xmath194 .",
    "the landau effective masses are denoted @xmath195 , not to be confused with the dirac effective masses @xmath196 .",
    "the fermi momenta are represented by @xmath197 and @xmath198 are the meson - nucleon coupling constants of the ddh@xmath189 model , see ref .  .",
    "the term @xmath199 , not present in the expressions given in refs .  , arises from the density dependence of the coupling constants and appears in the landau effective masses , too , @xmath200 and an explicit expression can be found in ref .  .",
