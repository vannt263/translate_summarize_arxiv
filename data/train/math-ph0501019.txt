    "this paper is dedicated to the derivation of new series representations for the incomplete gamma function , which is given by the integral @xmath3    the nice paper by gautschi  @xcite summarizes many properties of the incomplete gamma function and has been used as a valuable reference while writing this paper . since the incomplete gamma function occurrs in a variety of physical and engeneering problems , it is very valuable to obtain analytical series representations .",
    "widely used is , for example , the asymptotic series  @xcite @xmath4 \\ , \\label{eq_2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which can be applied to estimate @xmath5 for large @xmath2 .",
    "other series representations , which are known in the literature , are valid either for small or large values of @xmath2 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to derive new series for the incomplete gamma function , which can be used for arbitrary values of @xmath2 and @xmath1 ; such series could be very useful in dealing with a range of applications in physics and engeneering where the incomplete gamma function emerges .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec_2 ] we describe our method and derive an asymptotic series for @xmath0 , which improves the estimates obtained with eq .",
    "( [ eq_1 ] ) ; in section [ sec_3 ] we generalize the results of section [ sec_2 ] , obtaining a uniformly convergent series representation for @xmath0 , which can then be used to estimate @xmath0 with arbitrary accuracy .",
    "we stress that all the formulas obtained in this paper are fully analytical . in section ( [ sec_4 ] ) we consider two applications of the incomplete gamma function , and discuss the quality of the approximations obtained .",
    "finally in section ( [ sec_5 ] ) we draw our conclusions .",
    "techniques such as the delta expansion and variational perturbation theory have been applied by many authors to physical problems of different nature , ranging from classical and quantum mechanics to field theory ( see for example @xcite and references therein )",
    ". in most cases these methods have allowed to obtain very useful and precise approximate solutions , which are valid even in the non - perturbative regime , where perturbation theory breaks down .",
    "the common idea behind these methods is simple and appealing : to introduce in the problem an arbitrary parameter , to reorganize the expressions by identifying a leading and a perturbative term , both of which dependent upon the arbitrary parameter , and finally to apply perturbation theory . to a finite perturbative order the dependence upon the parameter survives and",
    "its effect is minimized by applying the principle of minimal sensitivity ( pms )  @xcite , which allows to obtain an optimal value of the parameter .",
    "since the parameter determined in this way turns out to be a function of the coupling constants in the problem , the method yields a truly non - perturbative result , i.e. a result which is not polynomial in the coupling constants .",
    "more recently the author has applied these ideas to obtain a new series representation for the riemann zeta function  @xcite .",
    "the series which was found converges much faster than the standard series @xmath6 and provides an analytical formula which is valid for arbitrary @xmath7 .",
    "this formula has also been extended more recently to the critical line  @xcite .",
    "we now come to describe our method : with the purpose of introducing an arbitrary parameter we write the term @xmath8 , appearing in the integral ( [ eq_1 ] ) , as @xmath9 @xmath10 is the arbitrary parameter .",
    "such expansion is valid as long as @xmath11 , i.e. @xmath12 and follows directly from the application of the binomial theorem .    relaxing the constraint of convergence , we use eq .",
    "( [ eq_6 ] ) inside eq .",
    "( [ eq_1 ] ) and obtain @xmath13    notice that we do not expect eq .",
    "( [ eq_7 ] ) to be an exact series representation of the incomplete gamma function , since we have used eq .",
    "( [ eq_6 ] ) outside the region of convergence . for this reason we have used the symbol of approximation in eq .",
    "( [ eq_7 ] ) and we have substituted the upper limit in the sum over @xmath14 , which should be infinite if the series were convergent , with a finite integer value @xmath15 .    although the integrals in eq .",
    "( [ eq_7 ] ) are still incomplete gamma functions , the exponent @xmath16 is now integer and therefore such integrals can be calculated exactly @xmath17    finally we can write eq .",
    "( [ eq_7 ] ) as @xmath18    eq .",
    "( [ eq_9 ] ) constitutes a family of asymptotic series for the incomplete gamma function : if such series were convergent the arbitrary parameter @xmath10 which appears explicitly in the equation , would disappear after performing the infinite sum .",
    "although this is not true in the present case , given the asymptotic nature of the series , we decide to minimize the dependence of the truncated series upon @xmath10 , as prescribed by the pms . in @xcite",
    ", for example , the pms allowed to select a series with a faster rate of convergence .    to first order we",
    "obtain the interesting result @xmath19 .",
    "we thus obtain the series @xmath20    remarkably , to first order , i.e. taking @xmath21 , eq.([eq_10a ] ) gives the approximate formula @xmath22    in fig.([fig_1_1 ] ) our formula ( [ eq_11 ] ) has been compared with the leading order of eq .",
    "( [ eq_2 ] ) by considering the ratio @xmath23 where @xmath24 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq_11 ] ) and @xmath24 is given by the leading order term in eq .",
    "( [ eq_2 ] ) . the better behaviour of our formula , eq .",
    "( [ eq_11 ] ) can be explained noticing that , by expanding it for large values of @xmath2 , we reproduce correctly also the next to leading order in eq .",
    "( [ eq_2 ] ) .     as a function of @xmath2 for fixed values of @xmath1.[fig_1_1],width=302 ]",
    "although eq .  ( [ eq_9 ] ) provides a useful asymptotic representation for the incomplete gamma function , we are interested in obtaining an exact series representation for @xmath0 .",
    "therefore we need to use the expansion eq .",
    "( [ eq_6 ] ) only within the region of convergence and split the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq_1 ] ) into two pieces : @xmath25    the parameter @xmath26 in this expression , although otherwise arbitrary , must be chosen fullfilling the inequality @xmath27 . in the first region",
    "one can apply the expansion ( [ eq_6 ] ) and obtain @xmath28 + \\gamma(a,\\xi \\lambda)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as a result , the incomplete gamma function , evaluated at a given point @xmath2 is obtained in terms of the the incomplete gamma function , evaluated at a larger point @xmath29 , which lies within a maximum distance of @xmath30 .",
    "this procedure can now be easily iterated by resorting to additional arbitrary parameters , but we prefer to fix @xmath10 to the optimal value found previously , i.e. @xmath31 and to define @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "we then obtain @xmath36 \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a uniformly convergent series representation for @xmath0 , which depends upon an arbitrary parameter @xmath26 .",
    "notice that @xmath37 .",
    "although one could invoke once more the pms and optimize the series with respect to @xmath26 , a large gain in simplicity comes from considering @xmath38 , for which one obtains @xmath39 .    in this limit",
    "we obtain the series @xmath40    eq .",
    "( [ eq_14 ] ) constitutes the main result of this paper : when the sums over @xmath14 and @xmath41 are truncated to a finite order this equation provides an analytical approximation to the exact value ; the precision of the approximation will be arbitrarily high for sufficiently large cutoff values of @xmath14 and @xmath41 .",
    "we will call the truncated sum @xmath42 and define the `` reduced '' function @xmath43 where the leading asymptotic behaviour , given by eq .",
    "( [ eq_11 ] ) has been taken out .    in the left plot of figure [ fig_1_2 ]",
    "we compare the numerical values obtained for @xmath44 ( solid thin line ) with the results obtained using the analytical formula corresponding to @xmath45 . in the right plot",
    "we plot the difference between the two curves : the maximum error is found for @xmath46 .     and @xmath47 ;",

    "a first application of the results obtained in this paper concerns the calculation of the probability integral @xmath53 which can be related to the incomplete gamma function by @xmath54    in @xcite bagby provides a simple approximation to @xmath55 , given by : @xmath56\\right\\}^{1/2 } \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in fig .",

    "our analytical formula can be made as precise as we wish , both by raising the values of the cutoffs in the series and by considering higher orders in the incomplete gamma function .",
    "another application of our formula is the calculation of fresnel integrals  @xcite , which naturally occurr in the treatment of diffraction problems : @xmath63 these integrals can be related to the error function by means of the equation @xmath64 where @xmath65 .",
