    "quantum physics allows us a perfect randomness , so most of all quantum information - theoretic primitives try to offer an unconditional security under the randomness . for examples , quantum key distribution protocols such as bb84  @xcite and b92",
    "@xcite highly depend on a random measurements for given classified non - orthogonal quantum states .    instead of the random measurement on non - orthogonal states",
    ", we can consider a direct randomization of quantum states through a quantum channel .",
    "this randomizing procedures are efficiently accomplished via the private quantum channels  ( pqc ) _ or _ quantum one - time pads  @xcite . in the paper we are interest to some schemes for _ approximate _ encryptions  ( no perfect ) and we make an attempt to reducing some classical communication resources .",
    "we would like to call the randomizing procedures or maps as random unitary channels  ( ruc ) in terms of quantum channels .",
    "there are several methods for the approximate randomizing quantum states , for examples ,  @xcite : we here adapt the procedure of hayden et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "many applications of ruc in quantum protocols  ( see e.g. ,  @xcite . ) are started from the approximate version of pqc . here",
    "we will propose new approximate quantum _ state _ sharing  ( aqss ) scheme , which uses two approximate pqcs  ( apqc ) and reduces the classical pre - shared secrets about one - half as compared with a perfect protocol .",
    "actually our protocol could be including the ( well - known ) quantum _ secret _ sharing protocols  @xcite , because a quantum state itself is able to operate special quantum tasks , though those are impossible in the classical power .",
    "imagine that if there is a quantum computer only activated under a bipartite quantum state  ( or _ quantum key _ ) , then our aqss protocol will give a efficient and secure solution for the quantum key .",
    "these approximate quantum state sharing protocols may offer us more opportunities as compared with the quantum secret sharing .",
    "let s take account of the pre - shared secrets for the approximate quantum state sharing protocols under ruc - based pqc roughly .",
    "assume that a sender charlie prepares a quantum state @xmath1  ( two - qudit ) and transmits the state through two independent rucs , then two distant agents alice and bob will receive some output state of including high entropy .",
    "for the state @xmath1 the perfect randomization protocol will require exactly the amount of @xmath2-unitary matrices  ( pauli matrices ) . on the other hand , the construction of hayden et al .",
    "@xcite for our aqss scheme implies that only @xmath3-unitaries sufficient . in other words",
    ", the perfect quantum state sharing protocol needs to @xmath4 bits of pre - shared secret information , while the aqss protocol demands about @xmath5 bits of information .",
    "note that the works in  @xcite will give a similar result for @xmath5 bits bound .",
    "we will prove the information - theoretic security of the aqss scheme in two kinds of eavesdropping : an interior and exterior attackers .",
    "the proof of having higher entropy condition for the exterior attacks is not easy fact , so we split the input state @xmath1 to separable and entangled cases . as a result",
    ", the von neumann entropy in both cases can be chosen sufficiently larger , and a leakage information will be arbitrarily small . finally the authors show that our bipartite aqss scheme naturally can be generalized to an one - sender and multiparty - receivers schemes .    in section  [ sec : ruc ] we introduce the definition of random unitary channels , and briefly mention about special property known as the destruction of quantum states on a product random unitary channel .",
    "we present our aqss protocol based on two approximate pqcs in section  [ sec : aqss ] , and investigate the security of aqss of considering two attacks : an exterior and interior strategies .",
    "we finally conclude our results in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "now let us define the random unitary channel , and then construct an approximate private quantum channels .",
    "for all density matrices @xmath6 , a completely positive trace - preserving map @xmath7 is the so - called _ @xmath0-randomizing _ , if @xmath8 where the trace norm is defined by @xmath9 .",
    "this definition directly induces the notion of random unitary channels .",
    "that is , for every @xmath10 , a quantum channel @xmath7 is called the",
    "_ random unitary channel _ , if @xmath11 is @xmath0-randomizing , where the unitary operators @xmath12 , and the probability @xmath13 s are all positives with @xmath14 . ( the notation @xmath15 denotes the set of bounded linear operators from @xmath16 to itself and @xmath17 the unitary group on @xmath16 . ) note that the parameter @xmath18 is the number of kraus operation elements for ruc , so it corresponds to the dimension of arbitrary environment .    for the approximate constructions of ruc",
    ", it was known that for all @xmath19 there exist random unitary channels in sufficiently larger dimension @xmath20 , such that @xmath18 can be taken to be @xmath21 in  @xcite and @xmath22 in  @xcite where @xmath23 s are chosen randomly according to the haar measure .",
    "we here fix the number @xmath18 of having exactly @xmath24 , the theorem 1 in  @xcite .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , most intuitive application of the random unitary channel is the _ approximate _ private quantum channel  @xcite , which is a modification of the perfect private quantum channel  @xcite via ruc .",
    "the ruc - based apqc is the main tool of constructing the proposed aqss protocol .",
    "approximate private quantum channel : alice applies some @xmath23 s and bob decodes @xmath25 with @xmath26 of having pre - shared @xmath27 bits classical information . ]",
    "the security of pqc is preserved by the argument of the accessible information in which the leakage information is less than @xmath0 .",
    "although small information is leaked to exterior attackers , bob s decoding state is almost equal to alice s original state @xmath10 . the fig .",
    "[ fig : pqc ] describes the total procedure of apqc .    in the next section we use two one - way independent pqcs between a sender charlie and a receiver alice , and the sender charlie and another receiver bob .",
    "let s define two rucs , from the definition of  ( eq .  ( [ eq : ruc ] ) ) , such that @xmath28 where we fix the probability as an equally weighted probabilities @xmath29 and @xmath30 for all @xmath31 , and assume that the number of @xmath32 is equal to @xmath33 , i.e. , @xmath34 .",
    "for an approximate state sharing of any bipartite quantum state , above two channels play an important role in the approximate quantum state sharing scheme .    for given two rucs @xmath35 and @xmath36 , and for all input @xmath1 , we must bound the trace norm for the difference between an output state of the product channel @xmath37 and maximally mixed @xmath38 , such that @xmath39 where a security parameter @xmath0 be a positive less than 1 .",
    "the relation above asserts that all encoding states are information - theoretically secure .",
    "unfortunately , for any entangled states proving the bound is not a simple task .",

    "the last of the section , we briefly describe a multiparty aqss scheme .",
    "let us assume that charlie - alice and charlie - bob have independent two apqcs , and charlie wants to sharing a bipartite quantum state @xmath1 _ securely _ between alice and bob .",
    "approximate qss : if charlie - alice and charlie - bob have shared two independent pqcs each other , then the product channel @xmath37 preserves the security with high probability for any attacks .",
    "the arrow denotes that alice must go to bob s location to obtain the state . ]",
    "the protocol for a bipartite quantum state sharing is simple  ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : qss3 ] ) :    * the sender charlie selects a quantum state @xmath1 and transmits the state through the channel @xmath37 to the receivers alice and bob . * distant two parties alice and bob",
    "just hold the state @xmath43 they received .",
    "* when alice and bob want to reveal the original state @xmath1 , they must cooperate in a single location .",
    "they perform the inverse unitary operations under the locally shared keys .",
    "the security of the aqss protocol is divided two cases of an exterior and interior attacks .",
    "actually the security is based on information - theoretic assumption , which means that the intercepted states must have the higher von neumann entropy .",
    "thus any attackers can not obtain sufficient information for the original states .",
    "first , let us consider an attack accomplished by an exterior eve .",
    "assume that eve intercepts the state @xmath43 .",
    "we here claim that @xmath44\\sim2\\log d\\to\\infty\\ ] ] as @xmath20 goes to infinity .",
    "we do nt know the accurate description for the state @xmath43 for all inputs , so we will divide the state @xmath1 into the separable and entangled one and investigate the behavior each other .    if product state is given , it is possible to infer the inequality eq .",
    "( [ eq : main ] ) easily . by using the triangle inequality with respect to the trace norm for the two rucs , if @xmath45 and @xmath46 , then @xmath47 for @xmath48 .",
    "more formally assume that @xmath49 such that @xmath14 , i.e. , a separable state is given , then @xmath50 \\label{eq : triangle}\\\\      & \\le&2{\\varepsilon } , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the inequalities eq .",
    "( [ eq : normconv ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : triangle ] ) come from the norm convexity and the triangle inequality , respectively  @xcite .",
    "thus any separable inputs for the product channel are very close to the maximally mixed state @xmath51 .",
    "this implies that @xmath52 $ ] is close to @xmath53 .    for the separable input cases",
    ", there is another bound that depends on the dimension parameter @xmath20 and @xmath18 : we can prove that the expectation value for the difference between the channel output and the maximally mixed state ( with respect to the trace norm ) is very close , that is , @xmath54 where @xmath55 denotes the total expectation value of @xmath56 and @xmath57 for the independent rucs @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "the appendix in this paper states that the inequality eq .",
    "( [ eq : exp2ruc ] ) is non - trivial and obtained precisely by exploiting the relation between the trace norm and the hilbert - schmidt norm . as mentioned above ,",
    "let s take @xmath58 and @xmath59 , then @xmath60 this implies that eve s attack is impossible in principle .",
    "what can we do for an entangled input state ?",
    "though a direct proof could be impossible , there is an evidence for the statement , the eq .",
    "( [ eq:2logd ] ) . the theorem iii.3 in  @xcite states that , for a positive operator - valued measure  ( povm ) @xmath61 which is implemented using local operation and classical communication  ( locc ) , @xmath62 , where @xmath63 and @xmath64 with a maximally entangled state s.t . @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "natural extension is possible as adding the channel @xmath36 : define @xmath67 and @xmath68 , then also @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , we can conclude the state @xmath43 is close to @xmath51 under the locc - implemented povm . in this reason",
    "any input state @xmath1 through the product channel @xmath37 have high entropy for @xmath69 .",
    "second , we must consider a situation when alice _ or _ bob is malicious .",
    "assume that bob intercepts the alice s state @xmath70 , bob s decoded state looks like @xmath71 where @xmath72 denotes the inverse operation for bob s ruc @xmath36 , but @xmath73 $ ] has still high entropy values .",
    "the intercepted state @xmath74 is still almost maximally mixed state by the definition of the ruc @xmath70 . as a result",
    ", bob can not obtain any information for @xmath75 without charlie - alice s key information .",
    "symmetrically alice s attack is useless .",
    "in other words , the charlie s aim of sharing a quantum state @xmath1 between alice and bob will be securely accomplished .",
    "at least above - mentioned two attacks  ( exterior and interior eavesdropping ) can not break the security of the proposed aqss protocol .",
    "so the cooperation between alice and bob always restores the original state approximately .    in the proposed scenarios ,",
    "the perfect protocol for quantum state sharing requires exactly @xmath76 unitary operators , while our protocol only needs to total @xmath77 unitaries for sufficiently larger @xmath20 .",
    "this fact directly means that some pre - shared key bits are reduced by factor 2 , since the aqss is needed @xmath78 secret bits , but the perfect qss is required @xmath2 bits . for any state @xmath79 , and for any channel @xmath80  ( for an @xmath19 is arbitrary ) , let s consider a relation like that @xmath81 then , it is sufficient to construct the perfect qss  ( @xmath82 ) with @xmath76 pauli operators for the channel @xmath80 in the sense of pqc  @xcite . in the case of our approximate qss , the product channel of two rucs  ( @xmath83 ) just consume of half secret bits , so we say that it is _ efficient _ in weak sense  ( though small information is always leaking ) .    without loss of generality , a direct extension of the bipartite quantum state sharing protocol  ( eq .  ( [ eq : exp2ruc ] ) )",

    "( [ eq : maqss ] ) implies that any exterior attacks will be failed .",
    "furthermore all interior attacks  ( including group conspiracy ) will be frustrated to obtain the whole state without others secrets , it has similar reason to the two receivers protocol . let s look at the cost of secret bits for the maqss scheme",
    ". roughly speaking , the perfect scheme requires @xmath90 secret bits , but maqss only @xmath91-bits sufficient .",
    "we studied that the approximate quantum state sharing schemes are efficient from the classical information cost of view and those are robust to the two kinds of attacks .",
    "the proposed aqss protocol basically depends on an approximate private quantum channel , which is constructed via two independent random unitary channels .",
    "although the protocol leaks small information corresponding to the security parameter @xmath0 , the scheme preserves its information - theoretic security , and so the aqss and maqss schemes can be interpreted as some high - efficiency state sharing protocols for any bipartite and multipartite quantum states .",
