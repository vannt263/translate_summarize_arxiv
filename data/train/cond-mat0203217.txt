    "it is now well established , from the study of many relativistic theories of massless fermions in the presence of an external magnetic field , that a magnetic field can be a strong catalyst for chiral symmetry breaking with the consequent generation of a fermion dynamical mass even at the weakest attractive interaction among fermions @xcite .",
    "this magnetic catalysis ( mc ) of chiral symmetry breaking has proven to be universal , its main features being independent of the model under consideration ( see refs .",
    "@xcite@xmath0@xcite for various aspects of this phenomenon ) .",
    "the universality character of the magnetic catalysis has motivated many recent works @xcite-@xcite aimed to apply it to diverse areas of quantum physics .",
    "the essence of the mc effect lies in the dimensional reduction of the fermion pairing dynamics due to the confinement of these particles to their lowest landau level ( lll ) , when the pairing energy is much less than the landau gap @xmath1 ( @xmath2 is the magnitude of the magnetic field induction ) . under these circumstances , any attraction between fermions , whenever small it might be , is strengthened by the effective dimensional reduction in the presence of the magnetic field , and therefore , a condensate of fermion - antifermion is formed with the subsequent generation of a fermion mass .",
    "the lowest ll plays in this case a role similar to that of the fermi surface in bcs superconductivity @xcite .",
    "it is known that several quasiplanar systems have low - energy excitation spectrum of quasiparticles ( qp ) , characterized by a linear dispersion , around the fermi surface consisting of isolated points .",
    "the dynamics of these qp can be described by a `` relativistic '' quantum field theory of massless fermions .",
    "when such dirac - like qp are electrically charged , they can couple to an externally applied magnetic field which can catalyze the condensation of qp - antiqp pairs .",
    "then , one would expect the realization of mc in such a kind of condensed matter systems . as a matter of fact",
    ", the mc was suggested as the possible explanation @xcite@xmath0@xcite for the profile of the thermal conductivity in an applied magnetic field observed in recent experiments in planar high-@xmath3 cuprates @xcite@xmath0@xcite .",
    "the mc has also been proposed @xcite as the source of the semimetal - insulator phase transition observed in the so - called highly oriented pyrolitic graphites ( hopg ) @xcite in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "given that the heat transport is a convenient probe to understand many basic properties of quasi - planar condensed matter systems , as gap structure , qp density , scattering rate , etc , the study of heat transport in a quasiplanar system subjected to mc may turn out physically revealing . it is the goal of the present paper to study how the mc affects the thermal transfer properties of a ( 2 + 1)-dimensional fermion system under an applied constant magnetic field . in particular , we calculate the thermal conductivity of a system of qp described by a ( 2 + 1)-dimensional nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model which exhibits a mass ( gap ) generation for fermions in the presence of a magnetic field , and discuss possible applications to planar condensed matter systems . to obtain the results here",
    "reported , we used the same approximation of a constant magnetic field that was already explored in refs.@xcite .",
    "however , our calculations deviate considerably from what was done in these papers .",
    "not only we take into account the contribution of all landau levels , but the definition we use for the heat current itself is different . in our formulation , when the gap induced by the magnetic field is opened , the thermal conductivity exhibits a new term proportional to @xmath4 ( @xmath5 is the gap ) . near the phase transition point , the gap behaves like @xmath6 in the mean - field approximation . hence ,",
    "the term proportional to @xmath4 yields a positive contribution in the slope of the thermal conductivity , leading to a jump in the slope of @xmath7 at @xmath8 ( kink - like behavior ) . notice that the magnetic catalysis is mainly responsible for the kink effect , being the critical behavior of the gap an essential factor for this result .",
    "we underline that to obtain such a kink - like behavior , it is crucial to go beyond the lll contribution in the calculation of the thermal conductivity , since , as we show , the heat transfer takes place due to transitions between neighboring lls . physically , this is easy to understand keeping in mind that the spatial momentum of the qp lies in the system plane . in the presence of a magnetic field",
    "perpendicularly applied to the two - dimensional sample , the qp spatial momentum is purely transverse and hence quantized into discrete landau levels .",
    "therefore , the transfer of kinetic energy can only occur by means of transitions between landau levels .",
    "even though our results were obtained by using a particular model , we point out that the main outcome of the present work is of a more general and theoretical character , as we show that the mc phenomenon can be responsible for a kink - like effect in the thermal conductivity of a whole class of ( 2 + 1)-dimensional relativistic fermion systems .",
    "that is , we show that the kink effect is essentially model independent , since it is determined by the critical behavior of the dynamically generated mass near the phase transition point .",
    "this fact makes the basic outcome of our investigation relevant beyond the particular model under consideration , linking it to the universality class of theories with such a critical behavior . in connection with this",
    "we conjecture that , since the hopg may be described @xcite by a model that belongs to the same universality class as that of the model used here , the hopg thermal conductivity in the presence of a magnetic field should display similar kink - like behavior .    the plan of the paper is as follows . in sec .",

    "we corroborate what we had already argued in section 2 based on the analytic result found for @xmath44 : due to the appearance of @xmath21 at a critical field that depends on the temperature , @xmath44 exhibits a kink behavior in its profile with the magnetic field .",

    "a main outcome of our investigation is that the relevant properties of the thermal conductivity of the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional relativistic qp system around the critical point are model independent .",
    "indeed , the essential ingredient of the effective model required to produce the kink - like effect in the thermal conductivity is the critical behavior of the dynamical mass induced by mc near the phase transition , so not much depends on the concrete form of the effective lagrangian .",

    "let us recall that hopg materials @xcite have layered structure with two isolated points in the brillouin zone where the dispersion is linear .",

    "the characteristic feature of @xmath15-wave superconductors is also the existence of nodal points ( four in this case ) where the order parameter vanishes , thus the fermi surface consists of four isolated points with excitations around them being well - defined gapless quasiparticles ( qp )",

    "nevertheless , the mechanism of generating a kink - like effect in the thermal conductivity via the mc phenomenon , as studied in the previous sections , should be relevant for condensed matter systems with dirac - like charged qp on which landau level quantization is feasible . in this direction",

    "@xcite,@xcite , the physical picture underlying the description of superconducting cuprates may involve the interplay of two different phases with their corresponding order parameters : one @xmath241 superconducting ( dsc ) and one of density wave order ( ddw ) .",
    "the ddw state , unlike the dsc state , does not break gauge invariance , so the quasiparticles of the ddw state can form landau levels under an applied magnetic field @xcite .",
    "although the above scenario is still speculative and more experimental confirmation is required , one can venture that given that the charged qp excitations around the nodes of the ddw order parameter have landau levels , they can be subjected to a mc phase transition at some critical magnetic field , and hence our theoretical results could be relevant in that case for the description of the heat transport properties of the ddw - state in the magnetic field .",
