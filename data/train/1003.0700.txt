    "the photoproduction of hyperons off the nucleon target , @xmath8 is important in hadron physics because it reveals the strangeness - related interaction structures of hadrons .",
    "there have been abundant experimental and theoretical efforts dedicated to it .",
    "many experimental collaborations , such as clas at jafferson laboratory  @xcite , leps at spring-8  @xcite , etc , have performed energetic research activities for the @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 photoproductions . up to the resonance region",
    "@xmath12 gev , a simple hadronic model including the tree - level diagrams with the nucleon and the certain resonance intermediate states has successfully explained the experimental data  @xcite .",

    "however , this simple model is hardly applied to high - energy regions , because it is only valid at relatively low energy . on the other hand",
    ", it is well known that various reactions at high energy and low momentum transfer have been well described by regge theory . therefore , to extend our model to higher energy without the sacrifice of the satisfactory description of the low energy data , mesonic regge trajectories , corresponding to all the meson exchanges with the same quantum numbers but different spins in the @xmath3 channel at tree level ,",
    "were employed  @xcite .",
    "this regge description is supposed to be valid in the limit @xmath13  @xcite . even in the resonance region , it has been argued that the regge description is still applicable to a certain extent  @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we investigate the @xmath0 photoproduction off the proton target , @xmath14 , beyond the resonance region with an extended model including the original hadronic model and the interpolated regge contributions .",
    "this reaction has been intensively studied by clas and leps collaborations recently . as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , up to the resonance region , this production process is largely dominated by the contact - term contribution . this interesting feature supported by the experiments",
    "@xcite is a consequence of gauge invariance in a certain description for spin-@xmath15 fermions , i.e. the rarita - schwinger formalism  @xcite .",
    "the contact - term dominance simplifies the analyses of the production process to a great extent .",
    "for instance , according to it , 1 ) one can expect a significant difference in the production strengths between the proton- and neutron - target experiments as long as the coupling strength @xmath16 is small  @xcite , and 2 ) the computation of the polarization - transfer coefficients is almost without any unknown parameter  @xcite .",
    "to date , there have been only a few experimental data of the @xmath17 photoproduction off the proton target   @xcite . among them , barber et al . for lamp2 collaboration",

    "however , at @xmath20 gev as done by boyarski et al .",
    "@xcite , this simple model fails in the forward region .",
    "nevertheless it still agrees with the data qualitatively well beyond @xmath21 . to solve this discrepancy in the high - energy forward region",
    ", we are motivated to introduce the regge description which contributes significantly in the limit @xmath22 by construction .",
    "assuming that the regge contributions still remain non negligible in the limit @xmath23 , we introduce an interpolating ansatz between the two ends . after fixing the parameters including a cutoff mass for the form factors , it is straightforward to calculate all the physical observables .",
