    "one of the key questions concerning the formation of planets , and our own earth in particular , is how water has evolved on its way from collapsing molecular cloud cores , to protoplanetary disks and _ eventually _ earth s oceans . in cold and quiescent regions ,",
    "the gas - phase water abundance is low , only @xmath7 or less ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but in regions forming low - mass protostars with intense heating or active shocks , its abundance can reach 10@xmath8 with respect to h@xmath0 - comparable to or higher than that of co ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . thus , in the earliest prestellar stages and in large parts of the dense envelopes around low - mass protostars , h@xmath0o is largely frozen out and the dominant constituent of the icy mantles of dust grains .",
    "it is thought that the amount of deuterated relative to non - deuterated water is established in these grain mantles .",
    "observations show that this abundance ratio is enhanced in comets ( @xmath9 ; e.g. , @xcite ) and earth s oceans ( @xmath10 ; e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) relative to primordial d / h ratio in the protosolar nebula ( @xmath11  1.5@xmath12 ; @xcite ) .",
    "determining when and where this ratio is established is thus a potentially important way to trace the evolution of water in the different stages of star formation .",
    "in particular , it might help determine what fraction of water was brought to earth at later times through cometary impacts compared to being accreted during the formation of the planet itself ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) and whether water undergoes signficant processing in warm regions of protostellar envelopes or disks before reaching newly formed planets .",
    "previous attempts at measuring the ratio of hdo and h@xmath0o in low - mass protostars have had mixed success .",
    "direct attempts to detect hdo in the solid phase at infrared wavelengths have provided upper limits of [ hdo]/[h@xmath0o ] varying from 0.005 to 0.02 in a sample of protostars @xcite , which are not strong constraints compared to the two orders of magnitude lower abundance ratios observed in , e.g. , the cometary systems about two orders of magnitude lower .",
    "measurements at ( sub)millimeter wavelengths could potentially be sensitive to lower abundances of hdo in the gas - phase in regions where the ices have evaporated off the dust grains and thus trace their compositions indirectly , but such measurements are complicated due to the achievable angular resolution using single - dish radio telescopes and have led to discrepant results . as an example , @xcite and @xcite analyzed the hdo emission toward the deeply embedded protostar , iras  16293 - 2422 compared to previous iso and swas observations of non - deuterated h@xmath0o . both presented detailed models for the hdo abundance structure with significantly different results : @xcite found evidence for a drop in the [ hdo]/[h@xmath0o ] ratio from 0.03 in the hot gas in the inner envelope ( i.e. , significantly enhanced above the cometary values ) to @xmath130.002 in the cold gas on larger scales , whereas @xcite in contrast found that the abundance of hdo was best described as being constant throughout the envelope and with a [ hdo]/[h@xmath0o ] ratio of 2@xmath14 , comparable to the cometary value , in the part of the envelope with @xmath15  k. part of this discrepancy may arise due to the complexities in comparisons between ground - based single - dish observations of hdo and space - based observations of h@xmath0o probing signicantly different spatial scales - and lines excited in different regions of the protostellar environment .",
    "our detection of thermal h@xmath3o emission toward the deeply embedded class 0 low - mass protostar , ngc  1333-iras4b ( @xmath16  pc ) , with the iram plateau de bure interferometer @xcite makes it possible to revisit the discussion of the origin of water on earth - namely where the relative abundances of deuterated and non - deuterated are established .",
    "in this letter we present a search for the 225.9  ghz @xmath1 transition of the hdo isotopologue at high - angular resolution ( 2.53@xmath17 ; corresponding to 625700  au ) using the submillimeter array ( sma ) .",
    "this transition is close in energy to the h@xmath3o @xmath18 transition from @xcite ( @xmath19  k vs. 204  k ) and a straightforward comparison can thus be made between these species with minimal uncertainties due to their excitation properties .",
    "we observed ngc  1333-iras4b ( iras4b in the following ; @xmath20=032912.00 , @xmath21=+3113081 [ j2000 ] @xcite ) using the submillimeter array ( sma ; @xcite ) on 2008 october 31 .",
    "the receivers were tuned to the hdo @xmath22 transition at 225.89672  ghz and the sma correlator assigned a chunk with 512 channels centered on this line corresponding to a 0.27  km  s@xmath23  spectral resolution over about 100  mhz of the chunk .",
    "the chunk was placed so that the upper sideband covered the d@xmath0co transition at 236.102128  ghz with similar spectral resolution . for the remaining sma passband",
    "128 channels were allocated in each chunk giving a uniform spectral coverage of 1.1  km  s@xmath23  from 225.0 ghz to 227.0  ghz ( lsb ) and 235.0 to 237.0  ghz ( usb ) .",
    "the source was observed in the compact configuration of the sma , which at the time of observations had 7 antennae operational providing baselines ranging from 7 to 60  k@xmath24 .",
    "the data were calibrated using the sma version of the mir package and imaged using miriad .",
    "the calibration followed the standard approach : the absolute flux calibration was established through observations of uranus , the bandpass by observations of the strong quasar 3c454.3 and the complex gains by regular observations of the nearby strong quasars 3c84 and 3c111 ( approximately 5.2 and 4.7  jy at 1.33  mm , respectively ) .",
    "integrations with clearly deviating amplitudes and/or phases were flagged and the continuum was subtracted prior to fourier transformation of the line data . with natural weighting",
    "the resulting beam size is 3.1@xmath25 2.5at a position angle of -66@xmath26 ; the field of view is 52  ( hpbw ) at 1.33  mm .",
    "the resulting rms noise level is 58  mjy  beam@xmath23  channel@xmath23 for the line data with the 0.27  km  s@xmath23  spectral resolution using natural weighting .",
    "both iras4b and its nearby companion iras4b@xmath27 are clearly detected in the continuum data .",
    "table  [ cont_table ] lists the results of elliptical gaussian fits to the two sources : both are resolved with fluxes in agreement with the results from @xcite within the absolute flux calibration uncertainty of 20% .",

    "the h@xmath0co @xmath30 transition at 225.698  ghz is clearly dominant as expected , with lines of complex organic molecules as well as oc@xmath31s and c - c@xmath32h@xmath0 also detected .",
    "most importantly the identification of the multiple lines centered at the continuum position confirms both the pointing of the observations as well as the calibration of the frequency axes of the spectra .",
    "[ spectrum_zoom ] shows a zoom - in on the spectrum in the high resolution chunk around the hdo @xmath22 transition .",
    "no clear line is seen at the systemic velocity of 7.0  km  s@xmath23  of the h@xmath3o @xmath33 transition @xcite and other species surveyed at high angular resolution with the sma @xcite - although a tentative detection may be present at the @xmath63@xmath5 level ( integrated intensity ) .",
    "this is confirmed by the integrated intensity map ( fig .",
    "[ spectrum_zoom ] , right ) , which shows a 3@xmath5 contour close to the location of the continuum peak . statistically speaking it",
    "can not be counted a firm detection , however , and we therefore treat it as an upper limit in the following .",
    "the @xmath34 upper limit on the integrated line intensity ( or approximate strength of the tentative detection ) of the hdo transition can be estimated as @xmath35  jy  km  s@xmath23 , assuming a line width to zero intensity of 2  km  s@xmath23  as found for the h@xmath3o transition .",
    "the column density of hdo corresponding to this intensity can be estimated under the same assumptions as for the h@xmath3o transition - and can thus be compared directly , assuming that the emission is optically thin and uniform over the extent of the h@xmath3o emission ( thus diluted in our sma beam ) .    using the non - lte escape probability code radex @xcite we calculated column densities corresponding to the observed line intensities for different values of the kinetic temperature and h@xmath0 density .",
    "[ radex_calculation ] shows the derived hdo / h@xmath0o abundance ratio as function of kinetic temperature and density , respectively . in the range from about 100 to 1000  k and for densities larger than about @xmath36",
    "@xmath37 ( the density expected in the inner envelope or disk ) the derived [ hdo]/[h@xmath0o ] 3@xmath5 upper limit on the abundance ratio varies from about 2@xmath4 to 6@xmath4 assuming an ortho - para ratio for h@xmath3o of 3:1 and a @xmath38o/@xmath39o ratio of 560 . if the tentative detection would be confirmed by more sensitive observations , the implied hdo / h@xmath0 abundance ratio would suggest a level of deuteration comparable to what is observed in cometary ices . the radex calculations show that the inferred abundance ratio can vary from about 1@xmath4 to 1@xmath40 if the excitation temperatures are allowed to differ for the two species and vary between 100 and 1000  k , covering a wider range of physical parameters .",
    "the beauty of the above result is that it does not depend on the assumed physical structure of the source - and in particular , whether the origin of the observed water is due to shocks or ice desorption in either envelope or disk material .",
    "one caveat is that the h@xmath3o transition could be masing as is the case for the same transition of main h@xmath41o isotologue at 183  ghz ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in that scenario the h@xmath3o column density would be overestimated and thus the [ hdo]/[h@xmath0o ] ratio underestimated .",
    "a few observational facts argue against this being a major issue for the h@xmath3o transition toward iras4b , though : the width of the h@xmath3o transition ( 2  km  s@xmath23  to zero - intensity ) is very close to those of the other species ( so@xmath0 , c@xmath0h@xmath42cn and ch@xmath32och@xmath32 ) observed in the central beam toward the continuum peak of iras4b .",
    "this trend is further strengthened with detections of the h@xmath3o transition toward two other embedded protostars ( m.  persson et al .",
    ", in prep . )",
    ": the lines of h@xmath3o , so@xmath0 and the organic species in these three sources show smaller species - to - species variations than source - to - source variations both in terms of their line widths and strengths .",
    "this suggests that the origin of the emission is the same in each of the individual sources and therefore that h@xmath3o emission is dominated by the thermal component and at most weakly masing . finally , previously detected h@xmath0o water masers at 22  ghz in iras4b are clearly offset from the systemic velocity @xcite and their motions in the outflow propagation direction are perpendicular to the tentative velocity gradient observed in the h@xmath3o transition",
    ". thus , the h@xmath3o line is at least not masing in the gas where the 22  ghz h@xmath0o maser has its origin .",
    "the derived upper limit to the hdo / h@xmath0o abundance ratio does not support the suggestion by @xcite and @xcite that the hdo / h@xmath0o abundance ratio is abnormally high in low - mass protostars or their disks compared to the abundance ratios found in comets , earth s oceans or in high - mass hot core regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in agreement with @xcite , the results favor a scenario in which the hdo / h@xmath0o ratio is conserved during the star formation process .",
    "there is thus also no need to invoke the formation of water in the gas - phase in a longer - lived early stage of low - mass protostars where the deuterium fractionation is high to explain the constraints on the hdo / h@xmath0o abundance ratio .",
    "the conclusion that the hdo / h@xmath0o abudance ratio is determined in the cold core phase and is conserved throughout the formation of low - mass stars and icy solar - system bodies is consistent with the evolutionary models of @xcite that show that the bulk of the ice remains in solid form during infall and disk formation .",
    "it is possible that the physical mechanisms for the origin of the warm gas in ngc  1333-iras4b and iras  16293 - 2422 differ : the latter source shows a complex structure with multiple organic species peaking at different locations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and likely interaction with the protostellar outflow on small scales @xcite .",
    "sma observations of that source ( j.  k. jrgensen et al .",
    ", in prep . )",
    "suggests that this complex interplay could also have an impact on the line emission for the hdo isotopologue underlining the need for high angular resolution observations .    in any case",
    ", these observations have shown the great potential offered by high angular resolution submillimeter ( interferometric ) observations , even from the ground , for tracing the origin and evolution of water vapor during the evolution of young stars .",
    "an important step forward would be to spatially resolve both the emission profiles of hdo and h@xmath3o in protostars in different evolutionary stages to reveal any temporal or spatial variations of their abundance ratios .",
    "more sensitive observations with the plateau de bure as well as future observations with the atacama large millimeter array in band 5 will make this possible and thereby make an important contribution toward answering the questions about the origin of water in planetary systems .",
