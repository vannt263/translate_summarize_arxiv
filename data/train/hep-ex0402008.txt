    "in the last few years it has become clear that neutrinos have non - vanishing masses , and that the neutrino flavor eigenstates ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) are superpositions of mass eigenstates ( @xmath8 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) , giving rise to neutrino oscillations . for recent reviews ,",
    "see @xcite . in this context",
    ", neutrinos can undergo radiative decays , e.g. @xmath9 , as initially suggested in @xcite ; the first searches for such decays were based on astrophysical considerations ( see eg .",
    "the status of the decaying theory and phenomenology was summarized in @xcite .",
    "radiative decays are allowed if the involved neutrinos have a non - vanishing magnetic dipole moment ; the very stringent existing experimental limits ( @xmath10 @xcite ) refer to the neutrino flavor eigenstates and are not directly applicable to possible dipole magnetic moments of neutrino mass eigenstates .",
    "neutrino decays ( radiative or not ) have been searched for indirectly ( from astrophysical arguments such as supernova physics or the absence of @xmath11 rays in the sun radiation , or from ir background measurements ) , by re - interpreting solar and atmospheric neutrino data from large experiments , as well as directly ( experiments near nuclear reactors , analysis with cosmic ray detectors or during total solar eclipses ) .",
    "all published searches yield lower limits for the neutrino lifetimes , which are strongly sensitive to the assumed neutrino mass and mass hierarchy scenario .",
    "the astrophysical neutrino lifetime lower limits are usually large ( e.g. @xmath12 s ev@xmath13 where @xmath14 is the lower proper lifetime limit for a neutrino of mass @xmath15 , @xcite ) , but they are indirect and rather speculative limits .    much lower  semi - indirect \" limits were deduced from the re - interpretation of solar and atmospheric neutrino data .",
    "earlier attempts to explain the solar neutrino or atmospheric neutrino anomalies only in terms of neutrino decay have been ruled out by the existing evidence @xcite ; the present accepted explanations are based on neutrino oscillations , but do not exclude the hypothesis of neutrino decays . as an example , from the sno data @xcite a proper lower limit of @xmath16 s ev@xmath13 was deduced @xcite . by analyzing all available solar neutrino data , other limits were obtained : @xmath17 s ev@xmath13 for the msw solution , and @xmath18 s ev@xmath13 for the vacuum oscillation solution of the solar neutrino problem ( snp ) @xcite , or , following a different approach , @xmath19 s ev@xmath13 @xcite .    direct searches for radiative neutrino decays have been also performed . as an example we quote here the search for decay photons in the visible spectrum performed in the vicinity of a nuclear reactor @xcite , yielding @xmath20 lower limits in the range @xmath21 to nearly 0.1 s ev@xmath13 , assuming neutrino relative mass differences @xmath22 between 10@xmath23 and 0.1 .",
    "recently , a search for @xmath11 photons , using the prototype borexino detector at gran sasso @xcite reported @xmath20 lower limits of @xmath24 s ev@xmath13 ( assuming a polarization parameter @xmath25 for the parent neutrino ) , @xmath26 s ev@xmath13 ( for @xmath27 ) and @xmath28 s ev@xmath13 ( for @xmath29 ) .    in a pioneering experiment performed during the total solar eclipse ( tse ) of october 24 , 1995",
    "a search was made for visible photons emitted through radiative decays of solar neutrinos during their flight between the moon and the earth @xcite . in their analysis",
    ", the authors assumed that all neutrinos have masses of the order of few ev , @xmath30 ev@xmath31 , and an average energy of 860 kev .",
    "furthermore they assumed that all decays would lead to visible photons , which would travel nearly in the same direction as the parent neutrinos , thus leading to a narrow spot of light coming from the direction of the center of the dark disk of the moon . in the absence of a positive signal ,",
    "this search yielded a lower proper lifetime of 97 s , for neutrinos with @xmath32   few ev @xcite .",
    "some of the authors of this paper were involved in two similar experiments , during the total solar eclipses of august 11 , 1999 ( in romania ) @xcite , and of june 21 , 2001 ( in zambia ) @xcite .    in 1999",
    "the bad weather conditions did not allow the planned observations with the properly designed experimental apparata ; but we could analyse the images of a videotape recorded by a local romanian television ( rmnicu vlcea ) .",
    "the study of the data was performed in the hypothesis of a possible decay @xmath33 with @xmath34 , and for two values of @xmath35 suggested by the msw sma ( small mixing angle ) and lma ( large mixing angle ) solutions of the snp , allowed by the then available data from solar neutrino experiments .",
    "we developed a monte carlo ( mc ) simulation of radiative solar neutrino decays , considering the neutrino energy spectrum predicted by the standard solar model ( ssm ) @xcite and the mass of the @xmath8 in the range of 1 - 10 ev , as it was expected at that time .",
    "since the angular resolution of the data was not very good , we considered the sun as a pointlike source .",
    "the simulation has shown that the expected signal would be a narrow spot of light in the direction of the center of the sun , and allowed an evaluation of the fraction of decays yielding visible photons as function of the chosen neutrino @xmath8 mass , @xmath36 , and @xmath35 values .",
    "the lower limits obtained from the 1999 tse range between @xmath37 s ev@xmath38 s ev@xmath13",
    ".    it may be worth to mention that the particle data group best fit lower limit for the neutrino lifetime , in the printed version of 2002 was @xmath39 s ev@xmath13 , while in the 2003 partial upgrade the best fit is only 300 s ev@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present the results obtained from the analysis of our 2001 tse observations .",
    "this experiment allowed the collection of better resolution data , so the real spatial distribution of the solar neutrino yield had to be considered .",
    "the recent sno results @xcite favor the lma solution and indicate also the presence of a @xmath7 component in the solar neutrino flux at the earth level .",
    "furthermore , they indicate a possible lower limit for the sum of the neutrino masses of about @xmath40 ev .",
    "the wmap ( wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ) results after the first year flight , assuming three degenerate neutrino species @xcite limit the mass of the neutrino to @xmath41 ev ( 95% cl ) .",
    "the new monte carlo simulation code developed for the analysis of our 2001 data was described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "it is based on the latest updates of the standard solar model @xcite and on a full 3-d geometry of the solar neutrino production , decay and photon detection , as initially proposed in @xcite .",
    "the experimental data used for this search consist of two sets of digital images , obtained with two different instruments and different exposures , magnifications and resolutions , during the tse of june 21@xmath0 2001 . for the observation we have chosen a location 50 km north of lusaka , zambia , in the vicinity of a farm that could provide electrical power .",
    "the site was located at 14@xmath4256 lat .",
    "s , 28@xmath4214 long .",
    "e , and at an altitude of about 1200 m a.s.l .",
    "the distance to the centrality line was approximately 8 km .",
    "one data set ( referred to as  set a `` ) consists in 4149 frames obtained from a digital film made with a video - camera equipped with a @xmath43 telelens and a @xmath44 optical zoom .",
    "the recording rate was 25 frames per second .",
    "the field of view of each pixel of the ccd camera was 9.97 '' @xmath45 10.74 \" ( arcsec ) .",
    "the second data set ( that will be referred to as  set b `` ) consists in 10 digital photographs made with a matsukov - cassegrain telescope ( 90 mm @xmath46 and f = 1250 mm ) , coupled to a digital camera .",
    "the camera was set to emulate a photographic film of 400 asa sensitivity .",
    "the exposure time for each image was 2 s , and the digital camera automatically adjusted the aperture as function of the luminosity of the solar corona .",
    "we took into consideration this effect in our analysis . in order to avoid systematic effects due to the optical system or to the ccd",
    ", we slightly changed the orientation of the telescope from one frame to another .",
    "the field of view of each pixel of the ccd was 1.14 '' @xmath45 1.14 \" .    for both data sets and for each image",
    ", we determined the center of the dark disk of the moon .",
    "the signal of a possible radiative decay of solar neutrinos during their flight from the moon to the earth should be correlated to the position of the center of the sun .",
    "the totality phase of the tse at the observation point lasted about @xmath47 minutes , so the center of the sun continuously changed its position with respect to the center of the dark disk of the moon .",
    "in equatorial coordinates , the velocity components ( declination and ascension ) of the relative movement of the moon center with respect to the sun center were : @xmath48``/s and @xmath49''/s .",
    "as the angle between the  horizontal \" x - axis of our images and the ecliptic was about 53@xmath50 , we computed the  x \" and  y `` components of the relative velocity of the center of the moon with respect to the sun center : @xmath51''/s and @xmath52\" / s .",
    "the distance ( in arcsec ) between the two centers was computed for any time @xmath53 from the start of the totality , knowing that at @xmath54 the moon and the sun centers were coincident .",
    "this allowed us to know , for each image , the shift ( in pixels ) between the moon center and the center of the sun , and thus the displacement to apply to the images before adding one to another .",
    "the procedure to search for possible signals in each data set is based on the wavelet decomposition of each of the two total images , and we retained as useful data only the larger dyadic squares around the center of the sun . in the case of set a , the dimension of this square is @xmath55 pixels@xmath31 , while for set b is @xmath56 pixels@xmath31 .",
    "1 illustrates this procedure for a typical image of data set b. the border of the dark moon disk is obtained by requiring a variation of 100 aquisition digital units ( adu ) from a pixel to the next one .",
    "the resulting shape is then fit to a circle .",
    "the border pixels and the fit circle are shown in fig .",
    "the position of the center of the sun with respect to the center of the moon is calculated as a function of the time at which the photo was made ; it is represented in fig . 1 by the small cross in the middle of the image . the @xmath56 pixels@xmath31 area , centered on the center of the sun ,",
    "is then obtained for each picture ( the solid rectangle in fig .",
    "1 ) ; all the similar zones of the 10 pictures are summed toghether for further processing .",
    "the relative displacement of the sun center from the beginning to the end of data taking is indicated in fig . 1 by the small points at the center of the field ; a @xmath56 pixels@xmath31 rectangle centered on the center of the moon is also drawn ( the dotted square ) .",
    "this procedure was applied to all digital video frames of data set a and to all digital photographs of data set b ; the sums were then computed for each color channel ( red , green and blue ) and for their sum ( the  white \" channel ) .",
    "the mc simulations of the solar neutrino radiative decays @xcite , @xmath57 , assuming @xmath58 ev@xmath31 , @xmath59 ev , indicate that the expected signal in the optical band should consist in a narrow luminosity peak ( about 50 `` wide ) in the direction of the center of the sun .",
    "if the @xmath2 mass eigenstate is also present in the solar neutrino flux at the earth , the @xmath60 decays , with @xmath61 ev@xmath31 , would yield a broader signal ( about 250 '' ) , possibly showing some  rings \" at 200 - 300 arcseconds , concentric to the position of the center of the sun .",
    "most of the background light ( diffraction of the coronal light on the borders of the moon , diffuse sky light , ashen light ( light reflected by the earth on the surface of the moon ) , etc . ) , are characterized by larger angular scales .",
    "thus the wavelet decomposition of the compound images is a proper tool to search for a possible decay signal .",
    "we used the simple haar wavelet basis @xcite .",
    "the @xmath62-order term of the decomposition is obtained by dividing the @xmath63 pixels@xmath31 image in square fields of @xmath64 pixels@xmath31 and averaging the luminosity in each field ; the averages are then removed and the resulting image , the @xmath62-order residual , can be used to obtain the @xmath65-order term .",
    "thus , each decomposition term results in an image in which objects of the corresponding scale are dominant , while the residuals contain information for smaller dimension scales .    the decay signal is searched for by averaging the luminosity of the images over  rings \" centered on the position of the center of the sun . as the wavelet analysis requires a dyadic dimension of the field (",
    "the number of pixels on each border of the image is a power of 2 ) , there is no  central pixel \" ; so we have considered each of the four pixels adjacent to the image center as  central \" and then averaged the obtained luminosity profiles .",
    "2 shows the luminosity profiles obtained from the total images a ( fig .",
    "2a ) and b ( fig .",
    "both graphs refer to the  white \" channels , that is the sum over the three color channels .",
    "the vertical scales are expressed in adu ; the meaning of 1 adu ( different for each instrument ) is discussed in section 4 .",
    "the difference between the two total images is due to the different ccd sensitivities , spatial resolution and optical feathures of the instruments .",
    "data set a presents no clear structure , data b might contain some at relatively large @xmath66 .",
    "most of the background is removed by the wavelet decomposition .",
    "3 shows the residuals of order 5 for the data a , and of order 8 for the b data , in the  white \" channel . in these residuals",
    "( the highest possible order for each data sets ) , the contributions of structures larger than @xmath67 pixels@xmath31 are removed .    both figs .",
    "3a and 3b are dominated by fluctuations , so we may conclude that at our experimental sensitivities , data sets a and b do not contain indication for a narrow light excess from the direction of the center of the sun .",
    "the increase of the fluctuation amplitudes near the limits of the angular range , clearly noticeable in fig .",
    "3b , is natural , as the number of pixels that contribute to the average luminosity in that regions is smaller than in the rest of the image .",
    "we recall that maxima confined to the first bin and present in all color channels were observed in the tse 1999 data @xcite .",
    "probably we observed the so - called  poisson spot \" consisting in a peculiar diffraction phenomenon that is produced when a circular opaque object , with size much smaller than the distance to a screen , but much larger than the light wavelength , is illuminated by a parallel beam @xcite . in such conditions , a point - like spot of light could be observed on the screen , in the middle of the shadow of the object . in 1999",
    "we analyzed a video filmed close to the point of maximum eclipse , when the center of the sun , the center of the moon and the observer were in very good alignment .",
    "since in 2001 we were in a location 8 km away from the line of centrality of the tse , one dos not expect that the same effect is seen .",
    "such signal could be enhanced by aligning the 10 pictures with respect to the center of the moon .",
    "4 shows the results of such an analysis .    in figs . 4a and 4b there is no peak associated with the center of the moon disk .",
    "a darker spot is instead seen in the center of the moon ; it should correspond to the dark schrter area .",
    "the structures in fig 4a may be produced by the image of the moon surface in the light of the sun reflected by the earth .",
    "their absence in fig .",
    "4b is due to the rejection of large structures by the wavelet decomposition .",
    "the expected signal from a decay ( 1 ) , considering its mc estimated width @xcite , should be better seen in the fourth order wavelet term of data sets a and b , as it corresponds to structures with about 40 `` - 60 '' width .",
    "5 shows the luminosity distributions for this term .",
    "note that each bin is an average over @xmath68 pixels in the case of data set a ( fig .",
    "5a ) , and over @xmath69 pixels for set b ( fig .",
    "no central maximum is present in both data sets , and we can use these wavelet terms to determine lower lifetime limits for the investigated decay .    the search for the @xmath60 decay is more difficult , as the expected signal is broader ( about 200 `` - 300 '' ) @xcite . since the wavelet decomposition could remove broad signals , we searched for the corresponding signal in the raw data .",
    "data set a does not exhibit such a signal ( fig .",
    "2a ) , but the luminosity curve obtained from set b ( fig .",
    "2b ) could suggest the presence of the expected signal . considering the good resolution and sensitivity of instrument",
    "b , we assumed that the ashen light ( the luminosity of the moon surface due to the light of the sun reflected by the earth ) could be responsible for most of the signal seen in b. in order to verify that , we performed the same analysis on an image of the full moon , obtained with the same telescope and camera .",
    "the results of this test are shown in figs .",
    "6a and 6b .    the structures in fig .",
    "6a are similar to those in figs .",
    "2b and 4a ; we should take into consideration that the earth reflects the light of the sun as a convex mirror , thus the central part of the moon receives more light from the earth than the rest of it .",
    "instead the sun iluminates the moon uniformely .",
    "this observation suggests that we can not simply remove the image of the full moon from the data , as it would create a fake signal in the central part of the resulting image .",
    "thus , one should develop a reliable model of the ashen light ; alternatively one should use the wavelet decomposition . note that the exposure conditions for the image of the full moon were different than those during the eclipse ,",
    "so the adu values are not directly comparable . as we can not determine which is the real contribution of the ashen light in set b , we can use the results only to determine a lower limit for the @xmath2 lifetime .",
    "the luminosity values given in the previous sections in adu have to be converted in numbers of photons hitting each pixel of the ccd s of our detectors . for this purpose",
    "two sets of calibrations were made , using the monochromators of the catania and bologna astronomical observatories .",
    "the obtained calibration curves are consistent one with the other .",
    "we took care to calibrate the instruments in conditions as close as possible to the conditions in which the tse data were recorded .",
    "the digital videocamera was operated in the same conditions as during the eclipse ; the pictures with the digital camera were taken with exposures of 2 s , and a fixed diaphragm aperture ( f/2.5 ) . as mentioned in section 2 , the 10 digital pictures in data set b were obtained with different apertures ; the total 20 s of exposure in the eclipse conditions is equivalent to about 4.7 s in the calibration conditions .",
    "7 shows the calibration curves obtained . in the vertical scales",
    "are indicated the number of incident photons that produce 1 adu in one pixel of the ccd s .",
    "each curve corresponds to one color channel .    from these calibrations",
    "it follows that the wavelength averaged number of visible photons that produces one adu in the  white \" channel of data set a is about @xmath70 , while for data set b is two orders of magnitude smaller : @xmath71 .",
    "this could explain why we may see the ashen light only in data b.",
    "both data a and b were processed in order to search for signals produced by a possible radiative decay of the heavier component of solar neutrinos . in the absence of a valid signal",
    ", we used the two sets to obtain lower limits for the neutrino radiative decay lifetime .",
    "let us assume the simplest scenario in which the sun electron neutrinos are a superposition of only two mass eigenstates @xmath8 , @xmath1 , with a mixing angle @xmath72 @xmath73 using the calibrations of our instruments , we transform the adu into numbers of photons @xmath74 , that produced the analyzed images .",
    "the lifetimes of the @xmath57 decay in the laboratory frame of reference , can be calculated from the standard deviations of the fourth order terms of the wavelet decomposition of our data @xmath75 where @xmath76 are the mass - dependent probabilities estimated by the mc simulation @xcite , @xmath77 , ( @xmath78 is the flux of solar neutrinos at the earth ( or moon ) and @xmath72 the mixing angle ) is the local flux of solar @xmath1 mass eigenstate neutrinos , @xmath79 is the area of the moon surface covered by the analysis ( the area of the square on the moon that is visualized inside the dyadic square ) and @xmath80 is the time of observation .",
    "@xmath81 is the average time spent by solar neutrinos inside the observation cone ( about one third of the flight time from the moon to the earth ) , and @xmath82 is the time of flight of the neutrinos from the sun to the moon @xcite .",
    "the mc probabilities @xmath76 are shown in figs .",
    "8a , b , for data sets a and b , respectively . assuming that a neutrino decay occurs during the flight of solar neutrinos between the moon and the earth , inside the region of space  visible \" by the experiment , and that the emitted photon reaches the detector , the probability @xmath76 includes kinematic effects ( dominated by the assumed polarization @xmath83 of the @xmath1 beam ) , the request that the emitted photon should be in the visible energy range and the  imprints \" of the initial neutrino characteristics ( energy and  birth \" position ) , according to the ssm @xcite .",
    "the simulations were made for three possible values of the polarization of the decaying neutrinos : @xmath84 , which corresponds to dirac left - handed neutrinos ( like for the massless neutrinos in the standard model ) , @xmath85 ( majorana neutrinos ) , and for right handed dirac neutrinos ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "similar simulations where made assuming @xmath87 , with @xmath88 ev@xmath31 .",

    "the limit obtained by the first tse experiment @xcite is indicated by the horizontal arrow ; note that this limit , obtained using different physical hypotheses , is valid for neutrino masses of few ev .",
    "neutrino lifetime values larger than our lower limits are not in conflict with the oscillation explanation of the solar neutrino deficit .",
    "the neutrino time of flight from the sun to the earth is about 500 s ( in the laboratory frame of reference ) .",
