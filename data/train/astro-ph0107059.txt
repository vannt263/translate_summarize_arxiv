    "narrow - line seyfert 1 ( nls1 ) galaxies were first classified on the basis of their narrow permitted optical emission lines , with full - width - half - maximum ( fwhm ) 2000(osterbrock & pogge 1985 ) .",
    "they also exhibit distinctive x - ray properties ( e.g. , puchnarewicz et al .",
    "1992 ; boller et al .  1996",
    "; brandt , mathur , & elvis 1997 ; turner 1999 ; leighly 1999a , b ) .",
    "these include a steep soft excess with photon index @xmath10 ( photon flux @xmath11 ) , a steep hard power law with @xmath12 , and rapid , short time - scale variations ( e.g. , @xmath13 30% in 1500 sec ) .",
    "their uv / optical properties place them at one extreme of the boroson & green ( 1992 ) primary eigenvector that has been identified in a principal component analysis ; specifically , nls1 classification correlates with strong optical  and weak 5007  emission .",
    "nls1s are thus potentially useful in identifying the underlying physics that defines the primary eigenvector .",
    "a number of scenarios have been posited to explain nls1 properties :    1 .",
    "nls1s may have larger broad - line region ( blr ) sizes compared to seyfert 1 ( s1 ) galaxies .",
    "the steeper soft excesses imply higher ionizing fluxes than s1 galaxies with comparable luminosities . under certain conditions",
    "this may lead to larger blr sizes and hence smaller permitted line widths , assuming they reflect virialized motions about the putative black hole ( guilbert , fabian , & mccray 1983 ; wandel & boller 1998 ) .",
    "2 .   nls1s may be low - inclination @xmath14 , nearly face - on systems ( osterbrock & pogge 1985 ) .",
    "the line widths , attributable to orbital , virialized motions in a common plane are decreased by @xmath15 , and the strong soft x - ray fluxes are reconcilable with accretion disk models ( e.g. , madau 1988 ) . however , this orientation scenario has problems explaining the low luminosities often observed ( e.g. , boroson & green 1992 ) .",
    "3 .   nls1s may have relatively low black hole masses with higher than normal accretion rates , compared to s1 galaxies ( pounds , done , & osborne 1995 ) .",
    "the smaller line widths are attributable to the reduced gravitational potential in which they form , and higher accretion rates result in luminosities that are large for their masses .",
    "balmer ( ) blr sizes and masses have been measured for about 40 agns , including five nls1s ( wandel , peterson , & malkan 1999 ; kaspi et al.2000 ; peterson et al .",
    "2000 ; shemmer et al .",
    "these results suggest that nls1s have blr sizes comparable to those of s1s with similar optical luminosities .",
    "moreover , nls1 and s1 galaxies delineate a broad mass - luminosity relationship with the former sources populating the low mass extremum of this relationship .",
    "this is consistent with the hypothesis that nls1s are undermassive black hole systems with higher accretion rates and/or sources viewed nearly face - on .    to distinguish between various models requires systematic measurements of the black hole masses @xmath16 , mass accretion rates @xmath17 , broad - line region sizes @xmath18 , and source inclinations @xmath14 of nls1s and other s1s .",
    "these key parameters may all be measured directly or inferred through application of echo mapping ( reverberation ) techniques ( blandford & mckee 1982 ; peterson 2001 ) that use the relative responses of continuum and emission - line components to constrain strongly the nature of the responding emission regions .",
    "the responsivity - weighted blr size is given approximately by @xmath19 , with @xmath20 the time lag , measured from cross - correlation analysis , between the continuum and delayed , radiatively driven emission - line variations . combining @xmath21 with",
    "the emission - line velocity full - width - half - maximum @xmath22 , assumed to be gravitationally determined and derived from the variable line profile , virial masses @xmath16 follow from @xmath23 , with @xmath24 a factor of order unity that depends on the detailed emission - line gas distribution ( and which may be determined by measuring the velocity - dependent emission - line response ) .",

    "( 2000 ) , and peterson et al .",
    "( 2000 ) are based on these reverberation techniques . the magnitude and wavelength - dependence of any continuum time delays , when combined with the spectral energy distribution , may be used to constrain the product @xmath25 under certain conditions ( collier et al .",

    "the width of the continuum delay distribution at many wavelengths and the velocity dependent emission - line response ( e.g. , welsh & horne 1991 ) may be used to measure the source inclination .",
    "these methods for measuring @xmath17 and @xmath14 have not been applied with much success to existing datasets , since they lack sufficient signal - to - noise and monitoring duration .",

    "these observations were primarily intended to measure the effective size of the uv blr of a nls1 , and permit measurement of a virial mass @xmath16 based on multiple emission lines , and thereby further constrain the nature of nls1 galaxies .",

    "we observed the nucleus of akn  564 with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) on the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) on 46 occasions during the period 2000 may  9 to july  8 .",
    "the first five visits were separated by intervals of @xmath13 5 days .",
    "beginning on the fifth visit ( 2000 may  29 ) , the sampling interval was decreased to @xmath13 1 day for the remaining monitoring period .",
    "we obtained low - resolution spectra during each visit with the g140l and g230l gratings , thereby providing full uv coverage at a spectral resolution of approximately 1.2  over the range 11501730  and 3.2  over the range 15703150 .",
    "we used the @xmath31 slit for the low - resolution spectra to maximize throughput and ensure accurate absolute photometry .",
    "as akn  564 is a point source in the stis spectral images , there was no significant resolution degradation by using the wide slit .",
    "the exposure times were 1200 and 520 seconds for each g140l and g230l spectrum , respectively , except on 2000 may  29 , when the respective exposure times were 1434 and 816 seconds . to estimate the effects of the intrinsic absorption on the uv emission - line profiles",
    ", we obtained high - resolution echelle spectra of the nucleus on 2000 may  29 with the e140 m grating at a spectral resolving power of @xmath32 .",
    "the e140 m spectra were obtained through the @xmath33 aperture during four consecutive orbits to yield a combined exposure time of 10,310 sec .",
    "the spectra were reduced using the idl software developed at nasa s goddard space flight center for the stis instrument definition team ( lindler 1998 ) . for the low - dispersion spectra , we used standard point - source processing with an extraction height ( perpendicular to the dispersion ) of @xmath34 to obtain flux - calibrated g140l and g230l spectra as a function of wavelength .",
    "small wavelength calibration uncertainties exist between spectra of a given grating . to remove these effects , relative wavelength calibration of spectra for each grating",
    "is required .",
    "the methodology we employ is analogous to that described by korista et al .",
    "( 1995 ) ( except we do not subtract a continuum fit from each spectrum ) .",
    "we cross - correlate the spectra near the emission - line peaks of @xmath3 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 for the g140l grating , and near the peaks of ] @xmath35 and @xmath36 for the g230l grating .",
    "hence , we determine the nearest whole pixel shifts for each spectrum relative to its appropriate mean spectrum .",
    "the majority of the spectra ( about 90% ) required either a one or zero - pixel shift , and the remaining spectra required a two - pixel shift .",
    "the uncertainty in our relative wavelength calibration is of order @xmath37 pixels , i.e. , about 0.6  and 1.7  for the g140l and g230l gratings , respectively .",
    "we made no attempt to intercalibrate the g140l and g230l spectra , given their difference in resolution .",
    "the observed mean and root mean square ( rms ) of the 46 g140l and g230l spectra are presented in figures 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "the rms spectra have been corrected for the bias due to measurement errors .",
    "furthermore , these spectra have been corrected for galactic reddening using @xmath38 mag .",
    "( schlegel et al .  1998 ) .",
    "we note narrow line balmer decrement and @xmath6/@xmath39 ratios suggest internal reddening is potentially large for akn  564 ( walter & fink 1993 ; paper iii ) , i.e. , @xmath40mag .",
    "determination of the internal reddening in akn  564 will be discussed in a forthcoming paper , crenshaw et al .",
    "the mean spectra are rich in both emission and absorption features .",
    "the prominent emission features have been identified and labelled in figs .  1 and 2 .",
    "many of the unlabelled , poorer contrast features may be associated with  emission .",
    "intrinsic uv absorption in @xmath3 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath5 is present , along with galactic absorption in lines such as @xmath42 and @xmath36 ( crenshaw et al .",
    "we have made no attempt to identify the complex of absorption features shortward of @xmath3 , since this spectral region is affected by time - dependent residuals due to imperfect subtraction of geocoronal  emission .",
    "we defer discussion of the rms spectra to  5 .    in order to quantify the prominent emission - line characteristics",
    ", we determine pure emission - line spectra from which appropriate mean spectral measurements are then made .",
    "this was done through cubic spline interpolations over the absorption features and subtraction of a power - law fit to the continuum . our spectral measurements ( to be discussed in this section ) assume zero internal reddening .",
    "the continuum is defined by four nominally line - free bands chosen by visual inspection of the mean spectrum , fig . 1 ; 11551180 , 13501380 , 14601500 , and 16201660 .",
    "these bands only approximate the true continuum level , since balmer recombination continuum ,  blends and other weak broad emission contaminate them to some extent .",
    "the rms spectrum , fig .  1 , indicates these bands are not notably biased by line variability .",
    "the best - fit continuum is described by @xmath43 with @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the continuum fit uncertainties are purely statistical and should be treated with caution , since systematic errors due to reddening , for example , are non - negligible .",
    "this uv continuum is redder than @xmath46 , typically observed in quasars ( obrien et al .",
    "this may be due to , for example , disk irradiation ( assuming the uv emission arises in an accretion disk ) and/or internal reddening . we choose to extrapolate this continuum into the g230l spectral range , since here the continuum level is poorly defined , as the aforementioned contaminants strengthen .",
    "we note , in this regime , the extrapolated continuum is about 30% below the local , pseudo - continuum defined largely by the fe ii blends .",
    "the validity of the above continuum fit awaits detailed consideration of these fe ii blends and corrections for internal reddening .",

    "we note that all values in table 1 are in the observed frame .",
    "we chose to measure line fluxes at 20% maximum intensity to minimize the effects of line blending , by measuring the primary emission line flux only .",
    "the uncertainties in the full width and flux measurements ( table 1 ) are dominated by systematic errors attributable to uncertainties in the applied absorption ( where applicable ) and reddening corrections .",
    "we assess the uncertainty associated with our absorption corrections by using cubic spline and linear interpolations over the @xmath3 absorption feature .",
    "figure 3 presents an illustrative example of the ambiguity in the @xmath3 emission line profile due to the different interpolation schemes .",
    "we find uncertainties of @xmath13 15% and 8% for our line width and flux measurements , respectively .",
    "we do not consider the systematic uncertainty in our applied reddening corrections , given the aforementioned possibility of large internal reddening . for wavelengths 1800 , systematic errors of @xmath51 due to uncertainties in our continuum fit",
    "may be important , but are not considered further .",

    "these results support the negligible presence of emission - line variability to be discussed in  5 .",
    "we note the dip in the maximum correlation coefficient at about 1700is due to calibration uncertainties in the g230l spectra .",

    "our attempts at validating and possibly improving our direct integration light curves through spectral fitting with the iraf task specfit ( kriss 1994 ) failed .",
    "this was because the spectral complexity of the emission - line profiles permitted too much freedom in the fitting process such that artifical emission - line variations were introduced by corresponding changes in the adopted absorption profile .",

    "the blr of akn  564 is characterised by smaller gas velocity dispersions ( as determined by the emission - line velocity full - width - half - maximum ) than found in typical s1 galaxies (  3 ) , as noted earlier by rodrguez - pascual et al .",

    "our results suggest an absence of outflowing high ionization blr gas with velocities 230 kms@xmath55 in akn  564 .",
    "moreover , the approximate symmetry of the emission - line profiles may indicate the predominance of optically thin broad line emission , since it is emitted essentially isotropically and traces the full velocity field ( netzer 1976 ; davidson 1977 ; shields , ferland , & peterson 1995 ) .",

    "<S> we present results of an intensive two - month campaign of approximately daily spectrophotometric monitoring of the narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxy akn  564 with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) . </S>",
    "<S> the fractional variability amplitude of the continuum variations between 13653000is @xmath0% , about a factor 3 less than that found in typical seyfert 1 galaxies over a similar period of time . however , large amplitude , short time - scale flaring behavior is evident , with trough - to - peak flux changes of about 18% in approximately 3 days . </S>",
    "<S> we present evidence for wavelength - dependent continuum time delays , with the variations at 3000  lagging behind those at 1365  by about 1 day . </S>",
    "<S> these delays may be interpreted as evidence for a stratified continuum reprocessing region , possibly an accretion - disk structure . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 emission - line exhibits flux variations of about 1% amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> these variations lag those at 1365  by 3 days , and combining this with the line width yields a virial black - hole mass limit of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we caution , the low amplitude @xmath3 variations may indicate the bulk of the emission region is at larger radii . </S>",
    "<S> this scenario affects the veracity of our black hole mass upper limit in an uncertain manner due to the unknown nature of the gas velocity field . </S>",
    "<S> our mass estimate is thus unreliable , however , it is consistent with the independent estimate @xmath4 of pounds et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2001 ) , based on a fluctuation power spectrum analysis of x - ray variability in akn 564 . the black - hole mass and 5100  luminosity of akn  564 are consistent with the hypothesis that , relative to seyfert 1 galaxies , nls1s have lower black hole masses and higher accretion rates . </S>",
    "<S> other strong emission lines , e.g. , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , are constrained to vary with amplitudes of @xmath7 5% . </S>",
    "<S> this low - level of emission - line variability is different from most seyfert 1 galaxies , which characteristically display variations of @xmath8% on similar time scales .    </S>"
