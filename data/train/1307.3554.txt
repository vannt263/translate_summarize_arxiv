    "the major expected source of gravitational waves for the advanced ligo @xcite class of gravitational wave detectors are compact binary systems .",
    "the long inspiral signals from such binaries will be detected by matched filtering with theoretical templates , which allows signal - to - noise to be built up over many orbits @xcite .",
    "gravitational waves ( gws ) are also emitted as broad band bursts when compact objects undergo close passages , either during single parabolic or hyperbolic encounters , or during repeated eccentric encounters @xcite .",
    "such events occur rarely , but are more likely in dense stellar environments , such as globular clusters or galactic nuclear clusters .",
    "the brief duration of such bursts do not allow a large integrated buildup of signal to noise , and they may be difficult to detect without some electromagnetic trigger .",
    "recently , @xcite showed that during binary inspiral of neutron stars ( nss ) resonant tidal excitation of the interface mode  a natural mode of a neutron star peaked at the crust - core boundary  could result in an isotropic resonant shattering flare , and that these were consistent with short gamma - ray burst ( sgrb ) precursors observed seconds before some sgrbs @xcite .",
    "coincident timing of such precursor flares and the gw inspiral signal can be used to provide strong constraints on the ns equation of state @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we show that resonant shattering flares can also occur during close passages with other compact objects , such as another ns or a black hole ( bh ) , and that such flares could serve as electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational wave bursts , allowing triggered searches for these bursts .",
    "tidal energy transfer during close encounters can be determined in a newtonian approximation through the procedure outlined in @xcite .",
    "while a fully relativistic formulation would be preferable , the newtonian formulation is sufficiently accurate for periapse distance much larger than the neutron star radius , relativistic effects would only slightly modify the frequencies and increase the strength of the interaction .",
    "in general the energy transfer rate to a star is given by = d^3 x u where the fluid velocity @xmath0 is the time derivative of the lagrangian displacement @xmath1 and @xmath2 is the gravitational potential . to examine the response of a neutron star with mass @xmath3 it is convenient to decompose the potential due to a star with mass @xmath4 into spherical harmonics @xmath5 , u(r , , ) = _ l=0^ _ m =- l^l u_lm y_lm^ * ( , ) + u_lm = w_lm e^im(t ) where @xmath6 is the true anomaly of the system , @xmath7 denotes the complex conjugate , @xmath8 is the distance between the stars , and @xmath9 is the co - moving coordinate system centered with @xmath3 .",

    "the energy transferred to a particular mode ( assuming no non - linear effects , such as crust fracture ) during a periapse passage for a parabolic or highly eccentric encounter can be estimated by eq ( 40 ) of @xcite e_nlm = 2 ^ 2 ( ) ^2 ( ) ^2l + 2 |q_nl|^2 |k_nlm|^2 where @xmath14 is the overlap integral for the ns displacement eigenmode @xmath15 , with radial mode number @xmath16 , q_nl d^3 x   _ nlm^ * [ r^2 y_l , m ( , ) ] , [ eq : q ] and k_nlm = 2 ^ 3/2 i_lm(_nlm ) i_lm(_nlm ) _ 0^(1 + x^2)^-ldx .",

    "similar interactions could potentially drive close encounters of nss or bhs in triple systems , however , the periapse for shattering flares is two orders of magnitude smaller than those considered by @xcite , and nss and bhs are substantially more rare than white dwarfs , particularly outside of dense clusters . within clusters",

    "highly eccentric captures of nss in dense stellar environments are expected to result in repeated gw bursts @xcite , but may also lead to repeated shattering flares at each periapse passage .",
    "we have also reviewed and updated the rates for compact object encounters presented in the literature for dense stellar environments , and find that these rates should be revised significantly downwards . while these estimated rates for close encounters involving neutron stars within the horizon of advanced ligo are low , shattering flares during from such encounters can be detected significantly farther , and may occur at a rates of up to @xmath80 yr@xmath59 gpc@xmath60 , subject to large model uncertainties .",

    "we begin by following the general procedure outlined in the appendix c of @xcite , and calculate the eccentric capture rate for a single fiducial galaxy .",

    "there is large uncertainty in the ns production rate in nuclear star clusters , mostly due to two factors .",
    "first , the imf is unknown and could range from the standard salpeter imf , to an extremely top - heavy imf ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "second , there is great uncertainty in the effects of mass - loss for deteriming the fraction of stars with @xmath152 that will become neutron stars , and the fraction that will collapse to form black holes ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * for discussion ) .    with these considerations",
    ", we will assume that between @xmath63 of the stars in a nuclear star cluster will become neutron stars .",
    "the low end of this range is for a standard imf , with low mass loss and metallicity , while the high end roughly corresponds to a top - heavy imf with more mass loss in the ns progenitors . assuming an average stellar mass in nuclear star clusters of @xmath153 , this gives @xmath154 .",
    "neutron stars have only had time to segregate in galaxies for which @xmath155 km s@xmath59 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately these low mass galaxies also have escape velocities @xmath156 , and thus ns kick velocities of @xmath157 km s@xmath59 will significantly reduce the retention fraction after ns formation , much like in globular clusters .",
    "so we will assume the scaling above with no significant enhancements due to segregation or flattening .",
    "substituting @xmath158 , @xmath159 and @xmath160 into ( [ finalrate ] ) and continuing to use the very generous assumptions above for @xmath161 and @xmath162 we get a rate for eccentric capture of ^(gn , ec)_ns - ns 0.04 - 6 yr^-1 gpc^-3 . for @xmath25",
    "bh - @xmath26 ns encounters we take @xmath163 , @xmath164 , @xmath165 , @xmath166 , and get a rate ^(gn , ec)_bh - ns 0.05 - 0.6 yr^-1 gpc^-3",
    ".    however , in systems where the bh s dominate the core , a cusp of more massive objects tends to flatten out the distribution of lighter objects , compared to an isothermal density profile .",
    "@xcite find that the distribution can approach a power law index of 1.5 for the lighter objects in their fokker - planck calculation .",
    "repeating the above calculations for @xmath167 as a lower bound , we find ^(gn , ec)_ns - ns 0.003 - 0.3 yr^-1 gpc^-3 , noting that the rate in a single galaxy is no longer dominated by the contribution due to the innermost objects .",
    "eccentric captures , described above , provide multiple close passages , however , the cross section for eccentric capture only exceeds that for shattering flares from the first passage below @xmath168 km s@xmath59 . near the center of nuclear star clusters  where the density and relative velocity dispersion are the highest  the rate for hyperbolic passages that result in shattering flares , but are not bound through gw emission can be significant . in this appendix",
    "we calculate this rate for shattering flares during first passage .",
    "we begin by assuming that that the speed at infinite separation is small compared to the speed at periapse @xmath169 .",
    "the maximum periapse distance for shattering is then only a function of the stellar masses , and the equation of state r_p , s = r_p , s ( , m_tot , eos ) , which can be determined through setting @xmath170 as in @xmath171 of the main text above .",
    "we can then calculate the single galaxy rate as for eccentric captures , giving ^(gn , sf)_gal & & _ r_min^r_i 4 r^2 ( ) ^-4 dr + & & 1.3 10 ^ -10 yr^-1 ( ) ( ) ^5/2 ( ) ^5/2 _ 0.25 ^",

    "similar to the case for eccentric captures , less generous estimates for the intrinsic scatter significantly reduce these rates .",
