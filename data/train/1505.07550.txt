    "a ring of n@xmath0h@xmath1 emission was found in the disk around tw hya using alma ( atacama large millimeter and submillimeter array ) @xcite .",
    "n@xmath0h@xmath1 is considered to be a useful probe of co snow line , because it is destroyed by the proton transfer to co @xmath2 the inner radius of n@xmath0h@xmath1 ring is indeed consistent with the co snow line predicted from a disk model of tw hya .",
    "the anti - correlation of n@xmath0h@xmath1 and co emission is also often observed in prestellar cores ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which strengthen the above statement .",
    "the bright emission of n@xmath0h@xmath1 outside the co snow line is , however , puzzling .",
    "laboratory experiments show that the sublimation temperatures of co and n@xmath0 are similar @xcite .",
    "since n@xmath0h@xmath1 is formed by protonation of n@xmath0 , n@xmath0h@xmath1 should also be depleted outside the co snow line . in the case of prestellar cores ,",
    "there are two possible explanations for the survival of n@xmath0h@xmath1 in the co depleted region .",
    "firstly , destruction of n@xmath0h@xmath1 is temporally suppressed by the freeze - out of its major reactant , co. secondly , the slow formation of n@xmath0 from n atom in molecular clouds helps the temporal survival of n@xmath0 @xcite . the first mechanism could work in the disk as well , in a narrow range of temperatures where the positive effect of depletion on n@xmath0h@xmath1 abundance ( i.e. decrease of co ) wins against the negative effect ( i.e. depletion of n@xmath0 ) .",
    "the second mechanism , on the other hand , seems irrelevant for disks . in protoplanetary disks ,",
    "in which the gas density is much higher than molecular clouds , it is not likely that n atom is more abundant than n@xmath0 except for the photodissociation layer at disk surface .    in chemistry models of disks",
    ", it is often found that co is depleted even in regions warmer than its sublimation temperature ( @xmath3 k ) via conversion to less volatile species @xcite . since the conversion works as a sink in the chemical reaction network of gaseous species , we call it the sink effect in the present work .",
    "@xcite showed , for the first time , observational evidences for such co depletion towards tw hya .",
    "@xcite showed that n@xmath0 is also subject to the sink effect ; it is converted to nh@xmath4 via the gas - phase reactions of @xmath5 and subsequent hydrogenations of nh on grain surfaces .",
    "it should be noted that this conversion is not efficient when co is abundant , because n@xmath0h@xmath1 mainly reacts with co to reform n@xmath0 .",
    "the longer timescale required for n@xmath0 depletion could explain the n@xmath0h@xmath1 ring .",
    "but then the lifetime of the ring should be similar to the difference in the depletion timescales of co and n@xmath0 , which is rather short @xmath6 yr , if the ionization rate is @xmath7 s@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "since n@xmath0 is considered to be a major nitrogen carrier in protoplanetary disks , but can not be directly observed , it is important to constrain its distribution based on n@xmath0h@xmath1 observation .",
    "the formation mechanism of n@xmath0h@xmath1 ring is thus worth investigation via theoretical calculations .",
    "the abundance of n@xmath0h@xmath1 could also be a probe of ionization degree in the regions of co depletion .",
    "the ionization degree depends on the gas density and ionization rate , which is an important parameter for both chemical and physical evolutions of the disk .",
    "since ionizations trigger the chemical reactions , as in molecular clouds , the timescale of chemical evolution depends on the ionization rate @xcite .",
    "the ionization degree determines the coupling with magnetic fields , e.g. which disk region is subject to magneto - rotational instability @xcite .",
    "the major ionization sources are x - ray from the central star , cosmic ray , and decay of radioactive nuclei @xcite .",
    "the ionization rate thus depends on the flux and hardness of x - ray radiation and the abundances of radioactive nuclei .",
    "in addition , the stellar winds and/or magnetic fields of the star - disk system could prevent the penetration of the cosmic ray to the disk . since these parameters are unknown and could vary among objects , the ionization degree should be probed via observations .",
    "the observation of ionization degree is principally possible using major ion molecules .",
    "but a quantitative estimate of the ionization degree from the observational data is not straightforward , because the gas density , major ion molecules , and their abundances change spatially within the disk ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this work",
    ", we investigate the spatial distribution of n@xmath0h@xmath1 and other major molecular ions in protoplanetary disks .",
    "firstly , we calculate the full chemical network model , which includes gas - phase and grain - surface reactions .",
    "the radial distribution of n@xmath0h@xmath1 column density has a peak around the radius of co sublimation temperature ; i.e. the n@xmath0h@xmath1 ring is reproduced .",
    "we found that the sink effect on co significantly affects the distribution of n@xmath0h@xmath1 . by analyzing the full chemical network",
    ", we also found that the abundances of major molecular ions , h@xmath9 , hco@xmath1 and n@xmath0h@xmath1 can be described by analytical functions of gas density , temperature , ionization rate , and abundances of co and n@xmath0 .",
    "such formulas are useful in deriving the ionization degree from the observations of molecular ions , combined with the dust continuum and co observations to constrain the gas density and co abundance .    while the sink effect plays an important role in determining the n@xmath0h@xmath1 distribution in the full network model , the efficiency of the sink depends on various parameters which are not well constrained yet .",
    "for example , the conversion timescale of co and n@xmath0 to less volatile species depends on ionization rate and activation barriers of the reactions",
    ". the sink effect could be less significant , if the disk is turbulent and the diffusion timescale is shorter than the conversion timescale .",
    "since there are various chemical paths for the conversion , it is difficult to directly control the efficiency of sink in the full - network model . in order to investigate the abundances of n@xmath0h@xmath1 and other molecular ions in the limit of no sink , we construct `` no - sink '' model",
    "; we assume that the total ( gas and ice ) abundances of co and n@xmath0 are constant , and that their gas - phase abundances are given by the balance between adsorption and desorption .",
    "the abundances of molecular ions are calculated using the analytical formulas .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in  2 , we describe our disk model and chemical model .",
    "the molecular distributions in the full - network model are presented in section  3 . in  4 , we derive analytical formulas for abundances of electron , h@xmath9 , hco@xmath1 and n@xmath0h@xmath1 .",
    "the formulas are used to calculate their abundances in the disk model , which are compared with the results of full - network calculation .",
    "section 5 presents the results of no - sink model .",
    "since the no - sink model is analytical , we can easily investigate the dependence of n@xmath0h@xmath1 column density on desorption rate ( i.e. sublimation temperature ) of co and n@xmath0 .",
    "we also investigate how much the n@xmath0h@xmath1 column density is reduced , if the penetration of cosmic rays to the disk is hampered by the stellar wind and/or magnetic fields .",
    "we summarize our results and conclusions in  6 .",
    "we adopt the same disk model as in @xcite .",
    "in addition to the disk model with small grains , which is assumed in @xcite , we also investigate a disk model in which the dust grains have grown up to a radius of 1 mm .",
    "the turbulent mixing is not explicitly included in the present work .",
    "the model of full chemical network is also the same as in @xcite , but includes some updates .",
    "the models are briefly described in the following .",
    "since we aim to understand the mechanism to form n@xmath0h@xmath1 ring , rather than to investigate the disk structure of a specific object ( i.e. tw hya ) , we adopt a steady , axisymmetric keplerian disk around a t tauri star .",
    "the stellar mass , radius and effective temperature are @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 k , respectively . the disk structure",
    "is given by solving the radiation transfer , thermal balance of gas and dust , and hydrostatic equilibrium in the vertical direction in the disk .",
    "basic equations and calculation procedures are described in @xcite .",
    "we assume the stellar uv and x - ray luminosity of @xmath13 erg s@xmath8 and @xmath14 erg s@xmath8 , respectively .",
    "the cosmic ray ionization rate of h@xmath0 is set to be @xmath15 s@xmath8 @xcite , while the ionization rate by the decay of radioactive nuclei is set to be @xmath16 s@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the dust - to - gas mass ratio is 0.01 .",
    "we consider two disk models : one with the dark cloud dust and the other with millimeter - sized grains @xcite .",
    "the former assumes the dust properties of @xcite ( @xmath17 , case b ) ; while the silicate grains have a rather steep size distribution with the maximum radius of @xmath18 @xmath19 m , the carbonaceous grains have pah - like properties in the small - size limit and graphite - like properties at larger sizes .",
    "the maximum size of carbonaceous grain is @xmath20 @xmath19 m . in the latter model , we assume the power - law size distribution of dust grains @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the grain radius , referring to the ism dust model of @xcite , but the minimum and maximum sizes are set to be 0.01 @xmath19 m and 1 mm , respectively",
    ". it would be more appropriate for t tauri disks than the dark cloud dust model , since the grain growth is indicated by the disk observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the dust opacities for the two models are calculated using mie theory .",
    "the gas temperature , dust temperature , and density distributions in the disk are calculated self - consistently , by considering various heating and cooling mechanisms .",
    "figure [ disk_model ] shows the distribution of gas density , gas temperature , dust temperature , and ionization rate by x - ray in our models .",
    "cosmic ray ionization dominates in the midplane where the x - ray ionization rate is @xmath23 s@xmath8 .",
    "the temperature in the model with millimeter grains is lower than that in the dark cloud dust model due to the lower dust opacity at a given disk height ( @xmath24 ) to receive the radiation from the central star .",
    "column density in these disk models are determined by assuming a steady state disk structure with constant viscosity and accretion rate ( although we consider turbulent diffusion and/or radial accretion only implicitly in the chemical model ) , so that the masses of the two disks are slightly different : @xmath25 for the dark cloud dust model and @xmath26 for the millimeter grain model .",
    "our chemical network is based on @xcite .",
    "we added photo - ionization , photo - dissociation and photo - desorption by uv radiation from the central star , self - shielding of h@xmath0 , co and n@xmath0 @xcite , x - ray chemistry and charge balance of dust grains .",
    "although our model includes deuteration and ortho / para states of several species such as h@xmath0 and h@xmath9 ( hincelin et al . in prep , furuya et al . in prep ) , we present only the molecular abundances , i.e. the sum of isotopomers and o / p states .",
    "the d / h ratio and o / p ratios will be presented in forthcoming papers .",
    "our model consists of two phases , gas phase and ice mantle ; i.e. we do not discriminate layers of ice mantles , unless otherwise stated .",
    "desorption energies ( @xmath27 ) of assorted species are listed in table 1 in @xcite .",
    "desorption energies of atomic hydrogen , co and",
    "n@xmath0 are set to be 600 k , 1150 k , and 1000 k , respectively ; they are the values on water ice substrates @xcite .",
    "the sublimation temperature of co and n@xmath0 are then @xmath28 k and @xmath29 k , when the gas density is @xmath30 @xmath31 .",
    "we investigate the dependence of n@xmath0h@xmath1 abundance on the desorption energies of co and n@xmath0 in  3 and  5 .",
    "adsorbed species on grains migrate via thermal hopping and react with each other when they meet .",
    "we adopt the modified rate of @xcite for grain surface reactions of h atom .",
    "the adsorption rate of gaseous species onto grain surfaces and grain surface reaction rates ( e.g. if the rate is limited by the accretion of gaseous particle ) depend on the size distribution of grains .",
    "ideally , the grain size distribution should be taken into account @xcite .",
    "most chemical models of disks and molecular clouds , however , assume a single size of 0.1 @xmath19 m , for simplicity , which we follow in the present work .",
    "the rate coefficients of gas - dust interactions ( e.g. adsorption ) are basically proportional to the total grain surface area .",
    "the assumption of a single grain size in the chemical model is thus a reasonable approximation , as long as the total surface area of grains are consistent with that in the physical disk model .",
    "the total surface area of the 0.1 @xmath19 m dust model agrees with that of our dark cloud dust model within a factor of a few . in the chemical model for the disk model with millimeter grains , we adopt the same uniform grain size ( 0.1 @xmath19 m ) , but decrease the dust - gas ratio by one order of magnitude ; according to the power - law size distribution , the number of small grains , which dominate in the grain surface area , is decreased compared with the dark cloud dust model by an order of magnitude .",
    "one caveat for this single - size approximation is that we may underestimate the rate of grain surface recombination . in the dense regions , such as disk midplane at small radii",
    ", recombinations are more efficient on grain surfaces than in the gas phase . due to the coulomb focusing",
    ", the cross section of grain - surface recombination is much larger than the geometrical cross section of dust grains .",
    "the rate of grain surface recombination thus can not be scaled by the total grain surface area .",
    "the photodissociation rates are calculated by convolving the attenuated stellar and interstellar uv spectrum and wavelength - dependent photodissociation cross sections at each position in the disk @xcite .",
    "uv radiation induced by x - ray and cosmic ray @xcite is also taken into account . for ice mantle species , we assume that only the uppermost layers can be dissociated ; i.e. while the uv radiation can penetrate into deep layers of ice mantle , we assume that the photo products in deeper layers recombine immediately",
    ". the effective rate of photodissociation is thus reduced .",
    "considering the fluffiness and pores on the grain surfaces , we let the uppermost two layers , rather than one , to be dissociated .",
    "we take into account three non - thermal desorption processes : photodesorption , stochastic heating by cosmic - rays , and reactive desorption .",
    "we adopt the photodesorption yields per incident fuv photon derived from the laboratory experiment for h@xmath0o , co@xmath0 , co , o@xmath0 , and n@xmath0 @xcite . a yield is set to @xmath32 for other species .",
    "initial molecular abundance in the disk is given by calculating the molecular evolution in a star - forming core model of @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the initial abundances of assorted molecules and the elemental abundances in our model are listed in table [ tab_init_abun ] .",
    "major carriers of oxygen and carbon are h@xmath0o and co , while the major n - bearing species are nh@xmath4 and n@xmath0 .",
    "we adopt the low - metal abundance ; i.e. the abundances of metals such as mg and si are about two orders of magnitude lower than observed in diffuse clouds .",
    "we calculate the chemical reaction network ( i.e. rate equations ) as an initial value problem at each position in the disk .",
    "as we will see in  3 , the abundances of electron , hco@xmath1 , n@xmath0h@xmath1 , and h@xmath9 reach the steady state , which are determined by the ionization rate , gas density , temperature , and the abundances of co and n@xmath0 , in a short timescale . on the other hand",
    ", co and n@xmath0 decrease slowly with time mainly due to the sink effect . vertical diffusion and radial accretion , which are not explicitly included in the present work , could suppress or slow - down the sink effect @xcite .",
    "therefore we present molecular abundances at an early time @xmath33 yr , as well as at the typical timescale of t tauri stars @xmath34 yr .",
    "in the full - network model , we will see that the distribution of n@xmath0h@xmath1 is significantly affected by the co depletion via sink effect .",
    "efficiency of the sink effect , however , depends on various parameters such as co@xmath0 formation ( co + oh ) rate on dust grains , initial co abundance , ionization rate , and turbulent mixing @xcite .",
    "a strong vertical turbulence , for example , tends to smooth out the molecular abundances , so that the local co abundance minima due to the sink could be less significant .",
    "although the observation of tw hya indicates the co depletion via sink effect @xcite , the spatial distribution of co abundance is not well constrained yet .",
    "it is therefore useful to calculate the distribution of n@xmath0h@xmath1 in a model without the sink effect .    in the no - sink model",
    ", we assume that the sum of gas - phase and ice - mantle abundances of co is equal to its canonical abundance : i.e. @xmath35 relative to the hydrogen nuclei .",
    "the gas - phase abundance of co is given by a simple balance between adsorption and desorption ; @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are number densities of co in the gas phase and ice mantle .",
    "while the first term in the numerator represents the thermal desorption , the second term represents the non - thermal desorption .",
    "although our full network model includes various mechanisms of non - thermal desorption , here we consider only the stochastic heating by cosmic - rays for simplicity .",
    "it is the effective desorption mechanism in the cold midplane for species with relatively low desorption energies @xcite .",
    "the frequency of co oscillation on grain surface @xmath39 is set to be @xmath40 s@xmath8 . when a cosmic - ray particle hits a dust grain ,",
    "the grain is heated temporally for @xmath41 sec .",
    "the peak temperature of the temporal heating is set to be @xmath42 k. the rate for a grain to encounter fe ion particle , which is the most efficient in dust heating among cosmic - ray particles , is @xmath43 s@xmath8 .",
    "the denominator represents the sticking rate of gaseous co onto grain surfaces .",
    "the sticking probability on collision is set to be @xmath44 .",
    "the grain size @xmath22 is 0.1 @xmath19 m ( see  2.2 ) , and @xmath45 is the thermal velocity of co particle . the abundance of gaseous n@xmath0 is formulated similarly , with the total n@xmath0 abundance set to be @xmath46 .",
    "it should be noted that this desorption rate by the cosmic - ray heating is a rough estimate . in reality and in our physical disk models ,",
    "the grains actually have a size distribution , and the parameters such as @xmath47 and @xmath48 depend on the grain size .",
    "@xcite , however , showed that the desorption rate via cosmic - ray heating does not sensitively depend on the grain size as long as the grains are small @xmath49 @xmath19 m .",
    "since the small grains contribute most to the total surface area of grains , the desorption rate obtained here would be reasonable .    in section",
    " 4 , we analyze the results of full network model to find out that the abundances of electron , h@xmath9 , hco@xmath1 , and n@xmath0h@xmath1 can be well described by analytical formulas , which are the functions of density , temperature , ionization rate , and abundances of co and n@xmath0 .",

    "a combination of the analytical formulas of molecular ions and equilibrium abundances of gaseous co and n@xmath0 ( eq . [ 2phase ] and [ co_analytical ] ) makes it very easy to investigate the dependence of n@xmath0h@xmath1 abundance on various parameters such as desorption energies of co and n@xmath0 and ionization rate in the disk .",

    "n@xmath0h@xmath1 exists mostly in the upper layers of the disk .",
    "h@xmath9 is more abundant than hco@xmath1 in the disk surface due to a relatively high abundance ratio of electron to co ( see  4.4 ) .",

    "[ ism_chem ] , we can see that both co and n@xmath0 are depleted in the midplane even inside their snow lines , especially at the later stage , @xmath54 yr ; co is converted to co@xmath0 ice , ch@xmath4oh ice and hydrocarbons such as ch@xmath55 ice and c@xmath0h@xmath56 ice , while n@xmath0 is converted to nh@xmath4 ice .",
    "n@xmath0h@xmath1 is not abundant in the co depleted region , since its mother molecule , n@xmath0 , is depleted there as well . at @xmath57 yr , the sink effect is still moderate , and n@xmath0h@xmath1 abundance in the midplane has a local peak at @xmath58 au .",

    "a deeper penetration of uv radiation in the millimeter grain model is a key to suppress the sink effect on n@xmath0 .",
    "another key difference between the models with dark cloud dust and millimeter grains is that h@xmath9 is not the dominant ion in the disk surface in the latter model . since the uv shielding via dust grains is less effective in the millimeter grain model , uv radiation ionizes atoms , such as c and s , to make electrons abundant .",
    "dissociative recombination of a molecular ion with an electron is much more efficient than the radiative recombination of an atomic ion .",

    ".      electron abundance , i.e. the ionization degree , is determined by the balance between ionization and recombination .",
    "let us first assume that hco@xmath1 is the dominant ion in the disk , for simplicity .",
    "a sequence of reactions starts with ionization of h@xmath0 via cosmic - ray , x - ray , or decay of radioactive nuclei ; @xmath79 we define the ionization degree @xmath80(e ) as @xmath81(e)/@xmath82 rather than @xmath81(e)/@xmath81(h@xmath0 ) ; while the latter is the usual definition , molecular abundances are relative to hydrogen nuclei in our numerical calculation . considering the neutrality , the ionization degree in molecular gas is given by @xmath83 the ionization rate @xmath84 is a sum of the rates by cosmic ray , x - ray ( figure [ disk_model ] ) , and decay of radioactive nuclei .",
    "the rate coefficients of relevant reactions are listed in table [ tab_reactions ] in appendix a.    now , it should be noted that the dominant ion varies within the disk .",
    "although the rate coefficients of the dissociative recombination of molecular ions are mostly of the same order ( @xmath85 @xmath86 s@xmath8 ) , the values vary slightly among molecular ions .",
    "we thus adopt an iteration to evaluate the ionization degree .",
    "initially , we assume that the reaction ( [ rec_hcop ] ) dominates in the recombination of electron in the gas phase , and calculate the ionization degree , which is used to evaluate the abundances of molecular ions ( see the following subsections ) .",
    "then we re - calculate the equation ( [ electron ] ) by replacing @xmath87 with the average of the recombination rate coefficients of molecular ions weighted by their abundances .    in the midplane at @xmath88",
    "a few 10 au , the gas density is so high that the grain surface recombination becomes more effective than the gas - phase recombination ; @xmath89 where g(- ) and g(0 ) represent a negatively - charged grain and a neutral grain , respectively .",
    "then the ionization balance is described as @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the rate coefficient of the grain surface recombination of hco@xmath1 ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "it should be noted that the equation ( [ quad_e ] ) is equivalent to the equation ( [ electron ] ) , when the gas - phase recombination is more effective than the grain - surface recombination .",
    "thus we use the equation ( [ quad_e ] ) rather than ( [ electron ] ) in the calculation of ionization degree in the whole disk , and @xmath87 is replaced by the weighted mean of the recombination rate coefficients in the iteration .    in deriving the equations ( [ electron ] ) and ( [ quad_e ] ) , we have assumed that the molecular ions are the dominant charge carrier . in the disk surface",
    "however , atomic ions such as c@xmath1 and s@xmath1 are produced via photoionization and dominate over molecular ions (  3.2 ) . in the transition layer from such an atomic - ion dominated ( aid ) layer to the molecular layer , many reactions contribute to the ionization balance , and the major reactions vary over the transition layer .",

    "the gas - phase abundances of co and n@xmath0 are thus mostly determined by the thermal desorption . in the midplane at @xmath107 au ,",
    "on the other hand , the non - thermal desorption by cosmic - ray dominates over the thermal desorption .",
    "the abundance of n@xmath0h@xmath1 is determined by the equation ( [ n2hp ] ) . as expected ,",
    "n@xmath0h@xmath1 abundance is high in layers where n@xmath0 is more abundant than co. we note however , that n@xmath0h@xmath1 abundance is determined not only by the abundance ratio of n@xmath0/co . for example , in figure [ analytic_2d_con2 ] ( @xmath105 ) , the n@xmath0h@xmath1 abundance varies among the three positions where the abundances of co and n@xmath0 are equal .",

    "we can see that n@xmath0h@xmath1 column density indicates a ring structure , as in the full - network model .",
    "the spatial distribution of n@xmath0h@xmath1 is however , different from that in the full - network model .",
    "firstly , the n@xmath0h@xmath1 ring is sharp and exists right outside the co snow line in the no - sink model , simply reflecting the lower desorption energy of n@xmath0 than that of co , while it is broader in the full - network model , especially in the late stage ( @xmath118 yr ) .",
    "the peak n@xmath0h@xmath1 column density at @xmath119 au and @xmath120 yr is lower in the full network model , because n@xmath0 is depleted via the sink effect in the midplane .",
    "secondly , n@xmath0h@xmath1 is confined to a thin layer colder than the co sublimation temperature in the no - sink model , while it is abundant also in the upper warmer layers in the full - network model .",
    "the two models can thus be distinguished by constraining the vertical distributions of n@xmath0h@xmath1 from observations .    in the case of tw hya , n@xmath0h@xmath1 lines of @xmath121 and @xmath70",
    "are observed @xcite . assuming that the lines are optically thin under lte conditions , the excitation temperature is derived to be @xmath122 k. the relatively high excitation temperature of n@xmath0h@xmath1 , together with the low co abundance indicated by c@xmath123o and hd observations @xcite , might be better explained by the full - network model .",
    "we postpone the discussion on tw hya to a future work , in which we will apply our network model and analytical formulas to a disk model specified for tw hya , and simulate molecular emission with non - lte radiative transfer calculations for more quantitative comparisons with the observational data .",
    "so far , we set the desorption energies of co and n@xmath0 to be 1150 k and 1000 k , respectively .",
    "it is well known however , that the desorption energies of molecules depend on the chemical compositions and physical structure ( e.g. crystal or amorphous ) of the ice mantle . while the values we adopted from @xcite are desorption energies on water - dominated ice surfaces derived from the temperature programmed desorption ( tpd ) experiments @xcite , the desorption energies of pure ices of co and n@xmath0 are @xmath27(co)@xmath124 k and @xmath27(n@xmath125 k @xcite . in ",
    "3.2 , we have shown that in the full - network model the n@xmath0h@xmath1 distribution does not sensitively depend on the desorption energies of co and n@xmath0 , because the layer of co depletion , where n@xmath0h@xmath1 is abundant , is determined by the sink effect rather than thermal desorption . if the co sink is not effective , on the other hand , the abundance of n@xmath0h@xmath1 could be more sensitive to their desorption energies .",
    "we also note that the equation ( [ 2phase ] ) assumes the first - order desorption ; i.e. the desorption rate is proportional to the abundance of the species in the ice mantle , @xmath126 . in the following , we call this model as `` 2 phase '' , since this equation is usually used in the 2-phase gas - grain chemical models , which do not discriminate the layers of ice mantle . in reality",
    ", the migration ( and thus desorption ) of molecules deeply embedded in the ice mantle could be inefficient , at least at low temperatures ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we therefore consider another model , i.e. `` 3-phase '' model , in which only the surface monolayer is subject to desorption : @xmath127 \\bigl\\{\\nu \\exp \\bigl(-\\frac{e_{\\rm des}^{\\rm co}}{kt}\\bigr)+\\nu\\tau_{\\rm cr}c_{\\rm fe } \\exp \\bigl(-\\frac{e_{\\rm des}^{\\rm co}}{kt_{\\rm max}}\\bigr)\\bigr\\ } , \\label{eq:3phase}\\ ] ] where @xmath128 @xmath67 is the number density of adsorbing site on a grain surface .",
    "the desorption is zero - th order , as long as the ice is abundant enough to occupy more than a monolayer in the ice mantle , i.e. @xmath129 . then the gaseous abundance is independent of the total abundance . in the 2-phase model , on the other hand , the gaseous co ( n@xmath0 ) abundance is proportional to the assumed total abundance of co ( n@xmath0 ) .    before showing the n@xmath0h@xmath1 abundance in the disk model with various desorption rates ,",

    "* by analyzing the results of the full - network model , we derived analytical formulas of electron , h@xmath9 , n@xmath0h@xmath1 and hco@xmath1 abundances as functions of gas density , temperature , ionization rate , and abundances of co and n@xmath0 .",
    "the analytical formulas would be useful for radio observers to derive the abundances of these molecular ions from the observational data using a reasonable physical model for a well - observed disk such as tw hya .",
    "while the sink effect on co plays an important role in determining the n@xmath0h@xmath1 abundance in the full - network model , the efficiency of the sink depends on various parameters such as turbulence in the disk and the rates of chemical conversion of co to less volatile species .",
    "we thus constructed the no - sink model , in which the total ( gas and ice ) abundances of co and n@xmath0 are set constant , and their gas - phase abundances are determined by the balance between the adsorption and desorption .",
    "the abundances of molecular ions are calculated using the analytical formulas .",
    "the results of the no - sink models are as follows .    *",
    "the column density of n@xmath0h@xmath1 shows a ring - like structure in the no - sink model with millimeter dust grains .",
    "since the abundance of n@xmath0h@xmath1 is given by a non - linear function of co and n@xmath0 abundances , it can reach a moderate value even in the cold n@xmath0 freeze - out region , depending on the abundances of co and n@xmath0 . *   even if the desorption energies of co and n@xmath0 are the same , n@xmath0h@xmath1 abundance peaks at the temperature slightly below the co ( and n@xmath0 ) sublimation temperature , where the abundance ratio of co to electron is @xmath151 @xmath152 . * although the n@xmath0h@xmath1 ring is produced both in the full network model and in the no - sink model , the detailed distributions of n@xmath0h@xmath1 are different between the two models . in the no - sink model ,",
    "n@xmath0h@xmath1 abundant layer is confined to a layer colder than the sublimation temperature of co , while in the full - network model ( i.e. with co sink ) , n@xmath0h@xmath1 abundant layer extends to warmer layers .",
    "these models can thus be discriminated in observations if we can determine the vertical distribution of n@xmath0h@xmath1 in disks , specifically , starting with constraining the excitation temperature of n@xmath0h@xmath1 emission . *",
    "the column density of n@xmath0h@xmath1 in the no - sink model sensitively depends on the desorption rates of co and n@xmath0 . *",
    "if the cosmic ray does not reach the disk , the n@xmath0h@xmath1 column density is reduced by a factor of 20 in the model with co sink , and by a factor of 70 in the no - sink model .",
    "the reduction is more significant in the model with lower desorption energy of co , because n@xmath0h@xmath1 ( i.e. co freeze - out ) is confined to a layer closer to the midplane , where x - ray ionization rate is lower .",
