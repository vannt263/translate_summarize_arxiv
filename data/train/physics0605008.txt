    "mean field theories of the ginzburg - landau type have been proposed @xcite to explain the phenomenology associated with scaling and nucleation processes of earthquakes , which would in turn imply that a ginzburg criterion is applicable @xcite . if mean field ginzburg - landau equations do describe earthquakes , the dynamics must be operating outside the critical region , and fluctuations are correspondingly reduced .",
