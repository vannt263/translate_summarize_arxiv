    "quantum graphs , i.e. schrdinger operators with graph configuration spaces , were introduced in the middle of the last century @xcite and rediscovered three decades later @xcite . since then they attracted a lot of attention ; they became both a useful tool in numerous applications and a mean which makes easy to study fundamental properties such as quantum chaos .",
    "we refrain from giving an extensive bibliography and refer to the recent proceedings volume @xcite which the reader can use to check the state of art in this area",
    ".    one of the frequent questions concerns relations between the geometry of a graph @xmath4 and spectral properties of a schrdinger operator supported by @xmath4 .",
    "put like that , the question is a bit vague and allows different interpretation . on one hand , we can have in mind the intrinsic geometry of @xmath4 which enters the problem through the adjacency matrix of the graph and the lengths of its edges . on the other hand , quite often one thinks of @xmath4 as of a subset of @xmath5 with the geometry inherited from the ambient space . in that case",
    "geometric perturbations can acquire a rather illustrative meaning and one can ask in which way they influence spectral properties of a quantum particle `` living '' on @xmath4 ; in such a context one can think of graphs with various local deformations as `` bent '' , locally `` protruded '' or `` squeezed '' , etc .",
    "this is particularly interesting if the `` unperturbed '' system is explicitly solvable being , for instance , an infinite periodic graph .",
    "an influence of local spectral perturbations mentioned above is in this setting a rich subject which deserves to be investigated .",
    "so far it was considered only episodically but even such a brief look shows that it may have properties uncommon in the usual theory of schrdinger operators @xcite . with this motivation we find it useful to start such a programme by discussing the influence of a `` bending '' deformation on a graph which exhibits a one - dimensional periodicity .    to make things as simple as possible at the beginning we will not strive in this paper for generality and we will discuss in detail a simple nontrivial example , allowing for a fully explicit solution , in which the unperturbed system is a `` chain graph '' consisting of an array of rings of unit radius , cf .  fig .",
    "[ puvodni ] , connected through their touching points .        we suppose that there are no external fields . since values of physical constants are not important in our considerations we put @xmath6 and identify the particle hamiltonian with the ( negative ) laplacian acting as @xmath7 on each edge of the graph .",
    "it is well known that in order to get a self - adjoint operator one has to impose appropriate boundary conditions at the graph vertices . in our model",
    "we employ the so - called @xmath0-_coupling _ characterized by the conditions @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the index set numbering the edges emanating from the vertex  in our case @xmath10  and @xmath11 is the coupling constant supposed to be the same at every vertex of the chain .",
    "it is important that the `` straight '' graph has spectral gaps , thus we _ exclude the free boundary conditions _",
    "( sometimes called , not quite appropriately , kirchhoff ) , i.e. we assume @xmath12 .",
    "the geometric perturbation to consider is the simplest possible bending of such a chain obtained by a shift of one of the contact points , as sketched in fig .",
    "[ ohyb ] , which is parametrized by the bending angle @xmath13 characterizing the ratio of the two edges constituting the perturbed ring .",
    "our aim is to show that the bending gives rise to eigenvalues in the gaps of the unperturbed spectrum and to analyze how they depend on @xmath13 . at the same time",
    "the bent chain will exhibit resonances and we will discuss behaviour of the corresponding poles .",
    "the contents of the paper is the following . in the next section",
    "we analyze the straight chain . using bloch - floquet decomposition",
    "we will show that the spectrum consists of infinite number of absolutely continuous spectral bands separated by open gaps , plus a family of infinitely degenerate eigenvalues at band edges . in section  [ perturbace ] we will analyze the discrete spectrum due to the bending showing that in each gap it gives rise to at most two eigenvalues .",
    "section  [ reson ] describes their dependence on the bending angle as well as complex solutions to the spectral condition corresponding to resonances in the bent chain . in section  [ angle ]",
    "we discuss further the angular dependence with attention to singular points where the solutions coincide with the band edges .",
    "finally , in the concluding remarks we draw a parallel of our results with properties of quantum waveguides .",
    "first we consider a `` straight '' chain @xmath14 as sketched in fig .",
    "[ puvodni ] ; without loss of generality we may suppose that the circumference of each ring is @xmath15 . the state hilbert space of a nonrelativistic and spinless particle living on @xmath14 is @xmath16 .",
    "we suppose that the particle is free , not interacting with an external potentials on the edges , and denote by @xmath17 its hamiltonian , i.e. it acts as the negative laplacian on each graph link and its domain consists of all functions from @xmath18 which satisfy the @xmath0 boundary conditions ( [ delta ] ) at the vertices of @xmath14 ; we suppose that the coupling constant @xmath3 is the same at each vertex is kept fixed and for the sake of simplicity we will not use it to label the hamiltonian neither in the straight nor in the bent case . ] .        in view of the periodicity of @xmath14 , the spectrum of @xmath17",
    "can be computed using bloch - floquet decomposition .",
    "let us consider an elementary cell with the wavefunction components denoted according to the fig .",
    "[ bunka ] and ask about the spectrum of the floquet components of @xmath17 . since the operator acts as a negative second derivative ,",
    "each component of the eigenfunction with energy @xmath19 is a linear combination of the functions @xmath20 .",

    "the wavefunction components on the elementary cell are therefore given by @xmath28\\\\ \\psi_r(x)&=c_r^+\\e^{{{\\mathrm i}}k x}+c_r^-\\e^{-{{\\mathrm i}}k x},\\quad x\\in[0,\\pi/2]\\\\ \\varphi_l(x)&=d_l^+\\e^{{{\\mathrm i}}k x}+d_l^-\\e^{-{{\\mathrm i}}k x},\\quad x\\in[-\\pi/2,0]\\\\ \\varphi_r(x)&=d_r^+\\e^{{{\\mathrm i}}k x}+d_r^-\\e^{-{{\\mathrm i}}k x},\\quad x\\in[0,\\pi/2 ] \\end{split}\\ ] ] as we have said , at the contact point the @xmath0-coupling ( [ delta ] ) is assumed , i.e. @xmath29 \\label{vazba } \\\\[-.6em ] -\\psi_l'(0)+\\psi_r'(0)-\\varphi_l'(0)+\\varphi_r'(0)=\\alpha\\cdot\\psi_l(0 ) \\nonumber\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] on the other hand , at the `` free '' ends of the cell the floquet conditions are imposed , @xmath30 with @xmath31 running through @xmath32 ; alternatively we may say that the quasimomentum @xmath33 runs through @xmath34 , the brillouin zone of the problem .",
    "substituting   into   and , one obtains after simple manipulations @xmath35 where @xmath36 stands for @xmath37 or @xmath38 , hence @xmath39 and @xmath40 provided @xmath41 .",
    "we will treat the special case @xmath42 later , now we will suppose @xmath21 does not belong to @xmath43 , the set of natural numbers .",
    "furthermore , from   and   we obtain an equation for the phase factor @xmath44 , @xmath45 which has real coefficients for any @xmath46 and the discriminant equal to @xmath47 we have to determine values of @xmath48 for which there is a @xmath49 such that   is satisfied , in other words , for which @xmath48 it has , as an equation in the unknown @xmath44 , at least one root of modulus one .",
    "note that a pair of solutions of   always give one when multiplied , regardless the value of @xmath21 , hence either both roots are complex conjugated of modulus one , or one is of modulus greater than one and the other has modulus smaller than one .",
    "obviously , the latter situation corresponds to a positive discriminant , and the former one to the discriminant less or equal to zero .",
    "we summarize this discussion as follows :    [ pasy ] if @xmath50 and @xmath51 , then @xmath52 if and only if the condition @xmath53 is satisfied .",
    "in particular , the negative spectrum is obtained by putting @xmath24 for @xmath25 and rewriting the inequality   in terms of this variable .",
    "note that since @xmath54 for all @xmath55 , it never occurs that @xmath56 for @xmath57 , the positive imaginary axis , thus there is no need to treat this case separately like for @xmath58 , cf .   above .",
    "if @xmath25 , then @xmath59 if and only if @xmath60    let us finally mention the case @xmath42 left out above .",
    "it is straightforward to check that @xmath48 is then an eigenvalue , and moreover , that it has an infinite multiplicity .",
    "one can construct an eigenfunction which is supported by a single circle , which is given by @xmath61 with @xmath62 $ ] on the upper semicircle and @xmath63 with @xmath62 $ ] on the lower one .",
    "[ updown ] the condition   reminds us of the corresponding condition in the kronig - penney model with the distance between the interaction sites equal to @xmath64 , cf .",
    "@xcite , the only difference being that the coupling constant is halved , @xmath65 instead of @xmath3 .",
    "in contrast to that , the point spectrum of the kp model is empty .",
    "these facts are easy to understand if we realize that our model has the up - down mirror symmetry , and thus @xmath17 decomposes into a symmetric and antisymmetric part .",
    "the former is unitarily equivalent to the kp model with modified coupling , the latter corresponds to functions vanishing at the vertices , having thus a pure point spectrum . looking ahead",
    ", we remark that the bending perturbation breaks this mirror symmetry .",
    "finally , in the case @xmath26 we get in the similar way the equation @xmath66 replacing  , whence we infer that @xmath67 if and only if @xmath68 hence zero can belong to the continuous part of the spectrum only and it happens _ iff _",

    ", we can make the following claim about @xmath70 .",
    "[ bands ]    the spectrum of @xmath17 consists of infinitely degenerate eigenvalues equal to @xmath71 with @xmath72 , and absolutely continuous spectral bands with the following properties : + if @xmath73 , then every spectral band is contained in an interval @xmath74 $ ] with @xmath75 , and its upper edge coincides with the value @xmath76 .",
    "+ if @xmath77 , then in each interval @xmath78 with @xmath72 there is exactly one spectral band the lower edge of which coincides with @xmath71 . in addition , there is a spectral band with the lower edge ( being the overall spectral threshold ) equal to @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the largest solution of @xmath81 the position of the upper edge of this band depends on @xmath3 . if @xmath82 , then it is equal to @xmath48 where @xmath21 is the solution of @xmath83 contained in @xmath84 . on the other hand , for @xmath85",
    "the upper edge is negative , @xmath79 with @xmath80 being the smallest solution of , and for @xmath86 it equals zero .",
    "+ finally , @xmath87 holds if @xmath88 .",
    "the degenerate bands , in other words , the eigenvalues of infinite multiplicity , were found already and it is straightforward to check that no other eigenvalues exist .",
    "the continuous spectrum can be in view of remark  [ updown ] treated as in @xcite , nevertheless , we sketch the argument not only to make the paper self - contained , but also in view of next sections where some ideas and formula of the present proof will be used again .    consider first the positive part of the continuous spectrum .",
    "the condition   clearly determines bands with one endpoint at @xmath89 , where the sign of @xmath3 decides whether it is the upper or lower one .",
    "if @xmath77 , the presence of a band in ( 0,1 ) depends on @xmath90 . denoting @xmath91 we want to show that @xmath92 is either empty or an interval with zero as its edge .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath93 maps @xmath84 continuously into @xmath94 ; we will check that @xmath95 implies @xmath96 .",
    "we notice first that the premise implies @xmath97 ; taking the square of this relation we find after simple manipulations that @xmath98 and @xmath99 . evaluating @xmath100 and substituting these expressions we get @xmath101 these properties together with the continuity of @xmath93 imply that if @xmath102 is not empty , then it is an interval with the left endpoint zero .",

    "@xmath114 because then @xmath118 .",
    "in such a case the lowest spectral band is the closure of @xmath119 , otherwise it is the closure of @xmath117 only .",
    "let us suppose now that the straight chain of the previous section suffers a bending perturbation as shown in figure  [ ohyb ] .",

    "furthermore , we have seen that the behaviour of eigenvalues in vicinity of the singular points is the following , @xmath308{\\frac{\\alpha}{4}}\\frac{k_0}{\\pi}\\ ,    particular case @xmath309 , @xmath285 , as well provided the band edge @xmath310 is odd .",
    "however , @xmath127 has an eigenvalue near @xmath309 also in the gaps adjacent to even numbers . in these cases",
    "the curve starts at the point @xmath311 for @xmath310 being the solution of @xmath312 in @xmath313 , @xmath314 even .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath21 for @xmath13 close to zero is then different , namely :    [ gentle ] suppose that @xmath72 is even and @xmath310 is as described above , i.e. @xmath315 is the right endpoint of the spectral gap adjacent to @xmath71 .",
    "then the behaviour of the solution of   in the neighbourhood of @xmath311 is given by @xmath316 where @xmath317 .",
    "the argument is straightforward , it suffices to use taylor expansions in  .",
    "the analogous asymptotic behaviour applies to @xmath48 , the energy distance of the eigenvalue from the band edge is again proportional to @xmath318 in the leading order .",

    "we refrain from discussing in detail the odd part @xmath128 of the hamiltonian .",
    "the corresponding results are practically the same , the only difference is that the roles of the even and odd gaps are interchanged .",
    "most of what we have discussed above modifies easily to the case of attractive coupling with the obvious changes : for @xmath77 the spectral gaps lay now _ below _ the numbers @xmath71 , @xmath72 .",
    "of particular interest is the spectral gap adjacent to the value one , because with the increase of @xmath90 its lower edge moves towards zero and may become negative for @xmath90 large enough .",
    "the even part @xmath127 has similar properties as before : the eigenvalue curve goes from @xmath84 to @xmath319 , where @xmath320 , and there two complex conjugated branches with @xmath321 one of which describes a resonance .",

    "the spectral condition   for @xmath128 is valid for @xmath326 .",
    "if we put all terms to the left - hand side denoting it as @xmath327 , i.e. @xmath328 with the sign in the denominator properly chosen , we have @xmath329 for @xmath330 while for @xmath331 the limit is real - valued and non - vanishing .",
    "it follows that to find the behaviour at the crossing point one has to examine the function given implicitly by @xmath332 , where @xmath333 \\lim_{k\\to0}\\frac{\\g^-(\\vartheta , k)}{k^2 } & \\textrm{for $ k=0 $ } \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] this is continuous and it can be easily checked that it has continuous partial derivatives with respect to @xmath13 and @xmath21 in the neighbourhood of any solution of @xmath332 with @xmath334 .",

    "we have reasons to believe that the spectral and resonance properties due geometric perturbations of the considered type hold much more generally . in this paper",
    "we have decided , however , to treat the present simple example because it allowed us to find a rather explicit solution of the problem .",
    "the problem can be viewed from different perspectives . as an alternative",
    "one may interpret the chain graph as a _ decoration _ of a simple array - type graph , or if you wish , the kronig - penney model , in the sense of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the results of the paper then say that _ a local modification _ of the decoration can produce a discrete spectrum in the gaps and the other effects discussed here .",
    "it is also interesting to draw a parallel between the quantum graphs discussed here and _ quantum waveguides _ ,",
    "i.e. laplacians in tubular domains .",
    "although the nature of the the two system is very different , they nevertheless share some properties , in particular , the existence of bound states below the essential spectrum threshold due to a local bend .",
    "this effect is well studied for dirichlet quantum waveguides where it is known for a gentle bend the binding energy is proportional to the fourth power of the bending angle @xcite , i.e. it has exactly the same behaviour as described by theorem  [ gentle ] .",
    "bent quantum waveguides with mixed ( or robin ) boundary conditions were also studied @xcite and it was shown that the effect of _ binding through bending _ is present for any repulsive boundary . in our case",
    "an eigenvalue below the lowest band exists whenever @xmath2 which inspires another look at the waveguide case .",
