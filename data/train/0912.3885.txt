    "the galactic center ( gc ) is a fascinating environment containing a multitude of extraordinary phenomena and extraordinary objects , not the least of which are three dense clusters of young and hot stars and a multi - million solar mass black hole .",
    "until recently it was thought that the interstellar gas within the central few hundred parsecs of the galaxy , usually referred to as the central molecular zone ( hereafter cmz ) consisted of three major components @xcite : ultra high temperature x - ray - emitting plasma ; ionized gas at t@xmath010@xmath4  k responsible for the well - studied fine structure and radio recombination line emission ; and cool and dense molecular clouds , which have also been observed in considerable detail at radio wavelengths .",
    "however , recent infrared spectroscopy of h@xmath2 and co , and in particular of the key @xmath5(3,3)@xmath6 absorption line from a metastable state of h@xmath2 @xcite , has clearly revealed the presence of another component , which in terms of density ( 50200 @xmath7 ) has the characteristics of galactic diffuse cloud material , but which is considerably warmer ( 200300  k ) . at present , this warm dilute environment is unique to the gc ; it has not been found in any other galactic diffuse clouds surveyed in h@xmath2 ( geballe & oka , unpublished data ) .",
    "it appears to include gas associated with the r  @xmath0  180  pc expanding molecular ring ( hereafter emr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which has also been characterized as an expanding molecular shell @xcite , located at the outer edge of the cmz .",
    "because of the unique properties of h@xmath2 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , observations of h@xmath2 , combined with those of co , are key to characterizing the physical conditions in the cmz and the extent of the warm and diffuse component there . however , spectroscopy of h@xmath2 is difficult because its lines are weak owing to its low abundance . until recently there has been available as probes of the line of sight to the gc only a small number of hot stars in the central cluster and in or near the quintuplet cluster 30  pc east , which are both sufficiently bright for high resolution spectroscopy and have smooth infrared spectra so that the h@xmath2 line profiles are uncontaminated by photospheric absorption lines in the background source .",
    "spectra of these already - known sources @xcite have shown that the warm and diffuse component is present on every sightline and also have shown that the h@xmath2 column lengths are substantial fractions of the radius of the cmz .",
    "they thus suggest that the diffuse and warm environment in which the h@xmath2 is located takes up a large fraction of the volume in the central few hundred parsecs .",
    "if correct , this would strongly contradict the previous conceptual picture of gc gas , e.g. , as illustrated in @xcite , in which a warm and diffuse component has not been included at all .",
    "to better evaluate the extent and physical nature of this newly discovered environment , sightlines providing a wider coverage of the cmz are needed .",
    "it is therefore essential to find additional bright sources with featureless or nearly featureless spectra  either hot stars with few emission or absorption lines , or stars encased in dense shells of warm dust  in a more extended region of the gc .",
    "the cmz is filled with bright infrared sources , but everywhere except at locations of the three clusters of luminous hot stars ( the central , arches , and quintuplet clusters ) the overwhelming majority of them are red giants , whose complex photospheric absorption spectra make them unsuitable as probes of the interstellar medium . until very recently , no smooth - spectrum objects in the line of sight to the cmz but far from those clusters were known .",
    "we are using the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) point source catalogue @xcite and the _ spitzer space telescope _ glimpse catalogue @xcite to identify bright objects in the direction of the cmz that are likely to have opaque dust shells .",
    "a simplified description of the technique is that the shorter wavelength ir colors are mainly used to weed out foreground ( low extinction ) sources and  normal \" red giants , and the longer wavelength ir colors are mainly used to identify emission from warm dust .",
    "however , the situation is far from straightforward , because the effects on 18  @xmath8 m photometry of high extinction and low temperature can not be easily separated . our success rate ,",
    "although much higher than a random sampling , is currently only @xmath015% .",
    "thus a check of each candidate is necessary before proceeding to the time - consuming high - resolution spectroscopy .",
    "this second step is performed by obtaining quick medium - resolution @xmath9-band spectra , in particular covering the first overtone co bands at 2.32.5  @xmath8 m , to determine if the candidates do indeed have smooth spectra or are cool red giants suffering high extinction .",
    "our requirement for high resolution spectroscopy of the key lines of h@xmath2 , which mostly lie in the 3.53.7  @xmath8 m region , is that the sources have infrared array camera ( irac ) band 1 ( 3.6  @xmath8 m ) magnitudes brighter than 8 .",
    "roughly 2,000 glimpse sources with @xmath101.2@xmath1  @xmath11  @xmath12  @xmath11  + 1.2@xmath1 and @xmath100.1@xmath1  @xmath11  @xmath13  @xmath11  + 0.1@xmath1 ( here @xmath12 and @xmath13 are offsets in galactic longitude and latitude from sgr  a * , assumed to be at a distance of 8.0  kpc ) satisfy that criterion .",
    "most of them have 2mass counterparts .",
    "based on 2mass @xmath14 , 2mass / spitzer @xmath9@xmath10irac(1 ) and spitzer irac(1)@xmath10irac(4 ) ( 8.0  @xmath8 m ) colors , we have compiled a list of @xmath0250 candidate dusty sources that to our knowledge had not previously been observed spectroscopically .",
    "@xmath9-band spectra of approximately 75 of them now have been obtained . of those , ten ,",
    "whose locations are shown in figure  1 , have been found to be suitable for high resolution spectroscopy of interstellar gas lines .",
    "we have no additional information concerning the natures of these ten sources .",
    "they are likely to contain either young stellar objects or luminous evolved stars .    at the stage that the @xmath9-band spectroscopy has revealed suitable sources , the locations of those sources along the line of sight are unknown .",
    "although we attempt to select for high interstellar extinction , it is quite possible that some of the sources are situated in front of the gc .",
    "high resolution spectroscopy of co first overtone lines originating in low @xmath15 levels of the ground vibrational state can help to locate the sources on the line of sight .",
    "previous observations by @xcite have demonstrated that the spectra of objects in the gc show narrow absorption components of h@xmath2 and co arising in foreground spiral arms .",
    "the presence or absence of absorption components at the characteristic velocities of these foreground arms can provide useful constraints .",
    "however , the clouds along the intervening spiral arms may not be continuous , but instead clumpy on small scales . thus the lack of an absorption at a velocity characteristic of a spiral arm does not necessarily prove that the object is located in front of that arm .    despite the low efficiency and the possibilities of confusion about location on the line of sight ,",
    "the technique already shows great promise of providing a more extensive and more unifom sampling of the molecular gas in the cmz than previously available .",
    "in particular , the sightlines toward two of newly found objects , 2mass j174332173@xmath102951430 and 2mass j17470898@xmath102829561 ( hereafter 2m1743 and 2m1747 , respectively ) , contain remarkable collections of interstellar clouds absorbing in lines of co and h@xmath2 . in the following sections we describe the exploratory spectra we have obtained of them .",
    "medium - resolution 1.42.5  @xmath8 m spectra of 2m1743 ( @xmath9  =  6.5 ) and 2m1747 ( @xmath9  =  10.4 ) were obtained at the united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) on mauna kea on 2008 july 28 and august 15 , respectively , using the facility imager / spectrograph uist , whose 0.2  wide slit provided a resolving power of 1000 . on both nights hr  6409 ( f6",
    "iv ) was observed at roughly the same air mass as the 2mass objects for the purposes of flux calibration and removal of telluric lines .",
    "total integration times on the 2mass objects were 80 and 360 seconds , respectively .",
    "observations were made in stare / nod - along - slit mode .",
    "data reduction was standard for near - infrared spectroscopy of point sources .",
    "wavelength calibration was obtained from telluric absorption lines observed in hr  6409 and is accurate to better than 0.0005  @xmath8 m .",
    "the 2.166  @xmath8 m br  @xmath16 absorption line in hr  6409 was removed by interpolation prior to ratioing .",
    "the 2.02.4  @xmath8 m portions of the spectra of the two objects are shown in fig .  2 .",
    "2m1743 has a smooth and steeply rising spectrum , consistent with that of a dust - embedded star .",
    "the spectrum of 2m1747 , which rises even more steeply , is also indicative of warm dust .",
    "however , while the spectrum of 2m1743 appears featureless at this resolution , that of 2m1747 shows several significant absorptions .",
    "these include the 20 and 31 band heads of co , perhaps originating in the veiled photosphere of a cool and luminous star or in a dense and high - temperature circumstellar shell or disk of a young stellar object .",
    "in addition , significant absorption is seen near the wavelength of the 20 co band center ( 2.347  @xmath8 m ) , suggesting the presence of an unusually large column density of lower temperature ( interstellar ) co. finally , a broad absorption band , centered at approximately 2.265  @xmath8 m , is present .",
    "it has a full width at zero intensity of @xmath0  0.02  @xmath8 m .",
    "we are unable to identify this feature .",
    "its wavelength range encompasses that of the triplet of neutral calcium lines seen in late - type stars @xcite ; however , the feature is too broad and too strong relative to co for that identification to be viable .",
    "it is possible that the absorption is produced in frozen grain mantles within molecular clouds along the line of sight .",
    "an absorption at 2.27  @xmath8 m with a similar profile , possibly due to solid methanol , has been observed in some solar system objects @xcite .",
    "high resolution spectra of both objects at the @xmath5(1,1)@xmath6 transition of h@xmath2 near 3.715  @xmath8 m and covering a small portion of the 20 band of co near 2.342  @xmath8 m were obtained at the gemini south telescope on cerro pachon in chile on 2009 july 6 .",
    "the observations used the echelle spectrograph , phoenix , whose 0.34  wide slit provides a resolving power of 50,000 . in one setting",
    "the spectral coverage corresponds to @xmath17@xmath18/@xmath18  =  0.0045 on the instrument s detector array . for the co",
    "spectra the echelle was centered at 2.342  @xmath8 m , thereby covering the five lowest lying @xmath5 branch transitions of the 20 band , i.e. , @xmath5(0)@xmath5(4 ) .",
    "the separation of adjacent 20 rovibrational co lines corresponds to a velocity range of 260  km  s@xmath19 ; thus if the absorption profile is broad the baseline for defining the continuum level between co lines is restricted .",
    "the other setting was centered on the wavelength of the h@xmath2 line , whose lower level is the ground state .",
    "data reduction was similar to that described earlier , with hr  6070 ( a0v ) and hr  7254 ( a2v ) serving as standards for both wavelength intervals .",
    "wavelength calibrations used telluric absorption lines , and the resultant velocity scales in figures 3 and 4 are accurate to 2  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "profiles of the h@xmath2 line and the co @xmath5(0)@xmath5(3 ) lines observed toward 2m1743 are shown in figure  3 .",
    "absorption components of co are present at lsr velocities of @xmath1060 , @xmath10172 , and @xmath10200 km  s@xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath10172 km  s@xmath3 absorption profile is slightly asymmetric , indicating the presence of a second and weaker absorption red - shifted by a few km  s@xmath3 .",
    "the h@xmath2 @xmath5(1,1)@xmath6 spectrum also contains prominent absorption components , including the same three seen in co , and a red - shifted shoulder on the @xmath10172 km  s@xmath3 absorption that is relatively stronger than in co. a fourth prominent absorption in the h@xmath2 spectrum , which is not present in co , is an apparent velocity doublet at 0 and + 8 km  s@xmath3 .",
    "finally , broad but weaker h@xmath2 absorptions , which also have no counterparts in co , are centered near @xmath1027 and @xmath1075  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "the co absorptions observed at @xmath1060 , @xmath10172 , and @xmath10200 km  s@xmath3 are likely to be formed in dense clouds . only the first four rotational levels are significantly populated .",
    "the overall co excitation temperature is roughly 10  k , but it is quite possible that the kinetic temperature is higher and that the level populations are sub - thermal . a more thorough analysis will be provided in a subsequent paper .",
    "the component at -60  km  s@xmath3 possibly arises in the 3  kpc arm . on sightlines much closer to the center",
    "the absorption ascribed to that spiral arm occurs near @xmath1052  km  s@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the other two co components , at much higher velocity , do not correspond to foreground spiral arms . because of their high velocities it is likely that these features arise close to the gc .",
    "co @xmath15=10 spectra obtained by @xcite approximately along this sightline ( @xmath20  =  358.954@xmath1 ,",
    "@xmath21  =  @xmath100.066@xmath1 ) have their strongest emission components at those two high negative velocities .    because no infrared co absorption is present at the velocities of the h@xmath2 absorptions near 0 , + 8 , and @xmath1075  km  s@xmath3",
    ", the clouds producing them must be diffuse .",
    "only weak co @xmath15=10 line emission is present at those velocities .",
    "2m1743 is located within a few parsecs of the galactic plane and is approximately 140  pc west of the center ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "if it is located somewhat behind the center , its sightline would cross the emr where its gas is moving nearly in the plane of the sky ( with very little doppler shift ) .",
    "it is thus logical to associate the low velocity doublet with the emr and to place 2m1743 somewhat behind the emr .",
    "previous observations have demonstrated that the emr contains diffuse gas @xcite .",
    "if the identification is correct , it is evidence that the diffuse nature of the emr s gas is widespread , and is not limited to the sightlines close to the longitudes of the central and quintuplet clusters .",
    "we have no specific identification for the h@xmath2 features at @xmath1027  km  s@xmath3 and @xmath1075  km  s@xmath3 . however , previously observed gc slightlines @xcite showed a trough of absorption by diffuse gas from 0 to @xmath10100  km  s@xmath3 , indicating that a significant fraction of the volume of the cmz contains diffuse gas .",
    "if so , then the presence of additional h@xmath2 absorption components in that velocity range would not be surprising .",
    "velocity profiles of the h@xmath2 line and the co @xmath5(0)@xmath5(3 ) lines toward 2m1747 are displayed in figure  4 .",
    "both molecules absorb continuously over wide velocity ranges .",
    "absorption by co extends without interuption from @xmath10100 to + 100  km  s@xmath3 , and the absorption by h@xmath2 extends even further without a break , from @xmath10130 to + 100  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "about a dozen discrete velocity components can be seen in both the h@xmath2 and co line profiles .",
    "several , but not all of the components of the two molecules coincide , and thus the sightline appears to contain a combination of diffuse and dense clouds , but at present it is not possible to untangle the two contributions .",
    "the only clear indication of gas with a low excitation temperature similar to that seen in the co toward 2m1743 is at @xmath1043  km  s@xmath3 , where the strongest absorption occurs in the @xmath15  =  0 , 1 , and 2 levels and where the co absorption depth noticeably decreases with increasing lower state energy .",
    "this absorption component may be a continuation of absorption by molecular gas in the 3  kpc arm , as discussed previously for 2m1743 .    at @xmath20",
    "=  0.548@xmath1 ,",
    "@xmath21  =  @xmath100.060@xmath1 , 2m1747 is located approximately 85  pc east of the galactic center on the line of sight to the sgr b giant molecular cloud complex , and is almost directly between sgr  b1 and sgr  b2 ( figure  1 ) .",
    "the co @xmath15=10 spectra of @xcite at this location shows a strong and complex emission profile at positive velocities , not very different from those seen in the infrared co and h@xmath2 lines , but very little emission at negative velocities where both the infrared co and h@xmath2 absorptions also are strong .",
    "given the unprecedented large widths of the h@xmath2 @xmath5(1,1)@xmath6 and interstellar co lines ( that of the h@xmath2 line is roughly twice that previously reported for any other gc sightline ) , it seems beyond doubt that 2m1747 lies within sgr  b. to our knowledge the absorption spectra in figure  4 are the first near - infrared views into that complex and turbulent star - forming region .",
    "the spectra presented here represent the beginning of a new phase of exploration of the cmz using absorption spectroscopy of h@xmath2 and co along new sightlines , which has already yielded striking results .",
    "more detailed understanding of the gas on these two new sightlines , as well as on others that have been or are likely to be found , will require spectroscopy of additional transitions of h@xmath2 , in particular of the @xmath5(2,2)@xmath6 and @xmath5(3,3)@xmath6 lines , arising from higher energy levels than the @xmath5(1,1)@xmath6 line , and detailed comparison with infrared and millimeter spectra of co and perhaps other molecular species .",
