    "in order to explain the present and initial accelerated expansions of the universe a large variety of modified theories of gravity has been proposed in recent years . among them , one of the most popular is @xmath0 modified gravity where the gravitational action depends on a general function of the curvature scalar @xmath1 , see @xcite for two reviews . to derive the gravitational field equations from those modified actions ,",
    "two approaches are extensively used in the literature : the metric and the palatini variational principles ( see @xcite for recent extensions of the palatini variational method in modify gravity ) . in the so called metric approach",
    "one takes the metric @xmath2 as the only dynamical variable and considers only variations of the action with respect to it .",
    "the so called palatini approach is based on the idea of considering the connection defining the riemann curvature tensor to be _ a priori _ independent of the metric . as such",
    ", one performs variations of the action with respect to the metric and the connection independently .",
    "both approaches have been used extensively to build cosmological models , many of which contain an era of accelerated expansion .",
    "it is well - known that @xmath0 theories are dynamically equivalent to brans - dicke ( bd ) theories .",
    "in fact , metric @xmath0 gravity has been shown to be dynamically equivalent to a brans - dicke theories with vanishing bd parameter while palatini @xmath0 gravity presents the same equivalence if the bd parameter equals @xmath3 ( see again @xcite ) .",
    "the value @xmath3 for the bd parameter is a peculiar one since it implies no dynamics for the scalar field in bd theories .",
    "consequently , palatini @xmath0 gravity has the same number of dynamical degrees of freedom as general relativity , see  @xcite for a very different model which does not introduce new dynamical degrees of freedom either .",
    "more recently , a novel approach to modified gravity has been introduced where a palatini - like @xmath4 term is added to the metric einstein - hilbert action @xcite . in this",
    "context cosmological and astrophysical applications together with wormholes geometries have been studied in @xcite , where it has also been shown that viable accelerating cosmological solutions are allowed by some specific models .",
    "the theory is dynamically equivalent to a scalar - tensor theory with non - minimal coupling to gravity given by @xmath5 where @xmath1 is the metric curvature scalar and @xmath6 is the scalar field .",
    "this is done in strict analogy with palatini @xmath0 gravity and indeed the bd parameter for this theory is still @xmath3 . however , because of the different coupling to @xmath1 than in bd theories , in this theory the scalar field is dynamical and represents a new dynamical degree of freedom .    in the present paper",
    "we analyze a natural extension of the theory introduced in @xcite .",
    "we introduce a general function which depends on both the metric and palatini curvature scalars .",
    "we show that this new generalization can be considered as dynamically equivalent to a gravitational theory with two scalar fields",
    ". only one of these scalar fields is non - minimally coupled to @xmath1 and in general an interaction between the two appears in the action .",
    "the cosmological features of the theory are then studied using dynamical system techniques .",
    "let us define @xmath7 and start from the action @xmath8 which generalizes the so - called hybrid metric - palatini action of @xcite . in action ( [ 004 ]",
    ") @xmath1 is the ricci curvature scalar formed with the levi - civita connection , @xmath9 while @xmath10 is the curvature scalar of an independent torsionless connection @xmath11 , in analogy with the palatini approach .",
    "the variation of the action  ( [ 004 ] ) with respect to the independent connection @xmath11 leads to @xmath12 whose solution is a levi - civita connection in terms of the conformal metric @xmath13 , @xmath14    the variation with respect to the metric yields @xmath15 where also the matter action has been considered in the variation . because of ( [ 001 ] ) , @xmath16 can be related to @xmath17 and terms involving ( derivatives of ) @xmath18 as in palatini @xmath0 .",
    "however the trace of ( [ 002 ] ) now relates @xmath19 and its derivatives to @xmath20 and @xmath2 , meaning that it is not possible in general to solve for @xmath19 .",
    "however , this can be avoided by requiring @xmath21 . in this particular case the trace of ( [ 002 ] ) becomes an algebraic equation in @xmath19 which can be solved for @xmath20 and ( derivatives of ) @xmath2 .",
    "note that in the following we will keep the function @xmath22 completely arbitrary as it turns out that all results we will obtain hold for any ( sufficiently smooth ) function @xmath22 .",
    "let us start by considering the action @xmath23 \\ , ,    \\label{003}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are two scalar fields . variation with respect to @xmath24 and @xmath25 gives the system @xmath26 whose only solution is given by @xmath27 and @xmath28 , provided that @xmath29 this condition follows simply from requiring that this matrix type equation is non - degenerate .",
    "it is interesting to note that the matrix involved is in fact the hessian of @xmath22 .",
    "since our theory is based on an action principle , a non - degenerate hessian in this context means nothing but that solutions of the field equations derived from the action are indeed stationary points of the action .",
    "it is now clear that substituting this solution back into action ( [ 003 ] ) produce immediately action ( [ 004 ] ) .",
    "the two actions are thus dynamically equivalent .",
    "constraint ( [ 029 ] ) excludes from our analysis the cases when the function @xmath22 is linear in either @xmath24 ( i.e.  @xmath1 ) or @xmath25 ( i.e.  @xmath10 ) .",
    "however the first case is nothing but the hybrid metric - palatini theory studied in @xcite , while the second is equivalent to usual metric @xmath0 theories .",
    "moreover constraint ( [ 029 ] ) excludes also some particular models such as @xmath30 or @xmath31 .",
    "we have thus to reduce the results of this section to the models satisfying ( [ 029 ] ) .",
    "let us define two new scalar fields as @xmath32 the minus sign in the definition of @xmath33 is required in order not to allow for a negative kinetic energy of the field .",

    "\\label{030}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is possible to think of action ( [ 030 ] ) as a brans - dicke theory with vanishing bd parameter and a potential interacting with another minimally coupled scalar field .    at this point",
    "we can perform a conformal transformation in order to switch from the jordan to the einstein frame .",
    "the transformation @xmath40 allows then , up to surface terms , to rewrite action ( [ 030 ] ) as @xmath41 \\,.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] finally , we redefine the two scalar fields as @xmath42 and the action becomes @xmath43 \\",

    "usually these studies start from a more general action than ( [ 030 ] ) where also a kinetic term for @xmath6 is considered , but do not allow for a coupling between the two scalar fields in the potential @xcite .",
    "a more general coupling between the scalar @xmath6 and @xmath1 was considered in @xcite . in the einstein frame",
    "this leads to a general function of @xmath45 in the exponential coupling to the kinetic term of @xmath46 .",
    "in general we can address action ( [ 031 ] ) as a specific model of brans - dicke inflation with vanishing bd parameter .",
    "this means that from hybrid metric - palatini gravity we have a natural explanation for introducing both the inflaton and the brans - dicke scalar fields .",
    "we refer to @xcite for recent developments in the context of two - field inflation .    in the next section",
    "we will analyze the general cosmological dynamics of the theory in the einstein frame .",

    "the field equations can be obtained by varying action ( [ 031 ] ) with respect to the dynamical variables @xmath2 , @xmath6 and @xmath33 . the gravitational field equations in the einstein frame are thus given by @xmath48 where we define @xmath49 for the moment we assume that every other form of matter is negligible in comparison to the two scalar fields .",

    "we have now four qualitative behaviours for the dynamics of the phase space depending again on the possible values of @xmath89 : @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",

    "the first range is again the more interesting since we can have a late time attractor where the universe is accelerating its expansion .",

    "the late time attractor is point @xmath83 which results in an accelerating solution whenever @xmath84 .",
    "point @xmath85 represents a saddle point where the universe is completely dominated by the matter sector and expands according to radiation / dust solutions .",
    "it is then clear that every trajectory passing nearby point @xmath85 and eventually ending in point @xmath83 describes a possible physical universe .",
    "in fact all these solutions will allow the universe to undergo the standard radiation and matter eras before the transition to the dark energy accelerating solution .     and @xmath96 .",
    "the global attractor is still point @xmath87 but now the trajectories starting from the @xmath88 plane are first attracted by saddle point @xmath97 . ]    as an example we can look at the dashed / red solution in fig .  [ fig:05 ] and see how the effective equation of state parameter evolves .",
    "this is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig:06 ] .",
    "we see that the universe immediately reaches a matter dominated expansion and keeps this evolution for some time unperturbed . of course",
    "if the matter equation of state parameter @xmath98 changed during this period , from radiation to dust in a physical situation , also @xmath99 would change according to @xmath98 .",
    "this means that during this period the universe has the time to undergoes the standard cosmological eras in agreement with the observations .",
    "depending on the initial conditions this stage can last for the time needed to produce the nucleosyntesis and create the cosmological structures .",
    "eventually we will have the transition to the accelerated phase which represents the final phase of the universe where the effective equation of state parameter assumes the value @xmath100 .",
    "the situation is completely equivalent to quintessence plus dark matter with @xmath6 playing the role of the dark energy scalar field .",
    "in fact the trajectories confined to the border of the sphere , such as the dashe / red one in fig .",
    "[ fig:05 ] , must have @xmath101 meaning that @xmath33 does not influence the dynamics of this solutions .     and @xmath96 .",
    "the global attractor is point @xmath87 but now @xmath102 is a saddle point attracting the @xmath88 trajectories . ]",
    "we can now look at the second range @xmath91 whose phase space is drawn in fig.[fig:07 ] .",
    "the global attractor is now point @xmath87 where the universe expands according to the matter equation of state .",
    "depending on the initial conditions the trajectories can either pass nearby saddle point @xmath85 , where we also have @xmath103 , or pass through the region surrounding the point @xmath104 where the universe accelerates its expansion and eventually approaches saddle point @xmath83 before ending to point @xmath87 .",
    "this shows how this model can be useful in early inflationary dynamics since we can have an accelerated period before the universe start to be radiation / dust dominated .",
    "this feature is presented also in the third possible range @xmath92 as fig .",
    "[ fig:08 ] shows .",
    "for this reason and because the phase space properties are more evident , we chose to show the dynamics in the @xmath96 case .",
    "we still have point @xmath87 as the global attractor , but now , besides point @xmath83 , also point @xmath97 act as saddle point influencing trajectories starting from the @xmath88 plane .",
    "the dynamics is similar to the second @xmath89-range with several solutions experiencing an accelerated phase before ending in the matter dominated final evolution .    finally the phase space for the last range @xmath93 is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:09 ] .",
    "point @xmath83 is now gone and point @xmath102 plays its role attracting the @xmath88 trajectories .",
    "the dynamics is again similar to the previous ranges with point @xmath87 being the global attractor and solutions having a possible era of cosmic accelerated expansion depending on the initial conditions .",
    "in this paper we have studied a natural generalization of the so - called hybrid metric - palatini gravity introduced in @xcite . a completely arbitrary function of both the metric and palatini curvature scalars was considered as the lagrangian density in the action . using dynamically equivalent actions and conformal transformation techniques , we have shown that this new theory can be recast into general relativity plus two scalar fields coupled with each other .",
    "therefore , using this approach one arrives naturally at theories where the different matter components couple to each other .",
    "it should be emphasized that there are no theoretical restrictions when it comes to coupling different matter components , all that is required by general relativity and its generalisation is that the total energy - momentum tensor is conserved .",
    "we analyzed the possible applications to cosmology considering a flrw universe and employing dynamical system methods .",
    "three specific models specified by their potentials were studied in detail and in each case a late time cosmological accelerated solution has been found .",
    "depending on the model parameters these can represent global attractor solutions .",
    "we also encountered a rather peculiar parameter choice ( fig .",
    "[ fig:12 ] ) where the dynamical system has no global attractor and the cosmological solution would never stop evolving .    the first model has a potential without coupling the two scalar fields and shows several similarities with usual quintessence models .",
    "the second model considers a direct coupling between the two scalars in the potential and it is characterized by more mathematical complexity .",
    "its evolution is easily understood .",
    "finally , in the third and most interesting model we add standard ( dark ) matter to the theory and show that the universe can undergo a ` extended period ' of matter domination followed by an accelerating dark energy dominated era .",
    "this would in principle allow for structure formation in this model .",
    "it would be interesting to study such models in more details studying not only the background evolution but also the evolution of perturbation on this background and in particular structure formation .",
    "this would eventually allow us to compare such models with experimental data .",
