    "so far the main sources of diffuse galactic microwave emission known to be present are thermal dust , synchrotron , and free - free .",
    "the identification and removal of free - free emission is not straightforward as it is likely to dominate the other two sources only in a small range of frequencies ( around 60 ghz ) . galactic @xmath0 line emission , which is produced by the same warm ionized medium ( wim ) responsible for free - free emission , can be a good tracer of free - free emission at high galactic latitudes where there is expected to be minimal extinction from dust .",
    "recently it has been proposed that there is at least indirect evidence for the presence of another component of galactic emission , spinning dust emission from rotationally excited small dust grains .",
    "the model of draine & lazarian ( 1998a , b ) predicts a microwave emission spectrum for this component that peaks at low frequencies ( @xmath1 10@xmath230 ghz ) , with the details of the spectrum , such as the location of the peak , dependent on properties of the dust grains and their environment .",
    "specialized observations directed towards picking out this component are being conducted and the first tentative detection has been reported in finkbeiner et al .",

    "1996b , then this relation will be independent of scale . ) however , if this correlated emission were really free - free emission , then a similar correlation should exist between @xmath0 and ir emission emission is @xmath9 , at wavelength @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the brightness temperature for free - free emission , @xmath12 is the intensity of @xmath0 emission , and the power law index on the gas temperature changes from 0.55 for temperature @xmath13 k to 0.85 for @xmath14 k , so that at high temperatures there is a greater contrast in the levels of free - free and @xmath0 emission .",
    "the assumptions that go into deriving this relation include a fraction of singly ionized helium of unity , a helium to hydrogen ratio of 0.08 , an approximate expression for the gaunt factor , and further the relation is valid only for lines of sight in which interstellar extinction is negligible ( reynolds & haffner 2002 ) . ] .",

    "correlation slopes obtained ( reynolds et al .",

    "2002 ) are a factor of a few lower than what is expected based on the microwave - ir correlation slopes and have significant uncertainties at present .",
    "however , if the microwave - ir correlations are only in part due to free - free emission , then this may be acceptable .",
    "this ratio may also vary across the sky due to the variation in the hydrogen ionization fraction an d optical extinction along different lines of sight ( de oliveira - costa et al .",

    "while the cause of microwave - ir correlations is still under discussion , we present a correlation analysis of the ovro and sp94 microwave data with templates of dust emission including the 12 @xmath5 m template , and new @xmath0 templates , to see whether we are able to separate free - free emission and detect spinning dust emission .",
    "these experiments are sensitive to very different angular scales and span a wide frequency range ( @xmath1 15 ghz to 40 ghz ) where a considerable contribution from spinning dust emission may be expected . the foreground templates are introduced in @xmath4 2 , the method is outlined in @xmath4 3 , the ovro foregrounds analysis is presented in @xmath4 4 , the sp94 foregrounds analysis is presented in @xmath4 5 , and @xmath4 6 consists of an overall discussion and conclusions .",
    "we use the 100 @xmath5 m template ( schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis 1998 ) as a tracer of emission from large dust grains which are in equilibrium with the interstellar medium and radiate thermally at temperatures around 20 k. the 60 and 12 @xmath5 m templates ( d. finkbeiner , private communication 2000 ) are used as tracers of emission from smaller dust grains that are transiently heated to higher temperatures and emit ( thermally at these high frequencies and rotationally at microwave frequencies ) to get back to their ground state . that the 12 @xmath5 m template is a clean tracer of emission from small dust grains and that such emission has a detectable counterpart at microwave frequencies",
    "is still being tested . even if the 12 @xmath5 m template is a clean tracer of the distribution of small dust grains",
    ", it may not be a good tracer of spinning dust emission at microwave frequencies which depends not only on the distribution of grains but on various other local factors .",
    "we proceed with these caveats in mind .",
    "it is thought that the distributions of small and large dust grains may be similar on large scales , but in some regions of the sky their small scale distribution could possibly differ ( weingartner and draine 2000 ) .",
    "thus , as noted by de oliveira - costa et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , shorter wavelength dust template maps might be expected to trace spinning dust at least as well as the 100 @xmath5 m map and possibly better on small scales .",
    "the templates are labelled i100 , i60 and i12 in the tables that follow .",
    "these templates are such that between 100 @xmath5 m and 60 @xmath5 m emission decreases over @xmath15 of the sky and between 60 @xmath5 m and 12 @xmath5 m the emission increases over @xmath16 of the sky . over all , between 100 @xmath5 m and 12 @xmath5",
    "m the emission increases over about @xmath17 of the sky at high galactic latitudes .",
    "emission from large dust grains is expected to drop to insignificant levels at 12 @xmath5 m . in spatial structure",
    "the 60 @xmath5 m template is very similar to the 100 @xmath5 m template over most parts of the sky .",
    "when cross - correlating the ovro data with dust templates , cross - correlating with the dust column density template ( a template of the amount of thermal dust emission expected if the dust were all at a reference temperature of 18 k , schlegel et al .",
    "1998 , and is labelled cdi100 in the tables ) is necessary in order to make the estimates of the correlation slope @xmath3 ( defined in @xmath4 3 ) comparable to those from the dmr data say , as the temperature in the ncp region , and especially in the ovro fields , is lower than the global average , resulting in lower dust emission and a correspondingly higher inferred correlation coefficient ( the factor is 2.7 for ovro , this was emphasized by finkbeiner & schlegel 1999 ) .",
    "table 1 lists the dust temperatures and intensities in the ovro fields , the whole of the ncp region ( dec @xmath18 ) , and the high galactic latitude sky ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the estimate from the saskatoon analysis may need to be revised similarly .",
    "note also that there is greater dust emission in the ovro fields and this can play an important role in heating diffuse ionized gas .",
    "the @xmath0 observations for the ovro region were carried out on october 4 , 2000 with the virginia tech spectral line imaging camera ( slic ) ( simonetti , dennison , & topasna 1996 ; dennison , topasna , & simonetti 1997 ) .",
    "the slic uses a 1.7 nm bandpass filter centered on @xmath0 and a dual bandpass continuum filter with narrow passbands on either side of the @xmath0 line .",

    "we obtained seven 6-minute @xmath0 images and six 3-minute continuum images approximately centered on the north celestial pole ( ncp ) .",
    "we also recorded ten continuum flat field images using a flat field light box described in simonetti et al .",
    "the images were combined and flat corrected in iraf using standard techniques ( dennison et al .",
    "1997 ) . for off - axis rays the bandpass of the interference filter shifts to longer wavelengths limiting the usable field to a 5-degree radius .",
    "the sensitivity to @xmath0 is quite flat over this field , but was radially corrected using @xmath0 observations of a flat @xmath0 light box . @xmath0",
    "calibration was achieved through repeated observations of the bright planetary nebula m76 , which we have previously determined to have an @xmath0 flux of @xmath22 ergs s@xmath23 @xmath24 .",
    "the @xmath0 image was then continuum - corrected through a weighted subtraction of the continuum image .",
    "this first required offsetting the continuum image by 1.93 pixels to achieve registration .",
    "( the different filters exhibit slightly different transverse gradients of optical thickness and thus displace the images by different amounts . ) the @xmath0 image was then smoothed by 0.5 pixel to match the resolution of the offset continuum image .",
    "the continuum - corrected image has significantly reduced stellar contamination , although the brightest stars are not well subtracted due to saturation effects .",
    "the @xmath0 line lies within a band of atmospheric oh emission , and because of the bandpass shift with incidence angle , our image contains contamination from the oh(6 - 1)@xmath25 line at 656.9 nm in the center of the image and the oh(6 - 1)@xmath26 line at 655.4 nm @xcite in the outer part .",
    "the latter emission is manifested as a faint ( @xmath27 r ) , diffuse ring with peak radius @xmath28 .",
    "an empirical model ring derived from azimuthally smoothed observations of a high - galactic - latitude field devoid of bright stars was used to remove the ring in the ncp field .",

    "some contamination remains outside of this range .",
    "the bright star , polaris , may also contribute to the contamination in the center of the image .",
    "a uniform gradient caused by scattered light as well as galactic starlight was also removed from the image .",
    "because the image contains an unknown , nearly uniform background due to geocoronal @xmath0 emission and scattered light , the median value of the final image was set equal to zero .",
    "coordinates were established using wcstools ( mink 1997 ) which was used to fit to stars from the hubble guide star catalog .",

    "in addition , for deriving the minimum variance estimator , we assume that the noise has zero mean and a gaussian distribution . would be biased . ] with such caveats in mind , this method has been widely used to test for the presence of contaminants in cmb anisotropy data .",

    ". however , the inferred foreground and the fitted foreground have similar spatial structure so it is possible that dust - correlated emission might satisfactorily explain all the foreground in the 14.5 ghz ovro data and the discrepancy might be due to uncertainties in the foreground template .",

    "if the dust - correlated emission were entirely spinning dust emission , then a stronger correlation with the higher frequency dust templates should be expected .",
    "the results from individual and joint template correlations demonstrate that this is not the case for the ovro 14.5 ghz data .",
    "the 12 @xmath5m - correlated emission is subdominant to the 100 @xmath5m - correlated emission in the 14.5 ghz ovro data , even though the two templates have similar spatial structure .",
    "this may happen if the 12 @xmath5 m template is a better tracer of spinning dust emission , and the 100 @xmath5 m template additionally traces free - free emission .",
    "the numbers in table 2 would then indicate that there are comparable amounts of the two components present in the ovro data at 14.5 ghz .",
    "more microwave data should be used to check this deduction , which is only tentative at present given the caveats discussed in the earlier section and the shortcomings and possibilities for systematic errors in this correlation method discussed in detail in mukherjee et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and mentioned in section @xmath4 3 .",
    "if however this deduction is true then the 14.5 ghz data are consistent with about @xmath67 @xmath5k rms of spinning dust emission and hence , using the 100 @xmath5m - correlated emission results for the 14.5 ghz data ( table 2 ) , with roughly @xmath68 @xmath5k rms of free - free emission at 14.5 ghz .",
    "this would translate into @xmath69 @xmath5k rms of free - free emission at 31.7 ghz .",
    "note , however , that the uncertainties in estimates of the correlation slope and the corresponding temperature fluctuations are comparable at the two frequencies .",
    "hence , since the dust - correlated foreground components are present only at low levels at 31.7 ghz the significances of the correlations are low as expected , becoming even lower when the data at this frequency are correlated with the 12 @xmath5 m and 100 @xmath5 m templates together .",
    "this makes it hard to ascertain which component dominates or even distinguish between two components at 31.7 ghz .",
    "however the estimated @xmath3 values do not contradict the above scenario , which would explain why the spectral index of the 100 @xmath5m - correlated emission , @xmath70 , is more skewed towards steeper values while being consistent with free - free , since the 100 @xmath5m - correlated emission at 14.5 ghz contains in it a 12 @xmath5 m correlated component as well , which itself has a spectral index of @xmath71 between the two frequencies , probably consistent with what is expected for spinning dust emission .",
    "when the @xmath0 data are convolved with the ovro beam and double differenced , the data have an rms of 0.83 r in the ovro fields . to find the visual extinction ( which results from a combination of scattering and absorption ) expected in the ovro fields , we use the reddening maps provided by schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and find that the average reddening in the 36 ovro fields is e(b - v ) = 0.297 mag , implying a high visual extinction of 0.921 mag ( using r(v ) = 3.1 ) . )",

    "this implies that the @xmath0 signal seen is at most @xmath74 or @xmath75 of the total @xmath0 signal , or that the total @xmath0 signal is 2.3 times that observed .",
    "this correction for extinction is not accurate as the decrease in the @xmath0 surface brightness in a given direction depends not only on the total column density of dust but also on the unknown arrangement of the emitting and absorbing material along the line of sight ( reynolds & haffner 2002 ) . without attempting to make a more accurate correction for extinction , 0.83 r",
    "would imply an estimated @xmath0 signal of 1.9 r and a free - free signal of @xmath76 @xmath5k rms at 14.5 ghz .",

    "we have repeated the analysis with this template and the results and conclusions presented here still hold . ]",
    "thus the upper limit on free - free emission inferred from @xmath0 data is less than the free - free like 100 @xmath5m - correlated signal found above , and is much less than the signal in the ovro data at 14.5 ghz that was found to have a spectral index like that of free - free emission pointed out at the beginning of this section .",
    "could there be a preferential heating of the wim , given that gas gets heated more easily than dust , due to the excess dust emission in this region , such that the @xmath0 data could be used to deduce a higher level of free - free emission in this region ?",

    "if the gas temperature here were higher by a factor of 2.3 , then the level of @xmath0 fluctuations expected can come down to 0.83 r. in order to explain the level of foreground in the ovro data .",
    "this is because they wanted to explain a free - free emission signal of 300 @xmath5k ( a factor of 3 larger from what is argued for here ) , they had not taken the high visual extinction in the ovro fields into account ( this causes a difference of a factor of 2.3 ) , and had an @xmath0 signal of rms @xmath78 @xmath79 ( factor of 4 lower at least from what is found here ) , giving in total a difference of a factor of 28 from that found here , which when multiplied by 4.2 leads to the factor @xmath80 . ]",

    "hamilton & ganga ( 2001 ) have reported the detection of 100 @xmath5m - correlated emission at 1.6 @xmath59 confidence in the @xmath84 band data , resulting in a possible reduction of the deduced cmb anisotropy band temperature of ganga et al .",
    "the @xmath83 band data was found to be free of contamination from this template .",
    "the sp94 cross - correlation analysis here is done ignoring the last 4 sp94 pixels that are close to and affected by a set of pixels at ra @xmath90 that have negative values of flux in the 12 @xmath5 m map , apparently due to inaccurate source subtraction at that location.m template .",
    "the pixels in the 12 @xmath5 m map that have negative flux values cause a dip in the signal in the last few pixels of the sp94 beam convolved template ( even when the negative flux values are set to 0 or to a value lower than the local mean , assuming that we can not really know the level of diffuse emission here due to the presence of a source that has not been accurately removed ) .",
    "there is a similar dip in the microwave signal in the different channels of the sp94 data ( see figure 2 ) , and this results in a strong correlation with the 12 @xmath5 m template . ]",
    "we show the results of correlating the data with the 100 @xmath5 m and the 12 @xmath5 m templates individually because when the data are correlated with these templates jointly , then due to the high correlation between the templates ( @xmath91 , see figure 2 ) , uncertainties increase further and nothing can be gained , given the already low level of contamination in this data .",
    "estimates of the correlation slope are derived by jointly correlating all channels of the @xmath92 band , the @xmath84 band and also all channels of both bands together , following hamilton & ganga ( 2001 ) .",
    "this is done because the anisotropy model covariance matrix causes non - trivial covariance between pixels of all channels .",
    "the noise in a given pixel is correlated with noise in the same pixel in other channels of the same band .",
    "the noise in the @xmath83 and @xmath84 bands are uncorrelated .",
    "we then combine the @xmath3 values obtained for each template into a representative ( average ) number ( @xmath93 ) using both a spectral index @xmath38 ( here @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is a reference frequency ) of 0 and the best fit @xmath38 , as described in hamilton & ganga ( 2001 ) , for the @xmath83 and @xmath84 bands separately and for both of them together . the best estimate of @xmath93 is obtained , in the case @xmath96 , from @xmath97 where total denotes the sum of all elements of a matrix or vector .",
    "this is thus a weighted average taking account of correlations between the @xmath3 values of the different channels .",
    "the best fit @xmath38 is obtained by minimizing , over a grid of values of @xmath38 , @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is a vector with elements @xmath100 .",
    "results are shown in the table 3 .",
    "we see that the @xmath83 band data does not correlate with the 100 @xmath5 m template while the @xmath84 band data correlates marginally , the best fit spectral index when both bands are considered together is positive , and there is a greater than 2 @xmath59 detection of 100 @xmath5m - correlated emission , in agreement with hamilton & ganga ( 2001 ) .",
    "regarding 12 @xmath5m - correlated emission , we again find that the @xmath83 band data does not correlate while the @xmath84 band data correlates marginally , the best fit spectral index when both bands are considered together is positive , and there is a greater than 2 @xmath59 detection of 12 @xmath5m - correlated emission when all channels are considered together with the best fit spectral index .",
    "the upper limit to the total contamination from dust templates in the sp94 data is @xmath101 @xmath5k when the results of all channels are combined using estimates of the best fit spectral indices .",
    "this is an upper limit because the 100 and the 12 @xmath5 m correlated emission have been coadded , even though these templates are seen to have similar structure ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "we are unable to say from this kind of a correlation analysis which of these two components is dominant or even whether these correlations are due to two physically distinct components .",
    "most of the contamination in the sp94 data is in its @xmath84 band ( total dust - correlated emission in this band is at most @xmath102 @xmath103 ) , as a consequence of which the deduced sp94 band temperature ( ganga et al . 1997 ) in the @xmath84 band could go down in amplitude by at most @xmath104 , to @xmath105 @xmath5k .",
    "no clear evidence is found for the contamination of @xmath83 band data .",
    "this is in agreement with the conclusions of ganga et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , also see ratra et al .",
    "( 1999b ) .",
    "sky - rotations ( correlating the data with template dust maps obtained by rotating the initial map around the galactic poles and by inverting the north and south poles ) indicate that the correlations are as significant as the numbers indicate . in other words",
    "the correlation that could arise from a random alignment between cmb anisotropies and the dust template has been taken into account in the analysis by the data and cmb covariance matrices , and the rms of the correlations from random patches agrees well with the error bars obtained by the correlation method .",
    "correlations similar to those obtained using the 100 @xmath5 m template are obtained when the data are correlated with the column density template for 100 @xmath5 m emission , indicating that the dust temperature in the sp94 pixels is not radically different from the average .",
    "the optical extinction in this region is also small .",
    "we analyze the structure of @xmath0 signal in the sp94 pixels using data from shassa .",
    "these data are available at a resolution of @xmath106 .",
    "no significant correlation is found when the sp94 data are correlated with the sp94 beam convolved @xmath0 data .",
    "when the sp94 data are correlated jointly with the 100 @xmath5 m and @xmath0 templates , a negative correlation is attributed to the @xmath0 template ( @xmath107 : @xmath96 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 , @xmath110 ) while a positive correlation is attributed to the 100 @xmath5 m template ( @xmath107 : @xmath96 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 , @xmath113 ) , of greater significance than that obtained when the data were correlated with this dust template individually .",
    "thus , like in the ovro case , we find that the structure in the @xmath0 template has something in common with structure of dust emission ( see figure 2 ) , and that in such a situation the correlation method is unable to separate any @xmath0-correlated signal from the rest of the dust - correlated signal .",
    "the correlation slope between the @xmath0 signal and the 100 @xmath5 m dust emission , for example for channel @xmath841 , is @xmath114 r(mjy / sr)@xmath23 ( @xmath17 of the rotated dust patches have greater correlation slope , @xmath115 of the dust patches correlated with greater significance ) . the correlation coefficient is @xmath116 ( the same @xmath115 of the dust patches had greater correlation coefficient than the real dust patch ) . here",
    "the variance is found by correlating the @xmath0 data with 144 rotated versions of the dust emission template . as in the case of ovro ,",
    "the @xmath0 and dust data correlate better after the chopping strategy of the sp94 experiment has been simulated on these data .",
    "more sensible deductions regarding any such association can be made by comparing the structure in these maps over larger areas of sky ( rather than in small 1d strips ) .",
    "consider the scenario in which dust - correlated emission consists of free - free emission as well as another component .",
    "the amplitude of dust - correlated emission in dmr data at 53 ghz is @xmath117 @xmath5k , while the total amount of free - free emission is @xmath118 @xmath5k using multifrequency data ( kogut et al .",
    "1996b ) . since at that time",
    "no other dust - correlated component of emission was expected to be found at these frequencies , it was concluded that the correlated component forms at least a third ( at @xmath119 confidence ) of the total free - free emission and possibly even the bulk of it .",
    "if instead free - free emission were only a part of the total dust - correlated emission ( with the 12 @xmath5 m and 100 @xmath5 m templates being similar in structure at large angular scales ) then the remaining part is constrained to be @xmath120 @xmath5k rms at 53 ghz on dmr scales .",
    "if this component is independent of angular scale , then this estimate together with the amplitude of 12 @xmath5m - correlated emission at 14.5 ghz ( ovro ) and 36 ghz ( sp94 ) implies a spectral index of @xmath121 between 14.5 ghz and 53 ghz and @xmath122 between 36 ghz and 53 ghz ( between 14.5 ghz and 31.7 ghz @xmath123 as discussed in @xmath4 4 ) .",
    "these spectral index estimates may be consistent with the spinning dust hypothesis , becoming more negative at higher frequencies , although the uncertainties in the estimates are significant .",
    "for free - free emission , if we use the power spectrum estimated by veeraraghavan & davies ( 1997 ) , @xmath124 ( they estimated the power spectrum directly from cleaned and destriped @xmath0 maps and so may have obtained a more reliable estimate of the free - free emission power spectrum than did kogut et al .",
    "1996a ) , and predict the level of free - free emission that the ovro 14.5 ghz and the sp94 36 ghz experiments should see at their respective angular scales given the average estimate of cobe dmr , we get @xmath125 @xmath5k rms and @xmath126 @xmath5k rms for ovro and sp94 respectively .",
    "this implies free - free emission of @xmath127 @xmath5k rms at @xmath119 confidence in the 14.5 ghz ovro data , consistent with the rough upper limits indicated by @xmath0 observations , though the emission in smaller regions could deviate significantly from this average .",
    "we see that it is plausible that the 100 @xmath5 m template , at least in some regions of the sky , traces free - free emission , as well as the structure in the 12 @xmath5 m template by virtue of the large and small grains being well mixed .",
    "if it is generally true that the 100 @xmath5 m template correlations are in part free - free , the remaining being another component that the 12 @xmath5 m template traces better ( this may hold only in regions of the sky where large and small dust grains are well mixed , also our analysis throughout assumes that the emission from these grains are well traced by the templates we use which are thus close to perfect as discussed ) , this hypothesis would explain why veeraraghavan & davies ( 1997 ) obtain a considerably lower normalization for the free - free emission power spectrum derived from @xmath0 maps than did kogut et al .",
    "( 1996a ) , who used dust - correlated microwave emission ( which is only in part free - free emission ) .",
    "it would also explain the flatter spectrum of free - free emission that they obtained given that the remaining dust - correlated emission makes a contribution to temperature fluctuations that seems to be independent of angular scale , from the estimates available to date .",
    "figure 3@xmath3 is a plot of 100 @xmath5m - correlated emission found in microwave data so far .",
    "it is similar to fig 4 . of hamilton & ganga ( 2001 ) with the corrected ovro points with error bars added .",
    "spectrally the data do not seem to favour either of the spinning dust or free - free interpretations .",
    "note that the set of tenerife points taken from de oliveira - costa et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , for the region @xmath128 no longer show a rising spectrum , the key signature of spinning dust emission , between 10 and 15 ghz ( though they did find that microwave-@xmath0 correlations were too small to explain the microwave - ir correlations in the data ) .",
    "the points taken from mukherjee et al .",
    "( 2001 ) are higher because there it was shown that only pixels close to the galactic plane actually show dust - correlated emission and here the estimated @xmath3 is higher . for such reasons comparisons between experiments",
    "must be made with caution .",
    "figure 3@xmath129 is a plot of 12 @xmath5m - correlated emission in microwave data .",
    "the tenerife points ( taken from de oliveira - costa et al .",
    "2002 ) could go up if the estimate is confined to the limited region that shows dust - correlated emission at both frequencies ( mukherjee et al .",
    "the figure indicates that spinning dust emission might have been detected in microwave data with significant levels of emission at about 15 ghz .",
    "we however need to check for example whether the correlation slope between the 12 @xmath5 m template and dmr data lies on the spectral curve shown . in order to correlate the dmr data with the 12 @xmath5 m template",
    "we may need to await the cleaning of the template as the signal at 12 @xmath5 m is contaminated significantly by zodiacal emission .",
    "modelling zodiacal emission is a complex task and this could take some time .",
    "we were able use the 12 @xmath5 m template in its present state as we consider only small regions of the sky , and in these few pixels far from the ecliptic plane there does not seem to be obvious contamination .",
    "so , whether the 12 @xmath5m - correlated emission in other cmb anisotropy data sets follow the spectral pattern of this figure remains to be determined .",
    "higher quality data from the newer cmb experiments , such as cbi and dasi , and that anticipated from map , should help resolve this issue .    rather than having to use thermal dust emission as an indirect tracer of free - free emission ,",
    "data from new @xmath0 observations are expected to provide a template that more directly traces free - free emission . however , converting the @xmath0 data into a reliable template of free - free emission may require some care . a careful comparison of structures in a high resolution @xmath0 map , with information on extinction and gas temperatures ( say from x - ray and ultraviolet observations ) , to structures in microwave and ir data over larger areas of sky is needed to better understand the relevant associations . the spinning dust hypothesis itself is being studied by making pointed observations towards dust features predicted to emit significant amounts of spinning dust emission ( finkbeiner et al .",
    "such observations can more easily and significantly constrain the spinning dust model . even if these foreground contaminants are present only at low levels in cmb anisotropy data ,",
    "it is important that they be understood and removed to high precision , especially if one wishes to study higher order statistics and non - gaussian signatures in the cmb anisotropy data ( see , e.g. , park et al . 1998 , 2001 ; chiang & coles 2000 ; barreiro & hobson 2001 ; wu et al .",
    "2001 ; park , park , & ratra 2002 , shandarin et al .",
    "2002 ) .    in summary",
    ", we discuss a scenario in which 100 @xmath5m - correlated microwave emission in the ovro and sp94 microwave anisotropy data sets consists of free - free emission as well as another component .",
    "this is motivated by the facts that free - free emission by itself is not expected to result in strong microwave - ir correlations , free - free emission is constrained by @xmath0 emission in both the data sets to be less that the amplitude of dust - correlated emission , and that the 100 @xmath5m - correlated emission dominates over the 12 @xmath5m - correlated emission in the ovro 14.5 ghz data .",
    "the @xmath0 data and dust emission data seem to have some common structure , but dust emission correlates better with microwave data .",
    "if we use the power spectrum of veeraraghavan & davies ( 1997 ) for free - free emission and assume that the other component is independent of angular scale , as observations to date seem to roughly indicate , or if we use the 12 @xmath5 m template as a tracer of this component , then we find that from spectral index considerations this component could be spinning dust emission .",
    "other cmb data sets would have to be studied to confirm this .",
    "given that the two components may have different power spectra , which component dominates in a given data set would depend on both the frequency as well as the relevant angular scales .",
    "higher quality cmb anisotropy data , more knowledge about the characteristics of dust emission at high frequencies and at microwave frequencies , and high resolution @xmath0 data over large portions of the sky , will all be valuable in obtaining a clearer picture of foreground contaminants in low frequency microwave data .",

    "<S> we study galactic emission foreground contamination of the ovro and ucsb south pole 1994 cosmic microwave background anisotropy data by cross - correlating with templates of infrared dust emission and new high resolution vtss and shassa @xmath0 data . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 data provide rough upper limits on the level of free - free emission in the data sets . </S>",
    "<S> the cross - correlation analysis does not contradict a two component foreground emission hypothesis , with the two dust - correlated components being free - free emission and spinning dust emission . </S>"
