    "3 we consider the extension of the notion of point particles in space  time to non  abelian cs particles ( [ 811 ] with space  time points supplemented by internal charge coordinates @xmath20 , constrained by ( 1.6 ) .",
    "the non  abelian gauge sector is described by the cs action ( 1.4 ) .",
    "we find that , after quantization , the energy levels of the two  body problem depend on the eigenvalues of the following isospin - like operator @xmath35 where @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",

    "we describe two  body quantum mechanics and present numerical results for the corresponding modification of the energy spectra in the confined regime for both the abelian and the non - abelian case .",
    "5 presents some outlook .",
    "we consider the following action of @xmath46 nonrelativistic charged particles interacting with dreibein fields @xmath47 and an electromagnetic field @xmath11 :    @xmath48    where @xmath49 is the electric charge of the @xmath50th particle . under the assumption that the fields @xmath51 transform covariantly under fixed time diffeomorphism @xmath52 is an invariant entity .",
    "the full action is given now by    @xmath53    the equation of motion ( eom ) , the gauss constraint for the dreibeins @xmath1 derived from ( 2.2 ) and their solution are described in [ 1,12 ] .",
    "we have @xmath54 with    @xmath55    @xmath56    where the singular gauge function @xmath57 is defined by @xmath58 and regularized in such a way that @xmath59 vanishes for @xmath60 .",
    "variation of @xmath61 with respect to @xmath62 leads to the constraint @xmath63 and therefore to the vanishing of the total momentum of the @xmath46particle system [ 1,12 ] .",
    "the choice of gauge ( 2.45 ) for the dreibeins breaks asymptotically the invariance with respect to local space translations leaving , as residual symmetry [ 1,12 ] , only translations local in time , and rigid rotations .",
    "the eom and the gauss constraint for the @xmath11 , and their solutions , are all well known ( cp .",
    "we have @xmath64 let us consider now the two  body case i.e. @xmath65 in detail .",
    "applying the legendre transformation to the lagrangian ( 2.2 ) and using the relevant constraints ( gauss and ( 2.7 ) ) we obtain for the two  body hamiltonian @xmath66 describing relative motion @xmath67 where we have defined    @xmath68    denoting the canonical particle momenta by @xmath69 and defining @xmath70 we obtain from ( 1.2 ) , ( 2.1 ) , ( 2.35 ) and ( 2.89 ) the relation    @xmath71 squaring it and using again ( 2.9 ) we obtain @xmath72 where the angular momentum for the relative motion @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) is , according to ( 2.10 ) , given by @xmath75 with @xmath76    note that ( 2.11 ) has the same form in case of absence of the abelian gauge fields [ 1,12 ] , only the relation ( 2.12 ) gets an additional term .    by applying an inverse legendre transformation to ( 2.9 ) and using ( 2.10 )",
    "we obtain the well known result that the coupling to the abelian gauge fields leads only to the addition of a total time derivative to the two  particle lagrangian @xmath77 therefore the classical eom are unchanged in comparison with @xmath78 case [ 1,12 ] . due to the singular nature of @xmath79",
    "this holds for noncoinciding particle positions , i.e. for @xmath80 only .",

    "we now consider the interaction of @xmath46 nonrelativistic particles carrying @xmath28charges @xmath24 ( @xmath86 ) with dreibein fields @xmath87 and @xmath28gauge fields @xmath88 .",
    "the corresponding particle action @xmath52 is given by @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the action which is given by the symplectic form ( 1.7 ) [ 9 ] .",
    "choosing on the sphere @xmath25 the spherical coordinates one gets @xmath91 with @xmath92 being the angles on the sphere @xmath25 .",
    "the total action is now given by ( see ( 1.1 ) , ( 1.4 ) and ( 3.1 - 2 ) ) @xmath93 as again , the gauge and gravitational degrees of freedom are not coupled directly and , as in the abelian case , the dreibeins are described by ( 2.35 ) .",

    "body dynamics we need only the @xmath99 at the particle positions @xmath100 .",
    "fortunately , at these positions , the solution of ( 3.4 ) may be obtained explicitly [ 16 ] in the following form :    @xmath101 in order to make the arguments given in [ 16 ] rigorous we introduce a gauge field @xmath102 @xmath103 solving the linearized gauss constraint ( 3.4 ) .    at the points",
    "@xmath100 the potentials @xmath104 coincide with the expressions given in ( 3.7a  b ) , because the regularization of @xmath105 leads to the vanishing of the self interaction terms in ( 3.7c ) .",
    "furthermore the nonlinear term in the definition of @xmath106 ( see in ( 3.6 ) ) vanishes at @xmath100 , what completes the proof .",
    "the relation ( 3.5 ) will not be discussed further as @xmath107 is not needed in the following .    by the same procedure",
    "as described in section 2 we may now derive the expressions for the two  body hamiltonian @xmath66 and the canonical momentum for the relative particle motion @xmath108 .",
    "we obtain @xmath109 and @xmath110 note that ( 3.8 ) and ( 3.9 ) are the same as ( 2.9 ) and ( 2.10 ) respectively with the electric charges @xmath111 replaced by their @xmath28 counterparts .",
    "therefore , we obtain by squaring ( 3.9 ) again @xmath72 with @xmath112 where @xmath73 and @xmath83 are defined as before .",
    "finally , we have to show that @xmath113 is a conserved quantity,_i.e . _",
    "@xmath114 in order to prove this statement we start with the non ",
    "abelian counterpart to ( 2.14 ) given by @xmath115 then the euler ",
    "lagrange equations for @xmath116 are the wong ",
    "equations [ 10,11 ] which take the form @xmath117 by exchanging the particle indices 1 and 2 we get @xmath118 note that ( 3.14 - 15 ) imply that the lengths of @xmath119 are conserved .",
    "thus we conclude that @xmath120 which , due to ( 1.8 ) , leads to the desired result ( 3.12 ) . with ( 3.12 )",
    "we conclude from ( 3.13 ) that the formulae ( 2.1517 ) hold as in the non  abelian case .",
    "let us start with the observation that we have , in both the abelian and non  abelian cases , the same structure of the classical two  body hamiltonian    @xmath72    with    @xmath121    with @xmath122 , a function of the particle charges , given by    @xmath123    without the gauge fields we have @xmath124 .",
    "therefore , in quantizing ( 4.12 ) we can follow the techniques presented in [ 1,12 ] .",
    "however , we should keep in mind that the quantum theory requires a quantized coupling @xmath125 in the non  abelian case [ 8,17 ] @xmath126 moreover , we have to properly take into account , the quantum nature of the operator @xmath127 .",
    "8.7 in we quantize the problem by considering a schrdinger - like equation @xmath128 \\psi(\\vec{x},t ) \\label{eq6}\\ ] ] in which the operators @xmath129 and @xmath130 are defined by the usual quantization rules @xmath131    note that , in the non - abelian case , the eigenvalues of @xmath127 ( see ( 1.8 ) ) are determined by @xmath132 and so the wavefunction @xmath133 depends also on the eigenvalues @xmath134 , @xmath135 and @xmath43 .",
    "more explicitly , the wave function in ( 4.5 ) , for two non - abelian cs particles with definite quantized isospins @xmath134 and @xmath135 describes a multiplet of wave functions with @xmath136 components , where @xmath137 .",
    "this multiplet structure and the eigenvalues of @xmath127 given by ( 4.7 ) will be implicitly assumed in all formulae that follow .    for the stationary case , _",
    "i.e. _ when @xmath138 we can use the angular - momentum basis and put @xmath139 where @xmath140 is an integer , and find that @xmath141 satisfies a nonstandard time independent schrdinger equation @xmath142f_{e , m}(r ) = 0 , \\label{sch}\\ ] ] where , in consistency with ( 4.2 ) , we have defined @xmath143 _ i.e. _ @xmath144 is an eigenvalue of @xmath145 and @xmath122 denotes the eigenvalue of @xmath127 .",
    "we see that our equation ( 4.9 ) is the same as the equation ( 7.6 ) of [ 12 ] with an important difference due to @xmath122 .",
    "the existence of @xmath122 leads not only to the redefinition of @xmath146 but , in the non - abelian case , also to the splitting of the energy levels as for any integer or half - interger values of @xmath134 and @xmath135 there are several values of @xmath43 which satisfy @xmath147 . to determine the energy levels , we can , however , follow the procedure used in [ 12 ] . thus",
    ", in particular , if we focus our attention on the interior solutions ( @xmath148 ) we find that they are given by @xmath149 ( restricting our attention to the more interesting case of @xmath150 )    the energy levels are then given by the eigenvalues of @xmath66 , which are determined by the boundary condition corresponding to the requirement that the wavefunction vanishes at @xmath151 , and are given by :    @xmath152\\,=\\,0 \\label{result}\\ ] ]    with @xmath146 given by ( [ bar ] ) .",
    "let us look at the case @xmath153 , @xmath154 .",
    "then it is convenient to define @xmath155 so that ( [ result ] ) takes the form @xmath156    the bessel function @xmath157 , for fixed @xmath158 , has an infinite number of positive zeroes which , in what follows , we denote by @xmath159 , @xmath160 thus we see that due to ( [ bar ] ) , the eigenvalues @xmath161 are the positive fixed points of the equation @xmath162 where @xmath163    the existence of positive fixed points @xmath164 of ( [ neweq ] ) was discussed in great detail in [ 12 ] , both by using various asymptotic formulae for the zeroes of bessel s functions and also by solving ( [ neweq ] ) numerically . as the present case differs from the case without the gauge functions by the redefinition of @xmath146 , below we present the figure from",
    "[ 12 ] , but this time with the interpretation that the horizontal axis denotes not @xmath140 but @xmath165 .",
    "the plot looks like several curves ; the lowest values correspond to the first zeroes ( _ ie _ @xmath166 ) , the next ones to second zeroes _ ie _ @xmath167 _ etc_. the points lie so close that the figure may appear as a set of lines while , in reality , we have here sets of points . the points appear to be ( almost ) equally spaced on each  curve \" - this is due to the approximate linearity of the positions of zeros of bessel functions as a function of @xmath146 . to check our values of energies we had also solved ( [ neweq ] ) differently ; we approximated the positions of the zeroes of the bessel functions by a linear function and solved the resultant equations for @xmath164 .",
    "the obtained results were very similar to those of our figure thus giving us confidence in our results .",
    "our results show that , for each value of @xmath140 and so for each value of @xmath168 , there is a whole tower of values of @xmath164 corresponding to different zeroes of the bessel functions .",
    "in addition , in the non - abelian case , there is a further splitting of energy levels due to the different values of @xmath43 in @xmath122 .",
    "the values of @xmath164 increase , approximately linearly , as we take higher zeros ( _ ie _",
    "@xmath169 for larger @xmath136 ) .",
    "the dependence on @xmath140 is only slightly more complicated ; for each order of the zero there is a value of @xmath140 for which the energy is minimal and as we move away from this value the energy grows , approximately , linearly .",
    "as @xmath136 increases the minimal values of @xmath140 increase , again , approximately linearly .",
    "( 12,12 )    note that for @xmath170 and @xmath171 the corresponding energy levels are obtained by changing the sign of @xmath140 and @xmath122 .",
    "we summarise our results by noting that in the interior region @xmath148 , where classical solutions are only possible for a finite time interval , we can find quantum solutions which correspond to discrete bound states determined by the boundary condition at @xmath151 .",
    "this shows that as in the case discussed in [ 12 ] this boundary condition defines a sort of planar geometric  bag \" for the quantum state .",
    "the discussion of the exterior solutions is again similar to what we presented in [ 12 ] .",
    "the system has no bound states and the scattering solutions are given by a superposition of bessel functions of the first and second kind    @xmath172    with the ratio @xmath173 determined by the boundary condition of the wavefunction vanishing at @xmath151 .",
