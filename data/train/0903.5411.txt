    "ngc  1275 ( henceforth perseus  a , abbreviated per  a ) is the central dominant cd ( giant elliptical ) galaxy in the perseus cluster .",
    "it is one of the most intriguing and intensively scrutinized galaxies in the sky .",
    "@xcite found two sets of optical emission lines separated by @xmath0@xmath7 towards per  a , and proposed that per  a is colliding with a forergound infalling galaxy .",
    "a photograph in the h@xmath1 line taken by @xcite revealed a spectacular flamentary nebula centered on per  a and extending up to @xmath0140  ( @xmath050  kpc ) from its center .",
    "a modern ccd image reveals that the h@xmath1 nebula has a bright inner region extending east - west , together with a multitude of mostly radial ( but also some transverse ) filaments that extends furthest in the north - south direction reaching @xmath070  kpc north of center @xcite",
    ". per  a was the first central cd galaxy in a rich cluster found to contain cool ( @xmath8100  k ) molecular gas as traced in co @xcite .",
    "single - dish maps show that the main body of the cool molecular gas has an overall morphology similar to the bright inner region of the h@xmath1 nebula @xcite .",
    "cool molecular gas also has been detected towards the outer h@xmath1 filaments where observed @xcite .",
    "both hot ( @xmath02000  k ) ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) and warm ( @xmath0300400  k ) @xcite molecular hydrogen gas has been found towards all regions of the h@xmath1 nebula so far observed ( bright inner region and outer filaments ) .",
    "the coolest detectable component of the x - ray emitting gas in the perseus cluster , at a temperature of @xmath0@xmath9  k , has a morphology similar to the h@xmath1 nebula @xcite .",
    "the nature ( origin and excitation ) of the multi - phase nebula associated with per  a is poorly understood . because the cool molecular gas traced in co dominates by far the mass of this nebula , a detailed understanding of its properties is of particular importance .",
    "the main body of this cool molecular gas has been traced by single - dish telescopes out to @xmath014  kpc east and west of center , and has a mass of @xmath0@xmath10 ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "these single - dish observations at spatial resolutions of several kiloparsecs show no overall pattern in the gas kinematics , which is slightly redshifted at the nucleus and ( mostly ) more strongly blueshifted east and west of center .",
    "our ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper  i ) interferometric observations at a spatial resolution of @xmath01  kpc covering the central region of radius @xmath010  kpc revealed three radial filaments lying approximately east - west , together with a number of other mostly unresolved features . as a whole",
    ", these features show no overall pattern in their kinematics ; in particular , there is no bulk velocity gradient in the east - west ( or any other ) direction indicative of gas orbiting per  a , as would be expected for material captured from a gas rich - galaxy .",
    "instead , we found that each filament exhibits its own particular kinematic pattern .",
    "the outermost filaments east and west of center both exhibit linearly increasing blueshifted velocities with decreasing radii , but with different velocity gradients .",
    "we were able to reproduce their observed spatial - kinematic structures as free - fall in the gravitational potential of per  a , as would be naturally expected for cool gas deposited by a x - ray cooling flow .    here ,",
    "we report follow - up interferometric co observations that extend our coverage in the east - west direction to span the entire main body of the cool molecular gas mapped with single - dish telescopes .",
    "we describe our observations and data reduction in @xmath11 .",
    "the results are presented in @xmath12 , where we show that all but one of the detected co features is spatially resolved into radial filaments ; at least six distinct filaments can be clearly identified in our maps . in @xmath13",
    ", we examine the relationship between the cool molecular filaments and the h@xmath1 nebula , and show that there is a correlation between the co and h@xmath1 luminosity of all these filaments ; on the other hand , we show that a number of at least equally luminous h@xmath1 features exhibit no detectable co with upper limits that deviate strongly from the derived correlation .",
    "we then demonstrate that all the filaments are gravitationally bound , and explore why they do not appear to be collapsing to vigorously form stars . finally , as a guide for future interferometric observations , we identify regions where our interferometric measurements have not recovered all the single - dish emission . in @xmath14 , we provide a concise summary of our observations and interpretation .",
    "we assume as in paper  i that per  a lies at a distance of @xmath074  mpc ( redshift @xmath15 , and adopting @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) , so that @xmath18 .",
    "we observed per  a on 2006 december 17 using the sub - millimeter array ( sma ) as in our previous observation ( paper  i ) .",
    "the weather was good , with a zenith sky opacity at 225  ghz ( @xmath19 ) in the range @xmath00.050.1 as measured at the adjacent caltech submillimeter observatory .",
    "the sma was in its compact configuration , and with six of its eight 6-m antennas operating provided fifteen baselines ranging from about 10  m to 70  m. the dual - sideband receivers operating in the 230  ghz ( 1.3  mm ) band were tuned to a central observing frequency of 216.35  ghz in the lower sideband , and 226.34  ghz in the upper sideband to place the co(21 ) line in this sideband . at the frequency of the co(21 ) line , the primary beam of the telescope as measured at full width half maximum ( fwhm ) is @xmath055 , which corresponds to @xmath020  kpc in the assumed cosmology .",
    "the correlator was configured to cover 24 spectral windows ( chunks in the sma nomenclature ) with 128 channels in each chunk .",
    "this provided a spectral resolution of 0.81  mhz ( @xmath0@xmath20 ) over a total bandwidth , with some overlap at the edges of adjacent chucks , of 1.98  ghz ( @xmath0@xmath21 ) .",
    "the system temperature ranged from 80  k to 170  k , changing in time with the source elevation .",
    "we began by observing neptune and uranus for 20 minutes each to serve as alternate choices for absolute flux and antenna passband calibration .",
    "we then observed per  a over a duration of @xmath09  hrs , interrupted only once for an antenna pointing check .",
    "our previous observation ( paper  i ) had shown that the co(2 - 1 ) features detected spanned from center to ( near ) the edge of the primary beam in the east - west directions . to provide better sensitivity to the outer eastern and western features , and to search for more gas beyond the field of view of our previous observation , we employed a three - point mosaic with one field centered on the nucleus and the other two centered approximately on the eastern and western filaments respectively as illustrated in figure  [ 3pointing ] .",
    "we pointed the telescope alternately between these three positions , and in each cycle integrated for six 30-s samples on the central position and ten 30-s samples on each of the eastern and western positions .",
    "more details of the observations can be found in table  [ pointing ] . finally , we observed saturn for 55  min to serve as another alternative for passband calibration .",
    "saturn was so bright , however , that it partially saturated the receivers , thus preventing its use as a passband calibrator .",
    "we performed our data reduction using sma - specific mir tasks in idl adopted for the sma from the mma software package developed originally for ovro @xcite .",
    "because absorption by the earth s atmosphere introduces an elevation - dependent attenuation of astronomical signals , we first corrected for this effect by weighting the amplitude of each visibility by the inverse product of the system temperatures of the corresponding antenna pair as measured in each 30-s integration . in our observation , both uranus and neptune were resolved on the longer baselines ; because the measured amplitude of uranus was higher than that of neptune on all baselines , we used uranus for both absolute flux and passband calibration .",
    "we derived complex gain ( i.e. , amplitude and phase ) solutions from the unresolved nuclear continuum emission of per  a when the telescope was pointed at the central position , and then interpolated these solutions to measurements when the telescope was pointed at the eastern and western positions . because of significant baseline - based errors in some chunks , we adopted baseline - based solutions for both passband and gain calibration .",
    "this also helped address significant pointing errors on some of the antennas , an issue we will return to later .",
    "mapping of the co(21 ) emission towards per  a requires stable antenna passbands to avoid artifacts that would otherwise be produced by its strong nuclear continuum source ( see discussion in paper  i ) .",
    "this source had a measured flux density of 3.5  jy during our observation , compared with 3.4  jy measured in our previous observation ( paper  i ) . in channel maps of the central pointing made before continuum subtraction",
    ", we found that the nuclear continuum source exhibits a slow and weak variation in intensity with frequency , reflecting small changes in the individual antenna passbands with time .",
    "the peak - to - peak variation in the nuclear continuum intensity with frequency is @xmath0@xmath22 .",
    "this led to an imperfect subtraction of the nuclear continuum source in our co(21 ) channel maps , leaving artifacts as strong as about @xmath2350  mjy at the nuclear position for the central pointing . for comparison , the root - mean - square ( rms ) noise level ( @xmath24 ) of the channel maps at a velocity resolution of @xmath0@xmath25",
    "is @xmath030  mjy for the central pointing ( table  [ pointing ] ) .",
    "hence , artifacts at the nuclear position are no stronger than about @xmath232@xmath24 in these maps . in channel maps of the eastern and western pointings where the nuclear continuum source lies close to the edge of the primary beam and",
    "is therefore strongly attenuated , artifacts at the nuclear position caused by passband variations is correspondingly less severe .    to make the final clean maps , the dirty beam , corresponding to the point spread function ( psf ) of the telescope as computed from the known positions of the antennas relative to the source , must be deconvolved from the dirty maps ( where each pixel is convolved with the telescope psf ) to remove the sidelobe response of the telescope .",
    "variations in antenna passbands , along with imperfect complex gain calibration , can leave artifacts related to imperfect deconvolution of sidelobes from both continuum and line emission . although difficult to quantify , artifacts produced by sidelobes can often be recognized by their resemblance to the known sidelobe pattern .",
    "in addition , maps made in our previous observation ( paper  1 ) could be compared with those made here as an independent check . in this way",
    ", we were able to identify artifacts lying north - south in our previous map , and confirm as genuine all the features lying east - west .",
    "for the eastern and western pointings , the nuclear continuum source of per  a lies close to the edge of the primary beam .",
    "any pointing errors in the individual antennas ( along the radial direction ) therefore causes a much larger variation in the measured intensity of the nuclear continuum source for these pointings compared with the central pointing .",
    "indeed , we found that the measured intensity of the nuclear continuum source changed with time by up to a factor of @xmath01.3 larger in both the eastern and western pointings than in the central pointing , indicating significant antenna pointing errors . by comparing the amplitudes of the nuclear continuum source measured in each of the three pointings against their expected amplitudes",
    ", we estimated pointing errors of about 515  depending on the given antenna .",
    "such antenna pointing errors lead to an inaccurate correction for the primary beam response of the antennas that becomes increasingly worse for features closer to the edge of the primary beam . to estimate the magnitude of these errors ,",
    "we compared the measured intensity of the nuclear continuum source from maps ( corrected for the primary beam response ) made of adjacent pointings ; we also compared , after continuum subtraction , the measured integrated intensity of co(21 ) features in regions of the map ( corrected for the primary beam response ) where adjacent pointings overlap .",
    "we found that the intensity of both the continuum source and common co(21 ) features to differ by less than @xmath0@xmath26 between adjacent pointings , indicating that the antenna pointing errors are more or less random in the sky . in the co(2 - 1 ) channel maps at a velocity resolution of @xmath0@xmath25 , 10@xmath27 variations in the intensity of individual features correspond to less than the rms noise fluctuations .",
    "antenna pointing errors , just like errors in passband and complex gain calibration , also can leave artifacts related to imperfect deconvolution of sidelobes from both continuum and line emission . in this respect ,",
    "antenna pointing errors are probably more important than those related to variations in antenna passbands and imperfect complex gain calibration for , especially , the eastern and western pointings .    to make co(21 ) channel maps , we first subtracted the nuclear continuum source in the visibility plane derived from a fit to the line - free channels in the upper sideband . for the reader to judge the reliability of our maps ,",
    "we have made separate channel maps for the three individual pointings at a velocity resolution of @xmath25 , and derived from these channel maps separate integrated intensity ( zeroth moment ) and intensity - weighted mean - velocity ( first moment ) maps corrected for the primary beam response .",
    "we also made a mosaic map utilizing all the data from the three separate pointings , along with data taken in the previous observation ( paper  i ) , with the appropriate correction for the primary beam response in each pointing .",
    "the corresponding angular resolutions and rms noise of the mosaic and combined maps are listed in table  [ pointing ] .",
    "all the maps shown in this manuscript , unless otherwise mentioned , were made with natural weighting of the data to maximize the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio .",
    "only one of the maps shown was made using uniform weighting , useful for inspecting the detected features at the highest attainable angular resolution .",
    "we have discovered a small error in our subtraction of the nuclear continuum source in paper  i. when deriving its flux density , we inadvertently included line - containing along with line - free channels in our fit : this resulted in a slight overestimate of the flux density of the nuclear continuum source , and therefore an oversubtraction of the continuum source in our channel maps .",
    "this error can be seen most clearly in the spectra of the individual filaments shown in figure  3 of paper  i , especially for the inner and western filaments ( i.e. , those closest to the nucleus ) where the spectral baseline is consistently below zero by a few tens of mjy . after correcting this mistake",
    ", the moment map made , shown in figure  [ 3pointing ] , does not show any qualitative changes .",
    "as in paper  i , to make moment maps we first convolved the channel maps with a triangular function ( i.e. , hanning smoothing ) that best recovers the overall features in that particular map .",
    "we then discarded individual pixels in the original channel maps with intensities less than a certain theshold ( typically @xmath01.52.0@xmath24 ) in their corresponding hanning - smoothed channel maps .",
    "we summed the remaining data in the channel maps ( with no smoothing ) to produce the integrated intensity map , and computed the mean velocity of each pixel weighted by its intensity in each channel to produce the intensity - weighted mean - velocity map .",
    "figure  [ new_mom ] shows moment maps of the central , eastern , and western pointings separately . in each case , the integrated co(21 ) intensity , corrected for the primary beam response , is plotted in contours on the intensity - weighted co(21 ) mean velocity in color .",
    "all of the features seen in our previous observation ( comprising a single pointing centered on the nucleus ) except for n1 , s1 , and w1 ( fig .  2 in paper  i ; see also fig .  1 of this paper )",
    "are seen in at least one ( typically two , if not all three ) of the individual pointings in our present observation .",
    "s1 , if real , should have been detectable in the moment maps of both the central and western pointings . on the other hand , n1 and w1 ,",
    "if real , would lie below the cutoff threshold imposed on the moment maps for both the central and western pointings .",
    "when we lowered the cutoff threshold for making the moment maps shown in figure  [ new_mom ] , we found that w1 but not n1 nor s1 could be seen in both the central ( along with e1 ) and western pointings .",
    "thus , w1 is real , but as shown explicitly in @xmath28 both n1 and s1 are artifacts related to sidelobes .    the inner filament is detected in all three pointings . the western filament is detected in both the central and , at a higher s / n ratio , western pointings . the eastern filament is detected in the eastern pointing , and only its outermost tip in the central pointing .",
    "e1 is detected only in the eastern pointing , but e2 is detected in both the central and eastern pointings .",
    "apart from these features , all of which were previously detected in paper  i , we do not detect any new features in the maps of figure  [ new_mom ] that we can confidently regard as real .",
    "we have combined all the data taken in our present observation with that taken in paper  i ( comprising only a single pointing centered on the nucleus ) to make the most sensitive mosaic map possible .",
    "figure  [ channel - maps ] shows the resulting co(21 ) channel maps for the inner@xmath29western regions ( upper panel ) and the eastern region ( lower panel ) separately .",
    "figure  [ mom - all ] shows the corresponding moment map , where the dotted line indicates where the noise level has increased by a factor of 2 from center . although extending the region mapped from a central radius of @xmath010  kpc to a radial extent of @xmath014  kpc in both the eastern and western directions to cover the entire main body of molecular gas in per  a , we did not detect any new features beyond the region previously mapped in paper  i. in the moment map of figure  [ mom - all ] , we have masked out the artifact labeled n1 in our previous observation ( see @xmath28 ) ; the artifact s1 , which we found to be substantially reduced in the maps made from all the data combined , is not detected at the cutoff threshold imposed .",
    "( we note , for completeness , that noise peaks outside the area occupied by the dotted line have been masked . ) compared with our previous observation , the western filament appears to exhibit a more pronounced bend towards the south about halfway along its length . as shown in greater detail later in @xmath30 , this apparent bend is caused by a separate feature labeled w2 ( not discernible as a separate feature in paper  i despite the improved continuum subtraction ; fig .  [ 3pointing ] )",
    "detected here for the first time ( at the improved sensitivity ) located just to the south of the western filament about halfway along its length .    in figure  [ uniform - weighting ] , we show moment maps of the features e1 , e2 , and w1 made with uniform weighting to provide a higher angular resolution . the arrows in each panel point to the center of per  a. all these features , like the three previously identified filaments ,",
    "can now be seen to comprise radial filaments ( as discussed in more detail below ) .",
    "@xcite have observed the eastern filament , e1 , and e2 at significantly higher sensitivity and comparable ( marginally higher ) angular resolution with the iram  pdbi .",
    "their maps also show that e1 and e2 are radial filaments .    in table",
    "[ gas_mass ] , we tabulate the properties of each filament ( with limited information for w2 , which is spatially unresolved ) , including its angular distance from center ( measured at the midpoint ) , length , position angle , and velocity range . the velocity range spanned by each filament is defined as the extreme velocities at which the filaments are detectable at or above the @xmath31 level in the channel maps as cross - checked against the moment maps . as mentioned in paper  i , the lengths of the inner , western , eastern , and now also e2 filaments are difficult to quantify precisely because they do not have smoothly varying intensity profiles ; here , we use the same method as in paper  i , with their lengths defined as the difference in radial positions of their emission centroids either at or close to their opposite ends in velocity ( eastern and western filaments ) or where their angular separation is largest ( inner and e2 filaments ) .",
    "this method likely underestimates slightly their true lengths .",
    "their position angles correspond to that measured from the center of per  a through their midpoints as estimated by eye in the moment maps .",
    "we note that , compared to the values previously tabulated ( table  1 in paper  i ) , the largest difference is for the inner filament which is now much longer and spans a larger velocity range .",
    "this is because the error in continuum subtraction ( as described towards the end of @xmath32[observations and data reduction ] ) most strongly affects the inner filament , which now extends much further beyond the nucleus on the eastern side .",
    "the western filament is detectable over a slightly larger velocity range because the improved continuum subtraction and increased sensitivity permits previously undetectable ( i.e. , below @xmath31 in the channel maps ) portion of the filament to now be detectable .",
    "the position - velocity ( pv- ) diagrams of the western and eastern filaments have not changed qualitatively ( see @xmath32[position - velocity diagrams ] ) , and provide if anything a more confident fit ( given the improved sensitivity ) to the model presented in paper  i whereby these filaments are in free - fall along the gravitational potential of perseus  a. the revised dynamical age of the western filament is @xmath023  myr and eastern filament @xmath028  myr ; i.e. , of order @xmath0@xmath4  yr as estimated in paper  i.    the e2 and w1 filaments are best resolved in the uniformly - weighted moment maps of figure  [ uniform - weighting ] .",
    "we have therefore derived their lengths and position angles by fitting gaussian structures to these filaments in the uniformly - weighted maps but without imposing any cutoffs to preserve error statistics .",
    "we find both to be aligned radially with respect to the center of per  a within measurement uncertainties ( no more than @xmath0@xmath33 ) . for w2 ,",
    "we tabulate only its radial distance from and its position angle relative to the center .",
    "as mentioned in paper  i , the co(21 ) features detected along the east - west direction ( all now confirmed to be genuine ) appear to be associated with h@xmath1 emission , but not those detected either to the north ( n1 , which is too weak to be detected in the present observation ) or south ( s1 , which is not confirmed in the present observation ) . to properly understand whether all the detected co(21 ) features have h@xmath1 counterparts , we have carefully examined whether n1 and s1 are artifacts related to imperfect removal of sidelobes .    in figure  [ artifact ] , we show both dirty ( before deconvolving the telescope psf ) and clean ( after deconvolving the telescope psf ) maps of just the channel where s1 appears most strongly in the previous dataset .",
    "we also show in this figure the dirty beam ( the telescope psf ) . apart from n1 , portions of the eastern and western filaments are also present in this channel , with the western filament stronger than the eastern filament . by comparing the dirty map with the dirty beam",
    ", one can see that s1 is located at the first sidelobe of the western filament ( other sidelobes also are visible in the dirty map ) . to test whether s1 is an artifact related to this sidelobe",
    ", we also show in figure  [ artifact ] dirty maps with the western filament subtracted .",
    "as can be seen , s1 becomes much weaker , and is now no stronger than the remaining sidelobes ( from the eastern filament ) or noise peaks in the dirty map .",
    "this behavior is repeated in all channels where s1 is detectable , resulting in a spatial - kinematic structure for s1 that closely resembles the western filament ( see fig .  2 of paper  i ) .",
    "this exercise clearly demonstrates that s1 is just a sidelobe related to the western filament .",
    "a similar exercise reveals that n1 is a sidelobe of the inner and eastern filaments combined .",
    "furthermore , as can be seen in figure  [ 3pointing ] , both n1 and s1 lie outside the main body of molecular gas mapped with the iram  30-m telescope ; all the other confirmed genuine filaments coincide with ridges in the main body of molecular gas .",
    "figure  [ pv_diagram ] shows position - velocity ( pv- ) diagrams of all the filaments along radial directions . as can be seen , the improved continuum subtraction applied to the data in paper  i combined with the mosaic data has not resulted in any qualitative changes to the spatial - kinematic structures of any of the filaments , except for the detection of the new feature w2 . the pv - diagram along a position angle of @xmath34 ( top right panel ) that cuts through the both the inner extent of the western filament and w2 shows that w2 is not just spatially but also kinematically distinct from the western filament .",
    "we had hoped that the resulting improvement in sensitivity ( permitting also a slight improvement in angular resolution with uniform weighting ) over that attained in paper  i would reveal velocity patterns in the shorter filaments e1 , e2 , and w1 .",
    "sadly , no such patterns are discernible .",
    "both here and in the iram pdbi map of @xcite at a higher sensitivity , e2 can be seen to comprise two peaks that , especially in the latter map , appear be discontinuous in velocity .",
    "the stronger peak may show a velocity gradient , which if real increases in blueshifted velocities at decreasing radii just like the eastern and western filaments .",
    "figure  [ spectra ] shows spectra of the individual filaments at a velocity resolution of @xmath25 . in table",
    "[ gas_mass ] , we list the integrated flux density of each filament as derived from these spectra .",
    "note that the integrated flux density for the western filament contains a small contribution from w2 .",
    "the quoted uncertainty in the flux density of the inner filament includes the uncertainty in determining the continuum subtraction level ( a minor component of the error budget ) .",
    "none of the quoted uncertainties in flux densities , however , include any systematic uncertainty in absolute flux calibration that may be as large as @xmath020@xmath27 .",
    "we converted the integrated co(21 ) flux density of each filament to its corresponding mass in molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath35 ) gas using the same assumptions as in paper  i , thus facilitating a direct comparison with the single - dish map of @xcite ( as discussed later in ",
    "[ unrecovered emission ] ) .",
    "because of a trivial mistake in converting from flux density to brightness temperatures , all the values of molecular hydrogen gas masses quoted in paper  i are overestimated by a factor of @xmath36 ( but those numbers also need to be revised because of the imperfect continuum subtraction ) . in table",
    "[ gas_mass ] , we list the revised values for the molecular hydrogen gas masses of each filament .",
    "the conversion factor used for relating co(21 ) flux densities to molecular hydrogen gas masses is that believed to be appropriate for galactic molecular clouds @xcite ; this conversion factor is estimated to be @xmath05 times too high for the centrally concentrated molecular gas ( disks ) in ultraluminous infrared galaxies @xcite .",
    "the appropriate conversion factor for the molecular gas in per  a is not known .",
    "the filaments have increasingly larger masses with decreasing angular distance from the center along a direction that passes through the eastern filaments ( eastern filament and e1 ) , as well as through the inner filament and the western filaments ( western filament and w1 ) .",
    "the mass of the inner filament alone is comparable with that of the eastern and western filaments combined , and with the mass of molecular gas in normal spiral galaxies .",
    "these three filaments comprise @xmath0@xmath37 of the total mass of all the detected filaments .",
    "altogether the filaments have a total mass of @xmath38 , about one - half that measured by single - dish telescopes over the same region mapped in our mosaic observation of @xmath0@xmath39 @xcite . in @xmath40 , we examine how much of the co(21 ) emission detected with single - dish telescopes towards the filaments observed has been recovered in our interferometric observations .",
    "in paper  i , we found that the three spatially - resolved ( inner , western , and eastern ) filaments detected are radially aligned .",
    "we showed that the velocity pattern of the western and eastern filaments can be simply explained as free - fall in the gravitational potential of perseus  a. the improved pv - diagrams for the latter two filaments presented in this paper do not change this central conclusion .    in this paper",
    ", we find that e1 , e2 , and w1 like the three abovementioned filaments also comprise radially - aligned filaments . since our observations were made , @xcite also have reported that e1 and e2 comprise radially - aligned filaments .",
    "thus , in all , six distinct cool molecular filaments , three lying east of center and three lying west of center , have now been identified .",
    "their radial morphologies suggest that there is no significant transverse velocity component tracing orbital motion , arguing against the idea that some of the cool molecular gas detected may have been captured from a gas - rich galaxy .",
    "the lack of any transverse spatial component provides no support for ( but does not necessarily negate ) the idea that the cool molecular gas may have been dragged outwards by buoyant x - ray bubbles , as has been proposed to explain transverse h@xmath1 filaments seen in the outer regions of the nebula @xcite .",
    "as mentioned in paper  i , the observed co(21 ) filaments ( apart from n1 and s1 , which as shown in @xmath28 turn out to be artifacts ) are spatially coincident with bright h@xmath1 features . in figure",
    "[ co - haf ] , we plot contours of the integrated co(21 ) intensity on a color image of the h@xmath1@xmath29n[ii ] emission from @xcite .",
    "we have adjusted the contrast for the inner@xmath29western and eastern regions separately to better see the spatial relationship between the molecular and ionized gas in these regions .",
    "the inner filament is embedded in bright h@xmath1 emission that surrounds the nucleus . in both the eastern and western regions , every molecular filament , as well as the new feature w2 , is associated with locally bright h@xmath1 features . on the other hand , not all equally bright if not brighter h@xmath1 features , such as those labeled a  d in the middle panel and hii  region in the bottom panel of figure  [ co - haf ] , have co(21 ) counterparts . as discussed in paper  i and also @xcite , all the cool molecular filaments detected have velocities comparable if not identical with their h@xmath1 counterparts ( where measured ) .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite found a linear correlation ( albeit with considerable scatter ) between the globally integrated co and h@xmath1 luminosities for the central cd galaxies in putative x - ray cooling - flow clusters .",
    "@xcite find that this relationship extends to individual regions mapped in per  a at an angular resolution of @xmath012  with the iram-30  m. in figure  [ mass - haf - corr ] , we plot the integrated co(21 ) luminosities of the individual filaments in per  a against their corresponding h@xmath1 luminosities measured in an area encompassing the lowest co(21 ) contour of a given filament as seen in figure  [ co - haf ] .",
    "the h@xmath1 emission associated with the inner filament contains a substantial contribution from the agn , and so the value plotted constitutes an extreme upper limit on the emission actually associated with this filament ( as indicated by the arrow ) .",
    "the diagonal lines drawn in figure  [ mass - haf - corr ] correspond to different ratios between the co(21 ) and h@xmath1 luminosities .",
    "as can be seen , there appears to be an approximately linear relationship between the co(21 ) and h@xmath1 luminosities : a least - squares fit ( omitting the inner filament ) gives a ratio between the co(21 ) and h@xmath1 luminosity of @xmath00.0007 ( indicated by the solid line in fig .",

    "<S> we find no new features beyond the region previously mapped , and show that all six spatially - resolved features on both the eastern and western sides ( three on each side ) comprise radially aligned filaments . </S>",
    "<S> such radial filaments can be most naturally explained by a model in which gas deposited `` upstream '' in localized regions experiencing a x - ray cooling flow subsequently free falls along the gravitational potential of per  a , as we previously showed can explain the observed kinematics of the two longest filaments . </S>",
    "<S> all the detected filaments coincide with locally bright h@xmath1 features , and have a ratio in co(21 ) to h@xmath1 luminosity of @xmath0@xmath2 ; we show that these filaments have lower star formation efficiencies than the nearly constant value found for molecular gas in nearby normal spiral galaxies . on the other hand , some at least equally luminous h@xmath1 features , </S>",

    "<S> we demonstrate that all the cool molecular filaments are gravitationally bound , and without any means of support beyond thermal pressure should collapse on timescales @xmath3  yrs . by comparison , as we showed previously the two longest filaments have much longer dynamical ages of @xmath0@xmath4  yrs . </S>",
