    "magnetic fields are seen in main - sequence stars of most spectral types .",
    "they are usually considered to be either of fossil origin , arising from a conserved primordial field , or generated in a contemporary dynamo @xcite .",
    "the latter is the accepted explanation for magnetic stars with convective envelopes such as the low - mass ( @xmath1 ) main - sequence stars .",
    "the origin of the fields in the higher - mass magnetic ap and bp main - sequence stars with radiative envelopes is less certain .",
    "while a fossil origin remains possible , it has been proposed that magnetic fields may be generated by a dynamo mechanism driven by various instabilities , including the magnetorotational instability , in differentially rotating radiative regions of single stars ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the origin of the high field magnetic white dwarfs ( hfmwds ) has been the topic of much discussion in recent years .",
    "the incidence of magnetism in white dwarfs in the high field group ( @xmath2 g ) is estimated to be about 8 - 16per cent @xcite .",
    "a traditional explanation has been that the fields are of a fossil origin from the main sequence with magnetic flux conserved in some way during evolution to the white dwarf phase @xcite .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the strongly magnetic ap and bp  stars could not be their sole progenitors because the birth rate of these main - sequence stars is insufficient to explain the observed birth rate of the hfmwds .",
    "however this turned out not to be a strong argument against the fossil hypothesis . in an earlier paper @xcite noted that it could be reconciled if about @xmath3per cent of late b  stars had fields below the observed threshold for ap and bp  stars .",
    "this would be consistent with the observations of @xcite who conducted a volume - limited study of the magnetic ap and bp  stars within 100pc of the sun .",
    "their study has shown that the incidence of magnetism in intermediate mass stars increases with the mass of the stars . at @xmath4 the fraction of magnetic among non - magnetic stars",
    "is only @xmath5per cent , while at @xmath6 it is 37.5per cent .",
    "some 50per cent of stars are in binary systems .",
    "as these evolve some can interact and merge .",
    "so we may expect that some stars that appear single today are the result of the merging of two stars .",
    "the possibility of generating strong magnetic fields during such merging events has often been discussed in the literature as an alternative explanation for magnetic fields in certain classes of stellar object . indeed , as an alternative to the fossil field model , @xcite proposed that the strong fields in the magnetic a , b and o  stars are generated as stars merge",
    ".    here we focus on the hypothesis that the entire class of hfmwds with fields @xmath7 owe their magnetic fields to merging @xcite .",
    "this model was first devised to explain the observation that there are no examples of hfmwds in wide binary systems with late - type companions while a high fraction of non - magnetic white dwarfs are found in such systems @xcite .    in the common envelope scenario ,",
    "when a giant star fills its roche lobe , unstable mass transfer can lead to a state in which the giant s envelope engulfs both cores .",
    "as the two cores spiral together , energy and angular momentum are transferred from their orbit to the differentially rotating common envelope until it is ejected , leaving behind a close binary system , or a merged single object . in the original model for formation of hfmwds",
    "@xcite envisaged that the fields are generated by a dynamo in the common envelope and diffuse into the partially degenerate outer layers of the proto - white dwarf before the common envelope is ejected .",
    "if the end product is a single star it can have a highly magnetic core and if it is a very close binary , it can become a magnetic cataclysmic variable .",
    "@xcite attempted to model this phenomenon and found a potential problem in that the time - scale for the diffusion of the field into the white dwarf is generally significantly longer than the expected common envelope lifetime .",
    "@xcite suggested that strong magnetic fields in white dwarfs are generated by a dynamo process that feeds on the differential rotation in the merged object as it forms .",
    "a weak poloidal seed field that is already present in the pre - white dwarf core is amplified by the dynamo to a strong field that is independent of its initial strength but depends on the amount of the initial differential rotation .",
    "we note in this context that weak fields of @xmath8 kg may be present in most white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "presumably these can be generated in a core ",
    "envelope dynamo in the normal course of stellar evolution .",
    "@xcite proposed an alternative but similar model ( hereinafter the disc field model ) .",
    "they noted that if the companion were of sufficiently low mass it would be disrupted while merging and form a massive accretion disc around the proto - white dwarf .",
    "fields generated in the disc via the magnetorotational instability or other hydrodynamical instabilities could then be advected on to the surface of the proto - white dwarf and so form a hfmwd .",
    "such a model could apply to some merging cores within the common envelope , depending on component masses , and to post - common envelope merging double degenerate systems ( dds ) .",
    "it depends on the time - scale for the diffusion of the field into the white dwarf envelope .",
    "@xcite used the results of a three - dimensional hydrodynamic simulation of merging dds to argue that a massive hot and differentially rotating convective corona forms around the more massive component and used equipartition arguments to estimate that fields of about @xmath9 g could be generated .",
    "they also presented a population synthesis study of white dwarfs that formed specifically as merging dds , assuming a common envelope energy efficiency parameter @xmath10 , and showed that there is general agreement with the observed properties of high - mass white dwarfs ( @xmath11 ) and hfmwds .",
    "however they did not consider merging when the companion is a non - degenerate star .",
    "we hypothesize that single white dwarfs that demonstrate a strong magnetic field are the result of merging events , so we carry out a comprehensive population synthesis study of merging binary systems for different common envelope efficiencies @xmath0 .",
    "we consider all possible routes that could lead to a single white dwarf .",
    "we isolate the white dwarfs formed by the merging of two degenerate cores , either as white dwarfs , a red giant plus a white dwarf or two red giants , from those formed by a giant merging with a main - sequence star and show that the observed properties of the hfmwds are generally consistent with the common envelope hypothesis for @xmath12 .",
    "both groups contribute to the observed distribution but main - sequence companions merging with degenerate cores of giants form most of the hfmwds .",
    "when one of the stars in a binary system becomes a giant , it expands and overfills its roche lobe .",
    "mass transfer soon proceeds typically , but not always , on a dynamical time - scale @xcite .",
    "the giant envelope rapidly engulfs both the companion star and the core of the donor to form a common envelope .",
    "the two dense cores , that of the giant and the accreting star itself , interact with the envelope , transferring to it orbital energy and angular momentum . the envelope can be partly or wholly ejected and the orbit of the engulfed star shrinks .",
    "it is not known how long this process takes but it is generally thought to last for more of a dynamical stellar time - scale than a thermal or nuclear time - scale . it probably has never been observed .",
    "if the companion succeeds in fully ejecting the envelope the two cores survive in a binary system with a much smaller separation .",
    "if the envelope is not fully ejected the orbit may completely decays and the two stars coalesce .",
    "when the envelope of a giant engulfs a degenerate companion the two cores can merge but if the companion is non - degenerate it either merges with the envelope or accretes on to the giant core .",
    "when the initial masses of the two stars are within a few percent both can expand to giants at the same time and roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) leads to a double common envelope .",
    "the common envelope process was first proposed to explain binary star systems , such as cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , whose orbital separations are smaller than the original radius of the progenitor primary star .",
    "a mechanism was needed to explain how this could occur .",
    "the possible existence of common envelopes was first proposed by @xcite .",
    "its qualitative description is based on evolutionary necessity rather than mathematical physics . while it is sufficient to explain a variety of exotic stars and binaries that could not otherwise be explained , a full mathematical model has yet to be developed to describe the interaction in detail and to test the various theories .",
    "a simple quantitative model of common envelope evolution is the energy or @xmath0 formulism @xcite . for this",
    "the change in orbital energy @xmath13 of the in - spiralling cores is equated to the energy required to eject the envelope to infinity , the binding energy @xmath14 . the total orbital energy , kinetic plus potential , of a binary star with masses @xmath15 and  @xmath16 and separation @xmath17 is @xmath18 .",
    "however the envelope ejection can not be completely efficient so @xcite introduced an efficiency parameter @xmath0 to allow for the fraction of the orbital energy actually used to eject the envelope .",
    "@xmath19 following @xcite we use a form of the binding energy that depends on the detailed structure of the giant envelope and adopt @xmath20 where _",
    "r_@xmath21 is the radius of the primary envelope .",
    "the constant @xmath22 was introduced by @xcite to characterize the envelope structure .",
    "our @xmath22 depends on the structure of the particular star under consideration .",
    "it is sensitive to how the inner boundary between the envelope and the remnant core is identified @xcite and includes the contributions from the thermal energy of the envelope on the assumption that it remains in equilibrium as it is ejected .",
    "the initial orbital energy is that of the secondary star @xmath23 and the primary core @xmath24 at the orbital separation @xmath25 at the beginning of common envelope and is given by @xmath26 and the final orbital energy is @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the final orbital separation .",
    "thus we have @xmath29 from this we can calculate @xmath28 which is the separation of the new binary if the cores do not merge . if @xmath28 is so small that either core would overfill its new roche lobe , then the cores are considered to merge when @xmath28 is such that the core just fills its roche lobe . setting @xmath30 to this separation",
    "we calculate @xmath31 and @xmath32 with equations [ ermf ] and [ deltaeorb ] .",
    "then we calculate a final binding energy for the envelope around the merged core @xmath33 assuming this envelope has a normal giant structure @xmath34 we calculate how much mass must be lost . in the case of a double common envelope , the initial orbital energy is that of both cores and the binding energies of the two envelopes added .    some difficulties with the energy formulation arise because @xmath0 can depend on the duration of the common envelope phase . if it lasts longer than a nuclear or thermal time - scale then alterations in the envelope , owing to adjustments in its thermal equilibrium , can change its structure and hence @xmath22 .",
    "changes to the energy output from the core , owing to the decreasing weight of the diminishing envelope , can also affect the thermal equilibrium and thence @xmath22 .",
    "we do not consider these complications in this work . nor do we include ionization and dissociation energy , as proposed by @xcite in the envelope binding energy .",

    "it is plagued by observational biases . in magnitude - limited surveys , such as the palomar - green ( pg ) or the hamburg - schmidt surveys ,",

    "the results of the k  s test for a range of @xmath0s ( table  [ tab : kstest ] ) show that the mass distribution is consistent over the wide range @xmath86 . on the other hand ,",
    "based on the results in table  [ tab : magwd_perc ] the observed incidence of magnetism , as observed in the @xcite volume - limited sample , constrains @xmath0 to be in the narrower range @xmath87 .",
    "two competing models for the origin of strong magnetic fields in white dwarfs are broadly the fossil field model and the merging star model . the proponents of the fossil field model have noted that the maximum poloidal flux observed in the magnetic ap and bp stars is similar to the maximum poloidal magnetic flux observed in the magnetic white dwarfs .",
    "the two groups of stars could therefore be evolutionarily linked . however , to date , there have been no stellar evolution models that have shown how a strong fossil magnetic flux can survive through the various stages of stellar evolution through to the white dwarf phase .",
    "it is also not clear if the similarities in the maximum magnetic fluxes between two groups of stars is necessarily a reason to assume a causal link .",
    "the dynamo model of @xcite suggests that similar maximum magnetic fluxes may be expected for physical reasons if the fields are generated from differential rotation caused by merging .",
    "here we have explored the consequences of such a hypothesis for the origin of the hfmwds with binary population synthesis under standard assumptions , discussed in section [ sec : calculations ] .",
    "we have found the following .    * while the mass distribution of hfmwds is not very sensitive to @xmath0 , good agreement can be obtained with both the observed mass distribution and the observed incidence of magnetism for models with @xmath88 .",
    "in particular the mean predicted mass of hfmwds is @xmath89 compared with @xmath90 ( corrected to include observational biases ) for all white dwarfs while observations indicate respective mean masses of @xmath91 ( see also * ? ? ? * ) and @xmath92 @xcite",
    ". a k  s test shows that the small number of reliably measured masses of hfmwds are not distributed in the same way as the masses of non - magnetic single white dwarfs .",

    "on the other hand our best model fit to the observed mass distribution of hfmwds has a probability of 0.71 .",
    "* stars that merge during common envelope evolution and then evolve to become white dwarfs outnumber merging post - common envelope dd systems for all @xmath0 .",
    "the common envelopes yield mainly co  white dwarfs with a few he and one  white dwarfs , while the dds yield only co  white dwarfs . *",
    "the major contribution to the observed population of hfmwds comes from main - sequence stars merging with degenerate cores at the end of common envelope evolution .",
    "the resulting giants go on to evolve to hfmwds . *",
    "the merging dds tend mostly to populate the high - mass end of the white dwarf mass distribution .",
    "we also note that the study by @xcite of the evolution of a sample of sdss post - common envelope binary stars consisting of a white dwarf and a main - sequence star indicates that the best agreement with observational data is achieved when @xmath10 and this is consistent with our findings .    in summary ,",
    "available observations of the mass distribution and incidence of hfmwds are compatible with the hypothesis that they arise from stars that merge mostly during common envelope evolution with a few that merge during post - common envelope evolution as dd systems .",
    "our calculations , when taken together with the observation that there are no examples of hfmwds in wide binary systems , allow us to argue strongly in favour of this hypothesis . in the majority of cases the fields may be generated by a dynamo mechanism of the type recently proposed by @xcite . the disc field model of @xcite or",
    "the model proposed by @xcite may be relevant in the case of merging dd cores depending on mass ratio .",
