    "towards the next generation of mobile and wireless networks , _ machine - to machine _",
    "( m2 m ) communications @xcite is expected to play a significant role and form the basis for the future _ internet of things _ ( iot ) .",
    "m2 m communications offers a wide range of applications providing various services @xcite , such as the smart grid , the e - health system , _ vehicle - to - vehicle _ ( v2v ) communications , and etc .",
    "however , with the rapid growth of the m2 m market , the number of m2 m devices deployed in a wireless communication network is anticipated to be tremendously increased in the coming years and can potentially exceed 50 billion by the year 2020 @xcite , thus posing significant challenges to current radio access networks .    in lte and lte - advance @xcite ,",
    "once a transmission is triggered by some random event , the device initiates a _ random access _ ( ra ) procedure by firstly sending a randomly chosen preamble to indicate its active status , followed by a resource allocation by the serving _ base station _ ( bs ) based on the detection @xcite . according to the lte specifications , each cell",
    "is assigned a pool of 64 zadoff - chu sequences @xcite as preambles . however",
    ", a collision will occur if two or more devices have randomly selected the same preamble .",
    "when the number of accessing devices becomes excessively large , the simultaneous access attempts will incur a high probability of collisions in the ra procedure .",
    "hence , the network will easily become overloaded and congested , leading to high detection failure rate and large access delay .",
    "apart from a huge number of m2 m devices , the messages in m2 m communication scenarios are in general highly correlated , e.g. , due to proximity , the same service type , and etc @xcite . as a result , it is reasonable to partition the devices into a number of clusters , thus a balk of similar requests can be handled in a single shot .",
    "moreover , since the m2 m traffic is characterized by the sporadic communication among a huge number of devices @xcite , each device has a low probability of being active , thus exhibiting a certain level of sparsity in the device detection process . in this context , _ compressed sensing _ ( cs ) @xcite-@xcite is becoming a proper paradigm to deal with high - dimensional signals with a sparse representation , where signal acquisitions can be done in a significantly reduced sampling rate .",
    "moreover , cs has been identified as one of the key drivers behind the efforts to cope with the tremendous scaling issues due to massive connectivity @xcite@xcite .    motivated by the cs principles and recognizing the cluster - like behavior as well as the sparsity in the m2 m traffic",
    ", the activation pattern of the m2 m devices can be formulated as a particular block sparse signal  with additional in - block structure  in cs based applications .",
    "thus the device detection process can be mapped into the recovery procedure of such a sparse signal .",
    "in addition , for large - scale networks like m2 m communication networks , distributed resource allocation schemes @xcite , where each device determines its resource allocation autonomously , are in general highly preferred due to their better scalability with the size of the network .",
    "since the centralized control by the bs is not needed , the distributed schemes call for much less coordination and information exchange between the devices , thus the signaling overhead can be substantially reduced and adapted according to the size of the network .      in this work ,",
    "we investigate in a novel distributed device detection scheme of the network activation pattern based on cs techniques to facilitate efficient resource allocation strategies for large - scale m2 m communication networks .",
    "the proposed scheme targets to cope with tremendous scaling issues aroused by the massive connectivity in m2 m communications , especially for enhanced device detection probability and reduced access delay . in the proposed scheme",
    ", the m2 m devices deployed in the network are partitioned into clusters in advance and devices in each cluster are assigned a unique signature of a particular design for their initial access .",
    "after acquisition of the transmitted signatures from the devices , the proposed scheme mainly conducts two essential steps :    * \\(i ) the bs detects the active clusters and the number of active devices in each cluster , and then assigns a certain amount of resources accordingly .",
    "* \\(ii ) each active device detects its ranking among the active devices in its cluster and accesses the corresponding resource assigned by the bs based on the ranking .",
    "a particular signature design for the devices in each cluster is investigated to facilitate the detection process of step ( i ) at the bs side and step ( ii ) at the device side . besides",
    ", a novel algorithm based on the count - sketch procedure @xcite@xcite is developed for the realization of step ( i ) to cope with complexity issues due to the massive number of devices . and",
    "step ( ii ) is performed based on some conventional greedy algorithms such as _ orthogonal matching pursuit _ ( omp ) @xcite and _ iterative hard thresholding _",
    "( iht ) @xcite but with side information of the feedback from the bs to enhance the performance robustness and to reduce the computational complexity .",
    "theoretical analysis presents a rigorous proof that the proposed scheme is able to efficiently reduce the signal acquisition time with much less computational complexity . in particular , the following theorem holds .",
    "[ theorem_1 ] suppose that the activation pattern of the m2 m devices is modeled as an arbitrary block sparse binary signal @xmath0 with block sparsity @xmath1 and in - block sparsity @xmath2 over block size @xmath3 , and the signatures transmitted by the m2 m devices are modeled as the measurement matrix @xmath6 following the structure designed in section [ sec : algorithm_matrix ] . by applying the block sketching algorithm for decoding at the bs and the modified omp for decoding at the m2 m devices ,",
    "@xmath7 can be reliably reconstructed by the proposed distributed device detection scheme with overwhelming probability if the dimension of the transmitted signatures @xmath8 with computational complexity of @xmath5 .    for a random @xmath9-sparse signal of length @xmath10 , @xmath11 measurements are sufficient for robust signal recovery by conventional cs algorithms like _ basis pursuit _ ( bp ) @xcite or omp , and the computational complexity is of @xmath12 for bp @xcite and @xmath13 for omp @xcite .",
    "therefore , the proposed scheme requires much less measurements since @xmath14 and significantly reduced computational complexity , thus achieving a better scaling with the increasing network size .",
    "moreover , extensive simulations confirm the robustness of the proposed scheme in the detection process , especially in terms of higher detection probability and reduced access delay when compared with conventional schemes like lte ra procedure and classic cluster - based access approaches .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : background ] provides an overview on prior work and known results regarding the target problem .",
    "the general introduction of the proposed distributed device detection schemes is presented in section [ sec : scheme ] , for both full - duplex and half - duplex networks respectively .",
    "section [ sec : model ] sets up a mathematical model for the proposed scheme , and the detailed detection algorithms are introduced in section [ sec : algorithms ] .",
    "theoretical analysis on the performance guarantees for the proposed scheme are discussed in section [ sec : theory ] . in section [ sec : simulation ] , numerical results are presented and evaluated . finally , section [ sec : conclude ] concludes the paper with some final remarks .      throughout this work ,",

    "_ compressed sensing _ ( cs ) has emerged as a new framework for efficient signal acquisition and reconstruction by finding solutions to underdetermined linear systems with sparsity priors or related compressibility properties .",
    "cs builds on the revelation that a signal having a sparse representation in one basis can be recovered from a small number of projections onto another basis that is incoherent with the first @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the cs is a concrete protocol for sensing and compressing data simultaneously .",
    "let @xmath25 be an original signal to be recovered and @xmath26 be a representing basis or dictionary such that the signal can be expressed as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the corresponding coefficient vector . if all except for @xmath9 entries of @xmath29 are zero , i.e. @xmath30 , then the signal @xmath31 is called to be @xmath9-sparse . in this case",
    "the main objective is to recover @xmath7 from @xmath32 compressive ( undersampled , that is @xmath33 ) measurements @xmath34 given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is usually called the measurement matrix .",
    "several sufficient conditions on the measurement matrix @xmath37 are known to ensure that a @xmath9-sparse signal @xmath7 can be accurately reconstructed from the compressive measurements @xmath38 .",
    "a widely considered condition is the _ restricted isometry property _ ( rip ) @xcite stating that there should exist a constant @xmath39 such that @xmath40 holds for all @xmath9sparse vectors @xmath7 .",
    "rip ensures that @xmath9-sparse vectors are mapped almost  isometrically by @xmath37 .",
    "however , it is a well - known fact that rip is only sufficient but not necessary for uniform recovery of sparse signals . overcoming this issue , the _ nullspace property _ ( nsp ) provides both sufficient and necessary conditions on @xmath37 for robust sparse signal recovery , which basically requires that any vector in the kernel space of @xmath37 is far from being sparse ( see , e.g. , the book @xcite for details and additional references on rip and nsp ) .",
    "random matrices with _ independent and identically distributed _ ( i.i.d . )",
    "( sub ) gaussian @xcite and @xmath41bernoulli @xcite distributed entries follow the rip and nsp condition _ with high probability _ ( w.h.p . ) in the @xmath42regime : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is some constant ( see exemplary @xcite for an overview on these results ) .",
    "several algorithms have been proposed for reconstruction of the original signal @xmath7 from the undersampled measurements @xmath38 . the canonical approach @xcite@xcite uses linear programming to solve the @xmath45 minimization problem @xmath46    this problem can be solved in polynomial time but the computational complexity of @xmath12 @xcite renders it impractical for many applications .",
    "additional methods have been proposed involving greedy pursuit methods such as omp @xcite and iht @xcite , which build up a signal approximation iteratively by making locally optimal decisions , and bring the computational complexity down to the order of @xmath47 . in some practical applications even this reduced complexity can be a bottleneck as it is the case in our setting and then fast sketching algorithms need to be considered .      in large - scale networks , it is preferred that the algorithms for resource allocation are amenable to distributed implementation @xcite .",
    "distributed resource allocation schemes allow each transmitter to determine its local decisions autonomously without the need for global coordination , which introduces an inherent robustness to communication failures and environmental uncertainties .",
    "therefore , distributed schemes call for significantly less information exchange between wireless devices . as a result , the signaling overhead can be substantially reduced and adapted according to the network size",
    ". therefore , distributed schemes in general achieve better scalability with the number of devices in a network , which is an attractive property for large - scale networks .",
    "network resource allocation is often modeled as a utility maximization problem @xcite-@xcite , which is flexible to accommodate a wide range of performance metrics through an appropriate assignment of utility functions . a number of gradient / subgradient methods @xcite have been proposed to solve such problems in a distributed way . however , these methods are sensitive to the choice of stepsizes , leading to slow and unstable convergence . in @xcite ,",
    "some distributed newton - like algorithms @xcite are introduced that obtain high tolerance of errors in the stepsize calculation .",
    "there also exist faster numerical convex problem solvers , e.g. , the nonlinear jacobi algorithm @xcite , which converges fast under certain contraction conditions . furthermore",
    ", pricing algorithms in distributed systems have also been widely approached with game theory @xcite@xcite , since those scenarios fit naturally within the game theoretic frameworks .",
    "there are many approaches to the problem of device detection in large - scale m2 m communication networks based on the cs theory .",
    "apart from the lte ra procedure @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite proposed some cluster - based approaches to manage the m2 m traffic in the uplink direction . according to these approaches ,",
    "wireless devices are partitioned into clusters and a cluster head is selected for each cluster to handle the uplink traffic from the cluster members .",
    "the cluster heads process and fusion the requests from their cluster members , and then forward the accumulated messages periodically to the serving bs .",
    "however , this approach calls for efficient interaction between the cluster head and the cluster members , which leads to large signaling overhead and excessive processing delay .    in @xcite , meng _ et.al",
    "_ simply adopted the detection algorithms from the probabilistic bayesian framework for the sparse event detection in _ wireless sensor networks _",
    "( wsn ) . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors applied greedy cs detection algorithms for jointly decoding the multi - user activity and data in _ code division multiple access _ ( cdma ) systems .",
    "it is shown that an application of the cs methods can greatly reduce the length of the spreading sequences , thereby leading to a higher network throughput . however , both of the schemes directly applied the standard cs decoding algorithms for device detection at the central controller , which ignores the correlation in the behavior among the m2 m devices and the additional sparsity in the activation pattern , thus leading to non - optimality in the processing especially in terms of efficiency and computational complexity .",
    "the authors of @xcite proposed a sparse signal recovery scheme via decentralized in - network processing for event detection in wdn based on a consensus optimization formulation .",
    "however , since a random sleeping strategy is used to enforce the compressive data collection , the detection field for each active time slot is rather uncertain and may lead to incorrect detection decisions with high probability .",
    "moreover , none of the schemes exploits the cluster - like behavior among the devices , which exhibits a certain level of correlation in the device activations .",
    "standard cs decoding algorithms need to be appropriately adjusted in order to facilitate the specific sparsity feature in the activation patterns of the m2 m devices for more efficiency in the device detection and resource allocation process .",
    "furthermore , the detection scheme should be implemented with low computational complexity and distributed processing possibility , since the m2 m devices are ordinarily configured with limited processing capability and battery power . in this section ,",
    "we introduce an efficient mechanism for distributed device detection and resource allocation for large - scale m2 m communication networks , which fully exploits the specific sparsity feature in the activation pattern of the m2 m devices .",
    "since the m2 m devices in general exhibit highly correlated behaviors , e.g. , due to proximity , the same service type , and etc , it is reasonable to partition the devices into a number of clusters , thus a balk of similar requests can be handled in a single shot . and",
    "a device can be assorted into multiple clusters based on different features .",
    "the cluster structures are known both at the bs and at the devices during the device registration process to the network and updated periodically .",
    "besides , both the bs and each device in the network have the knowledge of channel information from other devices to itself , which can be possibly obtained via statistical channel knowledge @xcite , location - based estimation @xcite , channel reciprocity @xcite or long - term observation @xcite .    furthermore , a ranking among the devices in each cluster is conducted in advance in order to determine the order for the active devices to access a pool of assigned resource blocks by the bs . as a result ,",
    "the active devices access the corresponding resources according to their ranking in the cluster .",
    "the devices can be ranked according to some pre - defined rule , e.g. , based on the order of the device i d or the service priority . and the ranking information is also informed to all the m2 m devices in advance by the bs after the device registration .",
    "in addition , since the m2 m traffic exhibits a certain level of sparsity in the detection activity , each device has a low probability of being active at a certain time slot . in general",
    ", we observe that at a given time instant , only several clusters become active and only a small number of devices in those active clusters are triggered to access the network , where a cluster is called to be `` active '' if one or more devices from the cluster are active .",
    "thus , a twofold sparsity pattern , namely the _ block sparsity _ and _ in - block sparsity _ , can be defined to model the active status of the devices .    * * block sparsity : * only several of the cluster become active at a certain time instant .",
    "* * in - block sparsity : * only several devices from the same cluster are active .    in our proposed scheme ,",
    "the devices in each of the clusters are assigned a unique signature used to indicate their active status to the network , the design of which is different from the preambles ( zadoff - chu sequences ) in the lte ra procedure and will be introduced in details in section [ sec : algorithm_matrix ] . each of the signatures indicates the membership to a particular cluster , and is informed to the devices in the corresponding clusters in advance .",
    "a full - duplex system allows data to be transmitted in both communication directions at the same time , which means the signals can be transmitted and received simultaneously , while half - duplex systems only allow communication in a single direction at a time .",
    "usually the terms `` full - duplex '' and `` half - duplex '' are used to describe point - to - point systems , whereas in this work we extend them to multi - point systems composed of multiple connected entities that communicate with each other .",
    "therefore in this work , `` full - duplex '' means an m2 m device can both transmit and receive data on the wireless channel simultaneously .",
    "depending on the network configuration whether the full - duplex mode is supported by the devices or not , the proposed scheme for distributed device detection and resource allocation in large - scale m2 m networks is differentiated into the following two cases .      if the communication network is configured to support the full - duplex mode , the proposed scheme mainly consists of four phases , which are illustrated in figure [ fig : phases ] .",
    "* * phase 1a : clustering * as the devices are partitioned into clusters and the devices in each cluster is designed to obtain a unique signature , all these relevant information is informed to the devices and updated periodically by the bs .",
    "the information includes the cluster ids , the devices in each cluster , the ranking information of the devices , and the uniquely - designed signatures distributed to each of the clusters . * * phase 2a : signal acquisition * once the devices become active and start accessing the network , they transmit simultaneously the assigned signatures to indicate their active status to the network . with full - duplex transceivers , all the devices and the bs",
    "receive individual linear combinations of the transmitted signatures . * * phase 3a : decoding at bs * the bs detects the active clusters , the number of active devices in each cluster , as well as the collision patterns in the received measurements .",
    "then it broadcasts this information to the devices and assigns a certain amount of resources to each of the detected active clusters accordingly . *",
    "* phase 4a : decoding at devices * each active device performs device detection for its corresponding cluster using its received signal and the broadcast information from the bs in phase 3 .",
    "then it detects its ranking among all the active devices in the cluster and accesses the corresponding resource block assigned by the bs for transmission .",
    "if the communication network is configured as a half - duplex system , then we introduce a cluster head for each of the clusters in advance .",
    "the cluster heads are selected with the property not to transmit concurrently with the other devices in the same cluster .",
    "besides , the cluster heads are supposed to know the cluster structures as well as the estimated channel information from the cluster members to themselves . to this end",
    ", the proposed scheme under the half - duplex assumption performs the procedures as follows .    *",
    "* phase 1b : clustering * the cluster information including the cluster heads and the information involved in phase 1a under the full - duplex assumption is informed to the devices by the bs during the initial device registration to the network . * * phase 2b : signal acquisition * after the active devices transmit their individual signatures to indicate their active status , both the bs and the cluster heads collect their own measurements , which are linear combinations of the transmitted signatures . *",
    "* phase 3b : decoding at bs * same as phase 3a under the full - duplex assumption . * * phase 4b : decoding at cluster heads * the cluster heads of the active clusters perform device detection for their corresponding clusters and detect the ranking of the active devices in their clusters using the same decoding algorithms as proposed for phase 4a under the full - duplex assumption . *",
    "* phase 5b : resource access * each cluster head broadcasts the detected ordering information of the active devices to the members in the cluster , and those active devices access the corresponding resource blocks for transmission based on their ranking afterwards .",
    "the message flows involved in the proposed schemes under both full - duplex and half - duplex assumptions are illustrated in figure [ fig : flow ] .",
    "in this section , we set up the mathematical model to describe the target problem and elaborate on the proposed scheme introduced in section [ sec : scheme ] .",
    "consider an m2 m network with @xmath10 devices , which are partitioned in advance into @xmath48 clusters of equal size @xmath3 according to some pre - defined criteria .",
    "as defined in section [ sec : scheme ] , the twofold sparsity pattern of the m2 m devices , namely the _ block - sparsity _ and _ in - block - sparsity _ , are @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "that is , only @xmath1 out of @xmath48 clusters are active , and the number of active devices in each cluster is at most @xmath2 .",

    "<S> in this work , we utilize the framework of _ compressed sensing _ ( cs ) for distributed device detection and resource allocation in large - scale _ machine - to - machine _ ( m2 m ) communication networks . </S>",
    "<S> the devices deployed in the network are partitioned into clusters according to some pre - defined criteria , e.g. , proximity or service type . moreover , the devices in each cluster are assigned a unique signature of a particular design that can be used to indicate their active status to the network . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed scheme in this work mainly consists of two essential steps : ( i ) the _ base station _ ( bs ) detects the active clusters and the number of active devices in each cluster using a novel _ block sketching algorithm _ , and then assigns a certain amount of resources accordingly . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) each active device detects its ranking among all the active devices in its cluster using an enhanced greedy algorithm and accesses the corresponding resource for transmission based on the ranking . </S>",
    "<S> the particular design for both full - duplex and half - duplex networks are investigated . by exploiting the correlation in the device behaviors and the sparsity in the activation pattern of the m2 m devices , </S>",
    "<S> the device detection problem is thus tackled as a cs support recovery procedure for a particular binary block - sparse signal @xmath0  with block sparsity @xmath1 and in - block sparsity @xmath2 over block size @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical analysis shows that , using the proposed scheme , the activation pattern of the m2 m devices can be reliably reconstructed within an acquisition time of @xmath4 , which achieves a better scaling and less computational complexity of @xmath5 compared with standard cs algorithms . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , extensive simulations confirm the robustness of the proposed scheme in the detection process , especially in terms of higher detection probability and reduced access delay when compared with conventional schemes like lte _ random access _ ( ra ) procedure and classic cluster - based access approaches .    </S>",
