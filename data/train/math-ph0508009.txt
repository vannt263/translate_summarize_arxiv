    "we study semirelativistic hamiltonians @xmath1 composed of the relativistically correct expression @xmath2 @xmath3 for the energy of a free particle of mass @xmath4 and momentum @xmath5 and of a coordinate - dependent static interaction potential @xmath6 @xmath7 which may be chosen arbitrarily , apart from the constraint imposed on @xmath1 that it be bounded from below : @xmath8 the eigenvalue equation generated by this kind of hamiltonian is usually called the spinless salpeter equation . it arises as a well - defined approximation to the bethe - salpeter formalism for the description of bound states within ( relativistic ) quantum field theory @xcite when it is assumed that the bound - state constituents interact instantaneously and propagate like free particles @xcite . at the same time",
    ", @xmath1 may be regarded as the simplest and perhaps most straightforward generalization of a ( nonrelativistic ) schrdinger operator towards the incorporation of relativistic kinematics . for many potentials",
    ", this hamiltonian can be shown @xcite to be bounded below and essentially self - adjoint , and its spectrum can be defined variationally . for definiteness , we consider the corresponding eigenvalue problem in three spatial dimensions .    in sec .  2 we review the well - known tangential schrdinger upper bounds which may be found @xcite-@xcite either by use of optimized operator inequalities or by the exploitation of the concavity of the salpeter kinetic - energy @xmath9 as a function of @xmath10 the new schrdinger bounds which are the principal concern of this paper are derived by considering operator differences",
    "we shall now illustrate the main idea by considering a nonrelativistic example .",
    "suppose we wish to estimate the bottom of the spectrum of @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are positive and @xmath14 since @xmath15 we conclude from the theorem of weyl @xcite-@xcite that @xmath16 we note in passing that for the ground - state energies discussed here , the weyl inequality follows immediately by applying the exact normalized wave function @xmath17 corresponding to @xmath18 as a trial function for the terms of the sum .",
    "thus we have @xmath19 of course , we assume that the operator domains allow this .",
    "it remains to optimize the expression for @xmath20 with respect to @xmath21 thus we find in the example @xmath22 =   \\min_{\\omega}\\left[e_4\\left((1+\\omega)^2\\alpha\\right)^{1/3}-e_2\\left(\\omega\\beta\\right)^{1/2}\\right],\\eqno{(1.5)}\\ ] ] where in three dimensions we have for the respective spectral bottoms @xmath23 the coupling dependence is found by the general scaling law @xmath24 for pure powers @xmath25 for our problem and the special case @xmath26 we find the result @xmath27 by this reasoning we determine the energy of @xmath28 with error less than @xmath29 in sec .",
    "3 we shall show how this idea can be applied to the salpeter eigenvalue problem .",
    "the kinetic - energy term @xmath30 in the hamiltonian @xmath31 is a concave function of @xmath10 thus tangents to @xmath9 generate upper schrdinger operators @xmath32 of the form @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the point of contact between the tangent @xmath35 and @xmath36 elementary analysis allows us to obtain the following formulas for the coefficients @xmath37 and @xmath38 : @xmath39 if an eigenvalue of the schrdinger operator @xmath40 is given by @xmath41 then we have by the variational characterization of the discrete spectrum of @xmath1 that the corresponding eigenvalue @xmath20 of @xmath1 is bounded by the inequality @xmath42.\\eqno{(2.3)}\\ ] ] the minimum in this expression simply picks out the energy of the best upper tangential operator . we have shown earlier @xcite that these ` envelope bounds ' are identical to those obtained by optimizing over the parameter @xmath43 in the upper bound for @xmath44 implied by the inequality @xmath45 namely @xmath46 the link between the two expressions for the bound is the parameter relation @xmath47    the advantage of the tangential bound is its generality : it applies to each discrete eigenvalue that exists for the upper operator . for later comparison",
    "we consider three examples .",
    "we restrict our attention to the lowest eigenvalue , which is the subject of the difference upper bound discussed in sec .  3 below .       by the spectral equivalence @xmath49 we see that the exact energy is given by @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the first zero of airy s function @xmath52 that is to say @xmath53 in order to compute the envelope bound we may re - parametrize ( 2.2 ) in terms of @xmath54 and find @xmath55",
    "the tangential hamiltonian then becomes @xmath56 the lowest eigenvalue of this operator is then given by @xmath57 if we minimize @xmath58 with respect to @xmath59 we find @xmath60 this is about @xmath61 high .",
    "in this case the hamiltonian @xmath1 is equivalent to the schrdinger operator @xmath63 whose exact energy @xmath20 is straightforward to find numerically and is given by @xmath64 meanwhile the tangential operator is given by @xmath65 and has lowest energy @xmath66 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are given by the formulas ( 2.2 ) .",
    "a minimization of @xmath67 with respect to @xmath68 yields the best upper bound @xmath69 this bound is about @xmath70 high .",
    "as @xmath4 is increased in the operator @xmath71 the problem spectrally ( and monotonically ) approaches the schrdinger limit @xmath72 for which the envelope approximation is exact .",
    "this very symmetrical operator is truely non - local but yields easily to a variational treatment in a hermite basis of the form @xmath74 in such a basis , each term is form invariant with respect to transformations to momentum space .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath1 has earlier been studied by boukraa and basdevant @xcite with the aid of special methods for solving problems in momentum space .",
    "thus we know that the bottom of the spectrum of @xmath1 to @xmath75 places is @xmath76 by use of the tangential bound we obtain an upper family of operators of the form @xmath77 the corresponding lowest eigenvalue is given by @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 by minimizing over @xmath59 we find the best upper bound to be @xmath81 that is to say , about @xmath82 high .",
    "we shall return to these examples in sec .  4 and find sharper upper estimates .",
    "the upper bound we shall discuss was discovered in connection with our studies of the semirelativistic many - body problem .",
    "for the @xmath83-particle case the bound is most easily constructed by means of the following defining equations : @xmath84 where @xmath85 and the parameters @xmath86 and @xmath87 are positive .",
    "we shall assume that the harmonic oscillator potential @xmath88 dominates the potential @xmath89 for large @xmath90 .",
    "in this case the operators @xmath91 and @xmath92 are both schrdinger operators whose spectral bottoms we write respectively as @xmath93 and @xmath94 these energies can of course be found equivalently from eigenproblems expressed in coordinate or momentum space .",
    "we let @xmath20 be the bottom of the spectrum of @xmath1 and we express the relation between the hamiltonian operators in the form @xmath95 it is clear by an elementary variational argument applied to ( 3.3 ) that we can conclude the weyl energy inequality @xcite-@xcite @xmath96 by re - writing ( 3.4 ) and optimizing with respect to the free positive parameters @xmath86 and @xmath87 , we find that our best such difference upper bound to @xmath20 is given by @xmath97.\\eqno{(3.5a)}\\ ] ] by adding and subtracting the oscillator @xmath98 in the reverse way we arrive , by exactly similar reasoning , at an alternative difference upper - bound formula given by @xmath99,\\eqno{(3.5b)}\\ ] ] where the corresponding operators @xmath100 and @xmath101 are defined by @xmath102 equations ( 3.5a ) and ( 3.5b ) summarize the principal results of this paper .",
    "we now consider the three problems mentioned in sec .  2 .",
    "in each case we must solve the corresponding schrdinger problems , @xmath18 and @xmath103 defined in ( 3.2 ) , and then minimize the corresponding eigenvalue difference @xmath104 with respect to the parameters @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "the corresponding pair of schrdinger operators given by ( 3.2 ) become @xmath105 we find from ( 3.5a ) @xmath106       the corresponding pair of schrdinger operators are @xmath107 from ( 3.5a ) we find @xmath108       the corresponding pair of schrdinger operators are given by @xmath109 we can derive the best upper bound provided by eq .",
    "( 3.5 ) analytically in this case .",
    "we find @xmath110 = { { ( \\phi,2r\\phi)}\\over{(\\phi , \\phi ) } } = { 4\\over{\\sqrt{\\pi}}}\\approx 2.25676,\\eqno{(4.6)}\\ ] ] where @xmath111 we can see this by the following argument . if we let the bottom of the spectrum of the perturbed oscillator @xmath112 be @xmath113 and we write @xmath114 and @xmath115 then by scaling arguments we obtain the equation @xmath116.\\eqno{(4.7)}\\ ] ] this expression provides an upper bound for every choice of @xmath59 and @xmath117 the difference will be small when both the expressions for @xmath118 are small , that is to say , when @xmath59 and @xmath68 are large . in the limit of small @xmath119 we know by perturbation theory that the approximation @xmath120 is asymptotically exact .",
    "thus we find in this small-@xmath118 limit that @xmath121 the minimum implies that @xmath122 and the small-@xmath118 limit implies that @xmath123 thus the best upper bound provided by the smallest spectral difference is given by the right - hand side of ( 4.8 ) , as claimed above .",
    "it is evident that the difference upper bound leads to more accurate results for these problems than does the envelope upper bound .",
    "we note that the bounds provided by the alternative difference inequality ( 3.5b ) are very similar in numerical quality .",
    "the main attraction of the salpeter hamiltonian @xmath124 is that it captures some relativistic features whilst remaining a relatively simple operator . by simple we mean that for many potentials , its spectrum can be defined variationally .",
    "thus it is in principle straightforward to find energy upper bounds by exploring a finite - dimensional trial space .",
    "the main technical difficulty concerning the hamiltonian is that , apart from the harmonic oscillator @xmath125 the hamiltonian is in general non - local . in the present paper",
    "we explore a new class of schrdinger operator differences that provide upper bounds .",
    "the ultrarelativistic linear problem @xmath126 shows that in some cases we may expect to obtain analytical results from these bounds .",
