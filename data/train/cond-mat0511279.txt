    "when an ensemble of particles is at a sufficiently high density , the fluid will often freeze to form a crystalline solid .",
    "this freezing is driven by the repulsion that invariably exists between particles when at close separations .",
    "the question that naturally arises is : how much repulsion is needed for freezing and what crystal structures are formed ?",
    "the answer is that even particles interacting via repulsive pair potentials @xmath0 that are finite for all separations @xmath1 can freeze @xcite .",
    "the particular crystal structure that is formed depends upon the form of the particle interactions and especially on the ` softness ' of the decay of @xmath0 as @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there can be solid  solid transitions , with different crystal structures being stable in different portions of the phase diagram . in this paper",
    "we present a simple density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite for determining the location of the melting and solid  solid phase boundaries for soft  core particles .    for the purposes of this paper ,",
    "we define ` soft  core ' particles as those with purely repulsive pair potentials @xmath0 , for which the integral over all space of @xmath0 is finite , i.e.  @xmath3 .",
    "alternatively , one can define soft ",
    "core potentials as those for which the fourier transform @xmath4 of the pair potential exists . commonly encountered ( model ) potentials in the theory of liquids such as the coulomb potential , the hard  sphere potential or the lennard ",
    "jones potential @xcite do not fall into this category .",
    "however , a wide class of fluids can be modelled by particles interacting via potentials that do fall into the soft  core category .",
    "one common example is the yukawa core model ( ycm ) : @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "such a potential is used to model the effective interaction between charged point particles , where the coulomb interaction between the particles is screened by a background medium .",
    "the effects of the screening are incorporated in the parameter @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "examples of systems where the particle interactions can be modelled by a yukawa pair potential range from charged colloidal solutions @xcite to dusty plasmas @xcite .",
    "another soft  core potential is the gaussian core model ( gcm ) : @xmath9 the freezing behaviour of a fluid composed of particles interacting via such a potential aroused much interest due to the novel re",
    " entrant melting behaviour : for certain temperatures , on increasing the fluid density , the fluid freezes .",
    "however , on further increasing the density , the crystal re  melts @xcite .",
    "the high density phase of the gcm is the fluid state @xcite .",
    "a gaussian potential is used to model the effective interaction between the centres of mass of polymers , star ",
    "polymers and dendrimers in solution @xcite . in this case",
    "@xmath10 , the radius of gyration of the polymers .",
    "the dft theory for freezing presented here is a simple qualitatively accurate theory which , for the cases we have tested , gives the correct topology of the phase diagram , including the existence of solid  solid phase transitions ",
    "i.e. the theory incorporates in a simple way much of the physics of the solid phases of soft core particles .",
    "furthermore , we believe the present theory is of general interest to the classical dft community , since many dft theories are unable to describe solid  solid coexistence .",
    "for example , in refs.@xcite the authors applied dfts that are very successful for hard  spheres to fluids composed of particles interacting via yukawa and inverse power pair potentials and found them not to predict the bcc phase .",

( [ eq : f_ex ] ) is formally derived by ` turning  on ' the interactions between the particles ( via the parameter @xmath21 ) and integrating @xmath19 as @xmath22 is increased from 0 to 1 keeping @xmath12 fixed @xcite .",
    "the main approximation in our theory involves replacing the function @xmath23 by a simple ansatz .",
    "this is given below ; first we make a few remarks about @xmath12 .    when in the uniform fluid state , the one - body density is a constant , @xmath24 , the average number density , where @xmath25 is the number of particles and @xmath26 is the volume of the system .",
    "however , when the system freezes into a solid the density becomes periodic , i.e.  the symmetry breaks and @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is a lattice vector for the solid phase .",
    "an approximation that is often made in dft studies of freezing @xcite , is to assume that the density profile of the solid is made up of gaussian peaks centred on each lattice site : @xmath29 with @xmath30 , \\label{eq : rho_solid_g}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is a parameter which describes how localised the particles are around each lattice site .",
    "this density profile assumes the normalisation condition that there is one particle per lattice site .",
    "of course , this assumption need not necessarily be true .",
    "we can expect to find vacancies in the crystal , and indeed for the present soft ",
    "core systems we may find another type of defect : double occupancy , since the particle cores can overlap . however , we expect the proportion of defects to be small , and assume a perfect crystal with sites singly occupied .",
    "together with the assumption that @xmath12 takes the form in eq.([eq : rho_solid ] ) we make the further assumption that @xmath32 takes the form : @xmath33 this constitutes an rpa like approximation for @xmath23 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : f_ex ] ) , with the ` self  energy ' term in the summation over lattice vectors , @xmath34 , being subtracted .",
    "when @xmath31 is sufficiently large so that there is negligible overlap between the density peaks on neighbouring lattice sites , our assumption is equivalent to : @xmath35 where the length @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the distance between nearest neighbour lattice sites .",
    "this approximation therefore constitutes quite a drastic simplification of the function @xmath23 , which neglects much of the information about correlations in the system that this function contains .",
    "( [ eq : f_ex_2 ] ) is very appealing because it takes the form of a double convolution and can therefore be written in the form : @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the fourier transform of @xmath41 . since @xmath41 is a gaussian function , then so is @xmath40 .",
    "the ideal gas contribution to the helmholtz free energy ( [ eq : f_id ] ) also takes a simple form if we assume @xmath12 is given by eq.([eq : rho_solid ] ) and we further assume that @xmath31 takes values sufficiently large that the overlap between the gaussian density peaks on neighbouring lattice sites is negligible .",
    "then the ideal gas part of the helmholtz free energy , eq .",
    "( [ eq : f_id ] ) , is simply ( see e.g.  @xcite ) @xmath42 .",

    ". we can therefore calculate the helmholtz free energy for a number of candidate crystal structures and then the equilibrium crystal structure is that with the lowest free energy . in order to determine the melting phase boundary we could compare this minimal value of @xmath48 with that calculated from the theory applied to the liquid state and then perform the common tangent construction between these free energies ( which is equivalent to equating chemical potentials and pressures in the coexisting phases @xcite ) . in the liquid state , where @xmath49 , the ideal gas contribution to the helmholtz free energy ( [ eq : f_id ] ) becomes @xmath50 , \\label{eq :",

    "the lindemann criterion simply states that when the root ",

    "[ fig:1 ] .",

    "the present theory predicts this maximum to be at a temperature @xmath62 , whereas it is actually at @xmath63 @xcite . in general , the present theory over estimates the region of stability for the solid phases .",
    "we also determine an approximate melting boundary by calculating the locus in the phase diagram where the bcc free energy equals the liquid state free energy @xcite , where the liquid helmholtz free energy is calculated using the crude approximation , eq .",

    "melting @xcite .",
    "this bending over of the fcc  bcc boundary was ascribed to anharmonic effects in the crystal @xcite . in an attempt to incorporate this effect we assumed the density took the form given in eq .",

    "the biggest difference between the ycm and the gcm phase diagram is that there is no re - entrant melting in the ycm .",

    "this can be traced to the use of the gibbs  bogoliubov inequality to construct their theory .",
