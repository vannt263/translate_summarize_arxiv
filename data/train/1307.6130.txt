    "our current understanding of the novel properties displayed by the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) formed in ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions @xcite relies heavily on solving relativistic dissipative fluid dynamics @xcite .",
    "the equations of relativistic fluid dynamics form a set of complicated nonlinear partial differential equations , describing the conservation of energy - momentum and a conserved charge ( such as net baryon number),@xmath0 in the presence of dissipation , the above equations are not closed and have to be supplemented by nine additional equations of motion , i.e. , the time evolution equations for the the bulk viscous pressure , heat flow , and shear - stress tensor .    the simplest formulation of relativistic dissipative fluid dynamics are the navier - stokes equations .",
    "however , due to instabilities and acausal signal propagation in these equations @xcite , they are not usually used in numerical simulations .",
    "currently , most fluid - dynamical simulations of the qgp employ the relaxation - type equations derived by israel and stewart israel:1979wp to close the conservation laws .",
    "while some analytic solutions of the non - relativistic navier - stokes equations are widely known @xcite , very few analytical ( or semi - analytical ) solutions of relativistic fluid dynamics bjorken:1982qr , csorgo:2003rt , csorgo:2003ry , csorgo:2006ax have been obtained and most simulations of heavy ion collisions solve dissipative fluid dynamics numerically",

    "we use the same symmetry arguments to derive solutions of israel - stewart theory , which can be relevant to the description of the qgp .",
    "like the well known bjorken solution @xcite , the fluid dynamic variables in the dissipative solutions we obtain are invariant under lorentz boosts in one direction , and are appropriate for comparison to data from heavy - ion collisions near mid - rapidity , which are approximately invariant under limited boosts in the beam direction .",
    "however , unlike the bjorken solution , they also have nontrivial radial expansion .",
    "thus , the solutions found in this paper provide the most rigorous tests to date for the current numerical algorithms used to solve the viscous relativistic fluid dynamic equations in heavy ion collisions .",

    "even though other terms can be included in the dynamical equation for the shear - stress tensor baier:2007ix , noronha:2011fi , for simplicity in this paper we consider only the terms present in ( [ pieq ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ pieq ] ) contains two transport coefficients , @xmath19 and @xmath26 . in a conformal fluid ,",
    "the shear viscosity coefficient is always proportional to the entropy density , @xmath27 , while the shear relaxation time must be proportional to the inverse of the temperature , @xmath28 . without loss of generality ,",
    "the relaxation time is parametrized as , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is a constant .",

    "we obtain @xmath54 , which is the metric in @xmath55 , where @xmath56 corresponds to the 3-dimensional de sitter space .",

    "one can show that @xmath83 and @xmath84 obey the same differential equations and , since we impose the same initial conditions for these fields , @xmath85 .",

    "given the definition of @xmath94 , it is consistent to have @xmath95 finite and nonzero ( @xmath94 is a ratio between two quantities that should vanish when @xmath96 ) .    when @xmath97 , we have only a single equation left over for the temperature and the analytical solution is the one found in gubser1,gubseryarom @xmath98where @xmath99 is a positive constant ( so then @xmath100 is positive - definite ) . using the dictionary in ( [ transformf ] )",

    "this effect may be connected with the well - known causality issue ( see , for instance , denicol:2008ha , pu:2009fj ) of the relativistic navier - stokes equations .",
