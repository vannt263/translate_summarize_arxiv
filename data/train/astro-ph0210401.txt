    "the resulting position angle is @xmath42 in good agreement with the position angle of @xmath43 reported for the superluminal jets ( d.hannikainen , private communication ) and with the position angle of @xmath44 reported for the radio western jet @xcite . to determine if the jet tails lie along the jet axis , we calculated the average azimuthal angle for events between @xmath45 and @xmath46 from the western jet position and within @xmath47 in azimuth of a vector pointing back to xte j1550564 .",

    "the tail of the western jet appears aligned with the jet axis in the march data , but may be slightly skewed to the south in the june data .",
    "however , the skew is only marginally statistically significant and may be affected by uncertainty in the true position of the jet peak , discussed below .    to study the morphology and motion of the x - ray jet , we decomposed the image along axes parallel and perpendicular to the jet axis ( as defined above ) .",

    "the best match occurred for an offset of @xmath54 .",
    "given this offset , the ks test gives a 61% probability that the two samples are drawn from the same parent distribution . to evaluate the uncertainty in the offset",

    "these are @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the hypothesis that the two distributions are the same with zero offset is rejected at the level of @xmath57 . the western jet moved by @xmath3 between the march and june observations .",

    "a ks test is consistent with the two profiles being the same .",
    "the figure also shows the data for xte j1550564 itself from the march observation , rescaled and displaced to match the peak at western jet . from its time variability , we know that the x - ray emission from xte j1550564 must arise from what is effectively a point source for the angular resolution of chandra .",
    "hence , we use xte j1550564 as a calibration of the point spread function for the observation to determine the spatial extent of the emission from the western jet .",
    "this procedure accounts for any aspect jitter during the observation and also for any source extent induced by scattering of the x - rays in the interstellar medium between us and the source .",
    "the spectrum of xte j1550564 during the march observation is quite similar to that found for the western jet , so effects due to the energy dependence of the chandra point spread function should be negligible .",
    "both sources are sufficiently close to the aimpoint so that the degradation of the chandra point spread function off axis should also be negligible .",

    "we used x - rays with energies in the range 0.37  kev and with displacements along the jet axis of up to @xmath58 from the respective source position as reported in table  [ tablesrc ] .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test shows that the two distributions are inconsistent at the 97% confidence level ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "the western jet may be slightly extended perpendicular to the jet axis , but the evidence is weak .",
    "deconvolving , assuming that the physical width adds in quadrature with the instrumental width , we place an upper limit of @xmath60 ( fwhm ) on the extent of the x - ray western jet perpendicular to the jet axis .",
    "the perpendicular distribution of the western jet found from the june data is consistent with that in the march data .",
    "the x - ray western jet is clearly much more extended along the jet axis than perpendicular to it .",
    "to investigate the variability of the x - ray western jet , we examined archival chandra data on xte j1550564 from june , august , and september 2000 . using a large region extending @xmath61 perpendicular to the jet axis and covering the full extent of the western jet beginning @xmath62 from xte j1550564 and extending @xmath45 beyond its position in 2002",

    "combining the august and september 2000 observations , in which the acis was not partially blocked by a grating , we find 6 counts in a total exposure of 9557  s. given a mean of 6 , the 90% confidence upper bound from a poisson distribution is 9 counts leading to a 90% confidence upper bound on the count rate from the western jet of 0.00094  c / s .",
    "this is 6% of the rate in the march 2002 observation , corresponding to an upper bound on the absorbed flux ( assuming identical spectral parameters ) of @xmath64 in the 0.38 kev band .",

    "however , two data points are insufficient to determine the shape of light curve decay .",
    "the new chandra observations add one additional detection to the results presented in @xcite .",
    "the source contains far fewer counts than the western jet and so we concentrate on the position and flux of the source .    the proper motion of the eastern jet is shown in fig .  [ motion ] .",
    "the figure includes the three data points from @xcite and our new data point for 11 march 2002 .",
    "@xcite showed that the apparent velocity of the eastern jet in 2000 was lower than the minimum velocity allowed during the superluminal ejection @xcite , thus indicating that the eastern jet has decelerated .",
    "the march 2002 point is inconsistent with an extrapolation of the velocity measured from the 2000 data and indicates that this deceleration has continued .",
    "we fit the proper motion data with a model in which the jet has a deceleration proportional to its velocity relative to the x - ray binary ( which we assume to be roughly at rest relative to the interstellar medium ) .",
    "the velocity profile is then a decaying exponential and the observed position evolution is modified by light travel delays .",
    "our model has three fitted parameters : the initial jet speed divided by the speed of light @xmath67 , the time scale ( @xmath65-folding time ) for the velocity decay @xmath68 , and the jet angle relative to the line of sight @xmath69 .",

    "for source distances larger than 5.1  kpc , the best fit initial speed is larger than the speed of light .",

    "for a distance of 3  kpc , the best fit is @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 .",
    "both of these fits are consistent with the lower bound on the initial jet speed from the vlbi observations @xcite .",

    "these large scale jets appear to arise from a relatively brief jet injection episode @xcite and , therefore , offer a unique opportunity to study the large - scale evolution of an impulsive jet event .    in the following , we assume that both jets were created in a single injection episode in september 1998 .",
    "the assumption is motivated by the detection of superluminal jets @xcite following an extremely large x - ray flare in september 1998 and the absence of any other x - ray flare of similar magnitude in continual x - ray monitoring from 1996 to 2002 @xcite .",

    "the eastern jet has a projected physical separation of @xmath93 .    for comparison with the properties of the western jet , we review the properties of the eastern jet at the same angular separation . from the linear fit in @xcite , we find that the eastern jet passed through a separation of @xmath0 on mjd @xmath94 . fortuitously",
    ", this is consistent with the times of the 21 august 2000 , and 11",
    "september 2000 chandra observations ( the separations from both of those observations are consistent with @xmath0 ) .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the high proper motion of the eastern jet when at a separation of @xmath0 argues strongly against it having reached a termination at that point .",
    "the continued motion of the eastern jet to larger separations demonstrated here reinforces this argument . at a separation of @xmath0 ,",
    "the apparent speed of the eastern jet was @xmath95 and the absorbed flux was @xmath96 in the 0.3 - 8 kev band .",
    "the western ( receding ) jet flux at the same separation was a factor of @xmath97 higher than the eastern ( approaching ) jet flux .",
    "the x - ray data provide measurements of the local apparent speed at equal angular separations from the origin for the approaching and receding jets .",
    "if the jets are symmetric , in terms of their velocity profiles , then it would be possible to use relativistic kinematics @xcite to constrain the jet true speed @xmath98 , inclination to the line of sight @xmath69 , and distance @xmath99 .",
    "we find that @xmath100 and that @xmath101 under the assumption that the jet propagation is symmetric .",
    "this would imply that the inclination angle @xmath102 and that the jet speed @xmath103 ( allowing for the uncertainty in @xmath104 ) .",
    "however , the fact that the western ( receding ) jet is brighter than the eastern ( approaching ) jet argues against symmetric jet propagation . for symmetric jet propagation , the ratio of observed flux densities measured at equal separations from the core for a twin pair of optically - thin isotropically emitting jets is      where @xmath106 is the approaching flux density , @xmath107 is the receding flux density , @xmath98 is the jet speed divided by the speed of light , @xmath69 is jet inclination angle , @xmath108 is the spectral index of the emission defined so @xmath109 , and @xmath110 is a parameter which is 2 for a continuous jet and 3 for discrete condensations @xcite . if the exponent @xmath111 , then the approaching jet must be always be brighter than the receding jet measured at the same angular separation from the core . given the photon index quoted above ( allowing the absorption to vary ) and allowing a continuous jet , the minimum allowed value for the exponent is 2.6 which is well above zero .",
    "hence , the observed brightness ratio @xmath112 is inconsistent with symmetric jet propagation .",
    "however , because the x - ray jet detections occurred well after the initial jet ejection , we can not independently constrain the jet ejection , which may have been symmetric .",
    "large intrinsic asymmetries have been observed in the radio for the jets from the microquasar gro j165540 @xcite . which of the two jets was brighter differed from day to day , while the kinematics of the jet propagation appeared symmetric .",
    "asymmetries of similar magnitude could explain the ratio of x - ray fluxes from the jets of xte j1550564 if the jet inclination angle is high . in this case , the x - ray emissivity of the western jet would need to be low early on , to be consistent with the non - detection in 2000 , and then increase sharply at later times , to be consistent with the flux measured in 2002 .",
    "such an x - ray emissivity profile could be produced by , e.g. , internal shocks produced by a faster plasmon overtaking a slower one .",
    "this would require re - acceleration of particles in the jet long after its initial ejection .",
    "alternatively , the emission from the jets could be produced by shocks arising from interactions of the jets with the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the jets appear to be moving with speeds much greater than the sound speed of the ism . in this case",
    ", the supersonic motion of the jet should produce a shock wave .",
    "the shock will be strongest at the head of the head and weaken around the sides of the jet @xcite .",
    "this morphology matches that observed for the eastern jet . in this case",
    ", the asymmetry between the two jets may reflect non - uniformity in the ism .",
    "if the western jet is propagating into a denser medium , it would be brighter and would have decelerated more than the eastern jet .",
    "interaction of a relativistic plasmon with the ism appears to consistently describe all of the available data on the large scale jets of xte j1550564",
    ".    continued observation of the jets of xte j1550564 offers an exciting opportunity to study the dynamics of relativistic jets on time scales inaccessible for agn jets .",
    "new , deep observations of xte j1550564 will allow us to study the deceleration and evolution of the morphology , flux , and spectrum of the western jet .",
    "this may help determine whether the observed jets are due to the internal interactions of relativistic plasmons or due to external interactions with the ism .",
    "a deep observation may also permit a new detection of the eastern jet which would further constraint its deceleration and decay .",
    "finally , continued monitoring may eventually show the termination of the jets .",
    "we thank harvey tananbaum for granting the ddt observations , joy nichols for exceptionally rapid processing of the data , and the cxc team for successfully executing the observation .",

    "<S> we report on x - ray observations of the the large - scale jets recently discovered in the radio and detected in x - rays from the black hole candidate x - ray transient and microquasar xte j1550564 . on 11 march 2002 , </S>",
    "<S> x - ray emission was detected @xmath0 to the west of the black hole candidate and was extended along the jet axis with a full width at half maximum of @xmath1 and a full width at 10% of maximum intensity of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the morphology of the x - ray emission matched well to that of the radio emission at the same epoch . the jet moved by @xmath3 between 11 march and 19 june 2002 . </S>",
    "<S> the apparent speed during that interval was @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> this is significantly less than the average apparent speed of @xmath5 from 1998 to 2002 , assuming that the jet was ejected in september 1998 , and indicates that the jet has decelerated . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray spectrum is adequately described by a powerlaw with a photon index near 1.8 subject to interstellar absorption . </S>",
    "<S> the unabsorbed x - ray flux was @xmath6 in the 0.3 - 8  kev band in march 2002 , and decreased to @xmath7 in june . </S>",
    "<S> we also detect x - rays from the eastern jet in march 2002 and show that it has decelerated and dimmed since the previous detections in 2000 . </S>"
