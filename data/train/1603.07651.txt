    "; piotto et al .",
    "2012 ) , but the phenomenon is apparently universal ( piotto et al .  2012 , 2015 ) .",
    "the formation mechanisms for these multiple populations remain unclear ( see renzini et al",
    ".  2015 ) .    even before the existence of stellar sub - populations in globular clusters",
    "was known , there was considerable evidence for peculiarities in the morphology of the horizontal branch ( hb ) .",
    "in particular , there was the well - known `` second parameter '' problem , first mentioned by sandage & wallerstein ( 1960 ; see also sandage & wildey 1967 ; van den bergh 1967 ) ; it refers to the observation that parameters other than metallicity ( such as age and he abundance ) must affect the color distribution of hb stars ( see catelan 2009 for a review ) .",
    "in those clusters where the hb distribution is sufficiently broad in color , a series of discontinuities is also evident , although the appearance of these features varies with the bandpasses employed , manifesting themselves as gaps , jumps , overluminous stars , or subluminous stars .",
    "three prominent examples of such discontinuities are the `` grundahl jump '' ( g - jump ) within the blue hb ( bhb ) at @xmath111,500  k ( grundahl et al .  1998 , 1999 ) , the `` momany jump '' ( m - jump ) within the extreme hb ( ehb ) at @xmath120,000  k ( momany et al .",
    "2002 , 2004 ) , and the gap between the ehb and `` blue - hook '' stars ( also known as `` late hot flasher '' stars ; dcruz et al .",
    "1996 , 2000 ) , spanning @xmath132,00036,000  k ( sweigart 1997 ; brown et al .",
    "2001 ) . here",
    "we have adopted the usual naming convention for hb stars : ehb stars are those at @xmath220,000  k , while bhb stars are those hotter than the rr  lyrae instability strip ( i.e. , hotter than @xmath18,000  k ) but cooler than the ehb . both grundahl et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and momany et al .",
    "( 2004 ) noted that their respective jumps appear to be ubiquitous features of globular clusters hosting sufficient numbers of bhb and ehb stars , but the surprising consistency of hb gaps in distinct clusters was recognized somewhat earlier ( ferraro et al .  1998 ) .",
    "similarly , the blue - hook phenomenon appears to be common in those clusters hosting an hb population that extends sufficiently far to the blue , but because optical colors become degenerate at the temperatures of ehb stars , uv photometry is needed to confirm their presence ( dcruz et al .  2000 ;",
    "brown et al .  2001 ; dalessandro et al .  2008 ; dieball et al .  2009 ;",
    "brown et al .  2010 ) .",
    "in a review of hot stars in globular clusters , moehler ( 2001 ) explored various explanations for hb discontinuities , including diverging evolutionary paths , mass loss , distinctions in cno or rotation rates , dynamical interactions , atmospheric processes , he mixing in red giants , and statistical fluctuations . with time",
    ", it has become increasingly clear that atmospheric processes play a dominant role in these hb features .",
    "spectroscopy of stars on either side of the hottest discontinuity demonstrates that , compared to normal ehb stars , blue - hook stars have atmospheres greatly enhanced in he and c ( moehler et al .  2011 ; brown et al .",
    "2012 ) , as expected if they formed through a late he core flash that mixed the h - rich envelope with the inner convective regions ( a process known as flash mixing ; sweigart 1997 ; cassisi et al .",
    "the bhb stars hotter than the g - jump exhibit metal abundances enhanced via radiative levitation , he abundances diminished via gravitational settling ( moehler et al .  1999 , 2000 ; behr 2003 ; pace et al .",
    "2006 ) , and lower surface gravities than expected from canonical bhb models ( see moehler 2001 and references therein ) .",
    "stellar evolution models that include atomic diffusion have had qualitative success reproducing the observed abundance patterns in bhb stars ( michaud et al .",
    "2007 , 2008 ) .",
    "sweigart ( 2002 ) first noted that the onset of radiative levitation on the bhb coincided with the disappearance of surface convection .",
    "the interplay between atomic diffusion and surface convection was explored more fully by cassisi & salaris ( 2013 ) ; they noted that by itself , surface convection should not be enough to suppress radiative levitation in stars cooler than the g - jump , implying that other processes , such as turbulence and rotation , must also play a role .",
    "in addition to abundance differences , there is a clear bimodality in rotation on the bhb ( recio - blanco et al .",
    "2002 , 2004 ; behr 2003 ) ; stars hotter than the g - jump are generally slow rotators ( @xmath3  sin  @xmath4  km s@xmath5 ) , while stars cooler than the g - jump are generally fast rotators ( with @xmath3  sin  @xmath6 as high as 40 km s@xmath5 ) .",
    "although the source of this bimodality remains unclear , recio - blanco et al .",
    "( 2002 , 2004 ) have speculated that the dearth of fast rotators hotter than the g - jump could be due to a loss of angular momentum through stellar winds , driven by the high atmospheric metallicity at such temperatures .",
    "quievy et al .",
    "( 2009 ) have argued that meridional circulation in the fast rotators plays a role in the disruption of atomic diffusion in stars cooler than the g - jump .",
    "the consistency of these hb features , and any exceptions to that consistency , are difficult to explore with the heterogeneous observations available in the literature . however , a new catalog of uv and blue photometry , resulting from a _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ treasury survey of globular clusters , is well suited to this task ( piotto et al .",
    "2015 ) . in this paper ,",
    "the seventh in a series associated with the survey , we characterize these hb features in a diverse set of 53 clusters , including clusters with significantly complex populations .",
    "we then use these comparisons to explore the implications for the atmospheric phenomena and the evolutionary history of hot stars in globular clusters .",
    "our analysis employs photometry obtained with the uvis channel of the wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) on board _ hst _ , largely derived from the uv - initiative treasury program 13297 ( pi : piotto ) , but supplemented with data from other guest observer programs ( e.g. , go-12311 , go-12605 ; pi piotto ) . for @xmath0  cen",
    ", we use the photometry of bellini et al .",
    "( 2013a , and also in prep . ) , which draws upon archival wfc3 data , including those from calibration programs . the observations employed the f275w ( near - uv ) , f336w ( @xmath7 ) , and f438w ( @xmath8 ) filters ( figure  1 )",
    "the treasury program and data reduction are fully described in piotto et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , and the zero - point calibration and differential reddening corrections are detailed in milone et al .",
    "( 2015a ) .",
    "therefore , we will only briefly summarize the observations and data reduction here .",
    "images from program 13297 were obtained from aug 2013 to jun 2015 .",
    "the data were corrected for charge transfer inefficiency using a pixel - based algorithm developed by anderson & bedin ( 2010 ) for use with the advanced camera for surveys , but later modified for use with the wfc3 .",
    "photometry was performed on each individual exposure using a library of spatially - variable empirical point spread functions , combined into a single measurement for each star , and placed in the vegamag system .",
    "the primary goal of these imaging programs was to study the multiple populations on the ms and rgb .",
    "using observations of ngc  6752 , milone et al .",
    "( 2013 ) demonstrated that the multiplicity of globular cluster populations could be distinguished using the color index @xmath9 ; piotto et al .",
    "( 2015 ) subsequently demonstrated the utility of this index in a large set of clusters .",
    "for the cool stars on the ms and rgb , the f275w filter includes an oh molecular band , the f336w filter includes an nh molecular band , and the f438w filter includes cn and ch bands ( milone et al .",
    "we will not explore these features here , but they also affect the morphology of the red clump , which falls at similarly cool temperatures .    although the program was driven by a desire to characterize the ms and rgb , the same uv data provide insight into hot stars in later evolutionary phases . the hb population is well exposed , with photometric errors of @xmath10.01  mag and nearly 100% completeness . as on the ms and rgb ,",
    "the @xmath10 color index is useful for characterizing the hb morphology , but for entirely different reasons ( figure  1 ) . at hotter temperatures , the @xmath11 color tracks absorption from fe line blanketing in the near - uv , while the @xmath12 color spans the balmer discontinuity , making the @xmath10 index sensitive to atmospheric metallicity and surface gravity in hb stars .",
    "note that these broad - band filters are relatively insensitive to atmospheric he abundance , over the range generally encountered on the hb . specifically , taking the hb spectra at each of the four temperatures shown in figure  1 , if we decrease the atmospheric @xmath13 to 0.01 ( simulating the effects of he gravitational settling ) , or if we increase the atmospheric @xmath13 to 0.40 ( as associated with a self - enriched sub - population ) , the variations within each of our bands are @xmath140.03  mag , and generally @xmath10.01  mag ( see also sbordone et al .",
    "2011 ; girardi et al .",
    "2007 ; dalessandro et al .  2013 ) .    in figure  2",
    ", we show the @xmath10 index alongside the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of ngc  2808 , a massive globular cluster long known to host a peculiar hb morphology ( sosin et al .  1997 ; bedin et al .",
    "we highlight three discontinuities in the hb distribution : the g - jump ( labeled `` g '' ) , the m - jump ( labeled `` m '' ) , and the gap between the blue - hook stars and the normal ehb ( labeled `` b '' ) .",
    "while these breaks can be discerned in the individual colors comprising the @xmath10 index , they are amplified when the colors are combined in this index .",
    "furthermore , in these crowded fields , the photometric errors are correlated amongst the various bands ; in the color - color plane ( ccp ) , these errors are suppressed in both axes , while a cmd will suppress them in only one axis .",
    "in addition to these three prominent features , there are small gaps ( e.g. , at 0.4  mag and 0.8  mag in @xmath15 color ) , but these do not correspond to features within the hb distributions of the other clusters we will consider here , and could be statistical fluctuations ( see , e.g. , catelan et al .",
    "1998 ) . for reference",
    ", the peak in the @xmath10 index corresponds to an effective temperature of @xmath18,600  k , driven primarily by the sensitivity to the balmer discontinuity in the ( @xmath16 ) component of the index .",
    "this peak is well - defined in the ccp , falls in the middle of the hb color range , and is populated in nearly all of the clusters in our sample , so we shall use it as a reference point , hereafter called @xmath17 .",
    "the zahb models of brown et al .  ( 2010 ) that are used in the present paper were computed with a highly - modified version of the original princeton stellar evolution code ( schwarzschild & hrm 1965 ) .",
    "this code has been extensively updated over the years ( sweigart & demarque 1972 ; sweigart & gross 1974 , 1978 ; sweigart 1987 , 1997 ) .",
    "the equation of state ( eos ) is based on a tabulation of the fermi - dirac integrals and the various thermodynamic functions for both the non - relativistic and relativistic regimes . at low temperatures ,",
    "the eos solves the saha equation for the ionization of h and he , as well as the first ionization of 10 heavy elements , plus the formation of h@xmath18 .",
    "the code also incorporates the opal radiative opacities of rogers & iglesias ( 1992 ) , while at low temperatures , the molecular opacities of bell ( 1995 , private communication ) are used .",
    "the nuclear reaction rates are taken from caughlan & fowler ( 1988 ) , except for the @xmath19c(@xmath20 , @xmath21)@xmath22o reaction , where the higher rate suggested by weaver & woosley ( 1993 ) has been adopted .",
    "a further discussion of the input physics in our evolution code can be found in the description of the related pgpuc code of valcarce et al .",
    "( 2012 ) .",
    "this code has also been highly automated and , as a result , can follow the evolution of a globular - cluster star continuously from the ms up the rgb and then through the he - core flash , hb , and asymptotic - giant branch phases in a single computer run .",
    "for example , all of the hb sequences in brown et al .",
    "( 2010 ) were evolved continuously through the he flash , thereby avoiding the need to construct separate zahb models .",
    "convective overshooting and semi - convection in our hb models have been treated according to the method of robertson & faulkner ( 1972 ) .",
    "this method is applied between iterations of the henyey method and ensures that the radiative and adiabatic gradients agree to better than 10@xmath23 at the convective - core edge and within the semi - convective zone in the final converged models .",
    "in addition , the mixing length in our evolution code was calibrated by requiring that a solar model reproduce the solar luminosity and radius as well as the solar @xmath24 ratio at an age of 4.6 gyr .",
    "for our analysis , we will use the hb distribution of ngc  2808 as an empirical template for inspecting the hb distributions of the other clusters in the survey .",
    "this might seem like an unusual choice , because ngc  2808 is not at all representative of the milky way globular cluster system , being one of the most massive ( @xmath25  mag ; harris 1996 ) , with distinct ms and rgb sequences ( dantona et al .  2005 ; piotto et al .  2007 ;",
    "milone et al .",
    "2015b ) and prominent hb gaps ( bedin et al .",
    "however , the hb of ngc  2808 is well - populated across the full range of temperature , with stars in the red clump , bhb , ehb , and blue hook ( figure  2 ) .",
    "if any of its hb features are the result of universal atmospheric phenomena , as opposed to a product of the multiple populations driving the ms and rgb splitting , then these features should align with those present in the hb distributions of other clusters , as long as the corresponding hb locations are populated .    given the prominence of the discontinuities in the ccp of figure  2 , it is useful to compare the hb distribution of each cluster to that of ngc  2808 in this plane .",
    "distance is not a factor in a ccp , but extinction is ; we need to align the hb distributions with a fiducial that is independent of the hb discontinuities we are investigating .",
    "we use the @xmath17 for this purpose , which is well - populated in nearly all of our clusters .",
    "the only exceptions are 9 clusters with hb stars lying entirely in the red clump ; for completeness , we will include them here , and align them to ngc  2808 at the red clump , but their lack of stars hotter than the rr  lyrae instability strip makes them irrelevant to the investigation of hb discontinuities .",
    "a possible concern when making these empirical comparisons to ngc  2808 is that simple shifts within the ccp are implicitly making the assumption that the extinction vector is independent of spectral energy distribution ( sed ) . because the photometry here covers a broad wavelength range from the near - uv to the @xmath8 band , and because the hb stars in question span a broad temperature range of @xmath15,00040,000  k , this assumption is not entirely correct , but in fact the approximation is sufficient for the purpose of making empirical comparisons between the clusters .",
    "this is true even though our survey includes halo clusters with almost no foreground reddening and bulge clusters with significant reddening .",
    "the difference in foreground reddening for any cluster of our survey , when compared to that of ngc  2808 , can be as large as 0.5  mag in @xmath26 . to demonstrate the validity of this approximation",
    ", we show in figure  3 stellar structure models for the zero - age hb ( zahb ) in ngc  2808 ( brown et al .",
    "2010 ) , which assumed [ fe / h]=@xmath27 ( walker 1999 ) and no he enhancement . ]",
    "( i.e. , @xmath28  =  0 ) , transferred to the ccp using the lte synthetic spectra of castelli & kurucz ( 2003 ) and the wfc3 bandpass throughputs .",
    "in one case ( _ solid blue curve _ ) , unreddened synthetic spectra were used to transfer the structure models to the observable plane , and then shifted to align at the @xmath17 . in the other case ( _ dashed red curve _ ) , the structure models were transferred to the observable plane using spectra that were reddened with the fitzpatrick ( 1999 ) extinction curve , assuming @xmath26  =  0.5  mag , and then shifted to align at the @xmath17 .",
    "the deviation of the observations below the theoretical zahb curves between the g - jump and m - jump , due to radiative levitation , will be explored extensively below .",
    "the two curves agree with each other perfectly in the middle of the hb range ( by definition ) , but separate as one looks to the red and blue extremes of the hb .",
    "however , the distinctions between the models are small : at the location of the g - jump , using either the red curve or the blue curve to estimate the effective temperature of the g - jump would only change the estimate by 100  k ( 0.02  mag change in @xmath15 ) , while at the location of the m - jump , the temperature estimates would only differ by 500  k ( 0.04  mag change in @xmath15 ) .",
    "thus , even when comparing hb distributions of clusters with significantly distinct foreground reddening , the agreement in the colors of these features implies agreement in their temperatures at the level of @xmath1500  k or less . in cases where the colors of these discontinuities do not agree between clusters , their temperatures can be quantified with a theoretical zahb distribution tailored to match the cluster in question , including an sed - dependent foreground extinction .     as a fiducial .",
    "we demonstrate the accuracy of this approach by shifting a theoretical zahb distribution to align with the observations at the @xmath17 , using two different extinction assumptions . in one case ,",
    "no foreground reddening was applied before the alignment ( _ solid blue curve _ ) , and in the other , significant sed - dependent reddening was applied before the alignment ( _ dotted red curve _ ) , but the distinction between the two curves is small .",
    "the deviation of the observed bhb below the zahb curves at @xmath29  mag is due to radiative levitation blueward of the g - jump .",
    "the stars falling to the blue of the zahb curves , at @xmath30  mag , are blue - hook stars , with effective temperatures hotter than the canonical end of the ehb.,width=326 ]        another possible concern when comparing observed hb distributions to that of ngc  2808 is the effect of abundance distinctions between clusters .",
    "fortunately , zahb models demonstrate that the intrinsic @xmath15 color is not very sensitive to @xmath13 or [ fe / h ] at the effective temperatures of the @xmath17 ( @xmath18,600  k ) , the g - jump ( @xmath111,500  k ) , or the m - jump ( @xmath120,000  k ) , as demonstrated in figure  4 . in the top panels , we show the effects of [ fe / h ] ; in the bottom panels , we show the effects of @xmath13 . in the left panels ,",
    "we show the zahb distributions at their relative positions in the ccp , before any alignments are made ; in the right panels , we show the zahb distributions after they have been aligned at the @xmath17 reference point . because ngc  2808 is of intermediate metallicity ( [ fe / h ]  =  @xmath27 ; walker 1999 ) , using the @xmath17 to align clusters of either high or low metallicity incurs misalignments in @xmath15 color of less than 0.05  mag at the g - jump and m - jump . because the bhb stars near the @xmath17 in ngc  2808 are only moderately enhanced in he ( @xmath31 ; marino et al .",
    "2014 ) , using the @xmath17 to align clusters with little he enhancement or strong he enhancement incurs misalignments in @xmath15 color of less than 0.06  mag at the g - jump and m - jump , which corresponds to a @xmath32 difference of 240  k at the g - jump and 740  k at the m  jump .",
    "if the systematic errors from [ fe / h ] and @xmath13 went in the same direction , the misalignment could be as large as 0.1  mag .    in figure  5",
    ", we compare the hb distribution of ngc  2808 ( _ grey points _ ) to that of each of the other 52 clusters in our sample ( _ blue points _ ) .",
    "each of the hb distributions has been aligned to that of ngc  2808 at the @xmath17 , accounting for distinctions in composition and extinction . to aid these comparisons ,",
    "the 52 clusters have been sorted into five arbitrary categories ( explained below ) with increasingly blue hb morphology . within each category",
    ", we also sort the clusters by the mean @xmath33 color of the 10 bluest hb stars in each cluster , after the cluster hb has been aligned to that of ngc  2808 ( otherwise it would depend upon both hb morphology and extinction ) .",
    "the choice of sorting metric is arbitrary , but our chosen metric is more useful than other obvious choices , such as the color of the single bluest star ( which is hampered by outliers ) or the mean color of the entire hb ( which is affected by strongly bimodal hb distributions ) . of the 52 clusters compared to ngc  2808 , 17 do not host sufficiently blue hb stars to characterize the three hb discontinuities blueward of the rr  lyrae instability strip . of the remaining 36 clusters , all but two ( ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 ) exhibit excellent agreement with the discontinuities observed in ngc  2808 , although the varying hb morphologies of these clusters do not always lend themselves to exploring each feature in detail .",
    "furthermore , the red clump in these clusters can vary significantly from that in ngc  2808 , as will be discussed later .",
    "our data do not provide sufficient time sampling to identify and characterize rr  lyrae stars .",
    "however , candidate rr  lyrae stars can be flagged by large exposure - to - exposure photometric variations . in figure  5 , we have excluded candidate rr  lyrae stars by omitting stars that exhibit photometric variations that significantly exceed those of other stars at the same magnitude ( at the level of 5@xmath34 or greater ) .",
    "a representative example of the photometric uncertainty is indicated by an error bar in the upper right - hand corner of each panel .",
    "because the rr  lyrae instability strip is redder than the discontinuities we explore in this paper , the exclusions do not affect our analysis , but avoid cluttering the ccp with variable stars sampled at random phases .                                _ category 1 : _ there are 9 clusters dominated by red clump stars ( ngc  6366 , ngc  6838 , ngc  6496 , ngc  6304 , ngc  6652 , ngc  6637 , ngc  6352 , ngc  5927 , and ngc  6624 ) .",

    "for some of these clusters , the statistics are poor , with only one or two blue - hook stars , but we stress that the presence of blue - hook stars is not simply a matter of sampling enough stellar mass to find a relatively rare evolutionary phase .",

    ", the shift in this feature implies that the onset for radiative levitation occurs at hotter effective temperature than the onset in other clusters , even after one accounts for the composition effects demonstrated in figure  4 .            to quantify this shift , in figure  6 we compare the photometry of four clusters ( ngc  2808 , ngc  6715 , ngc  6388 , and ngc  6441 ) to theoretical zahb distributions from brown et al .",

    "is more significant than that in the model .",
    "this may be due to the fact that the stars in these clusters were born at much higher metallicity than ngc  2808 , such that a simulation of radiative levitation would require a metallicity exceeding [ fe / h ]  =  0.5 .",
    "of course , our use of [ fe / h ]  =  0.5 synthetic spectra is only a crude approximation of the actual interplay between gravitational settling and radiative levitation in the stellar atmospheres , which produces large element - to - element variations .",

    "nonetheless , a transition temperature of 20,000  k is consistent with the observed m - jump in each cluster .",
    "for ngc  2808 and ngc  6715 , the temperature of the g - jump is close to the @xmath111,500  k temperature reported at the time of its original discovery ( grundahl et al .",

    "in contrast , the g - jump occurs at @xmath114,000  k in ngc  6388 and @xmath113,500  k in ngc  6441 , although given the small number of stars in the vicinity of the ngc  6441 g - jump , this value is uncertain at the level of a few hundred degrees .",
    "although the models in figure  6 employ metallicities appropriate for each cluster , these clusters exhibit variations in he enhancement along the hb , and the assumed @xmath13 has a small but non - negligible effect on the alignment of the models to the data ( see figure 4 ) . for this reason , in figure  7 we also characterize the effective temperatures of the discontinuities using zahb models representing sub - populations with strong he enhancement ( @xmath28  =  0.17 ) .",
    "the temperature determinations shown in figures  6 and 7 bracket the possibilities in each cluster .",
    "even if one tries to minimize the temperature distinctions in the g - jump for each cluster , by assuming the coolest estimates for the metal - rich clusters ( ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 ) and the hottest estimates for the clusters at lower metallicity ( ngc  2808 and ngc  6715 ) , the metal - rich clusters have g - jump temperatures at least 1,100  k hotter than those in the other clusters .",
    "figures  6 and 7 simulate the effects of radiative levitation in bhb stars by assuming a super - solar metallicity between the g - jump and m - jump .",

    "there are few metallicity measurements in globular clusters for ehb stars ( i.e. , at @xmath45  k ) , although brown et al .",
    "( 2012 ) found that some ( but not all ) of these stars in ngc  2808 exhibited super - solar fe abundances .",

    "( 2010 ) found that the fe enhancement in sdb stars hotter than 20,000  k is similar to that in the bhb population of globular clusters .",
    "furthermore , blueward of the g - jump , the enhancement of atmospheric metals is accompanied by a corresponding depletion in atmospheric he . in @xmath0  cen",
    ", this he depletion continues at temperatures well past 20,000  k ; in fact , the depletion continues until @xmath46  32,000  k , where the blue - hook stars exhibit atmospheres greatly enhanced in he ( moehler et al .",

    "besides this evidence , we can demonstrate with our own data that the m - jump can not be induced by the restoration of normal atmospheric abundances at temperatures above 20,000  k. in figure  8 , we show the same data and models that appeared in figures  6 and 7 , but now the ordinate uses @xmath47 , similar to the @xmath7 band employed by grundahl et al .",

    "it is impossible to disentangle these complexities using broad - band photometry .",
    "however , the purpose of the comparison here is to demonstrate the qualitative effects of radiative levitation in the atmosphere ( and the effects of he abundance in the stellar structure models , which will be discussed below ) .",
    "the onset of radiative levitation blueward of @xmath48  mag causes an upward jump in the @xmath47 photometry , such that the sense of the shift is the same in the model and the data .",
    "however , the cessation of radiative levitation blueward of @xmath49  mag causes a downward shift in the model , in contrast to the data .",
    "thus , the onset of radiative levitation explains the g - jump in both the ccp ( figures  6 and 7 ) and the cmd ( figure  8) , but the cessation of radiative levitation does not simultaneously reproduce the behavior of the m - jump in both diagrams .",
    "although a discussion of the red clump morphology in these clusters is beyond the scope of the current paper , we note some clusters exhibit red clump distributions in the ccp ( figure  5 ) that are distinct from that of ngc  2808",
    ". the distinction can be modest ( e.g. , ngc  5286 and ngc  5904 ) or severe ( e.g. , ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 ) , and is likely driven by metallicity effects in the reddest hb stars .",
    "however , even if we calculate zahb distributions at the appropriate metallicity for ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 , there is a significant mismatch between the models and data in figures  6 and 7 .",
    "these stars are as cool as those on the ms , where the sensitivity of the @xmath50 index to cno abundances makes it a useful diagnostic in the exploration of multiple populations ( see milone et al .",
    "the distortions of the red clump here may be related to the distinct ms morphologies of these two metal - rich clusters .",
    "bellini et al .",
    "( 2013b ) demonstrated that the ms of ngc  6441 is clearly split into two branches , while that of ngc  6388 is broadened but not split .",
    "they hypothesized that the second generation of stars in each cluster has a similarly enhanced he abundance but distinct cno abundances .",
    "those cno variations may explain why the two clusters exhibit distinct red clump morphologies in figures  6 and 7 . the predicted morphology of hb evolutionary tracks with cno - enhanced mixtures ( pietrinferni et al",
    ".  2009 ) seems to be consistent with this possibility ( see also the optical analysis of ngc  1851 by gratton et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "the g - jump is associated with a sharp increase in atmospheric metallicity , decrease in atmospheric he , and decrease in stellar rotation .",
    "we can now add that the g - jump is almost universally consistent in effective temperature , with the notable exceptions of ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 .",
    "the most likely reason for the increased temperature of the g - jump in ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 is that the bhb stars in these two metal - rich clusters are significantly enhanced in he , compared to bhb stars in relatively metal - poor clusters ; at higher metallicities , a larger he abundance is needed to populate the bhb .",
    "as mentioned previously , all globular clusters appear to exhibit sub - populations with distinct chemical compositions , but the phenomenon is strongest in massive globular clusters , where there exist sub - populations enhanced in he up to @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ; see piotto et al .",
    "2015 and references therein ) .",
    "at a fixed age , the ms turnoff mass decreases as he increases , and thus for a given amount of rgb mass loss , ms stars at higher @xmath13 tend to produce hb stars of lower mass and higher effective temperature .",
    "he enhancement also affects the hb luminosity . on the red clump and bhb , he - enhanced stars are brighter than normal , due to the larger energy output of their hydrogen shells that results from their lower envelope opacity and higher envelope mean molecular weight ( see , e.g. , sweigart 1987 ) . in contrast , on the ehb ,",
    "he - enhanced stars are fainter than normal , since they have smaller he core masses ( see , e.g. , sweigart & gross 1978 ) and insufficient envelope masses to support an active hydrogen shell ( valcarce et al .",

    "however , we know that massive clusters tend to host significant ehb populations associated with he - enriched populations ( see milone et al",
    ".  2014 ) .",
    "this is true in ngc  2808 ( @xmath54  mag ; harris 1996 ) , which hosts sub - populations with varying amounts of he enhancement ( up to @xmath51 ; dantona et al .",

    "another example of these effects can be seen in the comparison of m3 and m13 , two intermediate - metallicity clusters with distinct hb morphology that can be traced to he enhancement ( @xmath550.04 ) in m13 ( dalessandro et al .",

    "alternatively , the g - jump in most clusters could be due to the h convection zone .",
    "in this view , the g - jump remains at constant effective temperature in most clusters because the h convection is insensitive to @xmath13 .",

    "the temperatures observed for the g - jump do not exactly coincide with the transitions in the modeled convection zones , even if the behavior is qualitatively consistent .",

    ", we note that michaud et al .",
    "( 2011 ) reproduce the g - jump at 11,500  k by invoking a fully mixed region near the surface of the star , with a mass 10@xmath68  @xmath69 , possibly driven by turbulence or mass loss .",
    "another complication concerns the direction of the hb evolution beyond the zahb . as known since the work of sweigart & gross ( 1976 ) , bhb stars with normal he abundances can slowly evolve redward toward cooler effective temperatures , especially at low to intermediate metallicities .",
    "however , when their he enhancement is @xmath62 , the hb stars in the vicinity of the g - jump can rapidly evolve blueward from temperatures cooler than 11,500  k to temperatures near 15,000  k. depending upon the relative timescales of the various factors at work ( surface convection , turbulence , mass loss , radiative levitation , gravitational settling ) , the distinct evolutionary paths for high-@xmath13 stars may also push the g - jump toward higher effective temperatures in clusters like ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 .",
    "an exploration of these effects is currently underway ( tailo et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "as noted previously , the m - jump can not be due to a simple disruption of radiative levitation at temperatures hotter than 20,000  k. looking at figure  9 , it is worth noting that the convection zone begins to encroach upon the surface near this temperature , and the behavior is independent of he abundance . it may be a coincidence that the m - jump is also independent of he abundance , even in the two clusters exhibiting a hotter g - jump ( ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 ) , but we speculate that the m - jump may be associated with the convection zone .",
    "using uv and blue photometry for 53 galactic globular clusters , we have shown that the discontinuities in their hb distributions are remarkably consistent .",
    "globular clusters are now known to host complex populations with variations in chemical composition , but these hb discontinuities reflect universal transitions in atmospheric phenomena , and not abundance distinctions in their ms progenitors .",
    "that said , the effective temperature for one of these discontinuities , the g - jump , is @xmath11,0002,000  k hotter in ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 .",
    "this shift is likely due to the fact that these two clusters host bhb stars greatly enhanced in he ( @xmath52 ) , which affects the behavior of the convective zone and its role in disrupting radiative levitation .",
    "although the complexity of globular cluster populations was originally recognized in the most massive globular clusters , its ubiquity became more apparent with appropriate photometry .",
    "the history of blue - hook stars is following a similar path .",
    "this is not because massive clusters provide more chances to find a star following a relatively rare evolutionary avenue ; instead , these clusters host sub - populations significantly enhanced in he , which leads to a hotter hb morphology . while blue - hook stars comprise a tiny fraction of the population in any globular cluster , we have shown that these products of extreme mass loss can be found in most of the bright globular clusters .",
    "the census of clusters hosting blue - hook stars has increased to 23 , with nearly all of them residing in the brighter half of the galaxy s globular cluster system .",
