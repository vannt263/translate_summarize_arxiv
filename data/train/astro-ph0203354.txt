    "the soft x - ray emission - line spectrum of ne - like iron ( fe@xmath0 , ) is one of the most extensively investigated spectroscopic systems in astrophysics .",
    "owing to the high abundance of fe and to the closed electronic shell structure of the ne - like ground configuration 2s@xmath82p@xmath9 , fe@xmath0 forms over a wide range of temperatures ( @xmath10 = 100 - 1000  ev ) .",
    "hence , many spectra of hot astrophysical objects exhibit prominent fe@xmath0 lines . a better understanding of the spectrum of fe@xmath0 is even more important in light of the multitude of high - resolution x - ray spectra obtained with the grating spectrometers on board the _ chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _  observatories .",
    "the brightest lines of fe@xmath0 in the x - rays arise from the 2p-3d and 2p-3s transitions , which appear roughly at 15 and 17   , respectively .",
    "the analysis of x - ray spectra emitted during solar flares has shown the potential of these lines to serve as diagnostic tools , mainly for the diagnostics of electron temperature @xcite , electron density , and elemental abundances @xcite .",
    "however , the usefulness of the fe@xmath0 lines has been hampered by two persistent problems , which emerge from extensive comparisons between observations , laboratory measurements , and theoretical models .",
    "the first is that the strongest line at 15.01    arising from the 2p@xmath9 @xmath11s@xmath12 - 2p@xmath133d @xmath11p@xmath14 transition appears to be significantly weaker than its predicted relative intensity . in particular",
    ", the intensity ratio of that line to the 2p@xmath9 @xmath11s@xmath12 - 2p@xmath133d @xmath15d@xmath14 line at 15.26   , commonly labeled @xmath16 @xcite , is consistently lower than the ratio calculated for a wide range of plasma parameters .",
    "this has led to the suggestion that the high oscillator - strength line at 15.01    is quenched by resonant scattering @xcite .",
    "the continuing discrepancies between observations and theory have prompted several laboratory studies in which the plasma elemental composition , and to a large extent also the plasma conditions , can be controlled . in particular , the ebit ( electron beam ion trap ) device offers the opportunity to isolate nearly entirely the fe@xmath0 ions from neighboring charge states and to measure their atomic properties with high accuracy .",
    "the ebit measurements of @xcite first supported the claim that the line at 15.01    is affected by resonance scattering although to a lesser extent than originally believed .",
    "however , as suggested by behar , cottam , & kahn ( 2001a ) and later demonstrated in an ebit measurement @xcite , a satellite line of fe@xmath17 that coincides in wavelength and blends with the 15.26    line can explain most of the observed @xmath16 ratios without needing to invoke resonant scattering .",
    "this conclusion is also supported by measurements in the plt tokamak @xcite .",
    "the second problem with the fe@xmath0 lines is the overall intensities of the 2p-3s lines , which often appear enhanced relative to theoretical predictions , when compared with the intensities of the 2p-3d lines .",
    "this has led to suggestions that 2p inner - shell ionization of na - like fe@xmath17 ( ground configuration 2p@xmath93s ) might contribute to the population of the 2p@xmath133s levels @xcite .",
    "other explanations suggested possible contributions to these level populations from dielectronic recombination ( dr ) of f - like fe@xmath4 ( 2p@xmath13 ) followed by radiative cascades @xcite .",
    "an ebit measurement that focused on the overall intensity ratio of the 2p-3s lines relative to the 2p-3d lines @xcite yielded a ratio that generally agrees with theoretical predictions , but is significantly lower than most astrophysical measurements .",
    "this further suggested that ionization and recombination processes , which are by and large absent from ebit experiments and are also neglected in the theoretical models , play an important role in producing the fe@xmath0 lines in cosmic sources .",
    "the recent high - resolution observations of stellar coronae with _",
    "chandra _",
    "@xcite and _ xmm - newton",
    "_  @xcite produced a variety of 2p-3s / 2p-3d intensity ratios .",
    "however , none of the observed ratios are fully consistent with existing theoretical models , further demonstrating that the above problems occur for a wide range of coronal sources .",
    "additionally , thanks to the high dispersion and efficiency of the reflection grating spectrometer ( rgs ) on board _ xmm - newton _ , fe@xmath0 line spectra can now be obtained not only for stellar coronae ( point sources ) , but also for extended sources . in observations of supernova remnants @xcite and elliptical galaxies @xcite , the relative fe@xmath0 line intensities show the same discrepancies with available models .",
    "in fact , for the analysis of the x - ray spectrum of ngc 4636 , @xcite were required to invoke the empirical capella spectrum into their model , because even the most updated theoretical models could not reproduce the observed emission .",
    "the pervasive discrepancies between the calculated spectra and those measured for a wide variety of hot astrophysical sources strongly suggest that the problems lie in the shortcomings of the atomic models for line formation rather than in the uncertainties associated with the astrophysical environments .    in an effort to improve the existing atomic models , which neglect atomic processes that involve neighboring ions ,",
    "we construct a 3-ion collisional - radiative model that includes levels of f - like , ne - like , and na - like fe .",
    "such a model allows one to consider collisional excitations as well as the effect of recombination and ionization simultaneously .",
    "the main drawback of a naive , all - inclusive 3-ion model , in which rate equations for the three ionization states are solved simultaneously , is that the fractional ion abundances , which self - consistently result from the model , would be clearly erroneous . in order to obtain correct results for the ionization balance in a collisional - radiative model for a wide range of temperatures",
    ", one would have to include more than three ionization states , as well as numerous levels for each charge state ( to adequately account for dr ) , which makes this approach impractical .",
    "since we are interested in the line spectrum and not the ionization balance , we can circumvent this difficulty by adopting the approach formerly used in @xcite , by which an independent ionization balance is imposed on the level - by - level , multi - ion model .",
    "the details of the current 3-ion method are given in the following section (  [ sec : method ] ) . in ",
    "[ sec : results ] , we give the results of the 3-ion model for the line - emission of fe@xmath0 and compare them with results obtained with a basic , single - ion model typical of those that have been used until now .",
    "collisionally ionized , astrophysical plasmas are characterized by relatively high temperatures and low densities . the most common atomic model used to describe the line emission from a particular ionic species ( say fe@xmath0 ) under these conditions includes only electron impact excitations from the ground state and subsequent radiative decays , either directly to the ground state or via cascades . in the present work ,",
    "we wish to extend this standard model and take into account also atomic processes involving neighboring ionization states . specifically , we include dielectronic and radiative recombination from f - like fe@xmath4 , inner - shell ionization from na - like fe@xmath17 , and resonant excitation through doubly - excited levels of fe@xmath17 ( i.e. , dielectronic capture followed by autoionization to excited levels ) .",
    "we assume the plasma is optically thin and collisionally ionized , i.e. , photoexcitation and photoionization are unimportant . assuming that the free electron energy distribution is maxwellian , corresponding to an electron temperature @xmath18 , the general set of rate equations for the density ( population ) @xmath19 of an ion with charge @xmath20 in a level @xmath21 in a steady state can be written as : @xmath22+\\sum_{k > j}n_k^{q+}a_{kj}- \\nonumber \\\\ n_j^{q+}\\left\\ { n_e \\sum_{k\\ne j}\\left [ q_{jk}(t_e)+q_{jk}^{re}(t_e)\\right ] + \\sum_{k < j}a_{jk}+\\sum_{j''}a^a_{jj '' } \\right\\}+ \\nonumber \\\\ n_e\\left\\{\\sum_{j'}n^{(q-1)+}_{j'}s_{j'j}(t_e)+\\sum_{j''}n^{(q+1)+}_{j '' } \\left [ \\alpha^{dc}_{j''j}(t_e)+\\alpha^{rr}_{j''j}(t_e ) \\right ] \\right\\}- \\nonumber \\\\",

    "the terms @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively , represent the rate coefficients for direct and resonant ( re ) electron - impact excitation or de - excitation .",
    "the terms @xmath29 and @xmath30 denote the rate coefficients for spontaneous radiative decay and for autoionization , respectively .",
    "the terms @xmath31 stand for the rate coefficients for collisional ionization , and @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the rate coefficients for dielectronic capture and for radiative recombination , respectively .",
    "the electron density is denoted by @xmath34 .",
    "the entire set of equations that needs to be solved consists also of the appropriate rate equations for @xmath35 and @xmath36 , consistent with the atomic processes that appear in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rates ] ) . throughout this work ,",
    "we use @xmath37 = 16 .",
    "densities for ions other than the three considered are taken as zero . in order to obtain a unique solution , one of the rate equations in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rates ] ) is substituted by a normalization condition , such as @xmath38 , which leaves us with @xmath39 independent equations for the @xmath40 levels included in the model .    a straightforward solution for the set of equations ( [ eq : rates ] ) necessarily yields the ionization balance through the results for the level populations @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath36 . as argued above",
    ", this resulting ionization balance would clearly be wrong for most temperatures , as the set of equations consists of only three ionization states , and practically , an insufficient number of levels to determine the correct ionization balance . in order to avoid this error , the set of rate equations",
    "is solved by imposing the following constraints : @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 represent the relevant ion fractions , and are calculated independently . in other words , we impose the ionization balance and only seek for the consequential population distribution among the individual levels .",
    "we are primarily interested in levels @xmath21 of the ion with charge @xmath20 . in the coronal approximation , where the ions are essentially in their ground state , and in the absence of metastable levels",
    ", it is sufficient to apply the constraints only through the ground levels of the three charge states . moreover ,",
    "collisional transitions among excited levels can be neglected . for fe@xmath0",
    ", this approximation holds for @xmath47 @xmath48 . for the present study",
    ", we have adopted the fractional abundances calculated by @xcite .",
    "table [ tab : ionfractions ] presents the ion fractions of fe@xmath17 through fe@xmath4 for several chosen electron temperatures in the relevant range of 200 - 1000  ev .",
    "the last column in the table gives the combined fraction of these three ions as a function of temperature .",
    "these total values are provided in order to give an idea of the collective importance of these ions in astrophysical plasmas at each temperature .    for fe@xmath0",

    "the configurations 2s@xmath82p@xmath13 and 2s@xmath82p@xmath523@xmath1 are taken into account .",
    "finally , the ground configuration 2s@xmath82p@xmath93s of fe@xmath17 is also included .",
    "all of these configurations add up to 2111 levels .",
    "in fact , the inclusion of the re processes ( @xmath53 ) in the set of rate equations ( [ eq : rates ] ) is equivalent to including the doubly - excited configurations of fe@xmath17 .",
    "since we are not interested specifically in the population of the fe@xmath17 levels , we have incorporated the re rate coefficients from the literature ( instead of including all of the appropriate doubly - excited levels of fe@xmath17 ) , and by doing so , we significantly reduce the number of rate equations to be solved . the singly - excited configurations of fe@xmath0 up to @xmath50 = 7 have been shown to account for most of the radiative - cascades effects @xcite and are taken into account in all of our models .",
    "the fe@xmath0 doubly - excited configurations that are included here explicitly produce about 50% of the total dr effect in the entire 200  - 800  ev temperature range .",
    "the contribution of higher dr resonances is obtained by means of extrapolation based on the total dr rates published by @xcite . in order to account for the radiative recombination contribution onto high electronic shells with @xmath54  7 ,",
    "we have employed a hydrogenic extrapolation method .",
    "the solutions for the rate equations ( [ eq : rates ] ) , which are the normalized level populations @xmath55 , are used to obtain the line power @xmath56 , which is defined here by : @xmath57 subsequently , the line emissivity @xmath58 , which gives the total number of photons emitted in the plasma per unit time and per unit volume as a result of the radiative decay from level @xmath21 to level @xmath59 , can then be found by : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the iron elemental abundance and @xmath62 is the hydrogen density .",
    "the basic atomic quantities used in this work were generated by means of the multiconfiguration , relativistic hullac  ( hebrew university lawrence livermore atomic code ) computer package developed by @xcite .",
    "resonance excitation rates are not calculated explicitly , but incorporated from @xcite for the 2p@xmath9 to 2p@xmath133@xmath1 ( @xmath1 = s ,",
    "p ) excitations of fe@xmath0 . following those authors , resonant excitation to 2p@xmath133d levels",
    "is assumed to be unimportant due to their high energies and has been neglected .",
    "we have employed the model described above to calculate the fe@xmath0 level populations and line intensities for various temperatures in the range 200 - 1000  ev . in the following ,",
    "we focus our presentation on the results for the seven most intense fe@xmath0 lines , which fall in the range 13.5 - 17.5   .",
    "the corresponding transitions , their labels , and measured wavelengths ( @xmath63 ) from @xcite are given in table [ tab:7lines ] . since in optically thin plasma ,",
    "the relative intensities of these lines show negligible sensitivity to the electron density , the present results are valid for electron densities below 10@xmath64 @xmath48 .",
    "the calculated line powers [ defined in  [ sec : method ]  eq .",
    "( [ eq : linepower ] ) ] as a function of the electron temperature for the seven transitions listed in table [ tab:7lines ] are given in figs .",
    "[ f1 ] and [ f2 ] by the solid curves . for comparison",
    ", we also give the line powers calculated with a single - ion model , i.e. a model that takes into account only direct electron impact excitations and subsequent radiative decays .",
    "the data points in the plots throughout this paper mark the explicitly calculated values , while the curves represent a spline interpolation between these points .",
    "it can be seen from this comparison that the 2p-3s lines ( fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ) , as well as the weak 2p-3d line at 15.45    ( fig .",
    "[ f2 ] ) , are significantly affected by processes involving neighboring ions over a wide range of temperatures , while the two strong 2p-3d lines at 15.01 and 15.26   , as well as the 2s-3p line at 13.83   , are much less affected by these processes .",
    "in particular , the intensity of the strongest 2p-3d line at 15.01    is almost identical in the two types of models , while the intensity of the 2p-3s line at 17.10    roughly doubles when contributions from neighboring ionization states are considered .      in order to obtain an insight into the dramatic differences between the results of the 3-ion model and the single - ion model",
    ", we investigate the relative importance of each atomic process separately .",
    "this is done by running a sequence of 3-ion models , where in each run we turn off one of the atomic processes : resonant excitation ( re ) , dielectronic recombination ( dr ) , radiative recombination ( rr ) , or collisional ionization ( ci ) .",
    "the resulting line powers in each of these models are presented in table [ tab : contributions ] for several electron temperatures in the range 200  - 800  ev .",
    "the results obtained with a traditional single - ion model , which includes direct collisional excitation ( ce ) alone , are also given for comparison .",
    "the first column in the table indicates the electron temperature and the second column describes the model .",
    "the following columns give the line power for each of the seven lines .",
    "in general , it can be seen from table [ tab : contributions ] that among the additional atomic processes , which are included in the 3-ion model , re and dr are the most important .    at an electron temperature of 400  ev , the power of the 17.10  line , which is the most affected , receives contributions of 16% , 11% , 0.5% , and 3% from re , dr , rr , and ci , respectively , which together enhance the line by 47% compared with the value obtained when calculating direct ce alone . at 600  ev , where the absolute fe@xmath0 line powers are still very high ,",
    "the additional processes enhance the ce value for the 17.10    line by 57% , where re , dr , rr , and ci , respectively , produce 10% , 21.5% , 0.5% , and 2.5% of the total line power . the other 2p-3s lines at 16.78 and 17.05    are also enhanced by the non - ce processes , albeit to a somewhat lesser degree ( 20% - 30% ) . the main reason for this is dr , which preferentially populates the upper level of the 17.10    line .",
    "additionally , ci processes to that level are about twice as effective as ci to any other upper level of the 2@xmath1 - 3@xmath2 transitions .",
    "the weak 2p-3d line at 15.45    is also enhanced , mostly by dr ( re processes towards the 2p@xmath133d levels are neglected ) . at 600  ev",
    ", 13.5% of the 15.45    line power is due to dr .",
    "the trends of the various contributions with temperature are also interesting to note .",
    "the re effect is predominant at low temperatures .",
    "it represents about a third of the 2p-3s line powers at 200  ev , but declines rather sharply with temperature . at 800  ev it contributes less than 7% to the 2p-3s line powers .",
    "the effect of dr , on the other hand , is small at low temperatures , but increases dramatically as the temperature increases .",
    "the enhancement of the 2p-3s lines due to dr reaches almost 30% at 800  ev .",
    "these two opposing effects are a direct consequence of the strong variations in the fractional ionic abundances with temperature and the fact that the re effect is correlated with the fe@xmath0 abundance , while that of dr depends strictly on the fe@xmath4 abundance . as can be inferred from table  [ tab : ionfractions ] and from @xcite , the abundance of fe@xmath0 dominates at temperatures up to @xmath3400  ev , while that of fe@xmath4 peaks at @xmath3600  ev .",
    "interestingly , through most of the temperature range in which the fe@xmath0 line powers are relatively high , say 300 - 700  ev ( see figs .",
    "[ f1 ] and  [ f2 ] ) , both re and dr are important , which means neither can be neglected when accurate line powers are needed .",
    "recent unpublished calculations by @xcite claim that @xcite have underestimated the re rate coefficients . indeed , higher re rates would imply even a more pronounced enhancement to the line powers than demonstrated here , especially in the low temperature regime , where re is important .",
    "unfortunately , the absence of full level - by - level re rate coefficients in that paper precludes us from estimating this effect quantitatively .",
    "notwithstanding , the dr and ci enhancements calculated in this work are by and large independent of the re effect .",
    "it is important to distinguish between the dr enhancement of fe@xmath0 lines calculated in this work and the effect of fe@xmath17 dr satellite lines , which was traditionally incorporated in plasma models .",
    "the dr effect , which is discussed here , produces the exact same parent lines of fe@xmath0 ( i.e. , 2p@xmath133@xmath1 - 2p@xmath9 ) , by means of dr processes that populate the upper levels of these transitions ( e.g. , 2p@xmath523@xmath13@xmath2 - 2p@xmath133@xmath1 ) .",
    "this should not be confused with dr satellites emitted by lower charge states at slightly longer wavelengths ( e.g. , 2p@xmath133@xmath13@xmath2 - 2p@xmath93@xmath1 in fe@xmath17 ) .",
    "the latter , in many cases , can be resolved from the parent lines by high - resolution spectrometers .",
    "note , however , that the radiative decays ( 2p@xmath523@xmath13@xmath2 - 2p@xmath133@xmath2 ) that populate the upper levels of the fe@xmath0 lines , are in fact associated with dr satellites of fe@xmath4 .",
    "this line emission is explicitly included in our calculations and is illustrated in the spectra shown below in  [ sec : spectra ] .",
    "the large impact of the additional atomic processes considered in the 3-ion model on some of the line intensities directly affects the line ratios and , thus , the diagnostic applications of the fe@xmath0 system . in figs .  [ f3 ] - [ f5 ] , we present the most interesting line intensities normalized in most cases to the 2p-3d line at 15.01  , which is the strongest fe@xmath0 line at most temperatures and also the least affected by the additional processes ( see table [ tab : contributions ] ) .",
    "as in figs .  [ f1 ] and [ f2 ] , the solid curves represent the results of the ( complete ) 3-ion model and the dotted curves represent the single - ion model .",
    "the most pronounced effect is found for the ratios involving the 2p-3s lines in fig .",
    "since the spectral resolution of contemporary spectrometers , such as the reflection grating spectrometer ( rgs ) aboard _ xmm - newton _  and the low energy transmission grating spectrometer ( letgs ) aboard _ chandra _ , is hardly sufficient to resolve the two 2p-3s lines at 17.10 and 17.05   , we also show the corresponding curve for the summed intensities of these two lines .",
    "the ratio involving the third 2p-3s line at 16.78  is given separately in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] to avoid overcrowding the plot .",
    "the calculated ratios shown in fig .  [ f3 ] shed new light on the discrepancy as yet between the observed and calculated values for the ratio of the 17.10    and 17.05    lines to the line at 15.01   . using the single - ion model , one obtains ( in the relevant temperature range ) a maximum value of 1.2 for the ratio ( i@xmath5  + i@xmath65 )  / i@xmath7 , while the observed ratios from various coronal sources , including many observations of the sun , are in the range of @xmath3  1.5 - 2.6 .",
    "a list of various measured ratios for these lines is presented in table [ tab : ratios ] .",
    "the inclusion of re , dr , and ci processes in the calculations by means of the 3-ion model yields values of @xmath3  1.4 - 1.9 for this ratio at temperatures of 200  ev and higher , where fe@xmath0 forms predominantly .",
    "even higher values , which are observed mostly in active regions on the sun can be attained for this ratio at lower temperatures , which are realistic for these environments . in the special case of spatially resolved observations of the sun ,",
    "resonant scattering of the 15.01  line is also plausible . alternatively",
    ", non - equilibrium ionization ( nei ) conditions can also play a role in enhancing the 2p-3s  / 2p-3d ratios .",
    "in particular , nei conditions make the effects of ionization and recombination on line formation more pronounced than in equilibrium and would tend to enhance the 2p-3s lines even further . in conclusion",
    ", the major part of the observed ratios can be explained in terms of the 3-ion coronal - equilibrium model . for the abnormally high ratios observed mostly in the sun , resonant scattering and nei are also plausible .",
    "the present results can shed more light on the intepretation of laboratory measurements .",
    "@xcite found for the 2p-3s / 2p-3d ratios good agreement between their ebit measurements and simple , single - ion models . in the ebit experiment ,",
    "the selectivity of the ionic charge fe@xmath0 is supposed to be very high and the presence of fe@xmath17 and fe@xmath4 can therefore be minimized .",
    "in addition , @xcite used a relatively high - energy ( @xmath31  kev ) electron beam . under such conditions ,",
    "the contributions of re , dr , and ci are expected to be very small , and a single - ion ce model could therefore be adequate for reproducing the experimental results .",
    "however , in a very recent ebit experiment , also with a high - energy beam ( @xmath660.8  kev ) , @xcite measure 2p-3s / 2p-3d ratios that are almost a factor of 2 higher than those measured by @xcite .",
    "these recent results could imply that even the basic ce models may be inadequate , or that high - lying resonances do contribute to re even at these high energies , or a combination thereof . in any event",
    ", the effects of the additional processes , which are put forward in this work , are relevant to all plasmas in collisional equilibrium and as such , they ubiquitously enhance the ce ( + additional re ) rates measured with ebit .",
    "another indication for additional processes in plasma sources that are not present in ebit experiments comes from the relative intensities of the 17.05 and 17.10    lines . in the ebit measurements of @xcite",
    "the line at 17.05    is significantly stronger than the line at 17.10   , while in many astrophysical observations the two lines have comparable intensities .",
    "this difference is consistent with our results as presented in table [ tab : contributions ] , where dr enhances the 17.10    line much more than it does the 17.05  line .    as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] , for @xmath67  600  ev , the newly calculated 2p-3s  / 2p-3d ratios are more sensitive to the electron temperature than those calculated with the single - ion model , while at higher temperatures , the little sensitivity that existed in the single - ion model is , in fact , lost in the new model . in particular , the major role played by the re processes at low temperatures significantly increases the temperature sensitivity in this regime .",
    "the ( i@xmath5  + i@xmath6 )  / i@xmath7 ratio decreases from 1.9 to 1.4 from 200 to 600  ev . the temperature sensitivity of these ratios diminishes rapidly thereafter , but in any case the absolute power of these lines drops sharply beyond 600  ev ( see figs .  [ f1 ] and [ f2 ] ) .",
    "therefore , in multi - temperature sources often unresolved in astrophysical observations , the high - temperature contribution to the integrated spectrum of fe@xmath0 would be very small . in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] , one can see that the values obtained for the ratio",
    "i@xmath7  / i@xmath68 in the 3-ion model are not very different ( @xmath69  3% ) than the single - ion model values in the entire temperature range . we note that our single - ion calculations for the ratio i@xmath7  / i@xmath68 yield a value of 3.4 .",
    "the present model includes configurations up to @xmath50=7 .",
    "the inclusion of even higher configurations would have only a negligible effect on the ratio .",
    "a value of 3.4 is about 12% higher than the value measured by @xcite in ebit with a monoenergetic beam at 1.15  kev , and about 15% higher than the ebit ratio measured by @xcite with a beam energy of 0.9  kev .",
    "the ebit values are associated with errors of about 5% .",
    "both measurements are just within the 15% accuracy range expected from the ce rate coefficients produced by the hullac  code for this kind of atomic system .",
    "the ratio of the weak 2p-3d line at 15.45    to the 2p-3d resonance line at 15.01    is also enhanced , albeit to a lesser extent than the 2p-3s lines , as can be seen in fig .",
    "the 2s-3p line at 13.83    is only very slightly affected by the additional processes ( fig .",
    "the 15.45    line is enhanced for the most part by dr , while the effects of ci and rr are very small .",
    "the dr effect increases with temperature due to the increase in the abundance of fe@xmath4 . the ci effect , on the other hand , depends both on the ci rate coefficients that increase with temperature , but also on the decreasing fe@xmath17 abundance . since at low temperatures ,",
    "the rate coefficients for inner - shell ionization ( ci ) are very small while the fe@xmath17 abundance is high and vice versa at high temperatures , the ci effect is supressed in ionization equilibrium conditions throughout the relevant temperature range . in nei",
    ", however , the ci effect could be more pronounced .",
    "note that following @xcite , re processes to 2p@xmath133d levels are neglected in our model .",
    "however , according to @xcite , re processes do , in fact , populate the upper level of the 15.45    line and enhance this ratio to values of 0.08 and higher .",
    "on the other hand , the measurements of @xcite show a value of 0.04 for this ratio , which is totally consistent with the present results .",
    "either way , the dr effect on this ratio demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ f5 ] remains .",
    "admittedly , the ratios in fig .",
    "[ f5 ] could be rather hard to use for diagnostics due to their weakness in most sources .",
    "however , in bright sources , such as capella for instance , the 13.83    line could be intense enough to provide useful temperature diagnostics @xcite .",
    "we point out that the present line ratios have been compared with those calculated by gu ( private communications ) using a similar model based on the fac atomic code @xcite .",
    "the overall 2p-3s  / 2p-3d intensity ratios obtained with the two codes agree to within 1% .",
    "the agreement between ratios for individual lines is @xmath35% .      as seen in ",
    "[ sec : mechanisms ] and  [ sec : ratios ] , additional processes to direct collisional excitation ( ce ) have a major role in producing the soft x - ray lines of fe@xmath0 .",
    "in order to provide a more visual illustration of the overall effect on the spectrum , total and partial synthetic spectra calculated for 400  ev are presented in fig .",
    "the upper trace in the figure gives the total spectrum , while the lower trace shows the explicit contribution of the ce processes alone .",
    "the middle trace represents the complementary contribution of non - ce processes .",
    "the different plots in fig .",
    "[ f6 ] are all on the same scale .",
    "the spectra clearly show the importance of the non - ce processes to the 2p-3s lines at @xmath3  17   .",
    "the 2p-3d lines ( @xmath3  15   ) are almost unaffected by these mechanisms .",
    "the spectra also include lines of fe@xmath4 around 14.2    ( 2p-3d ) and 16    ( 2p-3s ) , which are produced self consistently by the model and are rather weak at 400  ev .",
    "the line intensities for fe@xmath4 , however , should be viewed with caution , since the model for fe@xmath4 is limited .",
    "particularly , dr processes from fe@xmath70 are not taken into account .",
    "additionally , the model does not include the dr satellite lines of fe@xmath17 and therefore these are absent from the plots in fig .",
    "[ f6 ] . at 400  ev",
    ", these dr satellites are expected to produce weak line emission mostly around 15.26   , as mentioned above in  1 .",
    "we have constructed a 3-ion model to account for ionization and recombination processes that produce the fe@xmath0 emission lines , in addition to the collisional and radiative processes among fe@xmath0 levels .",
    "it is shown that recombination ( dr and rr ) , inner - shell ionization ( ci ) , and resonant excitation ( re ) processes , contribute significantly to the line powers and can resolve the existing discrepancies between observations and previous calculations within the framework of a coronal equilibrium model . among the additional processes considered , re and dr ( of fe@xmath4 )",
    "are found to play a major role in producing the fe@xmath0 lines .",
    "the present calculations reproduce the systematically high values observed for the 2p-3s / 2p-3d intensity ratios in many astrophysical sources . only abnormally high ratios observed mostly on the sun may still require one to invoke resonant scattering of the 15.01    line , or less likely transient conditions that depart from ionization equilibrium . since non - equilibrium conditions are not required to explain most of the observed ratios , we defer the study of those cases to future work .",
    "the fact that recombination and ionization are important makes the present predictions dependent upon the ionization balance of fe@xmath17 - fe@xmath4 .",
    "we expect similar effects of inner - shell ionization and of recombination on the 2@xmath1 - 3@xmath2 lines to be present in more highly ionized systems ( fe@xmath4 - fe@xmath71 ) as well",
    ". however , a reliable assessment of this effect will require detailed models similar to the one employed here .",
    "the results of the present , elaborate , 3-ion model should also be important for analyzing the intensities of other lines that arise from the decay of the 2p@xmath723@xmath1 levels , i.e. , 3@xmath1 - 3@xmath2 transitions . in the case of fe@xmath0 , these transitions fall in the euv range . in lighter ne - like ions ,",
    "these 3@xmath1 - 3@xmath2 transitions are clearly observed in the uv solar spectra obtained by the solar ultraviolet measurements of emitted radiation ( sumer ) spectrometer on board the soho satellite .",
    "eb acknowledges ongoing work and many useful discussions with steven kahn on the complexity of the line intensity patterns of fe@xmath0 and their manifestation in x - ray observations .",
    "we are grateful to ming feng gu for useful comparisons of the present results with some of his own calculations .",
