    "a ginga observation ( remillard et al . 1991 ) showed an increase of the x - ray flux by 67% in 3 minutes , implying that the apparent luminosity must be enhanced by relativistic beaming .",
    "further x - ray observations with different satellites have confirmed the steep x - ray spectrum and high luminosity of this source , but no more relativistic flares have been presented in the literature .",

    "the conversion to luminosities in the 0.22.4 kev energy band was performed using pimms , assuming galactic absorption (= @xmath19 , dickey & lockman 1990 ) and a power law spectral model with photon index ranging between 2.1 ( remillard et al . 1991 ) and 3.1 ( brinkmann et al .",
    "however , possible deviations from a single power law or long term spectral changes can lead to systematic uncertainties .",
    "the measured soft x - ray spectrum is rather steep and the medium energy power laws are considerably flatter , but the sparse data do not allow determination of whether the source shows spectral steepening towards lower energies or whether long term spectral changes occur during intensity variations .",
    "the luminosities were calculated by assuming a friedman cosmology with @xmath20 , @xmath21 and isotropic emission .",
    "in this paper we report the results of two rosat hri observation campaigns taken five months apart ( in november 1997 and april 1998 ) and the survey pspc data ( september 1990 ) , with the purpose to check whether the strong x - ray variability is persistent and whether a nearby source contributes to the x - ray flux . in section 2",

    "the data analysis was performed using standard routines within the exsas environment ( zimmermann et al .",
    "the count rates ( vignetting and dead time corrected ) quoted in table 2 , as well as the light curves , were obtained by extracting photons from a circle with 150  radius around the source center and subtracting a background from a source - free region . in order to reduce the uncertainties from an extrapolation of a steep power law spectrum to low energies ( 0.10.2 kev ) where the galactic absorption is important , we base our discussion on the luminosities in the 0.22.4 kev band . as a result",

    "1997 ) , that might imply a contribution to the x - ray flux from a nearby source . to perform a spatial analysis we used all the april 1998 observations . a contour plot of the x - ray emission overlaid onto the optical image is shown in fig .",
    "the photons were binned in 2@xmath362  pixels and smoothed with a gaussian with @xmath37 .",
    "the surface brightness profile is well fitted by the original hri psf - model convolved with an additional gaussian to allow for the known smearing of the psf by residual wobble motion , which can vary between different observations ( morse 1994 ) .",
    "the equatorial coordinates of the centroid in the hri image , computed from a gaussian fit to the spatial distribution , are ra(2000)=@xmath38 , dec(2000)=@xmath39 , in good agreement with the optical position , taking into account that the internal hri position error is of the order of 5 .",
    "the only other x - ray source visible in the field of view is in the south - west of pks  0558504 at the position ra(2000)=@xmath40 , dec(2000)=@xmath41 , with a mean count rate of 0.0021 @xmath42 , which corresponds to a flux of @xmath43 ( assuming galactic absorption and a power law spectral model with @xmath44 ) .",

    "this only additional x - ray source in the hri field of view is nearly a factor 1000 fainter than pks  0558504 , and no other strong x - ray source is found in the rosat survey within a radius of 2@xmath46 .",
    "therefore contributions from a previously unknown nearby source to the high luminosity and the strong variability can be ruled out .",
    "on the basis of the luminosities quoted in tab . 1 , no long - term x - ray variability by more than a factor of 4 has been seen from pks  0558504 .",
    "recent sax and rxte observations seem to confirm this picture ( a. comastri and k. leighly , private communication ) . however , spectral variations and the extrapolation of steep power law spectrum to low energies can lead to uncertain luminosities , as pointed out by brandt et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .",
    "more reliable results can be obtained by comparing data from the same instrument .",
    "for instance , by comparing the mean count rates of the two hri observations taken five months apart , we find an increase of the count rates by a factor 2.4 , corresponding to a luminosity variation of @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) .    in fig .",
    "2 we show the total light curve for pks  0558504 during april 1998 .",
    "the data points are binned into bins of 400 s , in order to avoid spurious count rate variations due to the rosat wobble . to characterize quantitatively the variability in the light curve",
    ", we calculated the excess variance ( nandra et al .",
    "1997 ) , @xmath49 . at first sight",
    "the most extreme count rate variation seems to occur during april 23 and 24 , with @xmath50 @xmath51 , corresponding to @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) , calculated by performing a linear least square fit to that part of the light curve .",
    "however , if we consider the steep increase of the count rate on april 24 only , we obtain an even more extreme value of @xmath54 , leading to @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "this value can be used to estimate the lower limit of the radiative efficiency : @xmath57 ( fabian 1979 ) .",
    "straightforward application of the limit gives @xmath58 ( @xmath59 for the 0.12.4 kev energy band ) , which exceeds the theoretical maximum for accretion onto a schwarzschild black hole , but not onto a maximally rotating kerr black hole .",
    "the extremely high efficiency , @xmath60 , derived from the ginga 210 kev luminosities ( remillard et al . 1991 ) however , strongly indicates that some approximations used in the calculation of the efficiency limit must be relaxed , allowing uniform radiation release and relativistic effects in the vicinity of the black hole ( e.g. brandt et al .",

    "pks  0558504 was observed in the rosat all - sky survey between 1990 september 8 ( 10:58:02 ut ) and 1990 september 14 ( 22:14:44 ut ) , with an effective exposure of 1036 s and an average count rate of @xmath61 . the light curve , shown in fig .",

    "the values derived for the radiative efficiency are similar : @xmath68 for the 0.22.4 kev band and @xmath69 for the 0.12.4 kev band .",
    "the spectrum can be fit with a single power law with photon index @xmath70 and free absorption of @xmath71@xmath72 , in excellent agreement with the galactic value .",
    "the residuals of this fit , given in fig .",
    "[ figure : fitspec ] , do not give strong evidence for deviations from a simple power law although there are indications at @xmath73kev for some spectral changes . with these parameters",
    "the resulting unabsorbed fluxes during the survey observations are @xmath74 and @xmath75 , for the 0.22.4 kev and 0.12.4 kev energy bands , respectively , corresponding to @xmath76 and @xmath77 .    for several",
    "agn , light curves with large amplitude flares have been interpreted as indication for non - linear processes ( green 1993 , boller et al .",
    "1997 , leighly & obrien 1997 ) .",
    "given that the april 1998 light curve of pks  0558504 presents at least two large flares , we searched for non - gaussianity ( and possibly for non - linearity ; see leighly 1999a for a detailed discussion ) , by adopting the green ( 1993 ) method : a time series is non - gaussian if the ratio of its standard deviation to its mean is larger than unity",
    ". using the data points in fig .",
    "2 we find that the unweighted mean count rate is 1.61 @xmath42 and the standard deviation 0.39 @xmath42 ( @xmath78 ) . as a result",
    "we do not find evidence for non - gaussian variability .",
    "however this method assumes that the sample mean and standard deviation used are accurate representations of the true mean and standard deviation , and this might not be true in our case , due to the limited number of observation intervals .",
    "the same conclusions were reached by leighly ( 1999a ) from asca data , using a different method based on the skewness of the flux distribution .",
    "we have presented rosat hri observations of the radio - loud nls1 galaxy pks  0558504 .",
    "the main results can be summarized as follows :    from the spatial analysis , no other strong x - ray sources have been detected in the neighborhood of pks  0558504 , therefore external contributions to the high luminosity and to the strong variability from a nearby source are ruled out . by comparing the x - ray observations throughout the last decade , it is evident that the strong x - ray variability of pks  0558504 occurs persistently . during the rosat hri observations ,",
    "pks  0558504 shows strong variability , both on medium ( months ) and short ( days , hours ) time scales .",
    "the most extreme variation implies a radiative efficiency larger than the theoretical maximum for accretion onto a schwarzschild black hole , and our findings generally support those of remillard et al .",
    "( 1991 ) where a relativistic @xmath79 flare was discovered . as pks",
    "0558504 is a radio - loud object , beamed emission from a jet could be the cause for the brightness and variability in x - rays .",
    "however , it is worth noting that the radio - quiet nls1 phl  1092 has also shown a relativistic flare @xmath80 , and radio - quiet nls1 more generally show enhanced x - ray variability .",
    "the soft x - ray spectrum is rather steep with a power law photon index of @xmath81 and shows no strong indications for spectral breaks .",
