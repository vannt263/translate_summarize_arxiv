    "comparative genomics is nowadays a classical field in computational biology , and one of its typical problems is to cluster sets of orthologous genes that have virtually the same function in several genomes .",
    "a very strong paradigm is that groups of genes which remain `` close '' during evolution work together ( see for instance @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , a widely used approach to obtain interesting clusters is to try to cluster genes or other biological units ( for instance unique contigs of protein domains ) according to their common proximity on several genomes . for this goal ,",
    "many different cluster models have been proposed , like common intervals in @xcite , conserved intervals in @xcite , @xmath8-patterns in @xcite , gene teams in @xcite , domain teams in @xcite , approximate common intervals in @xcite and so on , considering different chromosome models ( permutations , signed permutations , sequences , graphs , etc . ) or different distance models ( accepting gaps , distance modeled as weighted graphs , etc . )    among all those models , the first proposed , and still one of the most used in practice , is the concept of _ common interval _ on genomes represented by permutations .",
    "a set of genes form a common interval of @xmath0 genomes if it appears as a segment on each of the @xmath0 unsigned permutations that represent the genomes .",
    "the orders inside the segments might be totally different .",
    "the model of conserved interval is close to the model of common interval but considers signed permutations .",
    "recently , nested common intervals ( easily extensible to nested conserved intervals ) were introduced in @xcite based on real data observation by @xcite .",
    "a common interval @xmath2 of size @xmath3 is nested if @xmath9 or if it contains at least one nested common interval of size @xmath10 .",
    "@xcite pointed that the nestedness assumption can strengthen the significance of detected clusters since it reduces the probability of observing them randomly .",
    "an @xmath11 time algorithm to compute all nested common intervals between two permutations has been presented in @xcite while between @xmath0 permutations a recent @xmath6 algorithm is proposed in @xcite , where _ nocc _ is the number of solutions .    in this paper , we exhibit two simple algorithms to easily compute nested common and conserved intervals of @xmath0 permutations from their natural tree representations . also , with the same simplicity , we propose to deal with a generalization of nested common intervals , called @xmath1-nested common intervals , and with its variant for conserved intervals ( which are a signed version of common intervals ) , called @xmath1-nested conserved intervals .",
    "these new classes allow - as @xmath1 grows - for a less constraint containment between the intervals in the family .",
    "indeed , a nested interval @xmath2 must contain a nested interval of size @xmath10 or be a unit interval .",
    "a @xmath1-nested common ( resp .",
    "conserved ) interval must contain a @xmath1-nested common ( resp . conserved ) interval of size at least @xmath4 or be a unit interval .",
    "nested intervals are indead @xmath12-nested . from a biological point of view , this is equivalent to modeling clusters with a larger variability in gene content and gene order , thus allowing algorithms to deal with annotation errors .",
    "however , the study and validation of this new interval model is deferred to further applied studies . in this paper",
    "we focus on the algorithmic aspects .    given a set @xmath13 of @xmath0 permutations on @xmath14 elements representing genomes with no duplicates , our simple algorithms for finding all @xmath1-nested common or conserved intervals of @xmath13 run in @xmath15-time and need @xmath16 additional space , where _ nocc _ is the number of solutions . in this way",
    ", our algorithm for common intervals performs as well as the algorithm in @xcite for the case of @xmath0 permutations , and proposes an efficient approach for the new classes of @xmath1-nested intervals .",
    "moreover , a slight modification of our approach allows us to count the number of @xmath1-nested common or conserved intervals of @xmath0 permutations in @xmath7 time .",
    "efficiently counting the number of @xmath1-nested common intervals without enumerating them is very usefull when one needs to compute similarity functions between genomes that are expressed in terms of number of intervals .",
    "see for instance @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [",
    "sect : generalities ] we present the main definitions for common and conserved intervals , and precisely state the problem to solve . in section [ sect : pq ] we focus on @xmath1-nested common intervals , recalling the data structure called a @xmath17-tree , giving a characterization of @xmath1-nested common intervals and showing how @xmath17-trees can be used to find all @xmath1-nested common intervals . in section [",

    "affirmation 1 in theorem [ th : arbret ] ensures that each interval is output exactly once .",

    "all these operations obvisously take @xmath16 time and space .",

    "we also show that our approach can be applied to conserved intervals , whose structure and properties are close but still different from those of common intervals .",
