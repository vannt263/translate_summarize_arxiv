    "lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) is predicted to occur at an unobservably small rate in the standard model ( sm ) . in low energy supersymmetric theories , new sources of lepton flavor violation",
    "are generic in the soft breaking sector .",
    "the experimental non - observation of @xmath4 processes is particularly restrictive , given the impressive bounds on @xmath5 from mega @xcite and meg @xcite ; on @xmath4 conversion from sindrum  ii @xcite , and to a lesser extent from @xmath6 from sindrum @xcite .",
    "further progress is expected from various ongoing experiments as well as planned future experiments such as mu2e @xcite and other proposals utilizing project x at fermilab @xcite .",
    "the slepton mixing parameters are tightly constrained in the mssm @xcite by the above experiments .",
    "for instance , the most severe constraint arises from @xmath3 that involves a left - right slepton mixing . if one parametrizes the mixing as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the @xmath9element of the slepton mass squared matrix",
    ". then the non - observation of any @xmath3 events gives a bound of @xmath10 @xcite . in models where left - right sfermion mixings are absent ,",
    "the constraints on sfermion mixing can be significantly relaxed .",
    "one can accomplish this by enlarging the @xmath11-parity in the mssm to a @xmath12 continuous symmetry @xcite .",
    "@xmath11-symmetric supersymmetry has inspired recent model building @xcite .",
    "the mrssm features dirac gauginos and their phenomenology has been extensively studied @xcite .",
    "we follow a recent framework ( dubbed the mrssm ) proposed by @xcite .",
    "we investigate the processes @xmath3 , @xmath0 conversion , and @xmath2 .",
    "a scan over all sensitive parameters with respect to @xmath0 mixing was performed @xcite and it was shown that slepton mixing parameters in the mrssm could be as large as @xmath13 with bounds from current experiments .",
    "furthermore , the most severe constraint is obtained by combining @xmath3 and @xmath0 conversion on @xmath14 mixing .    the sensitivities to @xmath0",
    "conversion and @xmath2 at project x will be improved by factors @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively , over the sensitivities of current experiments @xcite .",
    "the exclusion plots assuming the above expected sensitivities plots will be presented in this paper .",
    "it will be organized as follow .",
    "section [ sec : flav ] gives a discussion on the flavor mixing in the mrssm .",
    "the results will be presented in section [ sec : res ] .",
    "finally , we will discuss the results in [ sec : diss ] .",
    "consider @xmath17 mixing in the mrssm , the mass eigenstates of the two sleptons , @xmath18 can be written as    @xmath19    to understand the dependence of @xmath0 amplitudes on the mixing parameters , consider the @xmath20 vertex , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the neutralino .",
    "dropping the subscripts @xmath23 and upon writing the slepton in the eigenbasis according to [ sleptonmixing ] , one sees that the interaction is proportional to either @xmath24 or @xmath25 .",
    "now consider diagrams corresponding to @xmath3 and @xmath0 conversion where only one slepton runs in the loop .",
    "because in all these diagrams the internal slepton line connects with both the external @xmath26 and @xmath27 line , the amplitude of all diagrams must be proportional to @xmath28 for each slepton `` chirality '' . for @xmath2 ,",
    "the diagrams contain terms that are proportional to @xmath29 and others that are proportional to @xmath30 due to the two sleptons running in the loop .",
    "because of the large intensity at project x , the mixing angle @xmath31 can be assumed to be small and the diagrams proportional to @xmath30 drop out . in other words , for a set given masses , the branching fraction of @xmath3 , @xmath0 conversion and @xmath2 are all proportional to @xmath32 .",
    "this fact is useful when one tries to estimate the bound on slepton mixing parameters during early runs of project x.    focusing on the first two generations of lepton mixing , the parameters sensitive to @xmath0 processes are the mixing parameters @xmath33 , the bino mass , @xmath34 , slepton masses , @xmath35 , down type higgsino mass @xmath36 , and the slepton mixing angles @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "the exclusion plots of @xmath0 conversion and @xmath2 with the expected limit at project x are shown in figures [ fig : conv ] and [ fig : eee ] .",
    "the following assumptions have been made to simplify the parameter space .",
    "first , the slepton hierarchy is set to have order one splitting .",
    "in particular , @xmath38 , so that the @xmath0 amplitudes are not overly suppressed by the super - jim mechanism .",
    "second , we only allow either the left handed or right handed mixing to be nonzero , but not both . this",
    "is done so that the contribution from each of the left - right sector is manifest . finally , we have set the down - type higgsino mass @xmath39 gev and the squark masses @xmath40 tev , where the squark masses appear only in the box diagram of @xmath0 conversion .",
    "we also note that the wino mass must be at least @xmath41 tev ) to be consistent with electroweak precision data @xcite .    the sensitivities to @xmath0 conversion and @xmath2 are expected to improve by @xmath15 and @xmath42 to @xmath43 respectively . in the scenario where no events from @xmath0 processes are observed , then one would expect the bound on the mixing parameters to be more restricted by @xmath44 for @xmath0 conversion and @xmath45 for @xmath2 .",
    "this can be seen in figures [ fig : conv ] and [ fig : eee ] .",
    "the results show that project x will be able to constrain the parameter space of @xmath0 mixing in the mrssm by @xmath0 conversion alone , giving bounds on the mixing parameters of @xmath46 for moderate slepton and bino masses . in the scenario where no @xmath0 events are observed ,",
    "the non - observation would motivate additional model building to explain the hierarchy between flavor conserving and flavor violating elements of the slepton mass matrix .",
    "the results presented here illustrate @xmath47 .",
    "for example , the contours in figure [ fig : eee ] are almost identical to the corresponding contours in @xcite , except that the values of @xmath37 are scaled down by @xmath45 .",
    "also , @xmath2 provides minimal improvement on the bound on left - handed @xmath0 mixing - it merely excludes the bottom left tail of the incoherence region for @xmath0 conversion . finally , we checked the bound from @xmath3 is weaker than the bound obtained in the other two processes in the region of parameter space of interest .",
    "note that all the masses used in this paper are expected to pass the collider bounds from the lhc .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the lhc bound on squark masses of the first and second generations in a model with @xmath11-symmetry is @xmath48 gev .",
    "analysis for the bounds on slepton and neutralino masses have not been performed . however , using the squark pair production channels in @xcite and translating it to slepton pair production , it is safe to expect that the lhc does not give stringent bounds on the slepton masses .",
    "the reason is that drell - yan is the only production process of the pair production of sleptons at the lhc . whereas gluon fusion channels contribute to the squark pair production channel",
    "also , the amplitude of slepton pair production is down by a color factor of 3 and the ratio of electroweak to strong couplings @xmath49 when compared to squark pair production .",
    "rf would like to thank the organizers for the invitation to the project x workshop in 2012 .",
