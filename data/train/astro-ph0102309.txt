    "the 5.3-ms pulsar j1012 + 5307 was discovered during a survey for short period pulsars with the 76-m lovell radio telescope at jodrell bank .",
    "nicastro et al",
    ".   showed that the pulsar is in a binary system with an orbital period of 14.5 hr and a companion mass between 0.11m@xmath2 and 0.25m@xmath2 ( 90% confidence level , c.l . ) .",
    "optical observations reported by lorimer et al",
    ".   revealed an optical counterpart within 02@xmath305 of the pulsar timing position , consistent with its being a white dwarf ( wd ) companion of mass 0.15m@xmath2 .",
    "indeed , psr  j1012 + 5307 is one of the few examples of binary millisecond pulsars where optical observations of the wd companion considerably enhance our knowledge about the radio pulsar and its binary system @xcite .",
    "callanan et al .",
    ", for instance , used their results from optical observations to obtain a number of essential pieces of information for this system . comparing the measured optical luminosity to its value expected from wd models , they determined the distance to be @xmath490 pc .",
    "the doppler shift of the measured h - spectrum of the wd companion gives an additional radial velocity component of 44@xmath38 kms@xmath5 relative to the solar system barycentre , ssb . from the radial velocity ( semi-)amplitude and the orbital parameters known from pulsar timing",
    ", the mass ratio between the pulsar and its companion is measured to be @xmath610.5@xmath30.5 .    in order to derive the intrinsic spin - down age of millisecond pulsars , one needs to have accurate distance estimates to correct for apparent acceleration effects @xcite .",
    "a proper motion obtained by pulsar timing is usually converted into a transverse velocity by using a distance estimate derived from the dispersion in the interstellar medium , applying a model of the free electron density distribution @xcite . however",
    ", this model yields a high level of systematic uncertainty ( e.g.  toscano et al .",
    "the dispersion measure ( dm ) distance of 520 pc is indeed somewhat smaller than the distance derived from luminosity models .",
    "applying classical cooling models @xcite for low mass wds and the dm distance , lorimer et al .",
    "derived an age of only 0.3  gyr for the wd companion which was in apparent contradiction with the inferred spin - down age of the pulsar of 7  gyr .",
    "however , alberts et al .   were able to model the binary parameters if they assumed that the cooling age of the wd is similar to the spin - down age of the pulsar .",
    "more recently , driebe et al .   modeled the cooling process of wds , obtaining an age of 6@xmath71  gyr for the companion of psr  j1012 + 5307 .",
    "ergma et al .   modeled evolutionary sequences of neutron stars with close low mass binary companions and short orbital periods , whilst sarna et al .   developed an evolutionary scenario for psr  j1012 + 5307 , reproducing the observed binary period and companion mass .",
    "they modeled the age of the neutron star to be between 4.5 and 6.0gyr , whilst the mass of the wd was found to be @xmath8 m@xmath9 , consistent with mass estimates derived by other models based on different observations and evolutionary models @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we combine a set of high precision timing data with the information derived for the binary system from radio pulsar and optical wd observations as well as from model calculations . after a short description of the timing observations and data reduction techniques ,",
    "we describe a new binary timing model that is important for the low eccentricity case , discuss the resulting solution using statistical tests , and present the derived timing parameters .",
    "these results are analysed in the following sections .",
    "we show that proper motion and galactic acceleration of psr  j1012 + 5307 have a significant influence on the derived characteristic age .",
    "furthermore , we obtain strong limits on the true eccentricity of the system and discuss its meaning for evolutionary scenarios . as a result of the stringent limits obtained both on the change in orbital period as well as on the true eccentricity of the system",
    ", we demonstrate that this binary system is highly suitable for testing different theories of gravitation .",
    "we have made regular high precision timing observations of psr  j1012 + 5307 since october 1996 using the 100-m radio telescope of the max planck institut fr radioastronomie in effelsberg near bonn .",
    "the typical observing rate has been once per month with a usual observing time of about one hour .",
    "the overall post - fit rms of the timing model applied to the 1213 resulting times - of - arrival ( toas ) is 3.1 @xmath10s .",
    "sometimes , however , the source shows strong intensity fluctuations on time scales of typically two hours caused by scintillation effects in the ionised component of the interstellar medium .",
    "we made use of these intensity maxima by optimising our observing strategy , i.e. , staying `` on source '' until the pulsar becomes weaker again .",
    "as a consequence of this highly successful `` scintillation hopping '' , many toas are of much higher quality , with errors frequently smaller than 1 @xmath11s .",
    "figure  [ 1012sci ] shows a typical example for the development of toa uncertainties during a scintillation maximum .",
    "since we have many such high quality toas covering several orbits , they proved to be extremely useful for the precise determination of orbital parameters .",
    "most of the data were obtained with a 1.31.7  ghz tunable hemt receiver installed in the primary focus of the telescope .",
    "the noise temperature of this system is 25  k , resulting in a system temperature from 30  to 50  k on cold sky depending on elevation .",
    "the antenna gain at these frequencies is 1.5  k  jy@xmath5 .",
    "an intermediate frequency ( if ) centred on 150 mhz for left - hand ( lhc ) and right - hand ( rhc ) circularly polarised signals was obtained after down - conversion from a central rf frequency of usually 1410 mhz .    in order to monitor dm changes ,",
    "occasionally we also obtained data at 860 and 2700 mhz . for the 860-mhz observations we used an uncooled hemt - receiver operating in the primary focus with a bandwidth of 30  mhz .",
    "the system temperature during the observations was about 65  k on cold sky with a telescope gain of about 1.5  k  jy@xmath5 .",
    "the 2700-mhz data were obtained with a cooled hemt receiver in the secondary focus , with a system temperature of typically 50  k on cold sky . as for the other receivers , lhc and rhc signals",
    "were mixed down to an if of 150  mhz .",
    "the signals received from the telescope were acquired and processed with the effelsberg - berkeley pulsar processor ( ebpp ) which removes the dispersive effects of the interstellar medium on - line using the technique of `` coherent de - dispersion '' @xcite . before entering the ebpp , the two if lhc and rhc signals are converted to an internal if of 440 mhz .",
    "a maximum bandpass of 112  mhz is split into four independent portions for both circular polarisations .",
    "each portion is mixed down to baseband and subdivided into 8 narrow channels via a set of digital filters @xcite for coherent online de - dispersion by convolution using a custom vlsi device . in total 64 output signals are detected and integrated in phase with the predicted topocentric pulse period .",
    "a toa was calculated for each average profile obtained during a 510 min observation . during this process",
    ", the observed time - stamped profile was compared to a synthetic template , which was constructed out of 12 gaussian components fitted to a high signal - to - noise standard profile ( see kramer et al .  1998 ; 1999).this template matching was done by a least - squares fitting of the fourier - transformed data @xcite .",
    "the final toa was obtained by using the measured time delay between the actual profile and the template , and the accurate time stamp of the data provided by a local h - maser and corrected off - line to utc(nist ) using recorded information from the satellites of the global positioning system ( gps ) .",
    "the uncertainty of each toa was estimated using a method described by downs & reichley .      since its discovery in 1993",
    ", psr  j1012 + 5307 has been regularly monitored using the 76-m lovell telescope at jodrell bank with cryogenic receivers at 408 , 606 , and 1404mhz .",
    "both lhc and rhc signals were observed using a @xmath12-mhz filter bank at 408 and 606mhz and a @xmath13-mhz filter bank at 1404mhz .",
    "after detection , the signals from the two polarisations were filtered , digitised at appropriate sampling intervals , and incoherently de - dispersed in hardware before being folded on - line with the topocentric pulse period and written to disk .",
    "each integration was typically of 13 minutes duration ; 6 or 12 such integrations usually constituted an observation . in the analysis stage , the profiles were added in polarisation pairs before being summed to produce a single total - intensity profile .",
    "a standard pulse template was fitted to the observed profiles at each frequency to determine a total of 400 pulse toas .",
    "details of the observing system and the data reduction scheme can be found elsewhere ( e.g.  bell et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "although the templates used in the effelsberg and jodrell bank data reduction differed , resulting offsets were absorbed in a global least - squares fit .",
    "the typical measurement accuracy of the jodrell bank 1404 mhz timing data is about 9 @xmath11s .",
    "the combined toas , corrected to utc(nist ) and weighted by their individual uncertainties determined in the fitting process , were analysed with the tempo software package , using the de200 ephemeris of the jet propulsion laboratory @xcite .",
    "owing to the extremely low eccentricity of this system , we applied a binary timing model that uses the laplace lagrange parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 and the time of ascending node @xmath16 in place of the keplerian parameters @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( see appendix  a for details ) .",
    "the keplerian parameters as a function of those used by the model can be calculated as @xmath20    tempo minimizes the sum of weighted squared timing residuals , i.e. , the difference between observed and model toas , @xmath21 , yielding a set of improved pulsar parameters and post - fit timing residuals .",
    "the timing residuals shown in fig .  [ reff ] indicate deviations from the timing model which are slightly larger than the calculated toa uncertainties , @xmath22 .",
    "this most likely stems from a small underestimation of the error in the toas .",
    "the data uncertainties used in the following were scaled by an appropriate factor to achieve a uniform reduced @xmath23 for each data set . in order to test the statistical properties of our data we have generated histograms of the deviations of the timing residuals from the model .",
    "the final residuals show the expected gaussian distribution ( fig .",
    "[ geff ] ) .    in order to search for systematic errors that are either small enough to be individually undetectable or",
    "have a time dependence which approximates some linear combination of terms in the model , we have searched for tell - tale correlations among nearly adjacent post - fit residuals ( cf .",
    "taylor & weisberg 1989 ) .",
    "we combined 2 , 4 , 8 etc .",
    "consecutive toas and evaluated the average residual of the remaining data set .",
    "a `` clean '' data set should exhibit a slope of @xmath24 in a plot of rms versus number of combined toas .",
    "the results , as shown in fig .",
    "[ rmspl ] , show no or very little correlation among effelsberg data and the jodrell bank data recorded at 410 mhz after employing the timing model described in table  [ params ] . the jodrell bank data at 1400 mhz and 606  mhz exhibit , however , some correlation .",
    "we tested for possible impact of these correlations on the fit parameters by analysing the timing data without one or both of these data sub - sets .",
    "the parameters derived from these reduced data sets did not significantly differ from those derived by the fit to all the data .",
    "the final parameters obtained from fitting the timing model to our data of psr  j1012 + 5307 are shown in table  [ params ] .",
    "the upper limits on the derivatives of @xmath17 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 were obtained by separately fitting for each of them .",
    "these were set to zero during the fits for all other parameters .",
    "the residuals show slow variations that can be removed by fitting for @xmath27 .",
    "we do not believe that instrumental effects can account for this effect but rather suggest that the measurement reflects rotational instabilities in the pulsar . in this case ,",

    "as summarised in section [ intro ] the binary millisecond pulsar psr  j1012 + 5307 is unique since the combination of optical and radio measurements allows a full determination of the motion of the system through space and also the determination of several intrinsic parameters .",
    "the full 3-d motion of the pulsar relative to the ssb is determined by combining the timing proper motion with distance to the system obtained from luminosity models for the white dwarf companion , @xmath74 pc .",
    "this distance is consistent with the obtained upper limit for the timing parallax . given the pulsar s ecliptic latitude of 38@xmath75 , it is not unexpected that a significant value for the timing parallax could not be obtained .",
    "we derive transverse velocities of @xmath76 optical measurements ( cf .",
    "section  [ intro ] ) yield a radial velocity component of + 44(8 ) kms@xmath5 .",
    "hence , the total velocity of the system is 111(28 ) kms@xmath5 .",
    "this value is consistent with the average space velocity of millisecond pulsars of 130 km s@xmath5 estimated by lyne et al .   and toscano et al .",
    "due to the motion of psr  j1012 + 5307 relative to the solar system , any period @xmath77 of the pulsar spin or binary system , measured at the ssb , differs from the period @xmath78 in the pulsar reference frame by a doppler factor @xmath79 .",
    "following damour & taylor , we write the relation between these periods @xmath80 with @xmath81 the unit vector to the pulsar and @xmath82 the relative velocity between the pulsar and the ssb @xcite . as",
    "@xmath83 is typically less than 0.1% for millisecond pulsars , this doppler shift is for most purposes unimportant .",

    "the small correction term @xmath92s@xmath5 for the galactic acceleration is obtained applying a model for the galactic potential @xcite . inserting these parameters into eqns .",
    "[ shkint ] and [ galint ] , we obtain a doppler correction of @xmath93 its error is dominated by the uncertainty in the distance to the pulsar .",
    "we can now use our timing results to obtain the true spin - down age , the so - called characteristic age of psr  j1012 + 5307 . with a spin period of @xmath94ms and a doppler factor as given in eqn .",
    "[ dotpd1012 ] , we derive a doppler correction of @xmath95 which has to be subtracted from the measured @xmath96 before calculating the intrinsic characteristic age of the system : @xmath97 we note that the characteristic age assumes magnetic dipole braking ( i.e. , braking index of 3 ) and is only a realistic estimate of the real pulsar age if the initial spin period was sufficiently small ( camilo et al .",
    "although this may not apply to he - wd binaries ( backer 1998 ) , the characteristic age is in reasonable agreement with a cooling age of the white dwarf as derived by evolutionary models @xcite .      in appendix",
    "a we analyse the contribution of the shapiro delay for binary orbits with moderate inclination angles and negligible intrinsic eccentricities to the apparent eccentricity of the system .",
    "as we show , the shapiro delay can not be separated from the roemer delay , which leads to a small correction to the observed eccentricity . in order to investigate this effect for psr  j1012 + 5307 quantitatively and to obtain the true orbital eccentricity ,",
    "we make use of independent determinations of the system parameters .",
    "unlike general relativity , many alternative theories of gravity predict the presence of a radiative monopole and dipole as well as the quadrupole and higher order multipoles @xcite .",
    "scalar - tensor theories , for instance , predict for binary systems a loss of orbital energy which is at highest order dominated by scalar dipole radiation . as a result ,",
    "the period @xmath26 of a circular orbit will change with @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the bare gravitational constant , @xmath111 is the speed of light and @xmath112 and @xmath108 the mass of the pulsar and its companion @xcite . the parameters @xmath113 and @xmath114 represent the effective coupling strengths of the scalar field to the pulsar and its companion , respectively .",
    "damour & esposito - farse show that @xmath114 can be neglected compared to @xmath113 , since the gravitational binding energy per unit mass of a wd , @xmath115 , is very much smaller than that of a 1.4-m@xmath9 neutron star , @xmath116 .    using this assumption , and taking @xmath117 , eqn .",

    "the observable rate of change of the orbital period of psr  j1012 + 5307 is the sum of several contributions , either intrinsic to the orbit or caused by projection effects : @xmath120",

    "simulations of future observations show that the precision of the measurement of @xmath70 will increase significantly .",
    "a continuation of our timing observations with an accuracy and observing rate similar to that of the past few years will lead to an improvement by a factor of about 3 within the next three years .",
    "the applicability of this improvement for the value of @xmath139 might be reduced by the unknown contribution of @xmath140 , unless the limits on this parameter are also improved .",
    "it is also desirable that the distance to psr  j1012 + 5307 be determined with higher accuracy to allow a more reliable estimate of the transverse doppler effect .",
    "will & nordtvedt ( 1972 ) pointed out that one expects the existence of a preferred cosmic rest frame for gravitational interaction if gravity is mediated in part by a long range vector field or by a second tensor field . in the post - newtonian limit",
    "all the gravitational effects associated with such a preferred frame are phenomenologically describable by two parameters , @xmath141 and @xmath142 . only in gravity theories without a preferred frame , e.g.  general relativity , are the values of these parameters equal to zero",
    ".    a consequence of a preferred cosmic rest frame would be the introduction of an eccentricity into orbits of gravitationally bound bodies of different masses which are in motion relative to this preferred frame .",
    "this effect is quantified by the parameter @xmath141 .",
    "wex has applied a statistical analysis of all pulsar binary systems to find limits for this parameter .",
    "this analysis yields @xmath143 at 95% c.l .",
    "due to its extremely low true eccentricity and the known three dimensional proper motion , the data presented here for psr  j1012 + 5307 and included in wex s analysis play a central role in this analysis .",
    "they might provide more stringent tests of local lorentz invariance , if the real eccentricity of the system is even smaller and better observational limits on it are found .",
    "over the observed time span of about 7 years , psr  j1012 + 5307 shows a significant deviation from a simple @xmath38@xmath40 spin down behaviour . in order to model this effect ,",
    "the spin - down model can be extended by allowing for a non - zero second derivative of the spin frequency , @xmath28 ( e.g.  cordes & downes 1985 ) .",
    "however , rather than being the result of rotational irregularities of the neutron star itself , a possible alternative explanation for a second spin frequency derivative could be a third order term of the proper motion , @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the radial velocity of the system @xcite .",

    "1993 ) .    as a possible explanation , a second period derivative in the timing residuals",
    "can also be the result of a second light companion in a wider orbit @xcite . assuming a circular orbit and an intermediate orbital phase , the measured value for @xmath28 can be explained with e.g.  a planet of terrestrial mass at @xmath150  au distance or a jupiter - like planet at @xmath151  au distance from the centre of mass .",
    "future observations will show if the timing residuals can be explained by a second keplerian orbit .    however , it is more likely that the irregularities are intrinsic to the pulsar itself .",
    "timing noise has been studied for normal , slowly rotating pulsars .",
    "arzoumanian et al . ,",
    "for instance , defined the stability parameter @xmath152 where @xmath153 is the observing span which in their case was @xmath154 s. despite noticeable scatter , they obtained a correlation of this parameter with the period derivative for slowly rotating pulsars .",
    "this correlation predicts a value of @xmath155 for psr  j1012 + 5307 . using timing data over a time span @xmath154 s , we measure a value of @xmath156 .",
    "given that the fit leading to arzoumanian et al.s relation was made by eye , both values are in excellent agreement , in particular given the large scatter seen for normal pulsars .",
    "moreover , the value of the second spin frequency derivative , @xmath157s@xmath44 , is similar to the value of @xmath28 published for psr  b1937 + 21 @xcite .",
    "both sources exhibit a @xmath158 consistent with the correlation derived by arzoumanian et al .",
    "although we can not yet completely rule out a different origin of the measured period second derivative , the value determined is apparently consistent with what is known for timing noise from normal pulsars .",
    "assuming that we are now indeed observing rotational irregularities in two galactic field millisecond pulsars , being consistent with the behaviour of normal pulsars extrapolated to very small period derivatives , it may indicate that the empirical relation found by arzoumanian et al .",
    "is generally valid for millisecond pulsars as well as for normal pulsars .",
    "as other millisecond pulsars are now being monitored with similar timing precision over similar time spans , this conjecture can be tested",

    "the measurements and upper limits for the orbital eccentricities of systems with appropriate evolutionary history are plotted in fig.[eccplt ] .",

    "therefore , it is interesting to note that the upper limit for the eccentricity of the 0.6-d binary pulsar j1012 + 5307 of only @xmath162 ( 68% c.l . ) is significantly lower than that of psr  j0613@xmath290200 .      the motion of the binary system relative to the ssb results in a change of the orbital inclination that causes a variation in the projected semi - major axis of the system @xcite . the amplitude of this effect is given by @xmath163 where @xmath164 is the position angle of the ascending node and @xmath34 and @xmath36 the components of the proper motion in mas@xmath165yr@xmath5 . given the value of the orbital inclination @xmath166 as determined from the white dwarf optical light curve , a measurement of @xmath68 allows one to restrict the orbital orientation @xmath164 . using our current data set ,",
    "we derive a 1-@xmath135 uncertainty for @xmath68 that is about twice the value expected for a perfect alignment between @xmath164 and @xmath10 .",
    "continuing timing observation will permit the measurement of this effect .",
    "simulations , assuming an accuracy and data - taking rate similar to those at present , show that a 3-@xmath149 detection of @xmath68 should be possible within the next four or five years .",
    "this would finally complete our knowledge of the full orientation and motion of the psr  j1012 + 5307 system .",
    "we have performed long - term high - precision timing observations of psr  j1012 + 5307 .",
    "combining our measurements with results based on optical observations , we derived complete 3-d velocity information for this system , permitting the correction of the measured spin parameters for doppler effects . due to the precision of our measurements and the extremely small eccentricity of this binary pulsar ,",
    "we could use it as an ideal laboratory to test certain aspects of theories of gravitation .",
    "the deviation of the timing data from a simple spin - down model is probably due to rotational instabilities which are consistent with the extrapolation of the known spin - down behaviour of slowly rotating pulsars , suggesting that this phenomenon is a common property of most pulsars .",
