    "according to press - schechter model , the fraction of mass in the universe contained in gravitationally bounded object more massive than @xmath0 is @xcite @xmath1 here , @xmath2 is the number density of objects of mass in @xmath3 , and the integral on the left - hand side gives the total mass density in overdense regions more massive than @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath4 is the probability that a randomly chosen point in the universe has density contrast @xmath5 at time @xmath6 , and @xmath0 is the smoothing scale of @xmath7 ( @xmath8 is the radius of the spherical overdense region ) .",
    "the value @xmath9 is some critical value of the density contrast which corresponds to the beginning of the non - linear regime . in a case of a gaussian field of density fluctuations",
    "this probability is @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the variance of the smoothed density .",
    "the mass distribution of gravitationally bounded objects is @xcite @xmath12 the variance @xmath13 is given by the relation @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the smoothing window function , @xmath16 is the horizon crossing amplitude , @xmath17 is the transfer function .    for the calculation of the mass spectrum of pbhs one must use the connection between the pbh mass @xmath18 and characteristics of the overdense region",
    ". in the model of the near - critical collapse proposed in ref.@xcite one",
    "has the relation : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the horizon mass at time @xmath6 when the density fluctuations develop , and @xmath21 is the smoothed density contrast at the moment when the fluctuation crosses horizon , @xmath22    in the approach of ref.@xcite all pbhs have masses roughly equal to the horizon mass at a moment of the formation , independently of the perturbation size .",
    "the approximate connection between the pbh mass and the horizon mass in such a model is very simple : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the ratio of the pressure to energy density ( @xmath25 in the radiation dominated era ) .    using these formulas",
    "one obtains the final expression for the pbh mass spectrum @xcite    @xmath26   \\cdot\\frac{\\partial k_{fl}}{\\partial m }          \\right\\}\\right .",
    "\\left.\\left(\\frac{(\\delta_h^r)^2}{\\sigma_h^2 ( m_h)}-1\\right)\\right| e^{-\\frac{(\\delta_h^r)^2}{2 \\sigma_h^2 ( m_h ) } } \\frac{d\\delta_h^r}{d f(m,\\delta_h^r)/dm}\\;. \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here we use the general notation for the connection between @xmath18 , @xmath0 and @xmath21 , @xmath27 particular cases of this connection are given by eqs.([__5],[__7 ] ) .    substituting the expression for the window function , @xmath28 and for the transfer function @xcite , @xmath29 and the parametrization @xmath30 for the horizon crossing amplitude into eq.([__4 ] ) for the variance @xmath13 one obtains , approximately , @xmath31 the exact value of the coefficient @xmath32 depends on the spectral index ( for @xmath33 @xmath34 ) . in eq.([__13 ] )",
    "@xmath35 is the comoving wave number , characterizing the perturbed region , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is the fluctuation mass at the moment when the perturbed region enters the horizon at the radiation dominated era .",
    "the value of @xmath37 is simply connected with @xmath35 : @xmath38 at the same time , an initial value of the fluctuation mass , @xmath0 , is proportional to @xmath39 , so @xmath40 .",
    "the exact connection is @xmath41 the denominator @xmath42 in eq.([__13 ] ) must be taken at @xmath43 , and one can easily see that @xmath44 at last , in the spectrum formula ( [ 1_20 ] ) the following notation is used @xmath45 the limits of integration in eq.([1_20 ] ) are determined using the conditions @xmath46    we have , for calculations of @xmath47 two free parameters : the spectral index @xmath48 , giving the perturbation amplitude through the normalization on cobe data on large scales , and @xmath6 , the moment of time just after reheating , from which the process of pbh formation started .",
    "the value of @xmath6 is connected , in our approach , with a value of the reheating temperature , @xmath49 ( @xmath50 is a number of degrees of freedom in the early universe ) .",
    "the initial horizon mass @xmath20 is expressed through  @xmath6 : @xmath51    in the case of page - hawking @xcite collapse the minimum mass in the pbh mass spectrum is given by the simple formula @xmath52 which follows from eq.([__7 ] ) .",
    "correspondingly , the minimum value of pbh mass is determined entirely by the reheating temperature . in the case of the near - critical collapse",
    "there is no minimum value of the pbh mass in the spectrum because @xmath53 can be almost equal to @xmath9 ( see eq.([__5 ] ) ) . in this case",
    "the pbh mass spectrum has a broad maximum at @xmath54 .",
    "evolution of a pbh mass spectrum due to the evaporation leads to the approximate expression for this spectrum at any moment of time : @xmath55 where @xmath56 accounts for the degrees of freedom of evaporated particles and , strictly speaking , is a function of a running value of the pbh mass @xmath57 . in all our numerical calculations we use the approximation @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the value of @xmath18 in the initial mass spectrum corresponding to a maximum of this spectrum or , in the case of page - hawking collapse , to a minimum value of pbh mass in the spectrum .",
    "special study shows that errors connected with such an approximation are rather small .",
    "the detailed calculations of the function @xmath60 were carried out in the works @xcite .",
    "here we use the simplified approach in which @xmath60 is represented by a series of step functions @xcite    the expression for a spectrum of the background radiation is @xcite @xmath61 \\cdot f(e\\cdot ( 1+z),m)e^{-\\tau(e , z)}\\nonumber\\\\ \\\\ \\equiv \\int f(e , z)d \\log_{10 } ( z+1).\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in this formula @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 are cosmic scale factors at @xmath6 , @xmath65 and at present time , respectively , and @xmath66 is a total instantaneous spectrum of the background radiation ( neutrinos or photons ) from the black hole evaporation .",
    "it includes the pure hawking term and contributions from fragmentations of evaporated quarks and from decays of pions and muons ( see @xcite and earlier papers @xcite for details ) .    in the last line of eq.([10 ] ) we changed the variable @xmath65 on @xmath67 using the flat model with @xmath68 for which @xmath69",
    "in some theoretical schemes ( e.g. , in the model of spin - flavor precession in a magnetic field ) the sun can emit a large flux of antineutrinos .",
    "the lsd experiment @xcite sets the upper limit on this flux , @xmath70  % .",
    "the corresponding constraints on diffuse neutrino background from primordial black holes were obtained in the work of authors @xcite .",
    "recently , the kamland experiment obtained a new limit on electron antineutrino flux from the sun , according to which this flux is less than @xmath71 of the ssm @xmath72  @xmath73 flux .",
    "the neutrino detection was carried out in both experiments using the reaction @xmath74 no candidates were found in @xcite for an expected background of @xmath75 events .",
    "we calculate the limit on the antineutrino flux using the formula @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the cross - section of the reaction ( [ 27.1 ] ) averaged over neutrino background spectrum from pbhs , @xmath78 is the neutrino energy range measured in the experiment ( @xmath79  mev ) , @xmath80  s is the livetime , and @xmath81 is the number of target protons in the fiducial volume .    using the results of calculations of electron neutrino background spectra from pbhs (",
    "the examples of such spectra are given on fig.1 for the case of page - hawking collapse ) and normalization of the perturbation amplitude @xmath82 on cobe data ( for details see @xcite ) , we obtain the constraints on the spectral index @xmath48 shown on fig.2 .",
