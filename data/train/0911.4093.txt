    "as far as we know , in this context , only the simplest situations have been considered , namely the tunnelling decay from an isolated minimum of  @xmath6 to a continuum and the tunnelling oscillations between @xmath7 degenerated minima of @xmath6 that are related by an @xmath7-fold symmetry . in those cases ,",
    "what can be captured is tunnelling at the lowest energy only . however , not to speak of the highly non - trivial cases of tunnelling in non - autonomous and/or non - separable multidimensional systems , there are many situations that can not be straightforwardly treated with a simple inversion of the 1d , time - independent , potential .    first , tunnelling ",

    "real _ classical solutions of the original ( non wick - rotated ) hamilton s equations  may manifest itself through a transition that is not necessarily a classically forbidden jump in _ position _  @xcite .",
    "for instance , the reflection above an energy barrier , as a forbidden jump in momentum , is indeed a tunnelling process  @xcite . in the following",
    ", we will consider the case of a simple pendulum whose dynamics is governed by the potential  @xmath8 ; for energies larger than the strength  @xmath9 of the potential , one can observe a quantum transition between states rotating in opposite direction while two distinct rotational classical solutions , obtained one from each other by the reflection symmetry , are always disconnected in real phase - space .    a second example is provided by a typical situation of resonant tunnelling : when , for instance , @xmath6 has a third , deeper , well which lies in between two symmetric wells ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:3puits]a ) , the oscillation frequency between the latter can be affected by several orders of magnitude , when two eigenenergies get nearly degenerate with a third one , corresponding to a state localised in the central well .",
    "then , we lose the customary exponential weakness of tunnelling and it is worth stressing , coming back for a second to quantum field theory , that having a nearly full tunnelling transmission through a double barrier may have drastic consequences in some cosmological models . in this example , one can immediately see ( fig .",
    "[ fig:3puits]b ) that @xmath10 also has an energy barrier and working with a complete wick rotation only remains insufficient in that case .    in order to describe the tunnelling transmission at an energy  @xmath11 below the top of an energy barrier , which may be crucial in some chemical reactions , the pioneer works by freed  @xcite , george and miller  @xcite ,",
    "have shown that the computation of a green s function  @xmath12 ( or a scattering matrix element ) requires taking into consideration classical trajectories with a complex time .",

    "though well - suited for the study of scattering , indirect computations are required to extract from the poles of the energy green s function   some spectral signatures of tunnelling in bounded systems . generically , these signatures appear as small splittings between two quasi - degenerate energy levels and can be seen as a narrow avoided crossing of the two levels when a classical parameter is varied  @xcite . in the present article ,",
    "we propose a unified treatment that provides a direct computation of these splittings ( formulae  [ eq : deltae0 ] or  [ eq : deltaen ] ) ; as shown in section  [ sec : starting points ] , it takes full advantage of the possibility of working not necessarily with purely imaginary time , but with a general parametrisation of complex time as first suggested in  @xcite .",
    "the semiclassical approach naturally follows ( sec .",
    "[ sec : semiclassical ] ) and some general asymptotic expansions can be written ( equations   and  ) and simplified ( equation ) ; they constitute the main results of this paper . to understand where these formulae come from and how they work",

    "[ sec : resonanttunnelling ] , where an appropriate incomplete wick rotation  @xmath14 provides the key to showing how interference effects  la fabry - prot between several complex trajectories reproduce the non - exponential behaviour of resonant tunnelling , already at work in open systems with a double barrier @xcite . after having shown how to adapt our method to the computations of escape rates from a stable island in phase - space ( sec .",
    "[ sec : escape_rate ] ) , we will conclude with more long  term considerations by explaining how our approach provides a natural and new starting point for studying tunnelling in multidimensional systems .",
    "a particularly simple signature of tunnelling can be identified when the hamiltonian has a two fold symmetry and , therefore , we will consider quantum systems whose time - independent hamiltonian  @xmath15 commute with an operator  @xmath16 such that  @xmath17 ( the  @xmath18 allows to distinguish the quantum operators from the classical phase - space functions or maps ) .",

    "this can be done by constructing a phase - space representation of  @xmath24 , typically the wigner or the husimi representation , and look where the corresponding phase - space function  @xmath25 is mainly localised ( all the more sharply than @xmath23 is small ) . for a hamiltonian of the form   where  @xmath6 has local minima , some of the eigenstates remain localised in the neighbourhood of the stable equilibrium points . for instance , for a double - well potential",

    "this is very general , even for multidimensional non - integrable systems : the splitting @xmath36 between some nearly degenerated doublets provides a quantitative manifestation of the tunnelling between the phase - space regions where the corresponding eigenstates are localised .    rather than computing the poles of  @xmath37 ,",
    "another systematic strategy to obtain one individual splitting is to start with herring s formula  @xcite that relies on the knowledge of the eigenfunctions outside the classically allowed regions in phase - space . here",
    ", we will propose alternative formulae @xcite that involve traces of a product of operators , among them the evolution operator , @xmath38 analytically continued in some sector of the complex time domain .",
    "this approach , which privileges the time - domain , provides , of course , a natural starting point for a semiclassical analysis in terms of classical complex orbits .",
    "the simplest situation occurs when the tunnelling doublet is made of the two lowest energies  @xmath39 of the spectrum .",
    "if  @xmath40 denotes the energy difference between the nearest excited states and  @xmath41 ( for the double well potential @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the classical frequency around the stable equilibrium points ) , by giving a sufficiently large imaginary part to  @xmath44 , @xmath45 we can safely retain the @xmath46 terms only , which exponentially dominate the trace of  . to be valid , this approximation requires that we remain away from a quantum resonance where the definition of the tunnelling doublet is made ambiguous by the presence of a third energy level in the neighborhood of  @xmath47 and  @xmath48 .",
    "then we have immediately @xmath49 when the tunnelling splitting is smaller than  @xmath40 by several orders of magnitude , we can work with a complex time such that @xmath50 remains compatible with condition   and , therefore , @xmath51 will provide a good approximation of the tunnelling splitting for a wide range of  @xmath52 . though condition   is widely fulfilled in many situations",
    "this is not an essential condition since one can keep working with @xmath53 .",
    "numerically , the estimation   has also the advantage of obviating a diagonalization .",
    "when we want to compute a splitting , due to tunnelling , between an arbitrary doublet , the selection of the corresponding terms in the right hand side of   can be made with an operator  @xmath54 that will mimic the ( _ a priori _ unknown ) projector  @xmath55 .",
    "it will be chosen such that its matrix elements are localised in the regions of phase - space where  @xmath25 are dominant . under the soft condition",
    "@xmath56 , we will therefore take @xmath57 the localization condition on the matrix elements of  @xmath54 is a selection tool that replaces  . in that case",
    ", there is a battle of exponentials between the exponentially small matrix elements  @xmath58 and the time dependent terms  @xmath59 .",
    "the last term would eventually dominate for the lower energy states ( @xmath60 ) if  @xmath61 could be increased arbitrarily .",
    "but once a @xmath62 is given , one expects to recover a good approximation of the excited splitting by increasing  @xmath63 since , when  @xmath64 , we actually recover the real time case .",
    "the next step consists in computing @xmath65 by semiclassical techniques and , then , we will add some more specific prescriptions on the choice of  @xmath52 , in order to improve the accuracy of  @xmath66 .",
    "we will illustrate how this works in the examples of secs .",
