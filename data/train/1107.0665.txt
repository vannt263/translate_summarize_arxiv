    "it is a well - known fact that an emitting source moving at a velocity exceeding the wave - propagation velocity in the medium will induce a shock - wave .",
    "prime examples of this phenomenon are the sonic boom emitted by a super - sonic airplane , a bow - wave from a moving ship , and cherenkov radiation emitted by an electric charge moving at almost the vacuum speed of light in a medium with an appreciable index of refraction . in this work we show that a similar effect occurs in the emission from a fast moving electric current .",
    "it is suggested that this effect manifests itself in the emission of electromagnetic waves from particle cascades in the atmosphere of the earth initiated by ultra - high energy ( uhe ) cosmic rays , with energies in excess of @xmath0ev .",
    "an uhe cosmic ray entering the atmosphere of the earth creates a cascade of particles , called an extensive air shower ( eas ) . in this cascade",
    "there are copious amounts ( @xmath1 , depending on the initial energy of the cosmic ray ) of electrons and positrons forming a small plasma cloud .",
    "this cloud , with a typical size of less than 1 m , moves with almost the light velocity towards earth .",
    "the magnetic field of the earth , by means of the lorentz force , induces a drift velocity for the leptons which is perpendicular to the direction of the initial cosmic ray and opposite for electrons and positrons . as a result",
    "an electric current is created in the fast moving plasma cloud .",
    "the strength of the induced electric current is roughly proportional to the number of charged particles in the plasma cloud as the induced drift velocity is varying little with height .",
    "this macroscopic picture  @xcite was recently confirmed  @xcite to agree with a microscopic description  @xcite .",
    "even when the index of refraction of air would be equal to that of vacuum this varying electric current emits electromagnetic waves and coherent emission occurs at a wavelength longer than the size of the charge cloud , i.e.  for radio frequencies @xmath2mhz  @xcite .",
    "the geomagnetic emission mechanism  @xcite has been confirmed from data  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the induced current the plasma cloud has a net charge excess which also radiates .",
    "the polarization direction of radiation distinguishes the emission due to the charge excess and the geomagnetic current  @xcite .",
    "since charge - excess radiation is generally smaller in intensity we will concentrate in this work on geomagnetic emission .    as is well known the propagation speed of electromagnetic waves is @xmath3 where @xmath4 denotes the velocity of light in vacuum . in this work",
    "we investigate the effect of the index of refraction of air , @xmath5 , on the emission following ref .",
    "the effects of cherenkov radiation from eas have also been addressed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this work",
    "we show that for realistic values for @xmath5 the cherenkov effect introduces distinct features in the ground pattern of the emitted radiation .",
    "as described , a cosmic ray entering the atmosphere induces an eas , a plasma cloud moving at almost the light velocity , where the magnetic field of the earth induces a net electric current in the plasma  @xcite . from classical electrodynamics",
    "@xcite we obtain the linard - wiechert potentials for a point source following a trajectory @xmath6 and an observer at rest at @xmath7 , a^_pl(t,-(t))= _ t = t , [ eq : vec - pl ] where @xmath8 denotes the retarded time corresponding to the time the signal was emitted from the moving charge distribution and @xmath9 is the retarded distance  @xcite . in the point - like approximation ( denoted by @xmath10 ) where the size of the plasma cloud is infinitesimal the four - current is , j^_pl(t,)=j^(t)^3(-(t ) ) , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 carries a longitudinal component due to the net charge excess ( which we will ignore ) and a transverse component due to the opposite drift of electrons and positrons induced by the earth magnetic field .",
    "the transverse component is proportional to the number of charged particles at a given height , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the distance to the earth s surface as measured along the shower path .    the electromagnetic fields at the observer are given as , e^i&=&c(^ia^0-^0 a^i ) , [ eq : e - field ] at @xmath15 , and where at @xmath16 the shower hits the earth .",
    "the distance @xmath17 is equal to the transverse distance to the shower axis .",
    "the velocity of the charge cloud is @xmath18 where we set @xmath19 in the following .",
    "for the special case @xmath20 , the retarded distance @xmath21 reduces to @xmath22 which is finite .    the retarded time is defined by the light - cone condition @xmath23 where the distance @xmath24 is the optical path length between the source located at @xmath25 and the observer at @xmath26 .",

    "[ fig : trett ] the emission height , @xmath14 , is plotted as a function of the observer time @xmath30 for an observer 100 m from the shower axis for three choices for the index of refraction @xmath5 . for the case",
    "@xmath20 the plot of the retarded time ( red drawn curve ) shows that the retarded time is a single valued function and that the earliest signals come from the top of the shower . for an index of refraction deviating from unity ( @xmath33 , @xmath27 ) the function is composed out of several branches ( dashed - magenta and dotted - blue curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : trett ] ) limited by the critical times @xmath34 , where the derivative @xmath35 becomes infinite . in  @xcite it was already shown that a singularity in this derivative is related to a singularity in our vector potential since @xmath36 .",
    "this singularity ( the branch point ) is well known and corresponds to cherenkov emission .",

    "@xmath38 is given as , c t_c = d , [ eq : tk ] with corresponding retarded time @xmath39 .",
    "the retarded time can readily be converted into an emission height @xmath40 and it can be seen that the expressions are consistent with the expression of the angle for cherenkov emission , @xmath41 . for the general case it has to be calculated numerically .    to calculate the realistic pulse form for @xmath42",
    "it is essential to include the fact that the emitting plasma cloud has a finite size , a^_w(t , ) = d^2 dh ( h , ) a^_pl(t,- ) [ eq : vec - pot ] where @xmath43 is the relative transverse coordinate to the shower axis and the source is at the position @xmath44 .",
    "the density profile is parameterized as  @xcite w(r , h)=2r ( h,)= n ( r+r_0)^-3.5 h e^-2h / l at a fixed shower time @xmath8 and where @xmath45 is the longitudinal distance from the shower front that , by definition , moves with the vacuum speed of light @xmath4 .",
    "the normalization constant , @xmath46 , is chosen such that @xmath47 .",

    "the parameters are taken as @xmath50 m , @xmath51 m following the results of simulations using the cascade mode of the conex - mc - geo shower simulation and analysis package  @xcite .",
    "the results of these simulations indicate that the pancake thickness parameter @xmath28 has to be considerably smaller than the value of @xmath52 m used in previous calculations  @xcite . retaining the terms pertinent to geomagnetic radiation and using partial integration to have the derivatives in operate on the density distribution",
    "exclusively , the electromagnetic field can be expressed as [ eq : e - field - full ] e^i = - d^2 dh ( j^i_pl + w ) .",
    "the complication in is now reduced to the integration of inverse square - root divergencies over smoothly varying functions giving finite results .",

    "essential for the structure of the pulse is the longitudinal shower profile @xmath55 , as shown by the thinly - dotted black curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : trett ] .    for the case that @xmath20",
    "the denominator @xmath9 is a smoothly changing function over the integration regime and the dominant contribution is derived from the last term in . since the derivative of the shower profile reaches a maximum at @xmath56 km it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : trett ] that the peak of the pulse occurs at @xmath57ns which agrees with the result in fig .",
    "[ fig : gm - r0-d100 ] .",
    "the integral of the first term , being a derivative , almost vanishes .",
    "for the cases that @xmath42 the reasoning is rather different .",
    "the denominator @xmath9 vanishes at the cherenkov time , indicated by the vertical arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig : trett ] , and thus @xmath58 varies strongly as function of @xmath45 .",
    "the contribution from the first term in the integral is large ( in contrast to the case @xmath20 ) and results in an enhanced contribution from the corresponding emission height .",
    "the pulse height will thus be proportional to @xmath59 while the peak is observed a little after @xmath38 in agreement with the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gm - r0-d100 ] .",
    "since @xmath60 is large for @xmath53 m this results in a strong pulse .",

    "the refractivity is equal to @xmath61 at ground level and decreases exponentially with height , @xmath62 .",
    "the values of the retarded time thus lie in between those obtained with @xmath20 and @xmath33 and are shown as the dotted - blue curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : trett ] .",
    "also for this case there is a clear cherenkov time which is slightly smaller than that for @xmath33 resulting is a very similar pulse as for the case of a fixed - finite @xmath5 .",

    "as expressed in the discussion following emission at the cherenkov angle @xmath63 relates a distance @xmath64 from the shower core to a particular emission height . for an observer close to the shower , @xmath65 m ,",
    "this cherenkov height lies well below the shower maximum where @xmath55 has fallen considerably and the intensity of the emitted radiation is low .",
    "it increases with increasing distance to reach a maximum around @xmath53 m where the cherenkov point lies at the height of the shower maximum . at even larger distances",
    "the cherenkov point lies above the shower maximum and the amplitude decreases rapidly .",
    "the position of the cherenkov maximum thus reflects the shower maximum and is thus sensitive for the composition of the cosmic ray .",
    "for @xmath20 the main strength of the pulse is emitted at the height where the derivative of the shower profile is large .",
    "since the retarded distance , @xmath66 , corresponding to this height in the shower evolution increases for observers further away from the shower core , the amplitude of the pulse is a monotonically decreasing function with distance .",
    "calculations confirm that for charge - excess radiation ( not reported here ) the effect of the index of refraction is very similar as for geomagnetic radiation where there are subtle differences due to the somewhat different weighting over shower height . for the chosen geometry",
    "the geomagnetic effect is however dominant .",
    "this shows that the cherenkov effect applies equally to radiation from a moving charge , to which it is usually applied , as to that from a moving electric current , which is at the focus here .",
    "the polarization of the radio signal , which distinguishes geomagnetic and charge - excess radiation , is not affected by the cherenkov effect .",
    "the principal signature of the cherenkov effect is that the pulse at a certain distance , 100 m for the present example , is considerably larger than it would have been for the case that @xmath20 .",
    "this feature is especially clear from fig .",

    "the pulse height diverges for the case of @xmath20 where it should be noted that this divergence is strongly dependent on the pancake thickness parameter @xmath28 , smaller values give a stronger divergence at @xmath67 .",
    "apart from an overall scaling factor the picture is not affected by @xmath28 for @xmath68 m . for the realistic case where @xmath42 a marked deviation is predicted with a clear enhancement in peak intensity at distances ranging from 50 till about 100 m from the core .",

    "[ fig : gm - r - dph ] , an increase of the amplitude of the geomagnetic radiation with distance for @xmath70 instead of the monotonic decrease predicted for @xmath20 , remains for showers at a large angle with the vertical .",
    "for these inclined showers the shower maximum will occur at a larger values of @xmath31 , the distance to the point of impact on earth , and the maximum in the intensity will thus be observed at larger distances from the shower core , consistent with the angle for cherenkov emission .",
    "some hints of this effect may have been seen in recent results from the lopes  @xcite collaboration showing that for certain events the pulse height follows the trend shown by the dotted - blue line in fig .",
    "[ fig : gm - r - dph ] .",
    "more detailed measurements are necessary where full attention is given to polarization observables which are crucial to distinguish geomagnetic and charge - excess radiation .",
