    "blue light emitting diodes ( leds ) , which represent key constituents of commercial white leds , have spurred considerable interest in recent years due to their exceptionally low power consumption and long life span .",
    "however , boosting their power conversion efficiency ( pce ) in order to reduce the cost remains a tantalizing goal . in leds ,",
    "the pce is proportional to the external quantum efficiency ( eqe ) , which is the product of the internal quantum efficiency ( iqe ) and the light extraction efficiency ( lee )  @xcite . since the iqe is proportional to the ratio of the number of radiated recombined electron - hole  ( e - h ) pairs over the number of all the recombined e - h pairs , it highly depends on the spontaneous emission rate ( ser ) .",
    "specifically , the enhancements of iqe and ser are related as  @xcite    @xmath0    where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the internal quantum efficiencies of the modified and reference leds , respectively , while @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the spontaneous emission rates of the modified and reference leds , respectively . according to eq .  , for a given value of @xmath2 , higher @xmath5 ( or lower @xmath6 ) results in higher @xmath7 , so that enhancing @xmath7 essentially corresponds in enhancing @xmath5 .",
    "thus , the pce enhancement factor is    @xmath8    and maximizing the pce essentially requires maximizing both the lee and the ser .",
    "this represents a challenging task because lee and ser involve totally different physics , so that trade - offs may have to be made .",
    "lee is typically impaired by the trapping of emitted photons within the active regions of the led due to sharp refractive index contrast between the semiconductor medium ( e.g. gan , si ) and air .",
    "many methods have been reported to mitigate this issue by increasing the escape cone using for instance distributed bragg reflectors ( dbr )  @xcite , textured surfaces  @xcite or photonic crystals  @xcite .",
    "ser depends on the atomic structure of the emitter and on the density of electromagnetic modes of the environment  @xcite .",
    "while the former is fixed for a given material , the latter may be enhanced by some reported methods such as coupling dipolar emission modes to resonant cavity modes  @xcite or by matching the emission frequency to surface plasmon polaritons  @xcite .",
    "metamaterials , which are artificial materials consisting of subwavelength arrangements of scattering inclusions in a host medium , can transform electromagnetic fields by changing their phase , amplitude and polarization in specified manners , and hence support many novel phenomena such as for instance negative refraction  @xcite , cloaking  @xcite , and light freezing  @xcite .",
    "in particular , multilayered hyperbolic metamaterials have been recently reported as a novel approach for enhancing ser due to the infinite local density of state ( ldos ) provided by their theoretically unlimited dispersion volume  @xcite . however , this approach is practically limited by the restricted thinness of the layers , causing bragg scattering dispersion restriction , and requires complex designs , such as for instance grating structures  @xcite , to transform intrinsic lateral emission into vertical radiation for high lee .",
    "metasurfaces are much easier to fabricate than their 3d metamaterial counterparts and may perform a great diversity of electromagnetic transformations , such as for instance generalized refraction  @xcite and vortex wave generation  @xcite .",
    "they are particularly suited to control fields in layered structures , since they can be conveniently stacked over such structures . in this work ,",
    "we propose , synthesize and numerically demonstrate a novel blue led structure with two metasurfaces forming a partially - reflecting metasurface cavity ( prmc ) and leading to maximal pce .",
    "this is achieved by simultaneously enhancing the lee , by suppressing wave trapping , and the ser , by concentrating fields near the emitter .",
    "we consider here the case of gallium nitride ( gan ) leds , given their prominent role in commercial applications , but the proposed concept naturally applies to the other semiconductors , such as silicon ( si ) , with parameter adjustments .",
    "figure  [ fig : illustration](a ) shows the cross - section of a typical gan led , with pad contacts , transparent contact layer , light emitting layer sandwiched between the p - gan and n - gan layers , metal backreflector and substrate . since the transparent contact layer usually has a refractive index close to that of air , it may be ignored .",
    "the light emitting layer thickness , being in the order of a few tens of nanometers , may also be ignored .",
    "the backreflector , which is highly reflective ( typically dbr or silver layer ) , may be modeled as a perfect electric conductor ( pec ) sheet .",
    "moreover , we shall replace the light emitting layer by a simple dipole to simplify the forthcoming synthesis of the metasurfaces . finally ,",
    "since the refractive indices of p - gan and n - gan are very close to that of pure gan , they can be merged in a single one with the index of pure gan . as a result of all these simplifications , the structure in fig .",
    "[ fig : illustration](a ) , for simulation purpose , reduces to that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : illustration](b ) , consisting to a unique layer of pure gan with a dipole quantum emitter position at distances @xmath9 and @xmath10 from the air interface and backreflector , respectively , representing an infinitesimal element of the light emitting layer , on a perfect backreflector .",
    "assuming blue led ( @xmath11  @xmath12 ) , @xmath13 @xmath12 ( @xmath14 ) is much smaller than the total thickness of the gan layer ( @xmath15 m ) and therefore ray optics may be applied as a heuristic tool to describe electromagnetic field propagation in the structure . as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : illustration](b ) , the field emitted by the dipole may be decomposed , for later comparison , into a direct field , @xmath16 , directly propagating towards the gan - air interface and scattered at it , and an indirect field , @xmath17 , first reflected on the backreflector .",
    "note that @xmath17 can be considered as the field produced by a mirror dipole according to image theory . due to the large contrast of refractive indices , the escape angle from gan to air ,",
    "according to snell law , is only @xmath18 , which leads to massive guided - mode loss , with most of the dipole emission energy trapped within the gan layer and little radiated out . as a result",
    ", such a configuration suffers from poor lee , and hence poor pce .",
    "the small amount of radiated energy may be maximized by setting the parameters @xmath19 so as to satisfy the fabry - perot conditions for both the direct and indirect waves , but this is largely insufficient given the amount of lost energy in trapped waves .",

    "[ fig : illustration](d ) .",
    "the front ( top in the figure ) metasurface ( ms1 ) is a partially - reflecting metasurface placed at the gan - air interface , while the back ( bottom in the figure ) metasurface ( ms2 ) is a completely reflective metasurface placed between the gan layer and the backreflector . to avoid plasmonic losses ,",
    "the metasurfaces should be ideally implemented in all - dielectric metasurface technology  @xcite .",
    "the prmc structure essentially operates as follows .",
    "ms1 normally refracts the direct dipole field , @xmath16 , for all incidence angles , into part of the plane - wave transmitted field , @xmath21 , and normally reflects @xmath16 into the field @xmath22 .",
    "ms2 normally reflects the indirect field , @xmath17 , for all incidence angles , into the field @xmath23 , and transmits this field to complete @xmath21 . since all the light rays , including those above @xmath24 in the case of fig .",
    "[ fig : illustration](b ) , are converted to normal rays , wave trapping within the gan layer is completely suppressed , so that a much higher lee level may be expected . on the other hand ,",
    "ser maximization requires the dipole emitter to be placed at an antinode of the standing wave formed in the prmc along the @xmath25-direction to leverage the purcell effect  @xcite .",
    "if the reflection phase shifts induced by ms1 ( @xmath26 ) and ms2 ( @xmath27 ) were zero , this would correspond to simultaneously satisfying the resonance condition    [ eq : pos_ser ] @xmath28 and the antinode position condition , which taking into account  , reads @xmath29    however , the situation is more complicated because one also needs to maximize the constructive interference of the waves transmitted by the direct and indirect fields , in @xmath21 , for maximal lee . in terms of the ray scheme , this would imply the constructive interference of an infinite number of direct ( d ) and indirect ( i ) wave sets , such as for instance , with reference to fig .",
    "[ fig : illustration](c ) ,    [ eq : ci_lee ] @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33    where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are integers .",
    "naturally , these conditions can not be all simultaneously satisfied , given the finite number of design parameters , and they are electromagnetically not exact anyways .",
    "however , they suggest that optimal lee should correspond to a design where fields would form light rings at the positions of maximal constructive interference ( points @xmath36 ) . in a real design , this optimum",
    "will be found by full - wave electromagnetic simulation .",
    "specifically , we will enforce @xmath37 and tune @xmath27 and @xmath38 ( transmission phase of ms1 ) so as to achieve an optimal design in terms of both lee and ser , i.e. to maximize the overall led pce .",
    "the full - wave simulations will be performed using the comsol finite element method ( fem ) commercial software , where the metasurface is modeled as a deeply sub - wavelength slab with volume susceptibility @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the thickness of the slab  @xcite .",
    "given the high density of the fem mesh required in the metasurface - modeling slab and around the ( point ) dipole , the actual 3d problem is not tractable on a standard computer .",
    "therefore , it will be reduced to a 2d model ( @xmath41 ) , without altering the key conclusions in terms of fundamental comparison between the bare led and prmc led structures .    in order to transform the incident field into reflected and transmitted fields as specified above",
    ", an efficient metasurface synthesis technique is required .",
    "various metasurface synthesis methods have been recently reported , including methods based on polarizabilities  @xcite , impedance tensors  @xcite , momentum transformation  @xcite and surface susceptibility tensor  @xcite .",
    "we will use here the last of these techniques , which can handle full vectorial electromagnetic fields and provide closed - form solutions for quasi - arbitrary wave transformations .",
    "this technique will be applied to determine the initial surface susceptibility functions of the metasurfaces ms1 and ms2 in fig .",
    "[ fig : illustration](d ) , namely @xmath42 and @xmath43 , for generating the normal scattered waves indicated fig .",
    "[ fig : illustration](c ) .",
    "being deeply sub - wavelength in thickness , a metasurface can be considered as a zero - thickness discontinuity of space , and may then be generally modeled by the generalized sheet transition conditions ( gstcs )  @xcite    [ eq : gstc ] @xmath44 @xmath45    where the symbol @xmath46 refers to the difference of the electromagnetic fields @xmath47 between the two sides of the metasurface ( e.g. @xmath48 ) , and @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the electric and magnetic polarization densities , respectively .    in general , a metasurface may induce electromagnetic couplings , in which case it is described by the bianisotropic constitutive relations @xmath51 and @xmath52 , where the subscript `` '' denotes the average of the fields at the two sides of the metasurfaces ( e.g. @xmath53/2,~u = x , y , z$ ] ) .",
    "however , since active layer materials ( e.g. gan , si ) in optoelectronic devices are typically isotropic , we set @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "furthermore , we will seek the simplest possible design , assuming @xmath56 , in which case eqs .",
    "yield the closed - form surface susceptibilities    [ eq : susceptibilities ] @xmath57    @xmath58    in the 2d model represented by fig .",
    "[ fig : illustration ] , we consider a @xmath59-directed electric source ( infinite line source ) , corresponding to s - polarization .",
    "this is in fact still a complicated problem , where complex multiple scattering coupling exists between the two metasurfaces .",
    "therefore , as an initial design approach , we shall consider the two surfaces as uncoupled and only transforming all incident fields into normal fields .",
    "coupling coherence will be ensured by setting the parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 , as previously mentioned , and by full - wave optimizing the entire structure .",

    "similar relations are naturally obtained for the case of a @xmath59-directed magnetic source , corresponding to p - polarization .",
    "note that , given the complex nature of the involved fields , the surface susceptibilities in eqs .   and eqs .   will strongly depend on @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) , so that the response of the prmc structure will strongly depend on the relative position of the metasurface with respect to the emitter . in order to find the scattering particles producing the synthesized susceptibilities in eqs .   and eqs .  , one first converts surface susceptibilities into scattering parameters  ( s - parameters )  @xcite , which yields in our problem    [ eq : s_parameters ]    @xmath67    @xmath68    where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the intrinsic impedances of air and gan , respectively .",

    "the prmc led clearly produces a much higher directivity  ( half - power beamwidth equals to @xmath107 ) than that the bare led , which can not be clearly defined given its absence of clear maximum .",
    "this is naturally due to the fact that the exit ray angles in the prmc led are normal to the structure whereas those in the bare led are almost grazing on the led surface .",
