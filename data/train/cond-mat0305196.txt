    "research on quantum spin ladders continues to attract considerable attention from both theoretical and experimental points of view due to their relevance to a large number of low - dimensional materials , such as particular cuprates and organic compounds @xcite , among others .",
    "initially , most of the theoretical results concerning ladder systems were obtained from the standard heisenberg ladder .",
    "subsequently , other models with generalized interactions have been proposed . in this context , nersesyan and",
    "tsvelik @xcite introduced a spin ladder model incorporating a biquadratic spin exchange interaction term , which , when sufficiently strong , exhibits new dimerized phases @xcite .",
    "various ladder models have been developed by an extension of the symmetry algebra @xcite .",
    "a special case of the nersesyan - tsvelik model @xcite was proposed later by wang @xcite .",
    "this model , based on the @xmath5 symmetry algebra , is exactly solvable by bethe ansatz methods and exhibits a spin gap in the spectrum of elementary triplet excitations , a necessary condition for superconductivity to occur under hole doping .",
    "in addition , it was recently observed @xcite that this model can be used to describe some physical properties of different types of two - leg ladder compounds , such as cu@xmath0(c@xmath1h@xmath2n@xmath3)@xmath3cl@xmath4 @xcite , ( c@xmath1h@xmath2n)@xmath3cubr@xmath6 @xcite , ( 5iap)@xmath3cubr@xmath7h@xmath3o @xcite and kcucl@xmath8 , tlcucl@xmath8 @xcite . in the absence of a magnetic field",
    "the model exhibits three quantum phases , while in the presence of a strong magnetic field there is a gapped phase in the regime @xmath9 , a fully polarized gapped phase for @xmath10 and a luttinger liquid magnetic phase in the regime @xmath11 .",
    "this observation suggests that the physical properties of the ladder compounds can be accessed via the well - established knowledge of integrable systems .    on the other hand",
    ", the effect of boundary impurities and defects also plays an important role in quasi - one dimensional systems . an integrable @xmath5 spin ladder model with a boundary defect",
    "has been proposed and investigated recently through bethe ansatz methods @xcite .",
    "this model , however , is just a particular case of a more general family of exactly solvable ladder models based on the @xmath5 symmetry algebra that can be constructed from more general types of bounday conditions .",
    "basically , by this strategy , a set of equations to deal with the boundaries , called reflection equations ( re ) are introduced @xcite .",
    "the solutions of these equations @xcite , referred to as @xmath12-matrices , in turn introduce boundary interactions into the hamiltonian of the system , in such a manner that integrability is preserved .",
    "the boundary interaction terms in spin ladder models may be realized by impurity doping at the ends of the ladder .",
    "impurity doping in a spin ladder system with a spin gap has been performed @xcite .",
    "substantial change in macroscopic properties such as enhancement in spin correlations and magnetic susceptibilities are observed in the low impurity concentration region .",
    "the boundary impurity doping may change the critical behaviour at the boundaries of the ladder systems .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present a complete family of integrable spin ladder systems based on the @xmath5 symmetry algebra with boundary impurities in a systematic way .",
    "an analytic analysis of the thermodynamic properties of these models is then performed by means of the thermodynamic bethe ansatz ( tba ) method and , in particular , the effect of these impurities on the free energy , the susceptibility and the magnetization is discussed .",
    "so far , the results obtained provide a clear interpretation of the impurity effects in the low temperature regime of an integrable open spin ladder system",
    ".    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    ", we present the su(4 ) solution of the ybe and solve the corresponding re .",
    "furthermore , we give the explicit expressions for the hamiltonian with different types of boundary defects .",
    "section [ sec3 ] is devoted to the derivation of the bethe - ansatz solution by means of the quantum inverse scattering method ( qism ) .",
    "the reader more interested in the physics of the model may choose to skip section [ sec3 ] . in section [ sec4",
    "] , the ground state properties , the quantum phase diagram and the boundary impurity effects are studied via the tba .",
    "a summary and discussion of our main results is given in section [ sec5 ] .",
    "let us begin by introducing the integrable spin ladder model based on the @xmath5 symmetry with boundary fields , @xmath13 where the leg part consists of heisenberg exchange and four - spin interaction terms @xmath14 the left ( right ) boundary terms @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) depend on arbitrary parameters @xmath17 and are given by @xmath18 in the above @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the standard spin@xmath21 operators acting on site @xmath22 of the upper and lower legs , respectively , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the intrachain and interchain couplings ( see figure 1 ) and @xmath25 is the length of the ladder .",
    "it is worth noticing that @xmath26 is a rescaling constant which can be used to minimize the biquadratic term such that the quantum phase of the model ( [ ham ] ) lies in the same haldane spin liquid phase as that of the conventional spin ladder ( see section [ sec4 ] ) .",
    "+    notice that the boundary terms corresponding to the first case ( @xmath27 ) in ( [ ham - bt-1 ] ) and ( [ ham - bt-2 ] ) act as heisenberg - type rung couplings , whereas in the second case ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) they act as a @xmath30-component spin interaction with boundary magnetic fields . in the third ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) and",
    "fourth ( @xmath33 ) cases , they act as a combination of heisenberg - type rung coupling and @xmath30-component spin interaction with boundary magnetic fields . in the last case ( @xmath34 ) only the @xmath30-component spin interaction terms survive .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) thus contains five different types of boundary rung interactions at each edge of the ladder realizing different impurity dopings .",
    "this leads to twenty five possible choices of boundary impurities .",
    "the rung interaction in the bulk was , as usual , introduced by the chemical potential terms given by @xmath35 in the canonical basis @xmath36 .",
    "the rung states split into a singlet and a triplet denoted by @xmath37 respectively .",
    "the leg interaction part of the hamiltonian ( [ leg - int ] ) does not change under the basis transformation ( [ basis ] ) .",
    "however , the bulk rung interaction part and the boundary rung interaction terms alter with respect to the choice of the order of singlet and triplet in the basis ( [ basis ] ) .    in order to derive this model",
    "let us begin by recalling the @xmath5 @xmath38-matrix @xmath39 where the elements are given by @xmath40 the quantum @xmath38-matrix ( [ r12 ] ) satisfies the yang - baxter equation ( ybe ) @xmath41 guaranteeing the integrability of the model with periodic bc .",
    "this @xmath38-matrix enjoys the properties @xmath42 where superscript @xmath43 denotes the transposition in the space with index @xmath44 . for other types of boundary conditions ,",
    "the ybe will still account for the integrability of the bulk part of the model , but the boundary terms have to be chosen appropriately in order to preserve the integrability . in particular , the left and right reflection matrices , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively , are required to satisfy the re s @xcite @xmath47 in the above we have introduced the object @xmath48 which may be determined by the relations @xmath49 and we have used the conventional notation @xmath50 where @xmath51 denotes the identity operator on @xmath52 and , as usual , @xmath53 , with @xmath54 being the permutation operator . after a lengthy calculation we find the possible solutions of the re s for the diagonal @xmath55-matrices ( see also ref .",

    "the boundary pairs @xmath79 , @xmath80 , lead to the boundary pair terms @xmath81 and @xmath82 in ( [ ham - bt-1 ] ) and ( [ ham - bt-2 ] ) , whose combination leads to twenty five possible choices of boundary impurities .",
    "a special choice of the boundary term @xmath83 was already investigated in @xcite .",
    "the symmetries enjoyed by the @xmath38-matrix ( [ r12 ] ) and the re s ( [ re1 ] ) and ( [ re2 ] ) constitute the necessary ingredients for the integrability of the model with boundary impurities , due to the fact that the double - row transfer matrix of the system @xmath84,\\label{tm}\\ ] ] commutes for different values of the spectral parameter . here",

    "therefore , it is reasonable to choose the basis order as @xmath288 . subsequently the driving terms are given by @xmath289 , @xmath290 and @xmath291 .",
    "a second critical field @xmath292 ( @xmath293 ) can be determined by the magnetization arriving at its saturation value @xmath294 .",
    "then the reference state becomes the true physical state and the critical field @xmath292 is given by @xmath295 in this case , all the boundary impurities are gapfull with the ferromagnetic gap @xmath296 .",
    "let us now discuss the boundary impurity effects in the vicinity of the critical point @xmath284 .",
    "after a lengthy calculation , similar to that employed in @xcite for the periodic case , we find the free energy in the presence of a strong magnetic field @xmath238 , @xmath297 where @xmath298 is the fermi point given by @xmath299 and @xmath300 is the surface free energy from the boundary impurities in the vicinity of @xmath284 .",
    "explicitly , + for @xmath301 , or say @xmath302 or @xmath303 , it is given by @xmath304 for @xmath305 , or say @xmath306 , we have @xmath307 while for @xmath308 very small , or say @xmath309 , it is given by @xmath310 where @xmath311 in the above @xmath312 and the parameters @xmath313 are related to the boundary impurity coupling @xmath17 by @xmath314 the magnetic susceptibility follows from @xmath315 . here , to illustrate the boundary effects",
    ", we will focus on the discussion of the strong coupling compounds @xmath316 with the boundary impurities in the case @xmath317 .",
    "other regimes can be handled in a similar way .",
    "it is very clear that the stable boundary bound states are exhibited only in the strong ferromagnetic boundary coupling @xmath318 . in eq.([relation ] ) , we emphasize that the mathematical singular points do not exist , or alternatively @xmath319 does not mean that the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ relation ] ) has singular points .",
    "for instance , if @xmath320 , the boundary parameters @xmath321 .",
    "thus the phase factors in the bethe ansatz equations ( [ beth1 ] ) , ( [ beth2 ] ) and ( [ beth3 ] ) are equal to @xmath58 for the case @xmath317 .",
    "in such a case , the model exihibits special symmetry ( the quantum algebra @xmath322 invariant bethe ansatz equations ) which leads to a different expression for the boundary free energy than the above ones . for antiferromagnetic boundary coupling @xmath323",
    ", the susceptibility is given by @xmath324 while for the strong ferromagnetic coupling @xmath325 , with @xmath326 , @xmath327 notice , in both cases , that the susceptibility diverges with the square root of the field in the bulk and in the boundaries .",
    "in addition , the susceptibility at the boundaries is enhanced or decreased by different impurity dopings .",
    "this behaviour is illustrated in figure 2 . from the bethe",
    "ansatz equations , we can also calculate the magnetization in the vicinity of @xmath284 , @xmath328 for antiferromagnetic boundary coupling @xmath323 this expression reduces to @xmath329 while for strong ferromagnetic boundary coupling @xmath330 with @xmath331 , @xmath332    a plot of the magnetization @xmath333 against the magnetic field for different boundary impurities @xmath17 is given in figure 3 . by analyzing both figures we can observe the competition between the boundary impurities and the magnetic field in the thermodynamic properties . in particular , we find an enhancement of the susceptibility in the weak anti- and ferromagnetic regimes ( we consider the sizes @xmath334 , the impurity concentration @xmath60 percent ) .",
    "the susceptibility and the magnetization are lifted slightly in the weak antiferromagnetic boundary regime in the case of open boundary conditions , whereas they contribute negatively to the bulk when @xmath17 becomes more and more negative .",
    "this is reasonable , since negative @xmath17 energetically favours the singlet state ( recall the boundary terms in the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) ) , even if the magnetic field is very strong , such that the spin-@xmath58 component of the triplet is involved in the ground state .",
    "the point is that a very negative @xmath17 can overcome the spin-@xmath58 component of the triplet and dominate the edge rung state . in this circumstance ,",
    "the edge state is a pure singlet state and the edge magnetization ( [ sz1 ] ) is zero due to the fact that @xmath17 effectively decreases the edge magnetic field @xmath238 to @xmath284 such that the fermi boundary @xmath335 .",
    "this results in negative susceptibility and magnetization contributions to the bulk .",
    "in contrast to this case , the ferromagnetic impurities lift the susceptibility and the magnetization in the weak coupling regime @xmath336 .",
    "when @xmath17 becomes larger , the triplet edge state is energetically favoured so that the boundary coupling can overcome the magnetic field to bring the three components of the triplet into the edge states .",
    "therefore it causes a negative contribution to the bulk susceptibility and magnetization .",
    "this situation is different from the case of the bulk impurities , where the susceptibility is increased by the impurity coupling due to the forward - scattering .",
    "this fact can be seen clearly from the one point correlation function of the ground state at the edges , for antiferromagnetic boundary coupling and weak ferromagnetic boundary coupling , i.e. @xmath337 , @xmath338 and for ferromagnetic impurities in the strong coupling regime @xmath339 , @xmath340-\\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{\\gamma u_{\\pm}}{j_{\\parallel}})^2}.\\label{cf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above @xmath341 .",
    "the boundary one point correlation functions are given by @xmath342 here @xmath343 and @xmath344 are the probabilities of the singlet and triplet state respectively .",
    "this is because the eigenvalue of the one point correlation function @xmath345 acting on the singlet ( triplet ) state is @xmath346 ( @xmath347 ) .",
    "we have plotted the correlation function for antiferromagnetic boundary coupling in figure 4 .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "we see that the magnetic field always lifts the spin-@xmath58 triplet component .",
    "however , in the case of antiferromagnetic boundary impurities and open boundaries the singlet state is favoured as long as @xmath17 becomes more negative , the triplet moves out of the edge state and the one point correlation function tends to @xmath346 . on the other hand , for ferromagnetic coupling impurities ( see figure 5 ) , the correlation function increases due to the ferromagnetic properties and the magnetic field in the weak coupling regime @xmath348",
    ". however , if @xmath17 becomes larger , the three components of the triplet get involved in the edge state , such that the correlation function tends to @xmath347 for strong ferromagneitc impurity coupling .",
    "this result indicates that the edge state can be a pure singlet state in the strong antiferromagnetic boundary coupling regime whereas it turns out to be a pure triplet state in the strong ferromagnetic boundary coupling regime .",
    "this reveals the role of anti- and ferromagnetic impurities .    on the other hand , the boundary impurities coupled to the spin degrees of freedom ,",
    "namely , @xmath349 and @xmath350 will also affect the ground state properties non - trivially . from the free energy ( [ feg ] ) , these impurity densities will contribute to the low energy .",
    "considering the case @xmath243 , in the absence of the magnetic field , the triplet is completely degenerate while the fermi surface of the singlet is lifted as @xmath24 becomes more negative .",
    "certainly , if @xmath351 the singlet rung state is not involved in the ground - state , namely @xmath352 , whereas two triplet fermi seas still have fermi boundaries at infinity .",
    "under such a configuration , the dressed energy potentials are @xmath353 the free energy can be given by @xmath354 where @xmath355 the first part in ( [ freee ] ) is nothing but the standard @xmath131 ground state energy of the bulk .",
    "the remaining part is the boundary surface energy for various boundary impurities .",
    "in summary , we have discussed in detail the algebraic bethe - ansatz solution of an integrable spin ladder system based on the @xmath5 symmetry with boundary impurities .",
    "five different classes of solutions of the graded re leading to different boundary rung interactions in the hamiltonian were obtained .",
    "the bethe - ansatz equations , the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix and the energy spectrum were given explicitly .",
    "furthermore , the three - level transfer matrices , characterizing the different flavour sectors separately , allowed us to embed different impurities into the system .",
    "from the bethe ansatz solutions ( [ tbethe1])-([tbethe3 ] ) , we found that the boundary impurity effects characterized by @xmath356 , @xmath357 and @xmath358 act indeed non trivially on the densities of roots for the three rapidities and thus change the ground state properties , the boundary bound states as well as the low - lying energy spectrum . in the thermodynamic limit , the spin gap remains almost unchanged .",
    "however , the boundary susceptitblity and magnetization reveal novel magnetic properties for strong and weak impurity couplings . in strong impurity coupling",
    ", the impurities induced by the open boundary conditions can result in either a pure triplet or a singlet edge state due to the nature of the pure back - scattering at the edges and the magnetic impurities .",
    "strictly speaking , the edge state can be a pure singlet state in a strong antiferromagnetic boundary coupling regime whereas a triplet state with an effective magnetic moment can exist in a strong ferromagnetic boundary coupling regime .",
    "correspondingly , the one point correlation function for strong antiferromagnetic boundary impurities tends to the singlet eigenvalue @xmath346 , whereas for strong ferromagneitc impurity coupling it tends to the triplet eigenvalue @xmath347 .",
    "this behaviour may be observed in experiments due to different boundary magnetic moments .",
    "although the tba solution of the @xmath5 ladder model ( [ ham ] ) predicts the quantum phase diagram in good agreement with experimental results for the strong coupling compounds , the full finite temperature thermodynamic properties of the model remain to be calculated .",
