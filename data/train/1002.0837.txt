    "quantifying the total energetics and the time evolution of the dust properties of high - redshift galaxies requires an understanding of the extent to which the locally calibrated relations between mid - infrared ( rest - frame @xmath14  @xmath1 m ) and bolometric luminosity apply at high redshift .",
    "the _ spitzer _",
    "space telescope allows for a direct measure of the mid - ir dust emission from typical ( @xmath12 ) galaxies at @xmath15 and has motivated a number of investigations of the correlation between mid - ir and bolometric luminosity .",
    "the mid - ir emission from @xmath16  @xmath1 m ( rest - frame ) arises from the stochastic uv photo - heating of small dust grains and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ; e.g. , @xcite ) . as such",
    ", this emission is found to correlate with the uv radiation from ob stars and hence the global star formation rate in nearby galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , albeit with some variation depending on metallicity and ionizing hardness ( e.g. , @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite demonstrate for the local _ singss _ sample of galaxies the general agreement between balmer - decrement dust - corrected h@xmath0 star formation rates and those derived by combining tracers of obscured star formation , including ir and @xmath14  @xmath1 m luminosity , and tracers of unobscured star formation ( observed h@xmath0 luminosity ) .    at high redshift",
    ", several studies suggest that on average the ratios of mid to total infrared luminosity for luminous @xmath17  @xmath1m - selected star - forming galaxies at @xmath4 are larger than those found for local galaxies with similar bolometric luminosities @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , x - ray and radio stacking analyses suggest that the correlation between mid - ir and infrared luminosity for the less luminous but more typical galaxies at @xmath4 ( i.e. , those with luminosities comparable to @xmath18 or @xmath19 at @xmath4 ; @xcite ) is consistent with the local relations @xcite . taken together",
    ", these results imply a luminosity - dependence in the correlation between mid - ir and bolometric luminosity .",
    "while progress in connecting the dust emission of high - redshift galaxies to their bolometric luminosities can be informative , most @xmath20 galaxies are selected via the efficient uv - dropout technique @xcite and tend to be too faint and at too high redshift to be detected directly via their dust emission .",
    "thus , it has become common to rely on uv - based inferences of the dust attenuation and bolometric star formation rates of @xmath20 galaxies that require some assumption of how the rest - frame uv slope varies with extinction .",
    "the highest redshift where the correlation between uv - slope and dust extinction has been tested for large numbers of spectroscopically - confirmed galaxies is at @xmath4 .",
    "the results suggest that the local relation between uv - slope and extinction remains valid at @xmath4 for galaxies with moderate bolometric luminosities similar to those of luminous infrared galaxies , or lirgs ( @xcite ; hereafter r06 ) .",
    "access to a third tracer of star formation , independent of the uv and ir emission , is required to establish a more secure footing for ( 1 ) the scaling between mid - ir emission and star formation rate and ( 2 ) the dependence of uv - slope on dust extinction .",
    "the most direct probe of young massive star formation is from hii recombination nebular emission .",
    "in particular , the h@xmath0 line has been used traditionally as a star formation rate indicator given its accessibility in the optical window and the fact that it traces star formation on very short timescales ( @xmath21  myr ) and is less sensitive to extinction than uv emission ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "fortunately , h@xmath0 is still accessible with ground - based near - ir spectrographs for galaxies at @xmath4 . using a sample of @xmath22 uv - selected galaxies at @xmath4 with h@xmath0 spectroscopy , @xcite",
    "demonstrate that the h@xmath0 inferred star formation rates agree well with those obtained from the uv after correcting both the h@xmath0 line and the uv continuum magnitude for extinction , and assuming that @xmath23 . in this paper",
    ", we use this h@xmath0 spectroscopic sample as the basis for quantifying independently the scaling between mid - ir emission and star formation rate for moderately - luminous galaxies at @xmath4 . this scaling relation",
    "is then used to infer bolometric luminosities and dust obscuration and determine how the uv slope varies with extinction for typical high - redshift galaxies .",
    "we begin by discussing in   [ sec : selection ] the rest - uv selection , followup optical and near - ir spectroscopy , and the mips observations , data reduction and photometry .",
    "the stellar population modeling of galaxies in our final samples is discussed in   [ sec : sedfit ] .",
    "we then present the correlations between h@xmath0 , x - ray , and @xmath14  @xmath1 m luminosity ( and the connection between these quantities and the star formation rate ) and comparison with other local and high - redshift relations (   [ sec : ha24 ] ) .",
    "the variation of uv slope with dust attenuation is addressed in   [ sec : meurer ] .",
    "the correlation between bolometric luminosity and dust attenuation and the implications of this relationship for the observed uv luminosity are presented in   [ sec : bol ] .",
    "finally , in   [ sec : metals ] we present the results of a comparison between extinction and gas - phase metallicities of star - forming galaxies at @xmath4 and demonstrate a close relationship between the two .",
    "we assume a @xcite imf unless stated otherwise and adopt a cosmology with @xmath24  km  s@xmath25  mpc@xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
    "the photometry and spectroscopic followup for the lyman break galaxy ( lbg ) survey at redshifts @xmath28 are described in @xcite .",
    "briefly , galaxies were photometrically - selected using either the `` bm , '' `` bx , '' or lbg rest - uv color criteria .",
    "a subset of @xmath29 candidates that were spectroscopically - confirmed with keck / lris observations @xcite were targeted with nirspec h or k - band spectroscopy to trace h@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "in addition to the longslit h@xmath0 spectroscopy , we targeted the @xmath30 redshift overdensity in the hs1700 + 64 ( `` q1700 '' ) field @xcite with narrowband br@xmath31 ( @xmath32  @xmath1m/@xmath33  @xmath1 m ) observations that trace h@xmath0 at that redshift .",
    "these images , along with @xmath34-band observations , were obtained with the wide - field infrared camera ( wirc ) on the palomar @xmath35  m telescope .",
    "details on the br@xmath31 imaging reductions , continuum subtraction , and h@xmath0 flux determinations will be provided in a forthcoming paper ( steidel et  al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "briefly , we calibrated the br@xmath31 image by adjusting its zeropoint until the difference between @xmath34 and br@xmath31 magnitude was zero for objects of similar faintness in @xmath34 .",
    "colors were measured in matched isophotal apertures with detection done at @xmath34-band .",
    "we then measured the narrowband fluxes and subtracted the continuum based on the br@xmath31-@xmath34 colors and knowledge of the br@xmath31 filter bandwidth and shape .",
    "photometric and zeropoint uncertainties result in an @xmath36 error in the derived line fluxes .",
    "this procedure resulted in 21 objects with @xmath37  @xmath38 flux limits in h@xmath0 , ranging in flux from @xmath39 to @xmath40  ergs  s@xmath25 .",
    "eleven of these 21 objects also have longslit h@xmath0 observations . combining the longslit and narrowband h@xmath0 samples yields a total number of 116 galaxies in 6 fields that have @xmath17  @xmath1 m coverage and",
    "are spectroscopically confirmed to lie at @xmath41 , where the @xmath17  @xmath1 m data are sensitive to the rest - frame @xmath14  @xmath1 m flux (   [ sec : mips ] ) .",
    "the primary uncertainty in the spectroscopically - derived h@xmath0 fluxes is slit loss .",
    "the overlap of 11 objects between the h@xmath0 longslit and narrowband samples in the q1700 field allows us to quantify this source of error . to assess the degree of [ nii ] contamination of the narrowband fluxes",
    ", we constructed a composite spectrum of the 11 objects with both longslit and narrowband observations . from this composite , we determine a mean ratio of the [ nii]-to - h@xmath0 flux of @xmath42 for these 11 objects . at the redshift of these galaxies ( @xmath30 )",
    ", the br@xmath31 transmission curve will suppress the [ nii ] line by a factor of 0.88 relative to h@xmath0 .",
    "therefore , we expect the average [ nii ] line contamination of the narrowband flux to be @xmath43 , translating to a @xmath44  dex correction in log flux . after taking into account this @xmath45 correction ,",
    "the ratio of the narrowband h@xmath0 flux to the spectroscopic h@xmath0 flux for these 11 objects varies from @xmath46 to @xmath47 , with a median value of @xmath48 and a @xmath49  @xmath38 dispersion around this median value of @xmath50 ( i.e. , a scatter of @xmath51 ) .",
    "this median value is similar to the average slit loss correction factor of @xmath52 suggested by @xcite . for galaxies with near - ir spectroscopic observations",
    "only , we correct the h@xmath0 flux for slit losses by multiplying by the median value found above , @xmath48 .    the sample of 11 galaxies with both longslit and narrowband observations have an h@xmath0 flux distribution that is undistinguished from the distribution for the 90 galaxies that are used to measure the relation between 8 micron luminosity ( @xmath53 ) and @xmath54 .",
    "over this flux range , we find no dependence of the slit loss correction factor with the spectroscopic flux .",
    "the absence of any spectroscopic flux - dependent systematic in the slit loss correction , combined with the expectation that the amount of h@xmath0 flux lost in the spectroscopic observations depends sensitively on the relative placement and position angle of the slit on the galaxy , leads us to the conclusion that the slit loss correction must be dominated by random error .",
    "there are 6 fields in the lbg survey that have _ spitzer _ mips @xmath17  @xmath1 m coverage , including the publicly available data in the goods - n and westphal fields ( dickinson et  al .",
    ", in prep . ;",
    "chary et  al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "we obtained observations in 4 additional lbg fields : q1623 , q1700 , q2343 , and q1549 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "observations in these 4 fields consisted of 30  sec frame times with 2 mapping cycles , where each cycle consists of a @xmath55 dither pattern with a step size of @xmath56 the size of the mips array .",
    "the total exposure time in 3 of the 4 fields is @xmath57  hours , sufficient to detect @xmath58  @xmath1jy sources at @xmath59  @xmath38 ( in the absence of confusion ) within the inner @xmath60 of each field .",
    "this is comparable to the depth of the @xmath17  @xmath1 m data in the goods - n and westphal fields .",
    "the q1700 mips data consist of @xmath61  hrs of observations and reach a @xmath62  @xmath38 depth of @xmath63  @xmath1jy in the absence of confusion .",
    "the @xmath17  @xmath1 m images are processed using a procedure similar to that described in r06 .",
    "briefly , the data are flatfielded and then combined using mopex @xcite .",
    "photometry is extracted using psf photometry with priors determined by the locations of objects detected in the irac images ( irac data exist in all 6 fields ) .",
    "there are three sources of uncertainty in the @xmath17  @xmath1 m fluxes .",
    "the first is background noise , which we determine by fitting psfs simultaneously to random positions around the target of interest and any other known sources .",
    "the dispersion in measurements of the background level obtained in this way is similar to the dispersion we would estimate by comparing the simulated and recovered fluxes of artificial objects added to the @xmath17  @xmath1 m images .",
    "the second source of uncertainty is poisson error and is generally negligible compared to the background dispersion .",
    "the third source of uncertainty is confusion , which is reflected by the degeneracy between the psf fit to the object of interest and the fits to any nearby sources .",
    "the uncertainty in the fit is computed simply from the covariance matrix for the @xmath64 number of objects that are being fit simultaneously .",
    "the total ( normalized ) covariance in the fit ( @xmath65 ) is a number between 0 and 1 , where the former indicates no covariance with nearby objects and the latter indicates total covariance ( e.g. , such as the covariance between the fit of an object and itself ) . for most galaxies in the sample of @xmath66 , @xmath67 .",
    "there are 17 out of 116 galaxies that have @xmath68 .",
    "we consider these sources to be confused and remove them from our sample ; this results in 99 galaxies with secure psf fits .",
    "because we are interested primarily in the star - forming galaxies , we have removed agn from the sample based on ( 1 ) the presence of prominent emission lines including ly@xmath0 , civ , and nv , or ( 2 ) an sed that behaves as a power - law between rest - frame @xmath69  @xmath1 m and @xmath14  @xmath1 m (   [ sec : sedfit ] ) . among the 99 unconfused galaxies in our sample ,",
    "9 are identified as agn .",
    "roughly half of these agn also exhibited high ratios of [ nii]/h@xmath70 .",
    "the fraction of agn ( @xmath71 ) is somewhat larger than the @xmath72 found among typical lbgs to @xmath73 @xcite ; the h@xmath0 spectroscopic sample is biased towards more k - bright galaxies relative to the typical lbg @xcite , and the frequency of agn increases rapidly with increasing _",
    "k_-band brightness at @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the sample used to measure the relationship between mid - ir luminosity and star formation rate consists of 90 galaxies in the h@xmath0 sample ( including spectroscopic and narrowband selected objects ) that satisfy the following criteria : ( 1 ) @xmath74 , ( 2 ) @xmath75 , and ( 3 ) do not show agn signatures based on optical emission lines or a power - law sed . of these 90 galaxies , 29 are undetected at @xmath17  @xmath1 m to @xmath62  @xmath38 .",
    "we use a larger sample of 158 uv - selected galaxies in the goods - n field that satisfy the three criteria specified above and have corresponding x - ray data that allow us to perform an x - ray stacking analysis (   [ sec : stack ] ) .",
    "finally , the relationship between dustiness and uv spectral slope is investigated with a sample of 392 galaxies ( from 5 of the 6 lbg fields with mips data ) that satisfy the three criteria above and have had their photometry modeled using a stellar population analysis (   [ sec : sedfit ] ) .",
    "to provide a broader context for interpreting the extinction properties , we have derived ages and stellar masses by modeling the broadband photometry of galaxies in our sample . all of the galaxies with mips data have been imaged with irac , enabling us to use the full rest - frame uv through near - ir photometry to fit for their stellar populations .",
    "previous efforts in this regard are described in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . here ,",
    "we update these results using the latest models of charlot & bruzual ( in prep ; cb08 ) that include the @xcite prescription for the thermally - pulsating agb ( tp - agb ) evolution of low- and intermediate - mass stars . the effect of this evolution on the inferred ages and stellar masses",
    "is then determined by comparing with our previous results that employed the @xcite ( bc03 ) models .      for each galaxy",
    ", we considered a constant star - formation ( csf ) model and exponentially - declining star formation histories with characteristic time - scales @xmath76 10 , 20 , 50 , 100 , 200 , 500 , 1000 , 2000 , and 5000 myr .",
    "we further considered a range of ages spaced roughly logarithmically between 1 and 5000 myr , excluding ages older than the age of the universe at the redshift of each galaxy .",
    "in addition , allowed ages were restricted to be longer than the dynamical time - scale of @xmath77  myr , as inferred from velocity dispersion and size measurements of @xmath4 lbgs @xcite . reddening is taken into account by employing the calzetti extinction curve and allowing @xmath78 to range between 0.0@xmath790.6 . in s  [ sec : ebmvyoung ] we also consider the effects of adopting the smc extinction curve on the model results for the youngest galaxies in our sample .",
    "the model sed at each @xmath80 and age combination is reddened , redshifted , and attenuated blueward of rest - frame @xmath81   for the opacity of the igm using the @xcite prescription .",
    "the best - fit normalization of this model is determined by minimizing its @xmath82 with respect to the observed @xmath83+irac ( 3.6@xmath798.0  @xmath1 m ) photometry .",
    "this normalization then determines the star formation rate and stellar mass . the model ( and normalization ) that gives the lowest @xmath82",
    "is taken to be the best - fit sed .",
    "we note the inherent degeneracy in this type of modeling .",
    "typically there are several best - fit models that may adequately describe the observed photometry , even when the redshift is fixed to the spectroscopic value , though there is generally less variation in stellar mass than in the other parameters ( @xmath80 , age , @xmath78 ) among these best - fit models @xcite .    in the subsequent analysis",
    ", we have adopted the best - fit parameters obtained with a csf model for several reasons .",
    "this model generally yields @xmath84 values similar to those obtained when @xmath80 is allowed to vary freely .",
    "additionally , some of the more extreme star formation histories are ruled out because the youngest galaxies in our sample can not realistically have ages much less than the dynamical time - scale of @xmath77  myr .",
    "such extreme models are also unlikely based on the presence of o star and wolf - rayet stellar features in the composite uv spectra of @xmath4 galaxies , irrespective of age ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for simplicity , we do not consider more complex multi - component or stochastic star formation histories as the data would not allow for discrimination between them as compared to simpler star formation histories .",
    "finally , we do not use the sfrs from the sed fitting in the subsequent analysis , opting instead to use the direct tracers examined here , including uv , h@xmath0 , x - ray , and @xmath14  @xmath1 m luminosity .",
    "the parameters of most interest are the age and stellar mass , both of which are determined primarily by the strength of the balmer and 4000   breaks and the stellar continuum flux as traced by the near - ir and irac photometry at @xmath4 .",
    "because the h@xmath0 emission line falls in the @xmath34-band at @xmath85 , it is prudent to determine what effect , if any , the line has on biasing our estimates of the ages and stellar masses .",
    "figure  [ fig : sedcomp ] summarizes the comparison of the best - fit ages and stellar masses ( assuming constant star formation ) obtained with and without correcting for the h@xmath0 contribution to the @xmath34-band flux for 95 galaxies with h@xmath0 measurements .",
    "roughly two - thirds of the sample of 95 galaxies show no change in best - fit age or stellar mass after correcting the @xmath34-band flux for h@xmath0 line contamination , and not surprisingly these galaxies generally have small h@xmath0 equivalent widths ( @xmath86   ) . even for those galaxies with larger h@xmath0 equivalent widths ,",
    "the mean difference in age and stellar mass is relatively small compared to the uncertainty in these parameters as a result of the significant degeneracies inherent in sed fitting .",
    "the small differences in the ages and stellar masses before and after correcting for h@xmath0 emission partly reflect the fact that these parameters are not solely constrained by the near - ir data : 89 of the 95 galaxies also have higher @xmath87 irac data that are unaffected by line contamination at these redshifts .",
    "also note that the age distribution for galaxies with the largest h@xmath0 equivalent widths ( @xmath88   ) , including many of those selected from the narrowband data of the q1700 field (   [ sec : selection ] ) , is not significantly different from that of galaxies with smaller equivalent widths .",
    "the lack of a significant trend between h@xmath0 equivalent width and age for this sample has been noted by @xcite , and may be due to the stochasticity of the instantaneous sfr . in any case , given that the age and sfr distribution of galaxies with h@xmath0 measurements span roughly the entire range probed by uv - selected galaxies in general @xcite , and that the correction for the h@xmath0 flux does not significantly alter the best - fit ages and stellar masses for the majority of the sample , we are confident in our ability to constrain the sed fits of galaxies at @xmath85 even in the absence of direct measurements of the h@xmath0 line contamination in the @xmath34-band .",

    "the tp - agb phase will become important @xmath90  myr after the onset of star formation . anywhere from @xmath91 of galaxies older than this have cb08 derived stellar masses that deviate by more than @xmath92 from their bc03 derived stellar mass , with a median cb08 stellar mass that is a factor of @xmath93 times lower than the bc03 stellar mass .",
    "the cb08 models also imply ages that are on average @xmath94  myr younger than bc03-derived ages .",
    "we will make use of the cb08 derived ages , stellar masses , and color excesses in the subsequent analysis .",
    "the @xmath14  @xmath1 m luminosity , @xmath2 , is computed by _ k_-correcting the @xmath17  @xmath1 m flux using the average mid - ir spectral shape of local starburst galaxies , as discussed in r06 .",
    "all 90 galaxies have _ spectroscopic _ redshifts and therefore are immune to the additional @xmath95  dex uncertainty introduced by photometric redshift errors typical of @xmath4 star - forming galaxies , owing to the complicated mid - ir spectral shape and the redshift - sensitivity of the _ k_-correction ( r06 ) .",
    "h@xmath0 luminosities are corrected for extinction based on the @xmath78 color excess as derived from the sed fitting (   [ sec : sedfit ] ) .",

    "further , the star formation rates derived by correcting the observed uv luminosity for dust using the meurer relation agree well with the star formation rates inferred from the sed - fitting ( left panel of figure  [ fig : compsfr ] ) .",
    "this result is of course not surprising since the calzetti extinction curve ( which is essentially coincident with the meurer relation ) is used in the sed - fitting to estimate reddening and sfrs , both of which are driven primarily by the uv slope .",
    "the practical utility demonstrated here is that the uv - slope can be used to recover the dust attenuation of typical high - redshift star - forming galaxies to within a @xmath49  @xmath38 scatter of @xmath251  dex .",

    "this bias is roughly @xmath253 times larger than the random error in the irx ratio and is generally attributed to the fact that significant amounts of star formation are completely obscured in the uv ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "hence , the reddening deduced from the uv sed tends to be lower than that inferred from more direct tracers of the obscured star formation .",
    "a pertinent question to address is whether our conversion from @xmath17  @xmath1 m flux to infrared luminosity is applicable for such luminous galaxies because , as the reader will recall , our calibration is based primarily on galaxies with @xmath254  l@xmath7 .",
    "an examination of the empirically - derived fits shown in figure  [ fig : l8comp ] illustrates that , with the exception of the bavouzet relation , our estimate of @xmath217 for these luminous objects is similar to what we would have predicted from the other relations .",
    "adopting the bavouzet prediction would lower the irx ratio by @xmath255  dex , an amount which is not enough to account for the mean @xmath49  dex offset of @xmath256  l@xmath7 galaxies from the meurer relation .",
    "further , as we show in   [ sec : bol ] , the relationship between bolometric luminosity and dust attenuation implies that ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) with @xmath257  l@xmath7 on average will have fainter observed uv luminosities , and thus irx ratios that are boosted , relative to lirgs .",
    "consequently , the bias of galaxies with @xmath258  l@xmath7 to have uv slopes that systematically underestimate their attenuation is likely to be a physical effect , as opposed to one driven by luminosity - dependent biases in the calibrations between mid - ir and total ir luminosity .",
    "deviation of the these ultraluminous galaxies from the meurer relation can be seen more clearly in figure  [ fig : bolcomp ] , where we compare the direct tracer of bolometric luminosity ( sum of infrared and uv luminosities ) with that obtained when we combine the uv luminosity with the meurer prediction for the dust attenuation . over the luminosity range probed by the data ,",
    "the meurer relation successfully predicts the bolometric luminosity for lirgs , but significantly underpredicts the luminosity of ulirgs .",
    "this naturally translates to a disagreement between the sed - derived sfrs and those derived from summing the ir and uv - based sfrs for ultraluminous galaxies at these redshifts , since the sed - derived sfrs assume the calzetti extinction curve ( right panel of figure  [ fig : compsfr ] ) .",
    "the critical point is that the meurer relation can be used reliably up to @xmath259  l@xmath7 at @xmath4 , and thus is valid for typical star - forming galaxies at these redshifts .",
    "we now turn to the 49 galaxies with ages @xmath9  myr ; this young sample constitutes @xmath244 of the sample of 392 galaxies .",
    "only 4 of the 49 galaxies are detected directly at @xmath17  @xmath1 m ( figure  [ fig : ebmvyoung ] ) .",
    "about three fourths of the young galaxies undetected at @xmath17  @xmath1 m have limits in irx that imply that they lie below the meurer relation . stacking the @xmath17  @xmath1 m data results in a conservative @xmath35  @xmath38 limit in irx that suggests that these young galaxies are in general less attenuated than their older counterparts at a fixed value of @xmath8 .",
    "this result is further supported by a stack of the x - ray data for the 31 young galaxies in the goods - n field that places a @xmath35  @xmath38 upper limit in irx that is still 0.5  dex lower than the meurer expectation .",
    "these observations suggest that an smc - like ( as opposed to a calzetti ) extinction curve may be more appropriate in describing young galaxies in our sample . because the ages are derived from the stellar population modeling (   [ sec : sedfit ] ) and are therefore degenerate with respect to the assumed extinction curve ( calzetti ) , it seems prudent to determine how the inferred ages are perturbed under the assumption of an smc extinction curve . adopting an smc curve will generally yield older ages relative to the calzetti assumption because in the smc case a smaller fraction of the optical minus near - infrared color is attributed to dust and a larger fraction is attributed to an older stellar population ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the results obtained by adopting an smc curve are summarized in figure  [ fig : ebmvyoung ] .",
    "as expected , the fraction of galaxies considered `` young '' ( @xmath9  myr ) is a factor of 5 times lower ( @xmath260 ) than that obtained with a calzetti curve . more relevant to our discussion here",

    ", these arguments may seem a bit circular given the degeneracy between the assumed extinction law and inferred ages .",
    "however , both irx and @xmath8 are determined _ independently _ of the stellar population modeling and figure  [ fig : ebmvyoung ] demonstrates clearly that irrespective of the choice of extinction curve , the irx-@xmath8 properties of the youngest galaxies deviate from those of older , more typical ones at @xmath4 ( c.f .",

    "the only young galaxies detected directly at @xmath17  @xmath1 m are those with the reddest spectral slopes . because the redshift and uv luminosity distributions of galaxies in the young and typical subsamples are not substantially different ( figure  [ fig : luvdist ] ) , the trend between detection frequency and uv slope implies that the youngest galaxies are less infrared - luminous and less dusty on average than typical galaxies at a fixed @xmath8 .",
    "note further that the distribution of spectral slopes for the older and younger subsamples are unlikely to have been drawn from the same parent distribution .",
    "a k - s test implies a probability @xmath261 that the @xmath8 distribution of young galaxies is drawn from the same parent distribution as that of the older galaxies .",

    "the apparently contradictory results that the young galaxies have both redder spectral slopes _ and _ are on average less dusty than typical galaxies may be understood if the reddening curve of the young galaxies is `` steeper '' ( i.e. , less dust is required to redden the continuum ) in the uv than the typically assumed meurer / calzetti relations , as alluded to above . to rule out any biases that may underlie the offset of these galaxies from the meurer relation",
    ", we must scrutinize the validity of the measures of attenuation for such young galaxies , as we discuss next .",
    "there are several independent reasons to suspect that the @xmath217 we compute for these young galaxies are not biased by the way in which we are measuring them .",
    "we consider first the possibility that galaxies with ages @xmath9  myr have systematically lower @xmath265 ratios than their older counterparts .",
    "specifically , it is thought that much of the carbon dust in the ism is ejected from agb stars on timescales of @xmath90  myr , whereas the larger dust grains responsible for the bulk of the ir emission are produced on the much shorter timescale of type ii supernovae .",
    "local observations appear to support this scenario in the sense that pah metallicity ( z@xmath266 ) is observed to be significantly lower relative to the ir dust grain metallicity ( z@xmath267 ) for metal poor galaxies , but that the ratio of the metallicities increases rapidly until an equilibrium is reached for gas phase metallicities ( z@xmath268 ) in excess of @xmath100  z@xmath7 , owing to increased carbon ejection by agbs @xcite .",
    "this delayed injection of carbon grains results in a depressed ratio of mid - ir to total - ir flux for galaxies younger than @xmath269  myr . however , direct measurements of the mid - ir spectral features from _ spitzer _ irs spectra and long wavelength ( @xmath270  @xmath1 m ) constraints on the infrared luminosities of two young ( @xmath271  myr ) lensed lbgs at @xmath98 ( ms1512@xmath79cb58 and the `` cosmic eye '' ) imply @xmath265 ratios that are similar to those of local star - forming galaxies and high - redshift submillimeter galaxies @xcite , and older lbgs at @xmath272 @xcite .",
    "in addition , an independent deduction based on co observations of ms1512@xmath79cb58 @xcite points to an @xmath217 that is not significantly different than what we would have predicted from our calibration between @xmath2 and @xmath217 . further , if we restrict the local correlation between z@xmath273 , z@xmath267 , and z@xmath268 to the same dynamic range in gas - phase metallicity as observed among lbgs at @xmath4 , @xmath274",
    "z@xmath275 z@xmath7 @xcite , we would find a pah to dust grain metallicity ratio that is roughly constant .",
    "the limited dynamic range in gas - phase metallicity probed by the current sample , as well as the direct measurements of the pah to ir ratio in lensed lbgs at @xmath276 , suggests that our conversion between @xmath2 and @xmath217 ( calibrated primarily on galaxies older than @xmath94  myr ) should be a reasonable approximation for the younger galaxies as well . in this case , the mid - ir emission observed in the young galaxies may be due to some combination of silicate and amorphous carbon dust produced in type ii supernovae @xcite .",
    "finally , the x - ray data provide an independent confirmation of our results .",
    "the x - ray emission in starburst galaxies arises primarily from shock - heated outflowing gas @xcite and high - mass x - ray binaries @xcite , both of which should be sensitive to star formation on relatively short timescales ( @xmath77  myr ) that are comparable to the dynamical timescale noted above .",
    "consequently , if the true infrared luminosities of the young galaxies were larger than what we infer from @xmath2 ( and if @xmath217 was consistent with the meurer prediction ) , then the x - ray stack of the 49 young galaxies should have yielded a significant detection .",
    "yet , we are able to place a firm @xmath35  @xmath38 upper limit on the the x - ray - inferred irx of @xmath277 .    in summary , galaxies with ages @xmath9  myr appear to have lower attenuation on average than their uv slopes would imply from the meurer relation ( note that the meurer and calzetti relations track each other closely for @xmath278 ) .",

    "similar conclusions are reached by r06 and @xcite .",
    "we have shown here that this result appears to apply generically to most young @xmath9  myr galaxies at @xmath4 .",
    "the small fraction of young galaxies that have red @xmath8 and are detected at @xmath17  @xmath1 m points to a scatter in irx for young galaxies that may be larger than for their older counterparts .",
    "( `` westphal - mm8 '' ) results in a bolometric luminosity similar to that inferred from its detection at @xmath280  @xmath1 m @xcite . ] direct detection of the dust emission of a statistical sample of young high - redshift galaxies is required to accurately constrain their scatter in attenuation .",
    "we conclude by noting the following .",
    "first , only 10 of the 90 galaxies used to constrain the relation between @xmath2 and @xmath54 have ( calzetti - derived ) ages @xmath281  myr , and redetermining the relation excluding these 10 sources does little to affect the overall fit between @xmath2 and @xmath54 . in other words ,",
    "our assumption of the calzetti relation in dust correcting the @xmath282 luminosities for these sources minimally affects our conversion between @xmath2 and @xmath217 .",
    "second , when computing bolometric sfrs , the overestimation of attenuation by applying the meurer / calzetti relations may be partly compensated for by the fact that the uv luminosities in young galaxies will _ underpredict _ the star formation rate .",
    "the latter effect is due to the fact that for a constant star formation history the ratio of o and b stars contributing to the uv continuum will stabilize only after the main sequence lifetime of b stars of @xmath283  myr .",
    "this underscores the need to correct for both a different attenuation and a different conversion between uv luminosity and sfr when inferring the total star formation rates of young galaxies ( ages @xmath9  myr ) at high redshift .",
    "we have used the relationship between @xmath2 , sfr , and @xmath217 to examine the variation of uv slope with dust attenuation for typical galaxies , bolometrically - luminous ones , and the youngest galaxies at @xmath4 .",
    "we find a significant correlation between uv slope and attenuation for the vast majority of typical star - forming galaxies at @xmath4 . in this case",
    ", the uv slope can be used to recover dust attenuation to within a scatter of 0.4  dex . those galaxies with bolometric luminosities in excess of @xmath228  l@xmath7 have dust obscurations that exceed by almost a decade those predicted from the uv slope , owing to the larger fraction of obscured luminosity in these galaxies and , as we show in   [ sec : bol ] , a decrease in observed uv luminosity relative to galaxies with moderate bolometric luminosities .",
    "finally , for the @xmath284 of our sample ( exact fraction depends on the extinction law used to model the galaxies photometry ; see discussion above ) that consists of young galaxies with ages @xmath285  myr , the local correlation overpredicts dust attenuations at a given @xmath8 .",
    "this implies that such young galaxies may on average follow an extinction curve that deviates from the usually assumed meurer / calzetti .",
    "these results are similar to what we found previously based on a smaller sample of galaxies in the goods - north field ( r06 ) . here",
    ", we have expanded these initial results by exploring in more detail some of the systematics that may give rise to such an offset .",
    "we find that the undetected young galaxies and the two lensed lbgs from the literature exhibit @xmath8 and irx that are consistent with an smc dust extinction curve ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this behavior may be due to a difference in covering fraction of dust , where the younger galaxies have larger covering fractions consistent with a foreground screen of dust as described by an smc - like extinction curve .",
    "alternatively , we can not rule out the possibility that the dissimilar extinction curve for young galaxies may arise from differences in the dust grain size distribution",
    ". this may be the case if the dust giving rise to the mid - ir emission in young galaxies is produced primarily in type ii sne and contrasts in size and composition from dust produced in lower mass stars ( e.g. , @xcite ; see also discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "employing our measures of the dust obscuration and bolometric luminosities for typical star - forming galaxies at @xmath286 , we proceed to examine the relationship between these two quantities , its implication for the correlation between uv and bolometric luminosity , and its redshift evolution .      based on the sample of 392 galaxies with mips observations , we find a strong correlation between @xmath10 and dust attenuation with a formal scatter of 0.23 dex about a linear fit ( figure  [ fig : bolfig ] ) .",
    "the fit to the present data is essentially identical to the linear fit to a smaller sample in the goods - n field ( r06 ) , despite the differences in the conversion between @xmath2 and @xmath217 used in the current versus previous ( r06 ) study .",
    "this similarity ( and the small scatter ) is due to the fact that @xmath287 is highly correlated with dust attenuation , @xmath288 , according to our definitions .",
    "nonetheless , we are confident of our calibration between bolometric luminosity and dust attenuation given that @xmath10 estimated from the sum of the ir and uv luminosities is consistent with @xmath10 ( or sfr ) estimated from x - ray data and from the dust - corrected h@xmath0 and uv luminosities (   [ sec : stack ] ) .",
    "further , r06 showed that the relationship between @xmath10 and @xmath288 for uv - selected samples remains valid for star - forming galaxies selected on their rest - frame optical colors and/or submillimeter emission .",

    "the relationship between @xmath10 and @xmath11 implies that galaxies with faint uv luminosities are less attenuated than their uv - bright counterparts . a recent study based on deep goods and udf acs finds that uv - faint galaxies at @xmath296 have systematically bluer uv slopes ( @xmath8 ) relative to uv - bright ones , implying that the former may be less dusty @xcite .",
    "further , @xcite and @xcite argue based on physical reasons that such uv - faint galaxies are unlikely to be as attenuated on average as their uv - bright counterparts .",
    "for example , significant amounts of dust in these galaxies , combined with their large number densities as inferred from the steep faint - end slope of the uv lf , would result in stellar mass densities and an infrared background significantly in excess of those measured @xcite .",
    "taking this luminosity - dependent dust correction into account , @xcite and @xcite demonstrate that such uv faint galaxies dominate the bolometric luminosity density at @xmath272 .",
    "our present ( larger ) data set suggests a significant dependence between bolometric and uv luminosity , as evidenced by the trend between @xmath17  @xmath1 m nondetection fraction and uv luminosity ( figure  [ fig : luvundet ] ) .",
    "specifically , this trend implies that galaxies with faint @xmath11 are also on average less ir - luminous , in turn suggesting that they are less bolometrically - luminous , than their uv - bright counterparts .",
    "the trend between @xmath17  @xmath1 m nondetection fraction and @xmath11 is further supported by a stacking analysis . specifically , we stacked the @xmath17  @xmath1 m data in bins of @xmath11 , including both detections and nondetections , and limited the stack to galaxies with @xmath297  l@xmath7 .",
    "the latter restriction is imposed because we are interested in determining whether a trend exists between dustiness and uv luminosity for _ typical _ galaxies at @xmath4 ( i.e. , excluding bolometrically - luminous galaxies with values of @xmath11 similar to those of galaxies with lower @xmath10 ) .",
    "these stacked results yield average @xmath10 consistent with the prediction from combining the meurer relation with the trend between uv slope and continuum magnitude ( e.g. , @xcite ) , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : bolvuv ] .",
    "thus , our present sample provides the first direct evidence ( independent of the uv slope ) for a trend between uv luminosity on the one hand , and bolometric luminosity and dust obscuration on the other .    at first glance",
    ", these results run counter to our previous analysis that indicated no correlation between dustiness and uv magnitude for uv - bright ( @xmath298 ) galaxies @xcite .",
    "more specifically , in the previous analysis of the goods - north field , the stacked values of @xmath288 as a function of uv magnitude had uncertainties that were sufficiently large that we could not rule out the possibility of no trend between dustiness and uv - magnitude ( see figure  11 of @xcite ; see also discussion in   [ sec : irxprev ] ) .",
    "note that despite this lack of trend observed with the smaller sample , we investigated in detail the systematics introduced by assuming various relations between dustiness and uv luminosity extending from uv - bright galaxies ( for which empircal constraints on the dust obscuration factors exist ) to uv - faint galaxies ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the variation of ir and bolometric luminosity with uv luminosity becomes more apparent with our larger sample ( figures  [ fig : bolvuv],[fig : luvundet ] ,   [ sec : irxprev ] ) .",
    "the shallower - than - unity slope of the relationship between @xmath10 and dust obscuration implies that the uv luminosity turns over or `` saturates , '' at which point any additional star formation will be optically - thick ( figure  [ fig : bolvuv ] ) . as we discuss below , this saturation of the uv luminosity with increasing sfr likely explains why no correlation was found previously between @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( e.g. , as can also be seen by the scatter of the points in figure  [ fig : bolvuv ] ) since these spectroscopic samples probe a relatively narrow range of uv luminosity around the value of @xmath18 .",
    "the saturation point can only be ascertained from the functional fit to the @xmath10-@xmath288 relation and should become more apparent with future measurements of the dust attenuation of galaxies fainter than our spectroscopic limit . in any case , galaxies routinely found in _ spitzer",
    "_ surveys at high redshift ( e.g. , ulirgs ) are typically fainter in the uv than moderately luminous galaxies found in optical surveys ( e.g. , lirgs ) .",
    "as noted above , such ulirgs appear to follow the same @xmath10-dustiness relation as uv - selected galaxies .",
    "these results can be understood if the dust obscuration , @xmath288 , increases more rapidly than the increase of _ total _ uv luminosity as the bolometric luminosity increases .",
    "this may largely explain why ulirgs have irx ratios far in excess of the values predicted by their uv spectral slopes based on the meurer relation (   [ sec : meurer ] , figure  [ fig : bolcomp ] ) .",
    "the turnover in @xmath11 implies that even in the presence of galaxies with very large sfrs at @xmath4 , the observed uv luminosity will never be brighter than a certain value which , at @xmath4 , corresponds to @xmath299  l@xmath7 .",
    "the connection between uv and bolometric luminosity has important implications for the shape of the uv luminosity function .",
    "in particular , the saturation point for the observed uv luminosity occurs approximately at the values of @xmath18 and @xmath300 at @xmath4 .",
    "this is not surprising because , by definition , @xmath12 is the point brighter than which the number density of sources decreases exponentially .",
    "this effect can also be seen by comparing our previous determinations of the uv lf , which is well - described by a schechter function , with the bolometric lf , which has a more power - law like shape and not as well defined of a `` knee '' @xcite .",
    "the important point is that the saturation effect is a direct result of the increasing extinction with @xmath10 .",
    "consequently , dust obscuration must be the dominant effect in modulating the bright - end of the uv lf , and thus dictating the value of @xmath12 , at @xmath4 .",
    "comparison with the relation derived locally ( e.g. , @xcite ) shows that @xmath12 galaxies at @xmath4 exhibit @xmath288 ratios that are a factor of 5 times lower than those of local galaxies with a similar @xmath10 @xcite , implying a redshift evolution in the extinction per unit star formation rate ( or per unit @xmath10 ) .",
    "r06 suggested that this may reflect either an evolution in the dust - to - gas ratios as galaxies age or a change in the average sizes of the infrared and uv emitting regions of galaxies with redshift . in the following",
    ", we discuss the importance of the @xmath11 limit in accurately assessing this evolution , a consideration of the @xmath10-@xmath288 relation for uv - faint galaxies at high redshift , and the implications of these results for the evolution of individual galaxies .",
    "quantifying properly the evolution in the @xmath10-@xmath288 relation requires a careful consideration of the @xmath11 limit used to compare samples at different redshifts ( see also the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "the strong redshift evolution in @xmath301 @xcite implies that a relatively shallow uv luminosity limit will exclude the parameter space in the @xmath10-@xmath288 plane where most normal galaxies in the local universe lie ( figure  [ fig : luvbol ] ) , causing one to infer a milder redshift evolution in the extinction per unit sfr .",
    "it is clear that an accurate comparison of these relations for typical galaxies requires a @xmath11 limit that is sufficiently faint to detect these average ( @xmath18 ) galaxies at all redshifts in question .",
    "a sufficiently faint @xmath11 limit reveals that @xmath18 galaxies at @xmath4 are a factor of @xmath63 times less attenuated than local galaxies of the same @xmath10 ( figure  [ fig : luvbol ] ) .",
    "clearly the @xmath11 limit is also an important consideration in our interpretation of the @xmath10-@xmath288 relation at @xmath4 .",
    "this limit is defined by the magnitude cut of our spectroscopic sample ( @xmath302 ) and corresponds to @xmath303  l@xmath7 ( figures  [ fig : luvdist ] , [ fig : luvbol ] ) .",
    "this limit is faint enough to detect @xmath18 galaxies at @xmath4 , where @xmath18 is determined not from the present sample alone , but from a consideration of the uv luminosity function measured using data extending @xmath304  mag fainter than our spectroscopic limit @xcite .",
    "therefore , the @xmath10-@xmath288 relation derived here is not just valid for the sample analyzed here , but valid for @xmath305 galaxies in general .",
    "the saturation of @xmath11 discussed above can also be seen in figures  [ fig : luvbol ] and [ fig : luvbol3 ] where the relation between @xmath10 and @xmath288 at @xmath4 crosses the same line of constant @xmath11 more than once .",
    "let us now consider how the @xmath10-@xmath288 relation may change for galaxies fainter than the @xmath303  l@xmath7 threshold .",
    "our finding of lower bolometric luminosities for uv - faint galaxies (   [ sec : bolvuv ] ) suggests that extending the @xmath303  l@xmath7 limit to fainter luminosities is unlikely to reveal a very large population of uv - faint galaxies with @xmath10 similar to those of uv - bright ones .",
    "therefore the @xmath10-@xmath288 relation is unlikely to be significantly broader at @xmath306  l@xmath7 than what we have measured from the spectroscopic sample .",
    "we have illustrated this point by using the relation between uv luminosity and @xmath8 @xcite to infer the dust attenuation and bolometric luminosities using the meurer relation , thus extending our measurement of the @xmath10-@xmath288 relation to uv - faint galaxies ( figure  [ fig : luvbol ] ) .",
    "examined over a wider range in uv luminosity , it becomes clear that the @xmath10-@xmath288 relation at @xmath4 is defined by a sequence of galaxies with increasing @xmath10 and @xmath288 with increasing uv luminosity .",
    "figure  [ fig : luvbol3 ] highlights another important issue . while the dustiness of galaxies of a given @xmath10 increases with decreasing redshift , this should not be miscontrued to suggest that a typical @xmath4 galaxy will evolve to become dustier but retain the same @xmath10 .",
    "clustering analyses of @xmath12 galaxies at @xmath4 imply that they evolve to reside in the bulges of spirals and low mass ellipticals by @xmath307 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the evolutionary track of any _ single _ galaxy in the @xmath10-@xmath288 plane is unlikely to be perpendicular to either axis . as",
    "galaxies on average fade between @xmath4 and the present day , reflecting the global decline of the star formation rate density ( e.g. , @xcite ) , there will be a corresponding decrease in their @xmath11 and @xmath217 , and hence @xmath10 .",
    "the critical point is that without taking into account the offset between the @xmath4 and @xmath307 relations , one would wrongly conclude that the dustiness observed in local @xmath300 galaxies is similar to that observed for galaxies of the same bolometric luminosity at @xmath4 , when in fact the dustiness is lower at a fixed @xmath10 at higher redshift .",
    "the correlation between bolometric luminosity and dust attenuation simply reflects the relationship between star formation rate and gas surface density , i.e. , the schmidt law @xcite .",
    "an increase in the dust - to - gas ratio with galaxy age would simply shift this relationship with redshift , as is observed @xcite . in   [ sec : metals ] we revisit the variation of bolometric luminosity with dust attenuation in the context of the oxygen abundances of starburst galaxies .",
    "geometrical effects are also likely to play an important role in the offset between the @xmath4 and @xmath307 relations . for instance , in figure  [ fig : luvbol3 ] , many of the @xmath307 galaxies with @xmath308  l@xmath229 are bulge - dominated spirals with star formation extending on scales of several tens of kpc . if most of the star formation occurs in the more metal - poor parts of the galactic disks @xcite , then the measured @xmath288 ratios would be significantly lower than what we would infer based on the globally - averaged dust - to - gas ratio , including the metal - rich component associated with the bulge .",
    "the conclusion from the above observations is that some combination of dust - to - gas ratio and size evolution will drive the observed progression of the @xmath10-@xmath288 relation with redshift .",
    "a consequence of this evolution is that we expect to see an offset in the metallicity - luminosity relation with redshift , which we discuss in ",
    "[ sec : metals ] . in practice , this redshift evolution in the extinction per unit sfr implies that rest - uv selection allows one to access galaxies with an increasingly larger range in @xmath10 with increasing redshift .",
    "the increasing uv transparency with redshift was noted by @xcite for uv - selected samples and shown to be true for galaxies selected using other rest - optical and submm flux criteria as discussed in @xcite .",
    "@xcite also discuss this issue in the context of the differences between local and high - redshift ulirgs .",
    "the increasing dynamic range in bolometric luminosity probed by uv selection is demonstrated more directly in figure  [ fig : iuecomp ] where we compare typical galaxies at @xmath13 , for which the meurer relation is found to be valid , with many of the same galaxies that were used to calibrate the @xcite relation locally ; the latter sample is drawn from observations with the _ international ultraviolet explorer _ ( _ iue _ ; @xcite ) .",
    "galaxies that were used to calibrate the meurer relation locally span the same range of irx ( @xmath288 ) as @xmath12 galaxies at @xmath4 , yet the local sample spans luminosities that are anywhere from one to two decades less luminous at a fixed @xmath288 .",
    "the meurer relation appears to hold for typical galaxies at @xmath4 despite the fact that the relation was calibrated on local galaxies that were significantly less luminous .",
    "this suggests that the uv sed alone can be used to recover the total dust attenuation in galaxies with progressively larger @xmath10 at higher redshift , given that , at higher redshift , galaxies are more transparent in the uv at a fixed @xmath10 ( figures  [ fig : bolcomp ] , [ fig : iuecomp ] ) .",
    "the contours of fixed @xmath11 and @xmath217 shown in figure  [ fig : luvbol3 ] emphasize the relative change in these quantities as the dustiness is varied at a fixed @xmath10 at @xmath4 . at @xmath309  @xmath310 , stochastic changes in the dust obscuration ( e.g. , such as might be expected if the extinction is patchy ) results in @xmath11 to vary much more than @xmath217 , simply because a larger fraction of the total luminosity is obscured ( e.g. , see also @xcite ) . for faint galaxies with",
    "@xmath311  l@xmath7 , an adjustment in the dust attenuation will do little to alter the uv luminosity while @xmath217 changes more dramatically .",
    "of course , none of these observations are particularly surprising , given that as we adjust @xmath11 there must be a corresponding change in @xmath217 to keep @xmath10 constant .",
    "several times throughout the discussion above we have mentioned the correlation between uv luminosity on the one hand , and bolometric luminosity and dust attenuation on the other . at face value , these results contrast with previous investigations that have found no correlation between uv luminosity and dustiness @xcite , as discussed briefly in   [ sec : bolfaint ] .",
    "of course , a constant average dust correction with uv luminosity naturally leads to lower bolometric luminosities with decreasing uv luminosity .",
    "it is clear , however , that if uv - faint galaxies are significantly bluer than their brighter counterparts @xcite , and their bolometric luminosities are consistent with the meurer prediction ( stacked points in figure  [ fig : bolvuv ] ) , then their average dust obscuration must also be lower ( dashed line in figure  [ fig : luvbol ] ) . hence , their bolometric luminosities will be correspondingly lower . we find direct evidence of this from the trend between @xmath17  @xmath1 m detection fraction and uv luminosity ( figure  [ fig : luvundet ] ) , even for the present sample which is larger but covers the same dynamic range in @xmath11 as previous studies @xcite .",
    "the trend between uv luminosity and uv slope was found over a slightly larger dynamic range in @xmath11 than is usually represented in spectroscopic samples @xcite .",
    "the limited dynamic range and/or smaller samples may have contributed to the apparent lack of correlation between uv luminosity and dustiness observed before .",
    "there are a couple of other reasons why such a correlation may have been difficult to discern in previous studies .",
    "the first is that the saturation of @xmath11 occurs at a value that lies in the range of @xmath11 that is typically probed in spectroscopic surveys . in other words ,",
    "the non - monotonic behavior of @xmath11 with bolometric luminosity for @xmath312  l@xmath229 , folded in with measurement errors , washes out the underlying trend between @xmath11 and @xmath10 .",
    "the trend between dustiness and uv luminosity becomes more apparent once galaxies above the saturation point are removed from the analysis (   [ sec : bolfaint ] ) .",
    "second , as seen in the previous section , the lack of correlation may be due to the strong variance of @xmath11 with stochastic changes in the dust obscuration for galaxies of moderate ( or higher ) luminosities ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is clear that with larger samples , superior ( direct ) tracers of dust emission , and a larger dynamic range , one can obtain a more complete picture of how dust obscuration varies with other galaxy properties .      in this section",
    "we have considered the functional form of the correlation between bolometric luminosity and dust obscuration , its consequence for the shape of the uv luminosity function at @xmath4 , and its redshift evolution . for galaxies brighter than our spectroscopic limit of @xmath303  l@xmath7 , we find a tight positive correlation between bolometric luminosity and dust obscuration ( @xmath10-@xmath288 ) .",
    "our sample provides the first direct evidence for the decrease of infrared luminosity with decreasing uv luminosity .",
    "our results suggest that dust obscuration is likely the dominant effect in modulating the bright - end of the uv lf as evidenced by the saturation of uv luminosity with increasing star formation rate .",
    "we demonstrate the importance of the @xmath11 limit in quantifying the redshift evolution of the @xmath10-@xmath288 relation . using a sufficiently faint limit",
    ", we find that @xmath12 galaxies at @xmath4 have dust obscuration ratios ( @xmath288 ) that are roughly a factor of @xmath313 times lower than those of local galaxies of the same bolometric luminosity .",
    "we examine this offset in the context of metallicity in the next section .",
    "it is clear from the discussion above that an increase in the dust - to - gas ratios with age plays an important role in the observed evolution of the correlation between bolometric luminosity and dust attenuation .",
    "more generally , because most of the metals in the ism will be contained in ( or depleted onto ) the same dust grains that attenuate starlight , we expect that the dust attenuation should correlate directly with metallicity and hence stellar mass .",

    "this offset likely reflects the larger gas fractions at a given stellar mass with increasing redshift ( see discussion in @xcite ) .      to test our expectation of a correlation between metallicity and dust attenuation ,",
    "we have investigated the variation of @xmath288 with stellar mass for the sample of 392 galaxies ( figure  [ fig : metals ] ) .",
    "assuming that the @xmath17  @xmath1 m undetected galaxies have a similar scatter in @xmath288 at a given mass as the @xmath17  @xmath1 m detected galaxies , we find a scatter between attenuation and stellar mass of @xmath314  dex about a linear fit between the two .",
    "the trend between attenuation and mass can be visualized more easily by examining the mean attenuation in bins of stellar mass as inferred from a stacking analysis . to compute the average @xmath288",

    ", we find that galaxies with stellar masses @xmath315  m@xmath7 are roughly 100 times more attenuated on average than those with stellar masses @xmath316  m@xmath7 . because the gas - phase metallicity also appears to be significantly correlated with stellar mass ( and in the same direction as that observed for the mass - attenuation relation )",
    ", it suggests a close connection between dust attenuation and gas - phase metallicity , in accord with expectations . relating the mean obscuration in a given bin of stellar mass with",
    "the metallicity expected for that stellar mass from the mass - metallicity relation , we obtain the following empirical relation between obscuration and gas - phase metallicity as measured via the oxygen abundance : @xmath317 the upper limit to which the calibration is valid ( @xmath318 ) corresponds to the point at which [ nii]/h@xmath0 begins to saturate for galaxies with close to solar metallicity ( see next section ) .",
    "this conversion allows one to estimate to within @xmath319  dex random scatter the gas - phase metallicity expected for a given dust attenuation for @xmath12 galaxies at @xmath4 .",
    "this scatter includes both the scatter in the mass - metallicity relation @xcite and that in the relation between the [ nii]/h@xmath0 ratio and oxygen abundance",
    ". this relation can be useful in practice because measuring the dust obscuration for large numbers of individual galaxies is observationally more feasible than measuring gas - phase metallicities ; the latter requires near - ir spectroscopy at these redshifts .",
    "nonetheless , we caution against the use of this relation for dust obscurations that are dissimilar to the ones used in the calibration , given the very limited dynamic range in metallicity probed by the current sample .",
    "figure  [ fig : metals ] shows the comparison between dust attenuation , stellar mass , and metallicity .",
    "recall that eq .",
    "[ eq : attmet ] is derived from the average attenuation and metallicity of galaxies with a given stellar mass .",
    "to better gauge how well this relationship holds for individual galaxies , we examined sources in our sample that also have published individual metallicity determinations ( see table  9 of @xcite ) . to remove any potential systematics between metallicity calibrations",
    ", we considered only galaxies where oxygen abudances were inferred from the n2 index @xcite .",
    "while there were only 10 galaxies in our sample that met these requirements , their dust attenuations and metallicities are consistent with our conversion between the two within the measurement errors ( @xmath320  dex scatter between the individual measurements and the relationship determined from stacking ; figure  [ fig : metals ] ) .",
    "obviously , larger samples of galaxies with individual metallicity measurements , such as those made possible with multi - object near - ir spectrographs ( e.g. , mosfire ; @xcite ) , will enable more detailed investigations of the connection between dust attenuation and gas - phase metallicity .",
    "we can gain a broader perspective on the @xmath4 results by comparing them to the local trend between metallicity and dust obscuration , where locally the galaxy metallicities are more robustly measured using a variety of calibrations and observations cover a larger dynamic range in metallicity .",
    "@xcite find strong positive trends of oxygen abundance ( o / h ) with @xmath288 and @xmath8 for a sample of local starburst galaxies ( figure  [ fig : metloc ] ) .",
    "they interpret these trends as a reflection of the increasing extinction of uv emission ( and reddening of the uv slope ) as the dust - to - gas ratio increases with gas - phase metallicity .    before comparing with the @xmath4 results , we must first account for the systematic differences in the way that oxygen abundances are inferred locally versus at high redshift @xcite . as discussed above , the abundances for the @xmath4 sample",
    "are derived based on the calibration of [ nii]/h@xmath0 with o / h @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the abundances tabulated in @xcite are based primarily on either direct temperature - sensitive ( @xmath321 ) methods or the r23 calibration . for a robust comparison with the @xmath4 sample",
    ", we searched the literature to find [ nii]/h@xmath0 measurements for all of the @xcite galaxies .",
    "the comparison between the metallicities tabulated in @xcite and those derived from the n2 index is shown in figure  [ fig : metloc ] .",
    "the two sets of metallicity measurements agree well up to solar metallicity , at which point the [ nii]/h@xmath0 indicator saturates due to nitrogen becoming the dominant coolant , an effect that has been noted elsewhere @xcite .    having remeasured the metallicities for the local sample using the same abundance indicator adopted at high redshift , we find that the variations in o / h with @xmath8 and irx for @xmath12 galaxies at @xmath4 are in general agreement with the local relations ( figure  [ fig : metloc ] ) .",
    "the implication of this agreement is that for a fixed metallicity , the @xmath4 and @xmath307 galaxies have similar dust - to - gas ratios , despite the fact that the high - redshift ones are @xmath322 times more bolometrically luminous .",
    "it is here that we see another manifestation of the redshift evolution of the correlation between bolometric luminosity and dustiness . as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : bol ] , @xmath4 galaxies are significantly more luminous at a fixed dust obscuration than local galaxies .",
    "we see a similar effect in the context of metallicity , in the sense that galaxies with a fixed metallicity ( or dust - to - gas ratio ) are significantly more luminous at high redshift .",
    "this result is a natural expectation given the positive correlation between dust attenuation and metallicity ( figure  [ fig : metloc ] ) .",
    "the progression of metallicity with increasing obscuration ( figures  [ fig : metals ] ) and the strong correlation between bolometric luminosity and dust attenuation (   [ sec : bol ] ) imply the existence of a luminosity - metallicity relation at @xmath4 ( e.g. , see also @xcite ) .",
    "further , the similarity in dust - to - gas ratio and difference in luminosity suggests a significant redshift evolution in the optical luminosity - metallicity relation , as has been noted by @xcite in the context of @xmath4 galaxies , and noted elsewhere for samples primarily at lower redshift ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "quantitatively , a lirg with @xmath323  l@xmath7 at @xmath4 is on average a third less metal - enriched than a galaxy with the same ( lirg ) bolometric luminosity locally .",
    "similarly , the results suggest that high - redshift galaxies are scaled up versions of local starbursts where , for a fixed metallicity , the high - redshift ones are significantly more luminous than the local ones .    these observations can be understood if high - redshift galaxies are on average less - evolved than local galaxies , where the high - redshift ones have larger gas fractions and are forming stars in a less metal - rich environment ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the redshift evolution of both the luminosity - metallicity and the luminosity - obscuration relations is then largely reflective of the underlying chemical evolution of galaxies as they age .",
    "as we have seen (   [ sec : bol ] ) , this evolution has important implications for the relative transparency ( or `` optical - depth '' ) of galaxies and their amenability to uv - selection at ever - increasing redshifts .",
    "we use ground - based uv imaging , near - ir spectroscopy , and _ spitzer _",
    "mips @xmath17  @xmath1 m imaging of a large sample of lyman break galaxies to investigate how the 8  @xmath1 m luminosity ( @xmath2 ) is related to the h@xmath0 luminosity ( @xmath54 ) , infrared luminosity ( @xmath217 ) , and star formation rate of @xmath12 galaxies at @xmath4 .",
    "_ chandra _ x - ray data are used to provide an independent check of the average star formation rates derived in this manner .",
    "we then use the derived relationships to estimate the bolometric luminosities ( @xmath10 ) and dust attenuation of typical galaxies at @xmath4 .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows :    \\1 . using a sample of 90 lyman break galaxies with h@xmath0 spectroscopic and narrowband observations and mips @xmath17  @xmath1 m imaging , we find a tight correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath54 with 0.24 dex scatter .",
    "we combine this result with the kennicutt relations , taking care to account for the unobscured component of the star formation rate , to derive relations between @xmath2 and @xmath217/sfr .",
    "\\2 . based on a larger sample of 392 galaxies with mips observations , we find that the rest - frame uv slopes ( @xmath8 ) of typical star - forming galaxies at @xmath4 with ages @xmath324  myr correlate significantly with dust attenuation , parameterized by the ratio of infrared - to - uv luminosity , @xmath288 .",
    "galaxies with flatter ( bluer ) @xmath8 are less dusty on average than those with redder @xmath8 .",
    "further , the correlation between @xmath8 and dust attenuation is indistinguishable from that established for local uv - starburst galaxies @xcite , the latter of which is almost always used to infer the dust attenuation of uv - selected galaxies at high redshift .",
    "we demonstrate here that the local correlation can be used to infer the extinction and bolometric luminosities of @xmath6  l@xmath7 galaxies at @xmath4 to within a scatter of @xmath325  dex .",
    "galaxies with the largest bolometric luminosities of @xmath326  l@xmath7 have bluer @xmath8 than their dust attenuations would imply based on the local correlation , or the correlation for the vast majority of star - forming galaxies at @xmath4 .",
    "this effect is likely due to the fact the majority of the star formation in these bolometrically luminous and heavily attenuated galaxies is optically - thick at uv wavelengths ( see also point 5 below ) .    \\3 .",
    "separately , @xmath284 of our @xmath4 sample consists of young galaxies with inferred ages of @xmath9  myr . unlike their older and more typical counterparts , these young galaxies are significantly less attenuated at a given @xmath8 , as evidenced by their larger non - detection rate at @xmath17  @xmath1 m and their non - detections in the stacked @xmath17  @xmath1 m and x - ray images .",
    "these observations suggest that young galaxies may follow an extinction curve that is different than the usually assumed meurer / calzetti ; the data for the young galaxies are consistent with an smc - like extinction curve",
    ". if this is the case , then their dust obscuration may be up to a factor of 2 - 3 lower than the values obtained by assuming the local correlation between @xmath8 and dust attenuation .",
    "we verify our previous result that galaxies with larger bolometric luminosities are more heavily attenuated by dust , and galaxies with redder @xmath8 are also more bolometrically luminous on average than those with bluer @xmath8 .",
    "comparison with the local correlation between @xmath10 and dust attenuation implies that @xmath12 galaxies at @xmath4 with @xmath327  l@xmath7 are an order of magnitude less dusty than local galaxies with a similar @xmath10 .",
    "such an effect may be related to an increase of dust - to - gas ratio as galaxies age .",
    "the redshift evolution in the extinction per unit sfr implies that in practice uv selection gives access to galaxies with an increasingly larger range in @xmath10 at increasing redshift .",
    "it also implies that the uv sed alone can be used to recover the total dust attenuation in galaxies with progressively larger @xmath10 at higher redshift , given that , at higher redshift , galaxies are more transparent in the uv at a fixed @xmath10 .",
    "we recast the correlation between bolometric luminosity and dust attenuation at @xmath4 in terms of observed uv luminosity to come to the following conclusions .",
    "first , galaxies with faint uv luminosities are expected to be less attenuated than their uv - bright counterparts .",
    "this result is supported by our data that indicate that uv - faint galaxies are less ir luminous ( and less bolometrically luminous ) than uv - bright ones .",
    "second , we observe that galaxies with very large star formation rates ( e.g. , ulirgs ) are less uv luminous per unit sfr than galaxies with lower sfrs ( e.g. , lirgs ) , implying that the dust covering fraction is likely increasing more rapidly with sfr than the intrinsic uv luminosity .",
    "this effect results in a saturation of the uv luminosity .",
    "this saturation occurs at the value of @xmath12 at these redshifts , implying that the bright - end of the uv lf at @xmath13 is likely modulated by dust obscuration .",
    "\\6 . motivated by the expectation of a direct correspondence between extinction and metallicity",
    ", we have examined the relationship between dust attenuation and stellar mass .",
    "galaxies with stellar mass @xmath328  m@xmath7 are almost 100 times more dusty on average than those with masses @xmath316  m@xmath7 .",
    "the monotonically increasing mass - attenuation and mass - metallicity relations imply a close connection between attenuation and metallicity , allowing us to provide an empirical calibration between the two .",
    "this calibration is verified with a small sample of @xmath4 galaxies with individual metallicity determinations .",
    "comparison with the local relationship between metal abundance and dust obscuration suggests that @xmath12 galaxies at @xmath4 have a similar ratio of dust - to - metals as local starbursts , despite the high - redshift galaxies bolometric luminosities being a factor of 10 to 20 times larger than local galaxies .",
    "our results imply a redshift evolution in the luminosity - metallicity and luminosity - obscuration relations that reflects the underlying chemical evolution of galaxies as they age .",
    "we have utilized all the data at our disposal , including uv imaging , h@xmath0 narrowband and spectroscopic observations , and _ spitzer _",
    "mips @xmath17  @xmath1 m imaging , to investigate the viability of rest - frame @xmath14  @xmath1 m luminosity as a star formation rate and dust indicator .",
    "we go on to show how these data indicate that the uv slopes of high - redshift galaxies are sensitive to dust in the same way as they are in the local universe ; thus the uv slope is an important proxy for inferring the bolometric luminosities of high - redshift galaxies in the absence of longer wavelength data .",
    "further analysis will benefit from observations with near - ir multi - object spectrographs allowing simultaneous coverage of at least two near - ir bands , which will allow for direct measurements of the nebular reddening via the balmer decrement for @xmath4 galaxies .",
    "future observations with the _ herschel _ space telescope will no doubt greatly extend our results .",
    "these new observations will directly sample the longer wavelength ( rest - frame @xmath329  @xmath1 m ) dust emission of at least luminous lirgs at @xmath4 , and will yield more robust measurements of the bolometric luminosities of more typical galaxies at @xmath4 .",
