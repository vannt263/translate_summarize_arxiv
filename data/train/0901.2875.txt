    "advances in experimental techniques at the nanometer scale have allowed to realize and manipulate quantum dots in a controlled way@xcite . this has permitted to study in these systems a wide spectrum of phenomena@xcite , as well as to take advantage of some properties of quantum dots to build nano - devices , such as rectifiers , amplifiers , lasers , and others @xcite . for their similitude with atoms ,",
    "quantum dots are often viewed as artificial atoms , and two or more coupled quantum dots as artificial molecules .",
    "multiple quantum dot systems , and in particular the double quantum dot ( dqd ) molecule@xcite , are of particular importance , because they are more controllable than single quantum dots .",
    "moreover , they admit different kind of connections to leads . initially , most of studies considered serial dqds@xcite , but posteriorly parallel@xcite and t - shaped @xcite configurations were also examined , emerging quantum interference effects due to the existence of different electronic paths .",
    "much attention has received the dqd molecule embedded in an aharonov - bohm ring , where the presence of a magnetic flux adds a new tool in the control of the transport properties .",
    "aharonov - bohm ( ab ) oscillations and fano effect in a dqd molecule embedded in a ring have been observed experimentally@xcite .",
    "there is much theoretical work supporting these experiments and exploring new phenomena in the dqd embedded in a ring .",
    "fano resonances and the magnetic - flux controllability of transport are examined , for example , in refs .",
    ", both in presence and the absence of electronic correlations .",
    "the existence of bound states in the continuum ( bics ) is discussed in refs . .",
    "the interplay between quantum interference and kondo physics in the parallel - coupled dqd has been also explored@xcite . a closely related system which has received attention is the ab interferometer with two embedded quantum dots@xcite .",
    "kubala and knig studied equilibrium transport in this system , finding an _ effective flux - dependent level attraction _ in the linear conductance@xcite .",
    "this effect is caused by the renormalization of levels by the leads .    from the applicability point of view ,",
    "an interesting feature exhibited by the transport through quantum dots is the negative differential conductance ( ndc)@xcite .",
    "ndc has been studied in single as well as in double quantum dot systems , and it has applications in amplifiers and oscillators in the microwave , mm - wave and terahertz frequency ranges@xcite . in multilevels quantum dots ndc can occur when states have different couplings to the leads@xcite . in a serial dqd , ndc can be produced when the bias breaks the transmission channel extended along the system@xcite .",
    "other theoretical works on generation of ndc in dqd connected in series are refs . .",
    "in a dqd embedded in an aharonov - ring , magnetic - flux - induced ndc was found in the strong interdot repulsion regime@xcite .",
    "a similar result was found by mourokh and smirnov in a dqd molecule with three terminals@xcite .",
    "recently , it was reported ndc induced by the electronic correlation in a side - coupled dqd@xcite .    in this work we study equilibrium and non - equilibrium transport through two quantum dot molecules embedded in an aharonov - bohm interferometer .",
    "we obtain analytical expressions for the transmission and we calculate numerically the current at zero temperature . in equilibrium ,",
    "the transmission exhibits fano resonances , total reflection , and suppressed peaks as a manifestation of bound states in the continuum .",
    "moreover , we find for small intramolecular couplings a flux - dependent effective level attraction and lines of perfect transmission .",
    "this effect occurs no matter how weakly coupled are the quantum dots forming each molecule .    in the non - equilibrium regime",
    ", we identify two kind of ndc regions in the @xmath0-@xmath1 characteristics , occurring at different scales and of different origin .",
    "one is generated by the usual mechanism of the ndc in a double quantum dot systems , and it is independent of the magnetic flux .",
    "the current will increase or decrease with voltage , depending on whether the voltage makes the levels of the different quantum dots become aligned or not aligned .",
    "the second ndc region is induced by the magnetic flux , and it occurs only for a definite range of intramolecular couplings . an abrupt rise of current occurs for small bias voltages as consequence of the effective level attraction of the hybridized levels produced by the magnetic flux .",
    "the decrease of current is result of the destruction of this effect when the bias voltage is increased .",
    "the system under consideration is shown in fig . [ fig1 ] .",

    "we assume that a bias voltage @xmath4 is applied between source and drain such that the site energy is @xmath5 for the left lead and @xmath6 for the right lead .",
    "we consider only one level relevant in each of the quantum dots .",
    "the system is modeled by a non - interacting anderson hamiltonian , which can be written as @xmath7 where @xmath8 describes the dynamics of the isolate molecules , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the level energy of the left ( right ) quantum dot in the molecule @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) ; @xmath13 @xmath14 annihilates ( creates ) an electron in dot @xmath15 in the molecule @xmath11 , and @xmath16 is the intramolecular tunneling hopping .",

    "the states that contribute to the net current are the states of the left lead with energies between @xmath56 and @xmath57 . evaluating ( [ eq-30])-([eq-31 ] ) , we arrive to the following expression for the current @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the transmission .",

    "in contrast , for @xmath89 the conductance decays monotonously with @xmath79 in the same interval , never reaching the quantum limit .",
    "the occurrence of maximum conductance for small values of @xmath82 is associated to an effective level attraction of the hybridized levels , similar to the discussed in ref . in an aharonov - bohm interferometer with two single - level quantum dots .",

    "larger bias voltages make the heights of the resonances fall , so that the transmission in all the window of transport becomes smaller , occurring the observed decrease in the current .",

    "we expect that the above picture remains valid even if the electron - electron interaction is taken into account .",
    "in fact , in embedded qd arrays , the main effect of the electron - electron interaction is to shift and to split the resonance positions@xcite .",
    "this occurs because the on - site coulomb repulsion energy u introduces a renormalization of the site energies . in analogy with qd arrays in series",
    ", we expect that depending on the relation between the interdot coupling and the on - site coulomb interaction different regimes arise . for @xmath121",
    ", the resonances and antiresonances would split into two distinct minibands separated by the on - site coulomb energy , while for @xmath122 , the resonances and antiresonances would occur in pairs .",
    "we think that the above behavior would not break the negative differential conductance .",
    "a work in this direction is under progress .",
    "we studied the transmission and the @xmath0-@xmath1 characteristics for two double quantum dot molecules embedded in an aharonov - bohm ring .",
    "we showed that for @xmath78 , the magnetic flux can be used to control totally the conductance , allowing this to take any value between @xmath60 and @xmath92 . when @xmath98 the flux produces an effective level attraction and lines of perfect transmission , allowing the levels to meet at the center of the band at a determinate value of the flux .",
    "on the other hand , the system displays bics when @xmath90 ( @xmath72 integer ) , and total suppression of transmission when @xmath71 @xmath72 odd . in the non - equilibrium regime , we identify two kind of ndc regions in the @xmath0-@xmath1 characteristics , occurring at different scales and of different origin . a first current peak exists at voltages of the order of the characteristic linewidth @xmath123 , and it is independent of the magnetic flux .",
    "the role of the flux in this case is to control the height of the overall current .",
    "the drop of current with the increase of bias has analogous explanation to the ndc region in a serial dqd .",
    "a second peak in the @xmath0-@xmath1 characteristics takes place only when @xmath124 , at voltages @xmath125 and it is strongly dependent on the magnetic flux .",
    "in fact , it does not exist if the flux is absent .",
    "the current suffers an abrupt rise for small bias voltages , as consequence of an effective level attraction of the hybridized levels produced by the flux .",
