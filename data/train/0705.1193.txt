    "despite their low cost and extreme versatility , modern semiconductor transistors face fundamental obstacles to continued miniaturization .",
    "first , top - down fabrication gives them microscopic variability from device to device , which , while acceptable at today s length scales , renders them unscalable in the nanometre regime .",
    "second , these devices , like all field effect devices , function by raising and lowering an energy barrier to charge transport of at least @xmath0 ; each device therefore dissipates energy of this magnitude into the environment with every switching cycle . at device densities greater than the current state of the art",
    ", the cost and engineering challenges associated with removing the resultant heat are daunting @xcite .",
    "while the first challenge can be met by utilizing the bottom - up , chemical fabrication of single - molecule devices , this approach in itself does nothing to address the need for a cooler switching mechanism .",
    "an alternative paradigm to raising and lowering an energy barrier is to exploit the wave nature of the electron to control current flow @xcite .",
    "traditionally , such interference - based devices are modulated via the aharanov ",
    "bohm effect @xcite .",
    "this , however , is incompatible with the small size of molecular devices @xcite : through a nm@xmath1 device , a magnetic field of over 600 t would be required to generate a phase shift of order 1 radian . similarly , a device based on an electrostatic phase shift @xcite would require voltages incompatible with structural stability .",
    "previously @xcite , we have proposed a solution , called the quantum interference effect transistor ( quiet ) ( see figure 1 ) , which exploits a perfect destructive interference due to molecular symmetry and controls quantum transport by introducing decoherence or elastic scattering .        the purpose of this article is to communicate the details of this proposal , including several potential chemical structures to facilitate fabrication and testing of this device . in section",

    "the quiet consists of a central molecular element , two leads chemically bonded to the molecule , and a third lead , which can be coupled to the molecule either capacitively or via tunneling .",
    "the hamiltonian of this system can be written as the sum of three terms : @xmath2 the first is the @xmath3-electron molecular hamiltonian @xmath4 where @xmath5 creates an electron of spin @xmath6 in the @xmath3-orbital of the @xmath7th carbon atom , and @xmath8 are the orbital energies .",
    "we use a tight - binding model for the hopping matrix elements with @xmath9 , @xmath10 , or @xmath11 for orbitals connected by a single bond , double bond , or within an aromatic ring , respectively , and zero otherwise .",

    "@xmath19 is the magnitude of the electron charge .",
    "each metal lead @xmath17 possesses a continuum of states , and their total hamiltonian is @xmath20 where @xmath21 are the energies of the single - particle levels in the leads , and @xmath22 is an electron creation operator . here leads 1 and 2 are the source and drain , respectively , and lead 3 is the control , or gate electrode .",
    "tunneling between molecule and leads is provided by the final term of the hamiltonian , @xmath23 where @xmath24 are the tunneling matrix elements from a level @xmath25 within lead @xmath17 to the nearby @xmath3-orbital @xmath7 of the molecule .",
    "coupling of the leads to the molecule via molecular chains , as may be desirable for fabrication purposes , can be included in the effective @xmath24 , as can the effect of substituents ( e.g. , thiol groups ) used to bond the leads to the molecule @xcite .",

    "the retarded green function of the full system is @xmath26^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is an operator , known as the retarded self - energy , describing the coupling of the molecule to the leads .",
    "the quiet is intended for use at room temperature , and operates in a voltage regime where there are no unpaired electrons in the molecule .",
    "thus lead - lead and lead - molecule correlations , such as the kondo effect , do not play an important role .",
    "electron - electron interactions may therefore be included via the self - consistent hartree - fock method .",

    "the device characteristic resembles that of a macroscopic transistor . as the voltage on lead 3",
    "is increased , scattering from the antibonding orbital of the alkene sidegroup increases as it approaches the fermi energies of leads 1 and 2 , leading to a broad peak in the current . for @xmath78 ,",
    "the device amplifies the current in the third lead ( dotted curve ) , emulating a bipolar junction transistor .",
    "alkene chains containing 4 and 6 carbon atoms were also studied , yielding devices with characteristics similar to that shown in fig .",
    "[ iv ] , with the maximum current @xmath79 shifting to smaller values of @xmath80 with increasing chain length . as evidence that the transistor behavior shown in fig .",
    "[ iv ] is due to the tunable interference mechanism discussed above , we point out that if hopping between the benzene ring and the alkene sidegroup is set to zero , so that the coupling of the sidegroup to benzene is purely electrostatic , almost no current flows between leads 1 and 2 .    for @xmath56 , @xmath81 and the quiet behaves as a field - effect transistor .",
    "the transconductance @xmath82 of such a device is shown in fig .",

    ", we note that an ideal single - electron transistor @xcite with @xmath83 has peak transconductance @xmath84 at bias voltage @xmath85 , and @xmath86 at bias @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the conductance quantum .",
    "for low biases , the proposed quiet thus has a higher transconductance than the prototypical nanoscale amplifier , while even for large biases its peak transconductance is comparable . likewise , the load resistances required for a quiet to have gain ( load times transconductance ) greater than one while in its `` on '' state are comparable to other nanoscale devices , @xmath89 .     of a quiet based on sulfonated vinylbenzene with @xmath56 .",
    "the characteristic is similar to that of a field - effect transistor , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath81 while @xmath90 .",
    "as in fig .",
    "[ iv ] , @xmath91 , and the calculation was done for room temperature . from ref .",
    "@xcite . ]",
    "operation of the quiet does not depend sensitively on the magnitude of the lead - molecule coupling @xmath92 .",
    "the current through the device decreases with decreasing @xmath93 , but aside from that , the device characteristic was found to be qualitatively similar when @xmath93 was varied over one order of magnitude .",
    "the quiet is also insensitive to molecular vibrations : only vibrational modes that simultaneously alter the carbon - carbon bond lengths and break the six - fold symmetry within the benzene component can cause decoherence in a benzene ` interferometer . '",
    "such modes are only excited at temperatures greater than about 500k .",
    "the position of the third lead affects the degree to which destructive interference is suppressed . for benzene , the most effective location for the third lead is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : quiet_3d ] .",
    "it may also be placed at the site immediately between leads 1 and 2 , but the transistor effect is somewhat reduced , since coupling to the charge carriers is less .",
    "the third , three - fold symmetric configuration of leads completely decouples the third lead from electrons traveling between the first two leads . for each monocyclic aromatic annulene , one three - fold symmetric lead configuration exists , yielding no transistor behavior .",
    "the bold lines represent the positioning of the two leads .",
    "each of the four arrangements has a different phase difference associated with it : ( a ) @xmath3 ; ( b ) @xmath94 ; ( c ) @xmath95 ; and ( d ) @xmath96 . from ref .",
    "@xcite . ]",
    "the quiet s operating mechanism , tunable coherent current suppression , occurs over a broad energy range within the gap of each monocyclic aromatic annulene ; it is thus a _ very robust effect , insensitive to moderate fluctuations of the electrical environment of the molecule_. although based on an entirely different , quantum mechanical , switching mechanism , the quiet nonetheless reproduces the functionality of macroscopic transistors on the scale of a single molecule .",
    "as daunting as the fundamental problem of the switching mechanism is the practical one of nanofabrication .",
    "the quiet requires a third lead coupled locally to the central molecule , and , while there has recently been significant progress in that direction @xcite , to date , only two - lead single molecular devices , sometimes with global gating , have been achieved @xcite . with this in mind",
    ", we turn to potential practical realizations of the device .    using novel fabrication techniques , such as ultra - sharp stm tips @xcite or substrate pitting @xcite , it may soon be possible to attach multiple leads to large molecules .",
    "fortunately , the quiet mechanism applies not only to benzene , but to any monocyclic aromatic annulene with leads 1 and 2 positioned so the two most direct paths have a phase difference of @xmath3 .",
    "furthermore , larger molecules have other possible lead configurations , based on phase differences of @xmath94 , @xmath95 , etc . ; as an example , figure [ fig:18 ] shows the lead configurations for a quiet based on [ 18]annulene .",
    "other large ring - like molecules , such as [ 14]annulene and divalent metal - phthalocyanine , would also serve well .",
    "another method of increasing the effective size of the molecule is to introduce molecular wires linking the central ring and leads ( see figures [ wires ] and [ embodiment ] ) .",
    "conducting polymers , such as polythiophene or polyaniline , are ideal for this task .",
    "such changes can be absorbed into the diagonal elements of the self - energy @xmath97 , and so only modify @xmath98 locally . as",
    "such , while they can significantly modify the on - resonance behavior of a molecular device , off - resonance function is largely unaltered . in particular ,",
    "the transmission node at the centre of the gap is unaffected .",
    "an example of such a quiet integrated with conventional circuitry on a chip is shown in figure [ embodiment ] .",
    "the quantum interference effect transistor represents one way to simultaneously overcome the problems of scalability and power dissipation which face the next generation of transistors . because of the exact symmetry possible in molecular devices , it possesses a perfect mid - gap transmission node , which serves as the off state for the device .",
    "tunably introduced decoherence or elastic scattering can lift this quantum interference effect , with the result of current modulation .",
    "furthermore , a vast variety of potential chemical structures possess the requisite symmetry , easing fabrication difficulties . in particular , molecular wires , such as conducting polymers , can be used to extend the molecule to arbitrary size .",
