    "atlas is a general purpose detector in construction at the @xmath0 collider @xmath1 at cern .",
    "it is designed to exploit the full discovery potential as given by center of mass energy of @xmath2 tev and the highest luminosity of more than @xmath3 .",
    "the optimization of the detector is driven by the requirements to detect new particles and physics processes as e.g. the higgs boson in the decay @xmath4 , heavy @xmath5and @xmath6like particles or supersymmetric particles . in the atlas detector the hadronic liquid argon ( lar ) end - cap calorimeter ( hec )  @xcite covers the pseudorapidity range @xmath7 .    to fully exploit the physics potential of atlas , an energy resolution for jets of typically @xmath8",
    "is required for the hec .",
    "the desired linearity of the energy response measured has to stay within @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the total energy containment up to the highest energies as well as an acceptable low background in the muon chambers require a calorimeter thickness of at least @xmath10 interaction lengths ( @xmath11 ) including the electromagnetic end - cap calorimeter ( emec ) in front of the hec .",
    "fast electronics is needed in order to keep the pile - up low .",
    "liquid argon technology was chosen as the active medium for its robustness against the high radiation levels present in this forward region .    in the following the status of the construction of the hec",
    "is discussed and the most recent results from the @xmath12 beam test measurements are presented .",
    "the lar hec  @xcite is a sampling calorimeter with flat copper absorber plates .",
    "it shares the two end - cap cryostats together with the emec and forward calorimeter ( fcal ) .",
    "the hec  is structured in two wheels , the front hec@xmath13 and the rear hec@xmath14 wheel , placed in the cryostat behind the emec wheel .",
    "each wheel has an outer diameter of about @xmath15 .",
    "the length of hec@xmath13 ( hec@xmath14 ) is @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the thickness of the copper absorber plates is @xmath18 for hec@xmath13 and @xmath19 for hec@xmath14 , with the first plate being half of this normal thickness in either case .",
    "each wheel is made out of @xmath20 identical modules .",
    "the weight of hec@xmath13 is @xmath21 and that of hec@xmath14 is @xmath22 . in total @xmath23 gaps for hec@xmath13 and @xmath24 gaps for hec@xmath14",
    "are instrumented with a read - out structure .",
    "longitudinally they are read out as segments of @xmath25 and @xmath24 gaps for hec@xmath13 and @xmath25 and @xmath25 gaps for hec@xmath14 .",
    "the read - out structure is based on the principle of an electrostatic transformer ( est )  @xcite .",
    "the size of the liquid argon gaps between the electrode structure is @xmath26 .",
    "the transverse granularity , driven by the aim to reconstruct the decay @xmath27 at high @xmath28 , is @xmath29 for the region @xmath30 and @xmath31 beyond @xmath32 .",
    "the hec  employs the concept of `` active pads '' : the signals from individual pads are fed into separate preamplifiers ( based on highly integrated gaas electronics ) and summed actively . the electronics boards with these ic s are positioned directly at the module periphery , the chips are operated in the liquid argon .",
    "thus the input capacitances are minimized and a short signal rise time ensured .",
    "the use of cryogenic gaas preamplifiers and summing amplifiers provides the optimum signal - to - noise ratio for the hec .",
    "the `` active pad '' electronics has been employed in more than @xmath33 cold tests with and without beam .",
    "it has proven to be very reliable .",
    "the construction of the hec  is almost finished : all the modules are assembled and have passed the cold tests , all four wheels are assembled and one full end - cap with hec@xmath13 and hec@xmath14 wheels is fully integrated into the end - cap cryostat together with the emec and the fcal .",
    "the level of high voltage ( hv ) problems after integration is @xmath34 , not causing any acceptance losses , but rather a few specific corrections for some channels . only one out of @xmath35 read - out channels is not operational , corresponding to a failure rate of @xmath36 .",
    "the @xmath12 beam test has been carried out in the h6 beam - line at the cern sps providing hadrons , electrons or muons in the energy range @xmath37 .",
    "the load in the liquid argon cryostat consisted of one emec module ( @xmath38 of the full emec wheel ) , three hec@xmath13 modules ( @xmath39 of the full hec@xmath13 wheel ) and two hec@xmath14 modules .",
    "constrained by the cryostat dimension the depth of the hec@xmath14 modules were half of the atlas modules .",
    "the impact angle of beam particles was @xmath40 with respect to the front plane , yielding a non - pointing geometry of the setup in @xmath41 ( vertically ) unlike the atlas situation .    in front of the first emec layer a presampler end - qcap module",
    "was placed inside the cryostat .",
    "it allowed studies of preshower corrections with optional additional material in front of the cryostat .",
    "finally , scintillators for triggering and timing and @xmath42 mwpcs with horizontal and vertical wire planes for beam position reconstruction were present further upstream in the beam line .",
    "in the analysis of the beam test data , the signal reconstruction follows closely the methods used in previous stand - alone beam tests of the emec  @xcite and the hec  @xcite .",
    "the output signals of the cold hec  summing amplifiers and the raw signals from the emec were carried to the front - end boards ( feb ) outside the cryostat . here",
    "the amplification of the emec signals and signal shaping of all signals was performed .",
    "the signals were sampled at a rate of @xmath43 and stored in a switched capacity array of the feb . for each event @xmath44 ( @xmath24 )",
    "samples per emec ( hec ) channel were recorded together with the mwpc response , trigger information and the tdc measured delay between the trigger and the @xmath43 sampling clock .",
    "the raw adc samples were processed with an optimal filtering ( of ) method @xcite using @xmath45 event samples .    for the hec",
    "the detailed knowledge of each component in the electronics chain and the form of the input calibration pulse was used to determine the response function , which was then used to predict the shape for the physics signals .",
    "the resulting predicted physics shapes together with the autocorrelation matrices from noise runs was used for the computation of the of weights . unlike the final situation in atlas with its fixed delay between trigger and sampling clock",
    "the beam test trigger was asynchronous with respect to the sampling clock .",
    "the of weights were therefore calculated in steps of @xmath46 in order to fill the @xmath47 trigger window and parametrized by a @xmath48 order polynomial .",
    "the accuracy for the amplitude reconstruction following this method achieved the level of @xmath49 . the required conversion factor from adc counts to na",
    "was obtained by a proper study of calibration pulse hight .",
    "the total signal deposited in the calorimeter was estimated on event by event basis using a cell - based two - dimensional topological clustering algorithm .",
    "the electronic noise @xmath50 ( in na ) for each cell was obtained by studying either muon data or time samples located outside the physics pulse time region .",
    "each cluster consisted of at least one cell with a signal - to - noise ratio above 4 ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "a threshold on the absolute value of the signal - to - noise ratio , @xmath52 , was applied to all other cells .",
    "they were included in the cluster if they shared at least one edge with a cluster member cell satisfying @xmath53 .",
    "the symmetric cuts on the cell and neighbor level avoided biases due to electronics noise .",
    "two super - clusters for the emec and the hec  were defined by summing all cluster signals in the emec and the hec respectively . for the hec  the signals in the @xmath54 layer were multiplied by @xmath14 in order to account for the @xmath55 smaller sampling fraction .",
    "from monte carlo simulations of the beam test configuration the leakage outside the emec was found to be very small for electrons and has been neglected . therefore the ratio of the known beam energy ( @xmath56 ) and the sum of all signals in the emec in na defined the electromagnetic scale factor , @xmath57 , where the error is here statistical only . the variation with energy tests the linearity in the energy range considered and was found to be better than @xmath58 .",
    "the energy resolution for electrons has been studied using the super - cluster mentioned above .    in data",
    "the energy resolution was found to be @xmath59 after noise subtraction .",
    "the noise @xmath60 varies with energy due to the non - fixed cluster size .",
    "geant3  @xcite and geant4  @xcite ) based monte carlo simulations are in good agreement with the data and yield for geant3 an energy resolution @xmath61 while geant4 yield a @xmath62 .",
    "further tuning is required for atlas to improve the fair agreement with the data .",
    "the electromagnetic scale for the hec  was taken from the previous stand - alone beam test  @xcite , @xmath63 , taking the modified electronics into account . a good agreement of the total visible energy in the emec and hec  for pions with monte carlo simulations based either on geant3 or the quark - string - gluon - plasma ( qgsp ) model of geant4",
    "is observed , while the geant4 low - and - high - energy - pion - parameterization ( lhep ) model deviate largely from data .",
    "the non - compensating nature of the two calorimeters makes weighting of hadronic energy deposits necessary . a cell based weighting method which was successfully used in previous experiments",
    "@xcite needs a detailed simulation on the cell level , which is not yet available for atlas .",
    "therefore a more coarse weighting scheme on the super - cluster level has been applied .    with the leakage outside the detector volume as predicted by the monte carlo and the known beam energy 6 weights ( 3 for the emec and 3 for the hec )",
    "have been fitted from the two super - cluster energies and their energy density , leading to the weighted energies @xmath64+c_3\\right)$ ] .",
    "is slightly worse than expected from monte carlo .",
    "the geant3 simulation predicts a @xmath66 and a geant4 lhep and qgsp simulations predict an energy resolution sampling term of @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively . in general the geant4 models",
    "seem closer to the data , but neither qgsp and lhep give an optimal description . the different energy dependence of the geant4 predictions is also reflected in non - vanishing constant terms : @xmath69 for lhep and @xmath70 for qgsp .    the ratio of the combined weighted energy of emec and hec  over the combined electromagnetic energy yield the effective @xmath71-ratio for the end - cap calorimeters ranging from @xmath72 at @xmath73 to @xmath74 at @xmath75 for pions .",
    "[ fig : eoverpi ]    shows this ratio for the data and the different mc models .",
    "the energy dependence is in all cases rather similar .",
    "however the mc predictions are here substantially below the data , with geant3 being especially low .",
