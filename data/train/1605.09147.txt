    "to date , quantum key distribution ( qkd ) provides a powerful means to establish provably secure communication  @xcite . in this perspective",
    ", qkd systems have already been commercialized , and laboratory demonstrations have achieved bit rates up to @xmath1 at a distance of 50 km  @xcite , extendible to up to 307 km  @xcite . most of the reported approaches are based on laser pulses attenuated down to the single photon level .    in order to increase these rates ,",
    "several multiplexing techniques can be exploited  @xcite . here , we focus on dense wavelength division multiplexing ( dwdm ) , where similarly to today s classical telecommunication systems , @xmath2 signals at separate wavelengths can be multiplexed in , and demultiplexed out of , a fiber link , thus increasing the achievable bit rate by a factor @xmath2",
    ". however , for protocols based on faint laser pulses or single photons , this requires employing @xmath2 sources , and , depending on the protocol , up to @xmath2 analyzers , which strongly increases the resource overhead  @xcite .    in this perspective",
    ", entanglement - based dwdm qkd has the potential of increasing bit rates with significantly less technological resources . actually , particular _",
    "single _ sources of entangled photon pairs can naturally generate a broadband flux of wavelength correlated photon pairs which can be demultiplexed into @xmath2 correlated pairs of wavelength channels  @xcite . additionally , in comparison to qkd schemes based on laser pulses , entanglement - based approaches are compatible with device - independent network - enabling protocols  @xcite .",
    "moreover , this architecture is immune to side channel attacks , making it more robust for secure communication  @xcite .",
    "although long distance entanglement distribution has already been demonstrated  @xcite , only a few experiments have considered dwdm qkd with , to date , in up to eight channel pairs  @xcite . however , in all of these realizations , the optimal analyzer settings showed a strong wavelength dependence , such that entanglement has been measured in multiple channel pairs sequentially  @xcite , _ i.e. _ the analyzer settings had to be adapted for each individual channel pair . considering that qkd implementations require measuring entanglement in two orthogonal bases , this implies that each user has to employ @xmath3 long - term stable individual analyzers , which is both impractical and resource demanding .    in principle , entanglement can be distributed using any observable .",
    "however , long - distance implementations often rely on energy - time or time - bin entanglement  @xcite , due to their immunity against polarization mode dispersion and drifts  @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "we demonstrate a scheme that requires only one entangled photon pair source and one analyzer per user and analysis basis to measure energy - time entanglement with less than 0.5% error rate in a single shot over a spectral bandwidth of @xmath4 , corresponding to @xmath5 standard 100ghz telecommunication channel pairs .",
    "we find that , compared to the standard configuration with identically unbalanced interferometers  @xcite , the number of exploitable channel pairs can be augmented by three times when properly detuning one of the analyzers .",
    "this represents a significant step towards cost - effective entanglement - based high bit rate qkd in dwdm networks .",
    "the experimental setup is shown in  [ setup ] .",
    "a continuous - wave laser operating at @xmath6 with a coherence length of @xmath7 pumps a periodically poled lithium niobate waveguide ( ppln / w ) in which energy - time entangled photon pairs are generated around the degenerate wavelength of 1540 nm by spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) .",
    "the emitted photon pairs are directly collected into a butt - coupled single - mode fiber .",
    "the corresponding emission spectrum is shown in  [ spectrum ] , for which quasi phase - matching engineering leads to a bandwidth of 55 nm @xmath8 which fully covers the commonly used telecom c - band ( @xmath9 , as well as parts of the adjacent s- ( @xmath10 ) and l - bands ( @xmath11 ) .    ,",
    "width=302 ]    , width=264 ]    due to conservation of the energy during the spdc process , the wavelengths of the paired photons @xmath12 are related to the pump laser wavelength through the following relation : @xmath13 in other words , the photons are generated pairwise symmetrically apart from the degenerate wavelength .",
    "the pairs are deterministically separated by sending long ( short ) wavelength photons to alice ( bob ) using a set of two broadband fiber bragg gratings ( fbg ) and associated circulators ( c ) .",
    "further dynamic wavelength filtering is achieved using two tunable filters with a 0.8 nm ( @xmath14 ) flat - top transmission profile , mimicking standard 100ghz dense wavelength division multiplexers . to reveal energy - time entanglement , alice and bob use each an unbalanced fiber interferometer ( franson configuration  @xcite ) ,",
    "made of a beam - splitter and two faraday mirrors .",
    "both interferometers have a path length difference of @xmath15 , can be fine tuned , and are actively stabilized using piezoelectric fiber stretchers  @xcite . at the interferometer output",
    ", alice detects her photons using a free - running ingaas single photon detector ( spd , idq id220 , 20% detection efficiency ) . at bob s site",
    ", we use an additional circulator through which we can detect photons at both interferometer outputs using gated ingaas spds ( idq id201 , 25% detection efficiency ) .",
    "+ concerning the quantum state of the photon pairs at the interferometers outputs , four contributions have to be considered .",
    "either both photons take the short or long paths ( @xmath16 or @xmath17 ) , or both photons take opposite paths ( @xmath18 or @xmath19 ) . due to the spontaneous character of the photon pair generation process",
    ", the pair creation time in the ppln / w remains unknown .",
    "this makes the contributions @xmath16 and @xmath17 indistinguishable , which leads to the observation of entanglement  @xcite .",
    "these contributions are selected using a fast coincidence logic , leading to a reduced quantum state @xmath20 where @xmath21 stands as the two - photon phase .",
    "the individual contributions , @xmath22 , are related to the interferometers path length differences by @xmath23 here , @xmath24 is the wavelength - dependent refractive index of the fibers in the interferometers . according to reference  @xcite , the rate of coincidences between detectors @xmath25 and @xmath26 follows @xmath27 , while the rate between detectors @xmath25 and @xmath28 follows @xmath29 . for entanglement - based qkd using the ekert protocol  @xcite , the analysis bases are defined by the following settings : @xmath30 in general , these conditions can not be fulfilled over a large spectral bandwidth for fixed path length differences ( @xmath31 ) , which results in a wavelength dependent two - photon phase shift . considering the setting given in equation  [ zerophase ]",
    ", this leads to an undesired non - zero anti - coincidence rate @xmath32 .",
    "the associated quantum bit error rate ( qber ) of the qkd link is then given by @xmath33 although there exist several algorithms for qber correction  @xcite , they usually require additional resources , having repercussions on the attainable bit rate of the qkd link .",
    "therefore , it is commonly acknowledged to keep the qber as low as possible  @xcite .",
    "additionally , it has been demonstrated that high - dimensional qkd is only efficient at a qber very close to zero  @xcite .",
    "for this reason , we fix the maximum allowed qber induced by improper interferometer settings to a stringent value of 0.5% , corresponding to an acceptable two - photon phase shift of @xmath34 .",
    "+   + * spectral dependence of the two - photon phase @xmath35 *    to calculate the spectral dependence of @xmath35 , we first express @xmath36 by a second order taylor series , which reads @xmath37 here , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 are the fiber refractive index , the first , and second order derivatives , respectively , at the degenerate wavelength ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "all coefficients can be inferred from sellmeier equations  @xcite . by inserting equation  [ refindex ] into equation  [ phases ] , and respecting equation  [ energy ] , we obtain @xmath42 it is often considered that the qber is minimized for @xmath43  @xcite .",
    "however , in section [ non_identical_theory ] we show that the optimal settings are rather obtained for identical path travel time differences . in this case of @xmath43 , equation  [ totalphase ] simplifies to @xmath44 in which @xmath45 is a constant as it is independent of the wavelengths of the paired photons ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "for different wavelengths @xmath47 ( and symmetrically associated wavelengths @xmath48 ) , we infer the two - photon phase @xmath35 by measuring the qber and solving equation  [ qber ] .",
    "we first align both interferometers to exactly @xmath43 .",
    "this is done by using an iterative procedure that amounts to infer the wavelength dependence of the qber for different @xmath49 until a flat distribution is found around 1540 nm .",
    "experimental results for @xmath43 are shown in  [ resultsequal ] . starting with @xmath50 at @xmath51",
    ", we reach the threshold phase shift @xmath52 at @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "consequently , these interferometers can be used to analyse entanglement with a @xmath55 for @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) simultaneously , which corresponds to 16 pairs of standard 100ghz telecommunication channels  @xcite .",
    ".[resultsequal],width=264 ]    note that fully exploiting the emission bandwidth of our photon pair source requires analysing entanglement in at least 40 pairs of 100ghz channels simultaneously .",
    "a straightforward solution would be to employ analysis interferometers made of custom - made components to shift or compensate dispersion .",
    "for example , by employing hybrid interferometers , made of single - mode and dispersion compensation fibers , instead of fully single - mode fiber interferometers , a 1.4% increase in the interference visibility was observed over a spectral bandwidth of 1.6 nm  @xcite .",
    "in the following , we demonstrate a much cheaper and simpler approach which can be applied without changing any of the components in the standard setup . we note that our strategy is not limited to fiber - based analysis interferometers only .",
    "for example , planar lightwave circuits  @xcite , where dispersion compensation is not straightforward , could also benefit from the proposed method .",
    "let us consider the different central wavelengths of alice s and bob s photons , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "note that these spectral contributions show different group velocities @xmath60 as a consequence , the wavepackets in alice s and bob s interferometers show non - identical path travel time differences between short and long arms . to match these time differences",
    ", the following equation needs to be fulfilled @xmath61 using sellmeier equations  @xcite to infer @xmath38 and @xmath39 , and @xmath62 , we fulfill equation  [ groupmatchedinterferometers ] by setting the path length difference of alice s interferometer to @xmath63 .     compared to bob s .",
    "now , the region in which the qber is below 0.5% covers 46 pairs of standard telecommunication channels , meaning that the full telecom c - band , as well as some parts of the adjacent s- and l - bands , can be exploited simultaneously for entanglement analysis.[resultsunequal],width=264 ]    the associated experimental results are shown in  [ resultsunequal ] .",
    "we have essentially shifted the curve in  [ resultsequal ] by about @xmath64 to @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "this way , we are now able to keep the two - photon phase within @xmath34 for the full emission bandwidth of our source ( @xmath65 and @xmath66 ) , allowing to analyze entanglement with a qber below 0.5% in 46 pairs of standard 100ghz telecommunication channels in a single shot .",
    "we note that the improved bandwidth fully covers the most commonly used telecom c - band , as well as some parts of the adjacent s- and l - bands .",
    "we envision the following configuration for realizing future dwdm qkd links .",
    "the tunable bandpass filters will be removed and alice is also supplied with an interferometer having two outputs ( as bob s in our current configuration , see  [ setup ] ) .",
    "wavelength division multiplexing is performed after the interferometers using standard telecom @xmath2-channel dwdms .",
    "granting security of dwdm qkd protocols requires using a second analysis basis ( see equation  [ secondbasis ] ) .",
    "this can be implemented by providing each alice and bob with a second interferometer for which the path length differences are set to @xmath67 . in this case",
    ", group velocity dispersion causes a slight additional error in @xmath68 over the full bandwidth of the source . from equation  [ phases ]",
    "we calculate that it will be below @xmath69 , which is essentially negligible for choosing two complementary bases . in a long - distance scenario ,",
    "group velocity dispersion in a standard fiber distribution link causes a broadening of the coincidence peaks such that the contributions @xmath70 and @xmath71 can not be properly post - selected .",
    "however , this problem can be conveniently overcome using dispersion compensation  @xcite and/or dispersion shifted fibers  @xcite .",
    "finally , we stress that our approach can be also applied to optimize dwdm qkd with polarization entangled photon pairs where wavelength dependent birefringence in the half - wave plates is an issue  @xcite .",
    "analogously to the strategy for energy - time entangled photon pairs , this problem could be partially compensated by either using thicker / thinner half - wave plates ( optimized for longer / shorter wavelengths ) , or by simply tilting the existing ones .",
    "in conclusion , we analysed energy - time entanglement of a broadband photon pair source using fixed unbalanced fiber interferometers , in the perspective of dwdm qkd . in the standard configuration , with identical analysis interferometers at alice s and",
    "bob s sites , group velocity dispersion limits the analysis bandwidth to 16 standard 100ghz channel pairs at a qber threshold of 0.5% .    without replacing any components in the experimental setup ,",
    "solely by properly unbalancing one of the two interferometers , we improved the analysis bandwidth to 46 channel pairs , covering not only the commonly used telecom c - band , but also some of the adjacent s- and l - bands .",
    "we stress that the number of channel pairs could be increased to 368 by using the 12.5ghz ultra - dense dwdm grid , which underlines the tremendous potential for high bit rate entanglement - based dwdm qkd .",
    "therefore , we believe that our work will have a great impact for the optimal exploitation of current and future high bit rate dwdm qkd systems , especially in combination with other multiplexing techniques .",
