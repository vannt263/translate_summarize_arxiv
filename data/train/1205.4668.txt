    ", it is well - known that there are cantor sets embedded in euclidean space such that no homeomorphism between them extends to an ambient self - homeomorphism .",
    "the first example of this phenomenon is due to antoine @xcite who constructed a cantor set in @xmath1 whose complement is not simply connected , and hence not homeomorphic to the complement of the standard dyadic cantor set .",
    "following antoine s work there has been a small industry devoted to constructing examples of _ wild _ cantor sets in @xmath1 , or more generally @xmath2 , having various pathological properties ; see for example @xcite and the references therein . in this note",
    "we construct yet another example of a wild cantor set :      to construct the cantor set @xmath5 provided by theorem [ sat1 ] we will mimic the construction of antoine s necklace , using knotted and linked @xmath6-graphs instead of circles .",
    "the bulk of the work is to give a sufficient condition for an open manifold with infinite topology to admit a complete hyperbolic metric .",
    "more concretely , we prove that an open @xmath7-manifold is hyperbolic if it admits a nested exhaustion @xmath8 such that the closure of @xmath9 is acylindrical for all @xmath10 and such that the genus of each component of @xmath11 is bounded by some constant independent of @xmath10 .",
    "this result is not going to surprise any expert on kleinian groups , and the proof uses rather standard arguments .    in this note",
    "we just prove theorem [ sat1 ] as stated above . however , an argument that is painful but relatively straightforward for experts shows that the cantor set @xmath5 can also be constructed so that _ any two orientation preserving embeddings of @xmath4 into @xmath0 are isotopic to each other _ ( compare with @xcite ) .",
    "one can also construct @xmath5 in such a way that _ the hyperbolic metric on @xmath12 is unique up to isometry_. in fact , the following is , at least from the point of view of kleinian groups , an interesting question :      also , note that , as is the case with antoine s necklace @xcite , one can use theorem [ sat1 ] to construct uncountably many homeomorphism classes of cantor set complements in @xmath0 admitting a complete hyperbolic metric .",

    "yet another characterization , due to thurston in the presence of boundary and to perelman in general , is that a compact manifold @xmath13 is truly excellent if and only if it admits a hyperbolic metric with totally geodesic boundary .",
