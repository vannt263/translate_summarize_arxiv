    "wireless _ ad hoc _ networks have emerged as a promising technology that can provide seamless communication between wireless users ( transmitter - receiver pairs ) without relying on any pre - existing infrastructure . in such networks ,",
    "the wireless users communicate with each other in a distributed manner . due to the lack of centralized coordinators to coordinate the transmissions among the users ,",
    "the wireless ad hoc network is under competitive and interference - dominant environment in nature .",
    "thereby , efficient transmission schemes for transmitters to effectively schedule / adapt their transmissions are appealing for system performance improvement , and thus have attracted wide research attentions in the past decade .",
    "traditionally , each transmitter is enabled to independently decide whether to transmit over a particular channel based on its own willingness or channel strength @xcite-@xcite , and the transmission rate of each user can be maximized by finding an optimal transmission probability or an optimal channel strength threshold , respectively .",
    "although easy to be implemented , such independent transmission schemes do not consider the resulting user interactions in the wireless ad hoc networks due to the co - channel interference , and thus do not achieve high system performance in general cases .",
    "therefore , more complex transmission schemes have been proposed to exploit the user interactions by exploring the information of signal - to - interference - ratio ( sir ) .",
    "for example , by iteratively adapting the transmit power level based on the estimated sir , the foschini - miljanic algorithm @xcite assures zero outage probability and/or minimum aggregate power consumption for uplink transmission in a cellular network . in @xcite ,",
    "yates has studied power convergence conditions for such iterative power control algorithms .",
    "moreover , there have been some recent studies ( e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) that extend the foschini - miljanic algorithm to the wireless ad hoc network through joint scheduling and power control transmission schemes .",
    "in addition , by adapting the transmission probability depending on the received sir , @xcite has studied various random access schemes to improve the system throughput and/or the user fairness . however , @xcite-@xcite either require each transmitter to know at least the wireless environment information of its neighbors , or are of high implementation complexity , and thus are not appropriate for practical large - scale wireless ad hoc networks .    on the other hand , due to the randomized location of each transmitter and the effects of channel fading ,",
    "the network - level performance analysis is fundamentally important for the study of wireless ad hoc networks .",
    "it is noted that gupta and kumar in @xcite studied _ scaling laws _ , which quantified the increase of the volume of capacity region over the number of transmitters in ad hoc networks .",
    "moreover , to determine the set of active transmitters that can yield maximum aggregate shannon capacity in the network , the authors in @xcite-@xcite addressed the capacity maximization problem for an arbitrary wireless ad hoc network .",
    "however , @xcite-@xcite did not consider the impact of _ spatial configuration _ of the ad hoc network , which is a critical factor that determines the ad hoc network capacity  @xcite .",
    "it came to our attention that as a powerful tool to capture the impact of wireless users spatial randomness on the network performance , stochastic geometry @xcite is able to provide more comprehensive characterization of the performance of wireless networks , and thus has attracted great attentions from both academy and industry @xcite , @xcite . among all the tools provided by stochastic geometry , homogeneous poisson point process ( ppp )",
    "@xcite is the most widely used one for network topology modeling and performance analysis . under the assumption that the transmitters are deployed according to a homogeneous ppp , the exact / approximate capacity of a wireless ad hoc network under various _",
    "independent _ transmission schemes , such as aloha - based random transmission @xcite , channel - inversion based power control @xcite , and channel - threshold based scheduling @xcite , @xcite , can all be successfully characterized by using advanced tools from stochastic geometry .",
    "however , limited work based on stochastic geometry has studied sir - based transmission schemes , where the _ user interactions _ are involved .",
    "it is noted that @xcite studied a probability - based scheduling scheme , where each transmitter independently adjusts its current transmission probability based on the received sir in the proceeding iteration .",
    "however , @xcite only studied the convergence of the probability - based scheduling , without addressing the network capacity with spatiality distributed users . to our best knowledge",
    ", there has been no existing work on studying the wireless ad hoc network capacity with a sir - based transmission scheme .",
    "hence , the impact of sir - based transmissions is limitedly understood from the network - level point of view .",
    "_ a principle goal of this study is to use stochastic geometry to fill the void of wireless network capacity characterization by an efficient sir - based transmission scheme . _ to this end , we propose a novel sir - threshold based scheduling scheme for a single - hop slotted wireless ad hoc network .",
    "we consider a probe - and - transmit protocol , where multi - stage probings are sequentially performed to gradually determine the transmitters that are allowed to transmit data in each slot .",
    "specifically , we assume there are in total @xmath0 probing phases and one data transmission phase in each slot , @xmath1 .",
    "we sequentially label the @xmath0 probing phases as p - phase @xmath2 , p - phase @xmath3 , ... , and p - phase @xmath4 , and label the data transmission phase as d - phase . as illustrated in fig .  1",
    ", if the feedback sir from receiver @xmath5 in p - phase @xmath6 , @xmath7 , is no smaller than a pre - defined threshold , transmitter @xmath5 decides to transmit in p - phase  @xmath8 ; otherwise , to improve the system throughput as well as save its own energy , transmitter @xmath5 stays idle in the remaining time of the slot as in @xcite , so as to let other transmitters that have higher sir levels re - contend the current transmission opportunity .",
    "since each transmitter only requires direct - channel sir feedback from its intended receiver for limited times , the proposed scheme is appropriate for distributed implementation in practical wireless ad hoc networks . in this paper , we characterize the wireless ad hoc network capacity with a metric called _ spatial capacity _ , which has been used in @xcite and gives the average number of successful transmitters per unit area for any given initial transmitter density .",
    "we aim at closed - form spatial capacity characterization and maximization by exploring the sir - threshold based transmission .    :",
    "if the sir in p - phase  @xmath6 is no smaller than the threshold @xmath9 in p - phase  @xmath8 , the transmitter decides to transmit in p - phase  @xmath8 ; otherwise , it stays idle in the remaining time of this slot .",
    ", scaledwidth=98.0% ]    the key contributions of this paper are summarized as follows .",
    "* _ novel sir - threshold based scheduling scheme : _ in section ii , we propose a novel sir - threshold based transmission scheme for a single - hop wireless ad hoc network , which can be implemented efficiently in a distributed manner . though one can use a homogeneous ppp to model the stochastic locations of the transmitters in the initial probing phase , we find that due to the iterative sir - based scheduling , the ppp model is no longer applicable to model the locations of the retained transmitters in all the subsequent probing or data transmission phases .",
    "furthermore , since the sir distributions in all the probing and data transmission phases are strongly correlated , it is challenging to analyze / characterize the spatial capacity of the proposed scheme . * _ single - stage probing for spacial capacity improvement : _ in section iii , we start up with single - stage probing ( @xmath10 ) to clearly decide the sir threshold for the proposed scheme and characterize the spatial capacity . we show that a small sir threshold can efficiently reduce the retained transmitter number and thus the interference level in the data transmission phase , while a large sir threshold will overly reduce the retained transmitter number and does not help improve the spatial capacity .",
    "we also propose a new approximate approach to characterize the spatial capacity in closed - form , which is useful for analyzing performance of wireless networks with interacted transmitters . * _ multi - stage probing for spatial capacity improvement : _ in section iv , we extend proposed scheduling scheme from the single - stage probing ( @xmath10 ) to multi - stage probing ( @xmath11 ) for greater spatial capacity improvement . we show that once a sequence of increasing sir thresholds are properly decided over probing phases , the spatial capacity is assured to gradually improve . as multi - stage probing",
    "can introduce non - ignorable overhead in each time slot , which reduces the spatial capacity , we study an interesting probing - capacity tradeoff over the probing - stage number @xmath0 . * _ performance evaluations for network design : _ in both section iii and section iv , we also provide extensive numerical results to further evaluate the impact of key parameters of the proposed scheme .",
    "in particular , we present a density - capacity tradeoff in section iii - c-1 ) , which shows that a small initial transmitter density can help improve the spatial capacity , while a large one will introduce high interference level and thus reduce the spatial capacity . to highlight the spatial capacity improvement performance of the proposed scheme ,",
    "we also compare the proposed scheme with existing distributed scheduling schemes in section iii - c-2 ) .",
    "moreover , we consider a practical scenario with sir estimation and feedback errors and show that the proposed design is robust to the sir errors in section iii - c-3 ) by simulation . in section iv , we study an example with @xmath12 and show the corresponding spatial capacity over both sir thresholds in p - phase  1 and d - phase . interestingly , our numerical results show that the former sir threshold plays a more critical role in determining the spatial capacity than the latter one , since the former sir threshold decides how many transmitters can have a second chance to contend the transmission opportunity .",
    "it is noted that some of the existing work has addressed the throughput / capacity analysis of a wireless communication system from the information - theoretic point of view .",
    "for example , tse and hanly considered a multipoint - to - point system and characterized the throughput capacity region and delay - limited capacity region of the fading multiple - access channel in @xcite and @xcite , respectively , where the optimal power and/or rate allocation that can achieve the boundary of the capacity regions was derived .",
    "although appealing , both @xcite and @xcite have assumed multiuser detection at a centralized receiver and ignored the impact of the random network topology driven by mobile transmitters and receivers mobility , and thus can not completely provide network - level system performance characterization with distributed single - user detection ( i.e. , treating the multiuser interference as noise ) receivers . unlike tse and hanly s works in @xcite and @xcite , we use stochastic geometry to model the large - scale random wireless ad hoc network topology , and novelly analyze the network - level performance of the iterative sir - threshold based scheduling .",
    "in addition , it is also noted that some existing work has adopted tools from stochastic geometry to study the non - ppp based wireless network .",
    "for example , by using a ppp to approximate the underlying non - ppp based spatial distribution of the transmitters locations , @xcite-@xcite have successfully characterized the non - ppp based wireless network capacity . unlike @xcite-@xcite , due to the iterative sir - based scheduling of the proposed scheme , we need to address not only the non - ppp based spatial distribution of the transmitters locations , but also the resulting strongly - correlated sir distributions over all probing and data transmission phases . to our best knowledge , such correlated sir analysis / chracterization in non - ppp based wireless networks has not been addressed in the existing work based on stochastic geometry .",
    "in this section , we describe the considered transmission schemes in this paper .",
    "we then develop the network model based on stochastic geometry .",
    "at last , we define the spatial capacity as our performance metric .",
    "we focus on the proposed scheme with sir - threshold based scheduling . for comparison",
    ", we also consider a reference scheme without any transmission scheduling . for both transmission schemes , we assume that all transmitters transmit in a synchronized time - slotted manner .",
    "we also assume that all transmitters transmit at the same power level , which is normalized to be unity for convenience .",
    "based on the probe - and - transmit protocol , in each time slot , @xmath0 probing phases with @xmath1 are sequentially implemented before the data transmission phase .",
    "we assume @xmath0 is a pre - given parameter and its effects will be studied later in section iv - b .",
    "moreover , as shown in fig .  1",
    ", we denote the duration of a time slot and a probing phase as @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively , with @xmath15 , such that @xmath16 , as in @xcite . by normalizing over @xmath13 , the _ effective data transmission time _ in a time slot",
    "is obtained as @xmath17 , which reduces linearly over @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we assume if a transmitter transmits probing signals in a probing phase , its intended receiver is able to measure the received signal power over the total interference power , i.e. , the sir , and feeds it back to the transmitter at the end of the probing phase .",
    "the specific algorithm design on sir estimation and feedback is out of the scope of this paper and is not our focus . to obtain tractable analysis",
    ", we assume perfect sir estimation and feedback in this paper , and thus the sir value is exactly known at the transmitter ; however , the impact of finite sir estimation and feedback errors on the network capacity is important to practical design and thus will also be evaluated by simulation .    according to the feedback sir level of its own channel",
    ", each transmitter iteratively performs the threshold - based transmission decision in each p - phase or d - phase , for which the details are given as follows :    * in the initial probing phase , i.e. , p - phase @xmath2 , to initialize the communication between each transmitter and receiver pair , all transmitters independently transmit probing signals to their intended receivers .",
    "each receiver then estimates the channel amplitude and phase ( for possible coherent communication in the subsequent probing and data transmission phases ) , and measures the received sir of the probing signal .",
    "each transmitter receives the feedback sir from its intended receiver at the end of p - phase @xmath2 . * in each of the remaining probing phases from p - phase @xmath3 to p - phase @xmath4 , by exploiting the feedback sir in the proceeding probing phase , each transmitter decides whether to transmit in the current probing phase with a predefined sir threshold . specifically , suppose a transmitter transmits in p - phase @xmath6 , @xmath18 . as shown in fig .  1",
    ", if the feedback sir in p - phase @xmath6 is larger than or equal to the predefined sir - threshold , denoted by @xmath19 for p - phase @xmath8 , the transmitter continues its transmission in p - phase @xmath8 and thus receives the feedback sir in p - phase @xmath8 ; otherwise , to improve the system throughput as well as save its energy , the transmitter decides not to transmit any more in the remaining time of this slot and will seek another transmission opportunity in the next slot , so as to let other transmitters that have higher sir levels to re - contend the current transmission opportunity . * in the d - phase , similar to the sir - threshold based scheduling from p - phase @xmath3 to p - phase @xmath4 , if a transmitter transmits in p - phase @xmath4 and its feedback sir in p - phase @xmath4 is larger than or equal to the predefined threshold , denoted by @xmath20 for the d - phase , the transmitter sends data to its intended receiver ; otherwise , the transmitter remains silent in the rest time of this slot .",
    "the data transmission is successful if the sir at the receiver is larger than or equal to the required sir level , denoted by @xmath21 .",
    "there is no transmission scheduling in the reference scheme . in each time slot , we assume all transmitters transmit data directly to their intended receivers in an independent manner . thus , the effective data transmission time for the reference scheme is @xmath3 .",
    ", but without the sir feedback to the transmitter . here",
    ", we have assumed that such training incurs a negligible time overhead as compared to each slot duration . ]",
    "the data transmission is successful if the sir at the receiver is larger than or equal to the required sir level @xmath22 as the proposed scheme .",
    "note that by implementing an initial probing phase before the data transmission , the reference scheme can be improved to be a proposed scheme with single - stage probing .      in the next , we develop the network model based on stochastic geometry . for both considered transmission schemes , we focus on single - hop communication in one particular time slot .    for both schemes , we assume that all transmitters are independently and uniformly distributed in the unbounded two - dimensional plane @xmath23 .",
    "we thus model the locations of all the transmitters by a homogeneous ppp with density @xmath24 . due to the lack of central infrastructure for coordination in the wireless ad hoc network",
    ", we assume the transmitters have no knowledge about their surrounding wireless environment , and thus intend to transmit independently in a time slot with probability @xmath25 , as in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "denote @xmath26 as the density of the initial transmitters that have the intention to transmit in a particular time slot . according to the coloring theory @xcite ,",
    "the process of the initial transmitters for both schemes is a homogeneous ppp with density @xmath27 , which is denoted by @xmath28 . without loss of generality ,",
    "we assume @xmath24 and @xmath29 and hence @xmath27 are given parameters , and will discuss the effects of @xmath27 later in section iii - c .",
    "we assume each transmitter has one intended receiver , which is uniformly distributed on a circle of radius @xmath30 meters ( m ) centered at the transmitter .",
    "we denote the locations of the @xmath5-th transmitter and its intended receiver as @xmath31 , with @xmath32 , and @xmath33 ( not included in @xmath28 ) , respectively .",
    "the path loss between the @xmath5-th transmitter and the @xmath34-th receiver is given by @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the path - loss exponent .",
    "we use @xmath37 to denote the distance - independent channel fading coefficient from transmitter @xmath5 to receiver @xmath34 .",
    "we assume flat rayleigh fading , where all @xmath37 s are independent and exponentially distributed random variables with unit mean .",
    "we also assume that @xmath37 s do not change within one time - slot .",
    "we denote the sir at the @xmath5-th receiver as @xmath38 , which is given by @xmath39 note that for the reference scheme without transmission scheduling , @xmath38 gives the received sir level at the @xmath5-th receiver for the data transmission of transmitter @xmath5 . as a result , in the reference scheme , the data transmission of transmitter @xmath5 is _ successful _ if @xmath40 is satisfied .",
    "unlike the reference scheme , in the proposed scheme , @xmath38 only gives the received sir level at the @xmath5-th receiver in the initial probing phase p - phase  @xmath2 .",
    "we then denote the point process formed by the retained transmitters in p - phase @xmath8 with @xmath7 , or the d - phase with @xmath41 , as @xmath42 .",
    "we also denote @xmath43 as the received sir at the @xmath5-th receiver in @xmath42 . clearly , we have @xmath44 , where the number of transmitters in @xmath42 is reduced as compared to that in @xmath45 .",
    "thus , it is easy to verify that @xmath46 for any given @xmath47 , @xmath48 .",
    "moreover , similar to @xmath38 , for any @xmath42 , @xmath49 , we can express @xmath43 as @xmath50 it is worth noting that due to the sir - based scheduling , the transmitters are not retained independently in @xmath42 .",
    "thus , unlike @xmath38 in ( [ eq : sir_0_pilot ] ) , which is determined by the homogeneous ppp @xmath28 , @xmath43 in ( [ eq : sir_k ] ) is determined by the _ non - ppp _ @xmath42 in general @xcite . for the proposed scheme ,",
    "the data transmission of transmitter  @xmath5 is _ successful _ if @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 are all satisfied .      due to the stationarity of the homogeneous ppp @xmath28 , it is easy to verify that @xmath42 , @xmath54 , is also stationary @xcite .",
    "we thus consider a typical pair of transmitter and receiver in this paper . without loss of generality , we assume that the typical receiver is located at the origin . the typical pair of transmitter and receiver is named pair 0 , i.e. , @xmath55 .",
    "denote the _ successful transmission probability _ of the typical pair in the data transmission phase of the proposed scheme with @xmath0 probing phases or the reference scheme as @xmath56 or @xmath57 , respectively .",

    "we then have the following proposition .",

    ", we find that @xmath57 in ( [ eq : suc_prob_stage_1 ] ) monotonically decreases over @xmath27 as expected . moreover , from ( [ eq : c_r_def ] ) and ( [ eq : suc_prob_stage_1 ] ) , we can obtain the expression of @xmath60 as @xmath68 it is observed from ( [ eq : c_r ] ) that unlike @xmath57 , the spatial capacity @xmath60 does not vary monotonically over @xmath27 , since @xmath60 can be benefited by increasing @xmath27 if the resulting interference is acceptable .",
    "moreover , from ( [ eq : suc_prob_stage_1 ] ) and ( [ eq : c_r ] ) , it is also expected that both @xmath57 and @xmath60 monotonically decrease over the distance @xmath30 between each transmitter and receiver pair , due to the reduced signal power received at the receiver , and decrease over the required sir level @xmath22 .    unlike the reference scheme , which is determined by the homogeneous ppp @xmath28",
    ", the proposed scheme is jointly determined by @xmath28 and a sequence of non - ppps @xmath69 , @xmath70 , where the resulting sir distributions are correlated .",
    "therefore , it is very difficult to analyze / characterize the spatial capacity of the proposed scheme with @xmath0 probing phases . to start up , in the next section",
    ", we focus on a simple case with single - stage probing ( @xmath10 ) for some insightful results .",
    "in this section , we consider the proposed scheme with single - stage probing , i.e. , @xmath10 . in this case , there is only one round of sir - based scheduling , which is implemented with the threshold @xmath71 . for notational simplicity , for the case of @xmath10 , we omit the superscript @xmath0 and use @xmath72 and @xmath73 to represent the successful transmission probability and the spatial capacity of the typical transmitter , respectively . based on ( [ eq : p_succ_p_def ] ) , the successful transmission probability for the case of @xmath10 is reduced to @xmath74 moreover , when @xmath10 , the effective data transmission time for the proposed scheme is @xmath75 .",
    "since @xmath15 , we assume the single - stage probing overhead is negligible ; and thus , the effective data transmission time becomes 1 as the reference scheme .",

    "one issue needs to be properly addressed is the power convergence in the stochastic network . unlike the power convergence studied in @xcite and @xcite for deterministic wireless networks , the transmit power level of each transmitter in the current probing phase",
    "is stochastically determined by the sir distributions in all the proceeding probing phases . moreover , due to the different point process formed by the retained transmitter in each probing phase , the sir distributions in all the probing phases are mutually different . although challenging , it is of our interest to find the condition that assures the power convergence in our considered stochastic network , and study the spatial capacity in a stable system with converged power level of each transmitter .",
    "in addition , we are also interested to extend our current study on synchronized transmission to the asynchronized transmission in our future work . unlike the synchronized transmission , due to the newly added transmitters in each probing phase , it is more difficult to control and analyze the interference in each probing phase",
    ". moreover , note that the asynchronized transmission may cause unstable communication quality for the transmitters .",
    "it is thus of our interest to design effective transmission scheme that can assure stable communication quality for all the transmitters , by effectively controlling the network interference to improve the spatial capacity in our future work .",
