    "ull - duplex ( fd ) is a promising technique to increase the spectral efficiency in relay systems .",
    "however , the performance of fd relay suffers from the self interference ( si ) @xcite .",
    "although natural isolation and time - domain cancellation can be applied for mitigation of si , measurements show that residual si still exists @xcite . to this end",
    ", null - space projection using multiple antennas is proposed in one - way relay systems @xcite .",
    "furthermore , since zero - forcing ( zf ) may harm the desired signal , relay beamforming design based on minimum mean square error ( mmse ) is also proposed for one - way relays @xcite .",
    "very recently , fd two - way relay channel ( twrc ) receives significant attentions @xcite , while the majority of literatures focus on the single antenna scenario @xcite . to analyze the performance of multi - antenna fd twrc , beamforming design based on zf",
    "is proposed in @xcite .",
    "however , it is known that the method in @xcite is suboptimal due to the manually added zf constraint . on the other hand , beamforming design which _ reserves a fraction of si _ can overcome the drawback of @xcite , and currently has not been discussed in fd twrc .",
    "this paper provides the _ first attempt _ to design such beamformers by solving the signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) quality - of - service ( qos ) constrained beamforming design problem .",
    "compared with one - way relays , the considered problem in fd twrc involves a single beamformer serving multiple users , and the mmse based method in @xcite is not applicable .",
    "furthermore , due to the loop self - interference @xcite , the relay transmit power and users sinrs are nonlinear fractional , leading to a challenging nonconvex problem .    to solve the nonconvex problem , a convergence guaranteed alternating optimization ( ao ) algorithm is proposed to divide it into four subproblems . in particular , the subproblems of relay beamformers , user transmitters , and user receivers are solved using successive convex approximation ( sca ) , second - order cone programming ( socp ) , and mmse criterion , respectively . besides",
    ", a low - complexity zf based design is presented as a benchmark .",
    "finally , numerical results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing algorithms , and achieves a transmit power close to the ideal case .",
    "we consider a fd - twrc system consisting of a relay station and two users .",
    "the relay , the first user , and the second user are equipped with @xmath0 transmit antennas and @xmath1 receive antennas , respectively . as shown in fig .",
    "1 , the two users have no direct link and wish to exchange information through the relay . with the help of fd , the communication only requires one transmission phase , and all the nodes transmit their signals simultaneously .",
    "@xmath32    to provide reliable communication for both users at their required sinr threshold , we must have @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the sinr requirement at the @xmath6 user . on the other hand , having the qos requirement satisfied , it is crucial to reduce the total transmit power for cost reduction and environment benefits . therefore , we can write the sinr qos constrained beamforming design problem as @xmath35 .",
    "the optimization problem @xmath35 is carried out at the relay node .",
    "the channel state information ( csi ) of @xmath36 is available at relay using pilots .",
    "the csi of @xmath37 can be obtained with channel reciprocity .",
    "the csi of @xmath38 can be obtained from feedback of users .",
    "however , @xmath35 is difficult to solve because variables @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are coupled , and the terms of @xmath39 are nonlinear fractional . to decouple the variables @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , we propose the ao algorithm @xcite in the next section .    @xmath46",
    "@xmath51 is challenging because the objective function is quadratic fractional and the constraints are quartic . to tackle it",
    ", we introduce a slack variable @xmath52 , which is equivalent to @xmath53 \\succeq 0\\ ] ] according to schur complement lemma @xcite .",
    "then the objective function becomes @xmath54 , which is linear in @xmath55 . to further transform into a linear matrix inequality ( lmi )",

    "specifically , rearrange the left hand side of as @xmath58 moreover , to deal with the quartic term on the right hand side of , introduce slack variable @xmath59 .",
