    "knowledge of the transport properties of particles embedded in a turbulent gas medium is important in many aspects of protoplanetary disc modeling .",
    "if the spatial number density distribution of dust grains in a disc is required for the model , one must know the effect of turbulent diffusion on the dust grains .    _ vertical diffusion _  the distribution of tiny dust grains , with radii smaller than around 100 @xmath1 m , determines the observability of protoplanetary discs around young stellar objects through their contribution to the infrared parts of the spectrum .",
    "an interesting observational effect of turbulent diffusion is its influence on the vertical settling of dust grains .",
    "the settling affects the spectral energy distribution of protoplanetary discs , since flaring discs , i.e.  where the scale height of the gas density increases with radial distance , have a much stronger mid- to far - infrared excess than self - shadowing discs , where the scale height after a certain distance from the protostar begins to fall with radial distance ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "recent model calculations by @xcite show that the vertical settling of dust grains towards the mid - plane of the disc can change an initially flaring disc into a partially self - shadowing disc , thus effecting the observability of the disc",
    ". these calculations depend  among other things  on the strength of the turbulence in the disc ( the turbulent viscosity ) and on the turbulent diffusion coefficient of dust grains in the direction perpendicular to the disc mid - plane . also , @xcite recently considered the effect of vertical mixing in protoplanetary discs on the distribution of various chemical species and found the distribution to be influenced greatly by mass transport processes , again underlining the importance of vertical turbulent diffusion in the modeling of protoplanetary discs .    _ radial diffusion _",
    " crystalline silicate dust grain features observed in comet spectra are often attributed to radial mixing in the solar nebula ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "silicate dust grains are formed primarily in amorphous form , but they can become crystalline if exposed to temperatures above @xmath2 k. such a heating can obviously have occurred in the hot inner parts of the solar nebula , whereas comets are expected to have formed in the cold outer regions of the nebula , so in this picture some radial mixing must take place between the inner and outer nebula . @xcite",
    "consider disc models where crystallization of silicates happens in the inner , hot parts of the disc .",
    "they calculate that in a few times @xmath3 years the crystalline silicate fraction reaches a uniform value outside the crystallization region due to radial turbulent diffusion , and that the value can approach unity for realistic disc parameters . from high resolution observations of three protoplanetary discs , @xcite find that the inner 1 - 2 au of these discs contain a higher crystalline silicate fraction than the outer 2 - 20 au .",
    "this supports the theory that crystalline dust grains form in the hot inner disc and are subsequently transported to the outer disc by turbulent gas motion .",
    "the existence of chondrules ( millimeter - sized solid inclusions found in primitive meteorites , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is believed to be the result of collisions and coagulation of small dust grains @xcite .",
    "the size distribution of chondrules may be explained by selective sorting in the turbulent solar nebula @xcite .",
    "the first step in planet formation is the build - up of kilometer - sized rocky and icy planetesimals ( in the planetesimal hypothesis of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , either from sticking or due to a gravitational instability in the vertically settled dust layer . in the latter case ,",
    "the equilibrium scale height of the dust layer is determined by the turbulent diffusion coefficient of the dust grains in the vertical direction @xcite .",
    "an alternative planet formation hypothesis , the gravitational instability hypothesis ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , states that planets form as a direct gravitational instability in the gas of a protoplanetary disc .",
    "the ability of a disc to undergo gravitational instability depends on its density and temperature structure , which is again dependent on the distribution and thus the turbulent transport of tiny dust grains .",
    "it is a modern paradigm of protoplanetary discs that shear instabilities in the gas flow lead to turbulence , which is again responsible for such diverse effects as heating , angular momentum transport and diffusion .",
    "the actual turbulence is often parametrized in a single parameter , the turbulent viscosity ( which can be non - dimensionalized into the @xmath4-value of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this single parameter determines both heating , angular momentum transport and diffusion .",
    "candidates for protoplanetary disc turbulence are many .",
    "most pronounced linear instabilities are vertical convective instability @xcite and the magnetorotational instability @xcite , although the former has proved to lead to inward rather than outward transport of angular momentum @xcite .",
    "other instabilities have been proposed , such as the baroclinic instability of @xcite which must be non - linear according to @xcite , a linear rossby wave instability @xcite and a linear stratorotational instability @xcite .",
    "today s most accepted source of turbulence is magnetorotational turbulence ( mri ) . for completely ionized discs , the emergence of self - sustained turbulence through the linear magnetorotational shear instability seems inevitable , both in local shearing box simulations @xcite and in global accretion disc simulations @xcite .",
    "the application of the ideal mhd equations to protoplanetary discs is only justified where the ionization fraction is relatively high ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this may be given in the hot and dust - free inner parts of the disc , as well as away from the mid - plane of the disc and at large radial distances where the ionization is determined by cosmic ray and high energy photon penetration .",
    "in protoplanetary discs this had lead to the concept of a magnetically dead zone near the mid - plane of the disc where the ionization fraction is too low to sustain mri .",
    "@xcite consider local shearing box simulations with a vertically dependent ionization fraction and find that some turbulent stresses are induced in the dead zone by the surrounding mri turbulence .",
    "thus angular momentum can be transported even in regions of the disc that are not magnetorotationally unstable .",
    "it is often assumed that turbulent transport takes place as diffusion . for dust grains ,",
    "the turbulent flux is assumed proportional to the gradient of the dust - to - gas ratio @xcite .",
    "such a prescription does not per se determine a certain value for the turbulent diffusion coefficient .",
    "hence it is often parametrized to be a scalar that is equal to the turbulent viscosity of the gas for tiny grains but falls gradually for larger and larger grain sizes @xcite .",
    "one argument for setting the turbulent diffusion coefficient equal to the turbulent viscosity is that the radial velocity fluctuations are the base of both ( non - magnetic ) angular momentum transport and diffusion @xcite .",
    "such an approach is simple to use , but caution should be taken regarding its validity , both regarding the numerical value of the turbulent diffusion coefficient and regarding the isotropy that is implicitly assumed when making it a scalar .",
    "the validity of the whole diffusion description must also be addressed an obvious cause of concern is the presence of dust - trapping mechanisms in the turbulent gas flow .",
    "gas turbulence and global pressure gradients , e.g.  from vertical and radial stratification , are the cause of two important trapping mechanisms .",
    "whenever the gas is pressure - supported and in force balance , the embedded dust grains feel an excess force in the opposite direction to the gas pressure gradient , since they can never be in the same force equilibrium without pressure support .",
    "the dust grains thus feel an acceleration relative to the gas .",
    "this has various effects , e.g.vertical settling of the dust layer towards the mid - plane of protoplanetary discs or inward radial drift of dust grains if there is an outwards decreasing gas pressure in the disc , a notorious problem in planet formation @xcite .",
    "the dust grains reach a terminal velocity when the friction with the gas balances out the acceleration due to the missing pressure gradient .",
    "the terminal velocity of very small dust grains is proportional to the friction time . in non - turbulent disc models",
    "only global pressure gradients are present , but in a turbulent disc local , fluctuating regions of high and low pressure are expected to occur .",
    "then dust grains continuously move up the local pressure gradient , and this contributes to the random motion of the grains , which is responsible for turbulent diffusion .",
    "magnetic pressure gradients actually give the same effect , as we will show analytically in sect .",
    "[ ch : shorttaufappr ] . a local concentration of dust grains",
    "can not be described as diffusion , so one of the goals of this paper is to test the validity of the global diffusion picture in the presence of turbulent pressure gradient trapping .    for larger dust grains , where the friction time becomes comparable to the orbital period of the disc , another important dust - trapping mechanism sets in .",
    "stationary rotational structures in the gas ( e.g.  anticyclones ) are given by an equilibrium between the global coriolis force from the rotating disc and the centrifugal force of the rotating structure .",
    "as they enter such a structure , large dust grains experience a slow acceleration , due to drag forces with the gas . rotating initially with the gas , but much slower",
    ", the coriolis force dominates over the centrifugal force , and the dust grains are sucked into the eddy .",
    "this vortex trapping was proposed by @xcite , and has since then been subject of much theoretical investigation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the conclusions are that vortices are extremely efficient at trapping dust grains , and this efficiency may even explain how gas planets are formed before the dispersion of the gas disc @xcite . vortex trapping would seem to be potentially even more threatening to the global diffusion description than pressure gradient trapping .",
    "in this paper we measure the turbulent diffusion coefficient of dust grains directly from numerical simulations of three - dimensional magnetorotational turbulence .",
    "we treat the physics of protoplanetary discs in the shearing sheet approximation , in which a local coordinate frame corotating with the disc is considered .",
    "dust is added as an extra fluid that interacts with the gas through a drag force .",
    "the turbulent diffusion coefficient is measured by exposing the dust fluid to an external force field and then comparing the resulting dust density with analytical expressions derived with a parametrized diffusion term . by comparing the measured value to the turbulent viscosity",
    "we examine whether the two are indeed equal as is often assumed .",
    "we specifically address the question of whether the diffusion coefficient is isotropic by measuring diffusion in both the vertical and the radial direction .",
    "finally we quantify the effect of dust - trapping mechanisms on the whole diffusion picture by examining correlations between turbulent gas features and the dust - to - gas ratio .",
    "the paper is built up as follows . in sect .",
    "[ ch : dynamical_equations ] we describe the dynamical equations for the motion of gas and dust and the computer code that we use to solve them numerically .",
    "then we go into details in sect .",
    "[ ch : diffusion_coefficient ] about how we deduce the turbulent diffusion coefficient from computer simulations by comparing the equilibrium dust density with analytical expressions . in sect .",
    "[ ch : units ] we describe the units and the boundary conditions of the simulations .",
    "the results are described in the following two sections ; sect .",
    "[ ch : evolution_gas ] describes the turbulent evolution of the gas while sect .",
    "[ ch : evolution_dust ] describes the evolution of the dust , especially the measured turbulent diffusion coefficients and diffusion prandtl numbers and the presence of dust - trapping mechanisms in the gas .",
    "finally conclusions , discussions and some outlook to potential further investigations into the subject of turbulent diffusion of dust grains appear in sect .",
    "[ ch : conclusions ] .",
    "in this section we present the dynamical equations we use for gas velocity , gas density , magnetic vector potential , dust velocity and dust density . we integrate the dynamical equations using the pencil code .",
    "this is a finite difference code that uses sixth order centered spatial derivatives and a third order runge - kutta time - stepping scheme .",
    "see @xcite for details on the numerical schemes and test runs .",
    "the pencil code solves the dynamical equations in their non - conservative form and gives very similar results to the zeus code for the statistical properties of mri turbulence ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the pencil code requires artificial diffusivity terms in the dynamical equations to stabilize the finite difference numerical scheme . for the purpose of calculating turbulent diffusion coefficients",
    "it is vital that we can reduce the artificial mass diffusion as much as possible in order to distinguish the measured turbulent diffusion from the imposed artificial diffusion .",
    "the biggest contribution to the turbulent transport of dust grains is expected to come from the fast and far moving large scales , so keeping the large scales unaffected by diffusion is important . to achieve this we use hyperdiffusivity terms in all the dynamical equations .",
    "hyperdiffusivity involves replacing the regular diffusivity terms ( involving second order derivatives ) with differential operators that use higher order derivatives .",
    "this quenches unstable modes at the smallest scales of the simulation , while at the same time the large scales are kept unaffected by diffusivity .",
    "we have checked , by varying the value of the artificial diffusion coefficient , that hyperdiffusion does not have any effect on the turbulent diffusion coefficients that we measure .",
    "the use of hyperdiffusivity is discussed further in appendix  [ ch : hyperdiffusivity ] . there",
    "the hyperversions that we adopt for viscosity , mass diffusion and resistivity are also presented .    in this section",
    "we also develop a method for being able to treat numerically the motion of very tiny dust grains with friction times much shorter than the computational time - step of the gas .",
    "this so - called short friction time approximation is presented and discussed in the last part of the section .",
    "we consider the motion of gas and dust in the shearing sheet approximation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    ", the keplerian flow velocity field has the linearized form @xmath10 .",
    "we choose to measure velocities relative to the keplerian flow , @xmath11 .",
    "such a transformation introduces new shear terms in the equation of motion , but it has the advantage that the keplerian velocity is zero everywhere .",
    "the equation of motion relative to the main shear flow in the shearing sheet approximation is @xmath12 the first term on the right hand side of equation ( [ eq : gasmomentumeq ] ) is the advection due to any velocity relative to the main shear flow , while the second term covers the advection due to the shear flow .",
    "the function @xmath13 is defined as @xmath14 and is an effect of coriolis force .",
    "the last three terms in equation ( [ eq : gasmomentumeq ] ) are the pressure gradient force , the magnetic lorentz force ( where the volume current density @xmath15 is defined through ampre s law @xmath16 ) , and a hyperviscosity term based on the function @xmath17 defined in equation ( [ eq : fnu_3rd ] ) .",
    "we ignore the effect of vertical gravity on the gas , because we are interested in the ideal case to measure the isotropy / non - isotropy of magnetorotational turbulence and the local transport properties of the gas without introducing additional isotropy - breaking effects .",
    "ignoring the stratification effectively means that we are considering the disc close to the mid - plane where the vertical gravity is vanishing . future work on the properties of dust diffusion in local shearing box simulations should take the vertical stratification of the disc into account .",
    "the evolution of the gas density @xmath18 is determined by the continuity equation @xmath19 where the first term on the right hand side is again an effect of advection due to the main shear flow .",

    "any pressure gradient force on the dust due to collisions between dust grains and gas molecules can also be ignored since the solid density of dust grains is so large that the resulting acceleration is negligibly small .    in the fluid approach ,",
    "the equation of motion for the dust velocity relative to the keplerian flow is @xmath29 the first four terms on the right hand side appear similar here as in the gas momentum equation .",
    "the last two terms in equation ( [ eq : dustmomentumeq ] ) are the drag force and an externally imposed force field @xmath30 that we use to drive a non - zero diffusion equilibrium in the dust density .",
    "this is explained in more detail in sect .",
    "[ ch : diffusion_coefficient ] .",
    "we let the dust and the gas couple through a drag force proportional to , but in the opposite direction of , the velocity difference between the dust and the gas .",
    "the strength of the drag force is characterized by the friction time @xmath31 . any relative motion between dust and gas",
    "is damped by the drag force with an e - folding time of @xmath31 .",

    "the friction time of a spherical dust grain with radius @xmath32 and solid density @xmath33 can be expressed as @xmath34 where @xmath23 is the sound speed in the surrounding gas and @xmath18 is the gas density .",
    "the sound speed and the gas density are approximately constant in the unstratified and isothermal case , so we can treat @xmath31 as constant that depends only on the given particle radius and solid density .    treating dust as a fluid",
    "is justified as long as the mean free path of the fluid constituents is smaller than the typical dimensions of the system . in the case of the gas ,",
    "one compares the mean free path of the molecules with the thickness of the disc @xmath35 . for the dust grains the collisions among the grains themselves are unimportant for determining a mean free path . here",

    ", this value can be determined as @xmath37 .",
    "the condition for treating dust as a fluid is then that @xmath38 . because all motions are subsonic",
    ", we can replace @xmath36 by @xmath23 as an upper limit and get the expression @xmath39 for the validity of the fluid approach .    in a typical solar nebula type protoplanetary disc ,",
    "the scale height is of the order of @xmath40 cm at @xmath41 , while the gas density can be taken to @xmath42 at the same radial distance .",
    "then the connection between grain radius and dimensionless friction time is @xmath43 this means that , as a rule of thumb , the value of the dimensionless friction time corresponds to the radius of the dust grain measured in meters .    to preserve momentum",
    "the gas should be affected by a drag force @xmath44 from the dust . here",
    "@xmath45 is the dust - to - gas ratio .",
    "we shall ignore the back - reaction drag force from the dust on the gas , because the dust - to - gas ratio is small in the early stages of a protoplanetary disc .",
    "we represent dust mass density by the number density @xmath46 of dust grains .",
    "the continuity equation for the dust number density @xmath46 is @xmath47 where we use artificial diffusion , through the function @xmath48 defined in equation ( [ eq : fd_3rd ] ) , only to stabilize the numerical scheme . by varying the value of the artificial diffusion coefficient @xmath49 , which is defined in appendix  [ ch : hyperdiffusivity ] ,",
    "we have made sure that adding artificial diffusion has no effect on the measured turbulent diffusion coefficients .",
    "the value of @xmath49 needed to stabilize the runs are for all runs several orders of magnitude below the measured turbulent diffusion coefficient .",
    "we now have two possibilities to solve the dust equation of motion ( eq . ) : for large particles , with friction times larger than the courant time - step ( @xmath50 , see table [ t : rundescrps ] ) , we can use the explicit integration scheme from the pencil code .",
    "but for the smaller particle cases ( @xmath51 ) , where the friction time is much shorter than the courant time - step , we will use the short friction time approximation , a semianalytical time integration that is presented below .",
    "the radii of dust grains observed in protoplanetary discs are often on the order of micrometers or even nanometers .",
    "the friction time of microscopic dust grains in a protoplanetary disc is very short compared to the orbital period , around a few minutes for the location of jupiter in a typical solar nebula .",
    "that is of course not a problem for nature , but the smallest scales of computer simulations are many orders of magnitude larger than in nature , and thus the computational time - step for an explicit code such as the pencil code is much larger than the friction time of tiny dust grains .",
    "this causes a potential problem in resolving both timescales at the same time . to follow the motion of the tiniest dust grains , applying the explicit integration scheme as used in the pencil code",
    ", a time - step must be chosen that is at least an order of magnitude shorter than the friction time .",
    "thus the computation time for simultaneously following the evolution of gas and dust becomes prohibitively long .",
    "one can now either use an implicit integration scheme , which would introduce further problems , and also make major changes in the code necessary , or one can use a kind of semianalytical integration scheme that works as follows .",
    "for very short friction times , the dust is able to settle to an equilibrium velocity , where the drag force is exactly balanced by the other force terms that are present in the dust equation of motion ( eq . ) , on a timescale that is much shorter than the computational time - step of the gas .",
    "thus it is possible , under a few reasonable assumptions , to solve algebraically for the terminal dust velocity as a function of gas velocity and density . to do this , we first subtract the gas equation of motion ( eq .  [ [ eq : gasmomentumeq ] ] ) from the dust equation of motion ( eq .  [",
    "[ eq : dustmomentumeq ] ] ) .",
    "this results in an equation for the evolution of relative velocity @xmath52 , @xmath53 where the viscosity terms have been ignored since any real physical viscosity is expected to be orders of magnitude weaker than the other force terms .",
    "we now assume that the computational time - step of the gas is much longer than the friction time , @xmath54 . here",
    "@xmath55 will be given by the courant criterion .",
    "this criterion determines the maximum time - step that can be taken by an explicit numerical scheme without becoming unstable .",
    "the allowed time - step gets shorter with increasing grid resolution . with the condition @xmath54",
    ", all terms from the gas equation of motion can be considered to be constant for the duration of the acceleration of the dust grain to its terminal velocity .",
    "this specifically also applies to the pressure gradient force and the lorentz force that are present also in equation ( [ eq : dwminudt ] ) .",
    "then we can search for a time - independent equilibrium solution for @xmath52 .",
    "we expect any time - independent solution of equation ( [ eq : dwminudt ] ) to have a dust velocity that is very close to the gas velocity , because the short friction time couples the dust velocity strongly to the gas velocity .",
    "setting therefore @xmath56 in all other terms than the drag force term ( this is legitimized below ) leaves the algebraic equilibrium equation @xmath57 solving for @xmath58 then yields @xmath59 \\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : w_sfta}\\ ] ] reinserting this solution into equation ( [ eq : dwminudt ] ) shows that it was reasonable to ignore all advection , shear and coriolis terms , while keeping the friction , gravity , pressure gradient and lorentz terms , as long as the friction time is sufficiently short .",
    "this is the short friction time approximation .",
    "the specific form of the short friction time dust velocity approximation depends on the forces that are assumed to work on the gas and on the dust , so equation ( [ eq : w_sfta ] ) is only valid for the specific choice of force terms that are considered in this work .",
    "the presence of gravity in the dust velocity approximation comes from only considering gravity to work on the dust .",
    "this is is good for the purpose of measuring the turbulent diffusion coefficient , whereas in nature gravity of course affects both dust and gas .",
    "the gravity term would then drop out of the short friction time approximation , but it would reappear in the form of the vertical pressure gradient of the stratified gas .",
    "one must also take into consideration that the dust velocity in equation ( [ eq : w_sfta ] ) is expressed as a function of the resolved part of the gas velocity only .",
    "all unresolved small scales would also contribute to the random motion of the tiny dust grains ( as would brownian motion ) , but the important scales for turbulent transport are the largest scales in the box , since they contribute most to the total gas velocity field .",
    "the equilibrium dust velocity given by the short friction time approximation ensures that the relative velocity between dust and gas does not change on timescales shorter than the computational time - step .",
    "that means that if the gas is being accelerated , then the same amount of acceleration must be working on the dust , and so the relative velocity between the dust and the gas stays constant until sufficient time has passed for the pressure gradient force and the lorentz force to change at the computational timescale .",
    "the @xmath60th component of the lorentz force appearing in equation ( [ eq : w_sfta ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath61 where the first term in the parenthesis on the right hand side is due to magnetic pressure and the second to magnetic tension .",
    "this allows the @xmath60th component of the short friction time approximation dust velocity to be rewritten as @xmath62 \\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : w_sfta_2}\\ ] ] thus dust grains move relative to the gas not only because of ( additional ) gravity and ( missing ) pressure gradient force , but also due to ( missing ) magnetic pressure gradient force and ( missing ) magnetic tension .",
    "we shall still refer to the effect as pressure gradient trapping , even though the magnetic tension term in equation ( [ eq : w_sfta_2 ] ) does not mimic a pressure gradient .",
    "we must stress again that the short friction time approximation is only valid for small particles .",
    "if one considers larger bodies ( e.g.  @xmath63 mm at @xmath41 in a typical solar nebula ) , first the coriolis forces and then the advective transport terms can no longer be ignored . for these particles",
    "we directly integrate the dust equation of motion ( eq . [ [ eq : dustmomentumeq ] ] ) together with the other dynamical equations . with even larger objects",
    "finally the fluid approach fails as soon as @xmath64 . in this case one",
    "has to apply a particle algorithm to follow the dust evolution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in this section we describe how we calculate the diffusion coefficient of dust grains embedded in a turbulent gas .",
    "we do this by comparing the results of numerical simulations with analytical solutions to the non - turbulent flow equations that include a parametrized diffusion .",
    "if the turbulent motion of the gas and the dust has not been resolved , the continuity equation of the dust would have to incorporate an explicit diffusion term , @xmath65 \\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : conteq_dust_lam}\\ ] ] the gas flow is here assumed to be completely stationary , and the only effect of the non - resolved turbulence is through the parametrized diffusion term .",
    "the continuity equation is written in a conservative form where the diffusion flux is proportional to and in the opposite direction of the gradient of the dust - to - gas ratio .",
    "this is the way turbulent diffusion is normally assumed to act ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the task now is to find a way to extract @xmath66 from the non - stationary turbulent motion found in computer simulations .",
    "this is only possible if @xmath67 is not zero everywhere , as otherwise the diffusion coefficient does not enter equation ( [ eq : conteq_dust_lam ] ) at all for a constant @xmath18 .",
    "one can now either follow the time dependent diffusion of an initial dust concentration somewhere in the center of the box or look for a time independent equilibrium solution .",
    "the first approach has the disadvantage that it is difficult to obtain good statistics , as one has always a very special distribution with a distinct wavelength , whereas the turbulence could act on all scales .",
    "therefore we use the latter possibility and search for an equilibrium solution where we can achieve much better statistics .",
    "we force an equilibrium solution with a non - zero dust density gradient by exposing the grains to an external force field @xmath30 . depending on its specific form , this force field will eventually result in an equilibrium where the pile - up of dust grains imposed by @xmath30 is balanced completely by mass diffusion in the opposite direction . by comparing the analytical expression for the equilibrium dust number density ,",
    "whose only free parameter is @xmath66 , to the equilibrium density obtained when the turbulence is resolved in computer simulations , we can derive the turbulent diffusion coefficient .",
    "we will often refer to the external force field simply as gravity because of the qualitative similarities to real gravity .",
    "first the diffusion in the @xmath8-direction is considered . here",
    "we define a vertical gravity field @xmath68 where @xmath69 in order to have periodic boundaries in the vertical direction . here",
    "@xmath70 is the vertical extent of the box , and @xmath8 is defined to lie in the interval between @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "using periodic boundary conditions demands that we use a periodic force field in order to have a periodic equilibrium solution .",
    "the gravity field defined in equation ( [ eq : gz ] ) is linear around the mid - plane , as the gravity field normally considered for thin discs also is , but away from the mid - plane it becomes zero again on the top and bottom boundaries of the box .",
    "such a force gives a periodic dust distribution to determine the turbulent viscosity coefficient from ( we will show below that the equilibrium logarithmic dust density becomes cosinusoidal with @xmath8 ) .",

    "this allows us to conclude that the large fluctuations in dust - to - gas ratio for the intermediate friction time runs is caused by trapping in turbulent eddies .",
    "curiously there is also a significant correlation between any non - zero toroidal vorticity component @xmath188 and a low dust - to - gas ratio for the intermediate friction time run in fig .",
    "[ fig : epsd_vs_misc ] .",
    "this may be related to dust grains being expelled from eddies with a rotation axis parallel to the mid - plane ( in the absence of gravity ; when vertical gravity is included , particles can become suspended in such eddies , see @xcite ) . however , there is no similar correlation with the radial component of vorticity @xmath189 , probably because the shear wipes out any depletions / concentrations on a very short timescale .",
    "a similar search for concentrations of dust grains in mri turbulence was performed by @xcite .",
    "they find that for a frozen gas velocity field , intermediate friction time dust grains do indeed concentrate in the turbulent gas structures , but they attribute this effect to dust grains concentrating where the gas velocity field is converging rather than to vortex trapping .",
    "for an evolving gas velocity field , they find no concentration of dust .",
    "it is not clear why our results differ from these results .",
    "however , @xcite focus on concentrations of dust particles in the vertical plane , while in the current work dust concentrations are most pronounced in rotating structures in the horizontal plane .",
    "the transport properties of dust grains in a turbulent accretion disc is of interest for many aspects of protoplanetary disc modeling and planet formation scenarios . in this paper , we have measured the turbulent diffusion coefficient of dust grains embedded in ideal mhd magnetorotational turbulence directly from numerical simulations .",
    "the choice of magnetorotational turbulence was made because there is a growing realization that the magnetorotational instability can work at least in some parts of protoplanetary discs , even where the ionization fraction may be surprisingly low .",
    "it is also routinely produced in shearing box simulations , so it is a very accessible form of turbulence .",
    "thus , by the use of mri , we have a natural source of turbulence , whereas the current only other alternative for similar studies would be the use of driven turbulence in a box .",
    "the use of the ideal mhd equations can only be justified as a first approach to calculate the turbulent transport properties of dust grains .",
    "further studies of non - ideal mhd should be made to clarify the transport properties of grains deeply embedded in the disc where the ionization fraction is low and where one is confronted with a `` dead zone '' around the mid - plane of the disc .    as a numerical solver we have used the pencil code .",
    "this finite difference code solves the non - conservative form of the dynamical equations .",
    "it is special compared to other codes in that it uses sixth order derivatives in space .",
    "the numerical scheme of the pencil code was stabilized using hyperdiffusivity terms in all the dynamical equations .",
    "the effect of hyperdiffusivity is to affect the large scale motion as little as possible , while at the same time quenching unstable modes at the smallest scales of the box . by varying the size of the artificial diffusion coefficient",
    ", we have found the direct influence of artificial diffusion on the measured turbulent diffusion coefficient to be negligible , most likely due to the fact that mass diffusion is primarily contributed by the fast and far moving large scales of the turbulence , and these are as mentioned affected only very little by hyperdiffusivity . from this perspective",
    ", hyperdiffusivity seems to be a tool that is well suited for measurements of turbulent transport properties .",
    "since we have only considered dust grains of sizes much less than one meter , the dust grains could be treated as a fluid interacting with the gas through a drag force . for the tiniest dust grains , where the friction time is much shorter than the computational time - step , we have used an algebraic equation to obtain the dust velocity at each time - step .",
    "this short friction time approximation incorporates the tendency of dust grains to move up the local pressure gradient of the gas , an effect which we have referred to as pressure gradient trapping .",
    "it can explain such phenomena as the settling of dust grains towards the mid - plane of a stratified disc and the radial drift of dust grains in discs with a radial pressure gradient .",
    "in the current work , we have also included the effects of magnetic pressure and tension in the short friction time approximation . for intermediate friction time dust grains , where the friction time is within a few orders of magnitude of the orbital period , we have integrated the dust equation of motion together with the other dynamical equations . here",
    "acceleration effects are allowed , in the sense that dust grains are no longer assumed to instantaneously reach a terminal velocity where the drag force is balanced by the other forces affecting the dust .",
    "the fact that the time average of the measured diffusion coefficient was approximately the same for tiny dust grains , using the short friction time approximation , and intermediate size dust grains , with a free evolution of the dust velocity , gives some credit to the validity of the short friction time approximation .",
    "we have chosen to measure the turbulent diffusion coefficient by forcing the dust grains to settle towards a mid - plane by an external force field .",
    "this settling was eventually balanced by turbulent diffusion away from the mid - plane . to deduce the value of the turbulent diffusion coefficient , the equilibrium dust density",
    "could then be compared with an analytical solution for a parametrized diffusion coefficient .",
    "the method works not only for the vertical direction , but also for the radial direction , so that we have been able to measure both the vertical and the radial turbulent diffusion coefficients .    for the short friction time",
    "runs , the equilibrium dust number density was excellently fitted with the expected analytical solution .",
    "that means that the turbulent transport of small dust grains is well - described as diffusion . for intermediate friction times , the equilibrium dust number density was much more erratic , especially in the radial direction , and did not always give a good fit .",
    "we also found that the dust - to - gas ratio probability distribution was much wider than in the short friction time runs . to explore the reason for the large spread in dust - to - gas ratio",
    ", we have examined correlations between different parameters of the gas and the dust - to - gas ratio . a strong correlation between vertical vorticity component and dust - to - gas ratio",
    "was found .",
    "based on this and an equally strong correlation between the sign of the vortex parameter and the dust - to - gas ratio , we conclude that the spread in dust - to - gas ratio , and thus the fluctuations in the diffusion coefficient , is due to vortex trapping in turbulent eddies @xcite .",
    "some weaker indications that pressure gradient trapping is taking place were also found , but similar to the results of @xcite , the over all dominant trapping mechanism is found to be vortex trapping .",
    "the dust - trapping that is seen in the current work happens for relatively well - coupled particles with a friction time on the order of a few percent times the shear time @xmath190 .",
    "one can speculate that for larger particles , dust - trapping mechanisms will be so efficient that the diffusion picture of turbulent transport will no longer be valid , but further investigations into the transport of larger particles will have to examine this .",
    "such an investigation would have to incorporate dust grains as particles moving on top of the gas fluid , since the fluid description of dust grains is no longer valid when the mean free path becomes larger than the scale height of the disc .    in the vertical direction",
    "the turbulent diffusion coefficient was measured to be smaller than the total turbulent viscosity and have a diffusion prandtl number of approximately @xmath191 .",
    "the diffusion coefficient is still considerably larger than the non - magnetic turbulent viscosity alone .",
    "the measured radial turbulent diffusion coefficient turned out to be almost twice as large as the vertical diffusion coefficient .",
    "it is systematically larger than the total turbulent viscosity , i.e.  the sum of the non - magnetic and the magnetic turbulent viscosity , with a diffusion prandtl number of around @xmath192 .",
    "the value of the radial diffusion prandtl number was found to be falling with increasing resolution .",
    "future simulations should try to find convergence for the diffusion prandtl numbers , but this is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "the anisotropy between the vertical and the radial directions should be taken into account for studies of planetesimal formation which invoke a gravitational instability in the dust sublayer . here",
    "the onset of a gravitational instability in the vertically settled dust layer depends strongly on the effect of vertical diffusion .",
    "the amount of anisotropy can be expected to increase if the effect of vertical gravity and stratification is included ( s. fromang , personal communication ) , since then the buoyancy of the gas would decrease the vertical velocity fluctuations .",
    "we want to stress that even though we find a radial diffusion prandtl number of less than unity , the disc can still be assumed to radially transport dust grains and angular momentum about equally well .",
    "this is important for the modeling of radial mixing of dust grains and chemical species , a task which is becoming ever more relevant as more observations of the radial distribution of dust grains and molecules in protoplanetary discs become available .",
    "the result is in agreement with @xcite , who find for simulations of forced mhd turbulence a turbulent magnetic prandtl number of unity . for dust grains ,",
    "the equality between the radial turbulent diffusion coefficient and the turbulent viscosity is surprising , when considering that most of the angular momentum is transported by magnetic maxwell stresses , while the dust grains have no coupling with magnetic fields at all .",
    "following the argument of @xcite , both angular momentum transport by reynolds stresses and radial diffusion depend on the radial velocity fluctuations , so one would expect the non - magnetic @xmath4-value and the diffusion coefficient to be similar .",
    "the actual cause of the measured mismatch between turbulent diffusion and non - magnetic turbulent viscosity would seem to need more discussion in the future .",

    "in this appendix we discuss the use of hyperdiffusivity and present the hyperversions of viscosity , mass diffusion and resistivity that we are applying in this work .    because the pencil code is a finite - difference code , artificial diffusivity terms are needed in all dynamical equations to stabilize the numerical scheme . for this purpose ,",
    "we use sixth order hyperdiffusivity terms which affect mainly high wave numbers , the smallest scales in the simulation , and preserve the energy at low wave numbers .",
    "hyperviscosity and magnetic hyperdiffusivity have been used extensively to study the properties of forced magnetohydrodynamical turbulence ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the prospect is to affect large scales as little as possible by dissipation , thus widening the inertial range beyond what can be achieved with a regular viscosity operator .",
    "possible side effects of using hyperviscosity and magnetic hyperdiffusivity is to increase the bottleneck effect ( a physical effect in turbulence where energy piles up around the dissipative scale , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and to cause the dynamo - generated magnetic field in helical flows to saturate at a higher level than what is seen when using a regular viscosity operator @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , for forced non - magnetic turbulence @xcite show that the shape of the inertial range for runs with hyperviscosity is very similar to the shape for higher resolution runs without hyperviscosity .",

    "as for viscosity and diffusion we use a hyperresistivity scheme with @xmath202 in equation ( [ eq : fresm ] ) . then the resistivity function @xmath28 comes out as @xmath210 using this function as a resistivity term in the induction equation conserves all components of the magnetic field @xmath211 .",
    "in this appendix we derive the equilibrium dust density when the dust is exposed to a radial gravity . we define a sinusoidal gravity field similar to what was done in the @xmath8-direction as @xmath212 where @xmath213 is the radial wave number of the field . in the horizontal plane",
    "the coriolis force connects the radial and toroidal motions , so that any velocity in one direction results in an acceleration in the other direction .",
    "if not for the damping effect of friction , dust grains starting with any non - zero velocity would be forced to move in epicyclic motion .",
    "fortunately the drag force from the gas permits an equilibrium solution to the dust equation of motion equation ( [ eq : dustmomentumeq ] ) .",
    "we solve for @xmath214 , @xmath215 and @xmath216 and get the two component equations of the equation of motion @xmath217 again the advection is ignored .",
