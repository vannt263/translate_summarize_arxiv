    "inflation is an important branch of cosmology which can successfully solve the problems such as the horizon , the flatness and the monopole @xcite .",

    "till now there are two kinds of inflationary theory - the standard inflation and the warm inflation .",
    "the warm inflation was first proposed by berera etc in 1995 @xcite , and then we often call the standard inflation that was first proposed in 1981 @xcite as the cold inflation . the warm inflation inherits the advantages of the standard inflation such as solving horizon , flatness and monopole problems and generate nearly scale - invariant power spectrum , but also has some improvements and distinctions .",
    "a most important distinction is the origin of the density fluctuations .",
    "the perturbations naturally arise from the vacuum quantum fluctuations in standard inflation @xcite or the thermal fluctuations in warm inflation @xcite .",
    "the warm inflation can cure the `` @xmath2 '' problem @xcite and the problem of overlarge amplitude of the inflaton suffered in some standard inflationary models @xcite .",
    "in addition , the slow roll approximation can much easily to be satisfied in warm inflation thanks to the thermal damped effect @xcite .",
    "the warm inflation has developed significantly in the past twenty years and broad the scope of inflationary theory . in recent years",
    ", many works concentrate on the first principle realization of the warm inflation @xcite , the thermal fluctuations of warm inflation @xcite , the dissipation coefficient in different cases @xcite , and the consistency issue of warm inflation @xcite .",
    "what s more , some models that were excluded by planck observations @xcite in standard inflation can again be in very good agreement with the planck results in warm inflationary scenario .",
    "one representative example is the quartic chaotic potential model @xcite , which we ll discuss in detail hereinafter .    in the study of inflation ,",
    "one typically calculates the power spectrum of scalar perturbations and the amplitude of gravitational waves .",
    "this information is very important , however , it contains only two - point correlation statistics information and therefore is too limited to discriminate among a large range of inflationary models .",
    "this is the degeneracy problem ( i.e. , a single set of observables maps to a range of different inflation models)@xcite in inflation theory .",
    "even a precise measurement of the spectral index , the running of spectral index , and the detection of gravitational wave will not allow us efficiently discriminate among them . as a result , there has been growing interest in calculating higher - order correlation functions .",
    "if a perturbation quantity is exact gaussian distributed , the two - point correlation function or its fourier transform , the power spectrum is all that is needed in order to completely characterize it from a statistical point of view @xcite .",
    "so the three - point function , or its fourier transform , the bispectrum represents the lowest order statistics able to distinguish non - gaussian from gaussian perturbations @xcite . in this paper",
    "we only concentrate on the lowest order non - gaussianity .",
    "the primordial curvature perturbation in slow - roll inflationary scenario is dominated by the gaussian term .",
    "many works has been concentrated on the issue of the non - gaussianity in standard inflation in both canonical inflationary theory @xcite and noncanonical theory @xcite .",
    "the single canonical slow - roll inflationary model itself produces negligible non - gaussianity , but the non - gaussianity can be significant in noncanonical or multi - field inflationary models . in recent years , the non - gaussianity generated in both strong and weak warm inflationary models was performed in many works such as refs.@xcite .",
    "the non - gaussianity in noncanonical warm inflation was considered in @xcite and find that small sound speed and large dissipation strength can both enhance the magnitude of the non - gaussianity .",

    "we try to take this formalism to calculate the primordial non - gaussianity generated in warm inflation .",
    "the calculations about non - gaussianity in kinds of models are almost in the context of the first - order cosmological perturbation theory , and the analysis of the second - order cosmological perturbation theory is really complicated .",
    "calculations about the second - order perturbation theory were done in some works @xcite and yield a model - independent second - order result @xmath3 .",

    "an important parameter in warm inflationary theory is the dissipation strength , which describes the efficiency of warm inflation and is defined as @xmath21 where @xmath22 corresponds to a strong regime of warm inflation and @xmath23 corresponds to a weak regime of warm inflation .",
