    "<S> when the lattice size is commensurate with @xmath0 , the color - entangled states are the generalization of the usual halperin states to color - dependent twisted boundaries . </S>",
    "<S> more generally , the lattice setup opens up access to the color - entangled , unphysical sectors of a multicomponent fqh system in a physical way . </S>",
    "<S> our new formalism can be applied to the nass states , and can be used to extract the exclusion principle for the counting of low - lying levels in the energy and the entanglement spectra .    we wish to thank f.d.m .  </S>",
