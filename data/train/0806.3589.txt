    "the chern - simons class @xcite of a closed @xmath2-manifold @xmath3 , considered as foliated by its points , is the most well - known of the secondary classes for riemannian foliations .",

    "it is known that all of these classes can be realized independently for explicit examples ( theorem  [ thm - injectall ] ) , but there remain a number of open problems to study .",

    "there are a large variety of examples of riemannian foliations which arise naturally in geometry . given a smooth fibration @xmath19 , the connected components of the fibers of @xmath20 define the leaves of a foliation @xmath5 of @xmath3 .",

    "the secondary characteristic classes of riemannian foliations give another approach , independent of the molino results , for a broad classification of riemannian foliations .",
    "while the secondary classes do not provide as precise a classification scheme as the molino theory , their study focuses attention on various classes of riemannian foliations , which can then be investigated in terms of known examples , their molino structure theory , and the values of their characteristic classes , often leading to new insights .",
    "the characteristic classes of a riemannian foliation are divided into three types : the primary classes , given by the ring generated by the euler and pontrjagin classes ; the secondary classes ; and the blend of these two as defined by the cheeger - simons differential characters .",
    "each of these types of invariants have been more or less extensively studied , and part of the goal of this paper is to survey many of the known results .",
    "the paper also includes various new results and unpublished observations , some of which were presented in the author s talk @xcite . in a subsequent work @xcite",
