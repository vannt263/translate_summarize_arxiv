    "in a previous work it was argued@xcite that with maximal vacuum mixing there is agreement , with minor modifications , between extant observations of solar neutrinos and predictions by the standard solar model ( ssm)@xcite . the maximal vacuum mixing case considered was that in which the phase of neutrino oscillations coming from the sun is averaged , leading to @xmath4 of the neutrinos arriving at the earth as electron neutrinos . as a result of this averaging , while @xmath5 was assumed to be maximal ( equal to one ) , @xmath1 was not determined and taken to lie in the approximate range @xmath6 with an exclusion of the approximate range @xmath7 for maximal mixing@xcite due to the lack of an observed day - night effect in the superkamiokande data@xcite .    on the other hand , the recent first results of the sno measurement of charged current interactions produced by @xmath8b neutrinos@xcite , taken in combination with the elastic scattering result of the super - kamiokande collaboration@xcite , indicate that only about one third of the neutrinos arriving at the earth from the sun are electron neutrinos , with the other two thirds being @xmath9 or @xmath10 neutrinos .",
    "oscillation into sterile neutrinos now seems relatively unlikely from the sno result .",
    "while at first glance this comparison seems to make maximal vacuum mixing less likely , a global analysis of the sno result with the other solar neutrino experiments , chlorine@xcite , super - kamiokande@xcite , and gallium@xcite has led to the conclusion that `` the cc measurement by sno has not changed qualitatively the globally allowed solution space for solar neutrinos , although the cc measurement has provided dramatic and convincing evidence for neutrino oscillations and has strenghened the ths case for active oscillations with large mixing angles@xcite . ''",
    "furthermore , global analyses@xcite@xcite do not completely exclude solutions to the solar neutrino problem in the mass region @xmath11 for maximal ( or near maximal ) mixing . in the following",
    ", the time varying phase of oscillating @xmath0be neutrinos is investigated as a possible method to discover ( or exclude ) a solution of the solar neutrino problem in that mass region .    in the mass region @xmath12",
    "there are so - called `` just - so '' vacuum solutions of the solar neutrino problem , where the phase of the oscillation of @xmath8b neutrinos coming from the sun is not completely averaged@xcite .",
    "recall also@xcite , that there is a large change in the @xmath0be electron neutrino flux over the year in the @xmath8b `` just - so '' region due to the change in phase of order @xmath13 in a year brought about by the @xmath14 yearly orbital variation from the mean distance of the sun to the earth .",
    "as will be shown in the following , when phase averaging due to the temperature of the sun and phase damping due to the msw effect are considered , it turns out that phase variation in @xmath0be neutrinos should be observable for @xmath1 in the range from about @xmath15 up to about @xmath16 ( ev)@xmath3 . this observable range of @xmath1 via @xmath0be neutrinos turns out to be in approximate agreement with a previous analysis by de  gouva , friedland , and murayama@xcite .",
    "there is a low energy region of solar neutrinos dominated by the nearly monenergetic 862 kev line from electron capture by @xmath0be in the sun .",
    "it is the purpose of the borexino@xcite experiment , soon to come on line , to measure these neutrinos in real time .",
    "feasability studies are also being carried out for other experiments to measure @xmath0be neutrinos in real time such as lens@xcite and hellaz@xcite .",
    "if the @xmath0be neutrinos were truly monoenergetic then the number of neutrinos detected via electron scattering in an experiment like borexino ( normalized to unity for no oscillations ) would take the following form for vacuum oscillations @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the vacuum mixing angle , @xmath1 is expressed in ( ev)@xmath3 , the @xmath9 or @xmath10 neutrino scattering relative to electron neutrino scattering at 0.862 mev is 0.21@xcite , and @xmath19 the distance from the earth to the center of the sun ( in km . ) , which varies through the year due to the eccentricity @xmath20 of the earth s orbit about the sun . note",
    "that since we take the number of neutrinos detected as a function of @xmath21 , the phase of the earth in its orbit about the sun , rather than of the time of the year there is no @xmath22 seasonal variation in @xmath23 ; it is canceled by the jacobian in going from time as an independent variable to @xmath21 as an independent variable ( kepler s second law ) .",
    "it has been pointed out by pakvasa and pantaleone@xcite that the @xmath0be energy line is thermally broadened not only by the spread in nuclear velocities ( doppler broadening ) but also by the solar temperature of the approximately 80% of the capture electrons that come from the continuum .",
    "we makes use of the published table of bahcall @xcite which was obtained by convoluting both these sources of thermal spreading to obtain the energy profile of the 862 kev @xmath0be solar neutrino shown in figure 1 .",
    "note that the distribution @xmath24 is asymmetric in shape and plotted as a function of @xmath25 in mev .",
    "expressing @xmath1 in @xmath26 one obtains @xmath27 or @xmath28.\\ ] ] for clarity and convenience we will retain these constants explicitly and express @xmath1 in units of @xmath26 unless otherwise specified for the rest of this paper .",
    "since @xmath29 is constrained to contribute to eq.(9 ) only when it is much smaller than unity , one may set @xmath30 equal to @xmath31 and carry out the integration to obtain @xmath32,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath33    in additon to temperature damping of the the oscillations there is a second factor that we may call `` msw damping '' . with",
    "maximal mixing , the phase averaged rate of electron neutrinos does not depend on whether an msw transition has taken place .",
    "however , if an msw transition has taken place in the sun , then the maximally mixed neutrino emerges in the form of a pure mass eigenstate ( i.e. @xmath34 in eq.(a5 ) of appendix a ) . although the pure mass eigenstate @xmath35 is half electron neutrino and half other flavor neutrino , there is no interference from eq.(a5 ) and thus no oscillation .",
    "the probability of remaining an electron neutrino remains one half without variation in the vacuum from the sun to the earth .",
    "in contrast , pure vacuum oscillations with maximal mixing ( no msw transition ) leads to equal parts of each mass eigenstate ; the neutrinos oscillate from pure electron neutrino to pure other flavor neutrino on the path from sun to earth .",
    "however the phase averaged probability of an electon neutrino reaching the earth is still one half .",
    "guth , randall , and serna@xcite have pointed out the relevance of this difference for matter oscillations in the earth : there can be a day - night effect , even for the case of maximal mixing if there has been an msw transition in the sun . appendix a comprises a short digression on this point .",
    "the treatment in appendix a assumes phase averaging over the distances involved , due to the larger @xmath1 values that would come into play in a possible day night effect .",
    "here we are interested in the phase of the vacuum oscillation , since that is our signal .",
    "the onset of msw conversion in the sun with larger @xmath1 can be investigated numerically by utilizing a piece of computer code adapted from a previous investigation@xcite .",
    "the rate of @xmath0be electron neutrinos emerging from the sun ( again normalized to unity for no oscillations ) takes the form @xmath36 with @xmath37 the distance from the surface of the sun plus some constant . for maximal",
    "mixing : @xmath38 , and @xmath39 is 0.5 for vacuum oscillations but @xmath39 vanishes for complete adiabatic conversion .",
    "the top panel in figure 2 shows how the magnitude of the oscillation for maximum mixing is reduced with increasing @xmath1 even though the phase averaged mixing remains a constant .",
    "the filled circles are the values of 2@xmath39 calculated numerically for @xmath40 .",
    "the solid line through these circles approximates 2@xmath39 by @xmath41 $ ] . except for the small oscillations beyond @xmath42",
    ", this `` msw damping '' is well represented by the gaussian factor .",
    "the solid line at .5 represents @xmath43 for maximal mixing .",
    "the dotted lines are the corresponding quantities 2@xmath39 and @xmath43 for @xmath44 , just for comparison .",
    "incorporating `` msw damping '' eq.(6 ) then becomes @xmath45.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is the expression that we use in the calculations to follow .",
    "( 8) may also be written in the form @xmath46,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 and @xmath48 for the purpose of illustration we ignore the @xmath49 dependence in the temperature damping factor and consider @xmath50 .",
    "the bottom panel of figure 2 shows @xmath50 as the short - dashed line and repeats the gaussian msw damping factor from the above panel as the long - dashed line .",
    "the solid line is the product of the two , the overall damping factor including temperature spreading and msw damping .",
    "it is clear that there is a complete damping out of the oscillations at @xmath51 ( ev)@xmath3 , and that this broadening averages out the phase of the oscillations at higher values of @xmath1 .",
    "finally one should note that the source broadening is insignificant because of the following .",
    "it turns out that the ssm density@xcite of @xmath0be neutrinos produced as a function of the solar radius is very close to a gaussian function of the sun s radius , @xmath52 where @xmath53 , and @xmath54 is the distance from the center of the sun in units of the distance from the earth to the sun .",
    "however , as has been pointed out@xcite , the oscillations effectively start not at the source but at the level crossing point . for the present maximal mixing case",
    "the level crossing point is at surface of the sun .",
    "the neutrinos originating off the sun s axis in the direction of the earth will have a slightly larger distance to travel due to the curvature of the sun s surface . the gaussian density eq.(12 )",
    "leads , in a very good approximation , to a source spreading density of the form @xmath55 where @xmath56 or twice @xmath57 times the ratio of the sun s radius to the mean earth - sun distance , and @xmath58 is the distance from the point on the sun s surface closest to the earth toward its center .",
    "if this small source broadening were the only cause of damping , then by an analytical treatment paralleling that leading to eq.(9 ) , one would find a source damping factor @xmath59 the long and short dashed line in the bottom panel of fig.(2 ) represents @xmath60 .",
    "obviously @xmath60 only starts to deviate from unity at the rightmost part of the plot ( at @xmath61 ) .",
    "thus , source broadening is insignificant for our region of interest .",
    "the region that we will investigate spans the range from @xmath62 , the `` just so '' region for @xmath8b , up to @xmath51 , where the broadening averages the phase .",
    "as noted above and in appendix a , one might in principle begin to see a day - night effect@xcite with the onset of msw damping .",
    "in fact there would be a sizable day - night effect for maximal mixing at @xmath63@xcite ( the so called `` low '' msw solution ) .",
    "figure 3 shows @xmath64 for maximal mixing @xmath40 beginning at the low end with @xmath1 = 0.01 ( again in units of @xmath26 ) .",
    "note from eq.(8 ) that the overall phase of the cosine factor depends on @xmath1 and that this phase changes by @xmath65 when @xmath1 changes by @xmath66 .",
    "this phase sensitivity is illustrated figure 3 where for each panel in addition to the curve for the labeled value of @xmath1 there are also curves for that value plus the appropriate increments to shift the overall phase by @xmath67 , @xmath65 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 .",
    "figure  4 shows the increasing frequency of the oscillations of @xmath64 as a function of @xmath21 for the @xmath1 region of @xmath70 to @xmath71 .",
    "note also the decreasing amplitude of the oscillations as they come close to being damped out by the temperature plus source broadening and msw damping at @xmath72 .",
    "with such a rapid oscillation period throughout the year seen especially in figure 4 ( on the order of several months to several days ) , one anticipates that for such values of @xmath1 there would be insufficient statistics at an experiment like borexino for a pattern to be obvious .",
    "however , in what follows we will investigate how a fourier type analysis of data from such experiments could give evidence of a phased oscillation and thereby determine the value of @xmath1 if it lies in this range .",
    "fourier analyses of @xmath0be solar neutrino data have been previously proposed@xcite , but what follows here is a somewhat different approach .",
    "since borexino is a detector rather than radiochemical experiment , it records the information on when each count was recorded and thereby the distance of the detector to the sun @xmath73 incorporated as @xmath21 in eq.(8 ) .",
    "we suggest analyzing data from such experiments by effectively integrating data with a factor @xmath74}$ ] and varying @xmath75 over the range @xmath76 to look for a signal .",
    "to test whether the @xmath1 can be determined by such a method , monte carlo data sets have been simulated in the following way .",
    "random numbers are generated uniformly for @xmath21 from 0 to @xmath77 in order to cover the year and make use of eq.(8 ) . in order to weight events according to what would be expected from eq.(8 ) with a specific @xmath1 , a second random number between 0 and 1",
    "is then generated for each @xmath21 and a count is generated if the random number is less than @xmath64 .",
    "this is the data set : the collection of specific angles , @xmath78 , at which single events are recorded durin a year .",
    "figure 5 shows a sample analysis of a data set generated from 15000 monte carlo attempts for @xmath79 in our units .",
    "the top panel shows the expected oscillation pattern , @xmath80 . from eq.(8 ) one would expect about 9075 data points to lie below the curve from 15000 random attempts , and in fact a set of 8993 data points @xmath78 were generated in this sample .",
    "the number of data points in this sample corresponds roughly to a year s running time at borexino .",
    "for analysis one might first consider a fourier type transformation on the set @xmath78 @xmath81 the solid curve in the middle panel displays @xmath82 and it shows a discontinuity in pattern near @xmath83 .",
    "if there were no phase oscillation then one would expect @xmath84 to approach a function that we will call @xmath85 @xmath86 the dotted line in the middle panel displays @xmath87 .",
    "this suggests that we subtract off the bessel function like behavior @xmath85 contained in @xmath88 ( which tends to obscure the signal ) , create a new function @xmath89 and use @xmath90 to analyze our data set @xmath78 .",
    "@xmath91 is displayed in the bottom panel .",
    "the signal of @xmath79 is unambiguous .",
    "figure 6 shows that an unabiguous signal would be obtained with about one year s borexino statistics for @xmath1 in the range 0.10.5 . for @xmath92",
    "there is a signal at @xmath93 that might be a little ambiguous with only one year s statistics , but it retains its shape with increasing statistics ; a secondary peak seen at about @xmath94 with one year s statistics goes away with the higher statistics .",
    "there is no signal apparent for the @xmath95 case , as one would expect from looking at the corresponding curve in figure 4 .",
    "figure 7 shows the extraction of the signal for @xmath1 an order of magnitude lower .",
    "curves correspond to values in figure 3 .",
    "below @xmath96 this particular analysis starts to become ambiguous .",
    "however the slow rate of variation with @xmath21 makes direct comparison with the patterns seen in figure 3 practical . at @xmath97",
    "the analysis is complicated by the large change in magnitude of the rate throughout the year with a small increment in the value of @xmath1 .",
    "based on the sno result it now seem likely that the solar neutrino puzzle has been solved .",
    "it is not a deficiency in the standard solar model that is being observed but new physics .",
    "electron neutrinos are oscillating into some combination of @xmath9 and @xmath10 neutrinos .",
    "exactly how this happens is perhaps not yet clear , whether by one of the msw solutions or some vacuum mixing solution . in the previous sections of this paper it has been shown that if the solution to the solar neutrino puzzle happens to be maximal mixing in the mass range @xmath98(ev)@xmath3 , then a proper analysis of a successful @xmath0be neutrino experiment should be able to unambiguously determine @xmath1 .",
    "not seeing a @xmath1 signal in this mass range would elimate a region of @xmath1 for large mixing angle .",
    "i would like to thank chellis chasman for reading and commenting on the manuscript .",
    "this manuscript has been authored under contract no .",
    "de - ac02 - 98ch10886 with the u. s. department of energy .",
    "guth , randall , and serna@xcite have pointed out that there can be a day - night effect , even for the case of maximal mixing .",
    "what follows is a compact explication of this point with emphasis on the limits of no msw and maximal msw effect in the sun .    the general form for two mass eigenstates in two neutrino mixing is @xmath99 and @xmath100 where @xmath101 is presumed to be some linear combination of @xmath102 and @xmath103 . conversely @xmath104 and @xmath105 in free space mass eigenstates propagate independently .",
    "a mixed mass state @xmath106 then has the form @xmath107 the probability @xmath108 that a neutrino born in the sun is an electron neutrino when it reaches the earth is then @xmath109 with @xmath110 the average probability of a mass one or mass two eigenstate arriving at the earth where the phase has been averaged by the distances involved . since @xmath111 this",
    "may also be written equivalently @xmath112 the probability @xmath113 that an electron neutrino born in the sun will be an electron neutino after passing through the sun , traveling to the earth , and then passing through the earth is simply @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the probability that a mass 2 neutrino entering the earth emerges at the detector as an electron neutrino . making use of eq.(a7 )",
    "this becomes @xmath116 this expression is the mikeyev - smirnov expression@xcite for the day night effect , trivially transformed@xcite to be most transparent in various limits .",
