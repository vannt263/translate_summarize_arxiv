    "in the raman spectra of a single wall carbon nanotube ( swnt ) , the two in - plane optical phonon modes , that is , the longitudinal optic ( lo ) and transverse optic ( to ) phonon modes at the @xmath0 point in the two - dimensional brillouin zone ( 2d bz ) , which are degenerate in graphite and graphene , split into two peaks , @xmath1 and @xmath2 peaks , respectively .",
    "@xcite the splitting of the two peaks for swnts is inversely proportional to the square of the diameter @xmath3 of swnts due to the curvature effect , in which @xmath1 does not change with changing @xmath3 , but the @xmath2 frequency decreases with decreasing @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite in particular , for metallic swnts , the @xmath2 peaks appear at a lower frequency than the @xmath2 peaks for semiconducting swnts with a similar diameter .",
    "@xcite the spectra of @xmath2 for metallic swnts show a much larger spectral width than that for semiconducting swnts .",
    "further , the spectral @xmath2 feature shows an asymmetric lineshape as a function of frequency which is known as the breit - wigner - fano ( bwf ) lineshape .",
    "@xcite the origin of the bwf lineshape is considered to be due to the interaction of discrete phonon states with continuous free electron states .",
    "it has been widely accepted that the frequency shift of the @xmath4-band is produced by the electron - phonon ( el - ph ) interaction .",
    "@xcite an optical phonon changes into an electron - hole pair as an intermediate state by the el - ph interaction .",
    "this process gives the phonon a self - energy .",

    "@xcite in this case the frequency shifted spectra show that not only the lo mode but also the to mode are shifted in the same fashion by a dopant . for a graphene monolayer , lazzeri _ et al .",

    "@xcite    in this paper , we show that the @xmath0 point to phonon mode becomes hard when @xmath7 and has a considerable broadening for metallic zigzag nanotubes .",
    "the occurrence of the phonon hardening for the to mode is due to the curvature effect , a special character of the electron - phonon coupling , and a basic consequence of second - order perturbation theory .",
    "we show using a gauge symmetry argument that the electrons completely decouple from the to mode near the @xmath0 point . besides",
    ", we show that for a chiral nanotube , both the lo and to modes are softened due to the fact that the direction of the to phonon vibration is not parallel to the nanotube circumferential direction .",
    "@xcite another interest of ours is the mixing of lo and to phonons to form degenerate phonon frequencies .",
    "when the lo phonon mode becomes soft , a crossing of the lo mode with the to mode occurs at a certain value of @xmath5 .",
    "for such a mode crossing , we should generally consider the electron - phonon coupling for degenerate phonon modes to sense the crossing or anti - crossing of the two phonon frequencies as a function of @xmath5 .",
    "we will show by an analytical calculation that there is no mixing between the lo and to phonon modes for any case due to time reversal symmetry .",

    "( [ eq : omega_2 ] ) for both to and lo modes .",
    "this explains why no @xmath4-band splitting is observed in a single layer of graphene .",
    "@xcite even when we consider the to and lo modes near the @xmath0 point , we do not expect any splitting between the lo and to phonon energies because the to mode with @xmath166 is completely decoupled from the electrons .",
    "thus , for @xmath166 , only the lo mode contributes to the @xmath4-band .    in our numerical results for @xmath47",
    ", we see a crossing between the lo and to mode at some values of @xmath5 .",
    "if there is a finite transition amplitude between the lo and to phonon modes , we need to diagonalize the following matrix according to second - order perturbation theory for a degenerate case , @xmath179 where @xmath180 is the effective hamiltonian in second - order perturbation theory given by @xmath181 using eq .",
    "( [ eq : coupling ] ) , we see that @xmath182 which is an odd function of @xmath64 appears in the numerator for the diagonal terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : d2nd ] ) .",
    "thus , the mode coupling through the electron - hole pair at @xmath64 is canceled by that at @xmath183 , i.e. , due to the time - reversal symmetry of the system .",
    "thus , even though the lo and to modes cross each other , there is no - mixing between the lo and to phonon modes for any chirality .",
    "if there is a breaking of time reversal symmetry for @xmath64 , we expect some mixing between the lo and to phonon modes .",
    "the first comparison we make is to experimental results in the literature . here",
    "we try to assign the chirality of the nanotube that is given in fig .  2 in ref .",
    "this figure shows two strong intensity peaks with different phonon frequencies .",
    "the higher frequency peak does not depend on the gate voltage and the lower frequency peak shows a frequency shift with a strong broadening near the dirac point .",
    "the existence of a flat intensity peak as a function of fermi energy for a metallic swnt indicates that the electron - phonon coupling is very weak for the phonon mode .",
    "thus , the nanotube can be thought of as an armchair swnt ( or close to an armchair swnt in the chiral angle ) since the el - ph coupling between the to mode and electron - hole pairs is negligible in this case .",
    "further investigation comparing theory with experiment is strongly necessary for tubes of different chiralities .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : jingkong - data](a ) and ( b ) , we show experimental results of the g - band intensity as a function of applied gate voltage for two different isolated swnts . for the given excitation energy of 1.91ev and the observed radial breathing mode ( rbm ) frequencies 196 and 193 @xmath184 for the sample of fig .  [",
    "fig : jingkong - data](a ) and ( b ) , respectively , we can assign @xmath158 by using the conventional assignment technique that we used for single nanotube raman spectroscopy.@xcite as a result , we assign the @xmath158 values as ( 12,6 ) for fig .  [",
    "fig : jingkong - data ] ( a ) and ( 15,3 ) , ( 16,1 ) , or ( 11,8 ) for fig .",
    "[ fig : jingkong - data](b ) .        although",
    "( 12,6 ) is not so close to the chiral angle for the armchair nanotube , we expect that figure  [ fig : jingkong - data](a ) exhibits a similar behavior to that of fig .  2 in ref .  .",
    "thus the assignment of ( 12,6 ) from the rbm spectra is consistent with the present phonon spectra . in fig .",
    "[ fig : jingkong - data](b ) , the intensity near the dirac point of the to ( lo ) mode is weaker ( stronger ) than shown in ( a ) .",
    "this indicates that the tube is not an armchair swnt but close to a metallic zigzag swnt ( or a metallic chiral swnt ) .",
    "thus we can assign this swnt either to ( 15,3 ) or to ( 16,1 ) for the swnt for fig .",
    "[ fig : jingkong - data](b ) and we can exclude @xmath185 .",
    "a further comparison with more experimental data will be required , which will be carried out in the future .",
    "a chirality dependent raman intensity was observed for metallic swnts as shown at fig .  1 in ref .  . although the @xmath5 positions for the observed metallic swnts are unclear , the results are consistent with our calculations in the following way .",
    "for example , the to mode in a @xmath186 swnt gives a sharp lineshape and the lo mode shows a broad feature for a @xmath187 swnt .",
    "it is noted that the raman intensity is proportional to the el - ph coupling for an optically excited electron via eq .",
    "( [ eq : coupling2 ] ) .",
    "since this el - ph coupling depends on the chiral angle due to the trigonal wrapping effect , one of the two optical modes may be invisible in the raman intensity .",
    "@xcite    in summary , we have calculated the @xmath5 dependence of @xmath47 ( @xmath188 and to ) for metallic carbon nanotubes .",
    "the results show a strong dependence of the phonon frequency shift on the chirality of single - walled carbon nanotubes because of the curvature - induced shift of the wavevector around the tube axis .",
    "this is explained by the general property of second - order perturbation theory and the characteristic electron - phonon coupling for the @xmath0 point lo and to phonon modes ( eqs .",
    "( [ eq : coupling ] ) and ( [ eq : h_int ] ) ) . for the lo and",
    "to phonon modes near the @xmath0 point , we showed the absence of an electron - phonon coupling for the to mode for @xmath166 due to a local gauge symmetry , and that the lo mode works as a deformation - induced magnetic field .",
    "the phonon mixing between lo and to phonon modes is absent in second - order perturbation theory due to time - reversal symmetry .",
