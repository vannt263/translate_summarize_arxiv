    "this paper studies two important bases for the @xmath0 $ ] representation of the symmetric group @xmath3the _ kazhdan  lusztig  basis _ and the _ reduced web basis_to compare their images under classical maps .",
    "kuperberg defined the combinatorial @xmath4 spider @xcite , which comes with a braiding that induces a symmetric group action on webs .",
    "the combinatorial @xmath4 spider is a diagrammatic category encoding the representation theory of @xmath5 , namely the quantum enveloping algebra of the lie algebra @xmath6 . the category comes with objects ( tensor products of the standard representation @xmath7 and the dual representation @xmath8 of the quantum group ) , morphisms ( intertwining maps ) , and a diagrammatic description of morphisms compatible with the standard skein relations of knot theory .",
    "the analogous object for @xmath9 is the @xmath10 spider or temperley - lieb category .",
    "( spiders for @xmath11 have also been constructed @xcite . ) in the classical limit , the symmetric group acts on a tensor power by exchanging factors ; this action is represented diagrammatically by twining certain strands of the web and resolving according to standard knot - theoretic relations . in this paper , as in much other combinatorial work @xcite , we focus on webs for @xmath12 .",
    "the action of the symmetric group on the kazhdan  lusztig  basis comes from a totally different context : the construction of the hecke algebra and action of the hecke algebra on itself , which specializes to an action of the symmetric group on its group algebra in the classical limit .",
    "lusztig s original work on the hecke algebra aimed to understand springer s geometric representation of the symmetric group .",
    "they described a basis they hoped was springer s basis , and in the process discovered a different , more algebraically - natural basis of the hecke algebra now called the kazhdan ",
    "lusztig  basis .",
    "the kazhdan ",
    "lusztig  basis yields _ left cell bases _ for each irreducible representation of the symmetric group under a standard process described in section [ klsection ] .",
    "a close relationship seems to exist between these kazhdan ",
    "lusztig  left cell bases and the springer basis of each irreducible symmetric group representation ( see below ) , though its exact nature is mysterious .",
    "these bases of irreducible symmetric group representations tie together numerous areas of mathematics .",
    "the kazhdan ",
    "lusztig  left cell bases have important applications to problems in combinatorics @xcite , geometry @xcite , and the theory of infinite dimensional lie algebra representations @xcite .",
    "the reduced web basis plays an important role in both category and knot theory @xcite .",
    "our work is part of a wider effort to understand these bases and their various applications .",
    "one traditional approach to studying bases is to identify equivalences by constructing isomorphisms .",
    "for instance , khovanov constructed isomorphisms sending deodhar s relative kazhdan",
    " lusztig  basis to two different bases : lusztig s canonical basis and dual canonical basis in the context of @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "khovanov defined his map algebraically , though he was inspired by diagrammatic calculations in the temperley - lieb algebra .",
    "frenkel , khovanov , and kirillov extended khovanov s result to an isomorphism mapping the relative kazhdan ",
    "lusztig  basis to lusztig s standard and dual canonical bases for all @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "another traditional approach is to compare the images of different bases under established maps .",
    "for instance , the natural restriction of the dual canonical basis to the @xmath10 spider ( discussed later in this introduction ) coincides with the reduced web basis for @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "kuperberg conjectured that in the @xmath15 case , the restriction of the dual canonical basis would agree with the reduced web basis @xcite , though this was later disproven by khovanov and kuperberg @xcite .",
    "more recently , fontaine , kamnitzer , and kuperberg identify reduced webs for @xmath4 with the components of the @xmath0 $ ] springer fiber using a map closely related to the geometric satake correspondence @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider well - known combinatorial bijections relating the index sets for different bases of @xmath3representations :    1 .   permutations naturally index the kazhdan ",
    "lusztig  basis elements ; 2 .",
    "the _ robinson  schensted _ algorithm associates permutations bijectively to pairs of standard young tableaux ; and 3 .",
    "_ khovanov ",
    "kuperberg s bijection _ identifies reduced webs for @xmath12 with standard young tableaux of shape @xmath0 $ ] .",
    "schensted s algorithm needs little introduction .",
    "decomposing the regular representation of the symmetric group @xmath16 into a sum of irreducible representations ( with multiplicity ) shows that the order of @xmath16 is equal to the number of same shape pairs of young tableaux on @xmath17 boxes .",
    "schensted makes this bijection explicit ; it is used throughout combinatorics , representation theory , and computer science @xcite .",
    "similarly , khovanov  kuperberg s bijection ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 1 ) makes explicit kuperberg s more general observation that reduced webs are equinumerous with certain dominant lattice paths @xcite ; we use petersen  pylyavskyy  rhoades s elegant description of the map , which replaces dominant lattice paths with young tableaux , together with tymoczko s description of the inverse @xcite .",
    "russell recently extended the map to a bijection in the context of arbitrary tensor products of @xmath7 and @xmath8 and semistandard young tableaux @xcite .",
    "the current paper proves two main claims in a series of results .",
    "the first is that the three bijections i  iii preserve deep structural properties , in a sense we make precise in a moment .",
    "the second is a combinatorial proof that the reduced web and kazhdan ",
    "lusztig  left cell bases of @xmath0 $ ] symmetric group representations are inequivalent in spite of their structural commonalities .    the structure that these bijections preserve",
    "is called the _",
    "generalized @xmath2-invariant_. vogan first defined generalized @xmath2-invariants in the context of @xmath18-modules @xcite . for permutations , the generalized @xmath2-invariant can be thought of intuitively as a refinement of the data of the descent set .",
    "more precisely , given information about how to construct a descent set together with a collection of functions @xmath19 that change the descent set in prescribed ways , we can follow different sequences of functions @xmath19 while retaining the information of the descents sets associated to each permutation encountered along the way .",
    "the generalized @xmath2-invariant is closely related to assaf s notion of dual equivalent graphs , wherein vertices are labeled with descent sets and an edge connects two vertices when they are linked by an @xmath19-map @xcite .",
    "we provide intrinsic definitions of the descent set in different contexts , which we call the _ @xmath2-invariant _ to emphasize our purpose .",
    "the @xmath2-invariant is the collection of simple reflections @xmath20 for which :    * * ( for a standard young tableau ) * the number @xmath21 lies on a lower row than @xmath22 ( and a special case of vogan s definition @xcite ) ; * * ( for a kazhdan  lusztig  basis element ) * the reflection @xmath20 negates the kazhdan ",
    "lusztig  basis element ; and * * ( for a reduced web ) * boundary vertices @xmath22 and @xmath21 are joined by an interior vertex .",
    "we then identify natural functions @xmath19 in each context , allowing us to recursively construct the generalized @xmath2-invariant in each case .",
    "amazingly , the @xmath2-invariant , the maps @xmath19 , and thus the generalized @xmath2-invariants commute with the natural maps described above and as shown in figure [ figure : commuting gen taus ] .",
