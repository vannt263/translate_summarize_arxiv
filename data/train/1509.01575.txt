    "a key element controlling the interaction of the solar wind with earth s magnetosphere is the nature and efficiency of the magnetic reconnection process at the dayside magnetopause . during reconnection , solar wind magnetic field lines effectively break and cross - connect with terrestrial magnetic field lines . as a consequence ,",
    "solar wind plasma is able to enter the magnetosphere and the reconnected magnetic field lines convect tailward @xcite .",
    "this is a crucial aspect of space weather phenomena .",
    "the focus of this study is how the bulk flow of the solar wind around the magnetosphere itself affects the dayside reconnection process ; we focus on ( 1 ) the convection of the reconnection site by the bulk flow , ( 2 ) the effect on the reconnection rate , and ( 3 ) the critical bulk flow speed above which reconnection is not the dominant effect .",
    "bulk flow is expected to be most important when reconnection occurs near the polar cusps .",
    "this is because the bulk magnetosheath flow around the magnetopause acquires a potentially sizable component parallel or anti - parallel to the magnetic field when the reconnection site is near the cusps .",
    "this affects the reconnection site very differently than when reconnection is near the subsolar point , where the flow is predominantly not aligned with the reconnecting magnetosheath magnetic field . as pointed out by @xcite ,",
    "magnetic reconnection is likely to occur near the polar cusps when the interplanetary magnetic field ( imf ) has a northward component .",
    "detections of high latitude reconnection are quite common @xcite .",
    "one reason the effect of the solar wind flow on reconnection is interesting is that there have been conflicting results on whether the cusp reconnection site is stationary or is convected tailward . @xcite and @xcite suggested that in order to see sunward flow from a reconnection event poleward of the cusp with a stationary x - line ( where the reconnecting magnetic field goes to zero ) , the magnetosheath flow speed should be sub - alfvnic ;",
    "if the flow is super - alfvnic , the x - line would have to convect tailward .",
    "if the magnetosheath flow is more than double the magnetosheath alfvn speed , reconnection could not occur .",
    "tailward convection of an x - line has been seen in global magnetospheric simulations using magnetohydrodynamic simulations of earth @xcite and hybrid ( kinetic ions with fluid electrons ) simulations of mercury @xcite . in the latter ,",
    "once the x - line convected far enough tailward , a new x - line formed .",
    "this behavior was identified in cluster observations @xcite . in other studies ,",
    "the stability of auroral signals associated with high - latitude reconnection suggest reconnection sites remain stationary @xcite , although there are uncertainties about whether a lack of change in auroral signatures necessarily precludes repeated x - line generation and tailward convection .",
    "it was also suggested that reconnection with magnetosheath flow speed exceeding twice the magnetosheath alfvn speed can occur because suppressing reconnection would introduce a pileup of magnetic flux that creates plasma depletion layers , which increase the local alfvn speed @xcite .",
    "another reason this topic is interesting is that a flow shear , such as that caused by the solar wind , slows down the reconnection process and can even stop it .",
    "it has been shown analytically and numerically using the magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) model for symmetric systems ( with equal and opposite reconnecting magnetic fields and the same mass density on either side of the reconnection site ) that a super - alfvnic flow shear completely suppresses reconnection , while reconnection still occurs for sub - alfvnic flow shear @xcite .",
    "when reconnection occurs with a sub - alfvnic flow shear present , there is a decrease in the reconnection rate @xcite and outflow speed @xcite .",
    "the situation is more complicated in more realistic models than mhd ; there are regimes in the hall - mhd model in which both tearing ( the linear form of reconnection ) and kelvin - helmholtz can be simultaneously linearly unstable @xcite .",
    "the suppression of reconnection by a flow shear is potentially of broader importance .",
    "it was suggested that suppression of reconnection by flow shear limits the length of the x - line ( _ i.e. , _ the separator ) at the dayside @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite pointed out reconnection suppression via flow shear is not expected to play a role for southward imf orientations because the bulk flow is oriented out of the reconnection plane ( along the flanks ) rather than parallel to the reconnecting magnetic field ( toward the poles ) , although it does locally decrease the reconnection rate when the imf is directed northward .",
    "the effect of flow shear on reconnection is also expected to be relevant at other planets . earth s solar wind - magnetospheric interaction is qualitatively different from jupiter s and saturn s , where the planet s relatively rapid rotation contributes to the global convection pattern @xcite .",
    "studies have investigated the extent that reconnection occurs at the outer planets magnetopauses and whether flow shear plays a role in preventing it @xcite .",
    "the solar wind - magnetospheric interaction at mercury is similar to earth s but on a much more rapid time scale @xcite , so flow shear may also affect reconnection at mercury .    for applications at earth s magnetosphere , it is important to note that the magnetospheric magnetic field is typically a few times stronger than the magnetosheath magnetic field and the solar wind plasma in the magnetosheath typically has a much higher density than that of the magnetosphere @xcite , _",
    "i.e. , _ the reconnection is asymmetric .",
    "consequently , it is crucial to extend studies of flow shear to asymmetric systems . there has been much work of late on asymmetric reconnection in the absence of flow shear ; we summarize only those results most germane to the present study .",
    "the rate of two - dimensional ( 2d ) asymmetric reconnection ( with anti - parallel magnetic fields ) has been studied @xcite ; it will be summarized in sec .",
    "[ section::theory ] .",
    "in addition , it was found that the x - line and the stagnation point , where the inflowing plasma bulk flow speed goes to zero , are generally not in the same location for asymmetric reconnection @xcite .",
    "we know of only a few numerical studies of the impact of flow shear on asymmetric magnetic reconnection .",
    "@xcite studied reconnection with an asymmetric density and a flow shear in fluid simulations ; they suggested that reconnection is suppressed if the flow shear exceeds the alfvn speed on either side of the layer .",
    "@xcite used kinetic particle - in - cell simulations to study reconnection with a density asymmetry , a flow shear , and a guide field ; they observed that the x - line convects in the outflow direction with contributions from both the flow shear and the diamagnetic drift @xcite .",
    "in the present study , we use theoretical and numerical techniques to study asymmetric reconnection with arbitrary upstream parallel flow speeds .",
    "we predict the bulk convection speed of an isolated x - line using a simple fluid analysis .",
    "an interesting conclusion is that the asymmetries introduce qualitative differences compared to symmetric reconnection . in particular , if the upstream flow is equal and opposite on the two sides , the x - line is stationary for symmetric reconnection but convects for asymmetric reconnection .",
    "we also predict the reconnection rate of asymmetric reconnection with upstream flow , including a condition for the critical upstream flow speed required to suppress reconnection . the critical flow shear ( half the difference of the flows on either side ) for symmetric reconnection is the alfvn speed , so one might expect the cutoff for asymmetric reconnection to be the asymmetric generalization of the alfvn speed .",
    "however , we show that the cutoff exceeds the asymmetric alfvn speed , and the cutoff speed becomes much larger than the asymmetric alfvn speed when the asymmetry is large , such as the typical conditions at earth s magnetopause .",
    "consequently , an isolated x - line at earth s polar cusps would almost never be suppressed by flow shear .",
    "we use 2d two - fluid simulations to confirm the predictions .",
    "( we point out that particle - in - cell simulations are ostensibly a better tool to test the theory because of their more accurate description of kinetic scale physics and plasma mixing in collisionless plasmas , but fluid simulations are employed here as a first step because they accurately portray the large scale physics while being less noisy and therefore easier to compare to the new theory presented here .",
    "we employ this approach because it has proven prudent for asymmetric reconnection without flow shear @xcite .",
    "important features which are present in particle - in - cell simulations but not two - fluid simulations are discussed in detail in the conclusion section . )",
    "we then show that the predictions are consistent with recent observations of a cusp reconnection event for which the magnetosheath flow exceeded twice the magnetosheath alfvn speed .",
    "the present results are in stark contrast to the previous understanding of the effect of flow shear on reconnection based on the @xcite results , as x - lines convect even for sub - alfvnic flow and reconnection occurs for magnetosheath flow speeds much greater than the magnetosheath alfvn speed .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows : section  [ section::theory ] has the derivation of an expression for the convection speed of the x - line and a prediction for the reconnection rate for asymmetric reconnection with a flow shear .",

    "section  6 summarizes the results and discusses limitations of the study .",
    "we begin by defining system variables for asymmetric reconnection with upstream flow parallel or anti - parallel to the reconnecting magnetic fields .",
    "the upstream magnetic fields above and below the dissipation region are @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which are assumed anti - parallel ( _ i.e. , _ there is no guide field ) .",
    "the magnetic fields are in opposite directions , so we will use @xmath2 and @xmath3 as the magnitudes of the fields .",
    "( their direction does not impact the present analysis as long as they are oppositely directed . )",
    "the upstream mass densities are @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and the density in the downstream region is @xmath6 .",
    "the upstream flow speeds @xmath7 and @xmath8 are defined in a stationary frame ( with the planet in question at rest or , in the case of a simulation , the rest frame of the simulation ) , where @xmath9 refers to the reconnecting magnetic field direction ( as in boundary normal coordinates ) .",
    "each speed is defined as positive if to the right and negative if to the left .",
    "the convection speed of the x - line is defined as @xmath10 .",
    "the inflow speeds ( normal to the dissipation region ) are @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the half - length and half - width of the dissipation region , respectively .",
    "it is convenient to analyze this system in the rest frame of the x - line , so we transform into the reference frame moving at a speed @xmath10 relative to the stationary reference frame .",
    "the dissipation region in this reference frame is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig::flux_diagram ] . in this frame , the upstream parallel flow speeds are given by @xmath15 and @xmath16 . the outflow speed is @xmath17 , which is expected to be the same in both outflow directions in the rest frame of the x - line .",

    "a number of potentially important effects are ignored to keep the analysis tractable ; these are discussed in sec .",
    "6 .",
    "we first consider the convection of an isolated x - line for 2d anti - parallel asymmetric reconnection with arbitrary upstream parallel flow speeds .",
    "the physical reason that the x - line can convect in the outflow direction is that the upstream plasmas carry momentum in the outflow direction ; by conservation of momentum , if the upstream plasma has a non - zero net momentum , then the dissipation region will too .",
    "this is true both for symmetric and asymmetric reconnection . for symmetric reconnection",
    ", the x - line is expected to convect at the average of the upstream flows . for asymmetric reconnection",
    ", the inflow speed is different for the two upstream sides when the system has asymmetric magnetic field strengths @xcite , so the two upstream plasmas do not contribute momentum in the outflow direction equally .",
    "consequently , as we will show , the x - line convects in the outflow direction for asymmetric reconnection even for equal and opposite upstream flow speeds .",
    "an alternate , but equivalent , interpretation is that the x - line and stagnation point are separated during asymmetric reconnection @xcite , so the side with the plasma that crosses the x - line imposes a flow in the outflow direction at the x - line , causing it to convect .    to estimate the convection speed , we use a fluid description of the plasma to find the bulk effects of the flow .",

    "conservation of magnetic flux implies @xmath30 @xcite , so solving for @xmath10 gives @xmath31 this gives the convection speed of the x - line in the outflow direction for arbitrary upstream densities , reconnecting magnetic field strengths , and parallel flow speeds .",
    "as discussed earlier , @xmath32 is non - zero for symmetric anti - parallel flow ( @xmath33 ) when the magnetic fields and/or densities are asymmetric .",
    "this shows that the x - line convects regardless of upstream flow speeds , not only for super alfvnic flow as suggested in @xcite .",
    "we consider particular limits of this expression . for any upstream conditions , if @xmath34 , then @xmath35 , as expected .",

    "( [ eqn::drift_eqn ] ) reduces to the expected result of @xmath38 the average of the two upstream flow velocities ( which is zero if the flows are equal and opposite ) .",
    "if the densities are symmetric but the magnetic fields are not , then @xmath39 and if the magnetic fields are symmetric but densities are not , we find @xmath40 these predictions are testable with simulations .",
    "we turn to the prediction of the reconnection rate of 2d asymmetric anti - parallel reconnection with arbitrary upstream parallel flow speeds .",
    "the reconnection rate @xmath41 for symmetric reconnection with an equal and opposite upstream flow was recently found to scale as @xcite @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the reconnection rate in the absence of upstream flow ( @xmath44 for collisionless reconnection ) , @xmath45 is the upstream speed of the symmetric plasma bulk flow , and @xmath46 is the outflow speed given by the alfvn speed based on the reconnecting magnetic field .",
    "physically , the form of this correction is motivated in a way similar to the suppression of reconnection by diamagnetic effects .",
    "@xcite argued that the magnetic tension force on the plasma due to a newly reconnected magnetic field line has to overcome the momentum of the moving plasma in the dissipation region .    for asymmetric reconnection",
    ", we propose that the effect is very similar .",
    "one main difference is that the outflow speed during 2d anti - parallel asymmetric reconnection becomes @xcite @xmath47 a second difference is that the x - line and stagnation point are not at the center of the dissipation region @xcite , so the upstream plasmas on the two sides contribute momentum in proportion to the relative location of the stagnation point .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig::reconnected_fieldline ] , showing a recently reconnected magnetic field line in blue with the stagnation point denoted by the `` s '' .",
    "the distance from the upstream edges to the stagnation point above and below are @xmath48 and @xmath49 , and the left side shows how the two upstream flows impact the straightening magnetic field line .",
    "thus , not only is the upstream momentum allowed to be different on the two sides because the density and flow speed can differ , but they contribute in different proportions to the dissipation region .",
    "we follow the result of eq .",
    "( a3 ) from @xcite and propose the outflow speed decreases as @xmath50 in writing this , we effectively subtract off the energy due to the flow , but here we do so in proportion to each side s contribution opposing the release of magnetic energy . using @xmath51 and @xmath52 @xcite and eliminating @xmath10 using eq .",
    "( [ eqn::drift_eqn ] ) , some algebra reveals @xmath53 note , the only upstream flow dependence is on the difference in upstream flows @xmath54 .",
    "consequently , we suggest the reconnection rate @xmath55 for asymmetric reconnection with arbitrary upstream parallel flow speeds , extending eq .",
    "( [ eqn::recon_rate_sym ] ) to asymmetric systems , scales as @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the asymmetric reconnection rate in the absence of upstream flow @xcite and @xmath58 is half the difference of the upstream flow speeds ( their average if oppositely directed ) .",
    "thus , the reconnection rate decreases with increasing flow shear .",
    "an important consequence of eq .",
    "( [ eqn::recon_rate ] ) is the prediction of a critical flow speed @xmath59 above which reconnection does not occur ( corresponding to @xmath60 ) .",
    "the prediction is that reconnection shuts off above flow shear speeds of @xmath61 in the symmetric reconnection limit , this expression reduces to @xmath62 , the known result , so it generalizes the known result to asymmetric systems .",
    "it is important to note that the fraction multiplying @xmath63 is always greater than or equal to one .",
    "this implies that the critical flow shear required to suppress asymmetric reconnection exceeds the asymmetric alfvn speed . for larger asymmetries ,",
    "the critical flow shear becomes larger .",
    "consequently , while super - alfvnic flow is sufficient to suppress symmetric reconnection , reconnection can proceed in asymmetric reconnection for super - alfvnic flow , which differs from the @xcite prediction . if the asymmetry is large ( as is typical at earth s magnetopause ) , then the suppression condition is much larger than the asymmetric alfvn speed .",

    "there is clear evidence of the early phases of a kelvin - helmholtz instability .",

    "( [ eqn::drift_eqn ] ) becomes @xmath163 thus , an isolated x - line would convect tailward at essentially the same speed as the flow in the magnetosheath , not the average flow speed as one would expect for symmetric reconnection . the physical cause for this , as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig::reconnected_fieldline ] , is that the stagnation point is far to the magnetospheric side of the dissipation region , so most of the dissipation region is populated by magnetosheath plasma and most of its momentum is contained in the magnetosheath plasma .",
    "therefore , it flows near the speed of the magnetosheath plasma .",
    "this is borne out in recent cluster observations of a tailward convecting x - line @xcite which we use as a case study . in this event at the southern hemisphere",
    "s cusp on december 27th , 2005 , cluster s c1 and c3 spacecraft witnessed reconnection signatures on a crossing from the magnetosheath to the magnetosphere .",
    "the magnetosheath had @xmath164 nt and a number density @xmath165 @xmath166 , while in the magnetosphere @xmath167 nt and @xmath168 @xmath166 . from their separation and the time delay between observed jet reversals ,",
    "the convection speed of the x - line was estimated to be @xmath169 105 km / s , while the @xmath9 component of the magnetosheath flow was estimated at @xmath170 km / s .",
    "this is consistent with eq .",
    "( [ equation::driftms ] ) .    in the past , assessing whether reconnection could occur was done by comparing the magnetosheath flow speed to the magnetosheath alfvn speed @xcite . for this event",

    "this exceeds twice the magnetosheath alfvn speed so previous models would suggest reconnection should not occur , but reconnection is observed to happen .",
    "the asymmetric alfvn speed for these parameters is 74.5 km / s , so @xmath171 53 km / s is sub - alfvnic , and",
    "the prediction here is that reconnection should occur .    for the reconnection rate , in the limit appropriate for typical conditions at the magnetopause , eq .",
    "( [ eqn::recon_rate ] ) becomes @xmath172 since @xmath159 , this implies the surprising result that the reconnection rate is not changed much by the flow shear for typical magnetospheric parameters .",
    "this is a major departure from the symmetric case where the reconnection rate falls strongly as a function of flow shear speed .",
    "physically , the cause for this is related to the stagnation point being very close to the magnetospheric side , as before . in the reference frame of the x - line ,",
    "the magnetosheath is essentially still , while the magnetosphere has a significant flow .",
    "however , since the magnetospheric density is so low , it has very little effect on the reconnection process .",
    "this is seen further by investigating the condition for suppressing reconnection . from eq .",
    "( [ eqn::reconratemsp ] ) and using @xmath173 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : vsheardef ] ) since the magnetospheric plasma is essentially stationary , the condition that reconnection is suppressed ( @xmath174 ) is @xmath175 for the example of the case study event from cluster , this implies it would take a magnetosheath flow speed of 22 times bigger than @xmath176^{1/2}$ ] for flow shear to suppress reconnection , far greater than in symmetric reconnection and the @xcite model where alfvnic flow suppresses reconnection .",
    "( we point out further that particle - in - cell simulations and observations typically find outflow speeds half of that predicted in symmetric or asymmetric reconnection theories , so the critical speed may be a factor of two smaller than this prediction . however , this does not change the result that the critical speed is much higher than the asymmetric alfvn speed and the magnetosheath alfvn speed . ) thus , for an isolated x - line with typical magnetospheric parameters , the flow shear would rarely prevent reconnection from occurring .    , with magnetic field lines overplotted in blue , for a simulation with @xmath177 with @xmath178 , which is above the predicted cutoff where reconnection is suppressed .",
    "]    while x - lines in the magnetosphere can convect as discussed earlier , it was suggested from observations @xcite that cusp reconnection can be steady for hours with a stationary x - line , though it may be difficult to be sure solely from auroral signatures .",
    "further , the distance to the x - line has been inferred from observations @xcite , and strong convection is not seen , even though eq .",
    "( [ equation::driftms ] ) would predict a large enough convection speed to be observable .",
    "this suggests that reconnection in the magnetosphere is not always consistent with isolated x - lines , which was a key assumption of the theory presented here .",
    "in particular , the theory does not take any external effect other than flow into account .",
    "a single dayside x - line is not isolated ; instead , for a single x - line during steady times to be stationary , it must balance all magnetic forces , gas pressure forces , and dynamic pressure forces from bulk flow ( of the type discussed here ) . thus , by definition , the flow effects have already been taken into account to set up a single x - line , and the present model would not apply . physically , the present model does not include magnetic fields in the cusp being line - tied to the ionosphere , which is an additional force that can slow or prevent x - line convection and would undoubtedly modify the present results .",
    "it is possible that the tailward moving x - lines seen in observations @xcite are related to a secondary island moving tailward ; a secondary x - line is not in the same equilibrium as a single x - line , so it can convect tailward .",
    "future work is necessary to determine the conditions under which some x - lines convect and others do not , the speed at which they convect , and their signatures in the cusp .",
    "a second point worth making is that the results in this section would change in the presence of a high - density plasmaspheric drainage plume @xcite on the magnetospheric side of the dissipation region .",
    "this increases the local density , which decreases the outflow speed @xcite .",
    "plumes are most commonly observed centered around 13.6  h magnetic local time @xcite .",
    "if the magnetospheric density is comparable or larger than the magnetosheath , the x - line would not convect with the magnetosheath flow , and the full expressions from sec .",
    "[ section::theory ] would be needed .",
    "we note in passing that the significant departures between symmetric and asymmetric reconnection with a flow shear suggest that the effect of flow shear at jupiter , saturn , and uranus should be revisited .",
    "the previous work on this subject employed the predictions for symmetric reconnection , so the results are likely to change with the asymmetric reconnection results presented here .",
    "it is worth putting the present results in context of a leading model for what allows cusp reconnection to occur despite nominally super - alfvnic flow .",
    "it was argued that the draped magnetic field during northward imf compresses , and therefore increases , the magnetopause magnetic field , which itself causes the mass density to decrease , forming a density depletion layer at the magnetopause @xcite .",
    "both the increased field and decreased density increase the local alfvn speed , potentially making the flow sub - alfvnic . the present theory _",
    "should not _ be interpreted as implying that a density depletion layer does not occur or that the layer would not change the local alfvn speed . using the @xcite parameters",
    ", @xcite would suggest ( assuming that the alfvn mach number is based on magnetosheath parameters ) that a density depletion by a factor of about 2.5 would be sufficient to make the flow sub - alfvnic ( see their fig .",
    "when based on the asymmetric alfvn speed , the necessary depletion factor reduces to approximately 1.3 .",
    "clearly , more research is needed to identify the level of plasma depletion , its effect on cusp reconnection , and the extent to which the present results apply to the dayside magnetopause .",
    "in this study , we use a scaling argument based on conservation of momentum to find the convection ( drift ) speed of the x - line in anti - parallel 2d asymmetric magnetic reconnection with arbitrary upstream parallel flow speeds [ eq .  ( [ eqn::drift_eqn ] ) ] .",
    "we also present a prediction for the reconnection rate for arbitrary upstream flow speeds [ eq .  ( [ eqn::recon_rate ] ) ] .",
    "the predictions are confirmed using 2d two - fluid numerical simulations . for asymmetric magnetic fields ,",
    "the results agree well for both predictions . for asymmetric densities , simulations agree with the reconnection rate prediction , but the drift speed can not be assessed because the fluid model does not correctly model plasma mixing .",
    "in particular , the results show that the x - line convects even for sub - alfvnic flow , which contrasts the leading model by @xcite .",
    "the reconnection rate prediction gives a threshold flow shear above which reconnection does not occur [ eq .  ( [ eqn::vcrit ] ) ] , and this prediction is consistent with the simulations .",
    "this result shows that asymmetric reconnection can persist with flow shear exceeding the asymmetric alfvn speed , and can occur even with much larger flow shear speeds if the asymmetries are large .",
    "we note that the critical speed prediction in eq .",
    "( [ eqn::vcrit ] ) differs from the condition given by @xcite , who suggested the critical speed is the larger of the two alfvn speeds on either upstream side of the dissipation region .",
    "it also differs from the prediction that reconnection does not occur if the difference between the magnetosheath and magnetospheric flow exceeds twice the magnetosheath alfvn speed @xcite . to see this ,",
    "consider the simulation with @xmath179 , a uniform density of @xmath180 , and a flow of @xmath181 . here",
    ", the magnetosheath nominally corresponds to the `` 2 '' side ( with the weaker magnetic field ) . in the rest frame of the magnetosphere ( the `` 1 '' side ) ,",
    "the magnetosheath flow speed is 3.2 .",
    "this exceeds double the magnetosheath alfvn speed of 1 .",
    "the fact that reconnection is observed in this simulation is evidence against the @xcite model .",
    "the fact that we do not see reconnection in the @xmath182 simulation is evidence against the @xcite model , which is below the magnetospheric alfvn speed of 3 .",
    "the results have potentially important implications for reconnection at earth s magnetopause . for isolated x - lines ,",
    "the predictions suggest that the x - line convects essentially with the magnetosheath flow as a consequence of the stagnation point being nearly all the way to the magnetospheric side of the dissipation region .",
    "the reconnection rate is affected by only a small amount , and it would take magnetosheath flow an order of magnitude faster than the asymmetric alfvn speed to suppress reconnection .",
    "this is a major departure from the current understanding based on symmetric reconnection which claims magnetosheath flow greater than twice the alfvn speed is sufficient to suppress reconnection .",
    "the results may differ for non - isolated x - lines , such as magnetic fields line - tied to the ionosphere during reconnection near the polar cusps .",
    "the results could also drastically alter previous estimates of how flow shear affects dayside reconnection at jupiter , saturn , and uranus , so revisiting these results is important future work .",
    "another potential application is determining whether the present results impact predictions for the speed of anti - sunward propagation of flux transfer events @xcite .",
    "the present analysis made a number of simplifying assumptions that should be addressed in future work . since the analytical calculation uses the fluid picture ,",
    "finite larmor radius effects are ignored , but they may be important in the boundary layers @xcite , especially for the dayside magnetopause where the density asymmetry is typically significant . the present analysis and simulations ignore asymmetries in the outflow direction @xcite , which may be important for reconnection near the polar cusps . in particular , asymmetries in the outflow direction",
    "cause the outflow speeds to be different in the two outflow directions @xcite , so future work is necessary to determine the effect of shear flow in such systems .",
    "the present analysis and simulations also do not include a guide field , which may be present @xcite .",
    "the guide field is important because , when coupled with a gas pressure gradient across the inflow direction at the dissipation region , it can set up diamagnetic effects which also have been shown to cause the x - line to convect in the outflow direction @xcite , and therefore either reinforce or oppose the convection caused by flow shear @xcite .",
    "the analysis and simulations also do not include upstream flows in the out - of - plane direction @xcite .",
    "also , the simulations used the fluid model , which does not self - consistently capture plasma mixing in the exhaust for systems with asymmetric density @xcite ; this would be fixed using simulations employing the particle - in - cell technique @xcite .",
