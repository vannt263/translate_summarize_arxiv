    "combining anodic oxidation and scanning probe microscopy , first with the scanning tunneling microscope ( stm),@xcite later with the scanning force microscope ( sfm),@xcite has opened the way for patterning surfaces selectively in the submicron regime . apart from using the oxide pattern as an etching mask or as a substrate for material growth , ishii et al . demonstrated that an oxide line can induce a change in the resistance of a buried two - dimensional electrons gas ( 2deg).@xcite held et al .",
    "showed that oxide lines deplete a shallow 2deg in a ga[al]as heterostructures ( less than 50 nm from the surface ) completely,@xcite providing a versatile tool for the design of nanostructures with arbitrary shape and allowing topographical inspection without changing setup .",
    "@xcite the oxide height leading to a depletion of the electron gas must be chosen according to the distance of the 2deg to the sample surface , which can not be too close without increasing significantly the scattering of the electrons at the doping atoms situated between 2deg and surface .",
    "the deeper the 2deg is located below the surface , the higher the height of the oxide line required for the realization of a lateral insulator .",
    "we are therefore interested in the regime , where the oxide height is 10 nm and beyond .",
    "historically , one crucial aspect was a better understanding of the physical and chemical mechanisms dominating the oxidation process , in particular on doped silicon.@xcite two issues are closely related in view of optimal device fabrication : improving the lateral resolution and overcoming the self - limiting growth .",
    "they can be quantitatively described with the aspect ratio , which is defined as the ratio of the height and the base width of the oxide .",
    "dagata et al . pointed to the traps of ionic charges accumulating in the oxide and to the charge diffusion in the water meniscus forming between tip and sample as major contributions , referring to it as the space charge model.@xcite pulsed or modulated ( ac ) voltage instead of constant ( dc ) voltage applied between the tip and the sample was suggested to neutralize the reaction products and limit the lateral carrier diffusion .",
    "experimentally , enhanced growth in the central region of the water meniscus at the apex of the tip has been reported on n- and p - doped si,@xcite ti,@xcite and n - gaas,@xcite as well as p - gaas.@xcite the success on such a broad set of substrate materials suggests that the space charge model is applicable to local anodic oxidation in general and not restricted to a specific electro - chemical reaction , which is still debated in the case of gaas.@xcite    in this paper we investigate lines oxidized with constant and modulated voltages on undoped gaas and discuss their influence on the electronic properties of a shallow 2deg .",
    "all the lithography has been performed in non - contact mode . in sec .",
    "[ sec : locox ] we make a topographic comparison between dc and ac voltage oxidation exploring the rich parameter space .",
    "our results are in qualitative agreement with the work of other groups and can be linked to established models for local anodic oxidation .",
    "the analysis of a large set of oxidation trials showed two important results : 1 ) a clear improvement of the reliability and reproducibility when writing with ac voltage , which is encouraging in view of the design of more complex nanostructures , 2 ) an enhancement of the aspect ratio of about 15 % , which , translated into electronic properties , represents a considerable gain in electronic depletion and scaling towards more dense device architectures ( relevant quantum length scale is the fermi wave length of about 40 nm ) . in sec .",
    "[ sec : algas ] the two oxidation schemes are applied to deplete a 2deg in a ga[al]as heterostructure . a quantitative characterization of the breakdown voltage versus oxide shape is presented , which turns out to be highly sensitive .",
    "we report on transport measurements on quantum point contacts and quantum wires written with dc as well as with ac voltage .",
    "qualitatively the ac oxidation can compete with dc oxidation in terms of electronic stability , confinement potential and tunability .",
    "in local anodic oxidation a conductive sfm tip acts as the cathode whereas the grounded sample is the anode .",
    "a voltage is applied to the tip , while the sample is grounded via a metallic underlay . a thin water film covering the sample surface serves as the electrolyte .",
    "the ambient humidity is therefore actively controlled in our setup ( 42 % ) . both , for scanning and writing",
    ", the sfm ( asylum research mfp-3d ) is operated in non - contact mode with a resonance frequency between 315 - 325 khz ( force constant : 14 - 40 n / m ) .",
    "the full tip cone angle is between 20 - 30 degree , the tip curvature radius is less than 40 nm .",
    "the coating evaporated on n - doped silicon tip corresponds to 20 nm ti / 10 nm pt or 25 nm w@xmath0c .",
    "the feedback loop with amplitude damping as a control parameter is active during the writing process , which is crucial for writing more complex nanodevices consisting of many line sections .    in the following we abbreviate oxidation with a constant / modulated voltage between tip and sample with constant ( dc)/modulated ( ac ) oxidation. in the ac oxidation",
    "the tip bias consists of a square periodic signal [ inset fig .",
    "[ fig : resettime](a ) ] . compared to dc oxidation , it offers more tuning parameters .",
    "apart from the oxidation voltage @xmath1 , tip speed @xmath2 and set - point , which are also controlled during the dc oxidation , we can change the modulation frequency @xmath3 , the reset voltage @xmath4 and the oxidation time @xmath5 . in all cases",
    "we used a moderate positive reset voltage between 2 and 4 v in order to ensure the trapped ionic charges to be neutralized , but avoiding oxidation of the tip.@xcite    taking the writing velocity of 0.2 @xmath6 m/s and the base width of the oxide line of about 100 nm into account , a single spot on a line is not oxidized longer than 1 s. this is in contrast to previous experiments on n- and p - doped gaas , where dots with oxidizing times of the order of several seconds were considered.@xcite the resonance frequency of the cantilever is two orders of magnitude larger than the frequency of the ac voltage .",
    "there are two consequences : first , for each oxidation cycle ( @xmath7 ) we integrate over about @xmath8 cantilever oscillations ; second , the feedback loop is able to control the tip - sample distance during the individual oxidation and reset stages .",
    "we thus operate in a low - frequency regime .",
    "other experiments have coupled the resonance frequency of the cantilever to the modulation voltage making the phase difference an adjustable parameter for the oxidation performance.@xcite",
    "as a first application of the technique , we show the oxidation of an undoped gaas wafer ( liquid encapsulated czochralski ) .",
    "we precleaned the samples in an aceton / isopropanol / water ultrasonic bath sequence with additional plasma etching ( o@xmath9 , 120 s , at a power of 200 w ) .",
    "no special wet chemical treatment was used to remove the native oxide . since our motivation is the fabrication of devices on shallow 2degs , we focus on oxide lines with a given height of approximatly 10 nm , representing the basic building blocks for quantum point contacts , quantum wires and quantum dots .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : freq ] we will focus on the frequency dependence of the oxide height and the aspect ratio , whereas in sec .  [",
    "sec : other ] other parameters will be discussed , such as oxidation voltage , duty ratio , set - point and tip velocity . in sec .  [",
    "sec : reli ] we demonstrate the improved writing reliability based on a large collection of oxide lines .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : linesfreq ] sfm micrographs and height profiles of oxide lines written with dc and ac voltages are presented . with a writing velocity of @xmath10 @xmath6 m/s ,",
    "the 1 hz line is just an on / off cycling of shorter dc sections . in the 10 hz case the individual dots",
    "can still be seen if the right contrast is chosen . for further increased frequencies up to 1 khz consecutive pulses ( @xmath7 ) merge to form a continuous line .",
    "capacitive losses leading to a low - pass filter effect limit the operational bandwidth to a few khz .",
    "sfm images ( 1.5 @xmath6 m stripes , lines 1 @xmath6 m long ) with corresponding longitudinal oxide height profile ( dashed line marks 10 nm in height ) for ( a ) constant ( dc ) oxidation voltage and modulated ( ac ) voltages : ( b ) @xmath3=1 hz , ( c ) @xmath3=10 hz , ( d ) @xmath3=100 hz and ( e ) @xmath3=1 khz .",
    "the lines were written from right to left . for 1 hz ( b ) and",
    "10 hz ( c ) the pulse scheme of the oxidation voltage is apparent in the oxide height profiles , whereas for higher frequencies ( d),(e ) the individual sections merge to a continuous line as for the dc case ( a ) .",
    "parameters used : @xmath1=-16 v , @xmath4=4 v , @xmath11/(@xmath11+@xmath5)=50 % ( 30 % for @xmath3=1 khz ) . note that for ( c ) a different gray scale ( top ) is used.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    since for 1 and 10 hz we get a clear segmentation of oxidized and non - oxidized regions [ fig .",
    "[ fig : linesfreq](b),(c ) ] , it is not surprising that the average height taken over all the sections of the line , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : frequency ] , is reduced for low modulation frequencies .",
    "however , we stress the fact that for higher frequencies the height of the ac voltage lines reaches almost the one of the constant voltage ( dc ) lines , despite the fact that the anodizing time has been reduced by 30 % or 50 % since we kept the writing speed constant .     oxide height ( average over the line ) and aspect ratio for different modulation frequencies compared with dc writing .",
    "although the total oxidation time is reduced by 30% or 50 % compared to the dc case , we reach practically the same oxide height , but a clearly better aspect ratio at 1 khz .",
    "the tip velocity is fixed at 0.2 @xmath6 m/s for all lines .",
    "note that different sfm tips have been used ( w@xmath0c / ti - pt ) .",
    "inset : profile of neighbouring dc and ac lines .",
    "the total oxidation dose is kept constant by adjusting the writing speed : @xmath2(dc)=0.3 @xmath6 m/s / @xmath2(ac)=0.15 @xmath6 m/s , duty cycle = 50 % .,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    the same behavior is observed in the aspect ratio , since the reduction for low frequencies is mostly due to the height averaging .",
    "we find that the aspect ratio for @xmath12 khz is enhanced compared to the dc value . on the other hand we can keep the total oxidizing time constant by varying the writing speed . for a duty cycle of 50 %",
    "this implies doubling the writing speed in the dc compared to the ac case .",
    "we find [ inset fig .",
    "[ fig : frequency](b ) ] , that the line height does not vary , but a significant narrowing of the base width can be observed , indicating a reduced lateral carrier diffusion.@xcite corresponding values for a different set of lines are presented in table  [ tab : aspect ] .",
    "the enhancement of about 15 % in the aspect ratio has a dramatic effect on the insulating properties of depleted lines in an underlying two - dimensional electrons gas , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : algas ] .",
    ".[tab : aspect ] the average and standard deviation of two sets of lines ( # dc=18 lines,#ac=8 lines ) with @xmath1=-18 v fixed are listed ( further ac parameters : @xmath4=2 v , @xmath11/(@xmath11+@xmath5)=30 % , @xmath3=1 khz ) .",

    "in this paper we have shown , how improved control over the oxide growth kinetics can be achieved employing a modulated tip - sample voltage .",
    "our results are compatible with the space charge model proposed by dagata et al.@xcite we showed enhanced line aspect ratios and also better reliability and improved reproducibility applying modulated voltage on undoped gaas",
    ". these results motivated us to take advantage of this approach for depleting a shallow 2deg in a ga[al]as heterostructure .",
    "the electronic stability , the confinement potential and the tunablity were investigated in a wire and a point contact geometry . they are found to be qualitatively and quantitatively similar for oxidation with constant and modulated voltage .    the authors wish to thank j.a .",
