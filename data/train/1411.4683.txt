    "wetting of chemically and topographically heterogeneous surfaces gives rise to a rich phenomenology and a corresponding wealth of theoretical challenges.@xcite a remarkable example is that a careful combination of surface roughness and chemistry yields highly liquid - repellent and self - cleaning surfaces under given environmental conditions : this class of properties is often referred to as _",
    "superhydrophobicity_. superhydrophobicity is related to the trapping of gaseous pockets ( air and/or vapor ) inside surface roughness.@xcite we will loosely refer to this scenario as the cassie state .",
    "the superhydrophobic cassie state also favors the emergence of liquid slippage under flow conditions.@xcite however , superhydrophobicity breaks down as soon as the surface roughness becomes wet in the so - called wenzel state . as a consequence of the very different properties of the cassie and wenzel states ,",
    "there is a growing interest in designing surfaces that are capable of stabilizing the superhydrophobic cassie state . in order for such engineering effort to be effective , a thorough knowledge of the cassie - wenzel transition",
    "is required . with this objective ,",
    "we analyze here the mechanism of the cassie - wenzel transition with the string method applied to molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "the phase transition between the cassie and the wenzel states is , in most cases , characterized by large free - energy barriers.@xcite the superhydrophobic cassie state on the same surface can be stable , metastable , or unstable depending on the environmental conditions .",
    "therefore it is not correct to speak about _",
    "superhydrophobic surfaces _ , but rather about _",
    "superhydrophobic states_.@xcite the problem of designing surfaces with superhydrophobic properties is therefore one of maximizing the range of temperatures , pressures , and characteristics of the liquids / vapor phases in contact for which the cassie state is stable . in the conditions where the cassie state is not thermodynamically stable , it is nonetheless possible to exploit metastabilities to obtain long - living superhydrophobicity : this is the case , _",
    "e.g. _ , of omniphobic surfaces that present a metastable cassie state even with `` wetting '' liquids thanks to a special reentrant geometry.@xcite indeed , free - energy barriers must be much larger than the thermal energy @xmath0 in order for the metastable cassie state to survive for times that are significant for experiments and applications .",
    "knowledge of how the cassie - wenzel transition starts and evolves the transition path or wetting mechanism may yield new insights for the design of engineered surfaces .    according to the transition state theory",
    ", the rate of the cassie - wenzel transition depends exponentially on the free - energy barrier between these two states .",
    "thus , designing surfaces with the desired cassie - wenzel free - energy barrier is an effective tool for controlling the rate of the process .",
    "for instance it has recently been suggested@xcite that the cassie state is generally metastable underwater .",
    "this statement , which is based on experiments on a small number of surfaces , could be made more precise if the way in which free - energy barriers depend on the geometry of the surface roughness was known .",
    "the crucial point for applications is not whether the desired state is metastable or stable but whether it will last longer than the experiment / application .",
    "the first step in engineering surfaces is , therefore , the characterization of the wetting mechanism and of its dependence on the topography and chemistry of the surface , as well as on the thermodynamic conditions .",
    "previous works typically considered the mechanism of the cassie - wenzel transition on drops , see _ e.g. _ ref .  , but there is a growing interest in submerged surfaces where the external pressure plays a key role in the stability of the superhydrophobic state .",
    "we focus here on the latter case by studying a model system that is simple enough to allow comparison of different approaches and yet shows a surprisingly rich phenomenology ( see fig .",

    "the systems considered spanned from few nanometers ( explored _ via _ molecular dynamics simulations@xcite ) to macroscopic dimensions , for which the continuum rare events methods , or cream , was developed.@xcite over this broad range of systems , at coexistence when the cassie and wenzel state have the same free - energy , free - energy barriers are much larger than @xmath1 accounting for strong metastabilities .",
    "for all previous approaches , the wetting path was characterized following the changes in the ( coarse - grained ) density field of the fluid , @xmath2 .",
    "this , in turn , was considered a parametric function of the filling of the surface corrugation ( or liquid volume inside it ) , @xmath3 .",
    "the resulting path of the transition is the sequence @xmath4 of density fields minimizing the free - energy at a given @xmath5 .",
    "under suitable conditions , explained in sec .",

    "however , when this description was applied in combination with a macroscopic , sharp - interface macroscopic model,@xcite we obtained a discontinuous wetting path ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : intro ] ) .",
    "the discontinuity corresponds to an instantaneous switching from a symmetric liquid / vapor meniscus to an asymmetric bubble in one of the corners of the corrugation ( morphological transition ) .",
    "this discontinuity occurs at the `` transition state '' and results in a non - differentiability of the free energy profile at this point .",
    "this sharp point may have two distinct origins ,    * an algorithmic one , related to the parameterization of the wetting path with the volume of liquid in the groove used in cream * a modeling one , that is , it could arise as a genuine feature of the sharp - interface model , which was used in combination with cream.@xcite    the goal of this paper is therefore to address the question about the sharp point of the free - energy profile and , more generally , to lay on solid statistical grounds the discussion about the wetting mechanism on rough surfaces . in order to achieve this goal , we compute the _ minimum free - energy path _ ( mfep ) using the string method in collective variables.@xcite we employ atomistic simulations with the aim of making minimal assumptions on the liquid / vapor interface and the interactions with the walls .",

    "we compare atomistic with continuum , sharp - interface model paths and free - energy profiles .",
    "the continuum path is obtained with the string and cream methods .",
    "qualitatively , the atomistic and continuum wetting are consistent .",
    "surprisingly , atomistic string free - energy profile shows a better agreement with continuum cream .",
    "this is due to an `` error cancellation '' , with cream compensating intrinsic limitations in the sharp - interface model with respect to the atomistic case .",
    "the second goal of this work is to elucidate the effect of the shape of the surface corrugation and its size on the mechanism of the cassie - wenzel transition and on the related free - energy barrier . anticipating our results , the concept of transition path itself may break down if the corrugations are sufficiently small .",

    "[ fig : istring],scaledwidth=60.0% ]    here we discuss the relation between the wetting path identified by the continuum rare events method ( cream ) previously introduced in giacomello _ _ et al.__@xcite and the interface `` string '' .",
    "we start by introducing the committor function and isocommittor surfaces .",
    "the committor is the probability that a trajectory passing by a state , an atomistic or a macroscopic configuration , will reach next the product state , say wenzel , rather than the reactant state .",
    "an isocommittor surface is the ( hyper)surface in the state space of constant committor function value .",

    "let us denote by @xmath125 the normal to @xmath123 at @xmath124 , and by @xmath126 the tangent to the mfep at the same point . in ref .",
    "it is shown that : @xmath127 if we compare eq .   with eq",
    ", we conclude that the mfep is the path connecting constrained minima of the free - energy on the isocommittor surfaces @xmath128 foliating the space .",
    "similar to the string method , cream aims at identifying a wetting path .",
    "however , at variance with the string method , in cream this path is not parametrized with its arc - length but with an observable of relevance for the problem at hand .",
    "this very general framework can be applied to different models , ranging from the micro- to the macroscale ; for the macroscopic scale , in the sharp - interface model that was originally used to describe the cassie - wenzel transition , the wetting path is parametrized with the volume of liquid in the groove , @xmath129 .",
    "like in the case of the string method , in cream the free - energy is minimized subject to the constraint that the variable parametrizing the path is constant . in other words",
    ", the path obtained by cream connects the constrained minima of the free - energy on the constant volume surfaces @xmath130 .    comparing this formulation of the cream path with the formulation of the string path in terms of constrained minimization of the free - energy in the isocommittor surface ,",

    "[ fig : istring]b we compare the cream and interface string free energy profiles along the respective paths .",
    "we remark that the profiles coincide for most of the path , departing from each other only in a relatively small region around the transition state .",
    "this is not surprising because , at variance with the string , cream does not impose the continuity of the path .",
    "thus , in the case of the cassie - wentzel transition , which takes place through a morphological transition ( see ref .   and sec .",

    "[ fig : istring]b we report also the free - energy profile obtained from atomistic simulations .",
    "the agreement seems to be better between atomistic and cream results than with interface string .",
    "the reason for this is discussed more in detail in the results section ; here we remark that this better agreement is due to `` errors cancellation '' , with the underestimation of the barrier in cream compensating for an overestimation intrinsic to the sharp - interface models .     while the other represents the complementary degrees of freedom .",

    "this is the plane on which @xmath134 is zero .",
    "the dashed line in panel ( b ) , instead , represents the hypersurface @xmath135 , i.e. one of the infinite hypersurfaces on which the minimum of the free energy is sought in the cream method .",
    "the string path follows the valley of the reactants and then moves smoothly to the valley of the products .",
    "when the reactants and products valleys become parallel , the cream path moves abruptly from one to the other , following the minimum of the free - energy corresponding to a given level of progress of the reaction .",
    "this is shown on the panel ( b ) : the yellow line denotes the two branches of the cream path , and the gray double arrow highlights its discontinuity . [",
    "fig : creamvsstringpaths],scaledwidth=80.0% ]    summarizing , the paths obtained from cream and the string method are not identical but give the same qualitative description of the process .",
    "while the string method gives a detailed and continuous description of the most likely wetting path all along the process , cream represents the segment around the transition state as a sharp morphological transition ( fig .",
    "[ fig : creamvsstringpaths ] ) .",
    "indeed , cream and the string can be used as complementary tools .",
    "cream allows to efficiently compute all the possible `` reactive '' channels .",
    "the string method can then be used to further refine the cream paths . when the system is relatively simple , like the case of wetting of a square groove ,  @xcite it is possible to obtain the analytical solution of the cream equations .",
    "thanks to cream it was possible to derive an extended version of the laplace equation , which relates the liquid / gas meniscus curvature to the surface tension . this relation , that was introduced for the first time in ref .",
    ", is valid along most of the wetting path , apart in the region connecting the symmetric meniscus and gas - bubble - in - a - corner morphologies .",

    "[ fig : path]a we show the transition path for the square groove , _ i.e. _ , the sequence of average density fields forming the string at convergence .",
    "the meniscus is initially flat close to the cassie state .",
    "as the transition proceeds , the meniscus descends into the groove with constant curvature ( images @xmath144-@xmath145 ) until close to the bottom a liquid finger is formed on the right side of the groove ( images @xmath146-@xmath147 ) .",
    "eventually the liquid wets one corner of the groove forming a circular bubble that gradually shrinks ( images @xmath148-@xmath149 ) until it is completely absorbed and the wenzel state is reached ( images @xmath143-@xmath138 ) .",
    "the initial and final parts of the path ( the initial pinning , the symmetric meniscus , and the final bubble in the corner ) are in fair agreement with previous restrained molecular dynamics simulations @xcite and the macroscopic cream results @xcite ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : intro ] ) . however , close to the transition state the liquid - vapor interface forms a finger thus departing from the constant curvature menisci prescribed by cream .",
    "this discrepancy is explained by the interface string path which , close to the transition state , exhibits a point of the meniscus with high curvature ( similar to the atomistic finger ) that eventually touches the bottom wall creating a small and a large bubble ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : istring]a ) .",
    "the fine details of the process , however , are not easy to compare , because the diffuse nature of the atomistic interface tends to smear out sharp points and small vapor domains ; to this must be added that computational constraints limit the number of images and coarse - graining cells in the atomistic string .    the rectangular groove measures around @xmath150 and is therefore twice as wide as the square one .",
    "the thermodynamic conditions of the npt simulations were @xmath140 and @xmath151 for this case .",
    "more than @xmath143 steps of string evolution were required for convergence .",
    "the mfep for the rectangular groove is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : path]b .",
    "it is seen that before the cassie minimum the meniscus curvature is allowed to vary while the triple line is pinned at the top corners of the groove ( images @xmath95-@xmath152 ) , as is expected from the macroscopic gibbs criterion  @xcite .",
    "this is an evidence that pinning happens also at the nanoscale , even though in a particle description of the system the continuum concept of `` geometrical singularity '' ( corners at the top of the groove , in the present case ) has no meaning .",
    "however , the string resolution ( number of images ) does not allow us to quantify the range of contact angles for which pinning occurs .",
    "the intrusion into the groove happens when a sufficiently large meniscus curvature is reached , around image @xmath152 .",
    "the meniscus bends towards one corner at images @xmath153-@xmath154 , earlier in the progress of the transition than in the case of the square groove .",
    "this observation can be made more quantitative by considering the length of the string up to the transition state and normalizing it with the total length of the string concerned with the activated event , that is , @xmath155 , where @xmath9 is the image number ; for the rectangular groove @xmath156 , while for the square one @xmath157 .",
    "the contact line touches the bottom wall ( on the right hand side ) and recedes `` rapidly '' towards the opposite corner while the contact line at the vertical wall on the left does not move . as a consequence , during the shrinking process the bubble at the corner starts with a slightly flattened shape and then tends to a circular one .",
    "this mechanism seems a generic one for the contact with the wall , since the interface string path for the square groove also shows that the left contact line behaves as if it were `` pinned '' at the vertical wall  although there is no defect  while the right contact line slides on the bottom wall ( see fig .",

    "[ fig : ts_ensemble ] we show atomistic configurations extracted from the transition state ensemble of the square groove ; these microstates were computed _ via _ rmd as detailed in sec .",
    "[ sec : ts ] .",
    "it is apparent that the microscopic configurations correspond to several macroscopic states : bubble on the right corner , on the left one , and in the center .",
    "for the larger rectangular groove , instead , the transition state ensemble is connected with a well defined configuration featuring a bubble in the left corner , similar to that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : path]b ( see also the related movie for movies of the transition paths and the transition state ensemble . ] ) .",
    "we ascribe this behavior to the flat free - energy landscape along the hyperplane orthogonal to the transition state .",
    "when the barrier separating the symmetry - related wetting paths ( bubble - on - the - left and bubble - on - the - right corners ) is @xmath163 the system can easily jump from one to the other . in this case , the wetting path identified by the string ( and cream ) method has little statistical significance .",
    "in other words , the transition tubes  @xcite around the two specular paths , i.e. , the region of state space in which most of the transition trajectories pass through , overlap .",

    "would be needed to capture information about the transition .",
    "these results suggest that the macroscopic models of capillary systems have a lower length scale below which they break down : the free - energy landscape becomes too flat to identify a single _",

    "the energetic costs of forming liquid - vapor or solid - vapor interfaces and of wetting the bottom wall are defined in eqs .   and , respectively .",
    "the results are computed via the interface string with @xmath165 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and @xmath116 .",
    "[ fig : energy_balance],scaledwidth=60.0% ]    the interface string calculations were performed for the square groove in the region of the transition state ( the maximum of the profile ) , which is critical both for evaluating the free - energy barriers and for testing the cream results . as shown by the free - energy profiles in fig .",
    "[ fig : istring]b at low filling levels ( @xmath166 ) and high ones ( @xmath167 ) the interface string coincides with cream . around the transition state , instead , the interface string significantly departs from cream .",
    "the transition state itself coincides with a cusp in the free - energy profile , while in cream it is a non - differentiable point ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : intro ] ) .",
    "ironically , the jump discontinuity in the derivative at the transition state found with cream induced us to further investigate the phenomenon , which is actually more severe in the full - fledged string which shows an infinite discontinuity of the derivative ( in the sharp - interface limit @xmath168 ) .",
    "the interface string however guarantees the continuity of the transition path , which is consistent with a continuous dynamics .",
    "the cusp arises because in touching the bottom wall the radius of curvature of the meniscus has to change sign from positive ( symmetric meniscus ) to negative ( asymmetric bubble ) .",
    "this is realized with a single point of zero radius of curvature ( and infinite curvature ) developing on a side of the liquid - vapor interface just before the contact with the bottom wall ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : istring]a ) .",
    "a different point of view is that the area of the liquid - vapor interface significantly increases during the formation of the liquid `` finger '' while @xmath129 remains almost constant , thus giving rise to the sharp increase of the free - energy at the transition state as clearly shown by the energy balance in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy_balance ] .",
    "the thermodynamic force @xmath169 corresponding to the finger becomes infinite at the transition state .",
    "this divergence of @xmath169 is integrable , thus giving rise to the cusp in the free - energy profile of fig .",
    "[ fig : istring]b .    in all cases analyzed  atomistic , interface string , and cream  the transition state is connected with the contact of the liquid domain with the bottom wall of the groove ( compare the paths in figs .  [",
    "fig : path ] , [ fig : istring]a , and [ fig : intro ] with the free free - energy profiles in figs .",
    "[ fig : istring]b ) : while the meniscus descends symmetrically in the groove , the free - energy grows steadily because of the substitution of vapor - solid interface with liquid - solid one which is unfavorable for hydrophobic materials ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : energy_balance ] ) ; when contact of the meniscus with the bottom wall eventually occurs , new liquid - solid interface replaces the liquid - vapor and solid - vapor interfaces at the bottom , resulting in an overall reduction of the free - energy ( the negative term @xmath170 in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy_balance ] ) .    in the atomistic string",
    ", the transition state is found around one - half of the string for the rectangular groove while it is towards the end of it for the square one ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : profiles ] ) .",
    "the location of the transition thus depends on the aspect ratio of the groove ; this fact is easily explained by the balance of the energy contributions above : for a taller groove the ( growing ) branch of the free - energy connected with the meniscus sliding on the vertical walls of the groove is longer , while the descending branch due to the shrinking bubble is steeper .",
    "the atomistic free - energy profiles reported in fig .  [ fig : profiles ] are smooth at the transition state , differently from those obtained _ via _ the interface string and _ via _ cream ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : istring]b ) . in the atomistic case ,",
    "indeed , thermal fluctuations tend to smear out the extreme events seen in the sharp - interface models .",
    "in particular , the formation of a point in the meniscus with very high curvature is impossible in an atomistic picture . in order to account for this effect , we repeat the interface string calculations at increasing values of @xmath92 , which correspond to wider liquid - vapor interfaces , see fig .  [",
    "fig : istring]c .",
    "the case @xmath171 roughly corresponds to the atomistic one , where the ratio of the interface thickness and the groove width is also @xmath172 .",
    "figure  [ fig : istring]c demonstrates that in the case of diffuse interfaces the transition state is smooth and the height of the free - energy barrier tends to decrease .",
    "the atomistic string method in the density field collective variable was applied for the first time to the cassie - wenzel transition to determine rigorously the mechanism of the transition .",
    "the results of this work are both methodological and physical . from the methodological point of view",
    ", we demonstrated the relationship between approximate macroscopic methods@xcite and the full - fledged interface string .",
    "the former methods are algorithmically simple and computationally convenient but fail where more parallel valleys are present in the free - energy landscape .",
    "the string simulations also offered physical insight into the mechanism of the cassie - wenzel transition from the nanoscale to the macroscale .",
    "a morphological transition was observed during the rare event with the meniscus changing from a symmetric to an asymmetric configuration .",
    "the contact of the meniscus with the bottom wall determines the position and shape of the transition state ; at the nanoscale the transition state is smooth , while in macroscopic models it shows a cusp - like behavior .",
    "the free - energy barriers are large compared to @xmath0 even in nanoscale grooves ; the depth of the groove and its aspect ratio are the critical parameters to determine the kinetics of the cassie - wenzel transition .",
    "it was also shown that for very small grooves ( width @xmath173 ) the concept of transition path breaks down and it is not possible to identify a unique sequence of macroscopic configurations that describe the cassie - wenzel transition .",
