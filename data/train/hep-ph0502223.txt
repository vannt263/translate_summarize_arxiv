    "accordingly , we have divided the data in 16 @xmath35 bins : 15 bins between @xmath146 and @xmath147 gev and one containing all events above @xmath148 gev . in the figure",
    "the full lines include both the @xmath7-induced events ( eq.([eq : numuevents ] ) ) and @xmath46-induced events ( eq.([eq : nutauevents ] ) ) while the last ones are not included in the dashed curves .",
    "as described above , the net result of including the @xmath46-induced events is a slight decrease of the maximum expected value of the double ratio .",
    "the data points in the figure show the expected statistical error corresponding to the observation of no np effects in 10 years of icecube .    in order to estimate the expected sensitivity we assume that no np effect is observed and define a simple @xmath149 function as @xmath150 where @xmath151 is computed from the expected number of events in the absence of np effects ( see table  [ tab : nevents ] ) .",

    "the difference is about 50% in the strongest bound on @xmath138 .",
    "sensitivity limits in the @xmath155 at 90 , 95 , 99 and 3 @xmath153 cl .",
    "the hatched area in the upper right corner is the present @xmath80 bound from the analysis of sk data in ref .",
    "@xcite.,width=432 ]    the figure illustrates the improvement on the present bounds by more than two orders of magnitude even within the context of this very conservative analysis .",
    "the loss of sensitivity at large @xmath138 is a consequence of the use of a double ratio as an observable .",
    "such an observable is insensitive to np effects if @xmath138 is large enough for the oscillations to be always averaged leading only to an overall suppression .",
    "when data becomes available a more realistic analysis is likely to lead to a further improvement of the sensitivity .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the physics that can be probed with the high - statistics high - energy data on atmospheric neutrinos which will be collected by the icecube detector . in order to do so",
    "first we have developed a semianalytical simulation of the detector performance .",
    "in particular , we present in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : aeff])([eq : athetaup ] ) the parametrization of the effective area of the detector which correctly reproduces the results of the detailed experimental mc for the response of the icecube detector after events that are not neutrinos have been rejected using the quality cuts referred to as level 2 cuts .",
    "we conclude that in 10 years of operation icecube will collect more than 700 thousand atmospheric neutrino events with energies @xmath44 gev which offer a unique opportunity to test new physics mechanisms for leptonic flavour mixing which are not suppressed at high energy .",
    "in general these effects are expected to induce an energy dependent angular distortion of the events .",
    "next , because of the relatively high energy of the neutrino sample , np induced flavour oscillations , propagation in the earth , regeneration of neutrinos due to @xmath1 decay must be treated in a consistent way . in sec .",
    "[ sec : formaprop ] we have presented the corresponding evolution equations .",
    "we conclude that for steeply falling neutrino energy spectra , such as the atmospheric neutrino one , the dominant effect together with flavour oscillations is the attenuation of the oscillation amplitude due to inelastic cc and nc interactions of the neutrinos in the earth in conjunction with the production @xmath46-induced muon events due to the chain @xmath156 in the vicinity of the detector .",
    "@xmath46-induced muon events can increase the event sample by at most @xmath157 .",
    "finally we have applied these results to realistically evaluate the reach of icecube in studying physics beyond conventional neutrino oscillations induced by violation of lorentz invariance and/or the equivalence principle . in fig .",
    "[ fig : chisq ] we show how even with a very conservative analysis the range of testable sizes of these effects can be easily extended by more than two orders of magnitude .",
