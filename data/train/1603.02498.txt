    "the d0 collaboration fitted the @xmath8 systems with the breit - wigner parameters in relative s - wave , the favored quantum numbers are @xmath9 .",
    "however , the quantum numbers @xmath10 can not be excluded according to decays @xmath11 , where the low - energy photon is not detected .",
    "there have been several possible assignments , such as the scalar - diquark - scalar - antidiquark type tetraquark state @xcite , axialvector - diquark - axialvector - antidiquark type tetraquark state @xcite , @xmath12 hadronic molecule state @xcite , threshold effect @xcite .",
    "the calculations based on the qcd sum rules indicate that both the scalar - diquark - scalar - antidiquark type and axialvector - diquark - axialvector - antidiquark type interpolating currents can give satisfactory mass @xmath13 to reproduce the experimental data @xcite . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "agaev , azizi and sundu choose the axialvector - diquark - axialvector - antidiquark type interpolating current , calculate the hadronic coupling constant @xmath1 with the light - cone qcd sum rules in conjunction with the soft-@xmath14 approximation and other approximations , and obtain the partial decay width for the process @xmath2 . in ref.@xcite , dias et al choose the scalar - diquark - scalar - antidiquark type interpolating current , calculate the hadronic coupling constant @xmath1 with the three - point qcd sum rules in the soft-@xmath14 limit by taking into account only the connected feynman diagrams in the leading order approximation , and obtain the partial decay width for the decay @xmath2 . in previous work @xcite , we choose the scalar - diquark - scalar - antidiquark type interpolating current to study the mass of the @xmath0 with the qcd sum rules . in this article",
    ", we extend our previous work to study the hadronic coupling constant @xmath1 with the three - point qcd sum rules by carrying out the operator product expansion up to the vacuum condensates of dimension-6 and including both the connected and disconnected feynman diagrams , then calculate the partial decay width of the strong decay @xmath2 .",
    "the article is arranged as follows : we derive the qcd sum rule for the hadronic coupling constant @xmath15 in sect.2 ; in sect.3 , we present the numerical results and discussions ; and sect.4 is reserved for our conclusion .",
    "we can study the strong decay @xmath16 with the three - point correlation function @xmath17 , @xmath18 where the currents @xmath19 interpolate the mesons @xmath20 , @xmath14 and @xmath0 , respectively , the @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 are color indexes , the @xmath26 is the charge conjugation matrix . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the axialvector current is used to interpolate the @xmath14 meson .    at the hadron side ,",
    "we insert a complete set of intermediate hadronic states with the same quantum numbers as the current operators @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 into the three - point correlation function @xmath17 and isolate the ground state contributions to obtain the following result , @xmath30 where @xmath31 , the @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the decay constants of the mesons @xmath20 , @xmath14 and @xmath0 , respectively , the @xmath1 is the hadronic coupling constant .    in the following ,",
    "we write down the definitions , @xmath35    the two unknown functions @xmath36 and @xmath37 have complex dependence on the transitions between the ground state @xmath0 and the excited states of the @xmath14 and @xmath20 mesons , respectively . we introduce the parameters @xmath38 and @xmath39 to parameterize the net effects , @xmath40 and rewrite the correlation function @xmath17 into the following form , @xmath41    we set @xmath42 and take the double borel transform with respect to the variable @xmath43 and @xmath44 respectively to obtain the qcd sum rule at the left side ( ls ) , @xmath45 in calculations , we neglect the dependencies of the @xmath38 and @xmath39 on the variables @xmath46 therefore the dependencies of the @xmath38 and @xmath39 on the variables @xmath47 and @xmath48 , take the @xmath38 and @xmath39 as free parameters , and choose the suitable values to eliminate the contaminations so as to obtain the stable sum rules with the variations of the borel parameters @xcite .",

    "for example , the first diagram is calculated in the following ways , @xmath52 ^ 2(l+q)^2 l^2 } \\nonumber\\\\ & = & -\\frac{6}{(2\\pi)^8 } \\frac{(-2\\pi i)^2}{2\\pi i } \\int_{m_b^2}^\\infty ds \\frac{1}{s - p^2}\\int d^4k\\ , \\delta \\left [ k^2\\right ] \\delta \\left [ ( k+p)^2-m_b^2\\right ] \\frac{(-2\\pi i)^2}{2\\pi i } \\int_{0}^\\infty du \\frac{1}{u - q^2}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\int d^4l\\ , \\delta \\left [ l^2\\right ] \\delta \\left [ ( l+q)^2\\right]{\\rm tr } \\left\\ { \\gamma_5 ( \\!\\not\\!{k}+m_s)\\gamma_5 ( \\!\\not\\!{k}+\\!\\not\\!{p}+m_b)\\gamma_5(\\!\\not\\!{l}+\\!\\not\\!{q})\\gamma_5 \\!\\not\\!{l}\\right\\}\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{3}{128\\pi^4}\\int_{m_b^2}^\\infty ds \\frac{1}{s - p^2 } \\frac{(s - m_b^2)^2}{s}\\int_{0}^\\infty du \\frac{u}{u - q^2}\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{3m_s m_b}{64\\pi^4}\\int_{m_b^2}^\\infty ds \\frac{1}{s - p^2 } \\frac{s - m_b^2}{s}\\int_{0}^\\infty du \\frac{u}{u - q^2 } \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the operator product expansion converges for large @xmath53 and @xmath54 , it is odd to take the limit @xmath55 .",
    "then we set @xmath42 , take the quark - hadron duality below the continuum thresholds , and perform the double borel transform with respect to the variables @xmath43 and @xmath44 respectively to obtain the perturbative term , @xmath56 where the @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the continuum threshold parameters for the @xmath0 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "other feynman diagrams are calculated in analogous ways , finally we obtain the qcd sum rules at the right side ( rs ) , @xmath59 the terms @xmath60 disappear after performing the double borel transform , the last feynman diagram in fig.1 have no contribution .    in refs.@xcite , the width of the @xmath61 is studied with the three - point qcd sum rules by including both the connected and disconnected feynman diagrams , which is contrary to ref.@xcite , where only the connected feynman diagrams are taken into account to study the width of the @xmath62 . in this article , the contributions come from the connected diagrams can be written as @xmath63 , @xmath64 which is too small to account for the experimental data @xcite .",
    "finally , we obtain the qcd sum rule , @xmath65    there appear some energy scale dependence at the hadron side ( or ls ) of the qcd sum rule according to the factors @xmath66 and @xmath67 , we can eliminate the energy scale dependence by using the currents @xmath68 and @xmath69 , @xmath70 then @xmath71 and @xmath72 the resulting qcd sum rule at the right side also acquires a factor @xmath73 , a equivalent qcd sum rule is obtained , the predicted hadronic coupling constant @xmath1 is not changed .",

    "we should multiply both sides of eq.(19 ) by @xmath94 to eliminate the contaminations of the axialvector mesons @xmath83 and @xmath84 , @xmath95 which corresponds to taking the pseudoscalar currents @xmath68 and @xmath69 according to the following identities , @xmath96 the axialvector currents @xmath77 and @xmath78 can also be chosen to study the strong decay @xmath16 .",
    "we also expect to study the strong decay @xmath16 with the light - cone qcd sum rules using the two - point correlation function @xmath97 , @xmath98 where the @xmath99 is an external @xmath14 state .    at the qcd side , we obtain the following result after performing the wick s contraction , @xmath100 where the @xmath101 and @xmath102 are the full @xmath103 and @xmath104 quark propagators , respectively .",
