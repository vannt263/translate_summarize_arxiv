    "in the work of lehmann , newton , and wu @xcite , the kobayashi - maskawa @xcite matrix is expressed in terms of the masses of the three generations of quarks : @xmath10 this is accomplished by introducing a new horizontal symmetry .",
    "some of the earlier attempts in this direction are given in @xcite .",
    "recent experiments at super - kamiokande indicate the presence of neutrino oscillations , which would imply that the neutrinos are not all massless .",
    "if it is accepted that the neutrinos are not massless , then it is most natural in the standard model @xcite to introduce three right - handed neutrinos in addition to the three known left - handed ones . in this way",
    ", there are six quarks and six leptons . in this paper , the consequences of a universal quark - lepton mixing are studied . in other words , the method of @xcite",
    "is used to express the lepton km matrix and the neutrino mixing matrix in terms of the masses of the three generations of leptons : @xmath11 of course the masses of the three charged leptons are accurately known , leaving as unknown parameters the masses of the three neutrinos .",
    "thus there are three parameters to be determined instead of seven , the three masses plus the four in the lepton km matrix .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to use the data from solar neutrinos @xcite and atmospheric neutrinos @xcite to determine the three neutrino masses separately , not only the differences of their squares .",
    "the quark mixing matrix proposed by lehmann et al .  @xcite relates the mixing to the actual quark masses .",
    "these mass matrices are each given by four parameters @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , and , when applied to the leptons without modification , take the form @xmath16 \\label{eq : mu - nondiag } m(\\nu)&=&\\begin{pmatrix } 0     & id(\\nu ) & 0",
    "\\\\ -id(\\nu ) & c(\\nu ) & b(\\nu ) \\\\ 0     & b(\\nu ) &",
    "a(\\nu ) \\end{pmatrix},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath17    the diagonalization of these mass matrices @xcite is achieved by the orthogonal matrices @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where @xmath20 \\label{eq : diagonal - u } m(\\nu)&=&{{\\rm diag}}(-i,1,1)r(\\nu)m_{\\rm diag}(\\nu)r^{\\rm t}(\\nu){{\\rm diag}}(i,1,1).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "if there is @xmath21 violation in the lepton sector , then the imaginary entries in ( [ eq : mu - nondiag ] ) and ( [ eq : diagonal - u ] ) are required .",
    "if by any chance there is no @xmath21 violation in the lepton sector , then both @xmath22 and @xmath23 there should be replaced by 1 .",
    "the diagonal mass matrices have the form @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 we shall here only be concerned with @xmath27 and @xmath19 .",
    "in dealing with quarks @xcite , the observed quark masses allow a much stronger form for the inequality ( [ eq : mass - order ] ) , namely @xmath28 the lack of direct experimental data on the neutrino masses implies that ( [ eq : mass - order ] ) can be used , but not ( [ eq : mass - order - quarks ] ) .",
    "the first task is therefore to determine the allowed region in the space @xmath29 , which must be between those permitted by ( [ eq : mass - order ] ) and ( [ eq : mass - order - quarks ] ) .",
    "the parameters @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 are related to the masses by the following conditions , @xmath30 the cubic equation for the parameter @xmath12 is then @xmath31 any real cubic equation can have either one or three real solutions . where there is _ one _ real solution , that one is negative , and thus unphysical , as is seen from ( [ eq : m1m2m3 ] ) . where there are _ three _ real solutions , one of them is negative , while two are positive .",
    "we shall refer to these two positive solutions as solution 1 ( larger @xmath12 ) and solution 2 ( smaller @xmath12 ) .",
    "these considerations can be used to determine the allowed physical region in the @xmath32 plane , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : disc ] .",
    "this region is only slightly larger than the triangle given by the inequality ( [ eq : mass - order - quarks ] ) , with two additional regions , one where @xmath33 and the other a very small one with @xmath34 .",
    "[ fig : disc ]    ( 12,9.5 ) ( 2.0,1.0 )",
    "the coupled equations satisfied by the three neutrino wave functions are @xcite @xmath35 \\begin{pmatrix } \\phi_1(r ) \\\\",
    "\\phi_2(r ) \\\\",
    "\\phi_3(r ) \\end{pmatrix},\\ ] ] where @xmath36 , with @xmath37 the fermi weak - interaction constant and @xmath38 the solar electron density at a distance @xmath39 from the center of the sun .",
    "furthermore , we denote @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 .    the evolution of the neutrino wave functions is determined by the squared mass matrix , @xmath43 ^ 2 = \\begin{pmatrix } d^2 & cd & bd \\\\ cd & b^2+c^2+d^2 & b(a+c ) \\\\ bd & b(a+c ) & a^2+b^2 \\end{pmatrix } \\equiv\\begin{pmatrix } m^2_{11 } & m^2_{12 } & m^2_{13}\\\\ m^2_{21 } & m^2_{22 } & m^2_{23}\\\\ m^2_{31 } & m^2_{32 } & m^2_{33 } \\end{pmatrix},\\ ] ] the neutrino momentum , @xmath44 , and the solar electron density . here , @xmath45 .",
    "the eigenvalues of the squared mass matrix ( multiplied by @xmath46 , with @xmath47 defined below ) are denoted @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 , and ordered such that @xmath51    it is actually a good approximation to take an exponential electron density , @xmath52 .",
    "a fit to the solar density as given by @xcite leads to @xmath53  km .",
    "for this case of an exponential solar density , the three - component wave equation can be solved in terms of generalized hypergeometric functions , @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "we scale and shift the radial variable , @xmath55 , with @xmath56 determined such that @xmath57 the above equation ( [ eq : schr-1 ] ) may then be written as @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 denote the eigenvalues of the @xmath61 mass matrix involving @xmath62 and @xmath63 .    with @xmath64 ,",
    "one finds for @xmath65 a differential equation of the form @xmath66 \\psi_1=0\\ ] ] the solutions of which , @xmath67 can be given in terms of generalized hypergeometric functions @xmath54 as @xmath68\\ ] ] with @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 .",
    "for the other flavours , @xmath72 and @xmath73 are given by similar expressions , with shifted parameters .",
    "there is not much information about these functions @xmath54 in the literature @xcite . for the case of two flavours , the products in ( [ eq : ode ] ) go only up to @xmath74 , and",
    "a familiar confluent hypergeometric function @xmath75 ( also denoted whittaker function or parabolic cylinder function ) is obtained @xcite .    in order to impose the boundary conditions that only _ electron _",
    "neutrinos are produced in the sun , we have to determine these functions at large and negative values of @xmath76 .",
    "the series expansion is in principle convergent , but it is not practical for large absolute values of both parameters and the argument .",
    "instead , methods have been developed for the evaluation by a combination of relating them to @xmath77 and asymptotic methods @xcite .",
    "since the only unknown parameters for the present theory of universal quark - lepton mixing are the three neutrino masses , it remains to determine these masses using experimental data on solar and atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "for the atmospheric neutrinos we take the 8 data points for @xmath78 and the 8 data points for @xmath79 , as reported recently @xcite .",
    "these sixteen data points are treated as separate inputs , but we allow two overall normalization constants for the two sets of data .    for the solar - neutrino data , we use the total rates from the chlorine experiment @xcite , the gallium experiments @xcite ( we average the two results ) and the super - kamiokande experiment @xcite .",
    "we adopt the neutrino energy spectra and detector efficiencies as given by bahcall et al . , and , for the latter detector , we also include the neutral - current cross section @xcite .",
    "the determination of the three neutrino masses is to be carried out by a @xmath0 fit to these pieces of data .",
    "since the number of degrees of freedom is 14 , a good @xmath0 fit would give support to this idea that the mass mixing is universal for quarks and leptons .",
    "for this purpose , we have scanned the entire ( @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 ) parameter space .",
    "it is the necessity to cover this entire space that makes it essential to develop the theory described in sec .  3 here .",
    "a few simple conclusions can be drawn from this set of mass values .",
    "first , with 14 degrees of freedom , the three values of @xmath0 must be considered to be quite good .",
    "_ this is evidence in favour of universal quark - lepton mixing_. in our mind the difference in these three values of @xmath0 is not significant .",
    "secondly , the three values for @xmath81 are the same  a surprise to us .",
    "this presumably means that the relative accuracy in the present determination of @xmath81 is better than those of @xmath80 and @xmath82 .",
    "this can be understood in the following way .",
    "the relative accuracy for @xmath80 is low because @xmath80 itself is quite small , and the value of @xmath0 is not very sensitive to such small masses .",
    "the average of these three @xmath80 is given in the abstract , and very roughly we guess the error to be about a factor of two .",
    "on the other hand , the uncertainly in the value of @xmath82 is simply due to the three minima giving different values .",
    "it is a matter of which one of the three minima is physically the correct one .      to demonstrate the scanning of the entire region of allowed values of neutrino masses , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : sol2-lvls - fin ] an example of such a scan showing contours of constant @xmath0 . in this figure ,",
    "the value of @xmath82 used is 0.058  ev , corresponding to the minimum ( b ) above .",
    "it is from such scans that we know there are only three minima . in this figure , some minor irregularities along the edges of the allowed region are artifacts of the finite grid spacing .        it is difficult to compare the present result with the previously given allowed regions in the parameter space .",
    "the reason is that the allowed regions have typically been given on the basis of the mixing of two neutrino species , while there is significant mixing among all three neutrinos , or the studies concentrate on _ either _ solar _ or _ atmospheric neutrinos @xcite .",
    "the following comparisons are nevertheless of interest .",
    "\\(a ) it is probably correct to compare the @xmath88 here with the @xmath89 from atmospheric - neutrino data . in this case",
    ", the @xmath88 for the three minima covers roughly the allowed range of @xmath89 , with minimum ( b ) near the center , and minima ( a ) and ( c ) near the edges of the allowed region .",
    "\\(b ) it is probably not too far wrong to identify @xmath90 here with the @xmath89 from solar - neutrino data .",
    "if so , the values are reasonably close , except with the so - called `` low - mass  low - probability '' ( low ) solution @xcite .",
    "\\(c ) it is more difficult to discuss the strength of the coupling",
    ". it can nevertheless be concluded , in the context of solar neutrinos , that the present solutions are significantly closer to the `` large - mixing - angle '' ( lma ) solution than to the `` small - mixing - angle '' ( sma ) solution .    in connection with the problem of distinguishing between the three minima ,",
    "more accurate data from super - kamiokande and related experiments are needed .",
    "also , a better understanding of the high - energy @xmath91 neutrino flux @xcite could make the electron recoil energy spectrum useful for this purpose .",
    "furthermore , important information may be forthcoming also from the long - baseline experiments @xcite and exotic atom experiments @xcite .",
    "we are greatly indebted to professor harry lehmann and professor jack steinberger for the most helpful discussions .",
    "we would also like to thank dr .",
    "steve armstrong , professor alvaro de rujula , dr .  conrad newton , professor gabriele veneziano , and especially geir vigdel , for useful discussions .",
