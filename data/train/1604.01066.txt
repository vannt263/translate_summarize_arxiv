    "whispering gallery modes ( wgms ) have been a source of fascination to physicists since at least the work of lord rayleigh in 1910 @xcite , when he explained the phenomenon that a whisper in one end of the gallery of st .",
    "paul s cathedral could be heard at the other end .",
    "this phenomenon has practical implications as well , since wgms in resonators with cylindrical or spherical symmetry can have very high quality ( q ) factors . in the last two decades , micro - cavity resonators",
    "have been increasingly used to generate and filter narrowband light @xcite . the quest to obtain pure optical frequency sources",
    "was revolutionized in 2000 with the invention of locked frequency comb lasers @xcite .",
    "this revolution was enabled by technology that allowed the inventors of the comb laser to achieve a factor of two ( an octave ) of bandwidth . however , these sources have the drawback that they are typically bulky and expensive . today , we may be on the verge of a second revolution in frequency generation .",
    "in fact , in the past eight years it has been demonstrated that it is possible to use wgm micro - resonators to generate solitons and hence broadband combs @xcite and , within the past year , they have been used to generate nearly an octave of bandwidth and to lock the carrier - envelope phase @xcite .",
    "however , the process by which these modes are generated remains poorly understood .",
    "it has been demonstrated that single modes are governed by the lugiato - lefever equation ( lle ) @xcite ; however , there is recent experimental evidence that mode coupling can play a critical role in obtaining a broad bandwidth comb @xcite .",
    "that is particularly the case at optical and near - ultraviolet ( uv ) wavelengths at which the modes typically have normal dispersion and solitons can not be obtained from a single mode .",
    "+ in this letter , we present for the first time coupled lles that describe the coupling of two wgms in a resonator in which chromatic dispersion , the kerr nonlinearity , and an external pump are all present .",
    "these equations resemble the coupled nonlinear schrdinger equations ( nlses ) that describe mode coupling in optical fibers and waveguides @xcite and bose - einstein condensates @xcite . however , the presence of the pump and the periodicity of the resonator change the equations in a fundamental way .",
    "it is no longer possible to remove the phase velocity difference from the equations by separately shifting the central frequencies of each of the modes because that changes their frequency difference from the pump .",
    "it is natural to choose the central frequency for each mode so that it matches the pump frequency .",
    "moreover , periodic boundary conditions must be imposed along the spatial coordinate of the resonator . among consequences",
    ", we will find that solitons typically form on a broad pedestal , and it is possible to obtain the modulational instability ( mi ) in the normal dispersion regime . while our own focus is on applications to micro - resonators",
    ", we note that the lle has a broad range of applications throughout physics .",
    "since nonlinear mode coupling is a phenomenon that occurs in many physical systems , we anticipate that the equations and the phenomena that we describe here will have a similarly broad range of applications .",
    "our aim in this paper is twofold : first , we provide an _ ab initio _ derivation of the set of externally driven , coupled , damped , nlses , or coupled lles , that account for nonlinear mode coupling in a wgm resonator with a kerr ( @xmath0 nonlinearity .",

    "our goal is to write eq .",
    "( a.16 ) in a form that just includes envelope fields @xmath243 , so that we obtain coupled nonlinear wave equations for @xmath243 . in doing so , we make several approximations .",
    "first , we suppose that the decay times for all the modes of the same family are the same : @xmath244 . for high - q wgm resonators , we generally have decay times on the order of @xmath245 and q - factors given by @xmath246 .",
    "second , we suppose that , as is usual in nonlinear optical phenomena , the effects of the nonlinearity and of the pump on the envelope field occur on a much slower time scale than the time scale necessary for the field to complete one round - trip in the resonator . in a typical wgm resonator with @xmath247 radius ,",
    "the round trip time is @xmath248 , while the time scale on which the nonlinearity and the pump field produce significant effects on the field envelope is in the @xmath249 or @xmath250 range .",
    "hence , once the time derivative of the field envelopes is calculated using eq .",
    "( a.10 ) , the nonlinear terms and pump terms in eq .",
    "( a.16 ) can be averaged over the azimuthal coordinate @xmath11 from @xmath251 to @xmath101 .",
    "hence , all the terms proportional to @xmath252 $ ] , with @xmath253 , do not effectively contribute to the process because they average to zero and can be neglected .",
    "third , we approximate the overlap integrals as follows : @xmath254 and @xmath255 , consistent with the weak dependence of the radial field profiles on the azimuthal number . moreover , in the pump term we simplify @xmath256 and @xmath257 , and we introduce the detuning of the pump field with respect to the dominant modes , @xmath13 .",
    "fourth , we expand @xmath258 and @xmath259 around @xmath260 and keep only the lowest order .",
    "finally , we collect the nonlinear terms oscillating with the same detuning and retain only the nonlinear terms whose frequency detuning vanishes , _",
    "i.e. _ , we only retain the frequency - matched terms @xmath261 .",
    "we then obtain two incoherently coupled , externally driven , damped , generalized nlses or lles @xmath1 @xmath262 \\notag\\ ] ] @xmath263 where @xmath264 @xmath265\\,dv\\ : , \\tag{a.18}\\ ] ] are the overlap integrals of the interacting modes .",
