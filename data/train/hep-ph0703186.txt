    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is the presently accepted theory of strong interactions among quarks and gluons .",
    "perturbative qcd has been developed in great detail and tested successfully .",
    "however , the physics of the nonperturbative qcd seems to be a much more difficult task . the rapid development of the lattice",
    "qcd theory may offer some answers to the nonperturbative dynamics .",
    "in addition to normal mesons ( @xmath5 ) and baryons ( @xmath6 ) , which can be built up from the naive quark model , qcd allows the existence of exotic states which can be glueballs , hybrid mesons ( the bound states of @xmath7 ) , tetraquark mesons ( the bound states of @xmath8 ) , and other multi - parton states .",
    "these exotic states , which go beyond the description of the naive quark model , can offer the direct evidence concerning confining properties of qcd .    in the past years",
    "possible evidences have accumulated for the existence of @xmath0 exotic states @xcite .",
    "now we have two @xmath0 exotic states below 2 gev .",
    "a negatively charged exotic state , @xmath9 , with @xmath10 was observed in @xmath11 @xcite and in @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the corresponding neutral state was reported by the crystal barrel @xcite and e852 @xcite collaborations in the reactions of @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively , where the decay channel @xmath15 is isovector and hence can not be confused with a glueball . unlike the charged @xmath16 channel , the charge conjugate is a good quantum number in the neutral @xmath17 system , where the @xmath18 was detected in its @xmath19 decay mode @xcite and very recently in its @xmath20 decay mode in the e852 experiment @xcite .",
    "the advantage of detecting the @xmath21 mode over the all - neutral final state is that the decaying vertex is determined by charged tracks .",
    "the mass of the neutral exotic @xmath0 state observed in the very recent e852 experiment is @xmath22  mev @xcite , which is lower than the mass @xmath23  mev in the crystal barrel measurement .",
    "the world average is @xmath24  mev @xcite .",
    "another observed @xmath0 exotic state , @xmath25 , has also attracted much attention .",
    "in contrast to @xmath9 , the @xmath26 coupling of this state is unexpectedly stronger than the @xmath15 coupling although the phase space favors the latter .",
    "due to the above property , it was argued that the @xmath27 may be favored for a four - quark state , while the @xmath28 may be a hybrid meson @xcite .",
    "theoretically , the compositions of observed @xmath0 exotic states remain unclear . the flux - tube model @xcite and lattice calculations @xcite",
    "predict the lowest - lying @xmath0 hybrid meson to have a mass of about 1.9  gev .",
    "moreover , the former predicts that the @xmath0 hybrid meson are dominated by @xmath29 and @xmath30 decays in contrast with the @xmath25 experimental results where the three final states @xmath31 and @xmath32 are of comparable strength , @xmath33 @xcite .    to evaluate the mass of the lowest - lying @xmath0 hybrid meson in the qcd sum rule approach , in the literature , people used @xmath34 as the relevant interpolating current in the calculation of the two - point correlation function .",
    "the earliest qcd sum rule calculations were done in refs .",
    "@xcite , where the radiative corrections and anomalous dimensions of @xmath35 and some operators in operator - product - expansion ( ope ) series were not known . to obtain more precise estimate , the radiative corrections , which are sizable ,",
    "were then computed in refs .",
    "unfortunately , the mass sum rule result is highly sensitive to the parameter @xmath36 which models the threshold of the excited states , and does not show @xmath36 stability .",
    "thus , jin and krner conservatively estimate that the mass of the lowest - lying @xmath0 hybrid meson is larger than @xmath37  gev @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , chetyrkin and narison argue that @xmath36 may lie between @xmath38 gev@xmath39 and @xmath40 gev@xmath39 , so that the mass of the lowest - lying @xmath0 hybrid meson is about @xmath41 gev @xcite .",
    "to clarify the inconsistences in the literature , in the present work , we study the mass of the lowest - lying @xmath0 hybrid meson using the qcd sum rule technique . instead of @xmath35 , we will use @xmath42 here and in what follows , @xmath43 is a light - like vector , which satisfies @xmath44 .",
    "so far no people adopt the above current to study the mass of the so - called hybrid meson .",
    "the reason that we use @xmath45 is because the residue for @xmath45 coupling to the @xmath0 hybrid meson determines the normalization of the twist-3 light - cone distribution amplitude ( lcda ) of the lowest - lying @xmath0 meson , while , for @xmath35 , the residue corresponds to the normalization of twist-4 lcda . for a relevant reaction ,",
    "the amplitude related to @xmath35 is relatively suppressed by @xmath46 , as compared with that due to @xmath45 , where @xmath47 corresponds to the scale of the reaction and @xmath48 is the mass of the @xmath0 meson .",
    "thus @xmath45 may be more suitable to use to study the lowest - lying @xmath0 meson than @xmath35 .",
    "note that the renormalization(rg)-improvement is always necessary in the method of qcd sum rules because the hadronic mass is determined by the maximum stability of the sum rule within the borel window , where the borel mass is actually the renormalization scale .",
    "unlike the vector current @xmath49 which satisfies the current conservation and is scale - independent , @xmath45 as well as @xmath35 is a scale - dependent operator , similar to the baryonic cases @xcite , and its anomalous dimension may result in significant improvement in the qcd sum rule result .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : qcd ] , we make a brief description of lcdas for the @xmath0 exotic meson in language of the qcd field theory .",
    "the lcdas play an essential rle in the qcd description of hard exclusive processes . using the qcd sum rule technique and adopting the current @xmath45 , in sec .",
    "[ sec : sumrule ] we are devoted to the calculation of the mass sum rule of the lowest - lying @xmath0 meson . to clarify the discrepancy between our result and those given in the literature , we revisit the previous qcd sum rule studies in sec .",

    "[ sec : conclusion ] contains the conclusions and discussions .",
    "unlike the model - building approach , a @xmath0 exotic meson in language of the qcd field theory is described in terms of a set of fock states for which each state has the same quantum number as the exotic meson : @xmath50 where @xmath51 are distribution amplitudes and the dots denote the higher fock states .",
    "in contrast to the usual intuition of people , actually a nonlocal @xmath52 does not vanish and is antisymmetric under interchange of momentum fractions of @xmath53 and @xmath54 in su(3 ) limit .",

    "this property was first used in the study of the deep exclusive electro - production involving a lowest - lying @xmath0 exotic meson @xcite . in analogy to the leading lcdas , all twist - three two - parton lcdas for a @xmath0 exotic meson are also antisymmetric under interchange @xmath63 in su(3 ) limit due to the g - parity .",
    "@xmath66 can be non - vanishing under interchange of momentum fractions of quarks . similar to the case of vector mesons @xcite , using non - local 3-parton gauge - invariant operators to project amplitudes of the @xmath67 , we have three twist-3 3-parton lcdas for a @xmath0 exotic meson , built up by a quark , an antiquark , and a gluon , where two of lcdas are symmetric under interchange of momentum fractions of the quark and antiquark in the su(3 ) limit , while one is antisymmetric .",

    "the method of qcd sum rule approaches the bound state problem in qcd from the perturbative region , where non - perturbative quantities , such as some condensates , may contribute significant corrections in the ope series . through the study of the relevant correlation function and the idea of the quark - hadron duality , the corresponding hadronic properties , like masses , decay constants , form factors , etc .",

    "our final result will indicate that one of the two lowest - lying states is @xmath75 and the other one is the lowest - lying @xmath0 meson , i.e. , the mass of the latter is lower than that of the @xmath76 , the first excited state in the @xmath73 channel .",
    "we approximate the correlation function as @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the ope result at the quark - gluon level , and @xmath36 is the threshold of higher resonances .",

    "@xcite did not perform the sum rule analysis as we do here . to improve further the @xmath81 range of the derived qcd sum rules , we consider the @xmath81 dependence of the various terms using the rg equation .",
