    "the presence of such an experimental test bed has led to a plethora of new theoretical studies on the model @xcite .",

    "recently , it has been realized that such ultracold bosonic systems also allow us easy access to the non - equilibrium dynamics of its constituent atoms near the mi - sf quantum critical point .",
    "the theoretical study of such quantum dynamics on various models has seen great progress in recent years @xcite .",
    "most of these works have either restricted themselves to the physics of integrable and/or one - dimensional ( 1d ) models or concentrated on generic scaling behavior of physical observable for sudden or slow dynamics through a quantum critical point @xcite . however",
    "quantum dynamics of specific experimentally realizable non - integrable models in higher spatial dimensions and strong coupling regime has not been studied extensively mainly due to the difficulty in handling quantum dynamics of plethora of states in the system s hilbert space . the bose - hubbard model with on - site interaction strength @xmath4 and nearest neighbor hopping amplitude @xmath3 , which provides an accurate description for ultracold bosons in an optical lattice , constitutes an example of such models .",
    "most of the studies on dynamics of this model have concentrated on @xmath16 @xcite , weak coupling regime @xcite , and mean - field order parameter dynamics following a sudden ramp in the strong coupling regime @xcite .",
    "recent experiments @xcite clearly necessitate computation of dynamical evolution of several other quantities in higher dimensional bose - hubbard model in the strong - coupling regime ( @xmath17 ) beyond the mean - field theory and for arbitrary ramp time @xmath8 .",

    "more recently , the authors of ref .   have developed a theoretical formalism which enables one to analyze the dynamics of the bose - hubbard model beyond mean - field theory near the mi - sf critical point @xcite .",
    "the method uses a projection operator technique which enables us to account for the quantum fluctuations over the mean - field theory perturbatively in @xmath18(@xmath19 ) and therefore yields accurate results as long @xmath20 for sudden(ramp ) dynamics .",
    "this allows one to treat sudden and slow ramps at equal footing near the mi - sf quantum critical point . as shown in ref .",
    ", the projection operator method yields an accurate phase diagram and also provides an estimate of dynamically generated defect density which shows a qualitatively reasonable match with recent experimental results @xcite . in the present work ,",

    "first , we present a generic phase diagram of the bose - hubbard model as a function of the lattice coordination number @xmath0 and compare these results to the available qmc data for several one- , two- , and three - dimensional lattices .",
    "our comparison demonstrates that the accuracy of the projection operator technique increases with @xmath0 reaching about @xmath1 of the qmc data for lattices with @xmath2 .",
    "second , we compute the excitation spectrum using our approach and show that it yields the gapless bogoliubov and gapped amplitude modes in the sf phase and the gapped particle and hole excitation modes in the mi phase .",
    "third , we study the dynamics of the model for non - linear ramp of the hopping parameter @xmath3 from @xmath6 to @xmath7 characterized by a ramp time @xmath8 and exponent @xmath9 : @xmath21 . we compute the fidelity susceptibility @xmath11 , nearest - neighbor correlation between the bosons @xmath22 ,",
    "the defect formation probability @xmath15 , and the residual energy @xmath12 of the system following such a protocol and show that our result reproduce those of ref .   for @xmath23 as a special case .",
    "we also find the value of the optimal @xmath9 which leads to minimal defect production for fast quenches ( small @xmath8 ) .",
    "finally , we also compute the order parameter @xmath13 , the order - parameter correlation function @xmath14 , the wavefunction overlap @xmath11 , and the residual energy @xmath12 subsequent to a sudden quench , discuss their properties , and provide explicit analytical expressions for @xmath13 and @xmath12 .",
    "we also provide a detailed comparison of the behavior of @xmath13 with that obtained from gutzwiller mean - field theory .",
    "the plan of the rest of the work is the following .",
    "in sec.[eqsec ] , we develop the projection operator formalism and apply it to obtain the equilibrium phase diagram of the bose - hubbard model for arbitrary @xmath0 and compute its excitation spectrum .",
