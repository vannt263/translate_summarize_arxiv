    "<S> we report a detailed investigation of the quasiparticle ( qp ) recombination lifetime , @xmath2 , as a function of temperature and magnetic field in underdoped hgba@xmath3cuo@xmath4 ( hg-1201 ) and yba@xmath3cu@xmath5o@xmath6 ( ybco ) single crystals by ultrafast time - resolved reflectivity . </S>",

    "<S> the near - degeneracy of the characteristic temperatures of cdw and sc phases suggests that these two order parameters are related , as opposed to simply coexisting and competing . </S>",
    "<S> several theoretical works have suggested that the same short - range antiferromagnetic fluctuations drive the formation of cdw and sc states  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> sc quasiparticles are phase - coherent linear superpositions of normal state electrons and holes , while cdw quasiparticles are superpositions of electrons ( or holes ) .    our experiments probe quasiparticle states in underdoped cuprates through time - resolved measurements of their lifetime against recombination , whereby two quasiparticles of opposite spin re - pair and scatter into the condensate . as we discuss below , this scattering rate is sensitive to the phase - coherence of quasiparticle superposition states . to measure the recombination lifetime </S>",

    "<S> this correlation leads us to conclude that , although the density of states depression known as the pseudogap is formed at a higher temperature , the cdw either enhances it , or leads to a new gap of different origin . a correlation between cdw and gap formation </S>",

    "<S> we proposed that this peak in @xmath2 indicates a crossover from fluctuating cdw to sc / cdw order , occurring as the condensate coherence time slides through the time window set by the background recombination time @xmath91 2 - 3 ps . </S>",
