    "gravitational clustering from initial conditions has provided one of the classic problems in cosmology . to achieve a self - similar evolution , according to peebles ( 1980 ) and efstathiou et al.(1988 ) , two conditions must be fulfilled : ( 1 ) the background cosmology should not contain any characteristic scales , thus the universe must be an einstein - de sitter one , and ( 2 ) the initial density field should have no characteristic length scale , thus its initial power spectrum must be a power law .    for a self - similar clustering pattern ,",
    "its physical properties remain the same during its evolution when the length scale @xmath13 is scaled by a characteristic scale @xmath14 .",
    "a simple choice of @xmath14 for a self - similar clustering is the scale at which the fluctuations begin to become non - linear , i.e. , the variance of the linear density field smoothed on this scale is unity , @xmath15 the variance is defined by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the fourier transform of a window function(usually a top hat or gaussian ) , @xmath18 is the contribution to the fractional density variance per unit @xmath19 ( @xmath20 is a normalization volume ) , and @xmath21 is the expansion scale factor . for the scale - free initial power spectrum , @xmath22 , the characteristic scale satisfies @xmath23 the characteristic wavenumber @xmath24 can be chosen to be @xmath25 , so @xmath26 . with the characteristic scale @xmath14 ,",
    "all statistical measures of the density field can be expressed as a similarity solution that is independent of time @xmath27 ( peebles 1980 ; efstathiou et al .",
    "1988 ; colombi , bouchet , & hernquist 1996 ; jain & bertschinger 1998 ) .",
    "we study the scale - free models that assume an einstein - de sitter universe ( i.e. @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) , and a power - law @xmath30 with @xmath12 being @xmath31 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 respectively for the linear density power spectrum .",
    "for each model , we have one simulation of @xmath11 particles that was produced by one of the authors ( ypj ) .",
    "the current simulations are constructed in a similar way as the scale - free simulation sample in jing ( 1998 ) , but have higher force and mass resolutions .",
    "they were generated with a parallel - vectorized @xmath32 ( i.e. particle particle particle mesh ) code ( jing & suto 2002 ) at the national astronomical observatory of japan .",
    "the gravitational force is softened with the @xmath33 form of hockney and eastwood ( 1981 ) with the softening parameter @xmath34 ( @xmath35 is the simulation box size ) , so the force becomes newtonian when the separation is larger than @xmath36 .",

    "the density field can be represented by a dimensionless field @xmath41 ( which is usually referred to as the density contrast ) @xmath42 based on the cosmological principle , we expect @xmath39 to be periodic in some large rectangular volume @xmath20 .",
    "its fourier transformation is then defined by @xmath43    the density field of the simulation is periodic at the box size @xmath35 .",
    "the requirement of periodicity restricts the allowed wavenumbers to harmonic boundary conditions @xmath44 with similar expressions for @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",

    "there are many ways to express the shape of a triangle .",

    "it is inefficient to use eq .",
    "( [ fourdeltadir ] ) to compute the fourier transformation for a simulation where both @xmath67 and the mode number considered are large .",
    "here we use the fast fourier transform ( fft ) technique to compute @xmath68 . in this case",
    ", there is an upper limit for @xmath69 that is imposed by the finite sampling of the density field at the fft mesh points , which is called the nyquist wavenumber , @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the mesh spacing and @xmath72 is the dimension of the mesh . then the power spectrum and bispectrum can be estimated through averaging all modes of which the wavenumbers @xmath73 in thin shells ( @xmath74 , @xmath75 , i=1 , 2 , 3 ) satisfy eq .",

    "as shown in jing ( 1992 ; 2004 ) , the mass assignment onto a grid for fft has two effects : the smoothing effect and the sampling effect .",
    "the smoothing effect has been considered by many authors in previous bistpectrum measurements ( e.g. scoccimarro et al .",
    "1998 , their appendix ) , but the sampling effect has not . because both effects are coupled , the smoothing effect can not be fully corrected if the sampling effect is not considered .",
    "these effects must be taken into account for a precision analysis such as the current work .",
    "first , the particle distribution must be sampled at the fft grid points . here",
    "we adopt the nearest - grid - point ( ngp ) ( efstathiou et al .",
    "1985 ) approximation to assign the particle mass to the grid .",
    "this generally leads to a smoothing of the density field on the scale of @xmath85 in the coordinate space .",
    "higher order mass assignment schemes , e.g. cloud - in - cell ( cic ) or triangular shaped cloud ( tsc ) , can not avoid the smoothing issue either ; in fact they increase the smoothing even to a larger scale . in the next subsection",
    ", we will show that the mass assignment with ngp has the smoothing effect for @xmath86 which essentially limits the usable fourier modes to @xmath87 . for a 3d fft with @xmath88 , @xmath4",
    "is thus limited to @xmath89 that is not enough for fully exploring the non - linear properties .",
    "a much bigger @xmath72 would require a huge computer resource for the fft computation .",
    "in the next section , we will show that we can overcome this problem effectively with a 2d fft .",
    "when measuring the power spectrum and bispectrum from a simulation we must take account for the numerical artifacts , such as the discreteness effect , the finite box size , and the force softening .",
    "these limit the dynamical range of the simulation , and thus affect the measured power spectrum and bispectrum .",
    "other important effect is that introduced by the fft . here",
    "we will address how to correct and/or account for these numerical artifacts .",
    "since the power spectrum and bispectrum are measured from simulations with a finite number of particles , we need to correct for the discreteness effect arising from the poisson shot noise . according to peebles ( 1980 ) ,",
    "we divide the volume @xmath90 into infinitesimal elements @xmath91 with @xmath92 objects inside @xmath93 .",
    "the over - density can be written as : @xmath94 ( @xmath95 is the mean number density ) , and its fourier transformation can be expressed as : @xmath96 where @xmath97 , is the number of particles in @xmath90 .",
    "since @xmath93 is taken so small that @xmath92 is either 0 or 1 , we have @xmath98 .    for the power spectrum",
    ", we can find the ensemble average of @xmath99 which reads : @xmath100 finally , we get the desired result : @xmath101    > from eq .",
    "( [ powedesctete ] ) we know that the discreteness ( or shot noise ) effect gives an additional term @xmath102 to the power spectrum .",
    "we can correct for the shot noise in the power spectrum easily .",
    "in analogy with the power spectrum , we write the bispectrum : @xmath103+{1 \\over n^2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the bispectrum with the shot noise removed can be expressed as : @xmath104-{1 \\over n^2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      in the simulation , in order to suppress two - body encounters , a softening must be applied when calculating the gravitational interaction .",
    "this induces an error in the integration of particle trajectories at small scale .",
    "we must impose some constraint on the scale below which the numerical effect dominates the clustering in the simulation .",
    "the cutoff can be a few times of the softening length .",
    "the box size of the simulation is finite , so there is no clustering power beyond the simulation box . on one hand",
    ", this results in a limited number of fourier modes at @xmath105 which can influence the accuracy of measuring the clustering spectra . on the other hand",
    ", this large - scale cutoff may also affect the clustering on scale much smaller than the box size , because the coupling between different scales can be important on non - linear and quasilinear scales .",
    "both the force softening and the box - size cutoff are expected to break down the scaling property of the self - similar evolution .",
    "we will use the expected scaling to quantify these numerical artifacts .      when doing the fft , we first need to collect density values on grids ( usually called mass assignment ) .",
    "the mass assignment in fact is equivalent to convolving the density field by one chosen function @xmath106 and sampling the convolved density on a finite number of grid points , therefore the fft of @xmath107 generally is not equal to the ft of @xmath108 . in this work",
    ", we have adopted the ngp ( the nearest grid point ) scheme to assign particles to the mesh . the finite sampling of the convolved density results in the summation of the aliased power spectrum or bispectrum .",
    "we can correct the alias effect on the power spectrum through a theoretical calculation ( jing 1992 , 2004 ; baugh & efstathiou 1994 ; smith et al .",
    "but it is complicated to correct for the alias effect on the bispectrum through a theoretical calculation .",
    "fortunately , we find that the 2d statistical properties are identical to the 3d statistical properties in fourier space (  5 ) .",
    "thus we can make use of the 2d density field instead of the 3d density field when calculating the bispectrum at small scales , because the 2d fft needs less computer memory than the 3d case .",
    "in fact , the larger number of grid points @xmath72 for the fft , the smaller scale where the alias effect takes place . the 2d fft can overcome the limitation of the computation and involve little alias effect .",
    "thus we can extend the measurement of the bispectrum to very small scales with little numerical artifact .",

    "peacock & dodds ( 1996 ) examined a large set of scale - free models and cdm models , and obtained a accurate fitting formula for the power spectrum which agrees with the results of n - body simulations .",
    "motivated by their work , we find that the ratio of the measured bispectrum to the weakly non - linear bispectrum ( the second - order pt ) has interesting properties , especially the behavior of @xmath148 ( @xmath149 )",
    ". a few typical examples of @xmath148 are shown in figures  [ ratio2910 ] , [ ratio2920 ] and [ ratio2930 ] ( the open symbols ) for the three models with @xmath150 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 . from these results",
    "we expect that the relation between the weakly non - linear bispectrum and the nonlinear bispectrum can be expressed as : @xmath151 where @xmath12 satisfies @xmath152 . at linear scales",
    "@xmath153 , and @xmath154 takes an asymptotic form as @xmath155 in the linear regime . from the measured @xmath148 , we can find that @xmath148 as a function of @xmath57 is approximated by a gaussian function .",
    "its difference from the gaussian function is dependent on the triangle shape , scale and spectral index @xmath12 .",
    "taking into account of these factors , we propose the following form for @xmath156 : @xmath157 where @xmath158 are : @xmath159kr_0 \\ } [ ( 0.1 - 0.3n)v+0.4],\\nonumber\\\\ a_2(kr_0,v , n)&=&0.5 + 0.2v , \\nonumber\\\\ a_3(kr_0,v , n)&= & [ 1.-{2 \\over \\exp(0.5kr_0)+1}+(0.01nv+0.001)kr_0]0.04+\\nonumber\\\\ & & 0.06v+0.1^{(1-n ) } , \\nonumber\\\\ a_4(kr_0,v , n ) & = & \\{1.1+[(n^2)^{1.3}0.05 - 0.2]\\tanh(2kr_0)+0.15\\exp(-(0.3kr_0)^2)+\\nonumber\\\\ & & ( 0.01-{0.05 - 0.035v\\over 4v+2})kr_0\\}/[1+(0.4 - 0.2v)^{1+kr_0 } ] , \\nonumber\\\\ a_6(kr_0,v , n ) & = & [ 0.8-{2 \\over \\exp((0.5-n)kr_0)+1}+(0.01 - 0.005/(v+0.1))kr_0 ]   \\nonumber\\\\ & & [ 2-{0.3 \\over v+0.1}]+0.2n\\tanh(2kr_0 - 1 ) , \\nonumber\\\\ a_5(kr_0,v , n ) & = & -0.7a_6(kr_0,v , n),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath160 is the hyperbolic function .    we have obtained the best - fitting parameters in @xmath158 by doing a @xmath161 minimization between the predicted and measured bispectrum for all triangles . in figures  [ ratio2910 ] , [ ratio2920 ] and [ ratio2930 ] we compare the best fitting function @xmath154 with our measured @xmath148 .",
    "the figures show that the fitting formula ( [ fittingfnl ] ) works very well for @xmath152 , for all triangle shapes , and for all scales ( characterized by @xmath162 ) studied . with the function @xmath154",
    ", we can convert the weakly non - linear bispectrum into the non - linear bispectrum . in figures",
    "[ fitting2910 ] , [ fitting2920 ] and [ fitting2930 ] we compare our measured reduced bispectra with the prediction of our fitting formula .",
    "there we also plot the prediction of the fitting formula of sf99 . from the figures , one can see that the fitting formula obtained in this paper can accurately match the simulation results , much better than the formula of sf99 .    to quantify the accuracy of our fitting formula",
    ", we plot the percentage of the deviation @xmath163 in figures  [ erro2910 ] , [ erro2920 ] and [ erro2930 ] .",
    "the deviation is defined as : @xmath164 where @xmath165 is the prediction of our fitting formula , and @xmath166 is the reduced bispectrum measured from the simulations .",
    "similarly we also estimate the accuracy of the fitting formula of sf99 that is also shown in the figures .",
    "the figures show that our fitting formula can match the measured results typically at an accuracy of 10 percent .",
    "the deviation is slightly larger , about @xmath167 , when @xmath168 and @xmath169 , which could be attributed to some stochastic fluctuation in @xmath166 for the limited number of k - triangles in the configuration .",
    "we also see that the deviation for the sf99 formula is much larger , almost about 50 percent in the strongly nonlinear regime .",
    "although we only have a single realization for these simulations , we measured the bispectrum for two or three outputs scaled according to the similarity solution .",
    "we regard each output as a realization , and estimate the errors of the bispectra from the different outputs .",
    "we also have taken the projections along different axes as independent realizations when we estimate errors for the 2d bispectra . in figures",
    "[ fitting2910 ] , [ fitting2920 ] and [ fitting2930 ] , the error bars are estimated with this method .",
    "in this paper , we have accurately measured the bispectrum for four scale - free models .",
    "the measurement is based on a new method that can effectively eliminate the alias and numerical artifacts , and reliably extend the analysis into the strongly non - linear regime .",
    "the work also makes use of a set of state - of - the art n - body simulations of scale - free hierarchical models that have a significantly larger dynamical range than the previous studies . with these measured results",
    ", we demonstrated that the measured bispectrum depends on the shape and size of @xmath4-triangle even in the strongly nonlinear regime .",
    "it increases with wavenumber and decreases with the spectral index .",
    "these results are consistent with that those found for the three - point correlation for cdm models ( jing & brner 1998 , ma & fry 2000 , scoccimarro & couchman 2001 , scoccimarro et al . 2001b , takada & jain 2003a ) , but are in contrast with the hypothesis that @xmath64 is a constant in the strongly non - linear regime ( sf99 ) .",
    "we also show that the fitting formula of sf99 does not describe our simulation results well , with a typical error about 40 percent . in the end",
    ", we present a new fitting formula for the reduced bispectrum that is valid for @xmath152 with a typical error of @xmath6 percent only .    our new method for measuring the bispectra is to use the property that the 2d power spectrum and bispectrum are identical to the 3d ones .",
    "this property can be easily proved and has been tested with our n - body simulations . as the 2d fft requires less computer memory than the 3d fft , we can extend our analysis of the bispectrum into very small scales with little computer limitation .",
    "we also use the scaling properties of the scale - free models to correct for all known numerical artifacts and to identify those regimes where the bispectra can reliably measured .",
    "although we have obtained an empirical formula of the bispectrum for scale - free models of the spectral index @xmath149 , some issues need to be addressed in future work .",
    "one obvious aspect is that the formula does not work for @xmath0 , because the tree - level pt can not predict the weakly non - linear bispectrum for this model .",
    "fortunately the slope of the power spectrum in cdm models , which are the most plausible theory for the structure formation in the universe , is in the range @xmath2 to @xmath170 at the non - linear scales .",
    "therefore , we may generalize our fitting formula to cdm models by considering the change of the power spectrum slope with scale as well as the deviation from the einstein - de sitter model .",
    "we will study the bispectrum in cdm models in a future paper .",
    "another issue is that our fitting formula is purely empirical .",
    "considering that our measured @xmath64 results are in good agreement with the one - loop pt prediction in the quasilinear regime ( scoccimarro et al .",
    "1998 ) and that the halo model can successfully match the three - point correlation function in the strongly non - linear regime ( takada & jain 2003a ) , we think it would be possible to combine these theoretical predictions to find a more theory - oriented fitting formula for @xmath64 .",
