    "since the discovery of the correlation between the mass of the galactic bulge in galaxies and the mass of their central black holes @xcite , understanding the link between the formation and evolution of massive galaxies and their supermassive black holes ( smbh ; 10@xmath15 - 10@xmath16msun ) has become one of the most important problems in both galaxy formation and extreme astrophysics .",
    "the realisation that an active smbh or active galactic nucleus ( agn ) plays a fundamental role in determining the final stellar mass of the galactic bulge has wide implications , and has led to to the ubiquitous adoption of agn _ feedback _ in many galaxy formation models @xcite . without agn feedback , these galaxy formation models can not reproduce the observed number counts of the most massive galaxies .    in cosmological simulations",
    "the most massive galaxies in the universe are assembled at high redshift through gas - rich mergers of smaller systems @xcite .",
    "the merger is expected to induce a far infrared ( fir ) luminous starburst , which enshrouds the galaxy in dust therefore obscuring it completely at ultraviolet ( uv ) and optical wavelengths .",
    "the high gas densities in the merging starburst feed accretion onto the central black hole , which is initially also dust obscured . as radiative pressure on the dust grains begins to clear the dust and gas away during the _ blowout _ phase @xcite , the central active galactic nucleus ( agn ) is revealed as a uv - luminous quasar .",
    "several indirect lines of evidence suggest that powerful starbursts and luminous quasars occur in the same galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , direct observational evidence for starburst galaxies at high redshifts transitioning to uv - luminous quasars , has remained elusive .    in @xcite - b12,b13",
    "hereafter - we used infrared surveys to identify 14 extremely massive , luminous , dusty broad - line quasars at @xmath17 that could represent galaxies caught during the agn blowout phase .",
    "this new population of quasars is too dusty to be present in optical surveys like the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) that have so far been used to identify the most luminous quasars in the universe .",
    "the reddest and most intrinsically luminous quasar in our current sample is ulasj1234 + 0907 at @xmath0 .",
    "our spectroscopic observations in b12 detected very broad h@xmath18 emission from this quasar signifying the presence of an extremely massive smbh ( @xmath19m@xmath4 ) and/or significant outflows that could be broadening the h@xmath18 line .",
    "this broad emission line also supports the interpretation that the dust responsible for the red colours of the quasar , originates on large scales within the quasar host , rather than in a molecular torus . in the latter case",
    ", our view of the quasar broad - line region would have also been blocked for most lines of sight .",
    "the dust extinction implied by our sed fit to the broadband colours of ulasj1234 + 0907 , is @xmath20 mags even accounting for the effect of the large h@xmath18 equivalent width on the @xmath21 colour ( see b12 for details ) .",
    "if ulasj1234 + 0907 is being observed in the agn blowout phase , the next step is to look for evidence for a massive starburst quasar host . in this paper , we present detailed multi - wavelength observations of this quasar .",
    "x - ray observations with _ xmm - newton _ allow us to directly detect the primary accreting power source while far infrared and submillimeter observations with _ herschel _ and scuba-2 are used to place the first constraints on the quasar host galaxy . throughout this paper",
    "we assume a flat @xmath22cdm cosmology .",
    "all magnitudes are on the ab system with conversion from the vega system using zeropoint offsets for ukidss and _ wise _ photometry from @xcite and @xcite",
    "we conducted @xmath23-band imaging of the quasar using the wide - field camera on the 2.5 m isaac newton telescope in april and may 2008 the total exposure time was 85 minutes .",
    "the six individual exposures were reduced , stacked and photometrically calibrated onto the sdss @xmath24 system following @xcite .",
    "ulasj1234 + 0907 was undetected in the stacked @xmath23-band image ( figure [ fig : cutouts ] ) with a 5@xmath25 magnitude limit of 25.15 giving an @xmath26 colour of @xmath87.1 .",
    "ulasj1234 + 0907 is therefore among the reddest extragalactic sources known .",
    "figure 2 of b12 shows the @xmath26 colours of various well - known extremely red objects .",
    "the reddest quasar from that figure : pksj0132 which was the reddest quasar previously known @xcite has an @xmath26=4.2 , almost 3 mags bluer than ulasj1234 + 0907 .",
    "we conducted @xmath27 band observations of ulasj1234 + 0907 using the isaac camera on the very large telescope .",

    "the mos detectors are less sensitive but the spectrum obtained from these is consistent with figure [ fig : x - ray ] .",
    "we fit a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) model to the observed photometry of ulasj1234 + 0907 summarised in table [ tab : flux ] . fitting the sed in the far infrared",
    "requires us to disentangle the contribution of the agn and the starburst to the total infrared luminosity .",
    "we adopt two approaches for the sed fitting .",
    "firstly , we use the publicly available sed fitting code cigale @xcite , which allows us to fit for both the agn and starburst components at infrared wavelengths . in this code",
    ", the fractional contribution of the agn to the total infrared luminosity is left as a free parameter in the fitting .",
    "the code uses the semi - empirical models of @xcite to model the dust emission at infrared wavelengths .",
    "agn templates can additionally be incorporated and we adopt 32 agn templates from the library of @xcite , encompassing a range of torus opening angles , density parameters , optical depths and outer and inner radii of the dust clouds .",
    "we note that the inclusion of other agn templates available within cigale , does not significantly change our results .",
    "our second approach is simpler with fewer free parameters and allows direct comparison with greybody fits to the seds of other high redshift galaxy populations .",
    "we use the code developed by @xcite to fit a single temperature greybody and a power - law of the form @xmath38 , to model the mid infrared emission at rest - frame wavelengths @xmath393@xmath32 m .",
    "the power - law approximates the contribution from an agn - heated warm dust component .    using the cigale fit we find that the total infrared luminosity is log@xmath2(l@xmath40)=13.90@xmath50.02 with the agn contribution to this ir luminosity fit to be 62@xmath54% .",
    "the starburst luminosity is therefore log@xmath2(l@xmath41)=13.5@xmath50.1 which translates to a star formation rate of @xmath364500@xmath42 m@xmath4yr@xmath9 using the @xcite relation : @xmath43 despite the agn dominating the infrared dust emission , the sed fitting indicates that this agn can not account for all of the infrared emission and the host galaxy of ulasj1234 + 0907 must also be forming stars at a prodigious rate . with an inferred starburst luminosity of @xmath44 , it can be classified as a hyperluminous infrared galaxy or hylirg .    in the case of the single greybody fit ,",
    "we fix the dust emissivity index to @xmath7 @xcite due to a lack of photometric data over the rayleigh - jeans tail of the sed .",
    "the free parameters are the power - law slope , @xmath18 in the mir as well as the dust temperature .",
    "although the agn is expected to dominate the total infra - red luminosity , the far infra - red luminosity between 40 - 300@xmath32 m can safely be attributed to a starburst @xcite .",
    "we integrate our best - fit single greybody sed between 40 and 300@xmath32 m and use this as a conservative estimate of the total amount of star formation .",
    "the infrared luminosity between 40 - 300@xmath32 m , l@xmath45l@xmath4 corresponding to a star formation rate of @xmath362000@xmath46 m@xmath4yr@xmath9 .",
    "the mid infra - red power law slope is relatively shallow : @xmath18=1.03@xmath50.03 , which is consistent with the presence of a significant warm dust component from agn heated dust .",
    "the best - fit cold dust temperature is also significantly higher than seen in most submillimeter galaxies : t@xmath6=60@xmath53k .",
    "the corresponding dust - mass is log@xmath2(m@xmath47/m@xmath4)=@xmath48 .     in units of @xmath49 .",
    "the dashed line is the best - fit cigale sed which includes both agn and starburst components while the solid line denotes the simple greybody plus mid - ir power - law fit to the data .",
    "we also show the seds of mrk231 from @xcite ( dot - dashed line ) and the high luminosity agn from @xcite ( dotted line ) .",
    "all seds have been scaled to match the rest - frame flux density of ulasj1234 + 0907 at @xmath366@xmath32 m which corresponds to the observed - frame _ wise _",
    "22@xmath32 m band . ]    in figure [ fig : sed ] , we also show the sed of the archetypal starburst / agn composite galaxy mrk231 in the local universe which has been scaled to have the same flux density as ulasj1234 + 0907 at a rest - frame wavelength of 6@xmath32 m .",
    "finally we plot the composite far infrared sed of the high luminosity ( log(@xmath50 ) x - ray agn from @xcite again scaled to ulasj1234 + 0907 at a rest - frame wavelength of 6@xmath32 m .",
    "ulasj1234 + 0907 has a higher mid to far infra - red flux ratio than mrk231 .",
    "the pure agn sed on the other hand , drops rapidly at rest - frame wavelengths of @xmath3940@xmath32 m whereas the sed of ulasj1234 + 0907 extends to longer wavelengths and only begins to drop off at @xmath3660@xmath32 m .",
    "this excess cool dust emission relative to pure agn , could again be indicative of a starburst component .",
    "further evidence for star formation is provided by the fact that the observed 500@xmath32 m photometric data - point is not particularly well - fit by the models and lies above the model seds . at the redshift of this quasar ,",
    "the [ cii ] cooling line is in the spire 500@xmath32 m band and can increase the broadband flux by 20 - 40% @xcite .",
    "our observations can not directly rule out the presence of agn heated cool dust distributed at larger radii from the central black - hole than the hotter dust responsible for the mid infrared emission .",
    "however , many fir luminous quasars at high redshift have been demonstrated to contain significant reservoirs of molecular gas , which is unambiguous evidence for star formation @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we demonstrate below using x - ray observations of the quasar , that the agn bolometric luminosity inferred independently from the x - ray , is significantly lower than the total infra - red luminosity measured for this object .",
    "this once again hints that some additional source of heating apart from the agn , may be responsible for the reprocessed far infra - red dust - emission .",
    "regardless of the origin of the cool dust emission in the far infrared , we conclude that ulasj1234 + 0907 is among the most far infrared luminous broad - line quasars known .      in figure",
    "[ fig : x - ray ] , we plot the x - ray spectrum of ulasj1234 + 0907 obtained using _ xmm - newton _ together with the best - fit model spectrum fit using xspec .",
    "the model includes galactic absorption plus intrinsic absorption ( at @xmath51 ) acting on a power law continuum with a narrow emission line at 6.4 kev to account for fluorescent fe k@xmath18 .",
    "the total flux in the hard x - ray band covering @xmath52 kev ( observed frame ) is @xmath53 erg s@xmath9@xmath13 from the model fit .",
    "the ( source rest - frame ) hard x - ray luminosity is therefore l@xmath10 erg / s in our adopted cosmology .",
    "the best - fit photon index is 1.68@xmath54 and the inferred hydrogen column density is n@xmath55@xmath13 .",
    "this column density agrees with the extinction of av=6 mags calculated from the near infrared broad - band colours in b12 assuming the dust properties are similar to our own milky way .",
    "the x - ray observations therefore indicate that ulasj1234 + 0907 is also among the most x - ray luminous quasars known with a hard x - ray luminosity that is almost two orders of magnitude greater than mrk231 and similar to the most powerful quasars in the universe .        in the most powerful quasars accreting at close to the eddington limit",
    ", the bolometric correction from the hard x - ray band is expected to be @xmath3650 - 100 @xcite .",
    "this implies that the agn bolometric luminosity of ulasj1234 + 0907 is @xmath56 erg / s . even assuming that all of this luminosity is seen as reprocessed dust emission in the far infrared , the shortfall in the total infrared luminosity calculated from the herschel data , is still @xmath57 erg / s . if this",
    "_ missing _",
    "infrared luminosity is to come from star formation , we now obtain an even more extreme star formation rate in the quasar host galaxy of @xmath366800 m@xmath4/yr .",
    "conversely , we can consider the bolometric luminosity of ulasj1234 + 0907 derived from the de - reddened uv luminosity : l@xmath58 erg / s ( b12 ) . based on this estimate of the bolometric luminosity and assuming a bolometric correction of @xmath36100 , the x - ray luminosity is predicted to be @xmath59 erg / s , more than an order of magnitude larger than what we measure .",
    "these discrepancies could indicate that the source is potentially x - ray weak .",
    "the census of known agn shows a remarkable lack of luminous , high eddington ratio quasars that also have high columns of dust @xcite .",
    "these conditions are expected to drive strong outflows due to the effects of radiation pressure on the dust @xcite .",
    "the lack of very luminous , dusty quasars is perhaps not surprising given that most rapidly accreting quasars with high eddington ratios have predominantly been selected at uv - optical wavelengths . in ulasj1234",
    "+ 0907 , the a@xmath60=6 mags at @xmath51 corresponds to 17.5 mags of extinction in the observed frame optical @xmath23-band . in other words ,",
    "the quasar flux is suppressed by a factor of @xmath3610@xmath61 at optical wavelengths due to absorption by dust making it invisible in even the deepest optical surveys coming up within the next decade e.g. lsst .",
    "highly reddened type 1 quasars like ulasj1234 + 0907 that are accreting at close to the eddington limit , are distinct from the well - studied obscured typeii agn population .",
    "the fek emission at rest - frame 6.4kev ( observed - frame 1.8 kev ) in the quasar spectrum in figure [ fig : x - ray ] is only marginally detected .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of ulasj1234 + 0907 is therefore markedly different from typical compton thick sources like ngc1068 where the fek@xmath18 line is much more prominent in the reflection dominated spectrum , and the photon index is considerably less steep .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we have demonstrated that ulasj1234 + 0907 is among the brightest and reddest broad - line quasars currently known with extremely high luminosities measured at both far infra - red and x - ray wavelengths .",
    "given these extreme luminosities , we should consider the possibility of the quasar being lensed .",
    "the strongest evidence against lensing is provided by our deep @xmath23 and @xmath30-band observations ( section [ sec : data ] ) .",
    "the optical image goes down to a magnitude limit of @xmath62 .",
    "even a high - redshift galaxy lens at @xmath63 should have been easily visible at these depths .",
    "the quasar is undetected in the @xmath23-band and there are no other galaxies present within a 7@xmath29 radius of the quasar position in this @xmath23-band image so there is no evidence to support the presence of a galaxy lens .",
    "the @xmath30-band data from isaac was taken in @xmath360.5@xmath29 seeing which would allow us to easily resolve multiple emission sources associated with lensed images of the quasar , should they have been present . from figure",
    "[ fig : cutouts ] , we see that there is no evidence for multiple images in this sub - arcsecond seeing @xmath30-band data .",
    "the @xmath30-band emission from the quasar is unresolved and consistent with the size of the psf .",
    "the lensing cross - section is therefore extremely small and the probability of lensing very low .",
    "the above suite of multi - wavelength observations has allowed us to build up a comprehensive picture of the properties of ulasj1234 + 0907 , the reddest broad - line quasar currently known . with an x - ray luminosity of l@xmath64=1.3@xmath3410@xmath65 erg / s and a total infrared luminosity of l@xmath40=3.1@xmath3410@xmath66 erg / s , ulasj1234 +",
    "0907 is among the most luminous quasars known at both these wavelengths . through sub - arcsecond ,",
    "deep imaging of the quasar in the @xmath23 and @xmath30-bands , we demonstrate that no galaxy lens is apparent in the optical and that the quasar emission is unresolved in the @xmath30-band .",
    "lensing is therefore unlikely to be responsible for the extreme luminosities of this source . even accounting for a large ( 62% ) contribution of the agn to the total infrared luminosity or assuming that only the fir luminosity between 40 and 300@xmath32 m is powered by a starburst , the estimated sfr in the host galaxy of this quasar is @xmath82000m@xmath4yr@xmath9 .",
    "measuring the agn bolometric luminosity directly from the hard x - ray luminosity ( assuming a bolometric correction of 100 ) and therefore requiring the rest of the total infra - red emission to be powered by a starburst , gives an even more extreme sfr of @xmath366800m@xmath4yr@xmath9 .",

    "we emphasise that reddened type 1 quasars like ulasj1234 + 0907 are distinct from the more highly obscured and less luminous type ii agn where the dust extinction can often be explained by orientation effects .",
    "we have provided some evidence that the dust extinction in ulasj1234 + 0907 arises on larger scales in the quasar host galaxy thus allowing the broad - line region to be viewed in the near infra - red .",
    "this dust is likely heated by both the agn and a powerful starburst as would be expected during blowout .",
    "although our observations do not directly detect agn driven outflows , the combination of a supermassive black - hole accreting at close to the eddington limit coupled with the high column density , is expected to drive strong outflows due to the effects of radiation pressure on dust .",
