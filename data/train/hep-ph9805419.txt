    "measurements of the spectra of high energy @xmath3rays , neutrinos and cosmic rays have emerged as a useful constraint on particle physics theories which predict topological defects ( for recent summaries see e.g. refs .",
    "although it does not appear likely that the emission of high energy particles by topological defects can explain the observed spectra , the current data can be used as upper bounds to constrain theories of particle physics beyond the standard model .    of particular interest for cosmology",
    "are theories giving rise to cosmic strings .",
    "some time ago , the spectrum of cosmic rays from non - superconducting strings was computed @xcite under the assumption of the _ standard _ scaling picture @xcite emerging from studies of cosmic string dynamics in an expanding universe ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for recent reviews ) . in the standard picture",
    ", the long string network evolves into string loops which then decay predominantly by gravitational radiation .",
    "it was found that for strings with @xmath4 ( required for strings to be relevant for cosmic structure formation @xcite ) , where @xmath5 is the mass per unit length in the string and @xmath6 is the newton gravitational constant , the predicted particle fluxes are substantially lower than the observational detections or limits .",
    "recently , however , vincent , hindmarsh and sakellariadou @xcite have challenged the standard picture of string evolution .",
    "they claim that the small - scale structure on the strings does not scale with the expansion of the universe . in the _ vhs _ scenario ,",
    "the long strings lose their energy directly into particles instead of string loops .",
    "this leads to a greater production rate of particles and hence to the expectation of greater fluxes of @xmath3rays , neutrinos , and cosmic rays at earth .",
    "expanding on these points further , detailed numerical simulations @xcite have demonstrated that in an expanding universe , the network of _ long _ cosmic strings ( _ long _ meaning with curvature radius greater than the hubble radius ) approaches a scaling solution in which the number of long string segments crossing each hubble radius approaches a constant value @xmath7 . in the vhs scenario , the string network maintains this scaling solution by the direct radiation of scalar and gauge particles . in the standard scenario ,",
    "the string network maintains the scaling solution by continuously giving off part of its energy in the form of string loops with radius smaller than the hubble radius .",
    "based on certain theoretical arguments ( see e.g. @xcite ) it is expected that the distribution of loops in the standard scenario also eventually takes on a scaling solution , i.e. when all lengths are scaled to the hubble radius , the statistical properties of the distribution of string loops are independent of time . however , the resolution of string network simulations ( nambu action strings ) is not yet good enough to be able to verify the standard scenario .",
    "moreover , recent field theory simulations @xcite provide some evidence that the string defects give off their energy not in the form of string loops , but directly by scalar and gauge particle radiation , thus corroborating the vhs scenario ( these latter simulations remain controversial @xcite ) .    in the standard cosmic string scenario ,",
    "the string loops oscillate due to the relativistic tension , and decay slowly by the emission of gravitational radiation .",
    "only a small fraction of the energy is released in the standard scenario in the form of scalar and gauge particle radiation .",
    "this occurs via the process of cusp annihilation @xcite , during the final loop collapse or by the evaporation of black holes created from string loops @xcite .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that for gut - scale ( @xmath4 ) strings the flux of ultra - high energy ( uhe ) particles in the standard picture from these mechanisms is at or below the relevant observational measurements or limits",
    ". the predicted flux increases , and may be observable , if the symmetry breaking scale is significantly lower .    in the vhs scenario , in contrast ,",
    "all of the string energy is released directly from the long strings as scalar and gauge particle radiation .",
    "additionally , the predicted flux increases as the symmetry breaking scale increases .",
    "hence , the flux of high energy @xmath3rays , neutrinos and cosmic rays in the vhs scenario is expected to be much larger than the fluxes from loops in the standard scenario .",
    "indeed , it has been remarked @xcite that the fluxes from gut scale strings in the vhs scenario will be above the observational limits . in this paper , we point out that this limit comes only from the neutrino emission at high energy and the cascades produced by the electromagnetic emission , whilst the nearest expected vhs string is too distant to produce an observable flux of cosmic rays or @xmath8-rays . in the vhs scenario the highest energy fluxes ( above the gzk cutoff ) of cosmic rays and @xmath8-rays are suppressed due to the interaction of these particles with the photons of the cosmic radiation backgrounds .",
    "the result is that no isotropic flux of cosmic rays and @xmath8-rays from a network of vhs strings is expected to be observed .",
    "however , the neutrino emission from low @xmath9 vhs strings may produce an observable signal .",
    "we present a detailed calculation in this paper of the neutrino , photon and cosmic ray fluxes for a range of string and decay scales .",
    "we also show that the predictions depend sensitively on the initial energy @xmath1 characterizing the decay of the particle radiation , which in turn depends on the presently unknown physics in the regime between the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking and the scale of string formation .",
    "we find that decreasing @xmath1 leads to a decrease in the upper cutoff in the predicted spectrum and an increase in the cosmic ray fluxes at intermediate energies .",
    "thus , even the additional freedom of decreasing @xmath1 can not make gut strings obeying vhs dynamics consistent with the observational constraints . nevertheless , in the event that a segment of long string is substantially closer than the expected average distance to the nearest string , a highly anisotropic flux of cosmic rays protons , antiprotons and @xmath8-rays could be observed above the gzk cutoff in the vhs scenario .",
    "this possibility , however , is not supported by the current observations of events above the gzk cutoff which exhibit large scale isotropy and at most only small scale clustering in arrival angle @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we perform for the first time the calculation of the tau neutrinos directly produced by the hadronic decays of the x - particles .",
    "the calculation of the direct @xmath10 spectrum has been not previously been included in the analysis of any cosmic string scenario .",
    "this was because it was assumed that the @xmath10 spectrum was highly suppressed at all energies compared with the @xmath11 and @xmath12 spectra .",
    "instead only the much weaker @xmath10 spectrum generated by the cascade of the x - decay @xmath11 and @xmath12 off the cosmic relic neutrino background was described . recently",
    ", however , macgibbon , wichoski , and webber @xcite have shown that , in hadronic jets at accelerator energies , the tau neutrinos are a significant fraction of the total neutrino spectrum at high @xmath13 , where @xmath13 is the ratio of the neutrino energy to the jet energy . extrapolating their fragmentation function parametrization for @xmath10 to uhe energies ,",
    "we show here that , in the vhs and all other cosmic string scenarios , the directly produced tau neutrinos generate a signal at earth comparable at the highest energies with the expected @xmath11 and @xmath12 signal .",
    "this flux is orders of magnitude greater than the contribution from the cascade @xmath10 .",
    "one consequence of our result is that the detection of a significant fraction of @xmath10 in uhe neutrino events may be due to hadronic decay at the source and not @xmath14 oscillation in transit .    in the following sections , we present the neutrino , photon and cosmic ray spectra for vanilla emission taking @xmath15 and omitting susy particles in the jet decay .",
    "however , we discuss in section [ sec : ext ] the effects of including a susy sector , non - zero neutrino mass , neutrino oscillation or other extensions to the standard model . in the appendix , we perform the full computation of the flux of secondary muon and electron neutrinos resulting from muon decay in the particle jets .",
    "we use units in which @xmath16 , unless otherwise stated , and take a hubble constant of @xmath17 .",
    "if the network of long strings scales , then the corresponding energy density @xmath18 at time @xmath19 is @xmath20 where @xmath5 is the mass per unit length in the string .",
    "this equation defines the constant @xmath7 which counts the number of strings per volume @xmath21 in the scaling solution .",
    "the value of @xmath7 can be determined from simulations of cosmic string network evolution .",
    "current work @xcite gives @xmath22 . in the vhs scenario ,",
    "the scaling solution is maintained not by the production of string loops , but by the radiation of gauge and scalar particles ( which we collectively call x - particles in the following ) .",
    "making use of the equation of state of a string , the continuity equation becomes @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the number density and mass , respectively , of the x - particles .",
    "@xmath25 is effectively the symmetry breaking scale at which the string formed , @xmath26 ( e.g. @xmath27 gev for @xmath4 ) . strictly speaking , @xmath28 with the exact factor depending on the form of the potential of the scalar field .",
    "the decay of the high energy x - particles will lead to the production of jets analogous to the qcd jets seen in accelerators . to simplify the discussion we assume that all jets in the x - decay have the same initial energy , @xmath1 . in this case",
    ", the decay of a single x - particle will lead to @xmath29 jets , and the number density of jets generated by the energy release of long strings is @xmath30    the largest uncertainty in the calculation of the flux of high energy particles generated by strings comes from our ignorance of the structure of the jets at ultra - high initial energies . jet production has been studied in detail in qcd . from such studies , the fragmentation function of jets into photons , neutrinos and baryons",
    "is known @xcite , at least to a good approximation , up to a few tev . however , in our case the particles producing the jets are superheavy scalar and gauge particles .",
    "following refs .",
    "@xcite , the fragmentation functions of such jets are usually calculated by extrapolating the qcd fragmentation functions to higher energies ( in which case @xmath1 is taken to be @xmath31 ) .",
    "this is appropriate if there is no new physics which does not match this extrapolation between the electroweak symmetry breaking scale and the unification scale ( the scale at which the defects are produced ) , but it is not justified if there is new physics which does not sufficiently match the extrapolation .",
    "we will parametrize ignorance about new physics and its effects on the jets from the x - particle decay by introducing a new scale @xmath1 ( which may be the scale of the new physics ) as the scale to which we can satisfactorily extrapolate the fragmentation functions from the qcd regime .",
    "we will then assume that the initial scalar or gauge x - particle produces @xmath29 jets with initial energy @xmath1 each .",
    "( in reality , there may be intermediate decay steps between the @xmath25 and @xmath1 decay scales . ) while this may or may not be the precise description of the decay , it will at least help further quantify the dependence of the final fluxes on the uncertainties in the fragmentation process .",
    "the initial jet particle decays into quarks and leptons on a time scale of @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the coupling constant associated with the physics at the energy scale @xmath1 .",
    "the quarks then hadronize on a strong interaction time scale .",
    "more than 90% of the total energy in a qcd jet goes into pions , with the majority of the remainder going into baryons ( mainly neutrons , antineutrons , protons and antiprotons ) . on astrophysical time scales , the neutral pions decay into two photons , the charged pions decay into electron and muon neutrinos and electrons or positrons , and the neutrons decay into protons and leptons .",
    "in addition , a relatively small but still significant number of tau neutrinos are produced by the decay of heavy quarks and tau leptons .",
    "non - jet leptons @xmath34 produced by the decay @xmath35 may also influence the observable @xmath8-ray flux below @xmath36 ev ( see section [ sec : obs ] ) .",
    "the distribution of energies @xmath37 of the primary qcd jet decay products ( predominantly equal numbers of @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) can be approximated by the fragmentation function @xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the fraction of the jet energy carried by the decay product and @xmath37 continues down to @xmath42 ev .",
    "the two body decays of the primary @xmath38 or @xmath39 decay particles lead , on the average , to two photons and two primary muon neutrinos for every three pions .",

    "<S> decaying topological defects , in particular cosmic strings , can produce a significant flux of high energy neutrinos , photons and cosmic rays . according to the prevailing understanding of cosmic string dynamics in an expanding universe </S>",
    "<S> , the network of long strings loses its energy first into string loops , which in turn give off most of their energy as gravitational radiation . </S>",
    "<S> however , it has been suggested by vincent _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ ( vhs ) that particle emission may be the dominant energy loss channel for the long string network . </S>",
    "<S> in this case , the predicted flux of high energy particles would be much larger . here </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the predicted flux of high energy gamma rays , neutrinos and cosmic ray antiprotons and protons as a function of the scale of symmetry breaking @xmath0 at which the strings are produced and as a function of the initial energy @xmath1 of the particle jets which result from the string decay . assuming the validity of the vhs scenario </S>",
    "<S> , we find that due to the interactions with the cosmic radiation backgrounds all fluxes but the neutrino flux are suppressed at the highest energies . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the observed events above the gzk cutoff can only be accounted for in this scenario if the primary particle is a neutrino and @xmath0 is somewhat less than the gut scale , i.e. @xmath2 ev . </S>",
    "<S> the domain of parameter space corresponding to gut - scale symmetry breaking is excluded also by the current observations below the gzk cutoff . </S>",
    "<S> a new aspect of this work is the calculation of the spectrum of the tau neutrinos directly produced in the decay of the x - particles . </S>",
    "<S> this significantly increases the tau neutrino signal at high energies in all cosmic string scenarios . </S>"
