    "<S> [ [ section ] ]    flow instabilities and nonlinear dynamics have long been recognized to occur in flows of viscoelastic polymer melts and solutions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an important breakthrough , which has led to increasing recent attention to these phenomena , was made by larson , shaqfeh and muller  @xcite , who discovered that circular couette flow of a viscoelastic liquid undergoes an instability loosely analogous to the classical taylor - couette instability of newtonian liquids , but driven solely by elasticity - the instability is present at zero taylor ( reynolds ) number . </S>",
    "<S> they also showed that a linear stability analysis of a simple fluid model predicts instability and elucidated the basic elasticity - driven mechanism of the instability . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , although many researchers had studied the effects of viscoelasticity on the newtonian ( inertial ) taylor - couette instability , both experimentally  @xcite , and theoretically  @xcite , these workers were the first to demonstrate an inertialess , purely elastic mechanism for instability in a viscometric flow . </S>",
    "<S> more recent observations have revealed a wealth of interesting dynamics in this flow as well as other simple flows  @xcite ; one set of experimental observations of particular interest was made by groisman and steinberg  @xcite , who found long - wavelength , stationary axisymmetric vortex pair structures in inertialess viscoelastic flow in the circular couette geometry . </S>",
    "<S> there are two interesting aspects to these observations : ( 1 ) isothermal linear stability analysis in this geometry never predicts bifurcation of stationary states ( in contrast to the classical taylor - couette case ) and ( 2 ) the observations suggest that these vortex pairs , which groisman and steinberg dubbed `` diwhirls '' , can exist in isolation  there does not seem to be a selected axial wavelength for this pattern . </S>",
    "<S> these considerations motivate the present computational study , which addresses the following questions : ( 1 ) do isolated branches of stationary solutions exist in a simple model of a viscoelastic fluid in the circular couette geometry ? </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) if so , what are the spatial structures of these ? are they localized ? ( 3 ) a nonlinear self - sustaining mechanism must be present for such patterns to exist . can the computations help us elucidate it ?    </S>",
    "<S> we address these questions by fully nonlinear computations of the branching behavior of an inertialess isothermal fene dumbbell fluid in the circular couette geometry . </S>",
    "<S> introduction of an azimuthal body force as an additional parameter allows the possibility of accessing steady solution branches that would be isolated in the parameter space of couette flow . </S>",
    "<S> we find in short that the answers to all of the above questions is yes : isolated solution branches consisting of spatially localized coherent structures have been computed for the first time in a purely elastic flow , in very good agreement with the experimental observations , and a heuristic , fully nonlinear mechanism has been elucidated .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider the flow of an inertialess polymer solution in the annulus between two concentric cylinders . </S>",
    "<S> the inner cylinder has radius @xmath0 and the outer cylinder has radius @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the flow is assumed to periodic in the axial direction , and we denote the period , nondimensionalized with the gap width @xmath2 , by @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the fluid has a relaxation time @xmath4 ; the polymer and solvent contributions to the viscosity are denoted respectively by @xmath5 and @xmath6 , with the ratio @xmath7 denoted by @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the flow is created by a combination of the motion of the inner cylinder at a velocity @xmath9 and by the application of an azimuthal pressure gradient @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the equations governing the flow are the momentum and mass conservation equations , and the fene - p constitutive equation  @xcite , which models polymers as beads connected by finitely extensible springs . </S>",
    "<S> these may be written in dimensionless form as @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the velocity , @xmath15 is the pressure , @xmath16 is the ensemble average of the conformation tensor , and @xmath17 is the polymer stress tensor , with @xmath18 being a dimensionless measure of the maximum extensibility of the dumbbells . the weissenberg number , @xmath19 is the product of the polymer relaxation time and a characteristic shear rate , which we take to be the shear rate at the outer cylinder for an oldroyd - b fluid ( @xmath20 ) flowing through the geometry . </S>",
    "<S> other important parameters are the dimensionless gap width , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , which measures the relative importance of the pressure gradient as the driving force for the flow , given by @xmath23 so that @xmath24 is circular couette flow and @xmath25 is dean flow ( pressure driven flow in a curved channel ) . the velocity satisfies no slip boundary conditions on the walls of the cylinder . </S>",
    "<S> we compute steady , axisymmetric solutions to the governing equations using a spectral element scheme  @xcite with galerkin weighting on the conservation equations and streamline - upwind / petrov - galerkin weighting  @xcite on the constitutive equations . </S>",
    "<S> we use a branch switching technique to compute starting points on non - trivial branches , and pseudo - arclength continuation to trace out solution curves in parameter space  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the linear systems in the newton iteration are solved using gmres @xcite , with a modified dual threshold preconditioner  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we restrict our attention to parameters which are close to those used in the experiments by groisman and steinberg  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we choose parameter values @xmath26 , and @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> the reynolds numbers in their experiments were @xmath28 , so our neglect of inertia corresponds well to their experiments . in our computations </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the most interesting behavior occurs only for large values of @xmath29 , so for the results we present below , we choose a value of @xmath30 .    in the couette flow case ( @xmath24 ) , there is no bifurcation from the viscometric base state to a stationary nontrivial state  if they exist , any branches of nontrivial stationary states in this case are isolated . </S>",
    "<S> so to pursue such solutions , an indirect approach must be taken . </S>",
    "<S> we use the fact that in pure pressure - driven flow ( @xmath25 ) , stationary bifurcations do exist  by continuity these bifurcations also exist for @xmath31 and we search for a route to the couette case by exploring the evolution of these bifurcating branches . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we traced out a stationary branch originating at @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , then increased @xmath3 to @xmath35 while holding the values of the other parameters fixed , then reduced @xmath22 downward , finding that this solution branch persisted at @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> we have thereby shown that there is indeed an isolated branch of nontrivial stationary patterns in the circular couette flow geometry . </S>",
    "<S> if we now decrease @xmath3 , we find a turning point at @xmath36 , so these solutions do not exist for wavelengths shorter than this . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> when we increase @xmath3 , we find that the solutions exist at arbitrarily large wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> figure 1 shows the contours of the streamfunction and @xmath37 at @xmath38 ( i.e. , the axial wavelength is more than 100 times times the gap width ! ) the core of the pattern ( which has been magnified for clarity ) is a region of very strong inflow , surrounded by regions of much weaker outflow . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath37 field shows an even more intense localization at the core and requires the use of a very fine spectral element mesh to resolve . </S>",
    "<S> the strong localization at the core and the asymmetry between inflow and outflow are features shared by the experimentally observed diwhirls  @xcite , which indicates that we are capturing the physics behind the structures they observe . </S>",
    "<S> away from the core , the flow field is almost pure circular couette flow . in obtaining solutions at very large values of @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> , we exploited the lack of axial variation away from the center and the fact that the characteristic length of the localization near the core does not change at large wavelengths by using the same mesh as at smaller values of @xmath3 close to the center , and simply increasing the lengths of the spectral elements bordering the axial edges .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 2 shows the results of continuation in @xmath19 for three different values of @xmath3 . in each case </S>",
    "<S> , we see a turning point in @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> it is located at @xmath39 for @xmath40 , at @xmath41 for @xmath42 , and at @xmath43 for @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> the point at which the diwhirls lose existence is much lower than the critical @xmath19 for linear instability at that wavelength , so that the overall bifurcation structure shows a hysteretic character , consistent with experiment .    </S>",
    "<S> a natural question regarding these new flow states is their stability . </S>",
    "<S> we have performed linear stability analyses with respect to axisymmetric perturbations , for selected parameter values . </S>",
    "<S> these results will be detailed elsewhere  @xcite , but the main result is simple and interesting : there is an unstable complex conjugate pair of eigenvalues , corresponding to instability with respect to oscillatory disturbances . the destabilizing disturbance , however , has significant amplitude only near the ends of the domain , where the flow is essentially couette flow ( which is linearly unstable at the parameter values chosen ) and vanishes in the core region of the diwhirl . </S>",
    "<S> so the picture that emerges is this : the diwhirl pattern is robust , and it coexists with , but is spatially distinct from , the oscillatory finite wavelength pattern arising from the linear instability .    by estimating the work done by a fluid element in a single flow cycle ( as seen in a lagrangian reference frame ) , groisman and steinberg  @xcite argued that long wavelength stationary structures which exhibited significant asymmetry between inflow and outflow were possible in couette flow . </S>",
    "<S> while this argument shows that diwhirl structures are physically plausible , it does not explain the mechanism by which they are sustained . </S>",
    "<S> having the complete velocity and stress field available to us , we propose a more complete mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> figure 3 shows a vector plot of @xmath14 near the outer cylinder at the center of the diwhirl structure . </S>",
    "<S> we see that the @xmath45 field at the diwhirl center is locally parabolic near the outer cylinder , similar to the velocity field in the upper half of the channel in dean flow , which displays a stationary vortex instability due to the corresponding unstable stratification of the azimuthal normal stress  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore propose the following mechanism for the instability : a local , finite amplitude perturbation near the outer cylinder creates a locally parabolic velocity profile . </S>",
    "<S> this velocity profile results in an unstable stratification of hoop stress , just as in dean flow , which drives inward radial motion . </S>",
    "<S> the fluid accelerates azimuthally as it moves radially inward , due to the base state velocity gradient , thus maintaining the increase in @xmath45 , resulting in a self - sustaining process ( figure 4 ) .    to summarize , we have computed stationary nontrivial solutions in circular couette flow using a fene - p model by numerical continuation from stationary bifurcations in couette - dean flow . </S>",
    "<S> these solutions show very strong localization , exist only for large values of @xmath29 and large wavelengths , and show a hysteretic character in @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> the self - sustaining mechanism is related to the mechanism of instability in viscoelastic dean flow , and arises from a finite amplitude perturbation giving rise to a locally parabolic profile of the azimuthal velocity near the upper wall . </S>",
    "<S> the computed flow structures are very similar to the experimentally observed diwhirl patterns  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> along with the solutions arising from the linear instability of the circular couette flow base state , we propose that these solutions form building blocks for spatiotemporal dynamics in the flow of elastic liquids .    </S>",
