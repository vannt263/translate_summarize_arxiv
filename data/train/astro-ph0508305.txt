    "the ubiquity of close - in earths is inferred from the sa hypothesis because their formation is promoted by : 1 ) the anticipated formation of embryos prior to the emergence of giants , 2 ) the driven migration of the embryos by the giants mmr and sr , 3 ) the tidal interaction between the embryos and their nascent disks , and 4 ) the embryos induced collisions along their migration path .",

    "although their day - side temperature may exceed 500k , the night - side of these close - in earths may be much cooler @xcite because their atmosphere is likely to be covered by opaque clouds .",
