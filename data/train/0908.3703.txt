    "v368  aql ( nova aquilae 1936 no .",
    "2 ) was discovered at kvistaberg observatory on 7 october 1936 by taam ( 1936 ) as an optical transient of roughly seventh magnitude .",
    "the outburst light curve based on observations by several observers ( see payne - gaposchkin 1957 ; klemola 1968 ) , showed that maximum light occurred approximately two weeks earlier on 1936 september 25 at @xmath1 .",
    "the nova faded relatively quickly , dropping by three magnitudes in @xmath2  days ( @xmath3  d ) , making v368  aql a moderately fast nova .",
    "spectroscopic observations made @xmath425 days after maximum revealed an absorption - line system consisting of h , ca  ii , he  ii @xmath5 , n  iii , and probably he  i and fe  ii , along with strong , broad ( @xmath6  km  s@xmath7 balmer emission ( wyse 1936 ) . based on these data",
    "the spectroscopic class of v368  aql is ambiguous , but the probable detection of fe  ii , and the moderate width of the balmer lines suggest that the object was likely a member of either the  fe  ii \" or  hybrid \" classes of novae as defined by williams ( 1992 ) .    aside from its identification at minimum light by klemola ( 1968 ) , v368  aql slipped into relative obscurity until time - resolved photometric observations by diaz & bruch ( 1994 ) revealed shallow eclipses in the light curve .",
    "a total of just two eclipses were observed during their 11 nights of observation in 1990 may , and 1993 july and august .",
    "based on a periodogram analysis of their entire dataset diaz & bruch concluded that the orbital period of v368  aql was likely to be @xmath8  d ( 8.29  hr ) .",
    "as part of a program to study the eclipse morphologies of classical novae , we obtained a sequence of time - resolved observations of v368  aql on the nights of 2005 september 3 , 4 , and 5 ut .",
    "to our surprise , although the night of september 4 revealed an eclipse , none were observed on the adjacent nights at the times expected for an orbital period of 8.29  hr . in order to establish the true orbital period and to better understand the eclipse morphology",
    ", we undertook a more extensive program of time - resolved , multi - color ccd photometry of the eclipses of v368  aql .",
    "a preliminary report , establishing that the orbital period of v368  aql is actually twice that originally reported by diaz & bruch ( 1994 ) , has been posted in shafter et al .",
    "here we provide a more detailed discussion of our findings , including additional eclipse observations that have enabled us to improve the precision of the revised orbital period .",
    "a finding chart for v368  aql based on one of our @xmath9-band images from 2005 september 4 is presented in figure  1 .",
    "observations of v368  aql were carried out during 8 nights in 2005 september and october , and 17 nights in 2008 june through august using the mount laguna observatory 1  m reflector . on each night",
    "a series of exposures ( typically 60  s ) were taken through one of the johnson - cousins @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 filters ( see bessel 1990 ) , and imaged on a loral @xmath13 ccd . to increase the time - sampling efficiency ,",
    "only a @xmath14 subsection of the full array was read out .",
    "the subsection was chosen to include v368  aql and several relatively bright nearby stars to be used as comparison objects for differential photometry .",
    "twilight flat images of the same size were taken and averaged for each run .",
    "the data were processed in a standard fashion ( bias subtraction and flat - fielding ) using iraf .",
    "the individual images were subsequently aligned to a common coordinate system and instrumental magnitudes for v368  aql and two nearby comparison stars were then determined using the _ iraf _ apphot package .",
    "variations in atmospheric transparency were removed to first order by dividing the flux of v368  aql by that of one of two nearby comparison stars marked c1 and c2 in figure  1 .",
    "the differential light curves were then placed on an absolute scale by calibration of the comparison stars against the standard stars in landolt ( 1992 ) .",
    "our calibration reveals that stars c1 and c2 are characterized by @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , respectively , where the errors quoted include the uncertainty in the mean extinction coefficients used in the calibration .",
    "the calibrated light curves of v368  aql from our initial run in early september 2005 are shown in figure  2 , while the eclipse light curves from 2008 are segregated by color and displayed in figures  36 .",
    "a summary of all observations is presented in table  1 .",
    "the eclipse light curves are quite variable with the out - of - eclipse light levels in a given bandpass varying by up to 0.5 magnitudes on time scales from weeks to months .",
    "the eclipse depths for a given color are are also variable , but at reduced level .",
    "the fact that the eclipse depths are less variable than the out - of - eclipse light levels suggests that most of the variability comes from un - eclipsed regions of the system ( i.e. the outer accretion disk , the secondary star , or both . ) .",
    "not unexpectedly , the eclipse depth is greatest in the @xmath9 band , where the light level drops @xmath23  mag at mid eclipse , indicating that roughly half of the total system light is eclipsed . at longer wavelengths the eclipse depth decreases as the contribution from the secondary star to",
    "the total system light begins to dominate .",
    "this increased contribution manifests itself through the emergence of ellipsoidal variations , which are seen most clearly in the @xmath11-band light curves .",
    "during our 25 nights of observation , a total of 14 eclipses ( 12 complete and two partial ) of v368  aql were observed . eclipse timings for the 12 complete eclipses were measured by fitting a parabola to the lower half of the eclipse profile and taking the vertex as the time of mid - eclipse .",
    "the resulting timings , plus the two available from diaz & bruch ( 1994 ) are summarized in table  2 .",
    "although all of the timings can be fit with the 8.29  hr period found by diaz & bruch ( 1994 ) , as mentioned earlier , their period also predicts eclipses at times when none are observed to occur ( e.g. , see fig .",
    "2 ) . thus , the true orbital period must be an integer multiple of the 8.29  hr period .",
    "partial eclipse observations on consecutive nights with an ingress observed just before sunrise on 2008 june 30 ut followed by an egress observed just after sunset on 2008 july 1 ut ( see fig .",
    "3 ) resolved the cycle count ambiguity and established that the true orbital period was ( roughly ) twice the p=8.29  hr period .",
    "a linear least - squares fit of all the mid - eclipse times yields the following revised ephemeris for v368  aql :    @xmath24    residuals of the individual eclipse timings with respect to this ephemeris are also given in table  2 , and are plotted as a function of cycle number in figure  7 .",
    "there is no evidence for any second - order trend that might suggest a change in period over the interval spanned by the observations .",
    "our observations have revealed that the orbital period of v368  aql is roughly twice that previously accepted making it one of the longest periods known among the cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) .",
    "the orbital period of v368  aql is compared with the periods of other classical novae and with cvs in general in figure  8 .",
    "of 741 cvs with known orbital period ( ritter & kolb 2003 ) , only 16 have periods longer than v368  aql , with eight of those also being nova systems .",
    "it is well known that the orbital period distribution of novae differs from that of cvs generally .",
    "the most striking difference is the relative paucity of nova systems below the period gap ( log  @xmath25 ) .",
    "this difference can be explained by the fact that systems below the gap , where the accretion rates driven by gravitational radiation are low , require a higher envelope mass to be accreted before a thermonuclear runaway ( tnr ) is triggered ( e.g. townsley & bildsten 2005 ) .",
    "the envelope mass required to trigger a tnr increases sharply with decreasing white dwarf mass .",
    "the necessity for the larger envelope mass coupled with the low accretion rate requires the system to accrete for a relatively long interval between consecutive nova outbursts , resulting in a low observed nova rate among the short period cvs .",
    "it is less well known that the orbital period distributions for novae and cvs in general differs at long orbital periods as well .",
    "for example , it is interesting to note that although among cvs with known orbital period novae make up just a little more than 10% of the total , among systems with orbital periods of more than 0.5  d , novae make up roughly half ( 12 out of 25 ) of the total .",
    "it is likely that a combination of generally higher mass accretion rates and higher white dwarf masses ( required for stable mass transfer ) among the longest period systems is responsible for the increased fraction of nova systems in this period regime .",
    "table  3 summarizes the known properties of the 12 classical novae with orbital periods in excess of 0.5  d. of the 8 novae with information on their spectroscopic class available , roughly half either belong to the he / n or hybrid classes .",
    "this contrasts with novae at all orbital periods where the he / n and hybrid classes combined make up a total of only @xmath26% of the total ( shafter 2007 ) .",
    "in addition two of the 12 long period novae are recurrent .",
    "the relatively high percentage of he / n , hybrid , and recurrent novae among the long period systems is consistent with the expectation that these systems contain on average higher mass white dwarfs accreting at higher rates .",
    "we have found that the previously published orbital period for v368  aql ( @xmath27  d , diaz & bruch 1994 ) was an alias of the true orbital period .",
    "a total of 14 eclipses ( 2 partial ) over 17 nights of observation have established that the orbital period of v368  aql is actually @xmath0  d ( 16.57  hr ) . the revised orbital period for v368",
    "aql places the system among the other long - period nova systems that dominate the statistics at the upper end of the cv period distribution .",
    "future work on v368  aql should include a radial velocity study and an effort to model of the eclipse profiles in order to constrain system parameters , particularly the white dwarf mass and accretion rate .",
