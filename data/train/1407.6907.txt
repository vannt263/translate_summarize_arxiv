    "<S> we have fabricated and characterized a nano - electromechanical hybrid system consisting of a superconducting microwave resonator and a non - metallized nanomechanical beam . on decreasing the temperature , for a beam with a resonance frequency of about @xmath1 we observe an increase of the mechanical quality factor from @xmath81 at room temperature to @xmath0 at @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> for strong external driving forces we observe the transition from the linear to the duffing regime and use this to quantify the mechanical displacement amplitude of the beam . fitting the peak values of the measured homodyne power spectra allows us to precisely determine the mechanical amplitude . </S>",

    "<S> this work opens the path for further experimental studies of mechanical losses in silicon nitride at millikelvin temperatures , extending previous work on the damping mechanisms in si@xmath3n@xmath4 nanomechanical beams @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the concept of dielectrically coupling a pure si@xmath3n@xmath4 nanobeam to a high-@xmath83 microwave resonator is promising especially for sensing devices , e.g.  for the detection of single molecules , which require high frequency resolution and thus low damping constants .    </S>",
