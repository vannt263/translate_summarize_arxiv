    "transport in integrable systems is anomalous .",
    "this means that a harmonic lattice ( or a transverse ising chain ) can not support an internal thermal gradient when the two ends of the system are kept at different temperatures .",
    "the temperature profile that forms is flat everywhere apart from the neighborhood of the boundaries , and the energy flux is clearly not proportional to the temperature gradient inside the sample . the origin of this anomaly is the fact that currents in integrable systems ( energy currents in the above examples ) often emerge as integrals of motion thus causing the transport coefficients to be divergent or ill defined @xcite .",
    "the existence of flat density ( temperature ) profiles in the presence of ( energy ) currents points to the important role played by the homogeneous , current - carrying states in integrable systems . in previous papers",
    ", we suggested that a method of constructing such states at zero temperature is to add to the hamiltonian an appropriate current with a lagrange multiplier and then find the ground state of the system .",
    "this method can be applied with relative ease to models such as the transverse ising and isotropic @xmath13 ( so called @xmath0 ) models , and one can calculate the effect of energy current on experimentally measurable correlations .",
    "since there are physical systems that are rather well approximated as @xmath0 models @xcite , and since the effect of currents should be measurable in inelastic neutron scattering experiments @xcite , one should carefully examine the validity of the assumptions underlying the calculations of the correlations . the lagrange multiplier method is based on the assumption that the homogeneous , current - carrying states are the same whether they were induced by boundary conditions or by bulk driving fields .",
    "this is not an obvious assumption and its validity should be checked by first solving the boundary condition problem and then comparing the results with those obtained from the lagrange - multiplier method .",
    "unfortunately , the execution of this program runs into difficulties since the boundary condition problem is nontrivial and we can not provide an exact solution for any of the interesting cases .",
    "one can make some progress , however , in a closely related problem .",
    "namely , current - carrying states generated by inhomogeneous initial conditions can be studied and one can ask whether those states were describable by the lagrange multiplier method . in order to illuminate the new problem , let us imagine the original problem as finding the steady state of a brick with two of its opposite sides kept at different temperatures . in the new problem , we have two semi - infinite bricks at different temperatures and , at time zero , the bricks are joined at the ends .",
    "if the bricks were integrable systems then one would expect that the time - evolution would produce an interesting temperature profile with a flat part around the joining point and it would be meaningful to compare the profile as well as various local expectation values to those obtained from the lagrange - multiplier method .",
    "this is what we shall do in this paper for the @xmath0 chain after making the following simplifications .",
    "first , we note that the transverse magnetization , @xmath2 , is a conserved quantity in the @xmath0 model .",
    "since this is a much simpler quantity to treat , we shall study the transport of @xmath2 instead of the transport of the energy .",
    "second , we restrict our study to the zero - temperature properties of the system .",
    "third , we shall use a simple inhomogeneous initial state pasted together from two zero - temperature homogeneous pieces with @xmath14 and @xmath15 .    as a result of the above simplifications ,",
    "the problem of time - evolution becomes solvable and the formation of a flat magnetization profile can be observed .",
    "we find that both the magnetization profile and the fermionic two - point correlations agree with the results obtained from the lagrange multiplier method , thus indicating that the method does work for obtaining the homogeneous current carrying states .",
    "we start ( sec.[model ] ) by defining the system and constructing the initial state in terms of fermionic operators .",
    "next , the time evolution of the magnetization is calculated and the scaling form , @xmath7 , of the long - time limit is discussed ( sec.[magn ] ) .",
    "finally , we show that the local properties of the scaling limit can be described using the homogeneous , current carrying states obtained from the lagrange multiplier method ( sec.[conserv ] ) .",
    "the system we investigate is the @xmath0 model defined by the hamiltonian h^xx=_nh^xx_n = -j_n ( s^x_n s^x_n+1 + s^y_n s^y_n+1 ) [ trxyhami ] where the spins , @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) , are @xmath18 times the pauli matrices situated at the sites of a one - dimensional periodic lattice @xmath19 .",
    "the coupling , @xmath20 , is set to @xmath21 throughout this paper and @xmath22 is assumed in most of our calculations .",
    "the @xmath23 component of the total magnetization , @xmath24 , is conserved in this system and , using the continuity equation for @xmath25 , a local magnetization current can be defined @xcite : j^m_n = s^y_n s^x_n+1 - s^x_n s^y_n+1 .",
    "[ loccurrent ] it can be easily shown that the global magnetization current , @xmath26 , commutes with the hamiltonian ( [ trxyhami ] ) and thus one can classify the eigenstates of @xmath27 by the global current flowing through the system . below we shall study how the initial conditions can generate states that are locally homogeneous and carry a finite magnetization current .",
    "the time - evolution that follows from a given initial condition can be calculated for the @xmath0 model since , using a jordan - wigner transformation , this model can be transformed into a set of free fermions @xcite h^xx=-_k k  b^_k b_k [ diaghxx ] where @xmath28 is the annihilation operator of a fermion of wave - number @xmath29 .",
    "it follows that the time evolution of the @xmath28 operators is known @xmath30 and a fourier transform provides us with the time dependence of a local fermi operator , @xmath31 , as a sum of bessel functions of the first kind @xcite c_n(t ) = _ j c_j(0 ) i^j - n j_j - n(t )  .",
    "[ c ] the above expression is the starting point for our calculations since we wish study the local transverse magnetization , @xmath32 , that can be expressed through the local fermi operators as s^z_n = c^+_n c_n - 12  .",
    "our aim is to find the time evolution of the expectation value of @xmath32 m(n , t)=|s_n^z(t ) | using an initial state @xmath33 that is expected to produce a magnetization current .",
    "the simplest such state has a symmetric step in the initial magnetization | s_n^z(0 ) |= \\ {    ll m_0   & -m_0 &    . [ m_0 ] the above condition , however , does not specify the initial state uniquely . in order to define @xmath34 precisely , we shall construct the state of the @xmath35 spins as a direct product of states of two systems of @xmath36 spins .",
    "the _ left _ system contains the @xmath37 spins while the _ right _ one is built from the rest ( @xmath38 ) . in order to get close to a zero - temperature , current - carrying state we choose the lowest energy state under the above conditions ( [ m_0 ] ) .",
    "namely , both half - chains are chosen to be in their ground states with the magnetizations being @xmath5 and @xmath3 in the _ left _ and _ right _ , respectively .",
    "another reason for choosing such a state comes from trying to avoid possible energy currents in the system . in the @xmath22 limit ,",
    "the above state is a ground state of the model at fixed @xmath39 and the two homogeneous sides have the same energy .",
    "thus one expects that only magnetization current will flow in the course of the time - evolution of the system .",
    "a formal definition of @xmath34 with the above properties can be given as follows .",
    "let us define annihilation operators on the _ left _ and on _ right _ by the fourier transforms of the fermionic operators , @xmath31 , on the appropriate sides of the system l_k = 1 _ j =- l+1 ^ 0 e^ikj c_j  ,   r_k = 1 _ j=1^l e^ikj c_j  .",
    "as can be shown , these operators are also fermionic operators with the anticommutation relations : @xmath40 , and the initial state , @xmath33 , can be written as |= _ k =- k_-^k_- r_k^+ _ k=-k_+^k_+ l_k^+ | [ leftright ] where @xmath41 is the state with all spins down and @xmath42 . in the following @xmath43 will be assumed without restricting the generality of the arguments .",

    "[ mzgeneral ] it follows now from the special construction of @xmath33 that the terms with @xmath45 and @xmath46 on different side of the origin vanish .",
    "furthermore , the terms where @xmath47 is odd cancel since the expectation value is real .",
    "the calculation of @xmath48 is carried out by using the explicit form ( eqs .",

    "the results from the numerical analysis ( see fig.[fig : mscale ] ) show that the magnetization profile evolves into a scaling form in the large - time limit m(n , t)(n / t ) [ scaling ] with the following scaling function ( analytically obtained in sec.[sec : anres ] ) giving an excellent fit to the data : & & ( v)=-(-v)= & & \\ {    ll 0 & -m_0 + 1(v )   & -12 &    .",

    "the value of the integral can be obtained by replacing the fast oscillating @xmath79 term [ see ( [ blimit ] ) ] by its average value @xmath18 .",
