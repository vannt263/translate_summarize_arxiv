    "superconductivity with a remarkably high transition temperature @xmath2  k was recently discovered in mgb@xmath3 @xcite . the subsequent investigation of the boron isotope effect by budko _ et al . _",
    "@xcite revealed a partial isotope exponent @xmath4 ( corresponding to @xmath5k ) which appears to be consistent with a phonon - mediated bcs superconducting ( sc ) mechanism .",
    "also other experimental reports as e.g.on specific heat  @xcite argued that their data can be accounted for by a conventional , s - wave type bcs - model .",
    "investigations of the sc gap of @xmath0 by means of raman scattering are also consistent with an isotropic s - wave gap with a moderate coupling @xmath6 @xcite . however , a theoretical analysis of the temperature dependence of the upper critical field @xmath7 in terms of eliashberg type models by shulga _ et al . _",
    "@xcite demonstrates that the shape and the magnitude of the upper critical field of mgb@xmath3 can definitely not be accounted for by an isotropic single band model , but may successfully be described within a multi - band eliashberg model with various options . a careful calorimetric investigation of the sc parameters of mgb@xmath3 by wang _ et al .",
    "@xcite gave even more direct evidence against the arguments for simple isotropic bcs type superconductivity : `` the nearly quadratic dependence of @xmath8 versus @xmath9 at @xmath10 , its non - linear field dependence , and the discrepancy between the electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath11 as determined by the renormalization of the electron density of states ( @xmath12 ) and by mcmillan s equation for isotropic superconductors ( @xmath13 ) , are inconsistent with a single isotropic gap '' .",
    "direct hints for a non bcs temperature dependence of the gap energy @xmath14 were also obtained by tunneling experiments on mgb@xmath3/ag and mgb@xmath3/in junctions  @xcite .",
    "thermal conductivity @xmath15 is one of those transport coefficients which exhibits non - zero values in both the normal and the sc state .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath15 allows to distinguish between the most important interactions present in a superconductor .",
    "in particular , the interaction of electrons with phonons are recorded in the magnitude of @xmath16 .",
    "moreover , scattering of these particles by static imperfections like impurities , defects or grain boundaries are reflected .",
    "the aim of the present work is to derive the temperature dependent thermal conductivity of @xmath0 and to analyse the data with respect to the electronic - and the lattice thermal conductivity both in the normal and the sc state .",
    "moreover , we present resistivity and specific heat measurements in order to characterise the investigated sample .",
    "a @xmath0 sample of about 1.3 g was synthesized by direct reaction of the elements .",
    "the starting materials were elemental magnesium ( rod 99.9 mass % nominal purity ) and boron ( 99.5 % powder , crystalline , @xmath17 60 mesh , 99.5 mass % ) .",
    "the elements in a stoichiometric ratio were enclosed in a cylindric tantalum crucible sealed by arc welding under argon atmosphere .",
    "the tantalum crucible was then sealed in an iron cylinder and heated for one hour at @xmath18  c and two hours at @xmath19  c in a furnace .",
    "the sample characterized by x - ray diffraction show pure @xmath0 phase ; only one very weak peak due to extra phase has been found .",
    "the thermal conductivity measurement was performed in a flow cryostat on a cuboid - shaped sample ( length : about 1 cm , cross - section : about 2.5  mm@xmath20 ) , which was kept cold by anchoring one end of the sample onto a thick copper panel mounted on the heat exchanger of the cryostat .",
    "the temperature difference along the sample , established by electrical heating , was determined by means of a differential thermocouple ( au + 0.07 % fe / chromel ) .",
    "the measurement was performed under high vacuum and 3 shields mounted around the sample reduced the heat losses due to radiation at finite temperatures .",
    "the innermost of these shields is kept on the temperature of the sample via an extra heater maintained by a second temperature controller .",
    "resistivity data were taken from bar shaped samples applying a standard 4-probe d.c .",
    "technique at temperatures down to 0.5  k and in magnetic fields up to 12  t.    specific heat measurements were carried out on a sample of about 1  g in the temperature range 5k50k using a quasi adiabatic step heating technique .",
    "in order to give a direct proof of the sc bulk properties of our mgb@xmath3 sample prior to the transport measurements we checked the specific heat .",
    "these specific heat measurements performed in zero - field , 1 and 9  t showed reasonable agreement with results previously reported @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamic mean transition temperature @xmath21 of our sample is 37.5k .",
    "as already noted in the introduction there have been distinctly different and partly controversial conclusions suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite , although their raw data are in fair agreement with each other .",
    "therefore , we show in figure [ fig0 ] the temperature dependence of the electronic specific heat , @xmath22 versus @xmath23 obtained by subtracting the lattice heat capacity deduced from the 9 t specific heat data . of course , 9 t are insufficient to obtain a complete suppression of superconductivity in mgb@xmath3 , but there is already a large reduction of the order parameter combined with a dramatic broadening of the transition ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for comparison of 10 , 14 and 15 t data ) .",
    "thus , we obtained a sommerfeld coefficient of the normal - state electronic specific heat @xmath24(2 ) mj / molk@xmath20 by extrapolating the 9 t data in @xmath25 versus @xmath26 from 30  100 k@xmath20 to zero temperature which is already close to @xmath27 mj / molk@xmath20 obtained from the 14 and 16 t measurement by wang _",
    "et al . _",
    "the important point to emphasize in figure [ fig0 ] is the non bcs - like temperature dependence of the sc - state electronic specific heat .",
    "in fact , we observed a similar deviation from a simple bcs temperature dependence ( solid line , figure [ fig0 ] ) as previously reported by wang _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite ( @xmath28 $ ] for @xmath29 ) .",
    "this discrepancy is supposed to be indicative for the opening of an additional gap below about 10k .",
    "the solid line in figure 1 indicates that a fraction of electrons corresponding to a normal state @xmath30 mj / molk@xmath20 is tentatively accounted for by the bcs - fit with @xmath31 while a second fraction corresponding to @xmath32 mj / molk@xmath20 contributes to the smaller gap opening at temperatures well below @xmath33    to further screen the quality of the sample , temperature and magnetic field dependent resistivity measurements @xmath34 were performed from 0.5  k up to room temperature . shown in figure [ fig1 ] ( right axis )",
    "is @xmath35 at zero field .",
    "the transition into the sc state occurs at @xmath36  k , which is in fine agreement with already published data .",
    "the rrr ratio of this polycrystalline sample is about 6 .",
    "the resistivity behaviour in the normal state region matches a dependence according to @xmath37 with the residual resistivity @xmath38 and the coefficient @xmath39 .",
    "a @xmath26 behaviour of @xmath35 was recently reported @xcite and it seems to reflect interactions between charge carriers .",
    "a study of the hall coefficient implies that electrical transport is dominated by holes @xcite .",
    "the value of the coefficient @xmath40 , however , is significantly smaller than that known e.g. , for highly correlated electron systems , but seems to reflect the modest density of states at fermi energy @xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned that other power laws with an exponent close to 3 were reported for sintered material of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "measurements of the resistivity down to 0.5  k and in fields up to 12  t indicate that @xmath41 is well above that limit .",
    "interestingly , the transition region becomes much broader with increasing fields , but different values of imprinted currents ( from 5 to 40 ma ) do not change the width of the transition .",
    "the temperature dependent thermal conductivity @xmath15 of @xmath0 is shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the overall behaviour of @xmath42 is typical of an intermetallic compound where scattering on static imperfections prohibits a pronounced maximum to occur , as it is the case in pure and simple metals .",
    "moreover , the absolute magnitude appears to be of that order , as usually found for intermetallics .",
    "anomalous behaviour of @xmath16 in the proximity of @xmath1 is not observed and a local maximum or a pronounced shoulder below @xmath1 do not occur in the investigated sample .",
    "generally , the total thermal conductivity of metals consists of a sum of an electronic contribution @xmath43 and a lattice contribution @xmath44 : @xmath45 in order to separate both contributions from the total measured effect , the wiedemann - franz law is applied , assumed to be valid , at least , in simple metals .",
    "this model relates the electrical resistivity @xmath46 with the electronic contribution to the thermal conductivity @xmath43 and can be expressed as @xmath47 where @xmath48  @xmath49 is the lorenz number .",
    "using equation [ eq1 ] and taking into account the appropriate values of the electrical resistivity in the normal state region of @xmath0 ( compare figure [ fig1 ] , right axis ) allows to split @xmath15 into @xmath50 ( dashed line , figure [ fig1 ] ) and @xmath44 ( dashed - dotted line , figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this type of analysis indicates that both contributions are almost equal in the entire temperature range of the normal state region of @xmath0 .    according to matthiessen s rule",
    "both @xmath43 and @xmath44 are limited owing to various scattering processes , which can be expressed in terms of a thermal resistivity @xmath51 . in the case of non - magnetic materials , the following temperature dependence of the electronic contribution to the total measured quantity",
    "is assumed to be valid @xcite : @xmath52 where the subscripts ( e,0 ) and ( e , ph ) refer to interactions of the conduction electrons with static imperfections and thermally excited phonons , respectively ; @xmath53 and @xmath54 are material constants .",
    "equation [ eq2 ] allows to detemine @xmath55 and @xmath56 . shown in figure [ fig2 ]",
    "is the electronic thermal resistivity @xmath57 of @xmath0 displayed in the normal state region up to about 80  k. the solid line is a least squares fit of the data according to equation [ eq2 ] and the dashed and the dashed - dotted lines represent @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "thus , the deduced parameters are @xmath58 and @xmath59 . obviously from figure [ fig2 ] ,",
    "the scattering of electrons with static imperfections of the crystal becomes dominant as the temperature approaches @xmath1 .",
    "the relative weight of @xmath43 and @xmath44 at the sc transition temperature @xmath1 , as defined from the wiedemann franz law , also serves to determine the temperature dependence of @xmath43 and subsequently of @xmath44 below @xmath1 .",
    "since within the bcs theory , cooper pairs do not carry heat and entropy , the scattering terms of equation [ eq2 ] have to be modified in order to account for the decreasing number of unpaired electrons .",
    "in the sc state , the thermal resistivity @xmath60 can be represented as @xmath61 with @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "the functions @xmath63 and @xmath64 were calculated repeatedly and agree well with experimental findings @xcite . in the dirty limit of a superconductor , the first term of equation [ eq3 ]",
    "dominates , i.e. , @xmath65 . in terms of the brt theory",
    "@xcite @xmath66 is a universal function of @xmath67 , dependent on the value - and the temperature dependence of the sc gap @xmath68 .    on the contrary ,",
    "clean limit superconductors are dominated by the second term of equation [ eq3 ] , revealing @xmath69 .",
    "geilikman et al .",
    "@xcite have calcutated and tabulated @xmath64 which yields again a universal behaviour on @xmath67 . differently to scattering on imperfections , @xmath70 in the bcs limit increases initially with decreasing values of @xmath67 in spite of a rapid decrease of electronic excitations .",
    "a maximum occurs at @xmath71 with @xmath72 .",
    "various high temperature superconductors are found to exhibit a maximum in @xmath16 below @xmath1 and thus the origin of that feature is , at least partly , attributed to a significant scattering strength of electrons on thermally excited lattice vibrations ( compare e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] evidences that slighty above @xmath1 , @xmath55 exceeds @xmath56 by more than one order of magnitude and contributes at this temperature about 95  % to @xmath73 .",
    "this implicitely favours a description of the thermal conductivity of @xmath0 based on scattering of electrons on impurities .",
    "nevertheless , for the present analysis of the data both terms of equation [ eq3 ] are considered in order to analyse the electronic contribution to the total thermal conductivity .",
    "taking into account the functions @xmath63 and @xmath64 and the numerical values of @xmath53 and @xmath54 allows us to determine @xmath74 below @xmath1 ( compare figure [ fig3 ] , panel ( a ) ) .",
    "@xmath74 decreases with decreasing temperature and is primarily determined by the brt function @xmath63 .",
    "the difference @xmath75 represents the phonon - originated thermal conductivity @xmath76 in the sc state .",
    "the latter appears to be larger in the sc state than @xmath74 . for temperatures @xmath77 , the lattice thermal conductivity of @xmath0 becomes dominant",
    "this nicely agrees with theoretical considerations @xcite .",
    "the lattice term @xmath76 is constrained by various scattering processes ; among them are interactions of the phonons with electrons , point defects , dislocations or sheetlike faults .    to account for observed deviations of the sc gap of @xmath0 from the bcs theory , the experimental data from tunnel experiments on @xmath78 and @xmath79 @xcite have been used to modify the function @xmath63 and thus @xmath80 .",
    "the smaller the value of @xmath81 with respect to the bcs theory , the less steep is the decrease of @xmath63 when the temperature is lowered . since @xmath82 of @xmath0 as obtained from that study ( @xmath83 , @xcite ) is well below the bcs value ( @xmath84 ) , @xmath74 - in this type of analysis - becomes larger in the sc state down to @xmath85 .",
    "still , @xmath86 .",
    "taking @xmath76 as derived from the bcs - like gap , however , provides a slightly smoother crossover from the sc - to the normal state region of @xmath0 .",
    "panel ( b ) of figure [ fig3 ] shows the temperature dependent thermal resistivity @xmath87 .",
    "here , the data derived from the bcs model are used .",
    "obviously , scattering of electrons by phonons in the sc state contributes just a fraction to the thermal resistivity @xmath88 , and therefore @xmath80 is the most significant term below @xmath1 .",
    "this , of course , will not change if the actual dependence of @xmath14 is considered .",
    "the measurement of the thermal conductivity of @xmath0 reveals no pronounced anomaly at @xmath89 and furthermore no local maximum occurs at temperatures well below @xmath1 .",
    "such a behaviour is most likely caused by the dominance of electron ( hole ) scattering on static imperfections present in the investigated @xmath0 sample .",
    "in fact , an analysis based on the brt model and the model of geilikman evidences that @xmath80 is the predominant term . beside the classical bcs behaviour of the sc gap",
    ", an attempt was made to incorporate the actual gap behaviour reported for @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the subsequent analysis shows that the electronic contribution to the thermal conductivity becomes larger than in the former case .",
    "the application of the wiedemann franz law to the experimental data indicates that both the electronic - and the lattice contribution to the total thermal conductivity are almost of the same size over a large temperature range .",
