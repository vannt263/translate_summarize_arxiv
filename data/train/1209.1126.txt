    "integer quantum hall phases , the first topological insulating phases to be discovered @xcite , are realized by applying a large uniform magnetic field to a quasi - ideal two - dimensional electron gas , as formed in layered semiconductors structures .",
    "the presence of a uniform magnetic field is not , however , a necessary condition to produce quantum hall states , as first realized by haldane @xcite .",

    "although the magnetic flux through an elementary cell of the honeycomb lattice is zero , a staggered magnetic field present within this cell locally breaks time - reversal symmetry .",

    ", the haldane model belongs to the class a of chern insulators , which are topologically equivalent to the standard quantum hall states . the haldane model has not been directly realized in solid - state systems , due to the somewhat artificial structure of the staggered magnetic field .",

    "interestingly , if the bulk gap is closed , we find that the winding number measured from a tof absorption image might still depict a stable plateau when varying the microscopic parameters , under the condition that the fermi energy is exactly tuned at the gap closing point . in this work",
