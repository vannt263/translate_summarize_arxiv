    "we utilize two datasets for this study , the first of which is a part of the wef report on global risks released in 2013 and available at @xcite .",
    "the report defines @xmath0 global risks ( see @xcite for their detailed definitions ) that are systemic , that is they `` breakdown in an entire system , as opposed to breakdowns in individual parts and components '' @xcite .",
    "as pointed our in @xcite , each of these risks is a network itself .",
    "together they represent a network of networks that are prone to catastrophic cascades of failures @xcite .",
    "these failures are binary in nature , since they either manifest themselves or not ( even though the size , range and economic impact of each manifestation may vary from one manifestation to another ) .",
    "the wef report on global risks @xcite includes expert assessments of the likelihood of each risk materialization in the next decade and of the influence of each risk materialization on other risks .",
    "each expert defines these likelihoods by numerical value ranging from @xmath1 ( lowest likelihood ) to @xmath2 ( highest likelihood ) using integers and mid - points between integers within this range .",
    "thus , although not explicitly stated , the assessment of risk materialization likelihoods by the experts was done on a quantitative scale with a resolution corresponding to probability increments of @xmath3 .",
    "the averages and standard deviations of the expert likelihood values for each risk are also provided in the dataset .",
    "thanks to high quality and diversity of the experts participating in this crowdsourced assessment , the margins of error are small .",
    "this is demonstrated in table 3 , appendix 2 , page 66 of @xcite that lists the average likelihood and impact scores and shows that their margins of error ( based on a 95% confidence level ) vary from 1% to 2% of the average score values .",
    "the detailed analysis of the data collected in the dataset is provided in appendices 1 and 2 of @xcite .",
    "we denote the average of assessments for risk @xmath4 by @xmath5 .",
    "the dataset provides a list of pairs of risks , aggregated from expert selections of up to ten most influential pairs , such that both risks in each pair are perceived as having influence on each other .",
    "the weight of influence for each pair of the selected nodes is also listed and it represents the number of experts that chose the corresponding pair as influential . in the risk network ,",
    "the selected pairs are represented as connected .",
    "we selected the model which uses just binary value representing whether two nodes are connected or not since this information yielded the same maximum expectation when optimized using historical data as the models that use the weights of connections .",
    "accordingly , we designate a binary variable @xmath6 to each pair of risks @xmath7 that is @xmath1 if the pair appears at least once in the concatenated lists of the experts , and @xmath8 otherwise .",
    "thus , @xmath6 captures some overall _ association _ between risks @xmath4 and @xmath9 . by definition @xmath10 .",
    "there are @xmath11 bidirectional edges defined that way , thus , the average degree of each node is relatively high , @xmath12 edges per node .",
    "the entire global risk graph can be modeled as a stochastic block model @xcite with probability @xmath13 of the edge existing between two risks in the same group @xmath14 ( this probability differs from group to group ) while connections between nodes from two different risk groups , @xmath15 , are drawn with unique probability @xmath16 .",
    "the values of these probabilities for the wef global risk graph are shown in fig .",
    "[ rgdistr ] and  [ networkviz ] .",
    "the adjacency matrix of this graph is denoted @xmath17 , and its binary element @xmath18 is @xmath1 if and only if edge @xmath7 exists .",
    "we express the probabilities of risk materialization in terms of the @xmath5s and @xmath6s obtained from the wef dataset and the parameters of our model .    in order to optimize parameters for our model , we require a time series of risk materialization events over a contiguous period .",
    "we collected data on the materialization of each of the @xmath19 risks over the period @xmath20 by systematically surveying news , magazine and academic articles and websites identified using targeted queries on google , as well as wikipedia entries pertinent to specific risk materialization events . for brevity",
    ", we refer to this dataset as the _ historical _ dataset .",
    "overall , it provides @xmath21 data points for tuning the system parameters .",
    "the failure dynamics of the global risk network can be modeled using alternating renewal processes ( arp ) @xcite , which were initially used for engineered systems , but recently have been applied to science and economic applications @xcite .",
    "nodes under arp alternate between normal state and failure state , and the corresponding events of failure activation and recovery are responsible for the state transitions .",
    "typically , these events are assumed to be triggered by the non - homogeneous poisson processes ( i.e. poisson processes with time dependent intensities ) @xcite . in our systems ,",
    "use of the poisson distribution is justified because each failure represents a systemic risk that can be triggered by many elementary events distributed all over the globe .",
    "such triggering distorts any local temporary patterns of events ( such as periodic weather related local disasters in some regions of the globe ) .",
    "moreover , the time - dependence of intensity of risk activation is the results of influence that active risks exert on passive risks connected to them .",
    "accordingly , each risk at time @xmath22 is either in state @xmath1 ( materialized or _ active _ ) or state @xmath8 ( not materialized or _ inactive _ ) .    in a traditional arp , there are two directly observable processes , one of risk activation and the other of recovery from the active risk .",
    "however , in our model , we introduce two latent processes that together represent the risk activation process .",
    "as explained later , we use the expectation - maximization algorithm @xcite to find model parameters that make it optimally match historical data .",
    "consequently , we assume that changes in the state of each risk result from events generated by three types of poisson processes .",
    "first , for a risk @xmath4 , given that it is in state @xmath8 , its _ spontaneous _ or _ internal _ materialization is a poisson process with intensity @xmath23 . similarly , given the risk in state @xmath1 , its recovery from this state , and therefore transition to state @xmath8 , is a poisson process with intensity @xmath24 . finally , given that risks @xmath4 is in state @xmath8 , and @xmath9 in state @xmath1 are connected , the materialization of risk @xmath4 due to the _ external _ influence of risk @xmath9 is a poisson process with intensity @xmath25 .",
    "we assume that each of these processes is independent of each other .",
    "we also evaluated models in which recovery is represented by two latent processes , one of internal recovery and the other of recovery induced by either the connected passive or active risks . in both cases ,",
    "the optimal intensity of the externally induced recovery was @xmath8 .",
    "thus , the simpler model with just internal recovery is used as it yields the same results as the more complex models using latent processes for recovery .",
    "the model is similar to a model of house fires in a city , where some houses burn alone from a self - started fire , but others are ignited by the burning neighboring houses . yet , the recovery , that is rebuilding of a burnt house , is independent of the state of its neighboring houses .",
    "denoting by @xmath26 the probability at time @xmath22 that the state of a risk @xmath4 at that time is @xmath1 , we can express the expected number of risks materialized at time @xmath22 as the sum of all @xmath26 s , each of which is defined by the following ordinary differential equation ( ode ) : @xmath27 checking stability , we conclude that this system of non - linear odes has only one unique stable point in the feasible range @xmath28 , which can easily be found numerically .",
    "moreover , this system of odes for a fully connected graph when the intensities @xmath29 of the three poisson processes are independent of the node on which they operates , and for all nodes starting in the same initial condition @xmath30 has the analytic solution of the form @xmath31 , where @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "this solution tends asymptotically to @xmath35 .    for nearly all events that we consider here ,",
    "it is difficult to assign precise starting and ending times for their periods of materialization .",
    "thus , it is more proper to consider a bernoulli process in which the time unit ( and also time step of the model evolution ) is one calendar month ( we ignore the minor numerical imprecision arising from the fact that calendar months have different numbers of days ) .",
    "consequently , all events starting in the same month are considered to be starting simultaneously .",
    "hence , at each time step @xmath22 , each risk @xmath4 is associated with a binary state variable @xmath36 .",
    "the state of the entire set of risks at time @xmath22 can therefore be represented by a state vector @xmath37 .",
    "thus , the dynamics progresses by assuming that at each time step @xmath38 :    1 .",
    "a risk @xmath4 that was inactive at time @xmath39 materializes internally with probability @xmath40 .",
    "2 .   a risk @xmath9 that was active at time @xmath39 causes a connected to it risk @xmath4 that was inactive at time @xmath39 to materialize with probability @xmath41 .",
    "a risk @xmath4 that was active at time @xmath39 continues its materialization with probability @xmath42 .",
    "it is easy to show that for real time @xmath22 measured in finite time units ( months in our case ) , the poisson process assumption for events results in a probability @xmath43 of an event happening in at most @xmath44 time units which is identical to the assumed bernoulli process .",
    "the advantage of the latter process is that in each step the probability of event is known , simplifying maximum likelihood evaluation of the model parameters . finally , the dynamics described above imply that the state of the system at time @xmath22 depends only on its state at time @xmath39 , and therefore the evolution of the state vector @xmath37 is markovian .    given the probabilities of internal materialization , external influence and internal continuation , that is just 1 minus the probability of recovery",
    ", the probability of a transition in a risk s state between consecutive time steps can be written in terms of these probabilities : @xmath45    where @xmath46 represents the risks that are active at time @xmath22 , and @xmath47 is the probability that risk @xmath4 transitions between time @xmath39 and @xmath22 from state @xmath48 to state @xmath49 , or in other words @xmath50 and @xmath51 .    the mapping of the poisson process intensities into the expert assessments is described in the methods section . each of the probabilities of bernoulli processes is mapped onto the probability obtained from expert assessment of likelihood of risk failure by single - parameter formula .",
    "we find the values of the model parameters that optimize the model match with the historical data , while we use expert assessments to individualize probabilities of bernoulli processes for each risk .",
    "in essence , the expert assessments are defining those probabilities for each risk in relations to probabilities for other risks , while model parameters map performance of all risks onto historical data . by distinguishing between internal and external materialization factors ,",
    "the mapping of parameters onto historical data enables us also to decompose risk materializations into these two categories .",
    "once the mapping is done , the model is complete and can be used to evaluate global risk dynamics .    from several alternative models discussed in methods section",
    ", we discuss below the best performing network model which uses all three parameters , and the disconnected model which sets the value of probability of influence of a risk materialization on any other risk to zero , effectively isolating risk materializations from each other .      here , we investigate the relative importance of different risks .",
    "first , in analogy with epidemic studies , we calculate the _ contagion potential _ of individual risks , i.e. , the mean number of materializations that a risk induces given that it alone has materialized . for risk @xmath4 ,",
    "the exact expression for this quantity is :    @xmath52    where @xmath53 refers to the total number of risks .",
    "this expression assumes that risks other than @xmath4 can only be activated through the influence of risk @xmath4 and not internally .",
    "figure  [ networkviz ] shows a visualization of the network capturing the contagion potentials as well as the internal failure probabilities in the network model ( the mapping of node indices to the risks is provided in table  [ risk - mapping ] ) .",
    "as illustrated , the internal failure probability does not strictly show a positive correlation with contagion potential .",
    "hence , a frequently materializing risk does not necessarily inflict the most harm to the system as a result of its influence on other risks .",
    "for example , although risk @xmath54 -  cyber attacks \" has a relatively high probability of internal materialization , its contagion potential is low . in contrast ,",
    "risk @xmath55 -  global governance failure \" has both a high probability of internal materialization and a high contagion potential .",
    "however , most striking is the fact that risk @xmath56 - `` severe income disparity '' has both the highest internal materialization probability and the highest contagion potential .",
    "this is particularly notable in the light of recent claims that income disparity in the united states is the highest in over eight decades @xcite .",
    "the five risks with the highest contagion potentials are : @xmath56 -  severe income disparity \" , @xmath1 -  chronic fiscal imbalances \" , @xmath57 - `` rising greenhouse gas emissions '' , @xmath58 -  water supply crises \" , and @xmath59 - `` failure of climate change adaptation '' . when ranked purely by raw likelihood values",
    "@xmath5 ( or equivalently by the internal failure probabilities @xmath60 ) , the only change is on the fifth position , where risk @xmath59 is replaces by risk @xmath61 -  mismanagement of population ageing \" moves up from eleventh position to fifth .",
    ".**mapping of indices to risks used throughout the paper * * [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "to summarize , in this study we have presented a method of obtaining a quantitative picture of the global risk network , starting from the qualitative observations provided by @xmath62 wef experts .",
    "we assume a three parameter network model for the propagation of risk materialization ( representing the corresponding network node failures ) , and obtain maximum likelihood values for the parameters using historical data on risk materialization .",
    "our model was built upon expert assessments available in the wef report which enabled the construction of a detailed and heterogeneous weighted network of risks . as we show , ignoring network effects ( i.e. the disconnected model ) or ignoring specific heterogeneities in the failure likelihoods and influence ( i.e. the uniform model ) yielded poor results in comparison to the network model .",
    "this underscores the importance of the expert assessments in building a model capable of matching the available activity data well , and therefore yielding reliable insights .",
    "we have also found the greatest strength of expert assessments , which is nearly perfect forecast of aggregate failure probabilities of different risks , but also those assessments greatest weakness , which is inability to separate external risk materialization probabilities form internal ones .",
    "we have developed an approach in which by selecting proper model parameters and using maximum likelihood estimation to find optimal model parameters , we are able to do such separation .    we have uncovered the global risk network dynamics and measured its resilience , stability , and risks contagion potential , persistence , and roles in cascades of failures .",
    "we have identified risks most detrimental to system stability and measured the adverse effects of risk interdependence and the materialization of risks in the network . according to these studies ,",
    "the most detrimental is risk @xmath56 -severe income disparity \" .",
    "other risks that play a dominant role due to either their contagion potential or their persistent materialization are : @xmath1 -  chronic fiscal imbalances \" , @xmath55 -  global governance failure \" , @xmath63 -  pervasive entrenched corruption \" , @xmath59 -  failure of climate change adaptation \" , @xmath57 -  rising greenhouse gas emissions \" , and @xmath58 -  water supply crises \" .",
    "utilizing the complete network model generated using the wef data provides a much more detailed picture of the threat posed by different risks than the one obtained by simply relaying only on their failure - likelihood @xmath5 values and using the disconnected model .",
    "additionally , our analysis demonstrates that the carrying capacity of the network i.e. the typical activity expected in the network given the current parameters , is about @xmath64 risks or @xmath65 of the total number of network nodes , of which four are persistently chosen from a subset of seven risks ( see figure  [ persistencenormal ] ) . aiming to reduce this overall carrying capacity",
    "could potentially be an overarching goal of global risk minimization .",
    "there are several prospects for extending the model that we presented here and its further analysis .",
    "first , obtaining more robust historical estimates of risk materialization may help us improve the fitting of the model .",
    "secondly , it will be beneficial to account for slow evolution of network parameters in time .",
    "this change in network characterization will be captured by a model through expert data provided in yearly wef reports , resulting in time dependent @xmath5s and @xmath6s .",
    "furthermore , the accuracy of the model could possibly be improved by assuming the existence of different dynamics for chronic risks as compared to sporadic risks .    from a larger perspective",
    ", our attempt here has been to utilize data crowdsourced from experts towards gaining a quantitative picture of the network of global risks , which in turn has yielded some actionable insights .",
    "the network by definition has risks of varying complexity , which arguably makes the risk mitigation process more involved for some risks than for others .",
    "in such a scenario , our quantification of the relative impacts of different risks could provide a valuable guide to any cost - benefit analysis involved in the design of policies or strategies aimed at global risk minimization .",
    "the ideal next step given the insights provided by our model would be for domain experts to provide tailor - made recommendations for the pertinent risks , such that the likelihood of systemic failures is strongly curbed .",
    "the effect of such recommendations can also be tested using our model .",
    "we therefore believe that the contribution of this paper is to implement the crucial step that lies between the gathering of crowdsourced data and the prescription of domain - specific recommendations .",

    "<S> however , in addition to the risk of cascading failures being present within a particular domain ( e.g. , the network of financial institutions ) , there are also risks arising because of the coupling between systems in diverse domains @xcite . indeed , the primary thesis behind many societal collapses in the history of mankind is that of a cascade of diverse risks being materialized @xcite . examples of such cross - domain failure cascades include the collapse of the society on easter island stemming from deforestation that led to agricultural and economic instabilities and civil unrest , and the demise of the populations of the pitcairn and henderson islands caused by an environmental catastrophe of their common but geographically distant trading partner of mangareva . </S>",
