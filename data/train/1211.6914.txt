    "understanding the microscopic mechanisms dominating the mechanical response of viscoelastic liquids and disordered solids remains an open and challenging problem of fundamental nature in the material sciences @xcite .",
    "approaching vitrification , the viscous relaxation time increases from microscopic values characteristic for dilute or high - temperature systems to arbitrarily large values which easily exceed the experimental measurement time .",
    "thus , already very small externally - applied flow rates can compete with the intrinsic structural relaxation and can be used to gain deep insights .",
    "colloids recently have moved into the focus as they make possible microscopic investigations of the shear - driven particle rearrangements close to the glass transition ; for example @xcite and @xcite employed confocal microscopy and @xcite light scattering .",
    "moreover , the nonlinear rheology of colloidal dispersions is of interest in itself and for many technological applications @xcite .",
    "slightly polydisperse colloids , which mimic hard spheres , have repeatedly been employed as a most simple model system exhibiting glassy arrest where the nonlinear rheology can be studied in detail ; see e.g.  the recent works by @xcite and @xcite which provide access to the broader literature .",
    "the transient response of a viscoelastic material to shear deformation which is switched - on at time zero and then increases with a constant shear rate ( start - up flow ) provides detailed insight into the time - dependent viscoelasticity .",
    "while this is a familiar rheological technique in soft materials @xcite , it was also used by @xcite to investigate metallic glasses , with broadly similar findings , raising the exciting question about the fundamental relations between hard and soft glasses . in simulations of glasses at very low temperatures , individual rearrangements which cause stress relaxation upon shear deformation could be identified and studied by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "intriguingly , already for small deformations ( strains ) , the stress in small systems does not increase linearly but exhibits characteristic saw - teeth indicative of the local shear rearrangements .",
    "their microscopic nature in disordered materials is not as well understood as in crystalline materials .",
    "detailed discussions have up to now only been possible within macroscopic nonequilibrium thermodynamics ; in the shear transformation zone theory by @xcite and in older flow - defect theories by @xcite . at higher temperatures or at not too high densities in colloidal dispersions , there appears to be an initial linear regime in the stress versus strain curve , whose slope measures the elastic shear modulus of the amorphous solid material @xcite . at long times after switching on the shear rate , when the strain accumulates to the order of 100% , the system approaches a steady state where an unique , history independent stress can be observed , as verified in detail by @xcite .",
    "the resulting flow curves ( viz .  stationary stress as function of shear rate ) exhibit a dynamic yield stress whenever the quiescent state is glass like @xcite .",
    "inbetween the linear small strain and the asymptotic steady regime , the stress versus strain curve often exhibits a maximum ( stress overshoot ) which sometimes is taken as measure for a kind of yield stress. yet , while the linear response and stationary state of glassy materials often can be considered simple in the sense that it is homogeneous ( viz .",
    "exhibits a spatially constant shear rate ) and history independent ( viz .",
    "independent of the waiting time inbetween preparation of the state and switch - on of the shear ) , the intermediate stress - overshoot regime is more complicated . in gel - like colloidal dispersions , @xcite observed inhomogeneous flow ( wall slip and shear banding ) beyond the linear regime causing the stress overshoot when the material failed locally .",
    "inhomogeneous flow is quite prominent in shear - driven aggregated dispersions as reviewed recently by @xcite , and has also been obtained in theoretical approaches to stress - strain curves like in the flow - defect approaches by @xcite and in the mesoscopic soft glassy rheology model by @xcite .",
    "the soft glassy rheology approach by @xcite and the nonlinear langevin approach by @xcite ( recently reviewed by @xcite ) also predict the second mentioned subtle property of the stress overshoot , namely its dependence on the time since preparation of the glassy sample ( viz .  aging ) .",
    "this has been investigated in detail in a paste colloidal suspension by @xcite , and in computer simulations of a glass forming lennard - jones mixture by @xcite , who also observed shear banding in flows with narrow rheometer gaps .    in the present contribution ,",
    "we study the stress versus strain curve of a model colloidal dispersion , of a simulated binary mixture of hard disks , and in microscopic mode coupling theory in order to explore the possibility for _ a stress overshoot arising generically in viscoelastic materials in homogeneous flow and independent of the age of the sample_. while stress overshoots under such simple conditions are known in polymeric materials and from a number of the mentioned theoretical approaches , we focus on the question whether an approach ( viz .",
    "mode coupling theory ) starting from the particle interactions and describing broadly visco - plastic phenomena , can capture it .",
    "we present age - independent data from experiments and simulations below and above the glass transition packing fraction of mode coupling theory , and compare with theory .",
    "the experimental system is a well studied slightly polydisperse core - shell microgel dispersion , which allows for a good control of the equilibration excluding aging - effects .",
    "its flow curves and linear shear moduli close to the glass transition were determined by @xcite , and its large strain amplitude oscillatory stresses by @xcite .",
    "while the homogeneity of the flow in the system could not yet be investigated , the confocal microscopy study by @xcite established a homogeneous flow profile in a fluid colloidal dispersion and also showed that the stress overshoot is related to the single particles mean squared displacements .",
    "brownian dynamics simulations of a binary mixture of hard disks in two dimensions are included as there the flow profile can be recorded and homogeneity can be tested .",
    "previous investigations by @xcite determined the glass transition density of the system , which we use to exclude age dependences . moreover a number of rheological studies were already performed on this computer glass former @xcite .",
    "the theoretical investigations use the first principles mode coupling theory by @xcite and coworkers generalized to flowing systems in the integration through transients approach suggested by @xcite .",
    "its results for two - dimensional hard disks were compared to the brownian dynamics simulations by @xcite and @xcite , and in the present contribution are the basis for the development of a simplified schematic model .",
    "its advantage is the possibility to jointly analyze data of the linear shear moduli , flow curves and stress vs strain curves in a variety of glass forming fluids , whose microscopic description is yet out of reach .",
    "it generalizes a schematic model from the literature , which has already successfully been used to capture flow curves and linear and nonlinear moduli from different glass formers , including of the experimental system we investigate @xcite .",
    "the main outcome of our investigations will be that the transient shear stress after switching on a fixed shear rate at time zero generically exhibits a maximum before settling on the stationary flow - curve value .",
    "it arises from negative stress correlations that build up when the intrinsic structural relaxation gets strongly affected by the shear driving . as discussed by @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the transient dynamics initially follows the quiescent one , while it coincides with the stationary dynamics under flow at long times .",
    "inbetween , it exhibits super - diffusive motion and negative stress correlations , which are heralded by anisotropic structural correlations seen in simulations by @xcite and @xcite .    the manuscript is organized as follows : in sect .",

    ", the affine deformation decorrelates the stress fluctuations so that the friction kernel is forced to decay to zero at long times .",
