    "the observed rate at which stars more massive than @xmath18 m@xmath2  explode as core - collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) can be used as a direct measure of the current star formation rate ( sfr ) , given a reasonable assumption for the initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "in fact , ccsne are beginning to be used as probes of the sfr at both low and high redshift ( _ e.g. _ cappellaro et al .",
    "1999 ; dahlen et al . 2004",
    "; cappellaro et al .",
    "2005 ) with the aim of providing a new independent measurement of the star formation history of the universe .",
    "a large fraction of the massive star formation at high-@xmath3 took place in luminous ( l@xmath4 @xmath5 10@xmath6 l@xmath2 ) and ultraluminous ( l@xmath4 @xmath5 10@xmath7 l@xmath2 ) infrared ( ir ) galaxies ( henceforth lirgs and ulirgs ) and their high sfrs can be expected to result in ccsn rates a couple of orders of magnitude higher than in ordinary field galaxies .",
    "however , most of the sne occurring in lirgs and ulirgs are likely to be obscured by large amounts of dust in the nuclear starburst environment and have therefore , even in the local universe , remained undiscovered by optical sn searches",
    ". the existence of hidden sn factories in the nuclei of lirgs and ulirgs has already been demonstrated by high - resolution radio observations .",
    "for example , vlbi observations of the nearby ulirg , arp  220 , have revealed luminous radio sne within its innermost @xmath1150 pc nuclear regions at a rate indicating a sfr high enough to power its entire ir luminosity ( lonsdale et al .",
    "2006 ; parra et al . 2006 ) .",
    "however , not all ccsne are likely to become luminous at radio wavelengths , and therefore radio searches for sne can only provide a lower limit for the real sn rates .    in the near - ir k - band the extinction is strongly reduced while the sensitivity of ground - based observations is still good , making searches for sne in starburst galaxies , lirgs and ulirgs more promising ( van buren et al .",

    "the sn was detected as a result of our k@xmath0-band search of highly obscured ccsne in a sample of 15 nearby lirgs and ulirgs using the naos conica ( naco ) ao system on the eso very large telescope ( vlt ) .",

    "the ao correction was performed using the visual wavefront sensor ( vis - wfs ) with a natural guide star of m@xmath12@xmath115 , 25 \" northeast from the science target .",
    "the observations were repeated on 2004 sept .",

    "we adopted the photometric zeropoints provided by eso for our nights of observations and estimate them to be accurate to @xmath170.03 magnitudes in comparison to 2mass data .",
    "since the sr changes as a function of the distance from the ao guide star , to measure the sn photometry with the associated uncertainties , we used two isolated bright stars lying , respectively , 12 `` and 38 '' from the guide star ( 7.1``n , 18.3''e and 5.8``s , 11.5''w of the galaxy k - band nucleus ) to provide a point spread function ( psf ) with a higher and lower sr compared to the actual sn .",
    "the two psfs were scaled to correspond to magnitudes ranging between 18.5 and 19.1 in steps of 0.1 .",
    "sources with each magnitude and psf were then simulated in the images at twenty different locations evenly distributed around the galaxy nucleus at the same offset as the real sn .",
    "the sources were added to the images one at a time before the images were aligned , matched and subtracted .",
    "the magnitudes for both the real and simulated sne were measured from each subtracted image using aperture photometry with a 0.15 `` aperture radius , and a sky annulus between 0.20 '' and 0.30 `` .",
    "we then estimated a magnitude for the sn by comparing its photometry with the mean of the counts measured for the 20 simulated sources with each magnitude and psf .",
    "this yielded sn magnitudes of m(k@xmath0 ) = 18.74 and 18.64 for sept .",
    "13 using the two different psfs , respectively .",
    "similarly , we obtained m(k@xmath0 ) = 18.66 and 18.72 for sept .",
    "we adopted the standard deviation ( @xmath15 ) of the 20 measurements as the uncertainty in our sn photometry , yielding @xmath15 = 0.12 and 0.09 for the two epochs , respectively . measuring with a 50% larger aperture and sky annulus gave very similar magnitudes as expected",
    "since the photometry is performed relative to the simulated sources , only the uncertainties were increased . during the sept .",
    "27 k@xmath0-band observation the airmass was high , resulting in a low sr and therefore wider psf for the images .",
    "for this epoch stronger residuals were also present in the subtracted images and we therefore excluded ten of the twenty simulated sources which were affected by much stronger residuals than the sn .",
    "for the sept .",
    "27 data we used an aperture radius of 0.30 '' , and a sky annulus between 0.40 `` and 0.50 '' .",
    "this yielded m(k@xmath0 ) = 18.82 and m(k@xmath0 ) = 18.99 with @xmath15 = 0.14 using the two psfs , respectively .",
    "we adopt the average of the magnitudes obtained with the two different psfs as the best estimate for the sn magnitude .",
    "the uncertainties were obtained as a quadrature sum of the @xmath15 value and the error in the zeropoint .      without a spectroscopic observation of the sn",
    "its confirmation and possible typing have to be based on photometry and other available information .",
    "an asteroid origin for the source was immediately ruled out since the images separated by 2 days show the sn in exactly the same position ( within @xmath170.02 `` ) .",
    "furthermore , the sn is still at precisely the same location in the 3rd epoch images , obtained 2 weeks from the discovery .",
    "below we model the near- to far - ir sed of and find a negligible contribution from an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) to its luminosity .",
    "also , the presence of an agn is not favoured by the x - ray results of risaliti et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and the fact that shows an ` h ii galaxy ' spectrum in the optical ( veilleux et al .",
    "1995 ) . therefore",
    ", an agn flare can be ruled out as origin for the source .",
    "a variable foreground star also provides a very improbable alternative explanation given the small field of view ( 42''@xmath1342 \" , _",
    "i.e. _ , 1/(3@xmath1310@xmath18 ) of the whole sky ) of our combined naco frames .",
    "for example , the likelihood of catching a foreground nova would be extremely small given the galactic nova rate of @xmath135 yr@xmath9 ( shafter 1997 ) .",
    "furthermore , a classical nova in would be several magnitudes fainter than the detected sn ( hachisu & kato 2006 ) .",
    "we , therefore , conclude that anything other than a sn origin for our source appears extremely unlikely .    to estimate the sfr for we compiled its 1 - 100 micron archival ( 2mass and iras ) photometry and fitted the resulting seds ( see fig .",
    "2 ) both with the starburst models of efstathiou _ et al . _",
    "( 2000 ) , and the cirrus model of efstathiou & rowan - robinson ( 2003 ) .",
    "the combination of the starburst and cirrus model provides a very good fit to the near- to far - ir sed and is consistent with a negligible contribution from an agn .",
    "the model assumes an exponentially decaying starburst with a time constant of 40 myrs and an age of 70 myrs , and an underlying 12.5 gyr old stellar population .",
    "the cirrus a@xmath12 is assumed to be 1.7 and the initial a@xmath12 of the molecular clouds that constitute the starburst is 100 .",
    "the sfr at the peak is 285 m@xmath2  yr@xmath9 , and 135 m@xmath2  yr@xmath9 when averaged over the duration of the starburst .",
    "we estimate a rest frame 8 - 1000 @xmath19 m luminosity of 5.8 @xmath13 10@xmath6 l@xmath2 and a bolometric luminosity of 6.5 @xmath13 10@xmath6 l@xmath2 for .    adopting the average sfr and assuming ccsn progenitors between 8 and 50 m@xmath2  and a salpeter imf with cut - offs at 0.1 and 125m@xmath2  ( see also mm01 ) ,",
    "we obtain a ccsn rate of @xmath11 yr@xmath9 for .",
    "we note that this ccsn rate also agrees with the model predictions of genzel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) for an exponentially decaying starburst with similar time constant , age and bolometric luminosity .",
    "recent observational evidence shows that the type ia sn ( sn ia ) rate is likely to depend on both the stellar mass and the mean sfr of their host galaxies ( see sullivan et al .",
    "2006 and references therein ) .",
    "the rate of sne ia associated with the old stellar population is not expected to be enhanced in compared with normal field galaxies but the rate associated with the recent star formation could be higher . this rate has been found to depend on the host galaxy sfr averaged over the last 500 myrs ( sfr@xmath20 ) according to @xmath14 @xmath13 10@xmath21 sne yr@xmath9 / sfr@xmath20 ( sullivan et al .",
    "2006 ) . using 135 m@xmath2  yr@xmath9 as an upper limit for sfr@xmath20 we obtain an upper limit for its sn ia rate of @xmath10.05 yr@xmath9 which is @xmath120@xmath13 smaller than the estimated ccsn rate .",
    "we therefore conclude that sn 2004ip was very likely a core - collapse event .    after correcting for a galactic extinction of a@xmath12 = 0.47 ( schlegel et al .",
    "1998 ) the absolute magnitude of the sn at the time of the discovery becomes m@xmath22 = @xmath23 ( before correcting for the host galaxy extinction ) . in fig .  3",
    ", we compare the photometry of the sn with template k - band light curves for ordinary and slowly - declining ccsne from mm01 .",
    "these templates comprise 2 and 3 linear components , respectively , and are based on the light curves of 11 ( type ii and ib / c ) and two ( the type iil sn 1979c and the type iin sn 1998s ) ccsne .",
    "the slow decliners are significantly more luminous than the ordinary events , even at early times , therefore requiring a larger host galaxy extinction to match the observations . assuming that the sn was discovered at the k - band maximum light , we need to dim the ordinary and slowly declining templates by a@xmath24 = 2.75 and 4.15 magnitudes , respectively , to match the observations . to estimate the lowest plausible extinction towards the sn we sought the latest possible sn epoch of discovery to match the templates .",
    "the time interval between the reference and discovery images was @xmath1130 days and the template light curves of mm01 have rise times of @xmath125 days to the k - band maximum light .",
    "the latest sn epoch of discovery assuming that the sn exploded soon after the observation of the reference image is therefore about 100 days past the k - band maximum light .",
    "we found that the ordinary and slowly - declining templates can match the observations at this epoch if a@xmath24 = 0.55 and 2.50 magnitudes , respectively . adopting the extinction law of rieke & lebofsky ( 1985 )",
    "the range of likely host galaxy extinction towards is therefore between about 5 and 40 magnitudes in a@xmath12 .",
    "the number of ccsne discovered in the infrared ( van buren et al . 1994b ; maiolino et al . 2002 ; mattila et al . 2005a , b ) is still rather small .",
    "however , these few events can have an important impact for the sn statistics when estimating the _ complete _ local ccsn rate including also the sne in the optically obscured parts of the galaxies . detecting ccsne directly in starburst galaxies over a range of ir luminosities",
    "( l@xmath25 = 10@xmath2610@xmath7 l@xmath2 ) is also vital for interpreting the results of the high - z ccsn searches since a large fraction of the massive star formation at high-@xmath3 took place in ir luminous galaxies .",
    "is the first reported supernova discovered using adaptive optics .",
    "this discovery demonstrates the great potential of the current 8-meter class telescopes equipped with ao correction in discovering sne from the innermost nuclear regions of lirgs and ulirgs .",
    "in addition , the next generation wide - field ao systems can be used for expanding near - ir sn searches to the high - z universe .",
    "near - ir - discovered sne in nuclear starbursts are not only important for sn rate estimates , they can also be used to estimate the amount and distribution of extinction within their host galaxies , and follow - up observations can provide us with a better understanding of the behaviour of sne within the dusty , high - density starburst environment . the extinction of up to 40 magnitudes in a@xmath12 estimated for is consistent with those derived towards the radio snrs in the nuclear ( central 500 pc ) regions of m  82 ( mm01 ) .",
    "we note that infrared space observatory ( iso ) studies ( genzel et al . 1998 ) indicate much higher extinctions of a@xmath12(mixed ) @xmath1 50 - 1000 towards the highly - excited mid - ir line - emitting innermost nuclear regions in lirgs and ulirgs .",
    "however , is located in a circumnuclear starburst at a 500 pc distance from the k@xmath0-band nucleus where the conditions could be expected to be similar to the m  82 nuclear environment .",
    "many of the sne exploding in the nuclear starburst environment can be expected to produce very luminous radio sne as a result of the interaction of the sn ejecta with a dense surrounding medium ( chevalier and fransson 2001 ) .",
    "in fact , the radio discovered sn 2000 ft ( colina et al .",
    "2001 ; alberdi et al .",
    "2006 ) in a circumnuclear starburst ring ( 600 pc from the nucleus ) of its lirg host ngc 7469 , showed a luminosity comparable to the brightest known radio sne .",
    "radio follow - up observation of and other sne discovered in lirgs and ulirgs in the future can therefore provide important information on their progenitor stars and on the conditions in the surrounding circumstellar medium .",
    "this work was supported by funds from the participating organisations of euryi and the ec sixth framework programme .",
