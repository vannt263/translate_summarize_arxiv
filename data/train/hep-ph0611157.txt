    "the theme of these lectures at the 46th course of the zakopane school is multi - particle production in hadronic collisions at high energies in the color glass condensate ( cgc ) effective field theory .",
    "there has been tremendous progress in our theoretical understanding in the seven years since one of the authors last lectured here . at that time",
    ", the author s lectures covered the state of the art ( in the cgc framework ) in both deeply inelastic scattering ( dis ) studies and in hadronic multi - particle production  @xcite .",
    "a sign of rapid progress in the field is that there were several talks and lectures at this school covering various aspects of this physics in dis alone .",
    "we will restrict ourselves here to developments in our understanding of multi - particle production in hadronic collisions .",
    "another significant development in the last seven years has been the large amount of data from the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at bnl , key features of which were nicely summarized in the white - papers of the experimental collaborations  @xcite culminating in the announcement of the discovery of a  perfect fluid \" at rhic .",
    "the exciting experimental observations were discussed here in the lectures of jacak  @xcite .",
    "the rhic data have had a tremendous impact on the cgc studies of multi - particle production .",
    "while we will discuss rhic phenomenology , and indeed specific applications of theory to data , our primary focus will be on attempts to develop a systematic theoretical framework in qcd to compute multi - particle production in hadronic collisions .",
    "some applications of the cgc approach to rhic phenomenology were also covered at this school by kharzeev as part of his lectures  @xcite . for recent comprehensive reviews ,",

    "the collider era in high energy physics has made possible investigations of qcd structure at a deep level in studies of multi - particle final states .",
    "much attention has been focused on the nature of multi - particle production in jets ; for a nice review , see refs .",
    "the problem is however very general .",
    "theoretical developments in the last couple of decades suggest that semi - hard particle production in high energy hadronic interactions is dominated by interactions between partons having a small fraction @xmath0 of the longitudinal momentum of the incoming nucleons . in the regge limit of small @xmath0 and",

    "fadin  kuraev",
    " lipatov ( bfkl ) evolution equation  @xcite predicts that parton densities grow very rapidly with decreasing @xmath0 . a rapid growth with @xmath0 , in the gluon distribution , for fixed @xmath3 ,",
    "was observed in the hera experiments  @xcite .",
    "( it is not clear however that the observed growth of the gluon distribution is a consequence of bfkl dynamics  @xcite . ) because the rapid growth in the regge limit corresponds to very large phase space densities of partons in hadronic wave functions , saturation effects may play an important role in hadronic collisions at very high energies  @xcite .",
    "these slow down the growth of parton densities relative to that of bfkl evolution and may provide the mechanism for the unitarization of cross - sections at high energies .",
    "the large parton phase space density suggests that small @xmath0 partons can be described by a classical color field rather than as particles @xcite .",
    "light cone kinematics ( more simply , time dilation ) further indicates that there is a natural separation in time scales , whereby the small @xmath0 partons are the dynamical degrees of freedom and the large @xmath0 partons act as static color sources for the classical field . in the mclerran ",
    "venugopalan ( mv ) model , the large color charge density of sources is given by the density of large @xmath0 partons in a big nucleus which contains @xmath4 valence quarks ( where @xmath5 is the atomic number of the nucleus ) . in this limit of strong color sources",
    ", one has to solve the non  linear classical yang - mills equations to obtain the classical field corresponding to the small @xmath0 parton modes .",
    "this procedure properly incorporates , at tree level , the recombination interactions that are responsible for gluon saturation . in the mv model ,",
    "the distribution of large @xmath0 color sources is described by a gaussian statistical distribution  @xcite .",
    "a more general form of this statistical distribution , for @xmath6 gauge theories , valid for large @xmath5 and moderate @xmath0 , is given in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the separation between large @xmath0 and small @xmath0 , albeit natural , is somewhat arbitrary in the mv model ; the physics should in fact be independent of this separation of scales .",
    "this property was exploited to derive a functional renormalization group ( rg ) equation , the jimwlk equation , describing the evolution of the gauge invariant source distributions to small @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "the jimwlk functional rg equation is equivalent to an infinite hierarchy of evolution equations describing the behavior of multi - parton correlations at high energies first derived by balitsky  @xcite .",
    "a useful ( and tremendously simpler ) large @xmath7 and large @xmath5 mean - field approximation independently derived by kovchegov  @xcite , is commonly known as the balitsky - kovchegov equation .",
    "the general effective field theory framework describing the non - trivial behavior of multi - parton correlations at high energies is often referred to as the color glass condensate ( cgc )  @xcite .",

    ", one must calculate the properties of multi - particle production for any particular configuration of sources . in this paper",
    ", we will assume that the former is known .",
    "all we require is that these sources ( as the rg equations tell us ) are strong sources , parametrically of the order of the inverse coupling constant , and are strongly time dependent .",
    "we will describe a formalism to compute multi - particle production for an arbitrary distribution of such sources  .",
    "these lectures are organized as follows . in the first lecture",
    ", we shall describe the formalism for computing particle production in a field theory coupled to strong time - dependent external classical sources .",
    "we will consider as a toy model a @xmath8 scalar theory , where @xmath9 is coupled to a strong external source .",
    "although the complications of qcd  such as gauge invariance  are very important , many of the lessons gained from this simpler scalar theory apply to studies of particle production in qcd .",
    "we will demonstrate that there is no simple power counting in the coupling constant @xmath10 for the probability @xmath11 to produce @xmath12 particles .",
    "a simple power counting however exists for moments of @xmath11 .",
    "we will discuss how one computes the average multiplicity and ( briefly ) the variance .",
    "with regard to the former , we will show how it can be computed to next - to - leading order in the multiplicity .",
    "we will also discuss what it takes to compute the generating function for the multiplicity distribution to leading order in the coupling .    in lecture",
    "ii , we will relate the formal considerations developed in lecture i , to the results of real time numerical simulations of the average multiplicity of gluons and quarks produced in heavy ion collisions .",
    "inclusive gluon production , to lowest order in the loop expansion discussed in lecture i , is obtained by solving the classical yang - mills equations for two color sources moving at the speed of light in opposite directions  @xcite .",
    "this problem has been solved numerically in  @xcite for the boost - invariant case .",
    "the multiplicity of quark - pairs is computed from the quark propagator in the background field of @xcite  it has been studied numerically in @xcite .",
    "a first computation for the boost non - invariant case has also been performed recently  @xcite .",
    "it was shown there that rapidity dependent fluctuations of the classical fields lead to the non  abelian analog of the weibel instability  @xcite , first studied in the context of electromagnetic plasmas .",
    "such instabilities may be responsible for the early thermalization required by phenomenological studies of heavy ion collisions .",
    "we will discuss how a better understanding of the small quantum fluctuations discussed in lecture i may provide insight into early thermalization .    in the third and final lecture",
    ", we will discuss how the formalism outlined in lecture i simplifies in the case of proton - nucleus collisions .",
    "( a similar simplification occurs in hadron - hadron collisions at forward / backward rapidities where large @xmath0 s in one hadron ( small color charge density ) and small @xmath0 in the other ( large color charge density ) are probed . ) at leading order in the coupling , lowest order in the proton charge density , and all orders in the nuclear color charge density , analytical results are available for both inclusive gluon and quark production   factorization breaks down even at leading order in pa collisions  @xcite . ] . in the former case ,",

    "( [ eq : li-1 ] ) would be an equality , and the vacuum - vacuum diagrams would be purely real , thereby only giving a pure phase for the vacuum - to - vacuum amplitude in eq .",
    "( [ eq : li-2 ] ) .",
    "they therefore do not contribute to the probabilities for producing particles .",
    "( [ eq : li-1 ] ) tells us that one has to be more careful in field theories with external sources . to illustrate how particle production works in such theories",
    ", we shall , for simplicity , consider a real scalar field with cubic self - interactions , coupled to an external source .",
    "( the lessons we draw carry over straightforwardly to qcd albeit their implementation is in practice significantly more complex . )",
    "the lagrangian density is @xmath34 note that the coupling @xmath10 in this theory has dimensions of the mass ; and that the theory is super - renormalizable in @xmath35 dimensions .",
    "the source densities @xmath36 can be envisioned as the scalar analogue of the sum of two source terms @xmath37 corresponding respectively in the cgc framework to the recoil - less color currents of the two hadronic projectiles .",
    "let us now consider how the perturbative expansion for such a theory looks like in weak coupling .",
    "the power of a generic simply connected diagram is given simply by @xmath38 where @xmath39 are the number of external lines , @xmath40 the number of loops and @xmath41 the number of sources .",
    "for vacuum  vacuum graphs , @xmath42 . as @xmath43 , the power counting for a theory with strong sources",
    "is given entirely by an expansion in the number of loops .",
    "in particular , at tree level ( @xmath44 ) , the vacuum  vacuum graphs are all of order @xmath45 .",
    "the tree graphs contributing to the connected vacuum - vacuum amplitude in eq .",

    "a vertex of type @xmath47 is the ordinary vertex and appears with a factor @xmath49 in feynman diagrams .",
    "a vertex of type @xmath48 is the opposite is real in an unitary theory , the vertex of type @xmath48 is also the complex conjugate of the vertex of type @xmath47 . ] of a @xmath47 vertex , and its feynman rule is @xmath50 . likewise , for insertions of the source @xmath32 , insertions of type @xmath47 appear with the factor @xmath51 while insertions of type @xmath48 appear instead with @xmath52 .",

    "the generalized set of diagrams therefore includes @xmath61 such diagrams if the original diagram had @xmath12 vertices and sources . using recursively the so - called `` largest time equation ''  @xcite ,",

    "it is important to note that cut connected vacuum - vacuum diagrams would be zero in the vacuum because energy can not flow from one side of the cut to the other in the absence of external sources .",
    "this is of course consistent with a pure phase in eq .",

    "are more sensitive to larger @xmath13 , we expect this discrepancy to show up in our studies of limiting fragmentation and indeed it does .",
    "taking this into account leads to more plausible extrapolations of fits of existing data to lhc energies .",
    "these lectures were delivered by one of us ( rv ) at the 46th zakopane school in theoretical physics .",
    "this school held a special significance because it coincided with the 70th birthday of andrzej bialas who is a founding member of the school .",
    "rv would like to thank michal praszalowicz for his excellent organization of the school .",
    "this work has drawn on recent results obtained by one or both of us in collaboration with h. fujii , k. fukushima , s. jeon , k. kajantie , t. lappi , l. mclerran , p. romatschke and a. stasto .",

    "<S> in the color glass condensate ( cgc ) effective field theory , when two large sheets of colored glass collide , as in a central nucleus - nucleus collision , they form a strongly interacting , non - equilibrium state of matter called the glasma . </S>",
    "<S> how colored glass shatters to form the glasma , the properties of the glasma , and the complex dynamics transforming the glasma to a thermalized quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) are questions of central interest in understanding the properties of the strongly interacting matter produced in heavy ion collisions . in the first of these lectures </S>",
    "<S> , we shall discuss how these questions may be addressed in the framework of particle production in a field theory with strong time dependent external sources . </S>",
    "<S> albeit such field theories are non - perturbative even for arbitrarily weak coupling , moments of the multiplicity distribution can in principle be computed systematically in powers of the coupling constant . </S>",
    "<S> we will demonstrate that the average multiplicity can be ( straightforwardly ) computed to leading order in the coupling and ( remarkably ) to next - to - leading order as well . </S>",
    "<S> the latter are obtained from solutions of small fluctuation equations of motion with _ retarded boundary conditions_. in the second lecture , we relate our formalism to results from previous 2 + 1 and 3 + 1 dimensional numerical simulations of the glasma fields . </S>",
    "<S> the latter show clearly that the expanding glasma is unstable ; small fluctuations in the initial conditions grow exponentially with the square root of the proper time . whether this explosive growth of small fluctuations leads to early thermalization in heavy ion collisions requires at present a better understanding of these fluctuations on the light cone . in the third and final lecture , motivated by recent work of biaas and jeabek  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we will discuss how the widely observed phenomenon of limiting fragmentation is realized in the cgc framework .    </S>",
