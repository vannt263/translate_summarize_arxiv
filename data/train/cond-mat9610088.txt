    "the connection between percolation and the ising model has been a popular subject for a long time .",
    "one considers so - called ising clusters made up of nearest - neighbor spins with the same spin value .",
    "the connectivity behavior of these clusters is called correlated site percolation , as the probability distribution of the percolating and non - percolating sites is a correlated one .",
    "the interest in this problem arose because these ising clusters were believed to have the same properties as the droplets in the droplet model@xcite , i.e.  they should diverge at the ising critical point with the same critical exponents as those of the ising model .",
    "it became clear that they did indeed diverge@xcite at the ising critical point , but not@xcite with ising exponents .",
    "an alternative cluster definition was needed to have clusters with the properties of droplets in the droplet model .",
    "these clusters , called coniglio - klein clusters@xcite , are defined by putting bonds between each pair of nearest neighbor up - spins , but now with a probability @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the ising coupling .",
    "not all bonds of the ising clusters appear in the coniglio - klein clusters , such that the latter are , in that sense , ` smaller ' than ising clusters .",
    "the coniglio - klein clusters display@xcite the right critical behavior : their diverge at the ising critical point , their linear size diverges as the ising correlation length , and the mean cluster size behaves as the susceptibility .",
    "both the ising clusters and the coniglio - klein clusters have their percolation point at the ising critical temperature , albeit with different critical behavior . the full picture of this cluster behavior emerged@xcite when the behavior of both types of clusters was identified with the phase diagram of the @xmath6-state dilute potts model in the limit @xmath7 .",
    "the tricritical point in this phase diagram describes the behavior of the ising clusters .",
    "this tricritical point falls in the same universality class as the ising critical point@xcite in the sense that the central charge is @xmath8 , but the critical exponents involved in the behavior of the ising clusters do not fit into the ka - table@xcite ; they correspond to half - integer values of the unitary grid .",
    "the coniglio - klein clusters are described by the @xmath9 state symmetric fixed point in this phase diagram .",
    "our motivation to reconsider the problem of correlated site percolation is not the droplet theory of the ising model but arises from a study of correlated resistor networks ; see further below . in this paper",
    ", we consider ising clusters that are made up of bonds with a larger percolation range , that is , bonds are placed between nearest neighbor up spins , but also between next- and further - neighboring pairs of equal spins .",
    "let us , throughout this paper , denote the clusters consisting of bonds between nearest and next - nearest neighbor spin pairs by nnn - clusters . in this language",
    "the ising clusters are nn - clusters .",
    "it is immediately clear that , if one considers bonds with a longer and longer percolation range , clusters get bigger and the percolation threshold eventually will move to a temperature @xmath0 that is lower than @xmath1 , the ising critical temperature . in that case , the type of correlation is expected to be random percolation . in the limit of percolating bonds with an infinite range ,",
    "the percolation temperature moves to @xmath10 and there is crossover to classical critical behavior@xcite . in three dimensions",
    "this effect of a shift in the percolation threshold occurs already with ising clusters ( nn - clusters ) : the percolation threshold lies at a temperature a few percent below @xmath1@xcite , whereas the coniglio - klein clusters have their percolation threshold at @xmath1 . in two dimensions it is known , as stated above , that for nn - clusters @xmath0 coincides with @xmath1 but it was believed@xcite that already for nnn - clusters @xmath11 .",
    "however , in this paper we shall show that @xmath12 for nnn - clusters .",
    "these alternative cluster definitions can be useful in some applications of correlated percolation . in another paper@xcite ,",
    "we present a model , based on correlated percolation , to explain the experimental results for colossal magnetoresistance .",
    "the latter phenomenon is presently a hot topic in solid state physics@xcite .",
    "our model is a correlated resistor network , obtained by replacing bonds with resistances yielding an effective resistance as an ising expectation value . in the present work , we present the technical analysis of the correlated percolation model with percolating bonds having a longer range of interaction .",
    "in particular , the resulting phase diagram is vital for understanding the experimental results of colossal magnetoresistance .",
    "the correlated resistor network has , to our knowledge , never been studied in the literature .",
    "we performed monte carlo calculations to measure the critical exponents of the crn .",
    "also these calculations are presented in this paper .",
    "we will be concerned with the usual ising model on a square lattice with hamiltonian @xmath13 where @xmath5 is the inverse temperature and @xmath14 is the magnetic field .",
    "the first summation is over nearest neighbors only .",
    "note that we are going to define percolating bonds that have a longer range than nearest neighbors only ; the ising hamiltonian however , interacts only via nearest neighbors .",
    "first consider the nn - clusters by putting bonds between all neighboring pairs of up spins , such as the clusters made of the black spins in figure  [ clusterconf ] . in the same figure ,",
    "also the nnn - clusters are illustrated but now for the white spins . here",
    "bonds are put between next - nearest neighboring pairs of white spins as well .",
    "the percolation phase diagram for the nn - clusters is known@xcite and shown in figure  [ phasediag - nn ] .",
    "the thick solid line is a critical percolation transition ; the end point at @xmath15 corresponds to random percolation and lies at the value of @xmath14 corresponding to the percolation threshold@xcite @xmath16 for random percolation .",
    "this value denotes the density of up spins .",
    "the corresponding value of @xmath14 is @xmath17 .",
    "the critical percolation line is in the universality class of random percolation , described by the critical @xmath18 state potts model .",
    "the line merges smoothly with the @xmath19-axis at the ising critical point . for percolation",
    ", this point turns out@xcite to be a tricritical point ; it is the tricritical point of the @xmath18 state dilute potts model , where , apart from the usual potts spins , also vacancies are allowed .    from this",
    "phase diagram the corresponding diagram for nnn - clusters can be derived .",
    "figure  [ clusterconf ] illustrates the theorem@xcite that will be needed for this derivation .",
    "it can easily be seen from this figure that there exists a geometrical relation between the black nn - clusters and the white nnn - clusters .",
    "the theorem states that _ every face of a black nn - cluster is either empty or is wholly occupied by one and only one white nnn - cluster . _",
    "a face is a closed area surrounded by elementary loops consisting of the bonds of one cluster .",
    "let us introduce the following notation : let @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 be the number of faces , clusters , bonds and sites respectively that correspond to the black spins and nn - clusters in a certain spin configuration .",
    "for the white spins and nnn - clusters , these quantities are @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 respectively , where the star denotes the fact that it concerns nnn - clusters .",
    "the theorem then states that @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the number of empty black faces .",
    "the number of faces , bonds , sites and clusters is furthermore coupled via euler s equation @xmath30 this relation is easily derived by induction and holds for non - cyclic boundary conditions , e.g. , all spins on the boundary are black .",
    "combining these two relations yields @xmath31 thus this relation expresses the number of white nnn - clusters @xmath25 in terms of the number of black nn - clusters @xmath21 .",
    "apart from the numbers of clusters it involves only locally defined quantities : bonds , sites and empty faces .",
    "the above relations are purely geometrical and hence are completely independent of the probability distribution of the black and white spins",
    ". therefore they are valid as ising expectation values as well : @xmath32 where the brackets denote the expectation values .",
    "note that the numbers of bonds , sites and empty black faces are simply local ising operators , that is @xmath33 which amounts to counting the number of black bonds . in the same way @xmath34 counts the number of black spins and @xmath35 counts the number of empty , black faces , where @xmath36 denotes a summation over each elementary plaquette of the square lattice .",
    "the expectation value of the number of clusters plays the role of the free energy in a percolation problem@xcite .",
    "it becomes non - analytic at a percolation transition . from equation  ( [ zwartwit ] ) we see that @xmath25 can only become critical when @xmath21 is critical , that is , when the black spins are at their percolation threshold , or when the ising expectation values become non - analytic , that is , at the ising critical point and at the coexistence line @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "this immediately yields the phase diagram for percolation of the black nnn - clusters : it is the mirror image of that of the nn - clusters with @xmath14 replaced by @xmath39 .",
    "this phase diagram is shown in figure  [ phasediag - nnn ] .",
    "it is somewhat surprising that extending the range of percolating bonds to next - nearest neighbors does not alter the percolation threshold at the @xmath19-axis .",
    "it was expected@xcite that for larger ranges than nearest neighbor percolating bonds the percolation temperature @xmath0 would become less than @xmath1 .",
    "due to the above geometrical relations this is not the case . for",
    "even larger percolation ranges , however , there are no such relations and we expect the percolation temperature @xmath0 to drop below the ising critical temperature @xmath1 .",
    "the topology of the phase diagram then changes .",
    "there is no tricritical point anymore , and the critical percolation line will end somewhere at the @xmath19-axis below @xmath1 . beyond this point , there still is a first order transition for percolation .",
    "we expect the percolation point @xmath0 in that case to be a critical endpoint .",
    "such a point is expected@xcite to have in addition to the critical exponents of the universality class of the critical line also a first order exponent @xmath40 . indeed , when the range of percolating bonds becomes very large , it will eventually become larger than the ising correlation length .",
    "in such a case , correlations in the probability distribution of empty and occupied sites are only present on a much smaller scale than the range of percolating bonds .",
    "this strongly suggests that the universality class of the endpoint of the critical line is that of random percolation .",
    "eventually , when the percolation range approaches infinity , percolation is believed to exhibit classical critical behavior@xcite .",
    "from universality , we expect both types of critical behavior , nn - percolation and nnn - percolation , to be in the same universality class . in the light of equation  ( [ zwartwit ] ) , this statement is less obvious than it seems .",
    "the singular behavior of the ` free energy ' @xmath25 of nnn - clusters is expressed in @xmath21 but also in ising operators .",
    "hence in addition to the critical behavior of @xmath21 also ising exponents show up . in particular , when @xmath25 is considered as a function of the scaling field @xmath41 , in addition to the exponent @xmath42 that is expected to describe the non - analytic behavior of the free energy @xmath21 , also the magnetization exponent @xmath43 is present .",
    "nn - percolation is in the universality class of the dilute @xmath6-state potts model in the limit of @xmath7 .",
    "its hamiltonian@xcite is @xmath44 the variables @xmath45 are the potts lattice gas variables .",
    "potts spins @xmath46 are present on the sites where @xmath47 .    for @xmath18",
    "the hamiltonian becomes equal to the ising hamiltonian and completely independent of @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "substituting @xmath50 turns the lattice gas variables into ising variables .",
    "the hamiltonian then becomes , apart from a constant , @xmath51 with @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "this means that the free energy resulting from equation  ( [ potts ] ) for @xmath18 is equal to that of the ising model .",
    "the full free energy is @xmath54 where @xmath55 denotes the number of sites on the lattice .",
    "the generating function@xcite for percolation is @xmath56 this quantity @xmath57 is , with @xmath58 , the expectation value of the number of clusters .",
    "it plays the role of the free energy in percolation problems .",
    "the limit @xmath59 corresponds to nn - clusters , and @xmath60 yields the coniglio - klein clusters .    in the language of the renormalization group , the tricritical point in the @xmath18",
    "dilute potts model has four relevant exponents and corresponding scaling fields , two thermal and two magnetic ones . expressing the free energy in terms of these scalings fields @xmath61",
    ", the scaling relation is @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the renormalization length , and the tricritical point is located at @xmath64 .",
    "note that the ` field ' @xmath6 , which is a symmetry parameter , can not change under renormalization .",
    "differentiating this free energy with respect to @xmath6 yields the percolation free energy . applying this to the above scaling relation yields , apart from the direct derivative to @xmath6 , also derivatives with respect to the thermal scaling fields @xmath41 and @xmath65 which are @xmath66 when @xmath67 .",
    "the location of the tricritical point thus depends on the value of @xmath6 .",
    "the remaining two fields @xmath68 and @xmath69 are magnetic scaling fields ; they correspond to potts - like magnetic fields",
    ". the potts - model can only be critical if those fields are zero , regardless of the value of @xmath6 , which means that the derivative of these fields with respect to @xmath6 yields zero .    from these remarks",
    "it follows that in the expression for @xmath57 several derivatives are present : a direct derivative with respect to @xmath6 and derivatives with respect to the thermal scaling fields : @xmath70 applying equation  ( [ scaling ] ) to this expression and taking the limit of @xmath7 yields the critical behavior of @xmath57 .",
    "note that the two last terms of the right hand side of ( [ deriv ] ) are with @xmath18 just derivatives of the ising free energy : they give the ising energy and magnetization , and thus yield ising critical behavior .",
    "the values of the exponents @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the ising values @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "this gives for the singular behavior of @xmath57 as a function of the thermal fields @xmath41 @xmath75 the most relevant of these exponents is @xmath76 , the exponent of the ising order parameter .",
    "the singular behavior of @xmath57 thus is described by an exponent @xmath43 , contrary to what is expected for the behavior of a free energy - like quantity : the value of @xmath73 suggests a critical exponent @xmath77 for the percolation free energy @xmath57 .",
    "this exponent indeed occurs in the expression for @xmath57 but is dominated by the exponent @xmath43 .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath57 is not a true free energy but a derivative of a free energy with respect to a symmetry parameter .",
    "the order parameter @xmath78 ( the density of sites in the infinite cluster ) and the ` susceptibility ' ( the mean cluster size ) arise from differentiating @xmath57 with respect to @xmath49 .",
    "the free energy @xmath79 itself becomes completely independent of @xmath49 in the limit for @xmath7 , which means that only the derivatives of @xmath80 with respect to @xmath49 yield a non - zero result .",
    "the other terms in equation  ( [ deriv ] ) vanish upon taking the derivative .",
    "this means that the critical behavior of the order parameter and the susceptibility is not affected by the ` wrong ' critical behavior of @xmath57 .    from the scaling results ( [ scalingresult ] ) of @xmath57 we can derive the critical behavior of the nnn - clusters using equation  ( [ zwartwit ] ) .",
    "the dominating exponent in the right hand side of ( [ zwartwit ] ) is again @xmath43 , which appears in @xmath57 but also in the ising magnetization @xmath81 .",
    "this shows that the critical behavior of @xmath57 and @xmath82 , that is , of nn - clusters and nnn - clusters , is governed by the same exponents .",
    "the same must be true for the order parameter @xmath78 and the susceptibility of nnn - percolation .",
    "again these quantities arise from differentiating the free energy @xmath82 with respect to the potts field @xmath49 .",
    "although @xmath82 is different from @xmath57 in its dependence on @xmath49 , both amount to a dilute @xmath18 states potts model . with the identification of the critical behavior of @xmath57 and @xmath82 it follows that at @xmath1 both free energies must be at a tricritical point in the full phase diagram of this model .",
    "we conclude that percolation of nn - clusters and of nnn - clusters is in the same universality class .",
    "the critical behavior of the percolation quantities is governed by the same set of critical exponents .",
    "relevant for our work on colossal magnetoresistance@xcite is the behavior of the ising model as a resistor network .",
    "a percolation model is turned into a resistor network@xcite by replacing the bonds with resistors .",
    "non - percolating bonds are left empty ( that is , have infinite resistance ) , bonds that are present get a unit resistance .",
    "this can be done both for nn - clusters and nnn - clusters .",
    "the assignment of resistors is depicted in figure  [ resistors ] .    for random percolation",
    "the resistor network is a random resistor network .",
    "the corresponding correlated resistor network has as far as we know never been studied . in this section",
    "we present our calculations on the correlated resistor network .",
    "the interest in resistor network problems is in the expectation value of the overall resistance of the ( infinite ) lattice . to be more precise :",
    "consider a lattice consisting of @xmath83 spins , where @xmath84 eventually is sent to infinity , and keep the lower row at a fixed potential @xmath85 and the upper row at @xmath86 .",
    "the interest is in the overall conductance @xmath87 of the lattice , which is in this case equal to the expectation value of the current .",
    "the phase diagram of the resistor network is of course the same as that of its percolation counterpart : when there is percolation , the conductance is finite , and the conductance is zero when there is no percolation .",
    "experimental results for colossal magnetoresistance show a sharp increase in the resistance as a function of temperature at or nearby the curie point @xmath1 .",
    "the resistance drops sharply both above and below this point . from our phase",
    "diagrams it is directly clear that the diagram of figure  [ phasediag - nn ] is ruled out .",
    "so conduction via next - nearest neighbor bonds should at least be present to produce the right phase diagram .",
    "turning , however , to critical exponents the situation is different . in this case",
    "it is the exponent @xmath2 governing the vanishing conductance @xmath87 upon approaching the percolation threshold : @xmath88 based on universality ( again confirmed for the percolation exponents ) one may well assume that the exponent @xmath2 is the same for nn- and nnn - networks .",
    "hence we studied the ( simpler ) case of the resistor network with only nn - clusters .",
    "the random resistor network is a notoriously unsolved problem in statistical physics , but there are good numerical estimates of the exponent @xmath2 .",
    "the best estimate@xcite in two dimensions known to us is @xmath89 . to obtain the value of @xmath2 for the correlated resistor network in the ising case , at the tricritical percolation point , we performed monte carlo calculations at the ising critical point , and calculated the ising expectation value of the conductance for different system sizes .",
    "we used the wolff - algorithm@xcite for the monte carlo part , and the multigrid method of edwards , goodman and sokal@xcite , based on the standard code amg1r4@xcite , to calculate the conductance of a spin configuration .    to test our program",
    ", we calculated the exactly known@xcite exponent of the order parameter .",
    "the order parameter of percolation is the density of sites @xmath78 in the infinite cluster . from finite size",
    "scaling , it follows that this quantity scales with the linear system size @xmath84 as @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the most relevant magnetic eigenvalue . in our monte",
    "carlo runs , we measured the number of sites in the ` spanning cluster ' , the cluster that extends over the lattice and thus allows for conductance . with the scaling equation ,",
    "the behavior of @xmath78 as a function of the system size yields an estimate of @xmath91 .",
    "we calculated @xmath78 with the system size @xmath84 running from 7 up to 350 , and the data are plotted in figure  [ density ] .",
    "the figure , a log - log plot , shows that the system sizes are too small to exhibit the behavior of equation  ( [ fss - density ] ) ; corrections to scaling have to be included .",
    "we did this , and found @xmath92 and a correction to scaling exponent @xmath93 .",
    "the exact result is @xmath94 .",
    "our estimate thus agrees well within the error bars .",
    "it is believed that a similar finite size scaling relation is valid for the conductance @xmath87 .",
    "it should scale with the linear system size @xmath84 as @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the percolation exponent of the correlation length .",
    "we calculated the conductance again with @xmath84 running from 7 up to 350 .",
    "the data are plotted in figure  [ conductance ] ; the log - log plot almost shows a straight line . in fitting the data to equation  ( [ fss ] )",
    ", we tried to include a correction to scaling term , but , due to the almost perfect scaling behavior , this did not yield sensible results",
    ". therefore we performed the fit against equation  ( [ fss ] ) without additional terms , yielding the value @xmath97 .",
    "due to the absence of the correction to scaling term the error in this result might be an underestimation of the actual error .",
    "the exponent @xmath96 of percolation at the ising critical point is @xmath98 for the direction parallel to the @xmath19-axis and @xmath99 for the other directions .",
    "that means that the exponent @xmath2 that governs the vanishing conductance at @xmath1 is @xmath100 for the temperature direction and @xmath101 for the field direction .",
    "this is a surprisingly low result , as compared to the @xmath2 value of the random resistor network , @xmath102 .",
    "the presence of critical correlations thus strongly influences the value of the conductance exponents .",
    "equation  ( [ fss ] ) relies on the validity of finite size scaling , and it is in this case not _ a priori _ clear that it is valid , since there does not exist a rigorously defined renormalization transformation for the conductance .",
    "therefore we checked the consistency of the value of the exponent by calculating the behavior of the resistance in the neighborhood of @xmath1 .",
    "the conductance then scales as @xmath103 .",
    "the value of @xmath2 obtained from this behavior was indeed seen to extrapolate to the value @xmath104 .",
    "we believe therefore that equation  ( [ fss ] ) must be valid .",
    "we thank alan sokal for providing us with the code for the resistance calculations , which saved us a lot of work ; bernard nienhuis for discussions on correlated percolation ; and erik luijten for discussions on the monte carlo part .",
