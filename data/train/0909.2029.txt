    "[ figure1 ] ) one can expect that vocl is intrinsically less one - dimensional from the electronic structure point of view compared to tiocl , which is in line with the observation of a two - dimensional magnetic structure as mentioned above.@xcite this is verified by calculating energy differences within gga+u among different magnetically ordered states and then mapping the results to a heisenberg model . with this method",
    "we obtain the exchange integrals between nearest neighbor interacting v ions along @xmath15 ( @xmath58 ) , along @xmath10 ( @xmath59 ) and along the diagonal direction ( @xmath60 ) ( see fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] ) .",
    "we performed the calculations for various @xmath41 values and find that @xmath58 is always larger than @xmath59 and both are antiferromagnetic ( e.g. @xmath61 at @xmath42ev and @xmath62 at @xmath63ev ) while @xmath60 is smaller than @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "however , the nature of the @xmath60 exchange depends on the choice of the @xmath41 value , e.g. , @xmath64 at @xmath42ev and @xmath65 at @xmath63ev .",
    "this is probably due to the fact that ferro- and antiferromagnetic contributions are equally important for the @xmath60 exchange and with @xmath41 increasing the antiferromagnetic contribution is suppressed , while the ferromagnetic contribution is barely affected , and @xmath60 is then ferromagnetic .",
    "nevertheless , the dominant exchanges @xmath58 and @xmath59 are always antiferromagnetic and their strengths remain comparable for various @xmath41 , indicating that vocl should be a two - dimensional antiferromagnet at low temperatures without a preferred one - dimensional hopping path induced by largely different hopping matrix elements as in tiocl . indeed , the nmto downfolding results identify the dominant hopping parameters to be of the same order of magnitude in @xmath15 ( @xmath66ev ) and @xmath10 ( @xmath67  ev ) directions and a factor @xmath68 smaller in the @xmath12 direction .",

    "also shown is the band structure calculated using gga+u .",
    "a large number of different bands and rich dispersive features which differ between the two directions are observed for the o / cl bands in very good agreement between theory and experiment .",
    "this also indicates the good quality of our single crystals . in the low - binding - energy region",
    ", gga+u shows a total of four v @xmath32 bands since there are two electrons per v site and two v sites per unit cell . in the arpes data",
    ", however , the v @xmath32 weight appears as a rather broad and weakly dispersing hump without any sharp features , as can be seen in the blow - up shown in fig .",
    "[ figure6 ] .",
    "this behavior was reproducibly observed on many different samples and is not due to , e.g. , a limited experimental resolution .",
    "it is rather an intrinsic property which for several reasons can not be expected to be fully captured in our calculations . from a strict many - body view",
    "the v @xmath32 bands do not have quasi - particle character , but must be interpreted as incoherent weight in the spirit of a mott - hubbard scenario .",
    "thus , a description of the detailed line shapes within gga+u , being an effective single - particle approach which does not account for dynamical and spatial fluctuations , is admittedly intricate .",
    "this issue has been extensively studied for the case of tiocl , where dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) with a quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) impurity solver@xcite in order to take full account of dynamical correlations , as well as the extension to cluster- rather than single - site calculations,@xcite have led to considerable improvement . of course ,",
    "due to the predominant one - dimensionality in tiocl as well as its strong tendency to form singlets ( evidenced by the unconventional spin - dimerized phases at intermediate and low temperatures@xcite ) the influence of such fluctuations is expected to be stronger than in vocl .",
    "nevertheless , this issue calls for further investigation in the present case as well .    despite these qualifying remarks",
    ", we shall give a more detailed analysis in order to compare to the computationally equally complex case of tiocl .",
    "compared to the latter , the differences of the arpes dispersions of the v 3d weight between the a and b axis are less pronounced,@xcite with the peak maximum appearing at highest binding energies at the @xmath48 point and shifting slightly to lower binding energies towards the zone boundary in both cases .",
    "a comparison shows that the trend towards lower binding energies as well as the evolution of the spectral weight distribution are qualitatively in line with the calculations : large weight is found along @xmath15 half way between @xmath48 and x , along @xmath10 right at the y point , i.e. , where bands cross in both cases .",
    "the shape of the peak , which can be seen in the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ figure6 ] , reflects these trends as well : along @xmath10 it develops from a flat hump to a more distinct , symmetric peak towards the zone boundary , while along @xmath15 the slight asymmetry towards the high - binding - energy side at @xmath48 shifts towards the low - binding - energy side at x. the overall width at the x point appears to be larger than at the y point , in line with the calculated result that the four gga+u bands merge at y while two pairs remain well separated at x. however , a detailed interpretation of this behavior needs further analysis which is beyond the scope of the present work , although we want to note that the observed asymmetric shape in vocl is reminiscent of tiocl where the asymmetry has been attributed to correlations.@xcite    overall , the agreement between gga+u and arpes for vocl is better than in the case of tiocl .",
    "this is probably due to the fact that the influence of dynamical and/or spatial fluctuation effects in vocl is smaller than in tiocl .",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated the electronic structure of the low - dimensional @xmath70 system vocl using photoemission spectroscopy and gga+u band structure calculations . from a comparison to gga calculations",
    "we could show that its insulating nature is due to strong correlations of the v @xmath32 valence electrons instead of band structure effects , which is the first conclusive evidence for the mott character of the insulating state .",
    "the issue of choosing @xmath38 has been addressed concerning the correct description of the hybridization pattern in favor of a reasonable magnitude for the charge gap .",
    "calculation of the exchange integrals shows that vocl is two - dimensional both electronically and magnetically , and the obtained antiferromagnetic exchange within the @xmath11 plane is robust upon variation of @xmath41 and in line with experimental observations .",
    "calculated band dispersions agree well with the ones observed via angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy for the high - binding - energy uncorrelated bands , and qualitatively match the v @xmath32 derived weight .",
    "no considerable in - plane anisotropy within the vo bilayers is observed in arpes , supporting the two - dimensional nature of the system .",
    "overall , we could show that vocl is a quasi - two - dimensional ( as opposed to quasi - one - dimensional ) system and can be well described as a two - band mott - hubbard insulator with @xmath1 ground state configuration ."
