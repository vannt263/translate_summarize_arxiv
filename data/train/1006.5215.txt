    "most rationally would have a natural value of order of the planck scale .",
    "in fact , most of the phenomenological studies of the noncommutativity models expect that the noncommutative energy scale can not lie far above the tev scale @xcite .",
    "since the fundamental planck scale in models with large extra dimensions becomes as small as a tev in order to solve the hierarchy problem @xcite , therefore , depending on the models , it is feasible to set the noncommutativity effects in a @xmath5 tev regime , etc . @xcite .",
    "a radiation spectrum of an evaporating black hole , which is closely comparable to the blackbody radiation spectrum , can be illustrated by a characteristic temperature known as the hawking temperature @xcite . hawking s method",
    "unfortunately yields a nonunitarity of quantum theory , which maps a pure state to a mixed state , due to the purely thermal essence of the spectrum . in 2000 ,",

    "the tunneling procedure illuminates the fact that the modified radiation spectrum is not accurately thermal and this yields the unitarity of underlying quantum theory @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we would like to suggest a new formulation of noncommutativity of coordinates for a vaidya black hole which is performed by a gaussian distribution of coherent states .",
    "this type of black hole is considered as an illustration of a more practical case because it is a time - dependent lessening mass caused by the evaporation process .",

    "as mentioned briefly in the introduction , the simple idea of a pointlike particle becomes physically irrelevant and should be replaced with a minimal width gaussian distribution of mass / energy , corresponding to the principles of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "the program we choose here is to perform an analysis which provides a solution in the case of a nonstatic , spherically symmetric , asymptotically flat , minimal width , gaussian distribution of mass / energy whose noncommutative size is characterized by the parameter @xmath4 . for this purpose , the mass / energy distribution should be displayed by a smeared delta function @xmath6 where , in this approach , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are functions of both time and radius .",
    "the dynamics for the black hole mass with evaporation is a persistent problem . in the study of black hole evaporation",
    ", there is a significant point in which the black hole mass reduces as a backreaction of the hawking radiation .",
    "since a nonstatic and spherically symmetric spacetime depends on an arbitrary dynamical mass function , it can be properly demonstrated by a vaidya solution @xcite that seems to be the favored option . in this work ,",
    "due to deriving an exact @xmath9 dependent case of the metric , we study the schwarzschild - like metric for the vaidya solution instead of a standard eddington - finkelstein metric .    in this paper",
    "we want to generalize the vaidya metric derived by farley and death @xcite to the noncommutative model of ccs .",
    "the general spherically symmetric vaidya spacetime in @xmath10 coordinates , ( @xmath11 ) , in the presence of @xmath9 dependent mass sources can be written as @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 , and @xmath14 . here @xmath15 is the arbitrary positive function of @xmath16 and @xmath17 . in the following ,",
    "due to the mathematical intricacy of einstein field equations and in order to make the problem obedient , we frequently impose the particular cases , e.g. @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) , the overdot abbreviates @xmath20 .",
    "this metric looks like the schwarzschild spacetime , except that the role of the schwarzschild mass is taken by a mass function @xmath21 , which changes exceedingly gradually concerning both @xmath16 and @xmath17 in the spacetime region containing the outgoing radiation @xcite . the corresponding geometry in this region including the radially outgoing radiation is , therefore , the slowly varying vaidya type .    in order to determine the mass function , we consider the covariant conservation condition @xmath22 , which yields the explicit result @xmath23 the schwarzschild - like condition @xmath24 will require that @xmath25 , and then the above relation leads to a solution for @xmath26 which reads . ] @xmath27 where the prime abbreviates @xmath28 .",

    ", we consider the situation of nonstatic in which the analytic mass solution is time dependent , @xmath8 .",

    "( [ mat:12 ] ) satisfies eq .",
    "( [ mat:7 ] ) with a good approximation .",
    "depending on the different values of initial mass @xmath50 , and upon a numerical solution , the metric displays three possible causal structures : ( 1 ) it is possible to have two distinct horizons when the initial mass of the black hole is larger than minimal nonzero mass @xmath51 , i.e. @xmath52 ( see fig .  [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "( 2 ) it is possible to have one degenerate horizon ( extremal black hole ) , for @xmath53 ( see fig .  [ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "( 3 ) it is impossible to have a horizon at all ( for @xmath54 ) , and this possibility is shown in fig .  [ fig:3 ] .    as fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] shows , for a sufficiently large and fixed @xmath55 , e.g. @xmath56 , the distance between the horizons will increase as time progresses .",
    "the appearance of a naked singularity at @xmath57 in a nonstatic case is natural which has not been supported by the cosmic censorship conjecture @xcite .",
    "one of the main arguments in support of the censorship conjecture is the stability of black holes concerning small perturbations .",
    "indeed there are various effects that point out that at least in its simplest form the censorship conjecture is dubious .",
    "let us consider the possible blueshift unstableness at the inner horizon as an example which demonstrates the feasible formation of naked singularities in conditions which might be considered as physically sensible .",
    "since an observer passing through the inner horizon would encounter an infinite blueshift of any entering emission , as he comes near the horizon , he surveys the total history of the outward region in a determinate interval of his individual proper time .",
    "so it would be possible for any small perturbation to upset the horizon and emerge as a naked singularity . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was illustrated that the inner ( cauchy ) horizon of some of the black holes ( e.g. reissner - nordstrm black holes ) is unsteady and their solutions are unsuccessful to be globally hyperbolic .",
    "if a spacetime fails to be globally hyperbolic , the weak censorship conjecture is destroyed @xcite .",
    "then it must include a naked singularity , i.e. , there exists a future directed causal curve that arrives a distant observer , and in the past it ends at the singularity .",
    "on the other hand when @xmath17 is immoderately small , in the region where noncommutativity effects accurately commence to be perceived , the detailed nature of the sharpened mass distribution is not practically being scrutinized .",
    "recently @xcite , we have reported some results about extraordinary thermodynamical behavior for planck - scale black hole evaporation , i.e. , when @xmath50 is less than @xmath51 , where there is the principal reactiveness to noncommutativity effects and the detailed form of the matter distribution . in this area , some unusual thermodynamical features , e.g. , negative entropy , negative temperature , and abnormal heat capacity appeared .",
    "there are also the predominant differences between the gaussian , lorentzian , or some other forms of the smeared mass distribution at this extreme regime . in other words ,",
    "the bases of these theories probably become as a result of the fractal nature of spacetime at very short distances .",
    "theories such as @xmath58 infinity @xcite and scale relativity @xcite which are on the basis of the fractal structure of spacetime at very short distances may provide a suitable framework to handle thermodynamics of these very short distance systems .",
    "therefore , we really should not have credence to the details of our modeling when @xmath59 and only apply the gaussian - smeared mass distribution in our calculations just on the condition that @xmath60 .    the plot presented in fig",
    ".  [ fig:2 ] shows , for several values of minimal nonzero mass @xmath51 , the possibility of having an extremal configuration with one degenerate event horizon as time progresses . for more details ,",
    "the numerical results for the remnant size of the black hole for different values of @xmath61 are presented in table  [ tab:1 ] . according to table  [ tab:1 ] , as time moves forward the minimal nonzero mass decreases but the minimal nonzero horizon radius increases which means that in the limit @xmath48 , the micro black hole can evaporate completely , i.e. @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , the idea of a stable black hole remnant as a candidate to conserve information has failed .",
    "note that , currently there are some proposals about what happens to the information that falls into a black hole .",
    "one of the main proposals is that the black hole never disappears completely , and the information is not lost , but would be stored in a planck size stable remnant ( for reviews on resolving the so - called information loss problem , see @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , when one considers the time - varying mass , based on our model and preferred calculations , total evaporation of the black hole is possible in principle .",
    "this is in agreement with the original bekenstein - hawking approach @xcite and also our approach by using the time - varying speed of light model @xcite .",
    "+     time & minimal nonzero mass & minimal nonzero horizon radius + @xmath63 & @xmath64 & @xmath65 + @xmath66 & @xmath67 & @xmath68 + @xmath69 & @xmath70 & @xmath71 + @xmath72 & @xmath73 & @xmath74 + @xmath75 & @xmath76 & @xmath77 + @xmath78 & @xmath79 & @xmath80 + @xmath81 & @xmath82 & @xmath83 + @xmath84 & @xmath85 & @xmath86 + @xmath87 & @xmath88 & @xmath89 +    [ tab:1 ]    for a sufficiently small and fixed @xmath55 , e.g. @xmath90 , there is no event horizon when the initial mass of the black hole is smaller than the minimal nonzero mass which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] .",

    ", the gauss error function tends to 1 and the other term will exponentially be reduced to zero .",
    "thus one retrieves the conventional result @xmath96 therefore , the modified vaidya solution is reduced to the ordinary schwarzschild solution .",
    "it is clear that the line element ( [ mat:11 ] ) has a coordinate singularity at the event horizon as @xmath97 the analytical solution of eq .",
    "( [ mat:17 ] ) for @xmath98 in a closed form is impossible , but it is possible to solve ( [ mat:17 ] ) to find @xmath50 , which provides the initial mass as a function of the horizon radius @xmath98 .",
    "this leads to @xmath99^{-1}.\\ ] ] the results of the numerical solution of the initial mass as a function of the horizon radius are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] which are comparable to table  [ tab:1 ] .    as expected , from the initial mass equation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] ) , one acquires that noncommutativity indicates a minimal nonzero mass in order to have an event horizon .",
    "so , in the noncommutative case , for @xmath100 there is no event horizon ( see fig .  [ fig:2 ] and also table  [ tab:1 ] ) .",
    "the radiating behavior associated with this noncommutative black hole solution can now be investigated by the quantum tunneling process suggested by parikh and wilczek @xcite . to portray the quantum tunneling method where a particle moves in dynamical geometry and passes through the horizon without singularity on the path",
    ", we should utilize a coordinate system that is not singular at the horizon .",
    "painlev coordinates @xcite which are used to eliminate coordinate singularity are especially convenient choices in this analysis . under the painlev time",
    "coordinate transformation , @xmath101 the noncommutative painlev metric now takes the following form : @xmath102 @xmath103 the metric is now stationary , and there is no coordinate singularity at the horizon . the outgoing motion of the massless particles ( the outgoing radial null geodesics , @xmath104 ) takes the form @xmath105 since we just need an approximation value of @xmath47 for short distances in the vicinity of the horizon , we can expand the coefficient @xmath47 by using the taylor series at a fixed time and just to first order .",
    "so , we have @xmath106 by this approximation at the neighborhood of the black hole horizon , the equation of radial null geodesic can be obtained by @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the surface gravity for the metric ( [ mat:20 ] ) at the horizon .",
    "now we are ready to consider the hawking temperature of such a black hole ( see @xcite for a more detailed discussion of the semiclassical methods to derive the hawking temperature in the vaidya black hole ) . from the expression @xmath109 , the noncommutative hawking temperature including the time - dependent part is given by @xmath110.\\ ] ] for the time - independent case , @xmath63 , one retrieves the hawking temperature for the noncommutative schwarzschild black hole that is consistent with the ref .",
    "@xcite . in the limit of @xmath1",
    "going to zero , we get the classical hawking temperature , @xmath111 .",
    "the numerical computation of the noncommutative hawking temperature as a function of horizon radius ( the outer horizon radius ) is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] the black hole at the ultimate phase of evaporation ceases to radiate , its temperature reaches zero and the existence of a minimal nonzero mass is clear . in this modified version",
    ", there is no divergence at the final stage of the black hole evaporation because the temperature reaches a maximum definite value before cooling down to absolute zero , at the minimal nonzero value of the outer horizon radius @xmath112 , that the black hole shrinks to ( see table  [ tab:1 ] ) .",
    "let us come back to the tunneling procedure . in accordance with the original work proposed by parikh and wilczek @xcite ,",
    "the wkb approximation is valid at the neighborhood of the horizon .",
    "then , the emission rate for the classically forbidden region as a function of the imaginary part of the action for a particle in a tunneling process is given by ) .",
    "there is a problem here known as the `` factor @xmath113 problem '' @xcite .",
    "recently , some authors ( see @xcite and references therein ) have declared that the relation ( [ mat:25 ] ) is not invariant under canonical transformations but the same formula with a factor of @xmath114 in the exponent is canonically invariant .",
    "this method leads to a temperature which is higher than the hawking temperature by a factor of @xmath113 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a resolution to this problem was given in terms of an overlooked temporal contribution to the tunneling amplitude .",
    "when one includes this temporal contribution one gets exactly the correct temperature and exactly when one uses the canonically invariant tunneling amplitude . ]",
    "@xmath115 now , we consider a spherical positive energy shell containing the components of massless particles each of which journeys on a radial null geodesic like an @xmath116-wave outgoing particle which crosses the horizon in the outward direction from @xmath117 to @xmath118 .",
    "hence , the imaginary part of the action takes the following form @xmath119 utilizing hamilton s equation of motion @xmath120 , the integral variable is changed from momentum to energy .",
    "so , we have @xmath121 if we consider the particle s self - gravitation effect , according to the original work by kraus and wilczek @xcite , then eq .  ( [ mat:23 ] ) should be modified .",
    "we retain the total arnowitt - deser - misner mass ( @xmath50 ) of the spacetime fixed , and allow the hole mass to fluctuate because we take into consideration the response of the background geometry which corresponds to an emitted quantum of energy @xmath58 at a fixed time or a stationary phase .",
    "therefore we should replace @xmath50 by @xmath122 in eq .",
    "( [ mat:23 ] ) and then ( [ mat:27 ] ) .",
    "the imaginary action ( [ mat:27 ] ) now becomes @xmath123 the @xmath17 integral can be performed first by a contour integration for the lower half @xmath124 plane due to the escape from the pole at the horizon . in this way , we acquire @xmath125 on the condition that @xmath126 . using the first low of black hole thermodynamics , @xmath127 , the expression @xmath128 given by @xcite @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the noncommutative black hole entropy .",
    "the tunneling amplitude in the high energy depends on the final and initial number of microstates available for the system ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "thus , we have @xmath131 from this viewpoint the emission rate is proportional to the difference in black hole entropies before and after emission which means that the emission spectrum can not be accurately thermal at higher energies .    we should note that the tunneling amplitude can also be obtained by writing out the explicit metric in the tunneling calculation . to find the analytic form of the difference in black hole entropies before and after emission and then compute the expression @xmath132 , we evaluate the integral ( [ mat:27 ] ) by writing the explicit form for the radial null geodesic , eq .",

    "we should stress that the total of our results in ref .",
    "@xcite are recovered by setting @xmath63 into the above corresponding equations .",
    "the question which arises here is the possible dependences between different modes of radiation during the evaporation and then the time evolution of these possible correlations which needs further investigation and probably sheds more light on the information loss problem @xcite .",
    "this problem is currently under investigation .",
    "in summary , we have analyzed a solution of the einstein equations with a noncommutative distribution of mass / energy which is spherically symmetric , time - dependent and localized near the origin of the spacetime , namely , the noncommutative - inspired vaidya solution . in this setup , the proposal of stable black hole remnant as a candidate to store information has failed because the black hole evaporates completely in the long time limit .",
    "finally , by using the semiclassical method , we have derived the hawking temperature and the emission rate via a tunneling process which includes the corrections due to noncommutativity .",
    "the entropy for such a black hole is approximately computed in a closed form .",
    "these corrections would be significant at the level of semiclassical quantum gravity , specifically once the black hole mass becomes close to the planck mass .",
