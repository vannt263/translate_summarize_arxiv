    "the holstein model , as a paradigm for polaron formation , has attracted renewed interest in recent years because several lines of experimental evidence support the presence of polaron carriers in strongly correlated electronic materials , including colossal magnetoresistance manganites @xcite , organics @xcite , quasi-1d systems , and high-@xmath2 cuprates @xcite .",
    "theoretical research on polaron physics began six decades ago , and the problem remains unsolved due to its intrinsic many - body complexity from the electron - phonon interaction .",
    "( the problem of excitons coupled to phonons is formally equivalent @xcite . )",
    "standard perturbation treatments @xcite are usually limited to a particular parameter regime . with constantly growing computational resources ,",
    "various numerical techniques have been applied to polaron problems in recent years , which give the most reliable results in the physically interesting crossover regime .",
    "these techniques include finite - cluster exact diagonalization ( ed)@xcite , quantum monte carlo ( qmc)@xcite , density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg)@xcite , and the global - local variational method ( glvm)@xcite .",
    "recent numerical studies have focused on the 1d lattice model . due to the enormous phonon hilbert space in three dimensions , the dimensionality effects on the polaron problems",
    "are less studied except in the adiabatic ( or semiclassical ) approximations@xcite , and in perturbation theory@xcite .",
    "qmc is also capable of computing the energy and effective mass of the 3d polaron , but the full dispersion @xmath3 is only reliable in the strong - coupling regime .",
    "however , with a recently developed variational method , we can compute the polaron effective mass , band dispersion , and el - ph correlation functions of the ground and low - lying excited states in all coupling regimes , preserving the full quantum dynamical feature of phonons ( details can be found in ref .",
    "the variational space is defined on an infinite lattice , although only a finite separation is allowed between the electron and the surrounding phonons in current implementations .",
    "we systematically expand the variational space so that highly accurate results can be achieved with modest computational resources .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to characterize the holstein polaron in higher dimensions .",
    "we consider a single - electron holstein hamiltonian on a d - dimensional hypercubic lattice , @xmath4 where @xmath5 creates an electron and @xmath6 creates a phonon on site @xmath7 .",
    "the parameters of the model are the nearest - neighbor hopping integral @xmath8 , the el - ph coupling strength @xmath9 , and the phonon frequency @xmath10 .",
    "the electron is coupled locally to a dispersionless optical phonon mode @xcite .",
    "there are two commonly defined dimensionless control parameters , the adiabaticity ratio @xmath11 , and the el - ph coupling strength @xmath12 , which is defined as the ratio of polaron energy for an electron confined to a single site @xmath13 , and the free electron half bandwidth @xmath14 .",
    "the strong ( weak ) coupling regime refers to @xmath15 , and the adiabatic ( antiadiabatic ) regime refers to @xmath16 .",
    "an additional dimensionless parameter is @xmath17 , which appears in strong - coupling perturbation theory .",
    "a variational space is constructed beginning with a root state , the electron at the origin with no phonon excitations , and acting repeatedly with the off - diagonal terms ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) in the hamiltonian , eq .  [ eq : ham ] .",
    "states in generation @xmath18 are those that can be created by acting @xmath18 times with off - diagonal terms .",
    "all translations of these states on an infinite lattice are included , and the problem is diagonalized for a given momentum @xmath19 using a lanczos method @xcite . a small variational space , with 7 states per electron site ( unit cell ) ,",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tight ] .",
    "( the more accurate numerical computations are done with over @xmath20 states per unit cell . )",
    "the total number of states @xmath21 per unit cell after @xmath18 generations increases exponentially , as @xmath22 , where @xmath0 is the spatial dimension .",
    "( the bipolaron has the same @xmath22 dependence , but with a larger prefactor . )",
    "the perhaps surprising fact is that while the size of the hilbert space grows exponentially with @xmath18 , the error in the ground state energy decreases exponentially , because states are added in a fairly efficient order .",
    "figure [ fig : convg ] shows the fractional error in the ground state energy as a function of the number of basis states in hilbert space .",
    "the accuracy is determined by comparing the energy as the size of the hilbert space is increased . at intermediate coupling in any dimension , the energy improves by about a factor of 8 with each generation @xcite . in 1d , each added generation approximately doubles the size of the hilbert space , whereas in 4d , the size increases five - fold .",
    "this rapid convergence at intermediate - coupling is valuable since no analytic approach is reliable in this regime .",
    "table i lists the energies for 1d to 4d polarons at intermediate- to weak - coupling .",
    "the accuracy , 21 digits for 1d polaron , is high compared to that of other numerical methods , such as 2 or 3 digits for qmc , 6 digits for dmrg ( or glvm ) , and up to 8 digits for ed @xcite .",
    "moreover , for the 3d polaron at intermediate- to strong - coupling , an energy accuracy of 8 - 10 decimal places can be achieved in the nonadiabatic regime with fewer than @xmath23 basis states . to obtain an accuracy beyond 13 digits , the code is executed in quadruple precision .",
    "the present variational method requires only power - law time to achieve a given accuracy ( in any dimension ) , which is a qualitative improvement on exact diagonalization as it is currently implemented , the latter requiring exponential time .    in this paper",
    "we present detailed studies of the dimensionality effect on the holstein polaron .",
    "first of all , we explore the polaron characteristics in the @xmath24 ground state , and compare our results with previous studies from qmc , dmrg , and dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) .",
    "secondly , we compute the el - ph correlation function and the polaron energy @xmath25 .",
    "finally , the validity of the toyozawa variational method is investigated by calculating the ground - state energy , and the 2-point and 3-point el - ph correlation functions .",
    "the small polaron crossover or `` self - trapping transition '' has been one of the core issues in polaron problems .",
    "adiabatic theory suggests that the polaron in 2d and 3d ( but not in 1d ) , is in an `` extended '' state with an infinite radius below an el - ph coupling threshold @xmath28 , and beyond which is a `` localized '' state with infinite effective mass .",
    "( this phenomenon is usually termed the `` self - trapping transition '' . )",
    "however , our studies confirm that in all dimensions , there is a crossover rather than a self - trapping transition ( ground state properties are analytic ) , if the parameters are finite .",
    "this result is consistent with some other recent studies @xcite and corroborates the theorem of gerlach and lwen @xcite .",
    "the quasiparticle weight ( renormalization factor ) is defined by the overlap ( squared ) between the bare electron and a polaron , i.e. , @xmath29 in which @xmath30 is the ground state wavefunction of a polaron and @xmath31 is the vacuum state .",
    "@xmath26 can be measured in photoemission or tunneling experiments .",
    "figure [ fig : crossover ] shows the crossover of @xmath32 as a function of @xmath33 at @xmath34 , for 1d to 4d cases .",
    "we see that _ the crossover to large effective mass of the higher - dimensional polaron is much sharper than the @xmath35 polaron_. for @xmath36 , a fairly abrupt crossover occurs at @xmath37 , whereas the crossover for the 1d polaron spans a wide range of @xmath38 . with a smaller @xmath39 ( but greater than @xmath40 ) , the crossover will be slower but with the same dimensional characteristics .",
    "in the limit @xmath41 , the phonon wavefunction contracts to the electron site , with @xmath42 . the inset shows a comparison of @xmath26 and @xmath43 for the 1d polaron .",
    "their fractional difference @xmath44 , defined as @xmath45 , is shown as a dotted line .",
    "the maximum @xmath44 is @xmath46 , in the intermediate coupling regime , while the minimum occurs as @xmath41 ( small @xmath8 ) , where @xmath44 is the order of @xmath47 from strong - coupling perturbation theory ( scpt ) .",
    "we find that @xmath44 decreases significantly as the dimension increases .",
    "the maximum difference @xmath48 is @xmath49 for the 2d , and @xmath50 for the 3d polaron . for @xmath51 , @xmath48 in 3d",
    "drops to @xmath52 .",
    "the ground state energy @xmath53 satisfies @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the self - energy .",
    "@xmath56 is the probability of the wavefunction on the root site , and from first order perturbation theory @xmath57 , resulting in @xmath58 $ ] .",
    "the origin of the difference between the inverse mass and @xmath56 lies in the @xmath59-dependence of the self - energy , @xmath60 where the derivatives are evaluated at the ground state energy @xmath61 and @xmath24 . in the variational space of fig .",
    "[ fig : tight ] or in the full space , the self - energy has nonzero @xmath59-dependence because distinct unit cells are connected at branch level ( path @xmath62 ) , in addition to the trivial connection at root level . a restricted variational space , the comb basis , allows phonon excitations only on the electron site , as shown in fig .  [ fig : comb ] .",
    "in this subspace , the self - energy is k - independent , since the only path between unit cells is at the root level .",
    "the self - energy remains k - independent even in a larger space in which the tree trunks sprout lateral branches , so long as the branches do not connect to neighboring unit cells .",
    "for these cases , the @xmath63 factor and inverse mass are identical , @xmath64 . in @xmath65 scpt",
    ", @xmath44 vanishes for the same reason and @xmath66 .",
    "the effect of dimensionality on @xmath67 is made plausible by the following . in the holstein model",
    ", the dimensionality d does not directly affect the term @xmath68 in eq .  1",
    ", because the el - ph coupling is local and the phonon is dispersionless .",
    "high dimensional polarons share the same simplicity of the el - ph coupling as 1d .",
    "furthermore , we see ( in next section ) that the el - ph correlation length decreases as d increases .",
    "thus the k - dependence of the self - energy weakens in higher dimensions .",
    "the above arguments do not , however , hold for the frhlich model ( or the extended holstein model ) with longer - range el - ph coupling @xcite , where @xmath26 and @xmath43 behave quite differently .",
    "figure [ fig : dmrg ] shows our results for the effective mass as a function of @xmath38 ( at fixed @xmath69 = 1.0 ) in comparison with dmrg and qmc .",
    "our results are accurate to at least four digits , which is well below the linewidth . in all cases , fig .",
    "[ fig : dmrg](a)-(c ) , @xmath70 increases slowly when @xmath38 is small , followed by a rapid increase when @xmath37 .",
    "since it is calculated at @xmath71 ( not a small t ) , the mass behaves differently than @xmath72 that scpt suggests .",
    "note that the crossover is more rapid as d increases , which is consistent with the results in previous section . in every dimension ,",
    "our results are in quantitative agreement with qmc .",
    "the numerical error in qmc is approximately @xmath73 to @xmath74@xcite , which is good though less accurate than finite cluster ed or the present approach .",
    "dmrg is generally considered a powerful tool in dealing with many - body problems .",
    "using dmrg , jeckelmann and white have calculated holstein polaron properties in 1d and 2d .",
    "dmrg seems to be most successful calculating the ground state energy ( at @xmath24 ) and el - ph correlation functions .",
    "however , finite - size scaling is required for dmrg to compute @xmath27 @xcite , which becomes more difficult for @xmath75 . in 1d , fig.[fig : dmrg](a ) , the results from dmrg are as accurate as qmc .",
    "dmrg does not , however , calculate the mass accurately in 2d , fig .",
    "[ fig : dmrg](b ) .",
    "dynamical mean - field theory has previously been applied to the holstein polaron problem@xcite .",
    "the approach is exact in infinite dimensions but an interpolation to 3d lattices is made possible by using a semielliptical free density of states @xmath76 to mimic the low - energy features .",
    "figure [ fig : dmft ] shows a comparison of our results on a cubic lattice to dmft , which is made by setting the bandwidths equal .",
    "overall , in panel ( a ) , we see a qualitative agreement between the two calculations . dmft is accurate in the strong - coupling regime , where the surrounding phonons are predominately on the electron site .",
    "this is also the regime where strong - coupling perturbation theory works well . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dmft](b ) , we see our numerical results in agreement with weak - coupling perturbation theory in @xmath9",
    ". however , dmft fails to compute @xmath27 correctly in the weak - coupling regime .",
    "the reason is that in dmft , the lattice problem is mapped onto a self - consistent local impurity model @xcite , which preserves the interplay of the electron and the phonons only _ at the local level_. we will see that the spatial extent of the el - ph correlations increases as the el - ph coupling decreases , which explains the significant discrepancy in the weak - coupling regime .",
    "it is also worth noting that dmft neglects the @xmath59 dependence of self - energy , i.e. , the inverse effective mass is always equal to the quasiparticle weight .",
    "as we have pointed out above , the difference between @xmath43 and @xmath26 is not negligible in the intermediate- to weak - coupling regime .",
    "next , we compute the correlation function between the electron and the phonon displacement ( lattice deformation ) in the ground state , @xmath77 this correlation function can be considered as a measure of the polaron size@xcite .",
    "it should not be confused with the `` polaron radius '' in the extreme adiabatic limit , which refers to the spatial extent of a symmetry - breaking localized state .",
    "we would like to emphasize that a comprehensive study of el - ph correlation for the ground state of the 3d polaron has not yet been reported by any other modern numerical technique@xcite .",

    "again , we obtain good qualitative agreement .",
    "the curves show an abrupt change in slope only for large @xmath39 , where the discrepancy with dmft is largest .",
    "figure [ fig : deform ] shows the effect of dimensionality on the correlation function @xmath81 . in the strong - coupling regime , panel ( a ) shows , in every dimension , a sharp drop on the first two sites and an exponentially decaying tail . for the 3d polaron at a distance of 3 lattice sites , @xmath82 drops below @xmath83 . in the weak - coupling regime ,",
    "panel ( b ) , @xmath84 has nearly a simple exponential decay with a less steep slope , which implies a nontrivial extent of the el - ph interplay in space . in both panels ,",
    "we observe a common trend that @xmath84 decays more rapidly as the lattice dimension increases , i.e. , the surrounding phonons are more localized near the electron in higher dimensions",
    ". this feature enables dmft to give sensible results in higher finite dimensions .",
    "we have also investigated other 2-point el - ph correlation functions such as @xmath85 ( not shown ) , which has dimensional characteristics similar to @xmath84 .",
    "the rapid decay of the el - ph correlation function for the higher - dimensional polaron suggests that the off - site el - ph interplay is relatively weak in large d. one would then expect the comb basis of fig .",

    "figure [ fig : p_comb ] shows @xmath89 as a function of the inverse bare coupling constant @xmath33 for 1 - 4d cases . in both of the limits @xmath90 or @xmath91 , @xmath89 goes to 1 .",
    "the minimum overlap occurs in the crossover regime .",
    "as expected , @xmath89 gets closer to 1 as d increases . for the 3d polaron ,",
    "the minimum of @xmath89 is 91.1% , in contrast to 45.8% for 1d .",
    "these trends can also be seen analytically . in the adiabatic limit ( @xmath92 ) ,",
    "perturbing in @xmath8 from a self - trapped state with energy @xmath93 , the self - trapping transition occurs at @xmath94 .",
    "the leading order correction of @xmath89 for the self - trapped polaron state is @xmath95 in the non - adiabatic limit , @xmath96 can be calculated by scpt to second order in the hopping @xmath8 .",
    "it takes the following form : @xmath97 the above expressions show that for a given @xmath38 and @xmath39 , the discrepancy @xmath96 decreases as d increases and eventually vanishes in infinite d. the comb basis should thus give a good account for the holstein problem in large d. we see in fig .",
    "[ fig : crossover ] , however , that dimension 3 is not high enough for the comb to give quantitatively accurate results , and that dimension 4 is not much better .",
    "convergence to higher dimensions is slow .",
    "most of the recently developed numerical methods are capable of computing the polaron band dispersion in 1d . for the 2d polaron , the only non - perturbative calculations of band dispersion published so far were computed by finite - cluster ed @xcite and quantum monte carlo @xcite . due to the huge phonon hilbert space in high dimensions , the previous ed results are limited to small clusters , so that the band dispersion can only be evaluated at a few @xmath19 points .",
    "the qmc allows calculation of energy at any desired @xmath19 point , but is limited to the condition that the polaron bandwidth is much smaller than the phonon frequency , which corresponds to the strong - coupling regime .",
    "the present variational approach , however , is not subject to any of the above restrictions @xcite . figure [ fig : band](a ) shows the evolution of the band dispersion for the 3d polaron along symmetry directions in the brillouin zone at various el - ph coupling constants @xmath9 .",
    "figure [ fig : band](b ) shows the corresponding @xmath26 . starting with weak coupling @xmath98 ( dashed line ) , the polaron band is close to the bare electron band at lower band edge .",
    "the deviation between them increases as @xmath19 increases .",
    "when @xmath99 approaches @xmath10 , we observe a band flattening effect , similar to the 1d and 2d cases , accompanied by a sharp drop of quasiparticle weight @xmath26 .",
    "the large @xmath59 lowest energy state can be considered roughly as `` a @xmath24 polaron ground state '' plus `` an itinerant ( or weakly - bound ) phonon with momentum @xmath59 '' .",
    "it is the phonon that carries the momentum so as to make @xmath26 essentially vanish and give a bandwidth @xmath100 . due to the large extent of the el - ph correlations in the flattened band ,",
    "our results are less accurate in the flattened regime @xcite . in the case of intermediate coupling @xmath101 ,",
    "the polaron bandwidth is narrower than the phonon frequency .",
    "the upper part of the band has much less dispersion than the lower part but _ with a substantial @xmath26 _ .",
    "this indicates a distinct mechanism for the crossover as a function of @xmath19 . in the case of @xmath102",
    ", the strong el - ph interaction leads to the well - known polaron band collapse and a significant suppression of @xmath26 at all @xmath59 .",
    "four decades ago , a simple and intuitive variational approach to the 1d polaron problem was proposed by toyozawa @xcite .",
    "this method has been successfully applied to various fields and revisited in a number of guises@xcite throughout the years .",
    "it is generally believed to provide a qualitatively correct description of the polaron ground state , aside from predicting a spurious discontinuous change in the mass at intermediate coupling .",
    "we show below that although the toyozawa wavefunction gives a good account of the ground state energy and the 2-point functions , it fails to correctly describe the 3-point functions .",
    "the toyozawa wavefunction is written as a product of coherent states , @xmath103 where @xmath104 is a coherent state of the phonon mode on site @xmath105 . in the antiadiabatic limit @xmath106",

    "for the general case , momentum @xmath24 , the @xmath109 are real and symmetric : @xmath110 . to determine the validity of the toyozawa wavefunction , we probe the structure of the phonon cloud in the @xmath111 ground state by computing the following 2-point and 3-point el - ph correlation functions , @xmath112 the @xmath109 in eq .",

    "it can be proved that the optimal @xmath109 decay exponentially as a function of el - ph separation .",

    "ii , the fractional error in energy is about @xmath113 ( with @xmath114 and @xmath115 ) .",

    "the toyozawa @xmath118 is too large by 6 orders of magnitude .",
    "this failure indicates that the electron does not organize its surrounding phonon cloud in the way that toyozawa suggested .",
    "instead , by directly analyzing the exact ground state wavefunction , we find that the electron organizes its surrounding phonons like a traveling salesman does , namely , the polaron favors the phonon configuration with a shorter creation path .",
    "( the length of the creation path is the number of off - diagonal operations , phonon creations and electron hops , required to create a state from the bare electron state .",

    "the simplest attempt @xmath136 to correct the identified shortcomings in the toyozawa variational wavefunction appears to be a step in the right direction , although not as quantitatively accurate for most properties as variational methods with more parameters @xcite .",

    "the dmft approach thus gives better results in higher dimensions .",
    "our comparison shows that dmft gives qualitatively correct results for the effective mass , mean phonon number , and on - site phonon distortion in the intermediate- to strong - coupling regime .",
    "we also examine the comb - basis approach which limits the el - ph correlation to the on - site level as dmft does .",
