    "the end of the xxth century has witnessed increasing interest among the scientific community for the use of complex networks @xcite as models for many real - world systems , both from empirical and theoretical perspectives . from the empirical point of view , scientists have studied _ real - world _ networks to highlight universal topological properties such as the small - world effect @xcite , highly skewed degree distributions @xcite or assortative mixing @xcite . on the theoretical side",
    ", models have been developed to describe or explain topological properties of networks @xcite , to simulate their evolution in time @xcite and the dynamical processes taking place on them @xcite .",
    "the first models were rather simple : indistinguishable nodes joined by randomly placed edges @xcite . with increasing information on real - world networks , more realistic  and thus more complex",
    " models have been proposed taking into account properties such as an arbitrary degree distribution @xcite , clustering @xcite , degree correlation @xcite , weighed edges @xcite , directed edges @xcite or mixing patterns @xcite . except for a few cases ( bipartite networks @xcite ) ,",
    "many existing models still consider only one type of nodes and therefore neglect any information characterizing the differences among the constituents of the simulated system .",
    "however , especially in social networks , these differences ( sex , age , ethnic group ) may have significant and non - trivial effects on the structure ( assortative mixing , communities ) and on the dynamical property(ies ) of the networks themselves as well as on the dynamics of the phenomena of interest ( such as disease propagation ) throughout the networks @xcite .    in this paper , we present a bond percolation formalism of multitype networks with an arbitrary joint degree distribution where nodes have explicit properties associated with the type they belong to . on the one hand ,",
    "the use of multitype networks allows one to reproduce mixing among nodes such as assortative mixing @xcite or clustering @xcite . on the other hand , the use of heterogeneous bond occupation probability allows one to take into account correlations between the probability of occupation of edges and the nature of the nodes they connect .",
    "when applied to epidemic propagation , we argue that this model adequately represents percolation ( spreading ) processes where such correlations are observed ( infectious diseases whose probability of transmission is correlated with intrinsic physiological and behavioral characteristics of individuals ) .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : multi_net ] , we introduce the multitype networks and define several quantities of interest .",
    "the formalism is developed in sec .",
    "[ sec : pgf_formalism ] where we obtain the occupied degree ( and excess degree ) distributions , the small component sizes , the percolation threshold , and the giant and ( average ) small component sizes .",
    "we also show that our formalism corresponds to a generalization of existing approaches @xcite reducing to known results in the appropriate limits .",
    "this theoretical section is validated with a number of numerical simulations and followed by an application to epidemic dynamics in sec .",
    "[ sec : appl_epid ] , where the previously calculated quantities are interpreted in an epidemiological context .",
    "we also take the opportunity to explain how the proposed approach can overcome some of the correlation issues that should appear in a realistic treatment of epidemic propagation .",
    "our conclusions and final remarks are then collected in the last section .",
    "we consider undirected _ multitype _ networks @xcite defined as undirected networks composed of @xmath0 nodes , each of which are labeled with one of @xmath1 possible types .",
    "type-@xmath2 nodes occupy a fraction @xmath3 of the network and the connections between nodes are prescribed by the degree distribution @xmath4 giving the joint probability for a randomly chosen type-@xmath2 node to be connected to @xmath5 type-1 nodes , @xmath6 type-2 nodes , @xmath7 , @xmath8 type-@xmath1 nodes .",
    "any mixing patterns between nodes such as assortative mixing are incorporated in the model via @xmath9 .",
    "our networks are considered in the limit of large systems ( @xmath10 ) and are totally random in all respects other than the joint degree distribution @xmath9 .. ] therefore , @xmath9 and @xmath3 define a network ensemble over which all quantities obtained with our formalism are averaged .",
    "[ fig : multitype_networks ] shows an example of an undirected multitype network .",
    "we now define @xmath11 as the average number of edges leaving a type-@xmath2 node to type-@xmath12 nodes , directly obtained from @xmath9 as @xmath13 even if every edge in our networks is undirected , the presence of different types of nodes adds an _ artificial _ direction to edges .",
    "indeed , one can follow a link from a type-@xmath2 node to a type-@xmath12 node ( noted @xmath14 ) or in the opposite direction ( @xmath15 ) . since the degree distribution @xmath9 prescribes the number of edges _ leaving _ type-@xmath2 nodes , a given edge joining a type-@xmath2 and a type-@xmath12 node will be considered from two different perspectives .",
    "therefore , to guarantee the consistency of the network ensemble , @xmath9 and @xmath3 must respect the condition @xmath16 where @xmath17 when @xmath10 .",
    "this constraint relies on having as many edges of type @xmath14 as of type @xmath15 . as of type @xmath15 and will naturally be respected . ] note that implies @xmath18 non - trivial generally overdetermined equations .",
    "thus , one must use values for @xmath9 and @xmath3 that explicitly fulfill .",
    "the case @xmath19 is special in that @xmath3 can be uniquely determined from @xmath9 @xmath20 with @xmath21 .    having now defined networks where one can identify the type of nodes , we are able to apply different probabilities of occupation according to how edges are followed .",
    "thus , instead of having only one edge occupation probability @xmath22 , as in other percolation models @xcite , we define the bond occupation probability matrix @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the occupation probability of the @xmath14 edges",
    ". note that @xmath25 does not need to be symmetric and the probability of occupation of @xmath14 edges can vary between edges of the same type ( linking the same ordered pair @xmath26 ) as long as those values are independent identically distributed ( _ iid _ ) random variables .",
    "the value of @xmath24 is then simply the mean of their distribution @xcite and is totally independent of @xmath27 , which is the mean of a different and independent distribution .    in view of the possible asymmetry of the probability of occupation ,",
    "our approach is somewhat different from the traditional bond percolation treatment which assumes a symmetric @xmath25",
    ". it would perhaps be more appropriate to refer to our system as a _ semi - directed bond percolation_. this denomination stems from the following point of view : one formally replaces every edge of the original undirected network by two directed edges running in opposite directions and then uses the corresponding probability of occupation for each directed edges .",
    "this leads to a semi - directed network whose percolation properties are easier to analyse . therefore , the introduction of multitypes together with the tranmissibility matrix allows us to cover systems ranging from classical bond percolation ( symmetric @xmath25 ) to spreading processes ( asymmetric symmetric @xmath25 ) where directionality ( e.g. causality ) is implicitly present . on this basis",
    ", we develop the multitype formalism in the next section .",
    "we now present a formalism that describes the heterogeneous bond percolation of multitype networks .",
    "it is based on probability generating functions ( pgf ) @xcite and is a generalization to multitype networks of the formalism developed earlier by newman @xcite .",
    "the first quantity needed to describe the percolation properties is the occupied degree distribution @xmath28 , the distribution of the number of occupied edges leaving a randomly chosen type-@xmath2 node . assuming independence in the edges occupation state , the probability that a randomly chosen node has @xmath29 occupied edges is @xmath30 the probability that a randomly chosen node has @xmath29 occupied edges is then",
    "simply @xmath31 where the summation convention is defined in ( [ eq : z_ij ] ) here covering the ranges @xmath32 for @xmath33 .",
    "this probability is generated by the pgf @xmath34",
    "@xmath35^{k_l}. \\label{eq : g_i}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we see that @xmath36 if @xmath9 is properly normalized .",
    "we can obtain the average occupied degree @xmath37 , the average number of occupied edges leaving a type-@xmath2 node to nodes , by using the differentiation property @xcite of generating functions @xmath38 where @xmath11 is the average degree defined by .      another useful and accessible quantity in our formalism",
    "is the occupied _ excess _ degree distribution @xmath39 .",
    "the _ excess _ degree is defined as the number of edges leaving a node that have been reached by following a randomly chosen edge . for undirected _ unitype _ networks ( @xmath40 ) , this quantity is simply the node s degree minus one ( the edge that has already been followed ) .",
    "more information is required for multitype networks ; one needs to know the type of node at both ends of the followed edge to correctly calculate the excess degree .",
    "this quantity is proportional to @xmath41 since high degree nodes are more likely to be reached from a randomly chosen edge than low degree nodes . assuming independence in the occupation state of edges , the occupied excess degree distribution of a type-@xmath12 node reached from an @xmath14 edge is given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 is the delta of krnecker .",
    "defining @xmath45 as the generating function associated with this distribution , we have @xmath46^{k_l-\\delta_{il}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which can also be obtained from @xmath47 by differentiation @xmath48 where @xmath37 is the average occupied degree defined by .",
    "we now wish to calculate the size distribution of _ small _ components in the network ensemble .",
    "a component is any closed set ( cluster ) of nodes connected by occupied edges .",
    "the adjective small is meant to qualify any _ intensive _ component ( one that does not scale with the network size ) .",
    "let us first define @xmath49 as the function generating the size distribution of the component reached by following an @xmath14 edge .",
    "small components are typically finite , except at the phase transition where their average size diverges @xcite .",
    "thus , we expect the probability of finding closed loops in finite components to go as , which is negligible in the large system size limit ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "small components are therefore treelike in structure and @xmath49 can be decomposed in an additive set of contributions as graphically shown at fig .",
    "[ fig : contributions ] for the case @xmath19 .",
    "the size distribution of a small cluster reached from an @xmath14 edge arises from two situations : either the edge reaches a node that has no outgoing occupied edges ( i.e. occupied excess degree = 0 ) , or it reaches a node that has outgoing occupied edges ( i.e. occupied excess degre @xmath50 0 ) that lead to other clusters whose size distribution is given by @xmath51 as well . is invariant under translation on the network , one always sees the same small components size distribution independently where he / she stands in the small component . ]    noting that the distribution of outgoing edges is given by @xmath45 and using the _ power _ property @xcite of generating functions leads to the consistency relation @xmath52 where the right - hand side of the equation must be read as @xmath53 .",
    "the solution to is found by seeking the stable fixed point of the mapping @xmath54 as @xmath55 for initial conditions @xmath56 . technically , the existence of a stable fixed point is guaranteed by the presence of the    @xmath57 factor in .",
    "indeed , it implies that the coefficients in front of variables whose powers sum to @xmath58 are exact after precisely @xmath59 iterations .",
    "let us next consider a randomly chosen type-@xmath2 node .",
    "each of its leaving edges leads to a component whose size distribution is generated by @xmath49 . defining @xmath60 as the function generating the size distribution of the whole component , we have @xmath61 since type-@xmath2 nodes occupy a fraction @xmath3 of the network , the size distribution of the component reached from a randomly chosen node",
    "is generated by @xmath62 similar equations to and have already been derived in @xcite to obtain the size distribution of the small component reached from a randomly chosen type-@xmath2 node .",
    "however , the pgfs used there were functions of only one variable instead of @xmath1 ( @xmath63 instead of @xmath64 ) and therefore did not generate the composition of the small component ( the number of nodes of each type ) . thus , and are generalized versions of previoulsy derived expressions .",
    "percolation is usually characterized by the divergence of the correlation length .",
    "this translates here in the divergence of the average size @xmath65 of small components . using the _ moments _ property @xcite of pgfs , the average number of type-@xmath2 nodes in the small component reached from a randomly chosen node",
    "is obtained by differentiating with respect to @xmath66 @xmath67 where @xmath68 are the solutions of @xmath69 we have isolated in the average number of type-@xmath58 nodes that can be reached from a type-@xmath12 node arrived at by following a @xmath70 edge ( average excess degree ) @xmath71 which only depends on the network structure ( its degree distribution ) and is therefore known .",
    "thus , to obtain @xmath72 , one simply has to solve , @xmath1 sets of @xmath73 equations and @xmath73 unknowns .",
    "it can be shown that all @xmath74 are inversely proportional to @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the identity matrix and @xmath77 is a @xmath78 block matrix whose blocks ( @xmath79 ) are themselves @xmath78 matrices with @xmath80_{\\mu\\nu } = t_{ij}\\beta_{\\mu\\nu}^{(j ) } \\delta_{i\\nu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] giving the @xmath81 element of the @xmath82 block .",
    "for example , in the case @xmath19 , @xmath77 takes the form @xmath83 \\begin{bmatrix } \\makebox[\\bw]{$t_{11}\\beta_{11}^{(1)}$ } & \\makebox[\\bw]{$0 $ } \\\\",
    "\\makebox[\\bw]{$t_{11}\\beta_{21}^{(1)}$ } & \\makebox[\\bw]{$0 $ } \\end{bmatrix } & \\begin{bmatrix } \\makebox[\\bw]{$t_{12}\\beta_{11}^{(2)}$ } & \\makebox[\\bw]{$0 $ } \\\\",

    "\\makebox[\\bw]{$0 $ } & \\makebox[\\bw]{$t_{22}\\beta_{22}^{(2)}$ } \\end{bmatrix } \\\\[3ex ] \\end{bmatrix}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from , we see that the average size @xmath65 of the component reached from a randomly chosen node diverges as @xmath84 for @xmath85",
    ". therefore the phase transition happens when @xmath86 which marks the point where the giant component first appears .",
    "this result is in accord with the corresponding expression found in @xcite and , as noted earlier , is again more general .      beyond the percolation threshold",
    ", there is an _ extensive _ cluster ( the giant component ) in the network . in , @xmath49 has been defined as generating the size distribution of _ finite _ components .",
    "thus , @xmath49 , @xmath60 and @xmath87 are no longer normalized beyond the percolation threshold since it is not guaranteed that a randomly chosen edge / node will lead to a finite component ( although a fraction of them may lead to the giant component ) .",
    "therefore , the probability that a randomly chosen type-@xmath2 node leads to the giant component is simply @xmath88 with @xmath89 .",
    "we have noted @xmath90 ( read @xmath91 _ forward _ ) as the probability that a randomly chosen @xmath14 edge leads to a finite component , and is the solution of @xmath92 obtained by evaluating at @xmath93 . if one randomly chooses a node in the network , the probability that it leads to the giant component is therefore @xmath94    to calculate the size of the giant component , one needs to know the probability that a randomly chosen node is _ not _ linked to the giant component by any of its edges ( that this node can not be reached from the giant component ) .",
    "one simple way to obtain this information is to study the network topology by following every edges _ backwards_.",
    "this can be achieved with our formalism by simply using @xmath95 ( the transpose of @xmath25 ) instead of @xmath25 since any given type-@xmath2 node can be left ( reached ) by any of its edges with the probability @xmath24 ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "we define @xmath96 ( read @xmath91 _ backward _ ) as the probability that a given type-@xmath2 node can not be reached from the giant component by a @xmath15 edge .",
    "this quantity is calculated as solution of @xmath97 therefore , we see that @xmath98 is the probability that a randomly chosen type-@xmath2 node does not belong to the giant component .",
    "the fraction of the network occupied by type-@xmath2 nodes that are in the giant component is thus given by @xmath99\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the size of the giant component is @xmath100 in comparing and , one will see that asymmetry of the bond occupation probability matrix implies that @xmath101 .",
    "this quantitative difference between @xmath102 and @xmath103 resides in the asymmetry in the number of occupied edges of type @xmath14 and of type @xmath15 . a naive generalization of the formalism introduced in @xcite would have missed the distinction between @xmath102 and @xmath103 . clearly for symmetric transmissibility @xmath104 , one would have @xmath105 .",
    "a similar result has previously been discussed in @xcite for semi - directed networks and , with different approaches , it has been obtained for _ undirected _ networks in @xcite .",
    "the present demonstration is a new extension to the latter class of networks .      above the percolation threshold ,",
    "@xmath87 still generates the size distribution of the finite component reached from a randomly chosen node , although it needs to be normalized according to @xmath106 since @xmath107 .",
    "the general expression for @xmath72 is therefore @xmath108 where @xmath74 is the average number of type-@xmath2 nodes in the finite component reached by a randomly chosen @xmath70 edge and is the solution of @xmath109 analogously to , @xmath110 one can see that  reduce to  in absence of the giant component since in this case @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "technically ,  can be very useful to obtain information on the small components without having to solve ",
    ", a very time consuming operation for large @xmath1 or for networks with large small components .",
    "it is also possible to calculate the second moments of @xmath87 @xmath113 \\right|_{\\bm{x}=\\bm{1}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from which the covariance matrix of the small components size is obtained .",
    "clearly , iterative equations for @xmath114 , similar to and , can be derived to calculate the covariance matrix without solving . higher moments can also be obtained in a similar way .",
    "we now show that , in corresponding limit cases , our formalism reproduces the already published theoretical results .",
    "firstly , one can easily verify that all of the equations in the previous section reduce to the ones in @xcite when @xmath40 .",
    "secondly , equations associated with the components ( small or giant ) in @xcite can be obtained by setting @xmath115 in our equations and @xmath116 in and .",
    "thirdly , results obtained from a semi - directed formalism such as the one in @xcite can also be obtained with our formalism by setting @xmath117 for some @xmath26 pairs while keeping @xmath118 .",
    "fourthly , for bipartite networks ( @xmath19 ) , all edges are connecting different types of nodes and the constraint @xmath119 must be imposed , implying that @xmath120 @xmath121 and @xmath122 are then undefined . from",
    ", we see that the phase transition in this case , @xmath123 , occurs when @xmath124 a result previously obtained in @xcite .",
    "moreover , one can obtain the average number of type-1 nodes in the component reached from a randomly chosen type-1 node @xmath125 under the percolation threshold by differentiating with respect to @xmath66 and solving @xmath126 a result also obtained by the authors of @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is possible to calculate the size of the giant component as in @xcite by setting @xmath127 in and with the constraints listed above .",
    "an even more general constraint @xmath128 can be used to obtain a formalism for multipartite networks .",
    "our approach can therefore incorporate clustering effects by assigning some of the node types to groups and then using the projected network ( where nodes belonging to the same group are linked together ) as proposed in @xcite .",
    "over the years , mathematical models @xcite have provided insights on the factors influencing diseases propagation dynamics and have improved testing intervention / prevention strategies .",
    "outbreaks of respiratory pathogens ( sars @xcite ) and sexually transmitted infections ( stis ) have encouraged the emergence of models using network theory to capture the patterns of potential disease - causing interactions between individuals @xcite . despite the many successes ,",
    "most of these models are still based on a simplifying assumption , which limits the realistic simulation of disease propagation for certain categories of diseases . before discussing how the quantities obtained from our formalism can be translated in an epidemiological setting , we briefly state some of the difficulties associated with a realistic epidemic dynamics and the possible advantage of a multitype description .",
    "the _ iid _ hypothesis @xcite assumes that the probability of transmission between any pair of individuals is an _",
    "independent identically distributed _ random variable taken from a given distribution .",
    "thus , the _ a priori _ probability of transmission , @xmath22 , between any two individuals is the mean of this distribution and , in the population as a whole , the disease will propagate from an infectious individual to a susceptible one with the same probability @xmath22 .",
    "this implies that no correlations , whatsoever , can be taken into account .",
    "however , the probability of transmission of infectious diseases is typically dependent on intrinsic immunological and behavioral traits of individuals .",
    "many infectious diseases show heterogeneity in their transmissibility .",
    "for example , the human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) has a higher efficiency of transmission from male to female than female to male @xcite .",
    "there is also strong evidences that co - infection with other stis could facilitate hiv transmission @xcite . in regards to influenza",
    ", it has been shown that children ( under 15 years old ) are more likely to transmit the disease than adults @xcite .",
    "further , it has been shown that the _ iid _ hypothesis fails to adequately model _ susceptible - infectious - recovered _",
    "( sir ) dynamics when the distribution of the infectious period @xmath129 is not sharp around a given value @xmath130 @xcite .",
    "therefore , most existing percolation approaches fail to realistically simulate the propagation of some infectious diseases due to the inability of the _ iid _ hypothesis to model the correlations between individual s traits ( including their infectious period ) and the probability of transmission .",
    "if one could identify specific individuals within the network , one could determine _ who infects whom _ and it would become possible to apply the appropriate probability of transmission .",
    "hence , difficulties raised by the heterogeneity in transmissibility could be largely overcome by considering node heterogeneity .",
    "this suggests that , in order to properly model the propagation of a large class of diseases , one could separate the nodes into a sufficient number of categories ( types ) to insure that the _ iid _ hypothesis can be applied correctly .",
    "our multitype formalism can then be used to investigate the percolation properties of the corresponding system .",
    "confronted with a situation where the infectious period is broadly distributed and heterogeneity is present , one could adopt the following line of action . in the case of influenza , one could split the population between adults and children ; or between male and female when modeling hiv propagation . the probability of transmission could still vary according to the _ iid _ hypothesis , within the same type of edges , if nodes are separated into a sufficient number of groups , within each of which all significant correlations are explicitly included .",
    "the finite width of the infectious period distribution @xmath129 can be accounted for by simply dividing its contribution into a sufficient number of duration subdomains @xmath131 $ ] ( each associated with a node type randomly distributed in the population if more detailed information is not available ) and using the corresponding transmissibility in our model .",
    "the fraction of the network occupied by type-@xmath2 nodes will then be @xmath132 .",
    "the same procedure is also applicable if the susceptibility of individuals is heterogeneous .",
    "we now interpret the quantities that can be calculated with our formalism in an epidemiological context .",
    "the contact network topology is prescribed by @xmath9 and @xmath3 while the bond occupation probability matrix entries , @xmath24 , are the average probability of transmission from infectious individuals of type @xmath2 to susceptible individuals of type @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath60 generates the outbreak size distribution caused by patient zero ( the first known individual to become infected who directly or indirectly causes all subsequent infections ) of type-@xmath2 ( adult , child ; male , female ) .",
    "similarly , @xmath87 generates the outbreak size distribution caused by a patient zero of any type .",
    "the quantity @xmath72 is the average number of type-@xmath2 individuals infected from patient zero and @xmath133 is the expected size of an outbreak .",
    "one could also differentiate with respect to @xmath57 to obtain the average number of type-@xmath12 individuals infected by a patient zero of type-@xmath2 ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : special_cases ] ) .",
    "those quantities can be useful , for example , in evaluating the impact of strategies focused on the reduction of morbidity in specific population groups ( health care workers , the elderly ) .    for a given contact network ,",
    "@xmath75 is a polynomial in powers of the elements of @xmath25 whose coefficients depend only of the network topology .",
    "thus , the percolation threshold , @xmath123 , defines the _ critical transmissibility set _ over which there is a non - zero probability that an outbreak will turn into a large - scale epidemic .",
    "the probability that such an epidemic will occur is given by @xmath102 and by @xmath134 if patient zero is known to be of type-@xmath2 .",
    "should an epidemic occur , the fraction of the population that will eventually be infected is given by @xmath103 while @xmath135 indicates the fraction of the population of infected individuals of type @xmath2 .",
    "note that if an outbreak dies out while having infected only a finite number of individuals ( or a small number compared to the size of the population ) , the expected number of infected individuals of type @xmath2 is still given by @xmath72 computed with ( this remark holds for @xmath65 as well ) .      to illustrate how our formalism could be applied in an epidemiological context and to confirm its predictions ,",
    "we have performed extensive computer simulations on multitype networks of @xmath136 nodes divided into two types .",
    "we have considered a contact network where the distribution of the total degree ( @xmath137 ) of individuals is given by a power - law with an exponential cutoff and where the probability that an edge leaving a type-@xmath2 node arrives on a type-@xmath12 node is given by @xmath138 .",
    "thus , the joint degree distribution of our network is @xmath139 with the parameters @xmath140 ; \\qquad \\bm{\\kappa } = \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } 8 \\\\ 10 \\end{array } \\right ] ; \\qquad \\bm{p } = \\left [ \\begin{array}{cc } 0.7 & 0.3 \\\\ 0.4 & 0.6 \\end{array } \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath141 denotes the @xmath142th polylogarithm of @xmath143 @xcite ( also known as jonquire s function ) .",
    "we have used a simple joint degree distribution to    illustrate our point ; nonetheless our formalism is very general and @xmath144 could include many non - trivial correlations as shown in @xcite . to show the effect of the asymmetry of @xmath25 on @xmath102 and @xmath103 , we have used the following transmissibility matrix @xmath145\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath146 allows us to vary the infectiousness of the disease .",
    "the specific choice of the elements of @xmath25 has no particular relevance here , except perhaps to result in large @xmath102 and @xmath103 values for @xmath147 . by solving @xmath123 for @xmath146 , we find that the epidemic transition occurs when @xmath148",
    ".    we have generated 2000 multitype networks following a method similar to the one described in @xcite , with the degree distribution presented above .",
    "we have then performed epidemic simulations by infecting a randomly chosen node and allowing the disease to propagate with probabilities given by @xmath25 . above the percolation threshold",
    ", we have identified the components ( small or giant ) by setting a size - parameter , a percentage of the total number of nodes , below which the cluster was registered to belong to the set of small components .",
    "experimentation has shown the final results rather insensitive to the exact value of the size - parameter and we have settled conservatively for a value of 0.5% of @xmath0 .",
    "figure [ fig : size_distribution ] compares the distribution of the number of infected nodes of each type caused by an outbreak predicted by , with the results of numerical simulations under ( @xmath149 ) and above ( @xmath150 ) the epidemic threshold .",
    "one observes a very good agreement between the theoretical prediction and the simulations .",
    "this quantitative accord ( in this figure and the following ones ) is representative of a much larger set of calculations carried out with different values of the transmissibility matrix elements .",
    "figure [ fig : average_size ] shows the average number of infected nodes in an outbreak for each type of node and for different values of @xmath146 .",
    "theoretical predictions are obtained from .",
    "again , an excellent agreement between our model predictions and numerical simulations is recorded ; the small disagreement around the percolation threshold is caused by the finite size of the networks used for the simulations .",
    "indeed as @xmath0 decreases , finite size effects become important and the formalism would have to be modified along the lines described in @xcite , for instance .",
    "preliminary results indicate however that agreement between results of the present formalism and numerical simulations is maintained , even if the size of the network is reduced to @xmath151 .",
    "a more extensive study of the issue of finite size in a multitype network is under investigation .",
    "finally , fig .",
    "[ fig : giant_comp ] compares the values predicted by our model for the probability of an epidemic to occur ( @xmath102 ) and its relative size ( @xmath152 , @xmath153 and @xmath103 ) with simulation results for different values of @xmath146 .",
    "again , there is a very good agreement between the theoretical predictions and results from simulations .",
    "the asymmetry of @xmath25 is responsible for the significant difference between @xmath102 and @xmath103 ( up to approximately 10% in this case ) .",
    "we also see that the presence of node types allows more detailed information on the final state of an epidemic since it is then possible to determine the number of individuals of each type that are infected during an epidemic",
    ". moreover , fig .",
    "[ fig : giant_comp ] demonstrates that these numbers do not remain proportional for varying transmissibilities .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , such information was not possible to obtain in previous percolation models .",
    "furthermore , the heterogeneity in transmissibility in our formalism allows one to test more specific public - health policies . for instance , one could study the effectiveness of age - specific influenza control strategies such as vaccination , face masks or hand - washing by varying the transmissibility matrix entries for the relevant age groups .",
    "therefore , the multitype approach of our model offers more detailed information on outbreak outcomes .",
    "this is very useful when comparing the cost - effectiveness of prevention or intervention strategies .",
    "in this paper , we have introduced a bond percolation formalism on multitype networks .",
    "the formalism explicitly allows heterogeneity in the edge occupation probability via the matrix @xmath25 whose elements @xmath24 are the probability for an @xmath14 edge to be occupied . using probability generating functions ( pgf ) ,",
    "we have    obtained several exact forms of classical statistical properties ( in the limit of large networks ) such as , the size distribution of small components , the probability of reaching the giant component from any node as well as its relative size .",
    "furthermore , the presence of node types has allowed us to obtain more detailed information on the composition of small components , the giant component , and a general expression for the percolation threshold .",
    "we have also obtained iterative equations for the average number of type-@xmath2 nodes in the small component , which allows to easily and rapidly obtain information on the network structure .",
    "we have also shown that our model is a generalized version of various existing approaches based on the pgf .",
    "many known results and effects can be obtained with our model .",
    "for instance , equations describing the bond percolation of multipartite networks can easily be derived from our formalism .",
    "while semi - directed networks have been previously used to simulate the asymmetry between population groups infecting each other @xcite , this effect can be achieved with our undirected network model by setting @xmath117 for some @xmath26 pairs while keeping @xmath118 .",
    "thus , type-@xmath12 nodes will be able to infect type-@xmath2 nodes , while transmission in the other direction will not be possible .",
    "a completely general semi - directed extension of our formalism ( with @xmath154 variables , say @xmath64 , @xmath155 , @xmath156 , for the 3 ways to move across the network , following the links forward , backward and in both directions ) is straightforward to derive .",
    "this extended formalism would be required when the underlying network includes directed edges whose presence can not be randomly determined with a probability @xmath24 that solely depends on the edge type ( here @xmath14 ) , , additional correlations exist .",
    "these structural properties have considerable influence on the dynamical processes taking place on networks ; this , in turn , can have a significant impact on their topology .",
    "therefore , a formalism such as the one presented in this paper can be used to probe and characterize the structure ( by setting @xmath157 ) of an evolving network at a given time in order to predict the network s topological evolution .",
    "the approach described in this paper , when compared to previous methods , facilitates more realistic simulations of the propagation of infectious diseases manifesting heterogeneity in their transmissibility .",
    "we argue that heterogeneity in nodes is a way to overcome some correlation issues caused by heterogeneous transmissibility .",
    "in addition , the presence of different types of nodes allows the simulation of many non - trivial mixing patterns observed in real - world networks , such as assortativity , the preferential connection between different types of nodes ; and clustering , the fact that nodes belonging to a specific group are more likely to be connected to one another in the contact network .",
    "thus , the proposed model is suitable for more detailed and more precise epidemiological investigations ( impact of intervention or prevention strategies on specific population groups ) resulting in more adapted and effective recommendations to public health authorities .",
    "hopefully , models such as the one presented in this paper joined with ever increasing theoretical developments will contribute to the improvement of public health policies .",
