    "the response of systems with quenched disorder to an applied field or force is typically hysteretic and noisy .",
    "a well - known example is the barkhausen noise in ferromagnetic materials that results from the intermittent motion of magnetic domain walls in response to a change in the external magnetic field@xcite .",
    "this behavior , which is observed in a wide variety of physical systems , from superconductors@xcite to martensitic shape - memory alloys@xcite , can be related to the complicated structure of the energy landscape , with a huge number of local minima ( or metastable states ) separated by large energy barriers , which makes thermal fluctuations irrelevant on experimental time scales .",
    "a jump or avalanche then corresponds to the disappearance of a local minimum in the landscape as the external field is changed .",
    "much effort has been devoted in recent years to describe the avalanche statistics in various models and to explain the origin of the power - law distributions that are ubiquitously observed .",
    "depending on the model and the details of the dynamics , scale - invariance results from self - organized criticality or requires fine tuning of the system parameters@xcite .    in the theoretical description",
    ", one usually considers a zero - temperature dynamical evolution , which implies that the system , prepared in some known initial configuration , visits a deterministic sequence of metastable states ( similarly , at the thermodynamic equilibrium , the system jumps from one global energy minimum to another while the field is changed ) .",
    "therefore , the stochastic character of the output signal only reflects the intrinsinc disorder in the system and the whole information about the nonequilibrium response , for instance at criticality , is encoded in the energy landscape .",
    "this means that it should be possible in principle ( but maybe nontrivial in practice ) to describe the disorder - averaged properties of the response using a statistical description of the metastable states , that is _ without _ taking into account the entire history of the system .",
    "of course , this supposes that the nonequilibrium path can be characterized unambiguously , for instance by some `` extremal '' property .",
    "this is illustrated in the present work where we study a simple mean - field model for which a complete analytical description of the distribution of the metastable states can be reached .",
    "this model was introduced in ref.@xcite as the starting point for a renormalization - group description of the nonequilibrium , zero - temperature random - field ising model ( rfim ) , and it may be also the basis for a similar study of the energy landscape .    the zero - temperature gaussian rfim with a metastable dynamics is a prototype for a large class of disordered systems with avalanchelike behavior@xcite .",
    "the main feature in three and higher dimensions is the existence of a nonequilibrium critical point that separates two different regimes of avalanches@xcite . above the critical disorder , all avalanches ( i.e. barkhausen jumps )",
    "are of microscopic size and the saturation hysteresis loop , obtained by cycling the magnetic field adiabatically from large negative to large positive values and back , is smooth in the thermodynamic limit . below the critical disorder",
    ", there is a macroscopic avalanche at a certain field and the hysteresis loop is discontinuous . in the following ,",
    "we consider a soft - spin version of the rfim where a spin can take any value between @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and we study the mean - field limit where every spin interacts equally with every other spin .",
    "the model can then be viewed as a collection of identical bistable ( or preisach ) units interacting via a mean - field term .",
    "this type of model is very popular in the hysteresis community ( see e.g. ref.@xcite ) and its properties have been studied in great detail . however , as far as we know , the issues that we want discuss here have not been addressed .",
    "the relationship between the hysteresis loop in the zero - temperature rfim and the distribution of the metastable states in the field - magnetization plane was investigated analytically and numerically in a series of recent papers@xcite .",
    "the information about the distribution of the metastable states in the @xmath2 plane is encoded in the `` quenched '' complexity @xmath3 which is the logarithm ( divided by the number of spins ) of the typical number of metastable states at the field @xmath4 with a given magnetization per spin @xmath5 .",
    "the number of metastable states grows exponentially with the system size when @xmath3 is positive , and it appears that the curve @xmath6 exactly coincides with the saturation hysteresis loop in the large - disorder regime@xcite .",
    "the situation at low disorder is more complicated but more interesting , and it has been conjectured that the boundary of the domain of existence of the metastable states coincides with the hysteresis loop obtained by externally controlling the magnetization instead of the magnetic field .",
    "this is an issue which is also relevant to some experimental situations@xcite .",
    "our aim in this work is to check analytically this whole scenario in the mean - field model .",
    "we shall also consider energetics aspects which play an important role at low disorder where phase transitions occur , depending on the energy of the metastable states .",
    "this information is encoded in the magnetization and energy dependent complexity @xmath7 .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we present the model and briefly review the hysteretic behavior discussed in ref.@xcite . in sec .",
    "iii , we compute the complexity , first as a function of magnetization only and then as a function of magnetization and energy .",
    "we focus on the low - disorder regime where phase transitions occur , both in equilibrium ( i.e. in the ground state ) and out of equilibrium along the hysteresis loop . in sec .",
    "iv , we compute the nonequilibrium response obtained by controlling the magnetization and discuss its relationship with the usual hysteresis loop and the complexity . section v concludes with a brief discussion .",
    "we consider a collection of @xmath8 soft spins interacting via the hamitonian @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a ferromagnetic coupling , @xmath4 is an external uniform field , and @xmath11 is a set of quenched random fields drawn independently from a probability distribution @xmath12 ( in practice , this will be a gaussian distribution with zero mean and standard deviation @xmath13 ) .",
    "@xmath14 is a double - well potential that mimics the two states of the hard - spin model . as in ref.@xcite",
    ", we will choose @xmath15 with @xmath16 ( this condition ensures that the magnetization remains finite at any field @xmath4@xcite ) .",
    "the `` metastable '' states are the local minima of the hamiltonian where each spin satisfies @xmath17 , i.e. @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the magnetization per spin .",

    "@xmath21 ) . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath22 can be either positive or negative for @xmath23 . as a consequence ,",
    "there is a field interval where the number of metastable states with magnetization @xmath5 grows exponentially with @xmath8 ( and the corresponding complexity is positive ) .",
    "this contrasts with the mean - field ising model studied in ref.@xcite where this number is finite ( and actually very small ) in the thermodynamic limit .    at @xmath24 , when increasing the external field adiabatically from @xmath0 , a spin remains negative as long as eq .",

    "we have especially focused on the domain @xmath198 within which the complexity is positive and the number of metastable states grows exponentially with the system size ( and the domain @xmath199 associated to @xmath200 ) .",

    "\\3 ) in zero external field , there is a second - order line in the disorder - energy plane that separates a paramagnetic and a ferromagnetic phase : the ground state and the low - lying metastable states are magnetized at low disorder .",
    "this study provides a pedagogical illustration of the fact that the zero - temperature , nonequilibrium response of the system to a slow external driving can be defined unambiguously from a statistical description of the metastable states in some appropriate limit .",
    "this suggests that the ground state and the metastable states along the hysteresis loop can be studied within a unique and purely static theoretical framework , which may offer a possible new starting point to investigate the relationship between the critical behavior of the rfim in and out of equilibrium@xcite .",
    "to which extent the mean - field picture remains valid when the interaction is short - ranged ?",
    "it is of course impossible in this case to perform a detailed study of the distribution of the metastable states in energy or magnetization .",
    "however , previous numerical@xcite and analytical@xcite studies suggest that the essential qualitative features observed in the mean - field model survive in finite dimension , in particular the presence of a gap in the magnetization of the metastable states at low disorder , gap which is at the origin of the jump along the field - driven hysteresis loop ( note that in finite connectivity models , this gap is not related to the existence of an `` unstable '' solution to the self - consistent equations describing the hysteresis loop@xcite : this solution is an artifact of the mean - field limit ) .",
    "there is also numerical evidence that the low - energy metastable states of the @xmath201d rfim in zero field are magnetized at low disorder@xcite , suggesting that the phase diagram of the metastable states as a function of energy and disorder is qualitatively similar to the one displayed in fig .",
    ".    on the other hand , there are also some noticeable new features in finite - connectivity models .",
    "firstly , the critical values of the disorder associated to the equilibrium ( ground - state ) and nonequilibrium ( hysteresis ) phase transitions become distinct@xcite , with @xmath202 . secondly , in the low - disorder regime",
    ", the complexity may not be zero along the whole boundary of the domain @xmath199 ( this is still putative but supported by analytical calculations on the bethe lattice at the order @xmath203)@xcite .",
    "thirdly , the geometry of the lattice may change qualitatively the nonequilibrium response of the system obtained by controlling the magnetization .",
    "preliminary simulations on a cubic lattice show a feature that was noticed in previous work@xcite and that has been recently discussed in ref.@xcite : when the disorder is low enough , the induced field @xmath190 exhibit strong fluctuations around a certain value @xmath204 that does not depend on the magnetization . as a result ,",
    "the domain @xmath199 has a very peculiar shape in this regime .",
    "the behavior around @xmath204 actually corresponds to interface configurations in real space , and the fluctuations are similar to those observed at a critical depinning transition .",
