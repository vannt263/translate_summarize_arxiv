    "_ @xcite have recently measured the line - shape @xmath1 of photoemitted electrons in the ferromagnetic metal gd . for photoelectrons associated with a photohole in the @xmath2 surface band",
    ", they find somewhat different life - time broadening depending on whether the emitted electron has up ( majority ) or down ( minority ) spin .",
    "they interpret the source of lifetime broadening to be electron - phonon scattering for the majority spin component of the photohole , and electron - magnon scattering for the minority spin component of the photohole . although the arguments given by fedorov _ et al . _",
    "seem perfectly sensible , nevertheless , this interesting diversity suggests a need for theoretical inquiry .",
    "the magnitude of electron - phonon scattering in gd has previously @xcite been estimated , with results roughly agreeing with the assigned majority spin equilibration rate .",
    "electron - magnon scattering has not previously been estimated .    here",
    "i argue that the `` s - f '' or `` ferromagnetic kondo lattice '' model allows reasonable estimates without free parameters .",
    "i make an extreme model for the nature of surface electron and surface magnon states : surface electron states have amplitude 1 on the top layer and zero elsewhere , while magnon states at the surface @xcite are simply the bulk bloch states , ignoring surface boundary conditions . using this model , and the measured mass @xmath3 of the surface hole band , the zero temperature equilibration rate of minority spin holes more than 25mev from the top of the hole band",
    "is predicted to be @xmath40.10 ev , agreeing with the experiment .",
    "the generic hamiltonian for the `` s - f '' or `` ferromagnetic kondo lattice '' model couples electron bands @xmath5 with energy @xmath6 ( independent of spin , so far ) to localized spins @xmath7 located on atoms at lattice sites @xmath8 : @xmath9 the electron bands derive from the outer atomic orbitals @xmath10 with wavefunctions @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the spin part .",
    "this model should describe the low - energy spin - related physics of a metal like gd , with three conduction electrons per atom in orbitals derived from atomic @xmath13 and @xmath14 states of gd .",
    "these three orbitals have a magnetic interaction with the well - localized @xmath15 half - filled @xmath16 shell .",
    "the exchange parameter @xmath17 comes from the atomic hund s rule trying to keep `` electron '' spins parallel to `` core '' spins .",
    "the same hamiltonian , in the @xmath18 limit , is known as the `` double exchange hamiltonian '' @xcite and is very popular right now @xcite for discussions of hole - doped lamno@xmath19 .    the zero temperature phase diagram of the s - f model ( for a single @xmath13 band ) as a function of filling and @xmath20band - width ratio has been computed approximately @xcite .",
    "ferromagnetic order occurs over a wide range of parameters , with a curie temperature ( @xmath21=292k for gd ) proportional to @xmath17 .",
    "electron bands acquire a spin splitting proportional to @xmath17 .",
    "@xcite used the model to calculate ( in random - phase approximation ) the spin - wave dispersion , which was measured for gd by koehler _",
    "@xcite , and which has been studied using spin - density functional theory by perlov _",

    "the @xmath28 term in lowest order gives spin splitting @xmath29 , lowering the energy of bands with spin parallel to the localized spin @xmath30 and raising the other bands equally .",
    "the @xmath31 terms give rise to spin - flip scattering events .    in this note",
    "i estimate the rate @xmath32 at which a single out - of - equilibrium hole in a surface band relaxes back toward equilibrium by spin - flip processes . the rate can be found from @xmath33 , where the leading feynman diagram for the self - energy @xmath34 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : feynman ] . only the one - magnon process is considered .",
    "this approximation can be questioned on the grounds of fallibility of the `` migdal approximation '' for electron - magnon processes @xcite .",
    "however , it is a proper first estimate , the only one which can be reliably computed , and seems to me unlikely to make a large error when @xmath35 .",
    "two magnon processes have been considered by lutovinov and reizer @xcite .",
    "the actual states @xmath36 of interest are surface states of spin * primarily * but not exclusively up . the probability @xmath37 ( or @xmath38 for short ) that the spin state is up , is less than one .",
    "the amplitude of the up - spin component of the wavefunction is @xmath39 and is close to 1 .",
    "the corresponding probability @xmath40 ( or @xmath41 for short ) that the spin state is down , is non - zero for two reasons .",
    "first , the spin - orbit interaction is not small and mixes spin states .",
    "second , @xmath42-spins on gd atoms may deviate from perfect alignment by quantum and thermal fluctuations , and the conduction states are locally locked by hund s rule in the same spin orientation as the @xmath42-spins .",
    "the second process is a renormalization of electron bands by magnon processes .",
    "a combination of the two effects is seen experimentally @xcite as a small minority spin component in the photoemitted electron .",

    "depletion of an excess population toward equilibrium occurs both by emission and absorption of thermal magnons . each process ( emission or absorption )",
    "has a time - reversed process which enhances the population , the `` scattering in '' terms with opposite sign . in thermal equilibrium , scattering out and in occur at equal rates .",
    "this `` principle of detailed balance '' guarantees that the two parts of @xmath66(emission ) cancel each other when the distributions @xmath54 and @xmath67 become the equilibrium distributions @xmath68 and @xmath42 , and similarly for @xmath66(absorption ) .",

    "( [ eq : tau ] ) are the experimental quasiparticle and magnon energies , which is mandated by the occurrence of the full , not bare , green s functions in the self - energy graph of fig .",
    "[ fig : feynman ] .",
    "reasonable simplifying assumptions yield a `` zero parameter '' estimate of eq .",
    "( [ eq : tau ] ) for @xmath32 .",
    "first , we specialize to a state @xmath36 which is in an occupied surface band .",
    "this state at low @xmath76 is dominantly spin up , but as seen experimentally , it has a spin down component , @xmath77 .",
    "the green s function @xmath78 and self - energy are @xmath79 matrices in spin space .",
    "eigenstates of the 2 @xmath80 2 matrix @xmath81 are the spin - split quasiparticles , of which only the lower ( primarily majority spin ) state is relevant .",
    "the energy of this state will be denoted @xmath82 , with no band or spin index needed , and only a two - dimensional wavevector @xmath83 rather than a three - dimensional @xmath84 .",
    "spin - resolved photoemission selectively depopulates a single spin component of this state .",
    "when the photoemitted electron has spin down , there is a hole in the down - spin component of the of the majority spin hole band .",
    "this component ( with distribution function @xmath85 ) decays to equilibrium with rate @xmath86 .",
    "we assume that @xmath87 is independent of @xmath83 , and similarly @xmath88",
    ". then we have @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the relevant density of decay channels . at @xmath91 , @xmath90 is @xmath92 we assume that the spin waves retain their bulk character .",
    "therefore , although electron energies depend only on the two - component @xmath83 , the spin - wave energy @xmath93 depends on all three components of wavevector , the @xmath74 direction being normal to the surface . the first delta function in eq .",
    "( [ eq : d1 ] ) is a process where an empty state @xmath94 lying above the fermi surface is filled from a state @xmath83 which scatters into it by spin - wave emission . in other words",
    ", it refers to decay of an electron lying in a state @xmath83 which is above the fermi energy by at least a spin - wave energy .",
    "the second delta function is a process where the filled state @xmath94 lying below the fermi surface scatters into an empty state @xmath83 by spin - wave emission ; in other words , it describes decay of a hole in the state @xmath83 ( below the fermi energy by at least a spin - wave energy . )",
    "it is only this second process which is seen in the photoemission data .",
    "let us also assume that the photohole state @xmath83 lies below the fermi energy by at least 25 mev , the maximum spin - wave energy , in which case @xmath95 is guaranteed to be 1 .",
    "the @xmath96 integration then gives @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the normalized spin - wave slope @xmath99 and @xmath100 is the number of spin - wave states @xmath101 with fixed @xmath102 , but any value of @xmath96 , which conserve energy , _",
    "i.e. _ which satisfy @xmath103 .",
    "examining the measured dispersion curves @xcite , the normalized slope can lie between 0 and a maximum which is not very different from @xmath104=25 mev . if @xmath105 is not greater than @xmath106",
    ", then there is a fairly good chance ( something like 50% probability ) that there are 2 values , @xmath107 , such that the spin - wave state @xmath101 obeys energy conservation . in other words",
    ", @xmath100 can be expected to take the value 2 or 0 with about equal probability provided @xmath108 , and is definitely 0 elsewhere .    the remaining integral is @xmath109 this integral should be evaluated using the correct dispersion relations for the surface electron state and for the spin - wave states , with allowance for boundary conditions and wave - function amplitudes altering the matrix elements . however",
    ", this requires a large `` first - principles '' calculation of uncertain reliability .",
    "therefore , a slightly cavalier estimate is in order .",
    "assume that the surface state has parabolic dispersion @xmath110 .",
    "experimentally this state is seen @xcite to disperse downwards in energy with effective mass @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the electron mass .",

    "we assume @xmath115 has an average value of 1 and the normalized slope has an average value @xmath116",
    ". then the density of decay channels is @xmath117 this is @xmath57-independent because of the 2-dimensionality of the surface band .",
    "a more careful treatment , yielding exactly the same result , is in the appendix .",
    "finally we evaluate the decay rate eq .",
    "( [ eq : tau1 ] ) by choosing @xmath29 to be the spin splitting of the surface state , @xmath118 ev @xcite , @xmath119 to be 7/2 , and the fractional up - spin probability @xmath120 @xcite .",
    "these assumptions yield @xmath121 ev for all photohole states @xmath83 which are not too much closer than 25 mev to the top of the surface state band . for states closer to the top",
    ", the decay rate should diminish because of reduction of the number of decay channels @xmath90 .",
    "it is also assumed that @xmath76 is fairly low . at higher @xmath76 ,",
    "the rate is enhanced by thermal spin - wave population , but diminished by diminishing fractional up - spin probability @xmath122 .",
    "the estimate @xmath121 ev agrees with experiment @xcite to greater precision than the uncertainties of the model .",
    "the calculation supports the interpretation that the source of minority spin line - broadening is spin - flip decay .        here",

    "( [ eq : d3 ] ) .",
    "finally it is appropriate to mention the hidden assumptions about surface and bulk states .",
    "it is implicitly assumed that the electron surface state has a wavefunction of unit amplitude on the surface layer and zero amplitude elsewhere .",
    "this kind of state will be absolutely insensitive to the @xmath74-component of the magnon wave - vector , and the electron - magnon matrix element will be @xmath161^{1/2}$ ] for all @xmath83 and @xmath145 .",
    "suppose instead a surface electron wavefunction of amplitude @xmath162 on each of the top two layers .",

    "conversely , a surface wavefunction which has amplitude @xmath56 on the top two layers , with a sign change , will couple only to the @xmath134 branch and not to the @xmath135 branch .",
    "it is not reasonable that the net coupling to magnons should depend much on the depth or details of the surface electron wavefunction ; therefore we should ask where has the missing magnon coupling gone when the electron wavefunction extends two layers down instead of one .",
    "the answer is in the orthogonal electron wavefunction on the top two layers , with opposite phase relation between layer 1 and 2 .",
    "since by assumption there is only one surface state , the orthogonal state is not an eigenstate but a superposition of bulk states .",
    "the missing magnon coupling is from the surface state into these bulk states . for the actual gd surface state ,",
    "how much of the magnon - induced scattering is to bulk and how much is to surface states is an unknown element .",
