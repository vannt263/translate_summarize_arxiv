    "the in - plane optical conductivity of as - grown and annealed bafe@xmath23co@xmath24as@xmath18 ( see methods ) are shown in fig .",
    "1*a * and 1*b * , respectively .",
    "after annealing we observe a decrease in the depth of the minimum around 70 mev separating the free - charge and interband optical conductivity .",
    "this arises from a reduction of a broad incoherent response associated with high energy interband processes , rather than from changes in the free - charge response@xcite .",
    "a spectral weight analysis@xcite for both crystals gives @xmath25 1.4 ev and a contribution of interband transitions to the low energy dielectric constant @xmath26 100 .",
    "these similarities indicate that annealing does not significantly change the overall electronic structure ( such as a chemical potential shift ) or high - energy optical properties .",
    "subtle changes in the free charge carrier response are more easily analysed in terms of equations ( [ edm ] ) and ( [ mfl ] ) , but the extended drude model analysis assumes that interband transitions do not contribute to the optical conductivity in the energy range of interest .",
    "the multi - band nature of the pnictides complicates the extraction of @xmath14 since inter - band processes have a significant contribution to the optical conductivity@xcite . in the supplementary material@xcite ( som )",
    "we describe the procedure used to extract the memory functions and its range of validity .",
    "we find that even though the determination of the memory functions comes with uncertainty at higher energies , at low energies ( @xmath27 50 mev ) interband transitions only weakly affect the frequency dependence . in the following we subtract the full frequency dependence of the interband response as outlined in the supplementary materials@xcite ; however , we note that our conclusions remain the same when alternative methods for accounting for the interband transitions are applied .    the frequency and temperature dependence of the imaginary part of the memory function @xmath28 , shown in fig .",
    "1*c * and 1*d * for the as - grown and annealed crystal , respectively , indicates the presence of residual interactions beyond a classical drude response .",
    "we fit both datasets with a power - law form @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the zero - frequency scattering rate and @xmath31 = 2 is expected for a fl .",
    "these parameters are determined independently at each temperature .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath30 and @xmath31 are displayed in fig .",
    "1*e , f * for both the as - grown and annealed crystal .",
    "we find that the annealed crystal displays characteristic fl behaviour with @xmath32 ( fig .",

    "1*f * ) over a large range of energy ( 10 mev @xmath34 50 mev ) and temperature ( 8 k @xmath35 100 k ) .",
    "we further find that the prefactor @xmath36 is temperature independent in the same temperature range as is expected from eq .",
    "( [ mfl ] ) ( see som@xcite ) .",
    "the as - grown crystal on the other hand does not display fl behaviour .",
    "instead , the zero frequency scattering rate follows a more linear temperature dependence , while the frequency exponent @xmath37 .",
    "given the approximate @xmath38 and @xmath39 dependence of the memory function apparent in fig .",
    "1*e , f * , we test whether the scaling form of eq .",
    "[ mfl ] applies to the annealed crystal .",
    "1*g * demonstrates that @xmath28 indeed follows a universal fl scaling as function of the scaling variable @xmath40 , with @xmath5 1.47 ( see som@xcite ) .",
    "we highlight three deviations from universal fl behaviour that can be discerned in fig .",
    "1*g*. first , universal fl behaviour disappears above 100 k. second , for @xmath41 2500 mev@xmath42 , @xmath43 changes slope , as indicated by the dashed pink line , signalling a crossover to a nearly energy independent @xmath28 for @xmath44 50 mev ( fig .",
    "third , @xmath6 = 1.47 rather than 2 , indicating that an additional elastic contribution is present beyond residual electron - electron scattering .",
    "we note that the precise value of @xmath6 determined by collapsing the data on a universal curve comes with some uncertainty as it depends on the assumed strength and frequency dependence of the interband contribution ( see som@xcite ) .",
    "our analysis provides compelling evidence that the normal state of bafe@xmath23co@xmath24as@xmath18 below 100 k is properly classified as a fl .",
    "we emphasise that the specific method of accounting for interband processes does not alter the conclusion that the low frequency and temperature dependence of @xmath28 follows @xmath39 and @xmath38 scaling@xcite .",
    "in contrast , the same analysis applied to the as - grown crystal does not show such clear signatures of fl behaviour , despite its similar plasma frequency and high - energy optical properties .",
    "nevertheless , the determination of the parameters characterising the fermi liquid state using the extended drude analysis remains sensitive to the choice for the interband contribution . to fortify our conclusions , and to determine the characteristic properties of the fermi liquid state more accurately",
    ", we now turn our attention to an analysis of the complex optical conductivity , which provides a more direct comparison between theory and experiment and does not require a model specific choice for the interband processes .",
    "berthod _ et al .",
    "_ showed@xcite that in a local fl a dome is defined by the locus of points where @xmath45 , which bounds a thermal regime in which fl behaviour emerges .",
    "zero crossings signalling the presence of a dome have been clearly observed@xcite in sr@xmath18ruo@xmath19 at low temperatures . despite the clean fermi liquid behaviour , exemplified in that case by @xmath17",
    ", these authors found that at elevated temperatures deviations from the predicted dome shape appeared , which they linked to the increasing importance with increasing temperature of resilient quasi - particles .",
    "this observation provides the means to make a direct comparison between the optical conductivity and theoretical calculations , where one does not have to resort to making the decompositions involved in the extended drude analysis presented in fig . 1 .",
    "to facilitate a direct comparison between experiment and theory we introduce the function @xmath46 , which is readily obtained from experimental data and also from calculations of the optical conductivity . for the particular case of a local fl ,",
    "the function @xmath47 has the property that it is negative in the thermal regime where characteristic fl behaviour should be observed , while it is positive in the incoherent and drude - like regimes .",
    "moreover , the zeros of this function correspond to the  dome \" derived by berthod _",
    "et al._. @xmath47 thus allows us to examine the full , complex optical conductivity and search for zero - crossings where @xmath48 .    in fig .",
    "2*a * , @xmath47 is displayed as a false color plot for the annealed crystal . in fig .",
    "2*a * , blue represents @xmath49 , while red indicates @xmath50 .",
    "@xmath51 is indicated in white . the most striking feature of fig . 2*a",
    "* is a clear dome of zero crossings , closely resembling the dome predicted by berthod _",
    "et al._. in fig .",
    "2*b * we display calculations of @xmath47 , assuming a fl self - energy ( see methods and som@xcite for calculation details ) .",
    "motivated by the saturation of @xmath28 above 50 mev ( fig 1*d * ) , we have introduced a cutoff @xmath52 above which the imaginary part of the single particle self - energy , @xmath53 , is constant ( see fig . 3*a * and methods ) and a high energy cutoff @xmath54 .",
    "the calculated @xmath47 is in excellent agreement with the experimental data . as input for the calculation we have used several experimentally available parameters , namely @xmath25 1.4 ev , @xmath55 7 mev and @xmath5 1.47 .",
    "the cutoffs @xmath56 41 mev and @xmath57 1 ev are motivated below .",
    "in addition to the free charge response , we also include the frequency dependent interband response from supplementary table s1@xcite .",
    "the only remaining free parameter , @xmath7 1700 k , is determined by two criteria : ( i ) the maximum of the dome of zero crossings ( at @xmath58 55 mev ) and ( ii ) the low temperature zero - crossing at @xmath58 100 mev . to facilitate the estimation of @xmath59 ,",
    "we derive an approximate analytical expression , @xmath60 ( see methods and som@xcite ) , for these zero - crossings taking an energy independent interband response ( e.g. @xmath61 ) into account . the consistency between @xmath60 , the data , and the calculation ( which includes the full frequency dependence of the interband response ) shows that the details of the interband response are unimportant for obtaining this level of agreement .      the deviation from scaling in fig .",
    "1*e - g * around 100 k signals a crossover temperature where @xmath62 , above which an incoherent regime emerges@xcite .",
    "this suggests a natural cutoff @xmath63 1.47@xmath64 with @xmath65 100 k , resulting in @xmath56 41 mev .",
    "the cutoff @xmath57 1 ev is less critical but is motivated by the value of @xmath59 .",
    "dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) calculations for a single band hubbard model@xcite indicate that @xmath66 where @xmath67 is half the bandwidth and @xmath68 is the carrier density .",
    "this yields @xmath69 1.3 ev in our case , which is reasonable compared to combined density functional theory and dmft ( e.g lda+dmft ) estimates@xcite .",
    "apart from the saturation in @xmath53 , @xmath52 also introduces@xcite a frequency dependence in @xmath70 ( see fig .",
    "3*a * ) , which should be manifest as a frequency dependent mass enhancement @xmath71 in the free charge response .",
    "3*b * shows excellent agreement between @xmath72 extracted from experiment and the theoretical calculation where @xmath73 1.2 .",
    "this value is consistent with a modest @xmath74 1.8 predicted by lda+dmft calculations for this level of electron doping.@xcite the experimental data leaves some room for additional mass enhancement resulting from boson exchange processes ( such as phonons or spin - fluctuations ) below @xmath58 10 mev , although it is difficult to make a quantitative statement on their strength due to the low signal - to - noise at low energy .",
    "more importantly , the energy dependence of the mass - enhancement introduced through the cutoff in our self - energy rules out the presence of a significant boson exchange spectrum for @xmath44 10 mev .",
    "we emphasise that the calculated mass enhancement is based on an analysis of the optical conductivity , while the experimental mass enhancement is determined using the extended drude analysis presented in fig .",
    "1 . the excellent agreement between the experimental and calculated @xmath72 therefore serves as a confirmation of the analysis presented in fig . 1 .",
    "to conclude we discuss the deviation of @xmath6 from the fl value @xmath6 = 2 .",
    "the most likely origin appears to be scattering of quasi - particles on weak , localised magnetic moments@xcite .",
    "such localised moments could be associated with the presence of co impurities in the fe lattice , although no local moment has been detected for co impurities in bafe@xmath18as@xmath18@xcite .",
    "regardless the origin , this resonant elastic term has a strong influence on the normal state properties .",
    "figure 3c displays @xmath47 for the as - grown crystal , displaying a suppressed dome of zero - crossings compared to the annealed crystal .",
    "the dashed semi - circle is calculated using exactly the same parameters as for the annealed case , except for a slightly higher @xmath75 8 and @xmath6 = 1.34 .",
    "this smaller value of @xmath6 corresponds to a two - fold stronger elastic term in the single particle self - energy @xmath9 , indicating that annealing strongly reduces the influence of this scattering channel .",
    "given the concomitant change in superconducting critical temperature , we suggest that this scattering channel could be pair - breaking , possibly providing an interesting direction for future work .",
    "a large 4 x 5 x 0.1 mm@xmath76 single crystal of bafe@xmath23co@xmath24as@xmath18 , grown from self - flux , was cut into two pieces and one piece was subsequently annealed for 75 hours at 800 @xmath77c .",
    "the dc resistivity and dc susceptibility show an increase of the critical temperature @xmath78 0.3 upon annealing , while the overall value of the resistivity decreases .",

    "the full temperature dependence was measured by collecting 1 spectrum per minute while cooling down with a constant rate of 1.5 k per minute , followed by a similar warming measurement . by combining both warming and cooling measurements we thus obtained 1 spectrum every 2 k. by comparing ratios of ag and al spectra to published literature results we obtained standardized reference spectra as function of temperature used to determine the reflectivity in the entire measured frequency range .",
    "silver turned out to be particularly useful in the photon range around 1.2 ev where al has a weakly temperature dependent interband transition .",
    "the resulting reflectivity is shown in figure [ s2 ] for selected temperatures .",
    "for the as - grown crystal we observe the opening of the superconducting gap below 18 k as can be seen in panel [ s2]c . the somewhat smaller crystal size ( 2 x 1 x 0.1 mm@xmath76 ) for the annealed crystal complicated the accurate determination of the reflectivity below 10 mev most likely due to diffraction effects becoming important at these longer wavelengths .",
    "figure [ s2]e compares the low frequency reflectivity of the annealed and as - grown crystals . based on the higher reflectivity of the annealed crystal one can immediately observe that the overall scattering rate has decreased , assuming that the charge carrier concentration has not significantly changed . in a first step the reflectivity data is modelled using a drude - lorentz model with parameters optimized by a least - square levenberg - marquardt routine @xcite .",

    "we find that the intraband contribution can be described by two relatively narrow drude terms and a low energy lorentz oscillator .",

    "oscillator decreases , resulting in a much weaker contribution at low energy .",

    "as discussed in the main text , overlapping intra- and interband conductivities complicate the extraction of the memory function from optical conductivity data . in the absence of overlapping intra- and interband conductivities ( e.g. such as is the case for cuprate htsc ) one can write the memory function in terms of the dielectric function : @xmath104^{2}+\\varepsilon_{2}^{2}(\\omega)}\\\\ m_{2}(\\omega)=\\frac{\\omega^{2}_{p}}{\\omega}\\frac{\\varepsilon_{\\infty , ir}-\\varepsilon_{1}(\\omega)}{[\\varepsilon_{\\infty , ir}-\\varepsilon_{1}(\\omega)]^{2}+\\varepsilon_{2}^{2}(\\omega ) } -\\omega\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath83 represents a frequency independent contribution to the _ real part _ of the dielectric function due to high energy interband transitions , which can be estimated from the oscillator strengths of those transitions .",
    "what happens in the case of iron - pnictides where interband transitions have a low energy onset ( estimated to be situated around 100 mev , see fig .",
    "[ s3 ] ) ? this is most clearly illustrated in figure [ s5 ] where we show the free charge ( or intraband ) and bound charge ( or interband ) contributions to the dielectric model presented in table [ dltable ] .",
    "the question that arises is whether the bound charge response can be approximated with a constant in the photon energy range where we want to analyze the memory function . given the relative strengths of the free and bound charge response , the approximation of using a frequency independent @xmath83 could possibly be upheld below about 50 mev .",
    "this is fortified by explicitly calculating the imaginary part of the memory function for a series of models as we will now discuss .",

    "the 2 drude case ( in green ) would represent the correct optical scattering rate that we would like to extract in an experiment .",
    "the other cases show deviations from this ideal curve to varying degrees .",
    "what is important for the current work is that below about 50 - 80 mev the frequency dependence in all cases is very close to the ideal case indicating that in the realistic case relevant to the iron - pnictides ( black curve ) the extended drude model gives relevant results in the photon energy range discussed in the main text .",
    "to test the robustness of the results presented in the main text we used two methods to determine the memory function . in the first method we approximated the interband contribution with a temperature independent @xmath105 100 - 105 ( for as - grown and annealed crystals respectively )",
