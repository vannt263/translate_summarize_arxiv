    "neutrino physics , in particular its experimental part , has been extremely successful in the last 10 years .",
    "it would be worthwhile to look it back on this occasion as a prologue to our discussion on the future . in",
    "1998 the super - kamiokande atmospheric neutrino observation confirmed @xcite the smoking gun evidence for atmospheric neutrino anomaly seen in the deficit of the rate and in the zenith angle distribution of @xmath2 induced events in the kamiokande experiment @xcite .",
    "it was the first evidence for mass - induced neutrino oscillation .",
    "oscillation in close analogy to @xmath3 oscillation @xcite . in 1962",
    "maki , nakagawa , and sakata @xcite first pointed out the possibility of neutrino flavor transformation , the phenomenon established experimentally only recently as described here . ] the evidence for neutrino oscillation was readily confirmed by the first long - baseline ( lbl ) accelerator neutrino experiment k2k @xcite using man - made @xmath2 beam . in this sense , the first corner stone was placed in the 2 - 3 sector of the lepton flavor mixing matrix , the mns matrix @xcite .",
    "it established surprisingly that the mixing angle @xmath1 is large , which may even close to the maximal , refuting the prejudice of small flavor mixing angles deeply rooted among theorists at that time .    on the other hand ,",
    "there have been great amount of efforts in the solar neutrino observation pioneered by davis with his @xmath4cl experiment in sixties which was developed in close collaboration with the devoted theorist @xcite . in the last 20 years",
    "the field has been enriched by participation by kamiokande , ga , super - kamiokande , and sno experiments @xcite .",
    "in particular , the latter two experiments were united to the confirm the particle physics nature of the solar neutrino problem , the evidence for solar neutrino flavor transformation @xcite .",
    "later sno _ in situ _ confirmed the evidence @xcite .",
    "i would like to note here that the deficit of the @xmath5b flux obtained by davis in his @xmath4cl experiment @xcite , though suffered from stubborn skepticism for more than 30 years , was convincingly confirmed by the sno charged current ( cc ) measurement .",
    "the beautiful finale of the solar neutrino problem came with kamland @xcite which identified its cause as due to the mass - induced neutrino oscillation which clearly pinned down the large mixing angle ( lma ) msw solar neutrino solution @xcite .",
    "the particular significance of the kamland result in this context , so called the kamland massacre ( of non - standard scenarios ) , was emphasized by many people with detailed analysis for example in @xcite .",
    "the resultant mixing angle @xmath6 turned out to be large , but not maximal .",
    "finally , several experiments , super - kamiokande @xcite , kamland @xcite , k2k @xcite , and minos @xcite , observed the oscillatory behavior , thereby established the phenomenon of mass - induced neutrino oscillation . at this moment",
    ", it constitutes the first and the unique evidence for physics beyond the standard model .    what is the next ?",
    "the most common answer , which i also share , is to explore the unknown 1 - 3 sector , for which the only knowledge we have is the upper bound on @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "discovery of leptonic cp violation must throw light on tantalizing mystery of interrelationship between quarks and leptons .",
    "the discussion of the quark - lepton correspondence which can be traced to early sixties @xcite , and in a modern context presented in a compelling form with the anomaly cancellation in standard model @xcite strongly suggests that they have common roots .",
    "it is also possible that the kobayashi - maskawa type cp violation @xcite in the lepton sector might be related to cp violation at high energies which is required for leptogenesis @xcite to work .",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite and the references cited therein for this point .    despite the great progress in our understanding mentioned above",
    "we do have many important unanswered questions .",
    "the list includes , for example , the followings : what is the origin of neutrino masses and mixing ?",
    "what is the reason for disparity between small quark and large lepton mixings ?",
    "is there underlying quark - lepton symmetry , or quark - lepton complementarity ? is there flavor symmetry which includes quarks and leptons ?",
    "i am sure that many more questions exist .",
    "these points are discussed in depth in a recent review @xcite .",
    "the new stage of neutrino physics may also be characterized as beginning of the era of precision measurement of lepton mixing parameters . testing the various theoretical ideas proposed to understand the uncovered structure mentioned above requires accurate determination of mixing parameters .",
    "for example , to test the quark - lepton complementarity @xcite experimentally , one needs to improve accuracies for @xmath6 determination from the current one , @xmath7% for @xmath8 , to the one comparable to the cabibbo angle , @xmath9% @xcite",
    ". it will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ proceed ] .",
    "i must admit that the scope of my discussions is quite limited ; the crucially important issues such as absolute neutrino mass , nature of neutrinos ( majorana vs. dirac ) , majorana cp violation and leptogenesis are not covered .",
    "moreover , it covers only a part of the things that should be addressed for exploring unknowns done by the future lbl experiments , that is , concrete ways of how to determine the mixing parameters with the next generation conventional @xmath2 superbeam @xcite and reactor experiments .",
    "yet , conventional superbeam experiments are extremely interesting because , in principle , they can be done in the next 10 - 15 years without long - term r@xmath10d effort .",
    "here is a composition of this long report .",
    "first of all , i intend to be pedagogical in writing this report ; i met with many brilliant young people in `` world summit in galapagos '' @xcite , and a broad class of audiences who keenly interested in neutrino physics in `` heavy quarks and leptons '' @xcite , and it is a pity if this manuscript is entirely unreadable to them . in sec .",

    "these numbers are cross checked in various occasions @xcite .",

    "[ pdege ] ) to achieve the goal of precision determination of the lepton mixing parameters .",
    "to reach the goal of seeing leptonic cp violation , we have to clear the first hurdle , knowing the value of @xmath0 . what is the most appropriate way to measure the parameter ? to answer the question we consider the neutrino oscillation channel which involve @xmath26 , otherwise @xmath0 would not be contained in leading order .",
    "there are two candidate channels ; @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( or , @xmath29 ) . in our discussion",
    "that follows , @xmath30 is the same as @xmath29 .",
    "we note that @xmath31 probed at energy / baseline appropriate to atmospheric @xmath32 scale consists of interference terms between amplitudes @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",

    ", the oscillation probability contains interference terms between amplitudes @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "then , the appearance channel looks to be advantageous because only a single power of @xmath38 is involved .",

    "( [ pmue ] ) is the solar scale oscillation term , which will be important for resolving the @xmath1 degeneracy .",
    "it was proposed @xcite that by using identical near and far detectors which is placed close to and at around @xmath551 km from the reactor , respectively , one can search for non - zero @xmath0 to a region of @xmath56 .",

    "intensive efforts over several years from these proposals entailed the various projects in world wide as described in @xcite . by",
    "now a few projects have already been approved , or are close to the status @xcite .",
    "scientific merit of the reactor measurement of @xmath0 is that it provides pure measurement of @xmath0 without being affected by other mixing parameters , as emphasized in @xcite .",

    "it is known that @xmath26 ( @xmath41 ) disappearance probability has no sensitivity to @xmath57 even in matter with arbitrary profile with negligible higher order correction @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that reactor @xmath0 experiment can be combined with accelerator appearance measurement to uncover cp violation @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the reactor experiments accelerator measurement of @xmath0 is `` contaminated '' ( or enriched ) by the other mixing parameters , in particular by @xmath57 in the case of low energy superbeam experiments .",
    "the sensitivity to @xmath0 therefore depends upon @xmath57 in a significant way .",
    "though it sounds like drawback of the accelerator method , it in turn means that the lbl @xmath0 experiments can be upgraded to search for leptonic cp violation .",
    "( this is why and how the low - energy superbeam was originally motivated in @xcite . ) there exist an approved experiment t2k @xcite using the 0.75 mw neutrino beam from j - parc , and a competitive proposal of no@xmath25a @xcite which uses numi beam line in fermilab .",
    "the sensitivity to @xmath0 , is roughly speaking , up to @xmath56 .",

    "to proceed further , we need some knowledges on neutrino oscillation in matter",
    ". there are several ways to simply understand the matter effect in neutrino oscillations .",
    "one is to use perturbative approach @xcite .",
    "the other is to rely on cervera _ et al . _ formula @xcite which applies to higher matter densities .",
    "the most important reason why we want to understand the feature of vacuum - matter interplay in neutrino oscillation is that they tend to mix and confuse with each other . for the early references which took into account the matter effect which inevitably comes in into lbl cp violation search , see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "probably , the simplest way to understand the matter effect as well as cp phase effect is to rely on the cp trajectory diagram in @xmath40 and @xmath59 space , for short , the bi - probability plot @xcite .",

    "the distance from the origin to the ellipse complex represents @xmath60 .",
    "we mention that the bi - probability plot can be extended to the one which includes t violation in which the charming relations between probabilities called the cp - cp and the t - cp relations are hidden @xcite .",

    "when people started to think about the possibility of observing cp violation there were two alternative ways to approach the goal , high - energy vs. low - energy options , as described in @xcite .",
    "the high - energy option , the majority at that time , is based on the idea of neutrino factory @xcite which utilizes intense neutrino beam from muon storage ring .",
    "because background can be suppressed to a very small level due to clean detection of high - energy muons , the sensitivity to @xmath0 and @xmath57 can be extremely good .",
    "we do not quote the number here because its re - examination by taking into account the possibility of lowering the threshold is ongoing in the context of neutrino factory international scoping study @xcite , which should be available soon .",
    "the low - energy option is based on very simple fact that the effect of cp phase @xmath57 is large at low energies @xcite .",
    "what is good in the low - energy option is that it can be realized with conventional @xmath2 superbeam .",
    "it opens the possibility that the cp violation search can be pursued by relying on known beam technology with no need of an extensive r@xmath10d efforts , and is doable in the next 10 - 15 years if we can enjoy generous governmental support . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath26 appearance search with conventional @xmath2 beam inevitably has the intrinsic problem of background , not only of the beam origin but also due to the neutral current ( nc ) @xmath62 in the case of water cherenkov detectors . despite the potential difficulties , the possibility of experimental search for leptonic cp violation became the realistic option when",
    "loi of the t2k experiment with optimistic conclusion was submitted @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the optimism in the early era was challenged by several potential obstacles .",
    "first of all , reducing the systematic error to a required level , a few % level , is a tremendous task .",
    "news is that several experiments are going on , or to be done , to measure hadron production @xcite and neutrino nucleus interaction cross sections @xcite .",
    "other difficulties include , for example : the possibility that cp violation could be masked by the unknown sign of @xmath12 , or in more general context the presence of parameter degeneracy @xcite which can obscure the cp violation , which will be the topics of the next section .",
    "since sometime ago people recognized that measurement of @xmath40 and @xmath59 at a particular energy , no matter how accurate they are , allows multiple solutions of @xmath0 and @xmath57 , the problem of parameter degeneracy .",
    "the nature of the degeneracy can be understood as the intrinsic degeneracy @xcite , which is duplicated by the unknown sign of @xmath32 @xcite , and the possible octant ambiguity of @xmath1 @xcite if it is not maximal . for an overview of the resultant eight - fold parameter degeneracy , see e.g. , @xcite .",

    "next , we examine the inverse problem ; does the determination of mass hierarchy decouple from resolution of the @xmath1 degeneracy ?",

    "<S> i try to give an overview of future prospects of the experimental exploration of the unknowns in the neutrino mass pattern and the lepton flavor mixing . because of the nature of the lectures on which this manuscript is based , </S>",
    "<S> i give some pedagogical discussions to prepare for the presentation in the later part . </S>",
    "<S> i start from measuring @xmath0 by reactors and accelerators as a prerequisite for proceeding to search for leptonic cp violation . </S>",
    "<S> i then discuss how cp violation can be uncovered , and how the neutrino mass hierarchy can be determined . </S>",
    "<S> i do these by resolving so called the `` parameter degeneracy '' which is necessary anyway if one wants to seek precision measurement of the lepton mixing parameters . as a concrete setting for resolving the degeneracy </S>",
    "<S> i introduce the tokai - to - kamioka - korea two detector complex which receives neutrino superbeam from j - parc , sometimes dubbed as `` t2kk '' . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that t2kk is able to resolve all the eight - fold parameter degeneracy in a wide range of the lepton mixing parameters . </S>",
    "<S> i also discuss an alternative way for lifting the @xmath1 octant degeneracy by reactor - accelerator combined method . finally , i discuss by taking some examples how some theoretically or phenomenologically motivated ideas can be tested experimentally .    </S>",
