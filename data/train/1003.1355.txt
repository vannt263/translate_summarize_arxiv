    "@xcite have studied the wiggles of the dg tau microjet , hh 47 , and the serpens radio continuum jet .",
    "similarly , @xcite have studied the wiggle of the hh 30 jet . in both cases , assuming that the wiggles of those jets are due to an orbital motion of the jet sources , they have derived orbital parameters and masses that are reasonable for pre - main - sequence binaries . for those jets ,",
    "however , only one side of the jets is seen , and thus we can not confirm if the wiggles are really reflection - symmetric .",
    "this paper is a follow - up study of the hh 211 jet with our previous observations at unprecedented resolution up to @xmath0 ( lee et al .",
    "2009 , hereafter @xcite ) , obtained with the submillimeter array @xcite .",
    "the jet is clearly seen in sio ( ) on both sides of a young class 0 source with more than one cycle of wiggle , and is thus one of the best candidates to study the origin of the wiggle .",
    "the wiggle is reflection - symmetric and it seems to be due to an orbital motion of the jet source @xcite .",
    "the wiggle was called the c - shaped bending in @xcite but not here anymore because more than one cycle is seen . in order to have a more complete picture of the wiggle , here we also present co ( ) and so ( ) emissions of the jet in the same observations as already described in @xcite . by modeling the wiggle , we derive the orbital parameters and then discuss the nature of the source .",

    "this suggests that the innermost pair of co knots and the sub - knots of bk1 and rk1 are all the internal shocks produced by the same mechanism , namely by a periodical variation in the jet velocity as suggested in @xcite .    the knots bk2 and bk3 are better resolved , allowing us to study the detailed kinematics in different emissions in the internal shocks .",

    "in addition , the binary separation would be @xmath66 4.6 au , also consistent with that found in those binaries @xcite , which have a range of separation between 030 au .",
    "therefore , smm1 itself could indeed be a very low - mass protobinary because of the fragmentation at the beginning of star formation ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is unclear , however , why the jet source , with only @xmath0 30 , can have such an energetic collimated jet , but the companion as massive as the jet source does not have a jet or an outflow .",
    "it is also unclear if this protobinary will remain substellar in the final stage since it is surrounded by a compact envelope with an estimated mass of @xmath0 50 ( although it is a lower limit , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at the eastern edge of the ammonia envelope @xcite ? also ,",
    "since the source smm1 could form a triple system with the source smm2 detected at @xmath0 84 au to the southwest with a planetary mass @xcite , could the source smm2 be ejected from the smm1 binary system in the early stage of star formation because of dynamical decay @xcite ?",
    "the hh211 , if indeed a triple system consisting of a close binary ( @xmath6730 au ) with a third component at @xmath0 100 au , would be quite similar to those found in upper scorpius by @xcite .      here",
    "we estimate the mass - loss rate of the jet and the accretion rate toward the central source , in order to compare their ratio with that predicted in the current jet launching models .",

    "the mechanical luminosity of the jet is then @xmath74 roughly the same as the bolometric luminosity of the source , which is @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "the jet is likely powered by accretion as in the current jet launching models ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and our result suggests that the jet can indeed carry away a large fraction of the accretion power in the early phase of star formation as pointed out by @xcite .",
    "therefore , the accretion rate should be estimated using both the bolometric luminosity of the source and the mechanical luminosity of the jet . assuming that the source smm1 is a single protostar with a stellar mass of @xmath76 @xcite and a stellar radius of @xmath77 @xcite , then the accretion rate is @xmath78 .",
    "thus , the mass - loss rate is estimated to be @xmath0 20% of the accretion rate , consistent with that predicted in the current mhd models @xcite .",
    "however , the source smm1 itself could be a binary ( see  [ dis : binary ] ) . if the jet source has a mass of @xmath0 30 and it is responsible for half of the bolometric luminosity , then the accretion rate toward the jet source is @xmath79 . in this case , the mass - loss rate is @xmath0 14% of the accretion rate , also consistent with that derived simply from the law of energy conservation and the jet s angular momentum reported in @xcite ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "further observations are really needed to constrain our estimation .",
    "now let us check if the accretion rate is acceptable by comparing the accretion time with the outflow dynamical time . if the accretion rate was the same in the past , the accretion time would be @xmath80 , i.e. , @xmath0 7000 yrs if the source is single , or @xmath0 2300 yrs if the source is a binary .",
    "the outflow dynamical time can be estimated with the tip of the eastern outflow lobe in h@xmath8 @xcite because the bright h@xmath8 emission there requires the shock velocity there to be @xmath14 55 , otherwise h@xmath8 there will be all dissociated @xcite .",
    "therefore , with the tip at @xmath0 12500 au from the source , the dynamical time for the outflow is @xmath10 1100 yrs . as a result ,",
    "the accretion time is not shorter than the outflow dynamical time , and thus the accretion rate is acceptable .",
    "the accretion rate is high probably because of the extremely young age of the source smm1 .",
    "note that , if the source smm1 is a binary , then in our estimation the accretion time is only two times the outflow dynamical time .",
    "if that is the case , the jet could be launched soon after the accretion started .",
    "the abundances of sio and so in the gas phase are found to be highly enhanced in the jet as compared to the quiescent molecular clouds , even close to within 300 au from the source where the dynamical time scale is @xmath1 yrs .",
    "here we discuss the possible origins of the abundance enhancement of these molecules .",
    "although sio abundance enhancement has been found in many class 0 jets , its origin is still not well determined . in hh 211 , the abundance enhancement of sio",
    "is closely related to the shocks , with the emission associated with a broad range of velocities . as pointed out by schilke et al .",
    "( 1997 ) in their early work , the shocks are likely required to generate the sio gas by either ( 1 ) a release of sio from dust grains , or ( 2 ) a release of si atoms followed by conversion to sio through gas - phase chemistry .",
    "the jet indeed seems to be dusty , with the 352 ghz continuum emission extending along the jet axis from the source @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite have studied the formation time of the sio from si via gas - phase reactions in stationary c - type shocks with grain sputtering of si - bearing material for the preshock number density of hydrogen nuclei @xmath81 . from their results , if the shock velocity is greater than 30 , we can approximate the sio formation time to be roughly given by @xmath82 yrs .",
    "if we extrapolate that sio formation time for hh 211 that has @xmath83 ( see  [ sec : densities ] for @xmath84 ) , then the formation time is @xmath14 2 yrs for hh 211 , short enough to produce the sio emission in the sio knots .",
    "note that non - stationary c - type shocks @xcite and j - type shocks with more sophisticated grain processes @xcite could also be responsible for the sio emission and more studies are needed to explore those possibilities .",
    "there is a lack of sio emission [ not only in j=8 - 7 transition , but also in lower transitions in j=5 - 4 ( gueth et al . in prep ) and j=1 - 0 @xcite ] at the base of the jet in the innermost pair of co knots , bk0 and rk0 .",
    "this lack of sio emission is unlikely due to a lack of material because the jet is expected to have the same density along the jet axis except near the launching point where the density is much higher @xcite .",
    "this lack of sio emission suggests that the sio is not abundant there in the gas phase .",
    "if the sio were there abundant in the gas phase , the shocks that excite the co emission ( which was also detected in higher transition in the far infrared by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) would also excite the sio emission .",
    "so abundance enhancement has also been seen toward other class 0 sources , e.g. , l1448 , hh 212 , and l1157 , because of shocks . in l1157 ,",
    "the so emission is seen in the prominent bow shocks at @xmath10 20000 au away from the source , but no jetlike so emission is seen around the source @xcite . in l1448 , the so emission is seen at shock - precursor and post - shock velocities @xcite . in hh 212 , the so emission at the base is jetlike as in hh 211 and it extends to @xmath0 800 au from the source @xcite .",
    "note that in that source so emission in lower transition has also been detected upto 8000 au to the south along the jet @xcite .",
    "thus , the abundance of so in the jet seems to decrease from the younger sources , e.g. , hh 211 and hh 212 , to the older sources , e.g , l1157 ( which shows no clear jetlike so emission ) , like that of sio @xcite . in l1157",
    ", it was proposed that sulfur is released from dust grains in the form of h@xmath8s in the shocks and that is then oxidized to so @xcite . in l1448 , h@xmath8s emission is present in the shock - precursor , but is missing in the post - shock gas .",
    "@xcite considered oxidation of h@xmath8s to so in shock , but judged the timescale [ 100  1000 yrs suggested by @xcite ] too long .",
    "they thus proposed that the so molecules might be abundant on dust grains and directly released from grains in the shocks . hh 211 and hh 212 could have the same origin of abundance enhancement in so . in hh 211 , the shocks can release sulfur from grains in the form of e.g. , h@xmath8s , and then oxidize it to so , as proposed in l1157 . if the jet is rich in atomic oxygen ( oi ) and carbon ion ( cii ) , then oxidation of h@xmath8s to",
    "so could take only a few years .",
    "for example , the following sequence would have timescales less than 5 yrs in a shock environment with @xmath85 , @xmath86 k , @xmath84(hi)/@xmath84(h@xmath8 ) @xmath0 0.01 , and @xmath84(oi)/@xmath87 @xmath88 : h@xmath8s + h @xmath89 hs + h@xmath8 ; hs + o @xmath89 so + h. in this example , the rate coefficients are 2.5@xmath90 s@xmath91 and 1.3@xmath92 s@xmath91 ( rate06 by * ? ? ? * ) , and the conversion timescales for h@xmath8s @xmath89 hs and hs @xmath89 so are 0.13 yrs and 3 yrs , respectively .",
    "( the timescale for hs + h @xmath89 s + h@xmath8 is 0.13 yrs , but the timescale for reverse s + h@xmath8 @xmath89 hs + h is 2.6 yrs at 1000 k. thus , about 5 percent of sulfur atoms will be in hs in 3 yrs and be available for hs + o. ) again , there is a lack of so emission at the base of the jet in the innermost pair of co knots .",
    "this suggests that the so is not abundant there , neither in the gas phase nor on the dust grains .",
    "if the so were there on the dust grains , it would evaporate into the gas phase and then be excited to produce the so emission .",
    "we now speculate what could cause the lack of sio and so abundances in the gas phase at the base of the jet in the innermost pair of co knots .",
    "since the mass - loss rate in the jet is high ( @xmath0 @xmath93 ) , sio and co as well could have formed via gas - phase reactions in an initially atomic jet close to the launching point ( @xmath67 0.1 au ) @xcite .",
    "if that is the case , the lack of gas - phase sio in the innermost pair of co knots suggests that the sio could be afterward dissociated e.g. , by the possible presence of a far - uv radiation field near the source .",
    "however , it is also possible that the sio is rapidly depleted onto the grains or converted to sio@xmath8 @xcite if the temperature of the jet indeed drops rapidly with the distance from the launching point as predicted by @xcite .",
    "in addition , the lack of gas - phase so in the innermost pair of co knots also suggests that the so , if formed at the base , is afterward destroyed . on the other hand , the co could stay in the gas phase , giving rise to the co emission even in the innermost pair of co knots .",
    "both the sio and so in the gas phase can form again in the shocks , as discussed above , producing the sio and so in the downstream .",
    "the so and sio abundances in the jet are seen decreasing with the outflow dynamical age , probably because the mass - loss rate decreases with time and so does the formation rate of the sio and so molecules .",
    "sio , co , and so can all be a good tracer of the hh 211 jet , tracing the internal shocks in the jet .",
    "although the sio , co , and so emissions show roughly the same morphology of the jet , there are detailed differences . in particular , the co emission traces the jet closer to the source than the sio and so emissions .",
    "in addition , in the better resolved internal shocks , the co emission is seen slightly ahead of the sio emission , likely because the sio emission traces stronger shocks closer to the shock front and the co emission traces the weaker shocks in the downstream . in the internal shock where the so",
    "emission is bright , the so emission appears slightly ahead of the sio emission , tracing weaker shocks than the sio emission .",
    "the jet is seen with more than one cycle of wiggle on both sides of the source smm1 in sio , co , and so .",
    "the wiggle is reflection - symmetric about the source and can be reasonably fitted by an orbiting source jet model .",
    "the best - fit parameters suggest that the source itself could be a very low - mass protobinary with a total mass of @xmath0 60 .",
    "the protobinary may have two equal - mass sources and a binary separation of @xmath0 4.6 au , in good agreement with those found in the binaries of very low - mass stars and brown dwarfs .",
    "the abundances of sio and so in the gas phase are found to be highly enhanced in the jet as compared to the quiescent molecular clouds , even close to within 300 au from the source where the dynamical time scale is @xmath1 yrs .",
    "the abundance enhancements of these molecules are closely related to the internal shocks in the jet .",
    "the detected sio is either the consequence of the release of si - bearing material from dust grains or of its formation via gas chemistry in the shocks .",
    "the so , on the other hand , seems to form via gas chemistry in the shocks .",

    "<S> hh 211 is a highly collimated jet originating from a nearby young class 0 protostar . </S>",
    "<S> here is a follow - up study of the jet with our previous observations at unprecedented resolution up to @xmath0 in sio ( ) , co ( ) , and so ( ) . </S>",
    "<S> sio , co , and so can all be a good tracer of the hh 211 jet , tracing the internal shocks in the jet . </S>",
    "<S> although the emissions of these molecules show roughly the same morphology of the jet , there are detailed differences . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the co emission traces the jet closer to the source than the sio and so emissions . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , in the better resolved internal shocks , both the co and so emission are seen slightly ahead of the sio emission . the jet is clearly seen on both sides of the source with more than one cycle of wiggle . </S>",
    "<S> the wiggle is reflection - symmetric about the source and can be reasonably fitted by an orbiting source jet model . </S>",
    "<S> the best - fit parameters suggest that the source itself could be a very low - mass protobinary with a total mass of @xmath0 60 and a binary separation of @xmath0 4.6 au . </S>",
    "<S> the abundances of sio and so in the gas phase are found to be highly enhanced in the jet as compared to the quiescent molecular clouds , even close to within 300 au from the source where the dynamical time scale is @xmath1 yrs . </S>",
    "<S> the abundance enhancements of these molecules are closely related to the internal shocks . </S>",
    "<S> the detected sio is either the consequence of the release of si - bearing material from dust grains or of its formation via gas chemistry in the shocks . </S>",
    "<S> the so , on the other hand , seems to form via gas chemistry in the shocks . </S>"
