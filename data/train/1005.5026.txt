    "knowledge of the properties of dark matter halos is an important issue for our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution , and for unveiling the nature of dark matter .",
    "the halo of the milky way therefore is of highest interest , as it allows unique observational constraints to be obtained for testing theoretical models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "several observational campaigns ",
    "e.g. the sloan digital sky survey ( _ sdss _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the radial velocity experiment ( _ rave _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the sloan extension for galactic understanding and exploration ( _ segue _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* )  provide the tracers for studying halo properties , like the total mass of the halo and its extent .",
    "several studies in the past decade determined the halo mass from ever increasing samples of halo stars , globular clusters and/or satellite galaxies .",
    "however , it is in fact only a few objects at highest velocity that are affecting largely the mass estimates .",
    "while larger halo masses of about @xmath5@xmath4   were favoured earlier , lower masses of about half this value were derived more recently @xcite .",
    "the precise value determines , e.g. among others , whether satellite galaxies like the magellanic clouds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or hyper - velocity star candidates @xcite are on bound orbits , or not .",
    "most of the previous studies had to rely substantially on the _ distributions _ of radial velocities in their samples to derive their conclusions as full space motions for halo objects are unavailable in many cases at present .",
    "in such cases only four coordinates ( i.e. two position values , distance and radial velocity , rv ) of the 6d phase space are determined and the missing data ( the proper motion components ) are handled in a statistical approach .",
    "e.g. , radial velocities for more than 10,000 blue halo stars from the _ sdss _ were measured in the yet most extensive study by @xcite .",
    "the sample was composed of blue horizontal - branch , blue straggler , and main - sequence stars with effective temperatures roughly between 7,000 and 10,000k according to their colours . here , we focus on the fastest stars of the xue et al .",
    "sample in terms of _ negative _ line - of - sight velocity , indicating a _ bound _ orbit .",
    "for one of them we were able to measure a significant proper motion , which allowed a detailed 3d kinematic investigation when combined with a quantitative spectroscopic analysis that facilitated the determination of the star s distance .",

    "if ejected early after its formation , the star could have travelled @xmath08mpc during its lifetime , such that a final answer on this may be only obtained when full space motions of the nearby galaxies are known . ]",
    "population  ii horizontal branch star with a galactic rest - frame ( grf ) velocity of @xmath0700@xmath2  at its current position , making it the fastest halo object known .",
    "this allows a significant lower limit for the total halo mass of the galaxy to be set .",
    "the present work provides a glimpse to the detailed kinematic investigations feasible once the european space agency s gaia satellite mission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) becomes operational , at much higher precision .",
    "in a previous paper we already investigated the high - velocity tail of the @xcite sample and found a hyper - velocity candidate of spectral type a among the stars with highest _ positive _ radial velocities in the grf . here",
    "we study the most extreme stars approaching us , applying the same techniques .",
    "we selected all stars with grf velocities @xmath6  @xmath2  from the rv - based sample of @xcite and obtained 5 targets for which we attempted to measure proper motions .",
    "all available independent position measurements on schmidt plates ( apm - @xcite ; sss - @xcite ) were collected and combined with the _ sdss _ and other available positions ( cmc14  @xcite ; 2mass - @xcite ; ukidss - @xcite ) for a first linear proper motion fit .",
    "however , there were even more measurements of schmidt plates , from up to 14 different epochs in case of overlapping plates of the digitised sky surveys",
    ". fits images of 15 by 15 arcmin size were extracted from all available plates and eso midas tools were used to measure positions . for this purpose , we selected compact background galaxies around each target , identified from _ sdss _ , to transform the target positions on all the schmidt plates to the _ sdss _ system .",
    "the small fields allowed us to apply a simple model ( shift+rotation ) and to achieve a higher accuracy in our final proper motion fit for all our targets ( see e.g. fig .  [ fig_pmfit ] ) .",
    "we consider a positive detection if the proper motion errors @xmath7 of both components are below 3.0@xmath8  and if at least one of the components is significant ( above 3@xmath7 ) . for j1539 + 0239 ,",
    "the brightest of our five targets , we found a highly significant proper motion of @xmath910.6@xmath101.6@xmath8  and @xmath1110.0@xmath102.3@xmath8 , whereas for the other four fainter stars ( with @xmath12 magnitudes between 17 and 20 ) the proper motion was consistent with zero .",

    "[ theo_lines ] . the combination of a higher @xmath16 than typically found for populationii stars and the diminished line blocking because of the low metal content results in a hardened radiation field which , along with reduced thermalizing effects because of smaller collision rates in the low - density atmosphere , leads to pronounced nlte effects on many diagnostic lines .",
    "nlte strengthening is found for the doppler core of h@xmath23  in line with the behaviour in cool stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* )  , while the inner line wings are weakened .",
    "the higher balmer and paschen lines show much lower deviations from lte .",
    "our calculations predict the majority of the weak lines to be described well by the assumption of lte . on the other hand , many of the stronger metal lines , as e.g. of ci , oi , mgi / ii or feii  the diagnostic lines at the spectroscopic resolution achieved within the _ sdss _  show pronounced nlte strengthening . in order to reproduce the nlte equivalent widths of these particular lines , abundance corrections need to be applied of about 0.1dex ( mgii ) , 0.2dex ( mgi , feii ) , 0.5dex ( oi ) and 1.9dex ( ci ) in lte .",
    "note , however , that these line are close to saturation .",
    "lte computations with increased abundances can therefore not reproduce the nlte line depths at all , instead stronger line wings develop .",
    "abundance studies based on equivalent widths may therefore be misleading , as such differences remain unnoticed .",
    "an investigation at high spectral resolution would therefore be worthwhile in order to facilitate the nlte effects to be studied in detail .",
    "using the mass , effective temperature , gravity and extinction - corrected apparent magnitude we derive the distance following using the fluxes from the final model spectrum in analogy to previous work .",
    "the distance error is dominated by the gravity error .    applying the galactic potential of @xcite we calculated orbits and reconstructed the path of the star through the galactic halo with the program of @xcite .",
    "the distance of the galactic center from the sun was adopted to be 8.0kpc and the sun s motion with respect to the local standard of rest was taken from @xcite . as the rv is well known the error of the space motion is dominated by that of the distance , ruled by the gravity error , and those of the proper motion components .",
    "varying these three quantities within their respective errors we applied a monte - carlo procedure to derive the median grf velocity @xmath41 at the present location and the velocity distribution ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : veldistrib_j1539 ] ) and compare with the local escape velocity @xmath43 as calculated from the galactic potential of @xcite .",
    "a median grf velocity of 694@xmath2  ( with the velocity distribution ranging from @xmath44 to + 300@xmath2  around this value ) makes j1539 + 0239 the fastest halo star known , superseding .",
    "this value is above the local escape velocity of @xmath45@xmath2  in the potential of @xcite .",
    "this three component potential consists of a central bulge and a disk , which have a combined mass of @xmath46@xmath4 .",
    "the halo out to 100kpc is assumed to have a total mass of @xmath47@xmath4 .",
    "this total halo mass is insufficient to keep the star bound to the galaxy .",
    "j1539 + 0239 is located in the northern galactic hemisphere ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 ) , in the direction close to the sagittarius stream @xcite and in particular close to the globular clusters and , with its tidal tail @xcite . however , it is unlikely that j1539 + 0239 is related to either of those because of its distinct space motion and its position in the foreground .",
    "its position and kinematics also rule out a scenario of a _ recent _ acceleration by an interaction with the super - massive black hole in the galactic center , the principal mechanism for generating hyper - velocity stars @xcite .",
