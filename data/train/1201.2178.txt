    "dust emission represents approximately one third of the bolometric luminosity in normal spiral galaxies and dust acts to shape the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of galaxies by attenuating short wavelength emission and re - emitting at longer wavelengths .",
    "dust can also be used to trace the total gas content in galaxies , since dust and gas often coexist .",
    "an understanding of dust and its distribution are essential to reveal the underlying appearance of galaxies and the processes within ( draine 2003 ) .    until recently it has been difficult to map the distribution and amount of dust in galaxies because , for most galaxies , only shorter wavelength infrared data has been available ( _ i.e. _ @xmath5 @xmath6 160  @xmath2 m ) . without longer wavelengths ,",
    "only the warmer dust emission is measured and subsequently the dust mass is poorly constrained ( draine et al .",
    "2007 and galametz et al .  2011 ) . while some ground - based telescopes ( _ i.e. _ scuba on jcmt ; holland et al .  1999 and sharcii on the cso ; dowel et al .  2003 ) have provided measurements in the far - infrared ( 350 , 450 and 850  @xmath2 m ) allowing for more accurate dust sed fits ( _ e.g. _ dunne et al .",
    "2000 , dunne & eales 2000 and dale et al .  2007 ) , these images had low sensitivity due to background noise from the atmosphere .",
    "the _ herschel _ space observatory ( pilbratt et al .  2010 ) has allowed us to probe the colder dust component in galaxies using measurements at wavelengths spanning 70 to 500  @xmath2 m at high sensitivity and resolution . in comparison to the _ spitzer _ space telescope ( werner et al .",
    "2004 ) , which also operated at 70 and 160  @xmath2 m ( mips ; rieke et al .",
    "2004 ) , the point spread functions ( psfs ) are smaller , the sensitivity is higher and there are fewer latent image effects .    in this work",
    "we use _ herschel _ observations to make dust temperature and mass maps for m83 which is part of the very nearby galaxy survey ( vngs ; pi : c.  wilson ) . due to its proximity",
    "( 4.5 @xmath3 0.3 mpc ; thim et al .",
    "2003 ) , which allows for high spatial resolution , and its relatively face - on orientation ( inclination angle of 24@xmath7 ) , it makes an excellent candidate to study the spatial distribution of the dust mass and temperature .",
    "m83 is a starburst galaxy with a prominent bar , which is outlined by dust lanes .",
    "dynamical studies have shown that gas is funneled along the bar producing high rates of star formation at the centre ( knapen et al .",
    "m83 is rich in molecular gas with 13 per cent of the disk mass consisting of molecular gas ( lundgren et al .",
    "studies of the spiral arms have shown that tracers of the gas and star formation rate ( sfr ) are often offset from each other suggesting that the spiral arms dynamically induce star formation ( lord & kenney 1991 ) . however , the situation is complicated in that molecular clouds are also seen coincident with young star forming regions ( rand et al .",
    "studies of the mid - infrared emission , which traces the very small dust grains and pahs , have revealed a tight correlation with the radio continuum , which may suggest the anchoring of magnetic fields in the photoionizing shells of clouds ( vogler et al .",
    "the morphology of m83 and the fact that it has coverage at many other wavelengths allows for comparisons of the varying environments within the galaxy and comparisons of the dust distribution to tracers of the gas and sfr .",
    "we estimate the dust temperature and mass of m83 on angular scales of 36 arcsec ( 790 pc ) using 70  @xmath2 m and 160  @xmath2 m images from the photodetector array camera and spectrometer ( pacs ; poglitsch et al .",
    "2010 ) and the 250 , 350 , 500  @xmath2 m maps from the spectral and photometric imaging receiver ( spire ; griffin et al .",
    "we compare the spatial distribution of the dust temperature and mass with tracers of the atomic gas , molecular gas and star formation rate for different regions in the galaxy including the nucleus , bar and spiral arms . in ",
    "2 we describe how the infrared , gas and sfr images were rendered and processed .",
    "our derivation of the dust temperature and dust mass distributions through sed fitting on each pixel is described in  3 and compared to the distributions of molecular and total gas as well as the star formation rate surface density in  4 .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in  5 .",
    "we use pacs images that are processed using both hipe v5 and scanamorphos v8 ( roussel et al . , sub . ) and spire images processed with hipe and brigade ( smith et al . , in prep ) .",
    "details on how the images are processed can be found in bendo et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , the spire observer s manual and the pacs observer s manual .",
    "we briefly describe the steps here .",
    "the pacs images were corrected from the v5 photometric calibration files to v6 ( with corrective factors of 1.119 and 1.174 for the 70 and 160  @xmath2 m maps respectively ) and were converted to jy / sr from jy / pixel .",
    "the spire images are first converted to jy / pixel from jy / beam using the respective beam sizes ( 423 @xmath3 3 , 751 @xmath3 4 , 1587 @xmath3 9 arcsec@xmath8 , for the 250 , 350 and 500  @xmath2 m images respectively ) .",
    "the images were then converted to jy / sr .",
    "the spire images were multiplied by the following values to convert from monochromatic intensities of point sources to monochromatic extended sources , 0.9939/1.0113 , 0.9898/1.0060 and 0.9773/1.0065 for the 250 , 350 and 500  @xmath2 m maps respectively .",
    "table 1 lists the pixel sizes and fwhm of the psfs for both the pacs and spire images .",
    "sky subtractions for all five images were made by subtracting the median value of several off - galaxy apertures .",
    "[ all ] shows the five images in their native resolution , before convolution and deprojection .",
    "the images are all aligned and convolved to the 500  @xmath2 m images using kernels developed by aniano et al .",
    "( 2011 ) for pacs and spire .",
    "the final pixel size is 12 arcsec .",
    "however , in our quantitative analysis we use 36 arcsec pixels , which correspond to the fwhm of the 500  @xmath2 m map .",
    "we also deproject the images to a face - on orientation adopting the inclination and position angles from tilanus & allen ( 1993 ) ( see table 2 ) .",
    "the uncertainties for each image are a combination of the uncertainty image files , which are corrected for convolution and deprojection , sky background uncertainties and the calibration uncertainties ( 0.03 , 0.05 , 0.07 , 0.07 , 0.07 for the calibration uncertainties of the 70 , 160 , 250 , 350 and 500  @xmath2 m images respectively ) .    while multiband imaging photometer images from _ spitzer _ ( mips ; rieke et al .",
    "2004 ) are available for m83 at 70  @xmath2 m and 160  @xmath2 m , they suffer from latent image effects and saturation in the nucleus due to m83 s brightness ( see bendo et al .",
    "2011 for a discussion ) .",
    "thus , we choose not to include these images in our analysis .",
    ".characteristics of images [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we note in the bottom right panel fig .",
    "[ radgas ] that the temperature of the dust in the bar region right before the shoulder is much higher than average ( denoted by solid curve ) .",
    "this is likely due to increased sf due to orbit crowding in this region .",
    "the top right panel of fig .",
    "[ radgas ] shows how the value of @xmath9 varies with radius .",
    "@xmath9 is close to 2 over much of the disk , with higher values in the inner 1 kpc .",
    "[ gdr ] shows the radial variation of the gas - to - dust ratio ( gdr ) , which is derived using the total gas mass ( atomic and molecular ) divided by the dust mass . both the azimuthal average ( black solid line ) and the region within the standard deviation ( grey shaded area ) are shown . across m83",
    "we find a mean value of 84 @xmath3 4 ( standard deviation : 40 ) which is roughly the galactic value of 100 - 200 ( _ e.g. _  sodroski et al .",
    "the right vertical panel of fig .",
    "[ gdr ] shows the histogram of the gdr .",
    "only a few regions in the galaxy have high gdrs in contradiction with previous estimates for m83 ( devereux & young 1990 ) which did not probe the cold dust .    in the central regions ,",
    "the gdr attains much higher values ( over 200 ) .",
    "this may simply be due to higher metallicities in the inner regions .",
    "one would expect a higher gdr with increasing metallicity .",
    "it may also be due to the x@xmath10 factor which can often overestimate the molecular gas in the central regions of spiral galaxies including the milky way by a factor of 2 or more ( _ i.e. _ regan 2000 ) .",
    "the x@xmath10 factor has been shown to be anti - correlated with metallicity in several studies ( _ i.e. _  wilson 1995 , arimoto et al .",
    "1996 , boselli et al .  2002 and israel 2005 ) .",
    "a recent study by magrini et al .",
    "( 2011 ) has shown that using an x@xmath10 factor that varies with metallicity may have a large impact on the radial profile of the gdr .",
    "this is particularly true for the inner regions , where the molecular gas dominates .    in light of this",
    ", we re - calculate our estimate of molecular hydrogen using an x@xmath10 factor which varies with metallicity .",
    "israel ( 2000 ) has derived a relationship between the x@xmath10 factor and the oxygen abundance as :    @xmath11    we use the oxygen abundance gradients of bresolin et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , which are based on linear regression fits of the results of several strong - line studies in the outer regions of m83 and compiled studies of the inner region by bresolin & kennicutt ( 2002 ) and bresolin et al .",
    "the abundance ratio decreases linearly from 12 @xmath12 log o / h=8.77 in the centre to 12 @xmath12 log o / h=8.6 at 6 kpc .",
    "[ gdr ] shows the gdr using a variable x@xmath10 factor ( dashed line ) .",
    "one notes that the gdr in the inner regions are much reduced and there is now a slight trend towards an increasing gdr with radius .",
    "some of the values in the inner region are much lower ( @xmath1360 ) than the galactic value of 100 - 200",
    ". this may not be too surprising given that the metallicity of m83 is super - solar in the inner regions ( bresolin et al .",
    "2005 ) , which also implies higher dust masses and subsequently a lower gdr .",
    "this shows the sensitivity of the gdr to an x@xmath10 factor that varies with metallicity .",
    "the consistency of the gdr over much of the disk beyond the inner regions is in contradiction to several other studies of similarly nearby spiral galaxies .",
    "recent studies of m99 and m100 ( pohlen et al .",
    "2010 ) and ngc 2403 ( bendo et al .",
    "2010b ) have shown an increasing gdr with radius .",
    "muoz - mateo et al .",
    "( 2009 ) also showed that almost all galaxies in the sings sample showed radially increasing gdrs .",
    "however , there were two exceptions .",
    "ngc 3627 showed a decreasing gdr and ngc 2976 showed a fairly consistent gdr .",
    "the close proximity of m83 has allowed us to probe in detail the dust temperature and mass distribution using images from pacs and spire . with its prominent bar and spiral arms",
    "we have also been able to compare different environments and see the correspondence of the dust temperature and mass with tracers of the gas and sfr .",
    "we briefly summarize our findings :    * we find an anti - correlation between @xmath9 and temperature with a mean value of @xmath9 of 2.1 @xmath3 0.1 .",
    "however , it is possible this anti - correlation is an artifact of noise and line - of - sight temperature variations ( shetty et al .",
    "2009a and 2009b ) . a comparison of the dust temperature maps made using a constant @xmath9=2 and",
    "a variable @xmath9 shows that the most prominent differences are in the inner regions .",
    "the dust mass surface density maps are virtually identical and have the same total dust mass within the uncertainties ; * we find a total dust mass of 4.0 @xmath3 0.6 @xmath14 10@xmath15 m@xmath16 ; * we find that the dust temperature and mass surface density distributions are not spatially coincident . in particular , while the dust mass surface density correlates extremely well with the molecular gas and sfr , we find that the dust temperature peaks are offset . in the spiral arms",
    ", we find that the dust temperature peaks lie ahead of the dust mass surface density ( assuming a trailing spiral structure ) ; * the dust temperature is more strongly correlated with the molecular gas than the sfr ; * the nuclear and bar - arm transition regions show enhanced dust mass surface densities and temperature .",
    "the bar - arm transition regions lead to the development of a ` shoulder ' in the radial profile plots .",
    "the position of the shoulder varies between the dust mass surface density and temperature radial profiles ; * the gdr has a mean value of 84 @xmath3 4 , which is close to the galactic value . in the inner regions the gdr extends as high as 200 ; * using an x@xmath10 factor that varies with metallicity decreases the gdr in the inner regions .",

    "the bulk of dust mass is contained in this latter component . in our least - squares",
    "fitting procedure , u@xmath17 ranged from 0.1 to 25 and we vary the fraction , @xmath19 , of the pdr to total emission from 10@xmath20 to 1 .",
    "we fix the pah fraction , q@xmath21 , to 4.58 , common for solar to sub - solar metallicity spiral galaxies ( draine et al .",
    "errors are computed by generating 100 realizations of the photometry using a standard monte carlo simulation .",
    "we find a total dust mass of 5.3 @xmath3 1.0 @xmath14 10@xmath15 m@xmath16 , which is factor of @xmath131.3 greater than a modified blackbody dust mass with @xmath9=2 .",
    "the distribution of the dust mass surface density is similar with that found by the modified blackbody fit ; in addition the u@xmath17 map is similar to the temperature map using a constant @xmath9 .",
    "[ draine ] shows both the dust surface density ( left ) and u@xmath17 distribution using the draine & li ( 2007 ) models .",
    "we find that an enhanced @xmath19 can fit the photometry in the nuclear region and the arms , although our variance in these fitted parameters is larger than the fitted parameters themselves and thus also gives a result consistent with requiring no pdr region .",
    "u@xmath17 is highest in the nuclear region ( mean value in nucleus : 11 @xmath3 5 ; maximum value in nucleus : 18 @xmath3 8) and enhanced along the spiral arms ( mean value in spiral arms : 5 @xmath31 ) .",
    "we also find a similar offset between the peaks in umin and the dust mass as we have found between the dust mass and temperature for the modified blackbody model fits .",
    "in this work we used an sfr tracer that was derived from an h@xmath1 map using a 24  @xmath2 m map for compact source corrections ( see  2.3 ) .",
    "this tracer is developed by implicitly assuming that the diffuse 24  @xmath2 m emission is not associated with recent star formation and thus should be removed ( _ i.e. _ we only use the 24  @xmath2 m emission as a compact source correction ) .",
    "we now examine how these results compare to using an sfr tracer that is a linear combination of two maps and thus includes this diffuse emission .",
    "there are many ways to trace sites of star formation and here we explore two alternative descriptions using a combination of the far - ultraviolet ( uv ) from galex ( gil de paz et al .",
    "2007 ) and 24  @xmath2 m from engelbracht et al .",
    "( 2005 ) as described by leroy et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and a linear combination of h@xmath1 and 24  @xmath2 m ( calzetti et al .  2007 ) .",
    "we first briefly describe the image rendering for this analysis .    in order to make the sfr@xmath22 , we convolved the uv and 24  @xmath2 m maps to the 500  @xmath2 m resolution and deprojected them in accordance with table 2 .",
    "the uv and 24  @xmath2 m images are combined in the following fashion :        for the sfr@xmath27 , we convolve each map to the 500  @xmath2 m and deproject them in accordance with table 2 . the h@xmath1 map is corrected for foreground dust extinction in the milky way as previously described in  2.3 . rather than applying the 24  @xmath2 m correction to hii regions within the galaxy ,",
    "we simply combine the two maps using :        fig .",
    "[ sfr_comp ] provides a direct comparison of the tracers . on the x - axis we plot the sfr used throughout the text , namely h@xmath29 with a compact source correction using 24  @xmath2 m emission . for simplicity",
    "we refer to this simply as h@xmath1 . on the y - axis we plot the sfr based on the linear combination of two tracers with the uv + 24  @xmath2 m on the bottom panel and h@xmath1 + 24  @xmath2 m on the top panel . in both cases",
    "the linear combination overestimates the sfr at low values of the sfr , with the greatest overestimates being for the uv + 24  @xmath2 m .    as clearly stated in kennicutt et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , while a linear combination of h@xmath1 + 24  @xmath2 m may be an appropriate description for the sfr as a global quantity , for spatially resolved measures , errors will be introduced .",
    "due to diffuse dust emission caused by dust heating of older stars , some regions will obtain  spuriously high sfrs where little or no star formation is taking place \" ( kennicutt et al .",
    "2009 ) . for the uv + 24  @xmath2 m tracer",
    ", there is also the diffuse uv component and the longer timescale for the uv emission ( @xmath13100 myr ) in comparison to h@xmath1 ( @xmath1340 myr ) ( see liu et al .",
    "2011 for a discussion and comparison of these tracers ) .    in fig .",
    "[ sfr_dust ] we plot dust mass surface density and dust temperature versus sfr tracer .",
    "we also calculate the correlation coefficients between the different pairs . in the case of dust surface density",
    "we find the correlation coefficients to be 0.75 , 0.83 and 0.84 between the uv + 24  @xmath2 m , h@xmath1 + 24  @xmath2 m and the h@xmath29 with a compact source correction respectively .",
    "in other words , the dust surface density is most strongly correlated with the sfr used in this paper . in the case of the dust temperature",
    "we find an opposite ordering of the correlation coefficients with 0.74 , 0.69 and 0.62 for uv + 24  @xmath2 m , h@xmath1 + 24  @xmath2 m and the h@xmath29 with a compact source correction , respectively .",
    "this suggests that the tracers composed of linear combinations of maps are capturing a diffuse heating component since they are more strongly correlated with dust temperature rather than dust mass surface density , which is coupled to molecular clouds and subsequent star formation activity .",
    "thus , the concern that the diffuse 24  @xmath2 m emission is not tracing recent star formation seems to be valid based on these findings ."
