    "recently , there has been a surge of interest in the more than 30 year old field of diluted magnetic semiconductors@xcite that has been largely motivated by potential application of these materials in spin - based computation@xcite devices . in particular ,",
    "the discovery of _ ferromagnetism _ in low - temperature molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) grown @xmath1 has generated renewed interest . in this",
    "material curie temperatures as high as @xmath2 have been observed.@xcite    it is typically rather difficult to dissolve magnetic impurities in a semiconductor using conventional mbe techniques , because the magnetic ions usually tend to segregate from the host . as a result , these conventionally produced magnetic semiconductors often exhibit spin glass physics at low temperatures and other , undesirable , `` clustering '' effects .",
    "recently ohno achieved the key breakthrough,@xcite by growing @xmath0 at close to room temperature , which minimized mn positional relaxation during the growth process , and resulted in a material with intrinsic ferromagnetic properties , with a curie temperature @xmath3 .",
    "post - growth annealing of the samples was shown to induce changes both in the lattice and positional defects@xcite as well as in the hole concentration.@xcite properties such as magnetization and curie temperature , were found to depend very sensitively on details of the post - growth annealing protocol@xcite . in particular , the measured @xmath4 temperature magnetization has been found to be much less than one expected based on the nominal concentration of mn ions.@xcite the remnant magnetization and the curie temperature @xmath5 were both found to increase upon annealing , but the magnetization reached only about half of the expected value even in the case of optimally annealed samples @xcite . according to recent experimental results , much of the missing magnetization is probably due to interstitial mn ions , which compensate valence band holes,@xcite and , presumably , also bind antiferromagnetically to substitutional mn ions.@xcite as a result , the nominal concentration of mn ions , @xmath6 , is usually substantially larger than the concentration of _ active _ mn ions ( participating in the ferromagnetism ) , @xmath7 , which is larger than the concentration of mobile holes in the valence band ( or possibly impurity band @xcite ) , @xmath8 , with @xmath9 the hole fraction . [ in the remainder of this paper - unless explicitly noted otherwise - we present the results in terms of the active mn concentration : @xmath10 .",
    "] however , especially for samples with a lower doping level and/or shorter annealing times , even this substantial difference in active and nominal mn concentration seems to be insufficient to explain the total amount of lost of magnetization : in some of these samples the remnant magnetization can be substantially increased by a relatively small magnetic field , clearly hinting at a non - collinear magnetic state.@xcite    many of the properties of @xmath1 depend crucially on defects , and understanding these defects is currently a subject of intense research.@xcite @xmath1 is a complicated material : besides containing many defects of unknown origin , it is very disordered , close to a localization transition with a mean free path of the order of the mn - mn distance , has a complicated band structure , has strong spin - orbit coupling and has a large exchange coupling between the localized mn spins and the valence holes .",
    "it is therefore almost impossible to study this material without making some approximations .    as pointed out in ref .",
    "[ ] , spin - orbit coupling can induce frustration and non - collinear states in a disordered magnet . in this paper",
    ", we study the effect of spin - orbit coupling in the metallic limit ( _ i.e. , _ holes are assumed to reside entirely in the valence bands of gaas ) of @xmath0 , and study how it may influence the structure of the ferromagnetic state . to this purpose , we will follow the route outlined in ref .",
    "[ ] and compute the effective interaction between the spin of two substitutional mn impurities by doing perturbation theory in the exchange interaction ( rkky interaction ) .",
    "it is important to note that other mechanisms also exist that could lead to a non - collinear state.@xcite recently , several studies of rkky models of mn spin - spin interactions in gamnas@xcite have been reported , but these studies have not investigated in detail the effects of positional disorder on the magnetic properties using realistic band structure models .    in this work ,",
    "we neglect the effect of other defects and the strong scattering potential on the charged substitutional mn impurities .",
    "this approximation - which is quite common in the literature@xcite - is expected to provide _ qualitatively _ reliable results relatively deep in the metallic state , far away from the localization transition , where screening is expected to reduce the effets of charged impurities . quantitative agreement with experiment will require treating both charging effects and defect correlations in a realistic way.@xcite furthermore , scattering from charged impurities becomes even more important in the dilute limit , and is ultimately responsible for the localization transition that occurs at small concentrations . in this dilute limit",
    ", the strong potential scattering off mn impurities can be treated nonperturbatively , and results similar to those reported here are obtained.@xcite    in the absence of disorder the top of the valence band of @xmath11 can be described within the framework of @xmath12 perturbation theory , which also accounts for the spin - orbit coupling in this material , and gives a good description of the band structure around the @xmath13 point . in particular , we study two different forms of the @xmath12 perturbation theory .",
    "first we study the effective spin - spin interaction within a simplified version of the four band model , the so - called spherical model,@xcite where only the topmost four spin @xmath14 bands are kept and the distortion of the spherical fermi surface is neglected . in this case",
    "analytical results can be obtained for the effective mn spin - spin interaction.@xcite then we study the mn spin - spin interaction using a six band model@xcite ( kohn - luttinger hamiltonian@xcite ) , where the spin - orbit split @xmath15 band is also taken into account . in the latter case",
    "it is not possible to evaluate the interaction kernel analytically , and one must resort to numerics .",
    "although we find in both calculations a strong spin - orbit induced anisotropy in the spin - spin interaction for typical mn - mn distances , the spherical model largely overestimates the size of the anisotropy for small distances .",
    "we find it especially instructive to discuss this result in comparison with those published recently in a nice and intriguing paper by brey and gmez - santos .",
    "@xcite while our result agrees qualitatively with the one obtained in ref .",
    "[ ] , on a _ quantitative _ level it is completely different .",
    "brey and gmez - santos estimated that the largest value of the anisotropy is of the order of @xmath16 .",
    "in contrast , in the present calculation we find that the smallest value of the anisotropy is around @xmath17 for nearest neighbor mn ions at a distance of @xmath18 , and it increases continuously with distance , until it reaches a value of the order of @xmath19 for typical mn - mn distances .",
    "these numbers roughly agree with the results obtained in the very dilute limit for a @xmath20 `` molecule '' within the six band model.@xcite    there are basically two reasons for the discrepancy between the two results : + ( 1 ) presumably to avoid convergence problems , brey and gmez - santos introduced a short distance cut - off @xmath21 , and replaced the exchange interaction between the mn core spins and valence holes by a non - local interaction .",
    "the cut - off scheme they introduced , however , is not compatible with the general structure of the exchange interaction derived in the microscopic theory of quantum impurities.@xcite as we discuss in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : six_band ] , the corresponding momentum cut - off introduced should not be smaller than @xmath22 , the typical momentum transfer during backscattering . unfortunately , the cut - off @xmath23 used in ref .",
    "[ ] did not satisfy this criterion , and as a consequence , the results of ref .",
    "[ ] showed a very strong dependence on @xmath21 : in particular , for somewhat smaller values of @xmath24 brey and gmez - santos found an anisotropy of a few percent , which roughly agrees with the one we find ( @xmath25 1 % ) within a cut - off scheme compatible with the general theory of magnetic interactions for nearest neighbor mn ions .",
    "the strong dependence of the brey - gmez - santos result on the cut - off parameter was also pointed out and questioned recently by timm and macdonald in ref .",
    "we emphasize that with our cut - off scheme the anisotropy depends only _ weakly _ on the value of @xmath21 . + ( 2 ) secondly , in ref .",
    "[ ] it has been assumed that the anisotropy is largest for the shortest mn - mn separations .",
    "however , for hole concentrations @xmath26 one actually expects on general grounds that the _ asymptotic _ form of the rkky interaction is reasonably well - approximated within the four band model , which assumes infinite spin - orbit splitting @xmath27 , and that the anisotropy increases with mn - mn separation .",
    "this is indeed supported by our numerical results : for the very small separations for which brey and gomez - santos carried out their calculations we indeed find only a @xmath28 anisotropy , while for _ typical _ mn - mn separations we find a rather large anisotropy of the order of @xmath29 .",
    "having the interaction kernels at hand , we considered a distribution of mn ions and carried out finite temperature monte carlo simulations to characterize the magnetic properties of the system . at present , it is unclear from the experiments to what extent the positions of _ substitutional _ , magnetically active mn are correlated during the growth process . in order to gain insight into how mn positional correlations may affect the magnetic properties of a material like gamnas , we studied the dependence of the curie temperature , the saturation magnetization , the shape of the magnetization curve and the ground state spin distribution on mn positional correlations .",
    "these correlations were introduced by allowing repulsive interactions between the mn ions and relaxing them through a zero temperature monte carlo metropolis algorithm in a way similar to ref .",
    "we started the simulations from a set of completely uncorrelated initial mn positions , and allowed the substitutional mn ions to move .",
    "we then studied the magnetic properties of the spin system as a function of the mn positional relaxation time , including the completely uncorrelated configuration .",
    "our main results are as follows : within the spherical approximation we find a strongly disordered ( non - collinear ) ferromagnetic ground state for unrelaxed mn positions , where the ground state magnetization can be reduced by as much as @xmath30 with respect to its saturation value . upon relaxing the mn positions , however , the remnant magnetization increases , and for a fully relaxed lattice one may recover as much as @xmath31 of the saturation value .",
    "in contrast to our earlier expectations,@xcite the obtained non - collinear state is _ not _ a spin - glass : although a finite system displays hysteresis , the coercive field we compute _ decreases _ with system size , implying that the hysteresis vanishes in the infinite system size limit .",
    "the frustration effects found within the spherical model are very sensitive to the hole fraction @xmath32 characterizing the degree of compensation , and become more pronounced for larger hole fractions .",
    "spin - orbit coupling induced anisotropy does not have such a dramatic effect if we use the kernel obtained within the six - band model . for a substitutional mn concentration of @xmath33 , hole fraction @xmath34 , and unrelaxed mn",
    "spins we find that the magnetization is reduced by @xmath35 , relative to the fully polarized state , corresponding to a typical non - collinear angle of the order of @xmath36 degrees .",
    "this non - collinearity is , however , almost completely suppressed if we let the mn positions relax using the monte carlo algorithm mentioned above . by increasing the substitutional mn concentration to @xmath37",
    "the ground state becomes almost fully collinear even without relaxing the mn positions .",
    "the results do not depend too strongly on the level of compensation ( hole fraction ) .",
    "our results also indicate that anisotropy effects may be more important for smaller mn concentrations.@xcite    we emphasize again that the concentration @xmath6 above denotes the concentration of _ active _ mn ions , _",
    "i.e. _ the concentration of those mn ions that participate in the formation of the ferromagnetic state . due to compensation effects induced by interstitial mn impurities , @xmath6 is usually much less than the nominal concentration of mn ions .",
    "in fact , samples with a nominal concentration of @xmath38 may easily have an active mn concentration in the range @xmath39 .",
    "in this concentration range the impurity band approach of refs .  [ ] and [ ] may be more appropriate .    in agreement with the results of ref .",
    "[ ] , we also find that in all cases @xmath5 decreases as we relax the mn impurities , irrespective of the specific form of effective interaction used , and @xmath40 becomes more mean - field like at the same time .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : interaction ] we present the rkky calculation within the baldereschi - lipari spherical approximation for the effective interaction between two mn spins .",
    "several of the most technical details and lengthy expressions have been relegated to appendices  [ app : rkky_calculation ] and [ app : appendix_int ] .",
    "[ sec : six_band ] is devoted to the computation of the effective mn spin - spin interaction within the full six band model . in sec .",

    "[ sec : conclusions ] we summarize our main conclusions .",
    "in the present section , we study the effective rkky interaction between two mn impurities , by using the so - called spherical approximation to describe the valence band hole fluid .",
    "the top of the valence band of gaas consists of six @xmath41-bands .",
    "four of these bands become fourfold degenerate at the @xmath13 point and have spin @xmath14 character , while the other two are split off by @xmath42 and have spin @xmath15 character.@xcite    the spherical approximation consists of setting the spin - orbit splitting @xmath27 to infinity , keeping only the spin @xmath14 bands , neglecting the warping of the fermi surface due to the cubic symmetry of the crystal , and approximating the dispersion of the holes by the following expression:@xcite @xmath43 here @xmath44 is the quadrupolar angular momentum of the holes .",

    "physically the parameter @xmath48 describes how the spin of a @xmath14 valence hole couples to its orbital motion .    the advantage of the spherical approximation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : h_sp ] ) , is that it makes it possible to obtain analytical results while it gives a realistic description of the top of the valence band .",
    "as we will see , this latter fact is somewhat misleading : while providing a qualitatively correct description of the valence bands of ga@xmath49mn@xmath50as , it gives quantitatively incorrect results for the rkky interaction between two local spins .    in gamnas subsitutional",
    "mn ions are believed to be in a @xmath51 configuraration@xcite thereby behaving as a negatively charged scatterer and having a core spin @xmath52 .",
    "this core spin then couples to the spin of the valence hole fluid through an exchange interaction that , for a single mn ion , takes the following form within the spherical approximation : @xmath53 where @xmath54 denotes the valence holes spin density , at the location of the mn ion , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 is an antiferromagnetic coupling .    to proceed",

    "in the previous section we studied the effective rkky interaction between two mn impurities within the spherical approximation . in the present section we shall study the effective mn spin - spin interaction by using a more realistic description of the top of the valence band , the so - called six band model , where the hamiltonian reads @xmath126 with @xmath127 being the so - called kohn - luttinger hamiltonian , and @xmath128 the spin density of the holes at position @xmath129 .",

    "[ ] : we generated a mesh in momentum - space , computed the eigenenergies of @xmath127 and the corresponding eigenfunctions , and ordered them according to their energy .",
    "we then computed the matrix elements of @xmath133 in this basis by treating the spin of the mn ions classically , and fixing their direction .",
    "next we diagonalized @xmath134 to obtain the single particle hole states for this orientation of the spins , while only keeping states below the cut - off energy , @xmath135 .",
    "finally , we computed the ground state energy of the whole system as a sum of the energy of the occupied single particle states , and thus obtained the ground state energy of the system for a _ fixed _ number of holes as a function of the direction of the two spins .",

    "one therefore experiences _ large _ but apparently systematic fluctuations of the exchange energy computed as one fills the single particle energy levels for @xmath145 one by one ( see the inset of fig .",

    "this technique has been exploited in ref .",

    "another very important issue is the cut - off scheme used : to facilitate convergence , it is important to introduce a cut - off for the exchange coupling in momentum space .",
