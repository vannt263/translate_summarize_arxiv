    "* ) . in previous papers",
    "@xcite we developed a simple model to describe the temperature , density , chemistry , and dynamical evolution of the starless cores .",
    "those studies suggest that the starless cores can be conceptually divided into two classes , thermally subcritical and thermally supercritical depending on whether their central densities are very roughly less or greater than a few @xmath7 @xmath5 respectively .",
    "this density is significant as the approximate value of two critical densities in the physics of starless cores .",
    "first , at this density gas cooling by collisional coupling with dust is about as efficient as cooling by molecular line radiation .",
    "the gas temperature in the center of the supercritical cores is therefore significantly lower than in their envelopes and lower than found anywhere in the subcritical cores .",
    "second , at this density , cores of a few m@xmath8 are at critical dynamical stability with respect to gravitational collapse .",
    "the thermally subcritical cores are stable against gravitational collapse and their dynamics may be dominated by oscillations @xcite . in contrast , the supercritical cores are unstable with predominantly inward velocities @xcite    in previous papers @xcite we modeled the internal oscillations ( sound waves ) in thermally subcritical cores and computed some observable molecular spectral line profiles during the oscillations . in this paper , we model the dynamical and chemical evolution of a thermally supercritical core and compute observable molecular spectral line emission during the early stages of gravitational contraction leading up to free - fall collapse .",
    "our model is a one - dimensional numerical hydrodynamics code @xcite that includes the radiative equilibrium of dust , gas cooling by both molecular lines and collisional coupling with the dust , and a simplified molecular chemistry @xcite . to compare the model with observations we use our numerical code for non - lte radiative transfer mollie to predict the observable molecular spectral line emission @xcite .",
    "previously we modeled overlapping hyperfine emission by assuming that the hyperfine components are in statistical equilibrium .",
    "here we use an updated algorithm that does not make this assumption and better reproduces the non - lte hyperfine line ratios ( excitation anomalies ) that are seen in n@xmath0h@xmath1 spectra from many of the starless cores @xcite .",
    "we compare these predictions to previous observations of one specific core , l1544 whose properties place it in the thermally supercritical class",
    ".    there has been some considerable research into the topic of how gas clouds contract to form protostars including some classic papers in the field @xcite .",
    "more recent studies also address the chemical evolution of the starless cores using a variety of models for the dynamics of gravitationally contracting cores .",
    "@xcite followed the chemical evolution of a gravitationally collapsing core assuming the larson - penston ( lp ) approximation for the densities and velocities . in a subsequent paper , @xcite improved on this model using a numerical hydrodynamic code @xcite to follow the collapse of an isothermal bonnor - ebert ( be ) sphere . @xcite",
    "and @xcite showed that in the case of static be spheres there was little difference between the structure of an isothermal be sphere and one in radiative equilibrium .",
    "our numerical hydrodynamic simulation that allows for radiative equilibrium during collapse also confirms that the isothermal approximation used in @xcite is quite adequate for dynamic as well as static be spheres ( our  [ insideout ] ) .",

    "@xcite approximated the contraction of a be sphere as a progression of static spheres of increasing central density .",

    "@xcite and @xcite modeled the chemical evolution during the formation of a 2d rotating accretion disk and protostar .",
    "our spherical model applies to earlier evolutionary times while the contracting core still maintains its be structure .",
    "@xcite and @xcite followed the chemical evolution during the contraction of cores that are supported by a spherical approximation of magnetic pressure .",
    "the contraction is controlled by leakage of the magnetic field out of the core by ambipolar diffusion . in the spherical approximation , this is modeled by a diffusion equation in lagrangian coordinates ( equation 3 of * ? ? ?",
    "one difficulty with assessing the applicability of spherical models of magnetic collapse is that the approximation of spherical symmetry results in a density structure that , similar to the sis and be spheres , can be approximated by a polytrope with an index that depends on the effective equation of state .",
    "observationally , it is difficult to distinguish polytropes of different index because their density structures are most different from one another at small and large radii where the observations have difficulties with angular resolution and sensitivity ( low density gas ) respectively .    in contrast",
    ", there is strong observational motivation for the model of thermal support .",
    "masses , densities , and temperatures estimated in surveys of starless cores suggest that thermal energy provides about 75% of the internal energy required for equilibrium @xcite .",
    "the remaining 25% could be in magnetic energy or wave energy or a combination of both . while the 25% non - thermal energy is important for the dynamical stability and evolution of the core ,",
    "the structure of the core is determined largely by the dominant thermal energy .",
    "our study is different from previous studies in that we consider the evolution of a be sphere rather than an accretion disk plus protostar , or an sis sphere , or a magnetically supported sphere .",
    "our simulations is the first that follows the dynamics of the contraction simultaneously and self - consistently with radiative equilibrium and a simple model for the chemistry that allows for changes in the molecular line cooling as the molecular abundances in the gas phase change with time .",
    "we first discuss the dynamics of the gravitational contraction of a be sphere .",
    "our code is best suited for subsonic velocities and we confine our discussion to the early phase of evolution .",
    "we then discuss how the gas phase abundance of co evolves during contraction .",
    "we predict how the molecular line strengths should vary across the model from center to edge at different times during the contraction , and we compare this prediction with ratios of line strengths previously observed in l1544 .",
    "we intend the comparison in a general sense only and not in detail .",
    "for example , the model is spherically symmetric while both the observed morphology @xcite and observed spectra @xcite indicate that both the density and velocity structure of l1544 are more complex than can be reproduced by a purely spherical model .",
    "we model a core of 10 m@xmath8 that begins its evolution with an initial density of @xmath9 @xmath5 in a state of radiative and dynamical equilibrium .",

    ". based on the results of @xcite we use our higher dust opacities that are equal to four times the standard dust opacities of @xcite , and we use a rate of cosmic ray ionization of @xmath10 s@xmath3 referred to as the `` low '' rate in @xcite . in that investigation",
    ", this combination was found to result in gas temperatures that match those suggested by the observations of @xcite at their suggested central density of @xmath11 @xmath5 .",
    "figures [ fig : densities ] and [ fig : velocities ] show the density and velocity profiles during contraction as the central density increases from its initial value to @xmath12 @xmath5 over a time period of 1 myr .",
    "the shapes of the density and velocity profiles that are generated by the numerical simulation can be understood in terms of relatively simple theory .",
    "we begin with the density profile .",
    "the density profiles in figure [ fig : densities ] show an outer region where the density scales as @xmath13 and an inner region where the density is nearly constant . as the evolving core contracts ,",
    "the density profile maintains this shape even as the central density increases @xcite .",
    "thus we should expect to observe this characteristic shape in almost all starless cores , and this is generally confirmed by observations .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite suggested that the density profiles derived from observations of dust emission could be well matched by two power laws , one shallow and one steep .",
    "this approximation is also suggested by the numerical studies of the contraction of a be sphere cited above .",
    "@xcite suggested that the density profile can be better fit by , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the radius of the inner region .",
    "this equation along with @xmath15 , which we define below , provides a convenient approximation for future use .      in the center of",
    "a be sphere , where the sound - crossing time is less than the free - fall time , density perturbations are rapidly smoothed by pressure waves . also the self - gravity in the center",
    "is relatively weak so that the gas is essentially confined by the pressure of the overlying gas .",
    "both these effects act to maintain constant density around the center .",
    "previously , the size of the region with a flat density profile , @xmath15 , was determined empirically for individual cores from their observations .",
    "we can also determine this radius theoretically . at @xmath15",
    "the ratio of the sound - crossing and free - fall times ought to be one .",
    "therefore , @xmath15 is the product of the sound speed , @xmath16 , and the free - fall time at the central density , @xmath17 , @xmath18 this provides a better approximation in equation 1 than the standard scale length of a be sphere , @xmath19^{1/2}$ ] @xcite and is also useful in suggesting the physics behind the behavior of a contracting be sphere . the radius , @xmath15 is equal to the jeans length for sound speed , @xmath16 , and density , @xmath17 .",
    "figure [ fig : densities ] compares the density profile computed by equations [ eq : plummer ] and [ eq : criticalradius ] , assuming a gas temperature of 10 k and a central density of @xmath20 @xmath5 ( green curve ) , against the density profile computed by the numerical hydrodynamic simulation .",
    "the comparison suggests that equations [ eq : plummer ] and [ eq : criticalradius ] provide a good , simple approximation to the density profile of a be sphere .",
    "( a more accurate approximation is described in @xcite . ) because the numerical hydrodynamic simulation also accounts for a variable temperature set by radiative equilibrium , the comparison in figure 1 also shows that the departures from isothermal owing to radiative equilibrium have little effect on the overall density structure of the core .",
    "figure [ fig : densities ] also shows the characteristic radius , @xmath15 , for the different evolutionary times during the contraction .",
    "the figure shows that equation [ eq : criticalradius ] provides a good approximation to the turn - over radius , @xmath15 , at all times in the evolution .",
    "according to equation 2 , this width shrinks as the central density of a contracting be sphere increases . in the subsonic phase of gravitational contraction ,",
    "@xmath15 moves at about half the maximum gas velocity where this maximum is taken from the velocity profiles for each evolutionary time as shown in figure [ fig : velocities ] .    in comparing our theoretical results to several observations , we find that a central density of about @xmath20 @xmath5 provides a better match to the observations (  [ lines ] ) than central densities that are a factor of 10 higher or lower .",
    "this estimate is in agreement with the density of @xmath21 @xmath5 suggested by the observations of @xcite if we average the theoretical density profile over the size of their observing beam .",
    "although the theoretical density profile appears flat in the center of a log - log plot of density versus radius , it is sharply peaked within the size of the observing beam .",
    "the average density within a radius of 500 au ( observing beam size of 1000 au = 7 \" at 140 pc ) is @xmath22 corresponding to a peak density of @xmath4 @xmath5 .",
    "in fact , at a spatial resolution of 1000 au , observations have difficulty measuring the central density .",
    "for example , the average density over 1000 au corresponding to a peak density of @xmath23 @xmath5 is only @xmath24 @xmath5 , little different from the average density of @xmath22 @xmath5 corresponding to a peak density of @xmath4 @xmath5 .    in our previous paper @xcite",
    ", we used the lower central density of @xmath21 @xmath5 and stated that a higher central density would imply a higher density throughout the core .",
    "this is not correct .",
    "owing to the inside - out character of the collapse , the central density increases much more rapidly than the densities outside of @xmath15 .",
    "as explained in the next section , in an evolving core , the densities over most of the core are actually about the same for both these higher and lower central densities ( figure [ fig : densities ] ) .      in their numerical hydrodynamic simulations of gravitationally collapsing gas clouds , @xcite found that regardless of the initial configuration of the cloud or the initial conditions , all their examples evolved to density profiles scaling as @xmath13 in their outer regions .",
    "@xcite suggests that this scaling is a property shared by all self - gravitating isothermal systems under certain general conditions .",
    "the system should evolve subsonically , meaning that it should be close to hydrostatic equilibrium initially , and the outer region should not be affected by an outer bounding surface .",
    "these conditions are applicable to contracting be spheres .",
    "the initial state is one of hydrostatic balance , albeit unstable .",
    "although be spheres have an outer boundary which is the radius at which the lane - emden equation is truncated , the external pressure at the boundary is the same as would be provided by the lane - emden equation if the solution were continued .",
    "thus in the initial configuration , the density profile is the same as if the core had no outer boundary .",
    "figure [ fig : velocities ] shows that the be sphere evolves by subsonic contraction to resemble the sis , a result also found in earlier studies @xcite .",
    "as the central density increases with the contraction , the characteristic radius , @xmath15 , moves inward , the constant density region shrinks in size , and the outer region with its density profile scaling as @xmath25 accounts for more and more of the core . because the density of the outer region changes very slowly , the density contrast between the inner and outer regions also increases rapidly .",
    "thus , as the contraction proceeds , the be sphere evolves to resemble an sis with its @xmath13 density profile everywhere and its infinite density contrast .",
    "this behavior is expected if we recall that the static equilibrium solutions of the lane - emden equation form a continuous series with increasing density concentration and the sis as the limiting case @xcite . during the subsonic , quasi - static phase of contraction , an unstable",
    "be sphere evolves approximately along this series of static equilibria toward the limiting case of an sis .",
    "the velocity profile during the subsonic phase of the contraction of a be sphere ( figure 2 ) shows a characteristic @xmath26-shape with the inward velocity as a function of radius increasing from near zero in the core center to a maximum just outside the characteristic radius , @xmath15 , before decreasing again toward the edge of the core @xcite .",
    "the origin of this profile can be understood by considering the forces inside and outside of @xmath15 . in the very center ,",
    "the velocity is zero by symmetry . in the region , @xmath15 , where the density is constant ,",
    "the instantaneous acceleration due to the gravitational force increases linearly with radius .",
    "the velocity , which is the time - integrated acceleration , may also be expected to increase with radius as well , and this is verified by the numerical evolution .",
    "outside of @xmath15 , the density falls off as @xmath13 .",
    "here the instantaneous gravitational acceleration decreases with radius along with its influence on the velocity . during the contraction ,",
    "the redistribution of mass in the center does not change the gravitational acceleration in the outer region because of spherical symmetry .",
    "thus , in the outer region , the only change to the hydrostatic balance is due to the pressure force which propagates outward from the center only at the sound speed .",
    "these several effects that would change the hydrostatic balance in the outer region all decrease as we move outward , away from @xmath15 .",
    "thus the outer region remains in approximate hydrostatic balance with low inward velocities for about a sound - crossing time , on the order of 1 myr , and the velocities are lower at larger radii , further from @xmath15 .",
    "the same characteristic @xmath26-shaped profile also develops if we consider the pressure - free collapse of a be sphere . in this case",
    "the gas pressure is ignored and the velocity field is determined solely by the variation of the gravitational force with radius . @xcite .",
    "of course , the gas pressure is required to obtain the initial be density distribution in the first place .",
    "in the previous section we saw that the dynamics of a contracting be sphere , as followed by a numerical simulation that included radiative and chemical equilibrium , were well matched by a simpler isothermal approximation . in this section",
    "we will see that the temperature and chemistry of an evolving core have a significant effect on the observable molecular line spectra .",
    "the gas temperature directly affects the line brightness through the source function .",
    "the chemistry affects the line brightness through the gas phase abundance of the observable molecules .",
    "the most significant processes affecting the abundances are the depletion of molecules from the gas phase as they freeze onto dust grains in the dense center of a core and photodissociation of molecules near the core boundary .",
    "we calculate the co abundance with a simple model that includes these two processes @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : structure123 ] shows the gas temperatures , density , velocity , and co abundance at 3 different times during the collapse when the central density is @xmath21 , @xmath20 , and @xmath27 @xmath5 . as discussed further in  [ lines ] , a model with a central density of @xmath20 @xmath5 provides a better match to the observations than central densities that are a factor of 10 lower or higher .",
    "also shown are the density , temperature , and abundance of static cores that have the same central densities as the dynamically evolving core .",
    "the properties of the contracting cores are similar to those of the static cores with the same central density , with the exception of the velocity .",
    "the starless cores are heated from the outside by both cosmic rays and by the diffuse interstellar radiation field supplied by the population of stars in the galaxy .",
    "the cores are cooled by the long wavelength radiation from cold dust and by molecular lines . because the incoming shorter wavelength starlight is strongly absorbed by the cores whereas the outgoing long wavelength radiation from cold dust is not , the denser cores are coldest in their centers .",
    "this temperature structure has previously been calculated in quite a number of papers ( references in * ? ? ? * ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : structure123 ] we see that the central temperature of the static core with a central density of @xmath27 @xmath5 is quite low , below 5 k. in the evolving core , compressive heating keeps the temperature above 5 k , more consistent with the temperatures inferred from molecular line and dust observations @xcite .      in our previous paper",
    "we assumed that the rate for the desorption of co off dust , the inverse process to depletion or freeze - out , was due to whole - grain heating by cosmic rays ( equation 11 * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "when we compare the c@xmath28o and c@xmath29o spectra predicted by our radiative transfer code mollie with observations of l1544 we find that the predicted lines are not bright enough to match the observations .",
    "since these co lines are optically thin , the co column density is too low .",
    "the desorption rate can not be increased by simply increasing the flux of cosmic rays . in our earlier study",
    "we found that a higher flux of cosmic rays would cause the gas temperature at mid - radii to be higher than suggested by observations ( figure 12 * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "there are other processes in addition to direct cosmic - ray strikes that cause desorption and increase the gas phase abundance of co @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the energy transferred to dust by the uv radiation field produced by cosmic - ray strikes on molecular hydrogen is almost one order of magnitude larger than the energy transferred directly to dust by the cosmic - ray particles themselves .",
    "@xcite suggested that in addition to direct and indirect heating by cosmic rays , another significant source of heat is the exothermic formation of h@xmath0 on the grain surfaces .",
    "@xcite suggest that the rates of these heating processes are not known . however , because all the processes depend on the first power of the density , the same as direct cosmic ray heating , we can account for additional desorption processes in our model by simply increasing the desorption rate above that given by equation 11 of @xcite while still assuming the same first - power dependence on the gas density .",
    "figure [ fig : abundance ] shows the abundance of co obtained as an equilibrium between the 4 processes of depletion , desorption , photodissociation and chemical formation , and calculated for 4 different desorption rates .",
    "the lowest rate is equivalent to desorption caused by direct cosmic - ray strikes @xcite on dust at the `` low '' cosmic - ray rate ( @xmath10 s@xmath3 ) as defined in equation 11 of @xcite .",
    "the higher desorption rates are factors of 3 , 9 , and 30 higher than the lowest rate . in order to match the observed co spectra ( figure [ fig : spectrum123 ] ) we find that we need to increase our desorption rate by a factor of 30 . at this rate , desorption and depletion have equal time scales at a density of about @xmath30 @xmath5 .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : abundance ] , with the highest desorption rate , the maximum co abundance is about a factor of 2.5 higher than with the lowest rate .",
    "this increase in abundance makes the optically thin c@xmath29o and c@xmath28o lines almost a factor of 2 brighter and a better match to the observations .",
    "the gas phase abundance could also be increased by decreasing the reverse reaction of freeze - out .",
    "one way this could occur is if the dust grains in the center of l1544 were fewer in number but larger in size , for example by coagulation .",
    "this would decrease the total surface area available for freeze - out @xcite .",
    "there is some independent evidence for coagulated grains @xcite .",
    "however , to reduce the rate of freeze - out by a factor of 30 , would require a mean grain diameter of about 10  @xmath31 m , too large according to available models of dust coagulation in dense clouds @xcite .",
    "decreased depletion at a rate slower than equation 8 of @xcite could contribute to the higher co abundance , but could not bring the co abundance up high enough to match the spectral line observations .",
    "finally , decreased photodissociation might also increase the co abundance .",
    "this could come about if the uv flux were diminished , for example , if the core were embedded in a larger scale molecular cloud .",
    "we ran a separate radiative transfer calculation and found that the co abundance can not be increased deep enough into the core to make a difference to the line brightness .",
    "the time scale for co to freeze onto dust , @xmath32 ( equation 8 * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the time scale for the inverse process of desorption , @xmath33 ( @xmath34 equation 11 * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may be combined to determine the time scale for the change of co in the gas phase @xcite , @xmath35    this time scale for the equilibration of the co abundance varies across the core but is everywhere aster than the dynamical time . in the core center ,",
    "the free - fall time is a close approximation whereas in the more slowly evolving outer region , the sound crossing time is more appropriate .",
    "a starless core with a mass of 10 m@xmath8 and a central density of @xmath11 @xmath5 has a free - fall time , @xmath36 myr using the central density in the standard equation whereas the sound crossing time is about 2 myr . in comparison , at the center of the core , the co equilibration time scale @xmath37 myr , a factor of 3 shorter than the free - fall time . at the edge of the core where the density is 20 @xmath5 , @xmath38 myr , still a factor of 4 shorter than the sound crossing time . throughout the contraction .",
    "figure [ fig : structure123 ] shows that the abundance of co during the contraction of a be sphere is everywhere quite close to its steady state value . for this reason , it is not possible to use co as a chemical clock in starless cores .",
    "the previous discussion demonstrates the importance of desorption in determining the co abundance .",
    "the desorption rate is required to determine the equilibrium abundance toward which the system evolves asymptotically . in particular , the co abundance should not be calculated simply from the depletion rate as an exponentially decreasing function of time as would be the case if desorption were ignored . even in gas",
    "dense enough that the depletion rate is much faster , general considerations always require both the forward and reverse reactions .",
    "real physical systems must satisfy detailed balance and time reversibility @xcite . a system described by a single rate equation , for example depletion only without desorption ,",
    "does not satisfy these conditions , can not describe a physical system , and this description will produce misleading results .",
    "all other things being equal , a collisionally excited , optically thin line should increase in brightness with the path length and the gas density .",
    "thus molecular lines should be brightest through the center of the core .",
    "observations of starless cores do not always show this behavior because of varying molecular abundances within the core @xcite .",
    "for example , figure 2 of @xcite reproduced here as figure [ fig : caselli99 ] shows the brightness of the ( 1 - 0 ) transitions of c@xmath29o , c@xmath28o , and n@xmath39 at a set of positions across the l1544 core from edge to center to edge .",
    "the n@xmath39 molecule does not suffer much , if any , depletion from the gas phase at high densities , and the observed n@xmath39 brightness increases toward the core center whereas the observed co brightness does not .",
    "this difference is due to the near complete depletion of co at higher density .",
    "it is possible that n@xmath0h@xmath1 may be slightly depleted in the center of l1544 @xcite although we do not include this effect in our model .",
    "we will investigate this possibility in a future modeling of higher density tracers and transitions .",
    "our modeling here shows that the decrease in temperature in the core center is not sufficient to significantly decrease the line brightness .",
    "figure [ fig : trace123 ] shows the simulated integrated spectral line brightness as a trace of positions across the model evolving cores in the same format as the observational data in figure [ fig : caselli99 ] .",
    "the integrated intensities include the emission from all three hyperfine lines of c@xmath29o(10 ) and all seven hyperfine lines of n@xmath0h@xmath1(10 ) . at central densities",
    "greater than @xmath40 @xmath5 the modeled brightness begins to look like the observations .",
    "there are some differences .",
    "the observational data might show a slight dip in the integrated intensity of the co lines toward the center which is not present in the model .",
    "however , there is a decrease in the peak intensity of the modeled co lines ( figure [ fig : peak123 ] ) .",
    "this dip does not show up in the integrated intensity because the line widths in the model increase toward the center owing to the increase in the inward velocities in the inside - out collapse ( figures [ fig : width123 ] ) .",
    "the increase in the line width of co is less than that of n@xmath39 because , owing to depletion , there is essentially no gas phase co in the center of the core where the velocities are highest . from a density of @xmath11 to @xmath23 @xmath5 the c@xmath29o and c@xmath28o line widths increase by 0.07 and 0.06 kms@xmath3 while the n@xmath0h@xmath1 line width increases by 0.15 kms@xmath3 .    because the density , temperature , and abundance structures of contracting cores are so similar to those of static cores , the primary observable evidence of contraction is not the line brightness , but rather the shapes of those spectral lines such as n@xmath39(1 - 0 ) that are optically thick enough to show self - absorption .",
    "figure [ fig : spectrum123 ] shows the spectral line profiles of the ( 1 - 0 ) transitions of c@xmath29o , c@xmath28o , and n@xmath39 expected from our model for the 3 evolutionary times corresponding to figure [ fig : structure123 ] . as the inward velocities increase during the contraction , the n@xmath0h@xmath1 spectral lines become wider ( figure [ fig : width123 ] ) , and eventually split into two peaks ( figure [ fig : spectrum123 ] ) because of the inward velocities in the core ( figure [ fig : structure123 ] ) . in contrast , because there is little co in the center where the velocities are highest , the width of the co lines changes very little ( figure [ fig : width123 ] ) as the core evolves , and the co lines do not split ( figure [ fig : spectrum123 ] ) .",
    "the brightness of both the n@xmath0h@xmath1 and co lines are nearly constant as the central density increases from @xmath11 to @xmath23 @xmath5 because there is very little change in the density of most of the core except for the center where co is depleted .",
    "the slight decrease in the peak brightness of c@xmath28o ( figure [ fig : peak123 ] and [ fig : spectrum123 ] ) is consistent with a constant integrated intensity and the slight increase in line width ( figure [ fig : width123 ] ) .",
    "as the core evolves from a central density of @xmath4 to @xmath23 @xmath5 there is very little change in any of the observed spectra , either co or n@xmath0h@xmath1 , because the density increase is happening in a very small region in the center that does not contain much mass relative to the entire core and is also becoming small compared to the observing beam .",
    "thus the n@xmath0h@xmath1 spectra ( figure [ fig : spectrum123 ] ) for the last two evolutionary times look almost the same .",
    "interferometric observations of higher density transitions of n@xmath0h@xmath1 and n@xmath0d@xmath1 will be needed to unveil the dynamical stage , structure and kinematics of the rapidly contracting center of the core .",
    "this will be investigated in a future paper .",
    "we follow the contraction of a thermally supercritical core through the evolutionary phase of subsonic contraction with a numerical code that includes radiative and chemical equilibrium .",
    "we identify a characteristic radius , the product of the sound speed and the free - fall time , as the point where the density profile of a be sphere transitions from an outer region where the density scales as @xmath13 to an inner region of constant or flat density . in the inner region ,",
    "the dynamical time is the gravitational free - fall time at the central density . in the outer region ,",
    "the dynamical time is the much slower sound - crossing time .",
    "the difference results in inside - out collapse .",
