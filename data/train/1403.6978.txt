    "it is well known that the spin splitting ( ss ) of energies in various quantum systems is intimately related to their symmetry . according to the kramers theorem",
    ", the energy of an electron in a periodic system satisfies the equality : @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the wave vector and the arrows @xmath3 and @xmath4 signify spin - up and spin - down projections , respectively . if , in addition , a system is characterized by the inversion symmetry , the two spin states are degenerate for any @xmath5 value : @xmath6 . in general , however , for a given @xmath7 direction and value ss may occur even without an external magnetic field .",
    "it was shown by dresselhaus [ 1 ] that in bulk semiconductors of the zinc blende structure , which have no inversion symmetry , the conduction bands of iii - v compounds are characterized by an anisotropic spin splitting proportional to @xmath8 for small @xmath9 values .",
    "this splitting was extensively investigated in bulk semiconductors . with the advancement of semiconductor quantum structures a new type of inversion asymmetry became possible , namely the structure inversion asymmetry ( sia ) .",
    "the sia mechanism also leads to ss of electron energies .",
    "the ss related to sia , often called `` the rashba splitting '' , is of interest due to possible applications , as it can be influenced by an external electric bias .",
    "this interest is a part of the wider movement aimed to use properties of electron spin for technical use .",
    "the subject of ss related to sia has a controversial history , as reviewed by the present authors [ 2 ] . in a widely quoted paper , bychkov and rashba [ 3 ]",
    "wrote down the following hamiltonian for ss in heterostructures , in which the growth direction is parallel to a high symmetry axis @xmath10 here @xmath11 are the pauli matrices , @xmath5 is the 2d electron wave vector transverse to the growth direction , @xmath12 is the unit vector in the growth direction , and @xmath13 is a coefficient . in their paper , bychkov and rashba did not mention the inversion asymmetry , but it is recognized by now that the coefficient @xmath13 has a nonzero value only if the system is characterized by a structure inversion asymmetry along the growth direction .",
    "the hamiltonian given by eq .",
    "( 1 ) resembles that of the spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) , but one should not confuse it with the soi in which an electric field @xmath14 appears instead of @xmath12 . as follows from the description given in [ 2 ] , a consensus on the theoretical treatment of the problem of ss due to sia has been reached , see also [ 4 - 6 ] .",
    "namely , it has been demonstrated that the ss of conduction energies in asymmetric quantum wells ( qws ) is mostly related to asymmetric offsets of the conduction and valence bands , both due to different energy gaps and spin - orbit energies . in particular , the ss of a conduction band is not proportional to the electric field in this band because the average electric field in a bound state is zero if one neglects a difference of the effective masses in the well and barriers [ 7 ] .",
    "it was recognized a few years ago that the soi can be used to manipulate electron spins in semiconductor heterostructures .",
    "in particular , it was proposed to fabricate spin filters by either driving electrons through inhomogeneous heterostructures with different strengths of the soi [ 8 , 9 ] or by reflecting 2d electrons from a lateral potential barrier in an asymmetric quantum well [ 10 - 15 ] .",
    "recently , the present authors described spin - flip and spin - conserving electron reflections from a potential barrier in a vacuum using the dirac equation for relativistic electrons [ 16 ] .",
    "in this paper we are concerned with the spin - flip reflection processes in heterostructures .",
    "it was exprimentally demonstrated by chen et al [ 10 , 12 , 14 ] that , in the presence of the soi , an opaque reflection from a potential barrier separates electrons undergoing spin - flip reflections from those experiencing spin - conserving reflections . in their system ,",
    "the electron spin splitting was caused by sia of asymmetric qws and the interaction with the barrier . in our paper",
    "we describe the spin - flip and spin - conserving reflections introducing three new elements .",
    "first , we consider the simplest system in which _ the only _ source of electron spin - splitting is its interaction with the barrier .",
    "this can be realized either by using a symmetric qw or by performing experiments without 2d heterostructures .",
    "second , we actually calculate the spin splitting of unbound electron energies due to the interaction with the barrier , which was not attempted in previous works .",
    "third , we point out quite unusual possibilities of non - attenuated electron propagation in the barrier whose height exceeds the energies of incoming electrons and the total reflection of electrons whose energies exceed barrier s height .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we consider the spin splitting of electron energies due to the interaction with the barrier .",

    "was experimentally realized by chen and coworkers in insb / inalsb and inas / algasb heterostructures [ 10 , 12 , 14 ] . in their experiments",
    "the authors used a `` triangular geometry '' : two sides of a triangle with slits were employed to inject and detect electron beams , the third side was utilized as a barrier .",
    "an external magnetic field transverse to the 2d plane of the heterostructure was used to direct the reflected beams to the detecting slit .",
    "a theoretical description of these experiments was presented mostly in ref .",
    "the authors assumed that the spin splitting of electron energies due to the soi had two origins : the structural asymmetry of the quantum well and the barrier .",
    "however , it was then incorrectly concluded that the bychkov - rashba spin splitting of electron energies due to the asymmetric well was proportional to the electric field in the conduction band and that the spin splittings caused by the two origins were governed by the same material parameter . a calculation of spin splitting due to the so interaction of unbound electrons with the barrier was not attempted .",
    "teodorescu and winkler [ 17 ] in their analysis of spin - dependent reflections from an impenetrable barrier used as an origin of the bychkov - rashba spin splitting only the inversion asymmetry of the well .",
    "also in the work on the spin separation in 2d cyclotron motion ( ref .",
    "18 ) and transverse electron focusing in 2d systems with the soi ( ref .",
    "19 ) , the bychkov - rashba splitting for unbound electrons was taken into account only phenomenologically .",
    "it should be emphasized that , as follows from our eq .",
    "( 23 ) and ref .",
    "2 , the bychkov - rashba splitting for unbound and bound electrons bear some similarities but are also marked by important differences . in both cases",
    "it is necessary to have the soi and structure inversion asymmetry . in both cases",
    "it is necessary to have a transverse motion and the resulting spin splitting is proportional to the transverse momentum .",
    "on the other hand , for the unbound electrons the spin splitting depends on the longitudinal momentum @xmath237 , while for the bound electrons this momentum is `` frozen '' in the electron wave function of the quantum well and it does not explicitly appear . also , as follows from eqs .",
    "( 23 ) and ( 24 ) , for the unbound electrons even the functional forms of @xmath38 are different for @xmath112 and @xmath124 situations .",
    "we described spin - conserving and spin - flip opaque reflections of 2d electrons from a barrier in insb / inalsb heterostructure .",
    "in such a system the electric field of the barrier is the only source of spin splitting in the presence of spin - orbit interaction .",
    "formulas for the bychkov - rashba spin splitting are calculated for unbound electrons .",
    "angles and amplitudes are calculated for reflected and penetrating electron beams .",
    "two unexpected possibilities are predicted due to the spin - orbit interaction : a ) non - attenuated electron propagation in the barrier when the latter is higher than the kinetic energy of incoming electrons , b ) total reflection of electrons whose energies exceed barrier s height .",
