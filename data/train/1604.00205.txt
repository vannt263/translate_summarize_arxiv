[ maps ] ) . taken at face value , the tilt between both axes indicates that strong non - circular motions are superposed to the _ slow _ rotation pattern of the co torus .",

    "the remarkably lopsided distribution and complex kinematics of the @xmath101  pc co torus of seen by alma could be the footprint of the ppi in this seyfert . alternatively , the velocity gradient observed along the minor axis could be explained by gas being entrained in the outflow , as similarly detected by @xcite in high - ionization lines close to the agn .",
