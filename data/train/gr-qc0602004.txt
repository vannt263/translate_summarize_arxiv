    "that the world exhibits exact lorentz invariance is a central hypothesis of modern physics , and as such , warrants scrutiny .",
    "interest in testing this hypothesis has been growing in recent years .",
    "this is likely due to hints that this symmetry may be broken in various candidates for theories of quantum gravity and models of physics beyond the planck scale , including strings  @xcite , loop quantum gravity  @xcite , and noncommutative field theories  @xcite .",
    "the review  @xcite discusses various theoretical models that feature lorentz - symmetry violating effects and observational searches for violations .",
    "if we wish to incorporate lorentz violation into a gravitational setting , we must employ a mechanism that breaks this symmetry while preserving the distinct symmetry of diffeomorphism invariance .",
    "aether theory is a variation of general relativity ( gr ) that does just this .",
    "aether theory , or ` ae - theory ' for short , is a classical , vector - tensor theory of gravity in which the vector field ` aether ' is constrained to be everywhere timelike and of fixed norm .",
    "the aether can be thought of as an effective remnant of unknown , planck scale , lorentz - violating physics .",
    "it defines a  preferred \" frame , while its status as a dynamical field preserves diffeomorphism invariance .",
    "the condition on the vector norm ( which can always be scaled to unity ) ensures that the aether just picks out a preferred direction and removes instabilities in the unconstrained theory ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "a review of properties of this theory and references to earlier work , can be found in  @xcite .    much work on ae - theory has focused on deriving observational constraints on the theory s free parameters , denoted here as @xmath0 .",
    "recent efforts have determined the form of the theory s post - newtonian expansion and the nature of linear , source free wave phenomena , and have demonstrated that the theory remains observationally healthy for a large range of @xmath1 values .",
    "the parameterized post - newtonian ( ppn ) expansion  @xcite describes weak field , slow motion gravitational effects in terms of ten parameters that depend on the theory s free parameters .",
    "the ppn parameters have been constrained by solar system based tests to have the values predicted by gr , up to small errors . in ae - theory , only two of the ten parameters , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , differ from the gr values  @xcite .",
    "these can be set to their gr values of zero by special choice of two of the four @xmath1 .",
    "the propagation of plane waves on a flat metric , constant aether background was examined in  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that there generally exist five independent wave modes  two spin-2 , two spin-1 , and one spin-0that travel at three different speeds that depend on the @xmath1 .",
    "the energy densities associated with these modes were derived in  @xcite and also depend on the @xmath1 .",
    "constraints on the @xmath1 are then imposed by the requirements that @xmath2 and @xmath3 vanish , and that wave modes have positive energy densities and real speeds .",
    "another constraint arises from imposing superluminal speeds , which is required to a first approximation by the absence of vacuum erenkov radiation of gravity - aether shock waves  @xcite .",
    "yet another constraint can be derived from primordial nucleosynthesis  @xcite .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that all of these constraints are satisfied by a large two parameter family of ae - theories .",
    "additional tests of ae - theory can come from the study of stellar solutions and black holes , begun in  @xcite , and from the  ultimate \" test  @xcite provided by observations of binary pulsar systems .",
    "this work begins that examination with a calculation of the generation of gravity - aether radiation by a nearly newtonian source and the subsequent energy loss , or radiation damping , of the source .",
    "a formula is derived for the rate of change of energy : [ rate1 ] = -g_n , where @xmath4 is the trace - free quadrupole moment of the source , @xmath5 is the trace of the second moment , @xmath6 is a dipolar quantity defined below , and @xmath7 and @xmath8 are dimensionless combinations of the @xmath1 ; @xmath9 is the value of newton s constant that one would measure far from an external gravitating source ; the angular brackets indicate a time average over a period of the system s motion .",
    "this formula generalizes the  quadrupole \" formula of standard general relativity , which predicts a similar expression but with @xmath10 , @xmath11 .    in the case of a system of two compact bodies ,",
    "this expression takes the form [ rate2 ] = -g_n , where @xmath12 is the reduced mass of the system , @xmath13 the total mass , @xmath14 the relative velocity of the bodies , and @xmath15 their orbital separation , which i assume is much larger than the size @xmath16 of the bodies ; @xmath17 is the difference in self - gravitational binding energy per unit mass of the bodies , and the coefficient @xmath18 is another dimensionless combination of the @xmath1 .",
    "this expression gives the lowest - order effects in a post - newtonian ( pn ) ( weak field , slow motion ) expansion .",
    "aside from the @xmath19 prefactor , the first two terms are @xmath20 and the last is @xmath21 . it does not take into account strong field effects that may be important when the fields are not weak inside a given body",
    ". the strength of the field of a compact body can be characterized by the quantity @xmath22 ; this is  small \" for the sun ( @xmath23 ) or a typical white dwarf ( @xmath24 ) , and  large \" for a typical neutron star ( @xmath25 ) or black hole ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "thus , the field should be strong within the systems actually used to measure the damping rate .",
    "strong field effects on the damping rate of a compact body can be associated with a dependence of the body s gravitating mass on the ambient non - metric fields  that is , with a violation of the strong equivalence principle  @xcite .",
    "these effects are not present in gr at lower post - newtonian orders . their presence in ae - theory will be examined in future work  @xcite .",
    "the damping rate can be tested by observing the rate of change of the orbital period @xmath27 of various binary systems , since @xmath28 , equating the energy radiated to minus the change in mechanical energy of the system . in practice , this test is conjoined with tests of other  post - keplerian \" ( pk ) parameters  @xcite , in particular the rate of advance of periastron ( the point at which the two objects are closest to each other ) and the redshift or time delay due to the gravitational field of the system .",
    "these  quasi - static \"  @xcite parameters are determined by the post - newtonian forms of the fields and the effective equations of motion for the compact bodies .",
    "the conjoint technique is necessary , because the expressions for the pk parameters depend on the unknown masses of the systems bodies .",
    "the expressions for the parameters will depend on the two masses , other measurable parameters , and a given theory s free parameters .",
    "measurement of three mass dependent parameters , for fixed values of the theory parameters , gives three bands with widths due to errors in the two - dimensional space of mass values .",
    "the theory is consistent for those values of the free parameters if the bands overlap .",
    "the predictions of gr have been validated in this way using data from various binary systems containing pulsars , whose regular pulsing provides an accurate measuring device ; see the review  @xcite for details .    for ae - theory",
    ", i find that if one assumes the strong field effects are negligible so that the results below are adequate , then there exists a one - parameter family of theories that satisfy all of the constraints summarized in  @xcite , and whose predictions for the pk parameters match those of gr to the order worked to here .",
    "this can be seen as follows .",
    "to lowest pn order and neglecting strong field effects , the quasi - static parameters can be determined within the ppn framework  @xcite .",
    "consequently , when @xmath2 and @xmath3 are set to zero , so that all of the ae - theory ppn parameters match those of gr , the two theories will make the same predictions for the quasi - static parameters . in this case",
    ", the @xmath1 can be constrained by requiring that the damping rate equal that of gr .",
    "but as shown below , the radiated fields contain only quadrupolar contributions when @xmath2 and @xmath3 are set to zero .",
    "the damping rates then coincide when @xmath29 is set to one , which can be done by imposing one condition on the two remaining free @xmath1 . to be consistent with the observational tests summarized in  @xcite ,",
    "this curve of theories must intersect with the allowed two - parameter family demarcated there ( and below in sec .",
    "[ five ] ) .",
    "this is the case all along the curve , as long as @xmath30 .",
    "the calculation will proceed as follows . in sec .  [",
    "two ] , a weak field expansion of the field equations is performed .",
    "the perturbations are shown to satisfy the wave equation , with matter terms and nonlinear terms acting as sources . in sec .",
    "[ three ] , these equations are solved via integration of the sources with green s functions .",
    "the source integrals are approximated in terms of time derivatives of moments of the sources , and evaluated to order of interest using the ppn expansion of the fields . in sec .  [ four ] , an expression for the rate of change of energy contained within a volume of space is defined , and evaluated in terms of the wave forms .",
    "i will conclude with a discussion of the constraints on the @xmath1 implied by observations from binary pulsars , in sec .",
    "[ five ] .",
    "i use the conventions of  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the metric signature is @xmath31 .",
    "this differs from the published version of this article  @xcite ; however , this signature is vastly more convenient for performing calculations involving a time - space decomposition , and should have been used from the start .",

    "in this section , i will expand the ae - theory field equations about a flat metric , constant aether background , obtaining a set of wave equations with matter terms and nonlinear terms as sources .",
    "i begin with the standard four - parameter ae - theory action @xmath41 [ act5 ] s = d^4x ( r - k^ab_cd_a u^c _ b u^d + ( u^a u^b g_ab + 1 ) ) , where k^ab_cd = ( c_1 g^abg_cd + c_2^a_c^b_d + c_3^a_d^b_c -c_4 u^a u^b g_cd ) .",
    "the sign of the @xmath42 term looks awkward , but it allows for easy comparison between results in this version of the article and in the published version  @xcite .",
    "i will use shorthand for certain combinations of the @xmath1 : c_14 = c_1 - c_4,c_123 = c_1 + c_2 + c_3 , c _ = c_1 c_3 .",
    "in addition to the ae - theory action , there is an aether - independent matter action .",
    "the matter can be assumed to couple universally to some metric since lorentz - violating effects in nongravitational interactions are already highly constrained  @xcite .",
    "aether couplings are then excluded from the matter action , and the field @xmath43 is identified as this universal metric .",
    "the resulting equations of motion consist of the einstein equations [ eeq5 ] g_ab - s_ab = 8 g t_ab , where g_ab = r_ab -r g_ab ,    s_ab = & _ c ( k^c_(a u_b ) + k_(ab)u^c - k_(a^cu_b ) ) + & + c_1(_a u_c_b u^c - _ c u_a^c u_b ) + c_4(u^c_c u_a ) ( u^d_d u_b ) + & + u_a u_b - g_ab ( k^c_d_c u^d ) ,    with k^a_c = k^ab_cd_b u^d , and @xmath44 is the matter stress tensor .",

    "second , spherical symmetry of each body implies that @xmath123 , where ( _ a)_ij -g_n_a d^3 xd^3 x , and _ a = ( _ a)_ii = -_a d^3x |u_a .",
    "third , staticity of each body implies that @xmath124 , and similarly for @xmath125 .",
    "these facts imply that v_i = 3w_i = -2 _ a ( v_a)^i _ a , plus terms of @xmath126 . therefore , to interesting order , [ mmm ] _",
    "i = -(_1 - _ 2 ) _ a ( v_a)^i _ a.      i can now express the nonstatic , radiation - zone fields , to desired accuracy . for spin-2 , _",

    "i now turn to the expression for the rate of change of energy contained within a volume of space .",
    "such an expression can be derived via the noether charge method for defining the total energy of an asymptotically - flat space - time  @xcite , using the ae - theory noether current derived in  @xcite .",
    "one can equivalently work in terms of pseudotensors , using the results of  @xcite .",
    "following the discussion in the appendix of  @xcite , an expression for the total energy @xmath129 contained in a volume of space , for a theory linearized about a flat background , is given by the integral over that volume of a certain differential 3-form @xmath130 .",

    ",    where all indices on @xmath46 are raised with the flat metric @xmath139 .",
    "i will presume that only the time average of the damping rate need be determined .",
    "it is then crucial to note that the damping rate is calculated to lowest nonvanishing pn order by treating the system as exactly newtonian .",
    "the motion of the system can then be decomposed into a uniform translation of the center of mass  recall the conservation of @xmath140and a fixed keplerian orbit in the center - of - mass frame . as indicated below",
    ", the field wave forms do not depend on the center - of - mass motion .",
    "it then follows that if the time average is taken over an orbital period , total time derivatives in   do not contribute .",
    "it is also useful to note that approximation of the source integrals   implies that to @xmath94 , [ zones ] _ , j = -(1/s ) ^j , for field @xmath141 satisfying the sourced wave equation  .",
    "this relation then implies that 0 = ^i _ ij(x ) = ^i_i(x ) = ^i p_ij[(x ) ] .",
    "these facts permit manipulation of terms within the integral , e.g. : = = , where the angular brackets denote the time average .",
    "the energy loss rate then evaluates to [ edot ] = _ r dr^2 .",
    "the sign of the coefficient of the term for each spin is opposite to the sign of the energy density associated with linearized plane waves , as found in  @xcite .",
    "thus , a positive energy mode implies energy loss due to radiation of that mode .",
    "the energy loss rate can be further evaluated by substituting in the expressions for the fields given in sec .",
    "[ waveform ] , and performing the angular integral , using the results d _",

    "i_i = ( ( ) ^2 ( _ ij_ij ) + ( _ i_i ) ) , d = ( ) ^2 ( ( _ ij_ij ) + z^2(i i ) + ( _ i_i ) ) , substituted into expression   gives [ eee ] = -g_n , where @xmath142 where @xmath143 is given in  .",
    "this constitutes the generalization to ae - theory of the quadrupole formula of general relativity , and contains additional contributions from monopolar and dipolar sources .",
    "the presence of the monopolar term means that a spherically symmetric source , such as a spherically pulsating star , can radiate at this lowest nontrivial pn order in the presence of the aether , whereas it would not in pure gr . in this case ,",
    "@xmath144 , and as observed above , @xmath145 .",
    "only the spin-0 radiation fields are nonvanishing , and the energy loss rate is @xmath146 .",
    "bounds discussed in sec .",
    "[ five ] , however , require that the ppn parameters @xmath2   and @xmath3  , hence @xmath147  , vanish for observationally viable ae - theories .    for a binary system , treating the two bodies as static and spherically symmetric in their own rest frames leads to",
    "_ ij = - ( 4 _ ( iv_j ) - 3 _ i _ j ) , where @xmath148 , @xmath149 , @xmath150 is the relative separation and @xmath151 .",

    "i , where @xmath17 is the difference in binding energy per unit rest mass : = - .",
    "therefore , [ eeb ] = -g_n .",
    "i will now discuss bounds on the @xmath1 that can be derived by imposing the observational constraints summarized in  @xcite and by comparing the damping rate prediction   with measurements of binary pulsar systems .",
    "the four @xmath1 can be reduced to one free parameter by requiring that the ppn parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 vanish , and that the damping rate coincide with that of gr to lowest order .",
    "the theory will then satisfy all solar system based tests ; it is not correct , however , to say that it would pass the binary pulsar test .",
    "this is because the fields inside a neutron star pulsar or black hole companion are not weak , and strong field corrections to the quasi - static parameters may arise .",
    "nevertheless , the weak field results are adequate for small enough @xmath1 , as discussed in  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is useful to check whether this curve of ae - theories intersects the region allowed by positive energy , real frequency , vacuum erenkov , and nucleosynthesis constraints .",
    "the ppn parameters @xmath2   and @xmath3   for ae - theory were determined in  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that they can be set to zero , so that all of the ae - theory ppn parameters coincide with those of gr , with the choices [ condition5 ] c_2 = - , c_4 = - .",
    "the positive energy , real frequency , vacuum erenkov , and nucleosynthesis constraints can then be satisfied if @xmath152 and @xmath153 lie within the region [ region ] 0 < c_+ < 1 , 0 < c_- < .",
    "when @xmath2 and @xmath3 vanish , so does @xmath143   hence @xmath147  , and @xmath6 .",
    "the fields then contain only a quadrupole contribution , and the ae - theory damping rate   will match that of gr when @xmath10 . solving numerically shows that a solution curve exists in @xmath154 space that intersects the allowed region   for all positive values of @xmath155 ; see figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "thus , there exists a one - parameter family of ae - theories which satisfy all of the constraints summarized in  @xcite , and which predict a damping rate identical in the weak field limit to that of gr .",
    "observational error allows this curve to be widened into a band .",
    "as explained in the introduction , the standard method of measuring radiation damping is to observe the rate of change of orbital period @xmath156 of a binary system  @xcite , which will be proportional to @xmath157 .",
    "the smallest relative observational uncertainty in @xmath156 , which equates with the relative uncertainty in @xmath157 , is of order @xmath158 for the hulse - taylor binary b1913 + 16  @xcite .",
    "this uncertainty permits the band @xmath159 .",
    "numerical results indicate that at least for small @xmath160 , this band corresponds roughly to @xmath160 within about @xmath161 of the @xmath10 curve ."
