    "the birth of star - forming galaxies a few hundred million years after the big bang marks an important milestone in the history of our universe . the spectacular images returned by the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) in the past few years have already allowed us to probe into the first billion year of the universe .",
    "the last few years have also seen the development of an observationally testable theory of the formation of the first galaxies . as ongoing and upcoming observations , such as with the _ james webb space telescope _ ( _ jwst _ ) , are about to push to ever earlier times , approaching the epoch of the very first galaxies , this theory is put to ever more stringent tests ( for a review see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    both analytical arguments ( e.g.,@xcite ;",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ) and simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) suggest that the first stars have formed at @xmath2 inside dark matter minihalos with virial temperatures @xmath3 , corresponding to halo masses @xmath4 ( for a review , see @xcite ) . the metal - free primordial gas inside these minihalos cools and condenses to reach the high densities needed to form stars primarily through the radiative de - excitation of rovibrationally excited molecular hydrogen ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "as the minihalos grow in mass , their virial temperatures increase and , after reaching @xmath5 , become sufficiently large to collisionally excite atomic hydrogen .",
    "this gives birth to the first atomically cooling galaxies with typical masses @xmath6 at @xmath7 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "the first atomically cooling galaxies then evolve into the first dwarf galaxies with characteristic masses @xmath8 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the aim of the current work is to investigate the assembly of such galaxies under the radiative feedback from the first stars .",
    "the mass - scale marked by the first dwarf galaxies is closely related to a number of key open issues , some of which are outlined below .",
    "_ suppression of star formation by radiative feedback . _",
    "the radiation emitted by the first stars has a profound effect on subsequently forming stars and galaxies ( for a comprehensive overview , @xcite ) .",
    "radiation in the lyman - werner ( lw ) bands dissociates molecular hydrogen , the main coolant in minihalos ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "hydrogen - ionizing radiation heats the gas inside the first halos and the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "the associated increase in pressure drives the gas outside halos with virial temperatures @xmath9 , suppressing star formation in both minihalos and the first atomic cooling halos ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the increased pressure in the igm impedes the accretion of gas onto these low - mass halos , an effect known as jeans - filtering ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , star formation inside the first dwarf galaxies should be more robust to this negative radiative feedback as their deeper gravitational potentials allow them to hold on to their gas more strongly .    _ the sources of reionization .",
    "_ the first galaxies are thought to have started the reionization of the universe , which is the transformation of the cosmic hydrogen from its early neutral to its present ionized state that occurred during the first billion year after the big bang ( for reviews see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , whether galaxies could sustain reionization and drive it to completion is a question of significant debate ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the largest uncertainties are related to our poor knowledge of the escape fraction , i.e. , the fraction of ionizing photons that leave the galaxies unabsorbed and are thus available to reionize the igm , and of the abundance and ionizing luminosities of low - mass galaxies too faint to be detected in current surveys ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the most recent determinations of the uv luminosity density at @xmath10 suggest that a significant contribution from faint , yet to be observed , low - mass galaxies is likely needed to sustain reionization in the recombining gas ( @xcite ; see @xcite for a comprehensive discussion ) . because of their increased robustness against stellar feedback , dwarf galaxies are among the low - mass galaxies expected to be especially efficient sources of reionization ( e.g.,@xcite ; @xcite ) .    _ the origin of the milky way ( mw ) satellites .",
    "_ dissipationless simulations of dark matter subhalos around mw - like galaxies imply the existence of a large population of satellite galaxies only few of which are currently observed .",
    "a number of solutions have been offered to explain this missing satellite problem ( @xcite ; @xcite ; for reviews see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , including the suppression of star formation in low - mass halos by stellar feedback and reionization ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , the transformation of low - mass halos by tidal forces and ram - pressure stripping upon their entry in the mw virial region ( e.g. , @xcite ) , modifications of the cold dark matter structure formation paradigm ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and others ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , current theories still struggle to explain the abundance and properties of the observed mw satellites across the luminosity range , from the recently discovered ultra - faint to the long - known classical satellites ( e.g , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the most massive of the simulated mw dark matter subhalos have progenitors with masses @xmath11 at @xmath12 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests an intimate relation with the first dwarf galaxies , and renders investigations into these objects a promising tool to understand the origin of structure in galaxies such as the mw .",
    "_ the first disk galaxies .",
    "_ simulations of the first atomically cooling galaxies , i.e. , galaxies inside halos with masses @xmath13 at redshifts @xmath14 , reveal a highly irregular morphology of the halo gas ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . on the other hand , simulations of galaxies inside halos with larger masses @xmath8 and at lower redshifts @xmath15 often find the halo gas organized in rotationally supported disks ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these findings suggest a dwarf - size mass scale @xmath16 for the transition to disk - like morphologies , and the emergence of the first disk galaxies at @xmath17 .",
    "physical processes to imprint such a scale include the turbulence generated by the cold inflow of gas along filaments which characterizes gas accretion by the first atomic cooling halos ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and stellar feedback ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "whether the first halos may host disks is an important open issue , affecting estimates of , e.g. , the escape of ionizing photons into the igm ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , or the ability of massive black holes to accrete gas and grow ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "_ has so far revealed have estimated stellar masses @xmath18 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "future observations with upcoming telescopes such as the _ jwst _ will allow to search for galaxies down to still lower stellar masses and out to higher redshifts , thus promising to test our theories of the formation of the first stars and galaxies .",
    "however , most studies agree that even _ jwst _ will not be sensitive enough to detect the stellar radiation emitted from inside the minihalos and the first atomic cooling halos ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "_ jwst _ may detect the stellar radiation from some of these objects if they are gravitational lensed ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "but most of the stellar light collected by _ jwst _ from high redshifts is expected to come from dwarf galaxies more massive than the first atomically cooling galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .    motivated primarily by the exciting prospects for observations with the upcoming _ jwst _",
    ", we have previously presented cosmological simulations of a dwarf galaxy assembling inside a halo reaching @xmath19 at @xmath1 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the simulations were performed using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) technique and achieved high resolution by zooming in a select region around the galaxy . following the non - equilibrium chemistry and cooling of primordial gas , the simulations tracked the evolution of the dwarf galaxy starting from before its birth inside a minihalo .",
    "an intriguing outcome was the formation of a rotationally supported extended disk just prior to the final simulation redshift .",
    "however , our previous simulations did not account for star formation and the associated feedback .",
    "as explained above , stellar feedback has the potential to significantly affect the assembly of the gas inside low - mass halos .    in this study",
    "we present a new set of simulations similar to our previous simulations , but extending them by including star formation and radiation .",
    "we focus on the radiative feedback from lw and ionizing radiation . to judge the impact of radiative feedback we will compare a simulation that includes both lw and ionizing radiation with a simulation that includes only lw radiation and further with a simulation in which no radiation is emitted .",
    "note that the simulations do not account for supernova ( sn ) feedback or metal enrichment , a limitation we will discuss in section  [ sec : discussion ] below .",
    "the simulations are designed primarily to address the impact of radiative feedback on the assembly of the emerging dwarf galaxy , and on the formation of galactic disks inside it .",
    "however , we will also briefly discuss the impact of radiative feedback on the assembly of galaxies in the neighborhood of the simulated dwarf galaxy .",
    "our simulations enable us to provide an improved estimate of the observability of the first galaxies with _",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : numerics ] ( as well as in the appendix ) we describe our numerical techniques , and in section  [ sec : simulations ] we describe the set of simulations that we have carried out . in sections  [ sec : formation ] and [ sec :",
    "reionization ] we present the results of our simulations , subsequently discussing the assembly of the dwarf galaxy and the radiative feedback on the igm and the neighboring galaxies . in section",
    "[ sec : prospects ] we use the simulated star formation rates to estimate the observability of the first galaxies with _ jwst_. in section  [ sec : discussion ] we discuss our results and also address some of the most important limitations . in section  [ sec : summary ] , we summarize our work .    throughout this work",
    "we assume the @xmath20cdm cosmological model with parameters @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , which are consistent with the most recent analysis of the observations with the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ satellite ( @xcite ) .",
    "distances are expressed in physical ( i.e. , not comoving ) units , unless noted otherwise .",
    "we will make use of the species number density fractions with respect to hydrogen @xmath23 , where @xmath24 labels the chemical species .",
    "in this section we describe the numerical techniques employed . the simulations presented below are identical to the simulations described in @xcite , except for the inclusion of star formation and dissociating and ionizing radiation .",
    "we will therefore only briefly review the simulation techniques already used in @xcite .",
    "we will focus on the description of the techniques used to model the formation of stars and the dissociative and ionizing impact of stellar radiation on the gas .",
    "we remind the reader that the simulations do not account for sn feedback or metal enrichment , as discussed further in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we use a modified version of the @xmath25-body / treepm smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code gadget ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) to perform a suite of zoomed cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of the assembly of a halo that reaches a virial mass @xmath26 at redshift @xmath1 .",
    "the simulations are initialized at redshift @xmath27 in a box of size @xmath28 .",
    "initial particle positions and velocities are obtained by applying the zeldovich approximation ( @xcite ) to particles arranged on a cartesian grid .",
    "we adopt a transfer function for matter perturbations generated with cmbfast  ( version 4.1 ; @xcite ) .",
    "we first perform a low - resolution simulation without star formation down to redshift @xmath1 , and locate the most massive halo , with virial mass @xmath26 and virial radius @xmath29 .",
    "we then trace the particles found within @xmath30 from the most bound particle of this halo back to their locations at the start of the simulation .",
    "we hierarchically refine the initial particle setup using a nested sequence of cubical patches ( `` zooms '' ) centered on the traced particles , inside which we increase the mass resolution by successive factors of 8 with each increasing level of zoom . in the zoom with the highest mass resolution , which entirely contains the traced particles and which we refer to as the refinement region , gas ( dark matter ) particles have masses @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "the simulations are performed with the gravitational forces softened over a sphere of plummer - equivalent radius @xmath33 applied to all particles .",
    "the particle dynamical variables , such as position , velocity , and density , are evolved in time using individual particle gravito - hydrodynamical time steps determined by the smaller of the dynamical time step and the courant time step ( e.g. , equation  16 in @xcite ) , which is the standard gadget time stepping scheme .",
    "we do not explicitly limit the particle gravito - hydrodynamical time steps by either the chemical time or the radiative cooling or radiative heating time .",
    "however , chemistry , radiative cooling and radiative heating described below are solved by subcycling the smallest gravito - hydrodynamical time step among all particles in the simulation on the relevant time scales ( see appendix  [ sec : coupling ] ) .",
    "we assume that the gas is of primordial composition with hydrogen mass fraction @xmath34 and a helium mass fraction @xmath35 .",
    "we use a modified version of the implicit solver dvode ( @xcite ) to follow the non - equilibrium chemistry and cooling of @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath37 , and @xmath42 , and we include @xmath43 and @xmath44 assuming their collisional equilibrium abundances ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we consider all relevant radiative cooling processes : cooling by collisional ionization , collisional excitation of atomic and molecular lines , the emission of free - free and recombination radiation , and compton cooling by the cmb .",
    "once stars form and emit radiation , the chemical and thermal evolution of the gas is also affected by the photodissociation of molecular hydrogen and deuterium , and photoionization of hydrogen and helium , as we describe in sections  [ sec : dissociation ] and [ sec : ionization ] below .",
    "it should be kept in mind that at high gas densities , a jeans floor employed to avoid artificial fragmentation artificially increases the gas temperature and affects the distribution and dynamics of the gas ( see equation  1 in @xcite ) .",
    "star formation is a complex astrophysical phenomenon , many details of which remain to be understood ( for a review see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in the mw and in nearby galaxies ,",
    "star formation is observed to occur inside a hierarchy of clouds with masses @xmath45 .",
    "the clouds are transformed into stars at a rate @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the star formation time scale , @xmath48^{1/2}$ ] the free fall time at the characteristic density @xmath49 of the star - forming clouds , and @xmath50 the star formation efficiency per free fall time .",
    "star formation is observed to be a slow process with a typical efficiency per free fall time of only @xmath51 , independent of the characteristic densities of the star - forming clouds in the range @xmath52 ( @xcite ) .",
    "while gas masses @xmath45 that characterize star - forming clouds in the nearby universe are resolved , our simulations lack the resolution and physical detail to follow the formation of individual stars . hence",
    ", we can not exploit our simulations to estimate the star formation rates ( sfrs ) inside individual star - forming clouds from first principles .",
    "instead , we adopt a phenomenological model that specifies how quickly gas turns into stars .",
    "the model is motivated by and consistent with investigations of star formation in the nearby universe .",
    "prescriptions for treating star formation in simulations of high - redshift galaxies are commonly calibrated with relations obtained from the local universe .",
    "this practice is necessitated by the current lack of direct observations of star formation at high redshifts .",
    "the phenomenological approach is sufficient to allow us to investigate the effect of stellar dissociating and photoionizing radiation on the interstellar gas and the igm .",
    "we restrict star formation to occur only in regions with gas densities exceeding a threshold density , @xmath53 , where we set @xmath54 .",
    "this is somewhat lower than the densities @xmath55 of metal - free clouds on the verge of collapse to form stars ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is also lower than the similar densities of metal - free clouds able to shield their @xmath56 from external dissociating radiation ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "because our simulations focus on the assembly of galaxies inside more massive halos , we must adopt , for reasons of computational viability , a lower resolution than employed in these previous works , preventing us from adopting still larger star formation threshold densities .",
    "our choice for the star formation threshold density is close to the lowest threshold density @xmath57 explored by @xcite above which the time of the formation of the first star formed inside high - redshift minihalos was found to be insensitive to an increase in the threshold density ( see also , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we adopt a star formation time scale that depends solely on the threshold density for star formation @xmath58 , @xmath59 where we have set @xmath60 .",
    "hence , the star formation time scale is independent of the gas density @xmath53",
    ". this amounts to assuming that all star formation occurs inside clouds with characteristic density @xmath61 , and is consistent with both our limited resolution and the observations in the nearby universe .",
    "a similar star formation recipe using a density - independent star formation time has been employed in , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "however , we caution that the sfrs of simulated galaxies depend on the specific choice for the value of the star formation efficiency , at least unless star formation is self - regulated by feedback ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .    our numerical implementation of the star formation law is identical to that of @xcite .",
    "the star formation law is interpreted stochastically , and the probability that a star - forming gas particle is turned into a star particle in a time interval @xmath62 is given by @xmath63 .",
    "gas particles are converted to star particles assuming a conversion efficiency of 100% , i.e. , the masses of the star particles are identical to those of the gas particles from which they are formed .",
    "the implied relatively large mass of star particles is consistent with our resolution , but sets a lower limit on the stellar mass fractions and hence ionizing and lw luminosities in the simulated galaxies to which the effects of radiative feedback may be sensitive .",
    "we impose an upper limit @xmath64 on the temperature at which gas is allowed to form stars , where @xmath65 is the minimum temperature set by the jeans floor .",
    "we interpret the star particles in our simulations as simple stellar populations , i.e. , instantaneous stellar bursts that are characterized by an initial mass function ( imf ) , metallicity , and age .",
    "we compute the time - dependent hydrogen and helium ionizing luminosities @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 , as well as the luminosities @xmath69 in the lw band with energies @xmath70 , of these star formation bursts using the population synthesis models from @xcite .",
    "the models assume a power - law imf @xmath71 with the @xcite exponent @xmath72 but allow for a variation of the range of the stellar masses sampled from the power - law distribution .",
    "we describe the stellar bursts using the @xcite zero metallicity models with initial masses in the range @xmath73 .",
    "the age of a burst is the time difference between the simulation time at which the star particle was created and the current simulation time . for reference ,",
    "the luminosities at zero age main sequence are @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 .",
    "we only consider star particles inside the refinement region , and we do not follow the propagation of radiation outside this region .      molecular hydrogen @xmath36 and deuterated hydrogen hd",
    "are photodissociated upon absorption of radiation in the lw band belonging to the photon energy range @xmath78 .",
    "the rate of photodissociation of @xmath36 is ( e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the characteristic lw frequency , @xmath81 is the lw flux , @xmath82 is the normalized lw mean intensity , and @xmath83 .",
    "we set the rate for photodissociation of hd identical to that of @xmath36 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we write the lw intensity @xmath84 as the sum of the cosmological lw background intensity @xmath85 and the local lw intensity @xmath86 produced by the stellar populations represented by the star particles in the refinement region of our simulations , @xmath87 .",
    "the refinement region is too small to follow the build - up of the cosmological lw background in a self - consistent manner .",
    "we therefore treat the intensity of the lw background as a free parameter , and approximate its evolution using @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the intensity of the lw background at @xmath90 . setting @xmath91 and @xmath92 , equation  ( [ eq : lw ] ) provides a good fit to the lw background evolution presented in figure 1 of @xcite , and is also consistent with computations of the lw background in other works ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the use of a lw background that is a fixed function of redshift does not allow us to capture the effects of self - regulation of star formation inside minihalos by lw feedback ( e.g. , @xcite ) , at least until the intensity of lw radiation emitted by the stars inside the simulation box has become higher than the intensity of the background .    for reasons of computational efficiency",
    "we determine the contributions from the @xmath93 star particles in the refinement region to the intensity @xmath94 evaluated at the location of gas particle @xmath95 in the optically thin approximation ( e.g. , @xcite ) , i.e. , @xmath96 or , in units of @xmath97 , @xmath98 here , @xmath99 is the photon luminosity of star particle @xmath100 per unit mass in the lw frequency band , @xmath101 is the width of the lw band , @xmath102 planck s constant , @xmath103 the mass of star particle @xmath100 , and @xmath104 the distance between the gas and the star particle .",
    "for simplicity , we approximate the time - dependent lw luminosities @xmath69 computed in section  [ sec : popsyn ] by their zero age main sequence values , and we assume that the stars emit lw radiation for @xmath105 ( @xcite ) . we approximately account for radiative transfer ( rt ) effects by attenuating the total lw intensity @xmath84 by a local self - shielding factor ( equation  10 in @xcite with @xmath106 ) .",
    "the self - shielding factor depends on the column density of molecular hydrogen , which we compute in the local jeans approximation ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    when computing the contribution to the lw intensity from local sources using equation  ( [ eq : lwlocal ] ) , we ignore the absorption of lw radiation along the way to the absorbing gas particle . near emitters ,",
    "this is justified because molecular hydrogen is efficiently collisionally dissociated inside the regions surrounding them ( @xcite ; but see @xcite ) .",
    "outside the regions , this approximation is good as long as the intergalactic molecular hydrogen fraction does not substantially exceed its primordial value , @xmath107 . in this case ,",
    "the optical depth for absorption in the lw band remains insignificant out to distances @xmath108 ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their figure  12 ) ; see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their figure  7 ) ; @xcite ) much larger than the size of the refinement region . finally , we also ignore the absorption of lw photons by atomic hydrogen series lines , which also is not significant on the small scales simulated here ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "our implementation of photodissociation is similar to that in @xcite , but we do not account for the photo - detachment of h@xmath109 .",

    "this implementation involves two main steps .",
    "first , we transport ionizing photons radially from the star particles through the simulation box , and compute the fraction of the photons absorbed by atomic hydrogen and helium .",
    "second , we infer the associated photoionization and photoheating rates . here",
    "we will only give a brief overview .",
    "we present a detailed description of the implementation of the rt and the computation of the photoionization and photoheating rates in the appendix . there",
    "we will also discuss tests of this implementation .",
    "the coupling of the rt with the hydrodynamical evolution is achieved by passing the photoionization and photoheating rates , along with the photodissociation rates described in the previous section , to the non - equilibrium solver for the chemical and thermal evolution of the gas described in section  [ sec : cooling ] , and this coupling is described in appendix  [ sec : coupling ] .",
    "we transport the ionizing radiation emitted by the star particles using the multi - frequency rt code traphic(@xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "traphic  solves the time - dependent rt equation by tracing photon packets emitted by source particles at the speed of light and in a photon - conserving manner through the simulation box .",
    "the photon packets are transported directly on the spatially adaptive , unstructured grid traced out by the sph particles , which allows one to exploit the full dynamic range of the sph simulations .",
    "a directed radial transport of the photon packets from the sources is accomplished despite the irregular distribution of sph particles by guiding the photon packets inside cones .",
    "a photon packet merging technique renders the computational cost of the rt independent of the number of ionizing sources .",
    "the transport of photons is discretized in rt time steps @xmath114 , after each of which the chemical and thermal evolution of the gas is advanced based on the number of absorbed photons .",
    "we make the following approximations specific to the current work .",
    "each star particle emits ionizing photon packets to its neighboring sph particles once per rt time step in a set of tessellating emission cones centered around 8 different directions .",
    "the effective angular sampling of the surrounding volume is larger than implied by this number of directions thanks to the splitting of photon packets among neighbors inside the same emission cone , and because of the randomization of the emission directions at each rt time step .",
    "the photons are transported radially away from the star particles by tracing them downstream inside transmission cones with solid angle @xmath115 .",
    "this angular resolution is sufficiently high to track the delay of the ionization fronts around individual halos by dense filaments , giving rise to the typical `` butterfly '' shape of ionized regions , as shown in figure  [ fig : firststar ] .    to reduce the computational cost , we limit the propagation of photons to at most a single inter - particle distance per rt time step , which approximates the full time - dependent rt in the limit of small rt time steps .",
    "ionizing photons are transported using a single frequency bin , and the absorption of the photons by neutral hydrogen and neutral and singly ionized helium is computed in the grey approximation .",
    "the grey approximation does not allow us to capture effects of spectral hardening , and hence we may underestimate the effects of photoionization and photoheating near and ahead of ionization fronts , such as the enhanced formation of molecular hydrogen ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these approximations are discussed in further detail in the appendix , in particular in appendix  [ sec : parameters ] .",
    "we employ a set of three simulations to study the effects of radiative feedback on the assembly of high - redshift galaxies .",
    "lw+rt _ includes both star formation and the lw and ionizing radiation emitted by the stars , as well as an imposed lw radiation background , as described in section  [ sec : numerics ] .",
    "we will focus on discussing results of this simulation .",
    "we will often present our results by comparing this simulation with simulation _ lw _ , which is identical except that the emission of ionizing radiation is disabled , and with simulation _ nofb _ , in which the emission of lw radiation is also disabled . in the last simulation , gas forms stars , but these stars do not emit radiation , and in addition , the intensity of the assumed lw background is set to zero .",
    "this simulation is therefore identical to simulation _",
    "z4 _ reported in @xcite , except for the inclusion of star formation .",
    "important parameters of the simulations presented here are summarized in table  [ tbl : params ] .",
    "the final redshift of the simulations is @xmath116 .",
    "we note that simulations _",
    "lw _ and _ nofb _ are identical to the simulations used to estimate the detectability of pair instability supernovae in @xcite .",
    "we use the friends - of - friends ( fof ) halo finder , with linking parameter @xmath117 , built into the substructure finder subfind ( @xcite ) , to extract halos from our simulations . given a fof halo , we use subfind to identify its most bound particle and let it mark the halo center .",
    "we then obtain the virial radius , defined as the radius of the sphere centered on the most bound particle within which the average matter density is equal to @xmath118 times the redshift - dependent critical density of the universe .",
    "the total mass inside this sphere defines the halo virial mass .",
    "we define the total sfr of a given halo as the sum of the sfrs of the gas particles it contains .",
    "because we employ a stochastic star formation recipe , the rate at which star - forming gas particles are converted to star particles may randomly fluctuate around this sfr .",

    "the formation history is obtained by using subfind to locate the dwarf halo progenitor that contains most of the 50 most - bound particles of the dwarf halo at the final simulation redshift @xmath116 , and then repeating this procedure to find the progenitor of this progenitor and so on , tracing the halo assembly back to @xmath122 .",
    "the quantities displayed in figure  [ fig : assemblyhistory ] are obtained from the properties of the particles inside the virial radius .",

    "lw _ and _ nofb_.    during the first phase , and as the dark matter halo grows in mass and accretes gas , both the baryon fraction , which is initially slightly smaller than the cosmic baryon fraction @xmath127 , and the central gas densities increase . by @xmath122 , the molecular hydrogen fraction has significantly departed from its initial value , enabling the minihalo gas to cool efficiently .",
    "the average gas temperature inside the virial radius is initially slightly higher than the virial temperature ( dotted curve ) .",

    ", as the molecular hydrogen fraction builds up , this relation then reverses and the virial temperature becomes higher than the average gas temperature ( e.g. , @xcite ) . at @xmath128 ,",
    "the central gas densities become larger than the threshold density for star formation .",
    "a single gas particle is turned into a star particle , triggering the emission of lw and ionizing radiation from the associated stellar burst . at that time",
    ", the halo has reached a mass of @xmath129 .",
    "photoionization from the radiation emitted by the first stellar burst almost instantly increases the average gas temperatures to @xmath130 .",
    "the associated increase in thermal pressure pushes the gas away from the minihalo center , and removes a fraction of it from inside the virial radius . as a consequence",
    ", the baryon fraction is reduced to about @xmath131 .",
    "the reduction in the baryon fraction is consistent with but slightly smaller than that found in previous simulations of the assembly of minihalos under feedback from star formation ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this may be because the minihalo simulated here is fed by dense filaments , and the inflow of gas along these filaments provides a strong obstacle for photoheating to drive the gas beyond the virial radius , and it replenishes the photoevaporated regions with fresh gas ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , the reduction in the central gas mass is sufficient to drive the central gas densities below the threshold density for star formation , and the stellar burst shuts itself off .",
    "figure  [ fig : firststar ] shows images of the gas density , temperature , and ionized and molecular hydrogen fraction around the minihalo at the end of the stellar burst .",
    "after the first stellar burst is shut off , the average mass - weighted molecular hydrogen fraction approaches @xmath132 , as expected inside the relic region ( @xcite ) .",
    "the increased fraction of molecular hydrogen enables the gas to cool quickly , and the central gas densities increase .",
    "a few tens of myr after the end of the first burst , the gas has become sufficiently cold and dense for another stellar burst to be ignited ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "photoionization heating from this second burst again lowers the gas densities , but this time there is no strong decrease in the baryon fraction .",
    "the accreting minihalo is thus massive enough to retain most of the gas inside the virial region . because the negative feedback from photoheating is now less strong ,",
    "this second starburst is more extended in time than the first one , and it involves the conversion of several gas particles to star particles .",
    "however , the combined feedback from the stellar clusters represented by the star particles eventually shuts off star formation .",
    "but already a few tens of myr later the central gas densities have again increased above the sf threshold density , and the galaxy continues to form stars .    by redshift @xmath133 , the halo has reached virial temperatures @xmath134 .",
    "consequently , a significant fraction of the atomic hydrogen is collisionally excited , and its radiative de - excitation endows the gas with an additional channel to lose its thermal energy .",
    "feedback from photoionization heating continues to keep the gas inside the halo at relatively low densities . however , the galaxy now forms stars continuously , albeit at a rate significantly smaller than in the absence of radiative feedback . the comparison with the quickly rising sfrs in simulation _ lw _ that included emission of lw radiation but not that of ionizing photons shows that the feedback from the photodissociation of molecular hydrogen by lw radiation alone becomes inefficient in preventing the gas from forming stars as the halo mass approaches the atomic cooling limit , in good agreement with previous works ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . the transformation of the minihalo into an atomic cooling halo is accompanied by a significant decrease of the baryon fraction by @xmath135 at @xmath136 and in the specific angular momentum of the gas @xmath137 , where @xmath138 is the total gas angular momentum with respect to the motion of the most - bound particle and @xmath139 the total gas mass .    below @xmath140 ,",
    "photoionization heating becomes increasingly inefficient at reducing the density of the halo gas , and the gas then condenses up to @xmath141 . as a result , the expansion of regions is impeded by the increased recombination rates .",
    "the properties of the galaxy then become rapidly insensitive to the inclusion of ionizing radiation . the average mass - weighted ionized fraction , which has been increasing until then , remains roughly constant at around @xmath142 . as a result of the large densities , the sfrs approach those seen in the simulation without radiation .",
    "the average mass - weighted molecular hydrogen fraction reaches values in excess of @xmath143 as @xmath144 forms efficiently not only in fossil regions ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) but also in the ionization fronts of the regions under irradiation from the ionizing stars ( @xcite ; see also , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a major merger at redshift @xmath145 is accompanied by a strong increase in the specific angular momentum of the halo gas .",
    "the gas then settles in a disk , which is essentially in place at @xmath146 .",
    "the merger and the formation of this disk are shown in figure  [ fig : disksdensities ] , which display a sequence of snapshots of the gas density inside the forming dwarf galaxy .",
    "the disk is surrounded by a second larger - scale disk at @xmath147 .",
    "the evolution and the properties of these two disks will be discussed in more detail in section  [ sec : disks ] below .",
    "after the formation of the disks , the difference between virial and average gas temperatures that has amplified since the halo has become an atomic cooling halo continues to increase . in the atomic cooling halo",
    "this difference arises primarily because a fraction of the gas does not shock - heat to the virial temperature upon accretion onto the halo . instead",
    ", the gas can efficiently cool inside the dense filaments that reach into the virial region and supply the halo center with gas ( @xcite ) .",
    "a qualitatively similar difference between average and virial temperatures has been seen in other simulations of high - redshift low - mass galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . at @xmath116 , the final simulation redshift ,",

    "the central dark matter densities in the simulations that included ionizing and/or lw radiation ( solid curves in each of the bottom panels ) are initially significantly lower , by up to factors @xmath153 , than those in the simulation without radiation .",
    "the dark matter density profiles in these simulations thus do not follow a singular isothermal shape but show a spatially resolved dark matter `` core '' , extending to radii significantly larger than the gravitational softening scale ( left - most vertical lines ) .",
    "the reduction in the central dark matter densities is more distinct and exists down to lower redshifts in simulation _",
    "lw+rt _ than in simulation _",
    "lw_. the difference in the central dark matter densities originates in the difference in the distribution of the gas inside the assembling dwarf galaxy . in simulation",
    "lw _ , gas can not cool and condense as efficiently as in simulation _ nofb _ because molecular hydrogen , the main coolant in low - mass primordial galaxies , is photodissociated by lw radiation . in simulation _",
    "lw+rt _ , the central gas densities are , on average , further reduced as photoionization heating drives the gas away from the halo center .",
    "the radiative feedback on the distribution of baryons implies a significant change in the gravitational potential and , in turn , in the gravitational pull on the dark matter , which hence remains less centrally concentrated .",
    "the comparison of the dark matter density profiles in the simulations with and without feedback demonstrates that the ability of gas to cool and condense to high densities is crucial for establishing the singular isothermal density profile seen in the simulation without feedback ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "that gas condensation can lead to a more concentrated dark matter density distribution is well known and is usually described using the framework of halo contraction models ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "one may then expect the reverse of this process , i.e. , the removal of gas from the halo center , to lead to a reduction in the concentration of the dark matter .",
    "indeed , previous works have demonstrated the ability of sn explosions to lower the central dark matter densities in dwarf galaxies with masses @xmath154 at @xmath155 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "here we have shown that radiative feedback can have a qualitatively similar effect on the dark matter distribution in high - redshift minihalos .",
    "the reduction in the central dark matter densities due to radiative feedback is similar to that seen in the adaptive mesh refinement simulations of @xcite . in our simulation _",
    "lw+rt _ , the centrally suppressed dark matter profiles shown in the left panel of figure  [ fig : profiles ] can be approximated by a @xcite profile and concentration parameter @xmath156 at z = 18.5 and 15.5 .",
    "the effect of radiative feedback on the dark matter profiles of high - redshift low mass halos was also investigated by @xcite .",
    "the shape of dark matter profiles in a cosmological simulation including gas dynamics and radiative feedback was found to be similar , on average , to the shape in a simulation that was identical except that it only treated the dynamics of the dark matter .",
    "our finding that radiative feedback can counteract the effects of gas condensation on the dark matter density profile is consistent with the results in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite also points out that there are significant statistical variations in the shape of the dark matter profile of halos at fixed mass and redshift in the simulation that included gas physics .",
    "we therefore caution to overinterpret our conclusions drawn from the investigation of a single dwarf halo .",
    "+   +    figure  [ fig : disksdensities ] shows a sequence of snapshots of the gas density distribution centered on the dwarf galaxy in simulation _",
    "lw+rt_. at the final simulation redshift , the gas at the halo center is organized in a massive central , spherical clump , an inner compact disk , and an outer extended disk .",
    "the panels can be compared with figure  8 of @xcite , which shows the gas densities in our earlier simulation identical to simulation _",
    "lw+rt _ discussed here except that it did not include star formation or radiation .",
    "the comparison shows that the radiative feedback is weak and the inclusion of star formation and lw and ionizing radiation does not prevent the formation of the disks seen in that earlier simulation .",
    "the sequence of events leading to the formation of the two disks is very similar with and without the inclusion of radiation , and the reader may therefore refer to @xcite for additional details . a major merger at redshift @xmath140 channels gas in the halo center .",
    "this leads to the formation of the first gaseous disk by @xmath157",
    ". the disk subsequently develops spiral arms .",
    "the spiral arms exert torques that imply an outward transport of angular momentum in the disk gas . as a consequence ,",

    "the second disk surrounds the first disk , and the two have orientations tilted with respect to each other .",
    "this tilt is an interesting consequence of the hierarchical assembly of the emerging dwarf galaxy ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the formation redshifts of the disks are similar in all simulations and hence insensitive to the inclusion of radiation .",
    "photoheating creates low - density regions in the disk gas , leaving behind a disk morphology more complex than in the absence of photoheating ( compare , e.g. , the bottom right panel of figure  [ fig : disksdensities ] with the corresponding panel in figure  8 of @xcite ) .",
    "these regions remain , however , locally confined , and the disks remain , as a whole , intact and relatively unaffected by photoheating .",
    "this insensitivity of the gas to photoheating is consistent with the fact that at the time of formation of the disks , i.e. , at @xmath140 , the galaxy halo has already entered the atomic cooling regime .",
    "hence , its gravitational potential is sufficiently deep to confine photoheated gas in its interior .",
    "a positive feedback loop which consists of high gas densities confining the photoheated regions , allows the gas to collapse to increasingly higher densities , further confining the photoheated gas .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig : diskprofiles ] shows the toomre parameter , averaged in annular bins , of the disk gas at the final simulation redshift , @xmath159 , where @xmath160 is the adiabatic sound speed , @xmath161 the epicyclic frequency , and @xmath162 the angular velocity of the disk gas ( @xcite ) . in all three simulations @xmath163 at radii larger than the gravitational softening length , implying that the disk configuration is stable against fragmentation .",
    "note that the inclusion of lw and ionizing radiation increases disk stability by increasing the sound speed .",
    "the inclusion of ionizing radiation further helps to preserve the disks because photoheating evaporates the gas from the low mass halos merging with the dwarf galaxy . in the absence of feedback ,",
    "on the other hand , baryon - rich low mass halos that pass through the disks can disturb the disks significantly ( e.g. , figure  3 in @xcite ) .",
    "the middle and right panels of figure  [ fig : diskprofiles ] show spherically averaged profiles of the sfr surface densities ( middle ) , and the kennicutt - schmidt relation ( right ) , i.e. , the relation between sfr surface density and gas surface density , at the final simulation redshift .",
    "the kennicutt - schmidt relation is characterized by a power - law behavior and a suppression of star formation below gas surface densities @xmath164 .",
    "the suppression is a result of the star formation recipe , which limits star formation to densities above @xmath165 . at the final simulation redshift ,",
    "such densities are realized both in the central region and in the disks , and the galaxy shows a spatially extended morphology of star formation .",
    "in contrast , star formation in the galaxy before disk formation is limited to the central region ( see figure  [ fig : disksdensities ] ) .",
    "the kennicutt - schmidt power law behavior can be understood by writing @xmath166 , where @xmath167 is the gas consumption time .",
    "using @xmath168 ( equation  [ eq : starformationtimescale ] ) , we find , @xmath169 . this relation is shown with the dotted line in figure  [ fig : diskprofiles ] , and",
    "the results from the simulation are in close agreement with it .",
    "+    taken at face value , the large toomre q values that indicate stability against disk fragmentation seem inconsistent with the nonzero star formation rates of the disks .",
    "however , our simulations do not have sufficient resolution or the physical detail required to study fragmentation of the disks into individual stars .",
    "we have therefore employed a phenomenological model for star formation according to which stars form from gas with densities larger than the adopted threshold density for star formation , an approach employed in most galaxy formation simulations .",
    "it remains open if , at higher resolution or greater physical detail , the disks in our simulation would fragment to form stars , or if they would remain stable , possibly feeding a central massive black hole ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "addressing these issues in cosmological simulations such as the simulations here is computationally challenging .",
    "simulations of isolated disk galaxies have shown that star formation is slower in disks that are more stable as quantified by the smallest toomre q value in the disk ( @xcite ) .",
    "it may therefore be that star formation in high - redshift low - mass disk galaxies is less efficient than implied by our simulations .",

    "the feedback processes exerted by radiation are well - known and are briefly summarized here .",
    "lw radiation photodissociates molecular hydrogen , reducing the ability of low - mass halos to condense their gas .",
    "this suppresses star formation , providing a negative feedback ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "ionizing radiation photoheats the igm to @xmath5 , and the implied jeans filtering impedes the accretion of gas into halos with virial temperatures @xmath9 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , photoheating evaporates gas from low - mass halos and reduces the ability of gas to cool inside them ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . on the other hand , photoionization generates free electrons , which catalyze the formation of molecular hydrogen , thus increasing the ability of gas inside low - mass halos to cool and form stars ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "photoionization therefore provides both a negative and a positive feedback on star formation .",
    "a comprehensive overview of the effects of radiative feedback can be found in , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : start ] quantifies the ionization and thermal history ( left ) as well as the evolution of lw intensities and of the molecular hydrogen fraction ( right ) around the dwarf galaxy in simulation _ lw+rt _ ( blue curves ) . the neighborhood considered here is defined , for simplicity of geometry and to reduce boundary artifacts , as the sphere of comoving radius @xmath173 , where @xmath174 is the virial radius of the dwarf galaxy at @xmath1 .",
    "we center the sphere on the comoving position of the most - bound particle of this galaxy at @xmath1 , and this is the same position on which the slices in figure  [ fig : images ] are centered . the spherical neighborhood is contained in the refinement region at all redshifts .",

    "the fraction of the mass ionized ( dashed ) shows a qualitatively similar behavior , but it slightly decreases after @xmath140 and reaches @xmath176 at the final simulation redshift .",
    "the redshift below which the ionized fractions no longer increase is similar to the redshift at which the galaxy evolves into an atomically cooling object .",
    "the fraction of the mass ionized is initially close to but slightly larger than the fraction of the volume ionized , but this changes at @xmath177 after which the fraction of ionized mass becomes increasingly lower than the fraction of the ionized volume .",

    "the mass- and volume - weighted average gas temperature of the ionized gas , which we have defined here as gas with ionized hydrogen fraction @xmath178 , fluctuates between @xmath179 and @xmath180 , in good agreement with the results in figures  12 and 13 in @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : start ] shows that the ionization of the region around the main galaxy in simulation _",
    "lw+rt _ is accompanied by an increase in the average lw intensities . before the formation of the first star ,",
    "the average lw intensity is close to but slightly smaller than the intensity of the imposed lw background ( dotted line ) , a consequence of self - shielding .",
    "emission of stellar radiation increases the lw intensity above the background , and the latter quickly becomes unimportant . at @xmath181",

    "the dwarf galaxy highly but not fully ionizes its neighborhood by @xmath116 .",
    "this is likely due to a combination of reasons .",
    "first , as the galaxy evolves into an atomically cooling object , photoheating is no longer able to substantially reduce the gas densities inside it ( see section  [ fig : assemblyhistory ] ) .",
    "ionizing photons emitted by the stellar sources are then efficiently consumed by recombinations in the dense gas , thus limiting the ionizing impact on the surrounding igm .",
    "second , as we will discuss in section  [ sec : feedback ] below , star formation in the dwarf galaxy and its neighboring galaxies exerts a strong negative feedback on neighboring low - mass galaxies , suppressing star formation inside them .",
    "these galaxies thus can not significantly contribute to reionizing the gas .",
    "finally , the considered volume lacks more massive galaxies , which would be robust against the feedback from the dwarf galaxy and could potentially help reionizing the gas .",
    "this is an artifact of the refinement region being too small to contain these rarer halos .",

    "the small difference is probably a numerical artifact of our limited resolution , which is lower than those realized in the previous works .",
    "differences are also expected because the mass of the halo that forms the first star is subject to statistical uncertainties related to the low number of investigated halos ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , and because of differences in the strength of dynamical heating from tidal interactions and mass accretion ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the inclusion of lw radiation increases the minimum collapse mass .",
    "this increase in the minimum collapse mass due to photodissociation by lw radiation has been investigated in detail in a number of previous works ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the inclusion of both lw and ionizing radiation increases the minimum collapse mass in a similar manner but often by a smaller factor , demonstrating a positive feedback from the enhanced formation of molecular hydrogen in ionization fronts and fossil regions . eventually , however , the negative feedback from photoheating outweighs the positive feedback , and there is no new star - forming halo inside the refinement region below @xmath188 .",
    "star formation can still proceed in halos that have previously formed stars , but the masses of these halos are significantly larger than those in simulation _ nofb_. this is the result of the jeans filtering of the igm , which impedes the accretion of gas on low - mass halos .",

    "indeed , the fact that the transition to high central gas densities occurs within a finite range of halo masses shows that dynamical heating plays a non - negligible role , and in the lowest mass halos this may be amplified by the limited mass resolution we afford .",
    "note that some of the halos show an increased baryon fraction @xmath192 as a result of dynamical interaction and ongoing mergers with other halos .",
    "the inclusion of lw radiation implies a complete suppression of star formation only in halos with masses @xmath193 , corresponding to virial temperatures significantly below @xmath194 ( vertical dashed line ) .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with the results from previous high - resolution simulations of the collapse of minihalos in the presence of a lw radiation background .",
    "these works demonstrated that as the minihalo mass approaches the atomic cooling limit , the presence of lw radiation can not prevent the build - up of molecular hydrogen , because it is catalyzed by the elevated electron fraction inside central structure formation shocks ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , and also because of self - shielding ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , the additional inclusion of ionizing radiation can potentially suppress star formation in all halos below the atomic cooling limit by evaporating the gas from the halo centers .",
    "however , as we have already discussed above in figure  [ figure : minimummass ] , inspection of the stellar mass fractions reveals that in simulation _ lw+rt _ , star formation is possible down to lower halo masses than in simulation _",
    "lw _ , a consequence of the positive feedback from ionization ahead of ionization fronts and recombinations of hii regions on the formation of molecular hydrogen ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "the baryon fraction of these halos is reduced primarily because there was not yet enough time for accretion to compensate for the mass loss in past episodes of gaseous outflows .",
    "@xcite investigated radiative feedback from the first galaxies using cosmological simulations of comoving size @xmath199 including processes such as chemical enrichment not treated here . utilizing resolution similar to that realized here",
    ", they demonstrated that the positive feedback due to enhanced molecular hydrogen formation near ionization fronts and inside recombining hii regions can be very strong and compensate for the negative feedback due to photodissociation of molecular hydrogen ( see also , @xcite ) .",
    "our simulations may underestimate this positive feedback because we do not capture the spectral hardening of the ionizing radiation , implying less ionization to stimulate the formation of hydrogen ahead of ionization fronts .",
    "@xcite further demonstrated that the stellar mass fractions of the lowest mass halos are characterized by a large scatter at fixed halo mass .",
    "our simulations do not find as large a scatter , which may be a consequence primarily of the larger star particle mass and statistical limitations caused by the small size of the refinement region in our simulations , although other differences between the simulations may contribute .",
    "we do however find a similar large scatter in the baryon fraction at low halo masses , and we also agree with @xcite that this scatter is driven by radiative feedback from both external and internal sources .",

    "observations of the uv continuum are routinely used to infer the sfr density in the high - redshift universe ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , a key quantity which not only constrains the nature of the stellar populations ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , but also allows one to address the capability of galaxies to reionize the universe ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "observations of the ly@xmath24 line , on the other hand , have enabled , e.g. , spectroscopic confirmation of galaxy candidates well into the epoch of reionization ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "the h@xmath24 line is , however , not affected by resonant scattering ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , rendering it a potentially competitive probe of high - redshift galaxy formation .",
    "the he1640 line , on the other hand , is highly sensitive to the metallicity and imf of the stellar populations , and a high ratio of luminosities in the he1640 to ly@xmath24 or h@xmath24 lines has been suggested a smoking gun for the existence of massive metal - free stars ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a detection of the he1640 line would therefore put strong constraints on current theories of metal enrichment and star formation in the high - redshift universe , but is extremely challenging because of its weak intrinsic strength ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . because we find that both the h@xmath24 and he1640 line fluxes expected from dwarf galaxies such as simulated here are generally too weak to be observed with _ jwst _ , we do not further discuss these emission lines",
    ". however , the reader may refer to our earlier discussion of the observability of the first galaxies in h@xmath24 and he1640 in @xcite .",
    "we use the @xcite population synthesis models for constant star formation to convert the sfrs of the simulated dwarf galaxy in simulation _ lw+rt _ , which included both lw and ionizing radiation , into intrinsic luminosities in the ly@xmath24 recombination line , and in the uv continuum .",

    "this is the same model employed to compute the ionizing and lw luminosities of the stellar bursts in our simulations .",
    "the second model assumes an imf with salpeter slope in the range @xmath201 ( hereafter , normal imf ) and zero metallicity .",
    "the third and final model assumes the same imf as the second model , but a non - zero ( but low ) metallicity @xmath202 .",
    "we convert the line luminosities into observed line fluxes using @xmath203 $ ] , where @xmath204 is the intrinsic ly@xmath24 line luminosity , and @xmath205 the luminosity distance to redshift @xmath206 .",
    "the continuum luminosities are converted into observed flux densities using an analogous equation ( equation  5 in @xcite ) .",
    "the line luminosities and the nebular contribution to the uv continuum luminosities are derived assuming that all ionizing photons are absorbed , i.e. , that the escape fraction is @xmath207 , thus maximizing the flux in the recombination lines .",
    "the line luminosities can be rescaled to the case of non - zero escape fractions by multiplication with @xmath208 .",

    "ly@xmath24 rt simulations show that such effects can be very important , but they often depend sensitively on the specific structure of the investigated galaxies and hence are difficult to generalize ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "finally , our flux estimates scale linearly with the sfrs .",
    "the curves in the bottom part of each panel in figure  [ fig : jwst ] show the resulting uv continuum fluxes ( left ) , and the line flux in ly@xmath24 ( right ) according to the three population synthesis models . for reference",

    "figure  [ fig : jwst ] shows that the galaxy simulated here would be observable out to redshifts @xmath188 in both the uv continuum and the ly@xmath24 line in deep surveys with exposures @xmath209 . while the flux in the uv continuum is insensitive to the properties of the stellar populations ,",
    "the ly@xmath24 flux is significantly larger in the case of metal - free stellar population with top - heavy imf than in the other two cases . at redshifts higher than @xmath210 ,",
    "the reduction in the sfrs , mostly due to radiative feedback , causes the fluxes to decrease sharply below any practical detection limit .",
    "the results presented here are consistent with our earlier results ( @xcite ) , after accounting for the differences in the sfrs .",
    "we caution that the sfrs on which our estimates are based are uncertain for a number of reasons ( see also the discussion in section  [ sec : discussion ] ) .",
    "first , our simulations do not account for feedback from sne or chemical enrichment , both of which must alter the sfrs significantly .",
    "the star formation rates are also uncertain because in the absence of self - regulation by feedback they will depend on the star formation efficiency ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which is currently not well constrained at the high redshifts of interest and for which we have assumed a value appropriate for the local universe ( see section  [ sec : starformation ] ) . as discussed in section  [ sec : disks ] , the finite resolution of our simulations introduces additional uncertainties in the sfrs .",
    "our work is a step towards a more general discussion of the observability of the first galaxies , which ideally should be based on more sophisticated simulations of a larger galaxy sample ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the two nested gas disks in our simulations form only after the halo has reached a virial temperature significantly larger than @xmath211 . in light of the scale - free nature of cold dark matter structure formation , this relatively late formation of the disks may be surprising .",
    "however , it is consistent with results from previous zoomed simulations of the first atomically cooling galaxies which have not exhibited orderly rotation of the gas ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the occurrence of the disks in the dwarf - sized halos fits smoothly in line with simulations of galaxies more massive than the first atomically cooling galaxies assembling at lower redshifts ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the results from these previous works may point at a threshold halo mass for the formation of the first disk galaxies in the range @xmath212 at @xmath213 .",
    "this mass scale is similar to the mass scale above which stellar feedback becomes inefficient .",
    "however , the fact that simulations of the first atomically cooling galaxies have yielded a turbulent morphology even in the absence of star formation suggests that the two scales are physically unrelated .",
    "indeed , in our simulations , the halo mass at the time of disk formation is insensitive to the inclusion of feedback .",
    "nevertheless , the increased robustness of dwarf galaxies against stellar feedback helps to preserve the disks ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we caution that properties other than halo mass such as , e.g. , the environment , or the merger history , may be critical to disk formation in the first galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "our results imply that galaxies with sfrs of @xmath214 will be among the faintest galaxies _ jwst _ is likely to detect at @xmath215 , confirming earlier estimates ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . according to our simulations ,",
    "such galaxies reside in halos with masses of @xmath216 having stellar masses of @xmath217 . in principle , _ jwst _ is sufficiently powerful to detect the light from stellar clusters with masses as low as @xmath218 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "our simulations do not support the formation of such massive clusters , which would require local sfrs @xmath219 , an order of magnitude higher than found here .",
    "however , star formation in our simulations is unresolved , and it is possible that star formation in the first galaxies is more clustered or bursty than implied here . in this case , _ jwst _ could detect galaxies inside halos less massive than considered here , or inside halos that are more strongly affected by feedback than suggested by our simulations . on the other hand , because we do not resolve the formation of stars from first principles , galaxies could be less efficient star - formers than implied by our simulations , and hence be fainter .",
    "such fainter galaxies may still be seen if they are gravitational lensed ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "our simulations have ignored a potentially very important physical process , namely the explosion of massive stars in sne .",
    "sne can provide a strong negative feedback by heating and expelling gas from even relatively massive halos ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "previous works have shown that sn feedback can suppress star formation strongly and lead to bursty star formation histories ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "sn feedback further may create a highly spatially inhomogeneous medium , likely enhancing the fraction of low column density sight - lines and hence the fraction of escaping ionizing photons ( e.g. , @xcite ; but see @xcite ) .",
    "sn feedback may disturb the assembly of disks inside the first galaxies strongly ( e.g. , @xcite ; but see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , sn feedback may modify the structure of the dark matter halos significantly ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "our simulations also ignored the chemical enrichment of the gas by the metals synthesized in stars .",
    "simulations that track the production and transport of metals suggest that the transition between metal - free and metal - enriched stellar populations may occur early in the history of the universe ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "significant uncertainties , however , remain as to the efficiency of the mixing of metals with the primordial gas and the level of spatial homogeneity of metal enrichment ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this , together with the fact that not all stars are expected to explode in sne and enrich the gas but may instead collapse directly into black holes ( e.g. , @xcite ) , leaves open the possibility of the formation of metal - free stars in select regions of the universe down to relatively low redshifts ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , even if all stars would collapse into black holes without sne , feedback from accretion onto the black holes may still affect the evolution of the galaxies in a manner not captured by our simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we have presented cosmological smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of a dwarf galaxy assembling in a halo reaching @xmath220 at @xmath1 .",
    "the simulations were identical to our earlier simulations of such a galaxy in that they followed the non - equilibrium chemistry and cooling of primordial gas .",
    "they improved on our earlier simulations by including the formation of massive metal - free stars . to investigate the radiative feedback from these stars , we compared a simulation in which star particles emitted both molecular hydrogen dissociating and hydrogen / helium ionizing radiation and a simulation in which star particles emitted only dissociating radiation with a simulation inside which star particles remained dark .",
    "our main results are :    * dissociating and ionizing radiation exert a strong negative feedback by suppressing star formation in the main minihalo progenitor of the dwarf galaxy , but have little effect on star formation as soon as the progenitor evolves into an atomically cooling galaxy .",
    "* radiative feedback suppresses the central dark matter densities in the dwarf galaxy main progenitor minihalo relative to the densities found in the simulation without radiation .",
    "the dark matter density profile of the dwarf galaxy is singular isothermal independent of the inclusion of radiation shortly after the minihalo has evolved into an atomic cooling halo . *",

    "the inclusion of dissociating and ionizing radiation lowers the baryon fractions inside the minihalos in the neighborhood of the dwarf galaxy .",
    "the baryon fractions are lowest in minihalos with masses @xmath195 , a consequence of jeans filtering and photoevaporation from external ionizing sources , and in minihalos with masses @xmath224 , here primarily a consequence of photoevaporation of gas by internal ionizing sources . *",
    "galaxies with star formation rates @xmath214 will be among the faintest galaxies the upcoming _ james webb space telescope _ will detect in deep exposures of the @xmath223 universe .",

    "we emphasize that the approximations and choices of numerical parameters employed in this work and described below are specific to the current work .",
    "the rt makes use of the rt code traphic  ( @xcite ; @xcite ) implemented in a customized copy of version 3 of gadget ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in simulations with traphic ,",
    "the rt equation is solved by tracing a finite number of discrete photon packets emitted by ionizing source particles through the simulation box .",
    "this is done directly on the irregular grid defined by the sph particles , at the speed of light , and in a photon - conserving manner ( @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to the description of traphic  given below , the reader may refer to the original publications for further details .",
    "each photon packet carries photons of characteristic frequency @xmath227 .",
    "we denote the total number of frequency bins used to discretize the radiation spectrum by @xmath228 .",
    "the transport of photons during a single time step proceeds by a succession of emission and transmission steps that move photon packets from individual particles , either sph or star particles , to a number of @xmath229 sph neighbors .",
    "the neighbors of a given particle are particles located inside the neighbor sphere , which is a sphere centered on the particle and contains @xmath229 neighboring particles .",
    "therefore , @xmath229 determines the spatial resolution at which the rt is carried out .",
    "we choose @xmath230 , which reflects a compromise between keeping high spatial resolution and controlling particle discreteness noise ( @xcite ) .",
    "star particles emit photon packets to their @xmath229 neighboring sph particles inside @xmath231 emission cones , each subtending a solid angle of @xmath232 .",
    "emission cones tessellate the sky and are used to accomplish the isotropic emission of photon packets to the sph neighbors despite the possibly highly anisotropic distribution of the sph particles ( see the appendix in @xcite ) .",
    "photon packets emitted inside emission cones containing multiple sph neighbors are split in proportion to the inverse squared distance between the source and the neighbors to account for the dilution of the radiation field with distance from the source .",
    "the central axes of the emission cones define the initial propagation directions of the emitted photon packets .",
    "the parameter @xmath231 determines the angular sampling of the sky as seen from any given ionizing source .",
    "we choose @xmath233 .",
    "even though the orientation of the emission cone tessellation is randomly rotated at each rt time step , our choice of a small number of emission cones may imply increased random scatter in the distribution of the photoionized and photoheated gas , especially around halos that contain only a few star particles ( see appendix  [ sec : parameters ] for an illustration ) .",
    "sph particles that receive photon packets transmit these packets along the associated propagation directions to their downstream neighbors .",
    "individual photon packets are transmitted only to the sph neighbors located inside transmission cones , which are regular cones with solid angles subtending @xmath234 steradians centered around the propagation directions and with their apex attached to the transmitting particle , where @xmath235 is a parameter specified below .",
    "the use of transmission cones prevents uncontrolled diffusion of photon packets on the set of irregularly distributed sph particles and keeps the photon transport directed .",
    "photon packets that are emitted inside transmission cones containing multiple sph neighbors are split equally between these neighbors .",
    "the parameter @xmath235 sets the angular resolution at which the rt is performed . because the transmission cones are defined locally at the positions of the transmitting sph particles and because photon packets are only distributed among the subset of the @xmath229 neighbors that fall inside these transmission cones , the angular resolution is independent of the distance from the sources . in this work",
    "we adopt @xmath236 . in test simulations of the rt around multiple sources inside a static cosmological density field presented in @xcite we found that the results had converged at a lower angular resolution of @xmath237 .",
    "note that virtual particles are created to accomplish the emission and transport of photon packets in cones that do not contain sph neighbors , as described in @xcite .",
    "photon packets received by sph particles are merged , which allows one to control the number of photon packets inside the simulation box and to avoid the scaling of the computational cost with the number of sources .",
    "the merging is done by binning photon packets in solid angle using a set of @xmath238 tessellating reception cones with solid angles @xmath239 attached to each sph particle .",
    "the merging is done separately for each frequency bin and hence it limits the number of photon packets to be transmitted next to at most @xmath240 .",
    "accordingly , the computational cost of the rt scales with @xmath238 , but not with the number of ionizing sources . in this work",
    "we set @xmath241 , motivated by test simulations similar to those presented in @xcite .",
    "photon packets are associated a clock that is used to control the speed at which they travel ( see @xcite ) . in this work",
    "we set this speed equal to the physical speed of light .",
    "however , for computational efficiency we allow photon packets to travel only a single inter - particle distance during individual rt time steps . in the limit of small rt time steps ,",
    "transporting photon packets at the speed of light but limited by a single inter - particle distance is equivalent to solving the time - dependent rt equation ( see @xcite for a similar argument in the case of the time - independent rt ) .",
    "the hybrid approach employed here prevents the photons from traveling faster than the speed of light but , depending on the size of the rt time step and the inter - particle distance , may imply that photons travel at an effective speed that is lower than the speed of light , possibly resulting in an artificially delayed propagation of ionization fronts .",

    "we assume that the mean intensity @xmath257 is characterized by a black body spectrum of temperature @xmath259 , appropriate for the emission of radiation by the first stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which gives @xmath260 , @xmath261 , and @xmath262 .",
    "we have employed the fits to the photoionization cross - sections from @xcite .    at fixed mean intensity @xmath257 , the grey approximation implies photoionization rates identical to those inferred from a full multi - frequency treatment .",
    "however , because of the use of only a single frequency bin , our simulations ignore the hardening of the radiation spectrum with distance from the source caused by the preferential absorption of lower energy photons with larger absorption cross sections ( see , e.g. , the discussion in @xcite ) .      at the end of each rt time step the photoionization and photoheating rates are computed .",

    "chemistry , heating , and cooling of the gas are computed at the end of each rt time step .",
    "this is done by subcycling the rt time step using time steps computed by the implicit non - equilibrium solver described in section  [ sec : cooling ] .",
    "note that because photoionization rates are obtained from the number of absorptions computed under the assumption that species fractions and temperatures remain constant during the time @xmath274 , not all photons that have been absorbed always end up consumed in the computation of the chemistry and thermodynamics of the gas .",
    "this is a consequence of the evolution of the chemical composition and temperature during the subcycling . to ensure photon conservation we reinsert the remaining photons into the rt at the beginning of the next rt time step , and set them to be propagated along their original directions .",
    "the change in chemical abundances and temperature affects the dynamics of the particles only at the end of their gravito - hydrodynamical time steps , at which time the particle entropies are updated and the sizes of the new gravito - hydrodynamical time steps are determined . in gadget , particles evolve along a hierarchy of individual particle gravito - hydrodynamical time steps that may be much longer than the smallest such time step , the latter also being the time step at which the radiative cooling and heating is computed .",
    "this means that the radiation - hydrodynamical response of the gas to photoionization heating may occur with a delay .",
    "recently , @xcite have shown , in the context of thermal feedback from supernova explosions , that the lack of a prompt response to localized energy injection may lead to a strong violation of the conservation of energy when using the standard gadget time integration scheme employed also here .",

    "first , we have substituted the explicit solver for the evolution of the chemistry and temperature of primordial atomic gas in the presence of photoionizations used and tested in @xcite with the implicit solver used in @xcite and described in section  [ sec : cooling ] .",
    "this solver accounts for additional species , such as molecular hydrogen , and employs different rates for the atomic and molecular physics . it has been described and extensively tested in a number of publications ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , it has not yet been tested in combination with traphic . in appendix",
    "[ sec : tests : rt ] we therefore repeat the rt test simulation on a static cosmological density field from @xcite .",
    "the results of this test are in excellent agreement with our previous results , demonstrating the validity of our implementation .",
    "second , the current work is the first to employ traphic  in radiation - hydrodynamic simulations that account for the feedback of photoionization heating on the gas dynamics .",
    "we have performed the radiation - hydrodynamical tests from @xcite , and we have achieved excellent agreement with the published reference results in all of them . in appendix",
    "[ sec : tests : rhd ] we provide a discussion of one of the tests relevant to the present work , the simulation of the evaporation of a minihalo by an internal ionizing source .",
    "finally , in appendix  [ sec : parameters ] , we investigate how our adoption of a limited photon propagation speed and a finite angular sampling affects the early evolution of the minihalo in simulation _",
    "lw+rt _ analyzed in the main text .      in this section",
    "we repeat test  4 of the cosmological rt code comparison project ( @xcite ) that we have previously discussed in @xcite , using a chemistry solver different from the one employed here .",
    "the test involves the simulation of regions around multiple ionizing sources in a static cosmological density field .",
    "it was designed to capture important aspects of state - of - the - art simulations of hydrogen reionization , such as the delayed propagation in or trapping of ionization fronts by dense gas .",
    "the setup of this test is identical to that of test 4 in @xcite , to which we refer the reader for a detailed description .",
    "briefly , the initial conditions are provided by a snapshot ( at redshift @xmath275 ) from a cosmological @xmath25-body and gas - dynamical uniform - mesh simulation .",
    "the simulation box is @xmath276 on a side , where @xmath277 , and is uniformly divided into @xmath278 cells .",
    "we monte carlo sample this density field to replace the mesh cells with @xmath279 sph particles .",
    "the gas consists purely of atomic hydrogen and is assumed to be initially neutral at temperature @xmath280 .",
    "the ionizing sources are chosen to correspond to the 16 most massive halos in the box , and are assumed to have blackbody spectra with temperature @xmath259 .",
    "for comparison with @xcite we solve the time - independent rt equation with an angular resolution of @xmath281 , set the number of neighbors to which sources emit radiation to @xmath282 , employ a time step @xmath283 , and transport photons only over a single inter - particle distance per time step .",
    "we transport radiation using a single frequency bin , employing the grey photoionization cross - section @xmath284 .",
    "we assume that each photoionization adds @xmath285 to the thermal energy of the gas , as appropriate for the adopted blackbody spectrum .    in figure",
    "[ fig : test4:slices ] we show results of this simulation and compare them with those presented in @xcite and also with the reference results reported in @xcite .",
    "the agreement is very good if one accounts for the differences in the atomic physics and the approximations employed ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "[ sec : tests : rhd ] in this section we perform test  6 of the cosmological rt code comparison project ( @xcite ) .",
    "this test consists of the simulation of the expansion of a region driven by an ionizing point source at the center of a spherically symmetric region with a steeply declining gas density profile .",
    "in contrast to the test described in the previous section , the gas distribution is not forced to remain static but may evolve in response to photoionization heating from the central source .",
    "the test situation shares some of the main features of the evolution of gas densities inside high - redshift cosmological minihalos under photoionization from a central massive metal - free star .",
    "the physical setup of the test is as follows .",
    "the initial gas densities are described by a cored isothermal density profile , @xmath286 we follow @xcite and set @xmath287 and @xmath288 , and we assume that the gas , consisting solely of atomic hydrogen , is initially neutral at temperature @xmath289 .",
    "the central source has a constant ionizing luminosity of @xmath290 throughout the simulation , and is characterized by a blackbody spectrum with temperature @xmath291 .",
    "following @xcite , all relevant cooling processes are included , except for compton cooling . in this test , gravitational forces are ignored .",
    "we implement the power - law density profile by applying a local radial stretch along the direction towards the central source to the inter - particle distances of sph particles that are initially distributed uniformly with density @xmath292 . denoting the initial particle positions with @xmath293 ,",
    "such a stretching is expressed by the transformation @xmath294 , where @xmath295 and @xmath296 are the usual two angles needed to specify a position in spherical coordinates .",
    "mass conservation then requires the new coordinates @xmath297 to satisfy @xmath298 substituting a power - law density profile , @xmath299 , the last equation can be integrated to yield @xmath300 . in the present case , @xmath301 , and hence @xmath302 .",
    "therefore , a singular isothermal profile can be obtained by stretching the initial inter - particle distances between uniformly distributed particles along the radial directions towards the center by a factor @xmath303 .",
    "the initial uniform density field is generated by placing particles randomly in the simulation box .",
    "to reduce the associated shot noise , the resulting particle distribution is regularized by evolving the particles under the influence of a reversed - sign ( i.e. , repulsive ) gravitational force until the particles settle down into a glass - like quasi - equilibrium ( @xcite ) . after generating the singular isothermal density profile ,",
    "we replace the central region within @xmath304 with a uniform glass - like particle distribution to introduce the central core .",
    "the numerical parameters used in this test are as follows .",
    "we place the ionizing source in the center of a box with linear size @xmath305 .",
    "we sample the gas inside the core with radius @xmath304 using 30000 particles , which corresponds to an equivalent uniform grid resolution of @xmath306 cells .",
    "this resolution is slightly higher than the uniform grid resolution employed in @xcite , which was @xmath307 cells .",
    "we use an angular resolution @xmath308 , a number of neighbors for the emitting source @xmath282 , employ a rt time step @xmath309 , and transport photons only over a single inter - particle distance per time step .",
    "we limit the sizes of the individual particle hydrodynamical time steps to be less than @xmath310 .",
    "the radiation is transported using a single frequency bin and assuming a grey photoionization cross - section @xmath311 , as well as that each photoionization adds @xmath312 to the thermal energy of the gas .",
    "the parameter values are chosen to make contact with the conditions in the simulations presented in the main part of this paper , and to ensure numerical convergence .",
    "the test results are not critically sensitive to the adopted parameter values .",
    "however , we note that because of our choice of emitting photon packets only once per rt time step , the angular sampling depends on the rt time step , and a larger rt time step would imply an increased scatter in the ionized fraction , temperature and density profiles ( see appendix  [ sec : parameters ] ) .        in this section",
    "we discuss the effects of our approximations regarding the limited photon propagation speed and the emission of photon packets by ionizing sources along a finite set of random directions per rt time step .",
    "to this end we have repeated the rt around the first stellar burst in the minihalo progenitor of simulation _",
    "lw+rt_. the first test simulation that we have performed , hereafter _",
    "test - base _ , employed rt parameters identical to those employed in _",
    "lw+rt_. in particular , in this simulation ionizing sources emitted photon packets along @xmath313 random directions per rt time step , and the photon propagation was done at the speed of light but limited to a single inter - particle distance per rt time step . to investigate the effect of the limitation in the propagation speed ,",
    "simulation _ test - base _ is compared with a simulation in which photon packets propagate at the speed of light with no additional limitation regarding the number of inter - particle distances per rt time step ( hereafter _ test - speed _ ; and with ionizing sources emitting photons into @xmath313 random directions per rt time step as in _ test - base _ ) .",
    "to investigate the effect of the angular sampling , simulation _ test - speed _ is compared with a simulation in which sources emit photon packets along @xmath314 times more random directions per rt time step ( hereafter _ test - sampling _ ; and transporting photons at the speed of light as in _ test - speed _ ) .",
    "the latter is implemented by repeating the emission of radiation along the @xmath313 random directions @xmath314 times per rt time step , with each emission using a different set of @xmath313 random directions and emitting photon packets that contain by a factor @xmath314 fewer photons .",
    "figure  [ fig : parameters ] shows the gas temperature in a thin slice through the center of the minihalo progenitor at @xmath315 , at the end of the stellar burst , in the three test simulations _ test - base _",
    "( left ) , _ test - speed _ ( middle ) , and _ test - sampling _ ( right ) .",
    "the final extent of the photoheated region is similar in simulations _ test - base _ and _ test - speed _ despite the difference in propagation speeds .",
    "this is because the rt with traphic  conserves the number of ionizing photons that are transmitted and absorbed , and because the final extent of photoheated regions is set primarily by this number .",
    "however , limitations of the speed at which photons are propagated can lead to differences in extent and shape of the developing regions early during their evolution ( e.g. , @xcite ) . the increased angular sampling in simulation _ test - sampling _ reduces the noise that characterizes the shape of the photoheated region in simulation _ test - base _ , as expected .",
    "however , this noise is already small in simulation _ test - base _ , which hence yields a photoheated region similar in shape to that in simulation _ test - sampling_. we note ( but do not show ) that the evolution of the properties of the minihalo , such as , e.g. , the maximum gas density , is nearly identical in all three test simulations ."
