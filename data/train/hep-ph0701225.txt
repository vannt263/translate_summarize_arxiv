    "a nucleon at low energy can be seen as made of three valence quarks , constantly interacting via gluon exchanges and virtual fluctuations at all space - time scales smaller than the size of the nucleon itself . in an interaction process with a probe ,",
    "only those fluctuations which are longer lived / larger than the resolution of the probe are actually relevant .",
    "in addition , interaction processes at low energy are made very complicated by the fact that the constituents of the nucleon can interact during the time seen by the probe .",
    "when one boosts the nucleon to a higher energy , all its internal time scales are dilated , which simplifies the interaction process with the probe : the interactions among the constituents of the nucleon now occur over much larger time - scales , and therefore the probe sees only a collection of _ free _ constituents . moreover , the life - time of the quantum fluctuations is also time dilated , and thus the number of gluons taking part to the interaction process increases with the collision energy .",
    "simultaneously , the fluctuations that were already important at the lower energy are now evolving so slowly that they can be considered static over the time - scale seen by the external probe .",
    "however , this growth with energy of the number of gluons in the wave - function of a nucleon ( or nucleus ) can not continue indefinitely .",
    "indeed , it would imply that nucleon - nucleon cross - sections grow faster than what is allowed by froissart s unitarity bound .",
    "in fact , an important aspect of the physics is missing in the above picture : gluons can recombine when their occupation number is large , a process known as _",
    "gluon saturation _ @xcite . to quantify when this new phenomenon occurs",
    ", one must compare the number of gluons per unit of transverse area , @xmath2 , and the cross - section for recombination , @xmath3 .",
    "saturation occurs when @xmath4 , or equivalently @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is known as the _ saturation momentum_. the equation @xmath7 delineates the border of the saturation domain , indicated in figure [ fig : satdomain ] .",
    "phenomenologically , @xmath8 varies like dependence follows from the fact that all the gluons at a given impact parameter act coherently , and the @xmath9 dependence can be inferred from the gluon distribution measured at hera ] @xmath10 with the nucleus atomic number @xmath11 and the momentum fraction @xmath9 .",
    "the color glass condensate ( cgc ) is a description of the nature of the saturated nuclear matter , in which a saturation scale emerges naturally . in the cgc description ,",
    "the fast partons ( large @xmath9 ) are described as static color sources  represented by a density @xmath12 in the transverse plane  that act as external sources .",
    "conversely , the slow partons ( low @xmath9 ) , dominated by gluons , are described by the usual dynamical gauge fields @xmath13 .",
    "such a separation of the degrees of freedom was first proposed in the mclerran - venugopalan model @xcite . in order to make this description complete",
    ", one needs to specify the distribution @xmath14 $ ] for the hard sources in a projectile that has evolved up to the rapidity @xmath15 .",
    "this distribution is in principle non - perturbative , but its evolution with rapidity @xmath16 is controlled by an evolution equation that can be derived in perturbation theory @xcite , @xmath17}{\\partial y } = { \\cal h}[\\rho]\\;w_{_y}[\\rho]\\ ; , \\ ] ] known as the jimwlk equation .",
    "this functional evolution equation can be seen as an extension of the bfkl equation @xcite that incorporates the effect of gluon recombination .",
    "it has a very useful mean field approximation : the balitsky - kovchegov equation @xcite .",
    "these evolution equations are presently known at leading logarithmic accuracy , but several recent works have extended them in order to include the next - to - leading order corrections that come from the running of the strong coupling constant @xcite .",
    "another direction actively pursued is aimed at including `` pomeron loops '' in this description ( see @xcite for recent advances ) .",
    "pomeron loops can be seen as fluctuations that are important in the region when the gluon occupation number is low , and may affect crucially the rapidity evolution of scattering amplitudes since it is controlled by the tail of the gluon distribution .",
    "the first evidence of saturation comes from the `` geometrical scaling '' observed in deep inelastic scattering at hera @xcite .",
    "there , the measured @xmath18 cross - section at @xmath19  which in principle depends on both variables @xmath9 and @xmath20  was found to depend only on the combination @xmath21 with @xmath22 ( see the left panel of figure [ fig : gs - lf ] ) .",
    "such a scaling is a direct consequence of the behavior of solutions of the evolution equation for the distribution of sources in the target proton , and the value of the exponent @xmath23 can be accounted for from a careful analysis of these solutions @xcite .",
    "going beyond this simple scaling , saturation physics leads to very good fits to a broad set of data from hera and rhic @xcite .",
    "another experimental result which is suggestive of saturation is the so - called `` limiting fragmentation '' ( right panel of figure [ fig : gs - lf ] ) . by shifting the rapidity axis by the beam rapidity",
    ", one can see that the rapidity distribution for produced particles at collisions of various energies tend to some universal curve in the fragmentation region @xcite . in the cgc framework , this property follows naturally from the unitarization of scattering amplitudes in the dense target , and the approximate bjorken scaling in the fragmenting nucleus .",
    "the limiting curve then appears to be a reflection of the parton distribution at large @xmath9 in the fragmenting nucleus @xcite .",
    "the observation of the suppression of hadron spectra at rather large @xmath24 and forward rapidity in deuteron - gold collisions at rhic @xcite ( see figure [ fig : forward ] for brahms results ) provides further information on the onset of saturation .",
    "the fact that the nuclear modification factor @xmath25 is larger than unity at mid rapidity is believed to be an effect of multiple scatterings ( cronin effect ) , and the suppression of this ratio at forward rapidities is a consequence of the shadowing that builds up via the evolution in @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "in order to use the cgc framework to describe the collision of two nucleons or nuclei , one needs two color sources @xmath26 , representing respectively the two projectiles , that couple to the gauge fields ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion on this ) via the following current , @xmath27 as illustrated in figure [ fig : coll ] , the description of heavy ion collisions is usually split into several stages , each of them being described by different theoretical tools . it is expected that perturbation theory is appropriate for the very early stages , during which the constituents of the incoming nuclei are released and particles are initially produced .",
    "however , in a typical central heavy ion collision at high energy , 99% of the produced particles have a transverse momentum below 2  gev ",
    "i.e. below the saturation momentum . in this region ,",
    "collinear factorization breaks down , and it is believed that the cgc framework is more appropriate for describing the initial particle production .    in the saturation regime , the sources @xmath26 are typically of order of @xmath28 , which alters the power counting for gluon production : adding an extra source to a given diagram does not change its order , implying that the color sources @xmath26 should be included to all orders .",
    "a typical diagram contributing to gluon production from these sources is illustrated in the right panel of figure [ fig : coll ] .",
    "in general , there are several disconnected subdiagrams , including some that do not produce any gluon ( vacuum diagrams ) @xcite .      at leading order @xcite",
    ", one must sum all the tree diagrams , with an arbitrary number of color sources  in general a very complicated task .",
    "however , for the inclusive gluon spectrum , this can be done from the classical solution of yang - mills equations with _ retarded boundary conditions_. the retarded nature of the boundary conditions leads to an important simplification : one can reformulate the problem as an initial value problem where one specifies the fields and their first time derivatives just above the light - cone ( and these initial conditions can be obtained analytically ) .",
    "this classical solution of the equation of motion is a sum of tree diagrams with retarded propagators , as illustrated in figure [ fig : gluonlo ] .",
    "an important feature of the classical solution of yang - mills equations is its invariance under boosts in the longitudinal solution , which implies that the field has only zero modes with respect to the rapidity variable @xmath29 .      in order to make the foundations of this description more robust ,",
    "it is important to study loop corrections .",
    "one reason for doing so is to check the factorization of the leading logarithms of @xmath30 in the evolution of the distribution of sources @xmath31 $ ] , which is necessary for the internal consistency of this framework .",
    "another motivation comes from the recent observation that the lo boost invariant solution is unstable against rapidity dependent perturbations @xcite  and loop corrections are a natural origin for such perturbations .",
    "although the lo calculation of the gluon spectrum is non - perturbative since it requires to solve the yang - mills equation to all orders in the sources @xmath26 , it turns out that one can express the 1-loop contributions as a perturbation of the initial value problem encountered at lo .",
    "there are two contributions , illustrated in figure [ fig : gluonnlo ] .",
    "the nlo correction can be obtained by the action of some analytically calculable operator on the lo contribution , seen as a functional of the fields and canonical momenta on the light - cone @xcite , @xmath32\\ ;   n_{_{lo}}[{\\cal a}_{\\rm in}[\\rho_1,\\rho_2]]\\ ; .\\ ; \\label{eq : nlo}\\ ] ] in this formula , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are respectively the 1-point and 2-point functions represented in green in figure [ fig : gluonnlo ]  they are in principle _",
    "calculable analytically_. @xmath35 is the generator of shifts of the initial condition at point @xmath36 on the light - cone for the solution of yang - mills equations ) is only a sketch of the actual formula .",
    "indeed , @xmath37 depends on both the initial fields @xmath38 and momenta @xmath39 on the light - cone , and there should therefore be shift operators for both of them . ] , i.e. a functional derivative @xmath40 .",
    "( [ eq : nlo ] ) is sufficient to discuss the structure of singularities that arise at 1-loop  :    * the coefficients @xmath41 and @xmath42 are infinite , due to divergences in integrations over rapidity @xcite . *",
    "the quantity @xmath43 diverges when the time @xmath44 goes to infinity .",
    "this is due to the instability of the boost invariant classical solution found in @xcite .",
    "the first type of divergences is related to the evolution with rapidity of the distributions @xmath31 $ ] . for the cgc framework to be consistent",
    ", one should be able to absorb these divergences in the rapidity dependence of @xmath31 $ ]  a statement very similar in spirit to the factorization of collinear divergences in conventional perturbative qcd . another way to state",
    "the same problem is to set fictitious boundaries in rapidity , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , between the observable ( here the number operator ) and the color sources .",
    "now , all integrations over rapidity in the observable are over the finite range @xmath47 $ ] , and thus lead to a finite result .",
    "thus , @xmath41 and @xmath48 become finite , but @xmath45 and @xmath46 dependent .",
    "naturally , the distributions of color sources , @xmath31 $ ] , must now be evolved from the beam rapidities to @xmath45 and @xmath46 respectively .",
    "the factorization alluded to before is equivalent to the requirement that the @xmath45 and @xmath46 dependence cancel between the 1-loop correction to the observable and the rapidity evolution of the distributions of sources . for this cancellation to happen",
    ", one will need to establish the following relation for these divergent terms @xcite  : @xmath49_{{\\rm divergent}\\atop{\\rm coefficients } } = \\big [ ( y_0-y){\\cal h}^\\dagger[\\rho_1]+(y - y_0^\\prime){\\cal h}^\\dagger[\\rho_2 ] \\big]\\ ; n_{_{lo}}[{\\cal a}_{\\rm in}]\\ ; , \\;\\ ] ] where @xmath50 $ ] is the same hamiltonian as in the jimwlk evolution equation .",
    "the second type of problem is due to an instability of the _ boost invariant _ solution of the classical yang - mills equations @xcite .",
    "after resummation of these divergences to all orders , the operator acting on @xmath37 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nlo ] ) will be replaced by some functional @xmath51 $ ] .",
    "formally , one can perform a `` fourier transform '' of this functional by introducing some auxiliary field @xmath52 on the light - cone is a shortcut for both the field and canonical momentum on the light - cone . ] , and then rewrite the contribution of the resummed unstable modes as can not trigger the instability because @xmath33 is boost invariant .",
    "thus , @xmath51=z[-{\\bs t}_\\x]$ ] and its fourier transform @xmath53 $ ]  the wigner distribution of the initial fluctuations ",
    "is real . ] @xmath54_{{\\rm unstable}\\atop{\\rm modes } } & = & \\int \\big[d a(\\x)\\big]\\;\\widetilde{z}[a]\\ ; \\exp\\big\\{i\\int_\\x a(\\x){\\bs t}_\\x\\big\\}\\ ; n_{_{lo}}[{\\cal a}_{\\rm in } ] \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\int \\big[d a(\\x)\\big]\\;\\widetilde{z}[a]\\ ; n_{_{lo}}[{\\cal a}_{\\rm in}+a]\\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in other words , resumming the unstable modes can be done by solving the classical yang - mills equations with a fluctuation @xmath52 superimposed to the boost invariant initial condition @xmath55 , with a distribution @xmath53 $ ] .",
    "this is the formal justification for the fluctuations added to the initial conditions in @xcite . by a completely different approach @xcite",
    ", it appears that the functional @xmath53 $ ] is a gaussian , suggesting that the resummation of the unstable modes is simply an exponentiation .",
    "qcd at small @xmath9 , and in particular gluon saturation , has become an important aspect of hadronic collisions at rhic and lhc energies . in nucleus - nucleus collisions ,",
    "the cgc is the appropriate framework to study the early stages of the collision , because most of the particles are produced from low @xmath9 gluons .",
    "it seems now technically feasible to compute the 1-loop corrections to the gluon spectrum , and to resum their diverging terms .",
    "doing so would allow one to prove for the cgc framework factorization results that are crucial for the overall consistency of this approach .",
