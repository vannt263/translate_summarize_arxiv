    "since the discovery of the large scale isotropy of the cosmic microwave background , there has been a major endeavour to explain this characteristic of our universe , with the aim of eventually understanding its origin and future evolution .    from several competing schools of thought , it was misner s _ chaotic cosmology _ concept @xcite which was the first prominent idea to explain the isotropy of our universe . according to this picture the beginning of",
    "the universe was extremely irregular and chaotic .",
    "the advantage of this view is the avoidance of having to implement too stringent constraints on the initial state of the universe , in order to obtain its currently observed state through cosmic evolution . in a sense",
    "the current state of our universe would be fairly independent of the exact conditions at its beginning .",
    "the apparent isotropy of the universe was conjectured to have been produced through subsequent dissipative effects , such as the production and collisions of particles , neutrino viscosity , etc . , and is therefore observed because we must live at a sufficiently _ late stage _ of the evolution of our universe .",
    "some detailed analyses , however , have indicated that _ chaotic cosmology _ is untenable in its full generality , e.g. , the expected entropy production through dissipation seems to be incompatible with the observed photon per baryon number @xcite .",
    "_ quiescent cosmology _",
    ", on the other hand , was introduced by barrow @xcite as an alternative concept to cope with the difficulties arising in the above scenario , and stands in direct contrast to _",
    "chaotic cosmology_. according to this view , the universe must , in fact , have originated in a highly regular and smooth beginning .",
    "gravitational attraction , which becomes dominant on large scales , is responsible for the evolution away from the initial isotropy and homogeneity of the universe .",
    "this scenario implies that we observe isotropy as a consequence of living at a somewhat _ early stage _ of the evolution of our universe .",
    "it also suggests that a classical cosmological model describing our own universe should possess an initial singularity which is similar to the one in the isotropic frw models .",
    "a possible justification for the initial isotropy of the universe is offered by penrose s notion of _ gravitational entropy _",
    "@xcite , i.e. , the contribution of the gravitational field to the total entropy , which behaves somewhat anomalously in that it increases with the clumping of matter and becomes maximal in a black hole ; this might seem counter - intuitive at first sight when one considers the usual behaviour of entropy with regard to the matter distribution .",
    "this behaviour is due to the fact that the gravitational force is ( at the classical level ) universally attractive . as a consequence of the arrow of time the initial state of the universe",
    "must have been one of low entropy , and since matter as well as radiation were presumably initially in thermal equilibrium , it seems reasonable to search for the necessary low entropy constraint in the geometry of space - time itself rather than in a special matter distribution .",
    "a low gravitational entropy constraint is provided by a faint degree of clumping and therefore spatial isotropy .",
    "this low degree of clumping can be associated with a bounded weyl curvature @xcite and therefore provides a connection between weyl curvature and _ gravitational entropy _ which is known as the _ weyl curvature hypothesis _ ( wch ) . there",
    "exist several versions of the wch , with most authors using the hypothesis that the weyl curvature vanished initially . here",
    "we will adopt a weaker version , however , namely the expectation that the weyl curvature would initially be matter ( i.e. , ricci ) dominated and that the converse would be true at a cosmological future .    for a detailed theoretical investigation of _ quiescent cosmology _ , the wch and their structural implications for cosmological models , we need to utilise a suitable mathematical framework .",
    "goode and wainwright @xcite provided the geometric definition of an _",
    "isotropic singularity_henceforth called an _ isotropic past singularity _",
    "( ips)which generalises a considerable amount of previous work on initial singularities and which gives a beautiful formalisation of _ quiescent cosmology _ , at least for the initial state of our universe . for the motivation of the results concerning cosmological futures presented in this article , and for comparison , it is necessary to summarise the features of an ips at this point :    [ isdef1.def ]    a space - time @xmath0",

    "represents the fluid flow of definition [ fluidflow1.def ] ) .",
    ", scaledwidth=75.0%,scaledwidth=55.0% ]    it is important to note that , due to the form of the definition , one should think here of the _ physical space - time _ as being produced from the _ unphysical _ one , rather than vice - versa . in this sense , the initial singularity in the _ physical space - time _ is due only to the vanishing of @xmath18 on the regular spacelike hypersurface @xmath10 in @xmath3 .",
    "consequently , the slice @xmath10 will be referred to as the ips .    moving the entire singular behaviour into the vanishing of the conformal factor",
    "provides a great analytical advantage , since the regularity in the _ unphysical space - time _ at @xmath10 guarantees simple derivations of implications of the definition through the conformal relationships for physical quantities @xcite .",
    "as will be seen , however , this analytical advantage will not fully be realised anymore at an appropriate cosmological future .    in order to explore how",
    "isotropic the above definition really is , one can investigate several types of isotropy , all of which can be found in the frw universes @xcite .",
    "significant for the subsequent investigations in this article are the following two types :    ( 1 ) : :    _ weyl isotropy : _",
    "@xmath19 , i.e. , there do not    exist preferred directions due to the principal null directions .",
    "( 2 ) : :    _ kinematic isotropy relative to the cosmological fluid flow    @xmath20 : _    @xmath21 ,",
    "i.e. ,    the shear and vorticity eigenvectors , as well as the acceleration    vector can not define preferred directions orthogonal to    @xmath20 .",
    "in fact , it can be shown that definition [ isdef1.def ] alone does not , in general , guarantee such an initial isotropy of a cosmological model @xcite , not even asymptotically in the sense that initially the weyl curvature would be ricci dominated and that the isotropic kinematic quantity , namely the expansion @xmath22 , would dominate over the anisotropic kinematic quantities , such as the vorticity , shear and acceleration .",
    "this is trivially the case for the isotropic frw models which are characterised by a globally vanishing weyl tensor , vorticity , shear and acceleration and a non - vanishing expansion .",
    "a further constraint on the fluid flow , however , fixes the problem of the initial asymptotic isotropy , namely @xcite :    [ fluidflow1.def ]    with any unit timelike congruence @xmath20 in @xmath5 we can associate a unit timelike congruence @xmath23 in @xmath3 such that @xmath24    ( a ) : :    if we can choose @xmath23 to be regular ( at    least @xmath9 ) on an open neighbourhood of    @xmath10 in @xmath3 , we say that    @xmath20 is _ regular at the isotropic past    singularity . _",
    "( b ) : :    if , in addition , @xmath23 is orthogonal to    @xmath10 , we say that @xmath20 is _",
    "orthogonal    to the isotropic past singularity .",
    "_    including this definition  which might seem a bit _ ad hoc _ at first sight , but which is actually fulfilled in a wide class of models  is crucial for the framework of an ips .",
    "goode and wainwright @xcite proved that for a unit timelike congruence @xmath20 which is regular at , and orthogonal to the ips ( and which always exists ) , an asymptotic isotropy holds , in the sense that @xmath25 the scalar @xmath26 is the simplest and most frequently used measure of the relative significance of the weyl and ricci curvature and becomes important in probing the wch .",
    "a discussion of @xmath26 and related ratios in a similar context and of their possible significance as a measure of gravitational entropy may be found in @xcite and references therein .",
    "the above ratios offer the desired initial asymptotic isotropy ; the framework of the ips therefore provides a formalisation for _ quiescent cosmology _ and the wch , at least for the initial state of the universe , and it is the combination of definitions [ isdef1.def ] and [ fluidflow1.def ] which we mean when we refer to the ips .",
    "since the definition does not necessarily imply an exact initial isotropy , there is room for cosmologies with an anisotropic future evolution , in which we are subsequently mainly interested .",
    "there are a number of other significant physical implications of this definition e.g. , a possible implementation of galaxy formation into the theory , explanations for the _ uniqueness _ and _ flatness problem _ @xcite and information about curvature and the kinematics @xcite .",
    "it was also argued that _",
    "quiescent cosmology _ once formulated in the framework of the ips may be a viable alternative scenario to cosmic inflation @xcite .",
    "furthermore , much is already known about the characterising feature for an ips to occur in a cosmology @xcite .",
    "a list of example cosmologies which admit an ips may be found in @xcite .    in spite of this success for giving a framework for a possible initial state of the universe",
    ", the definition of an ips does not guarantee a future evolution of a respective cosmology which is compatible with the ideas of the wch and _ quiescent cosmology_. projecting these ideas forward in time , it is clear that the local degree of clumping of matter , and therefore the local anisotropy , in the universe must increase if the cosmological future is to be a high - entropy state . since frw universes are globally isotropic and a subclass of them admit an ips @xcite , it becomes clear that the definition of an ips is not sufficient , in itself , to guarantee a future evolution which is consistent with the wch .    consequently , to complete the formalisation of _ quiescent cosmology _ and the wch , it is also necessary to encode possible final states of our universe , thereby providing a possible full mathematical formulation of these two schools of thought for the first time .",
    "we need a complementary framework which is independent of models , coordinates and the equation of state of the source of the gravitational field .",
    "in fact , since a recollapsing , as well as an ever - expanding universe are both compatible with our current knowledge of the universe , we would like to find , ideally , new geometric definitions covering both scenarios .    in order to devise a new framework in terms of conformal structures , we begin , in section 2 , by analysing the connection between such conformal rescalings and the two types of isotropy discussed above , and showing that a completely regular conformal structure ( with vanishing or diverging conformal factor ) for an asymptotic state of the universe excludes the possibility that it is anisotropic .",
    "as further guidance and motivation for the construction of the new definitions , we explore , in section [ examples ] , four specific example cosmologies for their conformal relations .",
    "our promising new frameworks for cosmological futures are presented in section [ newdefs ] , in which definitions for both an anisotropic ever - expanding and an anisotropic recollapsing universe are given along with two definitions for isotropic cosmological futures .",
    "a new feature of the former two cases is the employment of conformal structures which are not completely regular .",
    "essential technical information about conformal factors , which is necessary in proving implications of these conformal structures , but does not represent the key information of the main body of this article , is given in [ conffac ] .",
    "our discourse will close in section [ discussion ] with a summary of the presented work , a discussion about its relation to other approaches  in particular to the somewhat dual dynamical systems approach  and other asymptotic scenarios , as well as an outlook to a forthcoming paper . for",
    "reasons of space the present article will solely display the results forming the foundation of the new framework , while the second paper will demonstrate the derivation of results and implications using the new definitions and provide further example cosmologies .",
    "a brief outline of this topic may furthermore be found in the essay @xcite .",
    "in this section we will analyse the relation between conformal structures , with a conformal factor which is merely a function of cosmic time , and the two types of isotropy mentioned above .",
    "we will use reasonable constraints on the conformal factor , e.g. , we want to avoid an oscillatory behaviour of it near @xmath10 and require a monotonic behaviour .",
    "pathological behaviour of the physical metric shall again be entirely encoded in the conformal factor ; this time , however , we will treat the cases of both a vanishing and a diverging conformal factor for @xmath27 in the remainder of this article ( the limit may be taken along the flow lines of the cosmological fluid ) . ] .",
    "furthermore , we will cover both initial and final cosmological scenarios in this section , i.e. , the cosmic time function is allowed to approach @xmath28 from above ( initial state ) or below ( final state ) .",
    "interestingly , the asymptotic isotropy expressed in the ratios of ( [ k.eqn ] ) and ( [ kiniso.eqn ] ) holds in all these cases .",
    "we begin by analysing the relative significance of the weyl to the ricci curvature in terms of the scalar @xmath26 ( see ( [ k.eqn ] ) ) .",

    "consequently , we can infer that conformal structures for less symmetric asymptotic states , such as asymptotically anisotropic cosmological futures , are required to be significantly different and to involve irregularities , such as e.g. , degeneracy .",
    "in particular , this leads us to the important conclusion that : if we are to follow the ideas of _ quiescent cosmology _ and the wch with conformal structures involving a conformal factor which is a function of cosmic time , then choosing a conformal structure with regular conformal metric for the initial state of the universe necessarily produces the desired asymptotic isotropy and a conformal structure with irregular conformal metric is required for the anisotropic future infinity or future singularity of the universe . for the latter cases , the analytical advantage of the ips definition can not be sustained in the previous manner . in the forthcoming article , however , we will provide evidence that such degenerate structures are , in fact , useful @xcite .",
    "the kinematic and curvature quantities do not necessarily show a behaviour which is compatible with a cosmological singularity in the case @xmath79 , e.g. , @xmath22 and @xmath51 do not , in general , diverge . on the other hand ,",
    "the case @xmath45 necessarily leads to a singular behaviour of the physical quantities , independently of whether @xmath2 approaches @xmath28 from below or above .",
    "this state of affairs justifies the definition of an ips , which involves the choice of @xmath41 ( instead of @xmath79 ) and of a regular conformal metric , by indicating that the form of a conformal structure with the desired isotropic and singular physical implications is fairly constrained .",
    "the presented line of arguments is furthermore important for the general understanding of the problem ; it puts the ips in a broader context and emphasises its special nature from a geometric point of view by implying that different conditions in the conformal structure either possibly lead to less symmetry or to an isotropic asymptotic state which does not necessarily correspond to a singularity .",
    "the analysis of some example cosmological models will explicitly demonstrate the conclusions of this section and provide further guidance in elaborating a new framework .",
    "specific example space - times provide valuable guidance and motivation in the elaboration of reasonable definitions for cosmological futures .",
    "we will therefore probe a few example cosmological models for conformal rescalings with a conformal factor as a function of a cosmic time and for the ( an)isotropic behaviour of the kinematic and curvature quantities at the respective cosmological futures .",
    "examining proper time along the fluid flow will become useful in determining whether a metric pathology occurring at the cosmological future actually corresponds to a physical space - time singularity , i.e. , whether it occurs at finite or infinite values of proper time along the flow .",
    "the proper time @xmath80 for a timelike curve with tangent vector @xmath81 and parametrisation @xmath82 is given by @xmath83 if the fluid flow is parametrised by @xmath80 , we find that @xmath84 .",
    "all the cosmological models to follow are presented in comoving normal coordinates , hence proper time along the ( normalised ) fluid flow can be determined via @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the comoving coordinate time and @xmath87 can be obtained from the components for @xmath20 .",
    "several scalar quantities have been analysed with the aid of the program grtensorii which runs under maple .",
    "since some calculations are somewhat extensive , only the results will be presented here .",

    "nevertheless , due to the inherent continuity of the conformal metric and the regularity of the reference fluid congruence in the unphysical space - time as @xmath248 , the conformal space - time is more regular than the physical space - time , which is very important analytically , allowing a number of physical properties regarding the associated final states of the universe to be derived , as will be seen in our forthcoming article @xcite . as in the case of the ips , where the physical metric becomes degenerate , the limits along the flow lines of the various scalar quantities constructed from curvature tensors and kinematic quantities",
    "have meaning as the cosmic time function approaches zero from below , irrespective of whether or not , due to the degeneracy of the metric , the scalar quantities concerned actually exist at @xmath103 . in view of the above , the requirement that the conformal metric be degenerate",
    "thus does not render the definitions of an afeu and an afs dysfunctional , in spite of the departure from the high degree of regularity built into the conformal techniques originally developed by penrose in the differential - topological context for characterisation of asymptotically - flat space - times and which were subsequently utilised in the ips - framework .",
    "the lesser degree of regularity required by the new definitions is indeed sufficient to prove important physical results , relating to the final states of the universe encoded by these definitions which can therefore be employed in a useful way in the geometric discussion of asymptotic states in a class of cosmologies .    in particular , by making use of the regularity of the unphysical reference congruence and the degeneracy , it is possible to derive matter independent physical results concerning the behaviour of the expansion @xmath22 at late times in the afeu / afs - framework .",
    "furthermore , the notion of strong curvature will be analysed and using the continuity and degeneracy of the new definitions it will be shown that , for a wide class of cosmologies admitting an afs , the singularity turns out to be a _ deformationally strong singularity _ for timelike geodesics , which provides some information about curvature and the geometric structure @xcite .",
    "it also underlines the final physical character of the afs .",
    "we emphasise that , along with the degeneracy of the conformal metric and the regularity of the unphysical fluid flow , the conformal factor plays a key role in the constructed frameworks . the results and conclusions of section [ confiso ]",
    "are based on its `` regular '' asymptotic differentiability and monotonicity properties and do not hold under different circumstances .",
    "utilising a conformal factor which satisfies different conditions , such as , e.g. , an oscillatory behaviour , might significantly alter conclusions and the physical properties of an associated conformal framework .",
    "additionally , we have already seen , that the requirements on the conformal factor , provided by the definitions , do not uniquely define it , but rather leave a considerable freedom in choosing it , which , in view of constructing a conformal structure for a specific cosmology , we regard as an advantage .    in the light of _ quiescent cosmology _ and the wch",
    "we are more interested in the definitions of an afeu and an afs . given that we have not made explicit use of an initial state in the construction of these definitions , we note that they should , in principal , also be compatible with inflationary cosmologies which evolve into asymptotically anisotropic cosmological futures .",
    "the examination of the precise degree of anisotropy in the afs and the afeu , still remains to be finalised .",
    "thus far , the analysed example cosmologies satisfying these definitions merely indicate that the afs and afeu admit a great variety of anisotropic future evolutions @xcite .    at this point",
    "we would like to comment briefly on the relationship of the present framework to another approach , which has been in vogue during the last years , namely the _ dynamical systems approach _ @xcite .",
    "both approaches are based on conformal rescalings and exhibit a certain `` duality '' in their features , as we will point out in the sequel .",
    "while the choice of a conformal factor in the afeu / afs - framework is of a rather mathematical nature with the aim to render the conformal metric non - singular ( although degenerate ) and thereby does not usually equip the conformal factor with a particular dimension ( the choices in the kantowski and kantowski - sachs models were dimensionless ) , the motivation for the conformal factor in the dynamical systems approach has a physical basis . in order to regularise the efe in the vicinity of singularities via conformal rescalings ,",
    "the raychaudhuri equation and singularity theorems suggest that it is often advantageous to employ a conformal factor which is proportional to @xmath249 @xcite , thereby factoring out the dominant scale , as well as providing the conformal factor with the dimension `` length '' and rendering the conformal metric dimensionless @xcite .",
    "this choice yields a state space and a set of regularised dimensionless equations for expansion - normalised variables , which are equivalent to the efe and from which the dynamical equations for the conformal factor , i.e. , equivalently @xmath22 , decouple .",
    "it is therefore the reduced dimensionless system which contains the essential physical dynamics ( this is related to the infamous conformal mode problem which appears in quantum gravity approaches ) .",
    "this choice , furthermore , underlines the role of _ self - similar _ , i.e. , scale - invariant , solutions as important building blocks for the understanding of non - scale - invariant solutions since the former correspond to equilibrium points in state space ( hence the dynamical systems approach is also referred to as the _ conformal scale - invariant method _ ) @xcite . whereas the conformal factor of the dynamical systems approach vanishes towards a singularity and diverges in the ever - expanding case , the conformal factor of the afeu / afs - framework carries the diverging properties of the metric in both scenarios .",
    "the central object of the dynamical systems approach is the conformal contravariant 3-metric ( or equivalently the hubble - normalised spatial frame components ) and the analysis focuses on the regularised efe and an associated state space .",
    "the central objects of the new framework presented in this article , on the other hand , are the conformal covariant metric , the conformal factor and , when it comes to matter dynamics , the conformal reference fluid , and the focus of the new approach lies rather in the conformal geometry .",
    "the asymptotics further emphasise the `` duality '' .",
    "the hubble - normalisation in dynamical systems goes in hand with introducing a new dimensionless unphysical time parameter which takes an infinite value at asymptotic states @xcite .",
    "this stands in contrast to our framework , which maps the cosmological futures to finite cosmic time values ( i.e. , @xmath103 ) .",
    "the dynamical systems approach therefore effectively pushes the singularity away to infinity , while we adopt the strategy from asymptotically - flat space - times of `` pulling in '' the cosmological futures to a finite place .",
    "finally , the asymptotic behaviour of the conformal spatial metric highlights the `` duality '' of the two approaches . on the one hand , the conformal covariant spatial metric of the dynamical systems method becomes singular on approach to a generic initial singularity ( and to an ips as well ) while the conformal contravariant spatial metric becomes degenerate @xcite .",
    "this reflects asymptotic causal properties and is related to _",
    "asymptotic silence _",
    "( see below ) . on the other hand , in a suitable frame , the conditions of both the afeu- and afs - definition translate into the opposite behaviour , namely a degenerate conformal covariant spatial metric and a singular conformal contravariant spatial metric .",
    "we therefore see , that degeneracy already plays an essential role in another conformal approach , even though this degeneracy is dual to the one introduced in the present article .",
    "the dynamical systems approach has advantages when performing an asymptotic analysis of the efe in the state space , since , due to the regularisation , one is dealing with finite - valued variables .",
    "this has been successfully employed in the spatially homogeneous context @xcite and was promisingly extended to the inhomogeneous case and the generic analysis of cosmological initial singularities @xcite . nevertheless , this technique also has disadvantages when compared to the newly constructed framework of this paper .",
    "for instance , the conformal structure of the ips leads to advantages when formulating the initial value problem ( see @xcite and references therein ) and the non - singular behaviour of the conformal covariant metric of the afeu / afs - framework might offer advantages for numerical simulations when compared to the dynamical systems approach .",
    "lastly , the new conformal structures , certainly , provide advantages for the geometric discussion of asymptotic structures , as is explicitly illustrated by the possibility of deriving results concerning the notion of strong curvature in the afs scenario @xcite .    the `` dual '' relationship between these two approaches is thus of considerable interest to relativistic cosmology and , consequently , warrants more research .",
    "the dynamical systems techniques are , moreover , mostly applied to the simplified case of a perfect fluid with a linear barotropic equation of state ( polytrope ) in which case the inhomogeneous cosmologies admitting an ips could be accommodated in the state space @xcite .",
    "analogously , it should also be possible to accommodate and analyse cosmologies satisfying the presented new definitions in the dynamical systems state space , once restricted to polytropic perfect fluids and a suitable reformulation of the new definitions has been performed .",
    "we now briefly return to the notion of _ self - similarity _ and _ asymptotic silence_. the homogeneous example cosmologies presented in this article are known to be asymptotically self - similar which means that these solutions are asymptotic to a self - similar , i.e. , scale - invariant , solution of the efe @xcite . since it has recently been shown that _",
    "asymptotic self - similarity breaking _ occurs generically ( in different ways ) at both the initial singularity and towards the cosmological future for spatially homogeneous cosmologies @xcite , it seems reasonable that this state of affairs will hold in the more general inhomogeneous context as well , and therefore one might wonder whether the definitions of an afeu and an afs , together with their example cosmologies , may be misleading for the generic case . in our forthcoming article @xcite , however , we will display an inhomogeneous afeu - example model , which is _ not _ asymptotically self - similar . the conformal framework presented in this article",
    "is hence indeed relevant to a rather generic scenario .",
    "the general significance of asymptotic self - similarity breaking in afeu- and afs - cosmologies is an interesting topic and requires further investigation .",
    "likewise , it is of interest to elaborate the relation of the afs to _ asymptotic silence _ and its breaking .",
    "asymptotic silence means that communication is interrupted due to vanishing particle horizons which form on approach to the singularity as a consequence of strong gravity effects and is related to the vanishing of the hubble - normalised spatial frame components @xcite and conformal properties @xcite .",
    "the kantowski - sachs solution , i.e. , the afs example , is asymptotically silent at @xmath103 , since the hubble - normalised spatial frame components vanish .",
    "the opposite scenario , namely asymptotic silence breaking , has been found at special initial singularities @xcite .",
    "current research indicates , however , that generic initial singularities are asymptotically silent @xcite , while the possibility of asymptotic silence breaking at a future singularity has not been sufficiently investigated to already discuss the relevance of this scenario to the afs at this point .",
    "we leave this question open for future research .    finally , since , from our current knowledge of the universe , it is not clear whether our universe will expand indefinitely or recollapse in finite future time , we suggest that the definitions of an afeu and an afs should both be regarded as a completion to the definition of an ips , and conjecture that the conjunction of these definitions provides a possible version of a complete mathematical formalisation of _ quiescent cosmology _ and the wch .",
    "a number of technical properties of a monotonic conformal factor , which is a function of a cosmic time function @xmath2 , are necessary for the derivation and proofs of several implications of the employed conformal structures , e.g. , of the results of section [ confiso ] , which will be proven in the following appendix .",
    "the quick reader may skip this rather technical appendix and jump straight to [ proofs ] and refer back to the following lemmas once going through the proofs of the above mentioned results .    in this appendix we will examine the existence and the possible values of the limit of several ratios of the conformal factor and its derivatives .",
    "some technicalities , concerning the conformal factor in the new definitions of section [ newdefs ] , will subsequently become clear .",
