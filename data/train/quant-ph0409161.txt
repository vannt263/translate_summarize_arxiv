    "more than a decade ago , huttner and barnett @xcite published a valuable contribution to the complicated and long - established @xcite subject of quantum electrodynamics in nonrelativistic macroscopic matter .",
    "opting for a canonical setting , they carried out a fundamental derivation of the quantised electromagnetic field in an absorptive dielectric medium . to open up the possibility of working analytically",
    ", they avoided making direct contact with the atomic level .",
    "instead , they described the properties of the dielectric with the help of harmonic oscillators .",
    "the influence of absorption was mimicked by coupling the dielectric to a continuum of harmonic oscillators .",
    "these reasonable simplifications gave rise to a so - called damped - polariton model that could be exactly solved .",
    "the quadratic hamiltonian was diagonalised by means of fano s method @xcite and fourier transformation .",
    "the solution for the quantised electromagnetic field in an absorptive dielectric was welcomed by a large community .",
    "phenomenological quantisation schemes , the practical value of which was beyond dispute , could be put on a solid microscopic foundation .",
    "this possibility marked the beginning of a period of progress , in which our knowledge of qed in or near macroscopic matter was considerably broadened .",
    "for a lot of different optical media and experimental geometries , ranging from magnetic materials to beam splitters , quantisation of the electromagnetic field was successfully carried out . at present , the macroscopic formulation of qed is well established .",
    "a few years ago , it was comprehensively reviewed @xcite .    over the years , it was pointed out several times @xcite that the justification of huttner and barnett has one major shortcoming .",
    "the dielectric is assumed to be homogeneous in space , whereas in many experimental situations the electromagnetic field is substantially influenced by spatial inhomogeneities .",
    "one thus would like to extend the solution of the homogeneous damped - polariton model to the case in which all model parameters depend on position .",
    "this is a far from trivial enterprise , because the lack of translational invariance deprives us of the possibility to perform fourier transformation . on the other hand ,",
    "the quadratic character of the hamiltonian remains intact , so there are no mathematical indications for a failure of fano s procedure when passing over to the inhomogeneous case .",
    "indeed , in two companion papers it is demonstrated that the inhomogeneous damped - polariton model can be solved as well .",
    "one can employ either fano s procedure @xcite , or an alternative method that is based on laplace transformation @xcite .",
    "the extension of the work of huttner and barnett to dielectrics with spatial inhomogeneities does not complete the program of underpinning phenomenological quantisation rules .",
    "this judgement , which is the main motivation for undertaking the present study , is supported by several arguments .",
    "first , standard works on conservative qed @xcite@xcite and classical fields @xcite insist on reducing the collection of canonical variables to an enumerable lot before commencing a canonical quantisation procedure . in doing so for the inhomogeneous case ,",
    "we are automatically led to a complete set of normal - mode functions , on the basis of which the electromagnetic fields can be expanded .",
    "we thus identify the functions that replace the plane waves of the homogeneous case .",
    "moreover , we find the natural decomposition of the green function @xcite belonging to the wave equation for the electric field .",
    "our second reservation with regard to the damped - polariton model concerns the loss mechanism . instead of employing a continuum of oscillators right from the beginning",
    ", we should postpone the transition to the continuum as long as possible .",
    "this allows for a scrutiny of the mathematical origin of the absorptive behaviour . also , we can completely clarify the relation between irreversibility of the dynamics and causality of the dielectric constant .",
    "our third argument pertains to a technical observation on fano s method in the presence of continua . in solving for",
    "the diagonalising operators one must introduce a formal contribution that is proportional to a dirac delta function .",
    "we wish to improve upon this approach . to that end , we must refrain from employing distributions @xcite .",
    "fourth and last , we remark that already back in the 1960s quantum dissipation was studied with the help of harmonic oscillators @xcite@xcite .",
    "it is important to find out whether the older oscillator models corroborate the predictions of the damped - polariton model .",
    "we can meet the four suggestions advanced above by exchanging the continuum of the damped - polariton model for a reservoir containing a finite collection of independent harmonic oscillators .",
    "in essence , we add an electromagnetic sector to the ullersma model @xcite for a damped harmonic oscillator . as expected , we can still diagonalise the hamiltonian of the extended ullersma model . eventually , we come up with a mathematical limit that restores the continuum .    in section 2",
    "we specify the hamiltonian of our model . in preparation of a swift canonical quantisation procedure",
    ", we solve the classical evolution equations for the canonical fields by invoking a normal - mode expansion .",
    "quantisation of the dynamics happens in section 3 . with each normal mode",
    "we associate a quantised harmonic oscillator .",
    "next , making use of complex integration , we determine the evolution in time of all canonical fields .",
    "this permits us to identify the dielectric constant as well as the green function .",
    "subsequently , we turn on absorption by subjecting the reservoir to a continuum limit .",
    "we witness how poles unite and radically change the analytic structure of both the dielectric constant and the green function .",
    "we derive the inhomogeneous counterpart of the solution that was obtained by huttner and barnett .",
    "much attention is devoted to the long - time behaviour of the electric field .",
    "section 4 contains a summary and guides the reader to the main results of our paper .",
    "we close this introduction with some technical remarks . in performing partial integrations for canonical fields and related quantities ,",
    "we tacitly assume that there are no contributions from the boundaries of the dielectric .",
    "our aim to keep the treatment free from distributions forces us to utilise a considerable amount of basic function theory ; all of the accompanying calculus is transferred to two appendices . in an attempt to present clear formulas ,",
    "we omit spatial arguments whenever possible .",
    "the subscript @xmath0 denotes that one should take the longitudinal ( transverse ) part of a vector field or tensor field .",
    "last , we make use of rationalised mks units throughout .",
    "in this section we derive the classical hamiltonian of our model .",
    "we let us be guided by the lagrange formalism , so our treatment bears a canonical character from the very outset . as usual , hamilton s equations furnish the evolution laws for the canonical fields .",
    "in solving these , we rely on a normal - mode expansion .",
    "it appears that the dynamics is governed by an eigenvalue problem for a self - adjoint differential operator in three dimensions . for a spatially homogeneous dielectric",
    "the eigenvectors can be constructed from plane waves . to verify that the normal modes neatly decouple ,",
    "we compute the hamiltonian on the basis of the solutions for the canonical fields .      the ullersma model @xcite describes the interaction between a single harmonic oscillator and a reservoir made up by an array of @xmath1 independent harmonic oscillators . to fulfil our purposes",
    ", we assign to all @xmath2 oscillators a spatial dependence .",
    "the corresponding position vector @xmath3 covers a finite volume @xmath4 . as a further extension of the ullersma configuration",
    "we introduce an electromagnetic sector , denoting the electric field and magnetic field at time @xmath5 as @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively . in vacuum",
    "these fields give rise to the standard electromagnetic lagrangean density @xmath8 the presence of a dielectric medium of volume @xmath4 is taken into account by the privileged harmonic oscillator of the extended ullersma model .",
    "it has mass density @xmath9 and frequency @xmath10 .",
    "the field @xmath11 measures its displacement .",
    "the lagrangean density of the dielectric reads @xmath12 after suitable scaling , all harmonic oscillators of the reservoir have a mass density of @xmath9 as well .",
    "their frequencies and displacement fields are equal to @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively . from ( [ 2 ] )",
    "we see that @xmath15 is the lagrangean density of the free reservoir .    in the electric - dipole approximation",
    "the electric field induces in the dielectric a polarisation density @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is positive . in a strictly microscopic theory",
    "@xmath18 would be a local electronic charge density .",
    "the interaction between the electromagnetic fields and the dielectric yields a contribution of @xmath19 to the lagrangean density . in absence of free charges and currents",
    ", one may substitute @xmath20 and @xmath21 for the sources .",
    "the electromagnetic potentials are determined by the definitions @xmath22 and @xmath23 , supplemented with the choice @xmath24 , which is equivalent to the coulomb gauge .",
    "as long as it allows for energy exchange , the precise form of the interaction between the dielectric and the reservoir is not of physical interest to us . introducing a coupling @xmath25 , we link the displacement field @xmath26 to the time derivative @xmath27 rather than the field @xmath28 itself .",
    "this departure from the ullersma model is common in studies of dissipative qed @xcite .",
    "the two interactions of our model make the following contribution to the lagrangean density : @xmath29 we have added the total derivative @xmath30 , so that the nabla operator acts on the scalar potential .    as the lagrangean @xmath31 does not depend on @xmath32 , one immediately finds @xmath33 from the corresponding euler - lagrange equation . owing to the coulomb gauge , the character of the first term of ( [ 4 ] ) is purely electrostatic .",
    "the remaining euler - lagrange equations provide us with the inhomogeneous maxwell equation for the vector potential , and the equations of motion for all @xmath2 displacement fields .",
    "defining canonical momenta as @xmath34 for @xmath35 , we obtain the hamiltonian @xmath36 as @xmath37 @xmath38 .",
    "\\label{7}\\ ] ] for the sum @xmath39 the abbreviation @xmath40 will be in use .",
    "the hamiltonian of our model being available , we can start investigating the evolution of the canonical fields .",
    "since we work in a finite volume , we may try to unravel the dynamics with the help of an enumerable set of independent normal modes .",
    "we shall see that each mode has a specific spatial structure and oscillates at a specific frequency .",
    "for that reason , the modes must be labelled by both a spatial index @xmath41 and an integer @xmath42 , which enumerates the mode frequencies @xmath43 for @xmath41 fixed .",
    "the index @xmath44 identifies the canonical fields with the auxiliary fields @xmath45 in the following manner : @xmath46 with @xmath47 .",
    "now we can put forward our normal - mode expansion @xmath48 the frequencies @xmath43 are positive by definition .",
    "the coefficients @xmath49 could be absorbed in the mode amplitudes @xmath50 , but this is inconvenient in view of the quantisation procedure lying ahead of us . because of the coulomb gauge the amplitudes @xmath51 and @xmath52 are transverse vector fields .    upon substituting ( [ 9 ] ) into hamilton s equations and carefully evaluating functional derivatives ,",
    "one arrives at @xmath53 with @xmath54 .",
    "the arguments of @xmath50 and @xmath55 are identical to those appearing in ( [ 9 ] ) .",

    "the expansion @xmath61 should match with the definition of @xmath62 in terms of the electromagnetic potentials .",

    "second , its eigenvectors @xmath75 possess the orthonormality property @xmath76 obviously , ( [ 21 ] ) is not affected by degeneracy .",
    "eigenspaces of higher dimension should be subjected to an orthonormalisation procedure .",

    "we have a decomposition of the tensorial delta function at our disposal , given by @xmath77 the reality of the left - hand side follows from the invariance of the tensorial delta function under interchange of its arguments and indices .",
    "last , as @xmath73 is quadratic in the parameter @xmath67 , the eigenvectors for @xmath67 and @xmath78 can be chosen identical to each other , so that the relation @xmath79 may be assumed .    of course , for @xmath67 equal to a mode frequency @xmath55 , the eigenvalue problem @xmath80 should be in keeping with the wave equation ( [ 14a ] ) .",

    "they are fuelled by the energy that is available in the reservoir .",
    "the quantisation of the electromagnetic field in the presence of nonrelativistic macroscopic matter constitutes a problem of formidable magnitude . in principle , any serious treatment should start from the minimal - coupling hamiltonian that takes into account all electromagnetic interactions at the atomic level .",
    "it needs no argument that such a rigorous approach is scarcely possible , unless one is prepared to deploy heavy numerical means as soon as it comes to predicting experimental findings .",
    "however , one then misses the opportunity to see what kind of mathematical mechanisms are at work behind such processes as spontaneous emission or scattering of photons .",
    "therefore , already during the early years of the subject people were looking for shortcuts so as to obtain concise and transparent theories @xcite . nowadays a generally accepted quantisation scheme of phenomenological nature is available .",
    "because of their experimental relevance , rules for qed in absorptive matter deserve to be put on a firm foundation .",
    "this idea was pursued by huttner and barnett @xcite .",
    "sacrificing the direct contact with the atomic level , they solved a so - called damped - polariton model .",
    "their microscopic expression for the quantised electromagnetic field in an absorptive dielectric initiated a lot of activity on the construction of phenomenological quantisation rules . despite this progress , a for experimentalists most important issue is still pending , namely , the microscopic quantisation in a dielectric with both spatial inhomogeneities and losses .",
    "in addition to that , it is unclear how the damped - polariton model relates to the old oscillator models for dissipative quantum dynamics that were proposed in the 1960s @xcite@xcite .    motivated by the last remarks , we exchange in this work the continuum of the damped - polariton model for a reservoir that consists of a finite number of independent harmonic oscillators . we thus consider the ullersma configuration @xcite , extended with an electromagnetic sector . for all parameters",
    "a spatial dependence is admitted , so that the oscillator model at hand is capable of describing spatial inhomogeneities . to give the reader the chance to make a direct comparison between the quantum and the classical evolution of the model , we first solve hamilton s equations for the classical canonical fields .",
    "the latter are expressed as sums of independent normal modes . by associating with each normal mode a harmonic oscillator",
    ", we can invoke dirac s method for the quantisation of the dynamics .",
    "the corresponding ladder operators can be employed to cast the hamiltonian into diagonal form .",
    "hence , the time evolution of all fields can be made explicit .",
    "having derived the solution of the extended ullersma model , we can identify the inhomogeneous dielectric function .",
    "also , we can meet one of our prime objectives , the generalisation of the results of huttner and barnett @xcite to the case of an inhomogeneous dielectric .",
    "this job is completed by subjecting our discrete reservoir to a continuum limit , which makes the coupling parameter of each separate oscillator infinitely weak , and at the same time converts the collection of eigenfrequencies into a dense set .",
    "the discrete character of the ullersma reservoir brings us important advantages .",
    "we can completely avoid the mathematical complexities that accompany the use of distributions .",
    "for example , we need not adapt the solution of the evolution equations through addition of an unknown term , containing a delta function @xcite . to derive the results of this paper only simple technical tools are required .",
    "we apply linear algebra to prove orthogonality and completeness for the eigenvectors of operator @xmath113 , which governs the spatial structure of the normal modes .",
    "hence , these eigenvectors are the natural candidates for composing the green function , as becomes manifest when computing the solutions for the canonical fields .",
    "the other standard ingredient we call in , is the residue theorem .",
    "it allows us to reduce all discrete sums of normal modes to complex integrals .",
    "the ensuing contour @xmath142 is rather awkward , as it is composed of separate circles around poles on the real axis .",
    "fortunately , @xmath142 gives way to frequency integrals upon performing contour deformation .",
    "in doing so , we generate correction terms of local nature , in which the green function no longer figures .",
    "these terms can be interpreted as langevin noise operators @xcite .",
    "the local correction to the electric displacement ensures that the divergence of the latter equals zero , in accordance with maxwell s equations .",
    "the easy access to the mathematical structure of our solutions enables us to scrutinise their behaviour under the continuum limit .",
    "the function @xmath96 plays a central role .",
    "its poles gradually cover the real axis , and finally give rise to a branch cut .",
    "the dielectric function is analytic on both sides of the cut , but the sign of the time @xmath5 determines on which branch the fields differ from zero .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that ( anti)causality of the dielectric function is intimately linked to irreversibility of the dynamics for @xmath5 approaching ( minus ) infinity .",
    "a further advantage offered by the ullersma reservoir is the connection with recent work on decoherence and entanglement .",
    "several papers describe how a reservoir of the ullersma type can bring about decoherence of quantum superpositions and entanglement between qubits @xcite@xcite .",
    "results on these processes are valuable with an eye to quantum computing and other future applications .",
    "inevitably , in any real device electromagnetic fields will participate in the interactions .",
    "therefore , it would be worthwhile to study the reservoir - induced quantum phenomena in the presence of an electromagnetic sector",
    ". one would like to assess the influence of the quantum noise that is produced by the electromagnetic field . as we saw in this work , the energy density of the reservoir fuels the quantum fluctuations of the electric field .",
    "they outlive any decoherence or entanglement .",
    "the possible fragility of these quantum processes can surely be investigated with the aid of the extended ullersma model .",
    "especially the influence of temperature must be critically regarded .",
    "in the main text we exploited some analytic properties of the functions @xmath261 , @xmath182 , and @xmath262 . for the first two functions , all properties can be proved by means of simple techniques , as we shall discuss below .",
    "when we turn to @xmath262 , however , the going becomes heavier , due to the fact that the partial differential equation ( [ 16 ] ) intervenes .",
    "we shall need a few plausibility arguments in order to make progress . a rigorous mathematical investigation of ( [ 16 ] )",
    "lies outside the scope of this paper .",
    "the function @xmath261 , defined in ( [ 14 ] ) , is equal to the ratio of two finite polynomials in @xmath136 .",

    "as long as @xmath272 differs from zero , the factor of @xmath273 can not render the denominator of ( [ 50 ] ) zero .",
    "this guarantees that @xmath271 is analytic outside the real axis , i.e. , on each of its two branches .",
    "since @xmath271 is obtained by applying a limiting process to @xmath261 , the inequalities ( [ a2 ] ) and ( [ a3 ] ) are valid for @xmath271 as well",

    "as is manifest from ( [ 18 ] ) , the dependence of the operator @xmath279 on the real variable @xmath67 is smooth , except for the points where @xmath280 equals zero .",
    "the corresponding divergencies do not appear in @xmath281 , owing to the normalisation ( [ 21 ] ) .",
