    "our knowledge of the physical conditions during the very early phases of high - mass star formation ( @xmath4 ) has been relatively limited in the past ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "consequently , the qualitative and quantitative differences in star - formation processes over different mass regimes are still strongly debated ( cf . * ? ? ?",

    "to enhance our understanding of star formation beyond the well - studied low mass stellar nurseries , infrared dark clouds ( irdcs ) have become more and more important targets .",

    "irdcs were widely discussed in the context of massive star formation , but a certain fraction of irdcs only host sub - solar to intermediate - mass star formation @xcite .",
    "still , @xcite argue that most stars in our galaxy could form in irdc - like molecular structures .",
    "most of the current theories about the formation of irdcs treat the collapsing gaseous medium as isothermal . with the _ herschel _ observatory",
    ", we have the spatial resolving power , spectral coverage , sensitivity and dynamic range to study the temperature and column density structure of irdcs in more detail .",
    "already one of the early _ herschel _ studies using spatially resolved sed fitting toward an irdc indicated a non - isothermal temperature structure @xcite .",
    "@xcite compared _ herschel _ observations of irdcs without embedded ir sources to radiative transfer models of strictly externally heated structures .",
    "they find resulting temperature profiles that go down to 11.5k ( sample average ) in the center .",
    "two further studies analyzed the temperature structure using sed - fitting and a modified blackbody model .",
    "@xcite present large scale temperature maps of irdcs . @xcite studied the irdc18454 near the w43 mini - starburst and present dust temperature maps .",
    "both studies found temperatures higher by more than 5k compared to the irdcs from @xcite .",
    "further investigations have to clarify if the majority of irdcs show similar minimum temperatures or if clumps with higher central temperatures exist .",
    "this classification is essential for the understanding of the formation process of massive stars .",
    "the comparison between dust and gas temperatures can shed light on the efficiency of the gas - dust coupling at densities typical for irdcs .",
    "furthermore , a well constrained dust temperature structure can provide critical input for chemical models of irdcs , and in particular for the dust grain surface reactions .",
    "the goal of this paper is to accurately characterize the physical conditions of ( high - mass ) star formation in a relatively isolated irdc , g048.66@xmath80.29 ( henceforth called `` 48 '' ) .",
    "this case study is based on observations taken as part of the earliest phases of star formation ( epos ) herschel guaranteed time key program @xcite .",
    "we present sub - parsec scale dust temperature and column density maps and place these properties in context with the kinematic environment , probed by various molecular gas tracers ( , , , , ) .",
    "herschel also enables us to characterize the embedded protostellar core population and , through the use of evolutionary models , try to understand the likely outcome of star formation in this cloud .",
    "the kinematic distance to 48 was determined to be @xmath9kpc @xcite 2.5kpc @xcite or 2.6kpc ( this work ) .",
    "48 appears to be projected near the gmc w51 ( figure [ fig : rgb_overview ] , left ) , which is in fact twice as distant as 48 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also section [ sec : dist ] ) .",
    "48 appears isolated ; and therefore we can assume it is not strongly influenced by local heating sources .",
    "furthermore 48 has a quite simple monofilamentary structure . by comparing the observational results from this isolated irdc to more complex irdcs ( c.f .",
    "* ) , we can constrain the dominant effects at work for star formation in irdcs . @xcite",
    "estimated from 3co observations an average density for h@xmath10 associated with 48 of @xmath11 , a peak column density of @xmath12 and a lte mass of @xmath13 .",
    "@xcite identified three different clumps with masses from 91 to @xmath14 using scuba and msx observations . by modeling the internal velocity structure of these clumps using @xmath15 and @xmath16 single - dish data they found that the line - widths decrease outside the cloud , indicating a decrease in turbulent motions outwards of the clumps .",
    "this suggests that the star formation activity inside these clumps down to the core scale is driven by turbulence .",
    "@xcite identified 13 ysos in the vicinity of 48 , based on _ spitzer _ mid - infrared maps .",
    "the majority of these objects belong to `` stage i '' , referring to the classification scheme of @xcite , and have low to intermediate masses . from a comparison of [ ci ] and data , @xcite inferred the presence of a young photodissociation region ( pdr ) ionized by the ysos inside of 48 .    throughout the literature",
    "the limits of sizes and masses for clumps and cores vary . in this work the spatial definition from @xcite is applied : cores range from @xmath17pc , while clumps extend over @xmath18pc .",
    "given the isolated nature and simple structure of 48 , we use this source to study the collapse and fragmentation of a filamentary irdc . through the characterization of the point sources the evolutionary stage",
    "can be assessed a final stellar mass can be estimated from different models .",
    "furthermore , the _ herschel _ maps are utilized to study the temperature and column density structure of 48 .",
    "molecular line observations provide information about the morphology of the clumps and clues to the pressure support therein .",
    "we assess the level of freeze - out by studying the co - depletion in the central part of the irdc .",

    "the sample includes a sub - sample of `` classical '' irdcs , a selection of irdcs in the near vicinity of high - mass proto - stellar objects ( hmpos ) and cold , massive , compact sources detected by the iso serendipity survey ( isoss ) . for a detailed discussion of this sample and the underlining selection strategy we refer the reader to the overview paper by @xcite .",
    "the epos observation were supplement with data from the the `` herschel infrared galactic plane survey '' ( hi - gal ) project , done with the photometer array camera and spectrometer ( pacs , * ? ? ? * ) and the spectral and photometric imaging receiver ( spire , * ? ? ? * ) on board of the _ herschel space observatory _ @xcite .",
    "the epos pacs scan maps at 70@xmath19 m , 100@xmath19 m and 160@xmath19 m were obtained with the medium scan speed of @xmath20/s and the nominal scan leg length of 7@xmath21 .",
    "the data were processed to level-1 , i.e. calibrated and converted to physical units , using hipe @xcite .",
    "we applied a second level deglitching to flag bad data values by @xmath22-clipping flux values mapped on to each pixel .",
    "the ` time ordered ' option was used , and a 25@xmath22-threshold was applied .",
    "the level-2 products , i.e. fully reduced fits maps , were obtained using scanamorphos @xcite version 5.0 instead of applying the nominal hipe highpass filtering and photproject reduction step , due to the improved performance of scanamorphos ( see * ? ? ? * ) . the maps in each band",
    "were reduced with a pixel - size of @xmath23/px .",
    "the epos spire scan maps at 250@xmath19 m , 350@xmath19 m and 500@xmath19 m were obtained with a scan speed of 30/s . they were reduced up to level-1 using hipe version 5.0with the calibration pool 5.1 .",

    "to include a larger coverage we obtained the raw data products from the hi - gal open time key project .",
    "these observations were carried out in the pacs / spire parallel mode with a scan speed of 60@xmath24/s , resulting in large scale maps .",

    "the pixel size is the same as for the epos spire maps .",
    "the final maps are presented in the left panel of figure [ fig : rgb_overview ] .",
    "the hi - gal maps are used for the temperature mapping in section [ sec : tmap ] .      due to the diffuse and heterogeneous background emission varying on a wide range of spatial scales , it is more robust to perform psf photometry than aperture photometry .",
    "therefore the ` starfinder ` psf photometry software @xcite was used for the point source detection and flux extraction for the pacs bands .",
    "the latest empirical psf of the vesta asteroid was used ( od 160 ) , obtained from the herschel science archive ( hsa ) , since an empirical psf derived from sources in 48 is noise dominated and therefore less acceptable . for consistency",
    "the psf maps were reprocessed with scanmorphos and rotated to the orientation of the maps .",
    "the noise in the pacs maps is not white noise , since it suffers from pixel - to - pixel correlations induced , e.g. , by non - thermal low - frequency noise . to calculate the average noise in the map",
    "a gaussian distributed noise was assumed , but corrected by a factor for the pixel - to - pixel correlation .",
    "the major source of confusion in the source detection is the complicated background .",
    "in particular the bright background towards the gmc returns numerous false detections . we only include regions of the pacs maps that correspond to regions in the atlasgal map ( see section [ sec : submm ] ) with fluxes above a @xmath25 level . to further improve the detection efficiency an unsharp - mask - filter was applied in each pacs - band by subtracting",
    "a median smoothed map from the respective science - frame . with this procedure",
    "we avoid false detections , and miss three obvious sources for the automated detection run .",
    "these sources were then included in the catalog identified by eye as clear detections . with the compiled fixed source positions the final photometry was performed on the non - filtered science frames .",
    "to be considered a detection a source must meet the following conditions : it must have a source flux above the @xmath26 noise level and be detected in all pacs bands within the fwhm of the 160@xmath19 m pacs psf ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the results of the point source extraction are reported in section [ sec : pointsrc ] .",
    "the given fluxes are already color - corrected for the source temperatures .",
    "further details of the source extraction are given in the epos high - mass overview paper @xcite .",
    "we obtained the _",
    "irac and mips maps from the galactic legacy infrared mid - plane survey extraordinaire ( glimpse , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the mips inner galactic plane survey ( mipsgal , * ? ? ?",
    "the 24@xmath19 m mipsgal maps were processed with the mips data analysis tool starting from the ` raw ` data products .",
    "we used the 8@xmath19 m irac map to create an extinction map .",
    "psf photometry was performed on this map , using the ` starfinder ` package .",
    "an averaged , empirical psf was used to remove all the point sources in this field .",
    "the residual map was used to compute the optical depths .",
    "one of the key problem in calculating an optical depth in ir data , is to determine the foreground and background intensities .",
    "several different methods are described in the literature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , to estimate the optical depth in one single cloud we used the method described in @xcite .",
    "@xmath28    where @xmath29 is the flux derived from the irdc directly , @xmath30 is measured of `` off - cloud '' in a nearby region meant to represent the characteristic unattenuated mir emission .",
    "@xmath30 ( and @xmath29 ) contains contributions from both the foreground and background ( i.e. @xmath31 ) , and only @xmath32 is needed to computed the optical depth . for @xmath33 , we assume the zodiacal light emission provided in the header of the irac data product .",
    "this is a lower limit to the true foreground .",
    "nevertheless , the uncertainties in the column densities are dominated by what is assumed about the extinction law ( factor 2 to 3 ) , whereas the @xmath33 contributes about an error less than 50% .",
    "the point - source fluxes from mips 24@xmath19 m used in section [ sec : pointsrc ] were also obtained with ` starfinder ` . for mips",

    "the background subtracted on - source spectrum and the background spectra from the off - source nod - positions is shown in figure [ fig : spec ] . only the long wavelength - order ( ll )",
    "is reduced , since the slit for the short wavelength did not cover any point source in the irdc .",
    "the ll slit did only cover about 60% of the smart - source psf , which leads to a flux leakage in the continuum flux .",
    "but line shapes and line fluxes should be unchanged for the source spectrum , except for a lower s / n - ratio .",
    "a strong [ siii ] emission appears over the whole irs - slit , leading to an artifact in the source spectrum due to an over - subtraction of the background .",
    "the source spectrum was corrected for this artifact using a polynomial background fit(see section 3.2.3 in * ? ? ?",
    "we utilized sub - millimeter data from the scuba legacy catalogue @xcite .",
    "the 450 and 850@xmath19 m observations were part of the fundamental catalog with a effective beamsize of @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively . given the better sensitivity of the survey , the 870@xmath19 m observations from the `` apex telescope large area survey of the galaxy '' ( atlasgal , * ? ? ?",

    ", we have tested the effect of simply amplifying those background levels by a factor of 100 . the resulting temperatures and column densities in the irdc",
    "were found to change by no more than 0.1k and 2.5% , respectively .",
    "the effect would be stronger for lower column densities , which we do not consider here .",
    "hence , we can robustly conclude that the effect of the uncertain knowledge in the absolute local background flux levels on the derived temperatures and column densities in the irdc is smaller than the uncertainties introduced by the calibration , data reduction , and dust opacity models , and is thus negligible .",
    "the total relative uncertainties introduced by calibration and data reduction are found to be 2.5% for the temperatures and",
    "10% for the column densities .",
    "the largest uncertainties are introduced by the uncertain knowledge of the underlying dust opacity model .",
    "therefore , we assume an overall temperature uncertainty of @xmath121k . a more detailed discussion of the different contributions to the uncertainties can be found in @xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned that the temperatures outside 48 are not very reliable because of the brightness gradient introduced by w51 and n100 , as mentioned earlier . in the column density and temperature maps ( figure [ fig : nh2_tmap ] )",
    "the point source positions and temperatures are indicated .",
    "the temperatures derived at the locations of the point sources in the large  scale temperature map are discrepant from the temperatures derived by fitting the individual seds of said point - sources , the later of which were extracted at native resolution .",
    "this discrepancy is not surprising as it is caused by beam convolution in the temperature map and the inclusion of longer wavelengths .      to estimate the column densities for 48 we utilized three different methods ; mid - infrared extinction map from irac at 8@xmath19 m , sub - millimeter dust emission and modified blackbody fitting including _ herschel _ and sub - millimeter data ( see section [ sec : tmap ] ) .",
    "the irac 8@xmath19 m extinction maps provides us with an estimate of the optical depth per pixel ( see section [ sec : obs_spitzer ] ) .",
    "these optical depths were converted into column densities ( figure [ fig : nh2_tmap ] , bottom left ) using @xcite : @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the optical depth per pixel and @xmath124 is the extinction cross - section .",
    "the nature of the mid - infrared extinction law below 10@xmath19 m in irdcs and massive star - forming regions is still a matter of debate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in agreement with findings of @xcite we used an extinction factor of @xmath125 to parametrize the extinction cross - section @xmath124 .",
    "we choose @xmath126 from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( case b ) ) .",
    "the derived column densities also depend on the assumed @xmath127 value and , therefore , the used extinction cross - section .",
    "the extinction factor @xmath128 is more representative of the diffuse ism and would result in significantly higher column densities .",
    "another effect for the 8@xmath19 m extinction is the saturation of the column density for high values , therefore the masses based on irac  8@xmath19 m discussed further below can only be lower limits ( for a detailed discussion , see * ? ? ?",
    "the second method to determine the hydrogen column densities utilizes the dust emission detected in the 870@xmath19 m map from atlasgal : @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the sub - millimeter flux , @xmath116 the gas - to - dust ratio , @xmath131 the planck function for a given wavelength ( 870@xmath19 m ) and dust temperature ( @xmath132k or 19.2k , see below ) , @xmath133 the mass per hydrogen molecule , and @xmath105 the beam size .",
    "we adopt a mass absorption coefficient of @xmath134cm@xmath94g@xmath44 from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* thin ice mantel , @xmath136@xmath115 , as in section [ sec : tmap ] ) .",
    "we have three independently derived column density maps : irac  8@xmath19 m , atlasgal 870@xmath19 m , and the sed fitted map combining _ herschel _ and atlasgal .",
    "each one requires us to make different and independent assumptions in order to derive column densities ; furthermore , they also vary widely in angular resolution .",
    "for example , the 8@xmath19 m extinction map , which has a resolution of @xmath137 , requires an assumption of a certain extinction factor for the dust extinction cross - section , optically thin emission and the local background contribution ( @xmath138 in equation [ eq : irac_tau ] ) , but is temperature independent .",
    "furthermore , the residuals of the psf removal for bright irac point - sources with compact background emission can result in an underestimate of local column density ( see e.g. , source 1 in figure [ fig : nh2_tmap ] , top left ) .    for the atlasgal 870@xmath19 m map , with a resolution of @xmath139  , always a fixed temperature is assumed , it requires optically thin emission and a dust opacity choice at the wavelength of interest .",
    "while the sed - fitted map also requires a dust model assumption , it contains information from multiple wavelengths and simultaneously derives @xmath140 and temperature for each pixel , under the assumption that the mass is well - represented by a modified black body and assuming a fixed spectral index @xmath141 .",
    "therefore the derived column densities can be considered more robust compared to the two previous methods .",
    "however , the sed - fitted map also has the lowest resolution of the three methods considered here , with final convolved beam size of 25@xmath24 , equivalent to @xmath142pc at the distance of 48 .",
    "here we discuss the integrated masses for these three independent methods .",
    "the total mass of 48 can be calculated within a contour of interest using the column densities mask ( shown in figure [ fig : nh2_tmap ] ) : @xmath143 where @xmath144 is the pixel area , @xmath145 and @xmath146 the column density per pixel .",
    "the masking contours for the irac @xmath147 m extinction map were chosen by visual inspection .",
    "this contour results in a threshold of @xmath148 , which correspond to a column density of @xmath149 . a total mass of @xmath150m@xmath86 is enclosed in these contours ( see figure [ fig : nh2_tmap ] , top left panel ) .",
    "we assume a temperature of 17.3k ( the median point source temperature , see section [ sec : pointsrc ] ) for the atlasgal derived column density map ( figure [ fig : nh2_tmap ] ; top right panel ) .",
    "the column density threshold is adopted to be at 3@xmath151the rms noise level ( @xmath152mjy / beam ) , corresponding to @xmath153 .",
    "the resulting total mass inside this column density contour is @xmath154 . for comparison , the median _ herschel _ derived temperature ( figure [ fig : nh2_tmap];bottom right panel ) in this same region is 19.2k .",
    "if we adopt this temperature instead of 17.3k , as assumed above , the column density threshold becomes @xmath155 and the total enclosed atlasgal mass is @xmath156 .    for reference ,",
    "applying a column density threshold of @xmath157 ( derived from the from irac 8@xmath19 m column density map ) is equivalent to applying a 18k isotherm to the _ herschel _ derived column density map , and results in thresholds that encompass approximately the same spatial extent of the three scuba peaks from @xcite .",
    "the mass enclosed within these thresholds differ by only @xmath158 compared to the total mass ( 320 m ) of these three peaks .",
    "the total mass for 48 derived from the 8@xmath19 m extinction ( @xmath159 ) and the 870@xmath19 m ( @xmath160 ) emission are remarkably similar .",
    "furthermore , the average column density threshold for both maps corresponds to a _",
    "herschel _ derived total mass of @xmath161 , also in excellent agreement with the other estimates . considering the uncertainties in the various assumptions , such as the dust properties , uncertainties in background flux levels , and variations in beam sizes we find that our mass agreement for 48 is strikingly good across different methods and compared to previous work .",
    "in general the column density for the diffuse emissions in 48 are comparable for all three methods . for ep , p1 , p2 , p3 and p4 the peak column densities agree within 18% for the atlasgal and the _ herschel _ maps .",
    "however , the peak column densities derived from the 8@xmath19 m extinction are significantly higher then the fitted _ herschel _ maps .",
    "the peak columns can be higher up to @xmath162 .",
    "this might be an effect introduced by the higher spatial resolution of irac .",
