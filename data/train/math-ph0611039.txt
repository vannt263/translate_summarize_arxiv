    "we consider the klein - gordon equation in a ( 1+@xmath0)-dimensional euclidean + schwarzschild - tangherlini background .",
    "we separate variables and analyze a resulting radial equation and derive recurrence relations for the coefficients of a taylor expansion .",
    "a more general schwarzschild - tangherlini black hole in 1+@xmath0 space - time dimensions has metric    -@xmath1+@xmath2+@xmath3 ,    where @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are constants .",
    "they are not related to each other .",
    "@xmath4 must be a zero of the metric coefficient in front of the @xmath7 ( otherwise it would not make sense to the speak of a  horizon \" ) .",
    "the cosmological constant is not necessarily zero , and we replace the hypersphere by an einstein variety ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) of dimension @xmath0 - 1 .",
    "we apply analytic continuation to create a euclidean ( positive definite ) signature analogue of the lorentzian vacuum solution to einstein s equation @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "it is fortunate that there seem to be relatively recent references related to the problem under consideration @xcite @xcite @xcite . ] : @xmath10 the metric becomes @xmath11 the radial variable is now restricted to the range @xmath12 , and regularity at @xmath13=@xmath4 requires that @xmath14 be periodic with period 4@xmath15 ( this is the general euclidean black hole background ) .",
    "thus , the space - time asymptotically has one direction compacted on a circle .",
    "the obvious symmetry is @xmath16 .",
    "the schwarzschild - tangherlini solution is invariant under the large symmetry group : @xmath17(1)@xmath18(@xmath0 ) .",
    "the maximum curvature is of order 1/@xmath19 , which can be made arbitrarily small by taking @xmath4 large .",
    "there are no singularities and the space - time is geodesically complete .",
    "this solution describes a contracting and then expanding  bubble of nothing \" in the following sense .",
    "consider the geometry on the @xmath20=@xmath21/2 surface in the schwarzschild metric , where the parameter @xmath20 is introduced as an angular variable .",
    "this resembles the plane * r*@xmath22 with a circle of radius @xmath4 removed . over each point",
    "is a circle whose radius smoothly goes to zero at @xmath13=@xmath4 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "thus @xmath13=@xmath4 is not a boundary of the space , but it is the circle @xmath23 of minimal length .",
    "figure 1 : a schematic depiction of the geometry at a fixed time , with the circle replaced by two points , and the @xmath13 and @xmath24 directions manifest .",
    "the reader must be aware that quite a lot work was done in this area in 1980 , beyond the references that we list .",
    "in particular , see @xcite and other work referred to therein , which covers all the work of this period on perturbations of the positive - definite schwarzschild geometry .",
    "we study a differential equation that derives from the equation of eigen - values of the laplace operator in the metric ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "we consider two cases , ( i ) the cosmological constant is not zero , and ( ii ) the cosmological constant is zero , and the set of eigen - values is discrete .",
    "infinity is a singular point of this differential equation . in these cases",
    "only , it is regular .",
    "series of powers solve the differential equation .",
    "the problem studied in this paper is somewhat puzzling .",
    "normally in studying the eigenvalues of the laplacian on a non - compact manifold , the domain of definition is a crucial point .",
    "one can work in the hilbert space @xmath25 ; since the manifold is complete , the operator is essentially self - adjoint and the @xmath25 spectrum is well defined .",
    "however , in general , the @xmath25 spectrum is continuous and the question of eigenfunctions a difficult one .",
    "one can also impose boundary conditions by taking finite limits and then studying the behavior as the boundaries tend to infinity .    the current work ,",
    "however , takes neither of these approaches .",
    "we simply postulate a power series expansion , use spherical harmonics , and obtain some results on the power series coefficients .",
    "the main theorem is theorem [ teorema ] ; one assumes that all the laurent series coefficients are not necessarily non - zero for index @xmath26 0 .",
    "one then has a recursive relation for the coefficients .",
    "the powers of the variable are multiples of a natural number .",
    "therefore , the recursive relation separates into    * a recursive relation in terms of the eigen - value and the cosmological constant , * a recursive relation in terms of the eigen - value on the einstein variety and its scalar of curvature , and * a mixed term that is zero .",
    "furthermore , it is clear why one would care about having a recursive relation .",
    "one must not assume that all the coefficients are non - zero for large @xmath27 .",
    "we have a power series in @xmath28 , if the cosmological constant is not zero , and a power series in @xmath29 , if the cosmological constant is zero .",
    "there is real motivation for the paper .",
    "for example , one should only be interested in solving the eigenvalue equation using a separation of variables rather than the more customary methods because if the cosmological constant is zero , then infinity is a singular point of this differential equation that is regular only on a discrete set of eigen - values .",
    "having results on the eigen - values is important because we can calculate the determinant of the laplace operator or , in general , we can calculate a partition function in terms of the laplace operator using these quantized eigen - values .",
    "in this section we investigate and state our results on stability of the metric ( [ 1 ] ) under perturbations of the metric at the classical level .",
    "these satisfy the scalar wave equation .",
    "we are required to check whether there are normalizable effectively tachyon modes ( namely , modes which grow in time relative to the background metric ) among the solutions to the linearized field equations . such modes would be localized near the bubble since the asymptotic region has no such excitations .",
    "we begin by considering a scalar field @xmath30 . in this background , it is in the kernel of the following operator :    -@xmath31-@xmath32-@xmath33-@xmath34+@xmath35-@xmath36 ,    where @xmath36 is the bare mass .",
    "we denote by @xmath37 the laplace operator in the metric @xmath9 .",
    "let us separate variables and consider modes with definite angular momentum @xmath38 , @xmath39=@xmath40 , and definite momentum @xmath41 around the @xmath14 direction , @xmath42=-@xmath43 .",
    "@xmath44    for now let us just consider modes with @xmath45=0 and particles with non zero definite angular momentum , @xmath46 0 .",
    "consider a natural number @xmath47 .",
    "the solutions for the schwarzschild metric are as follows .",
    "write @xmath48 we have polynomial solutions @xmath49 this generalizes the metric perturbations of the schwarzschild black hole studied explicitly in @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite , at least for @xmath45=0 ( higher @xmath45 modes might be expected to be less tachyon in any case ) .",
    "one can translate the modes studied in @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite , expressed in terms of tensor spherical harmonics in the black hole background , to modes in the euclidean schwarzschild geometry . in the former case , the spherical harmonics are eigenfunctions of the laplacian on the spherical directions of the black hole with eigenvalue @xmath47(@xmath47 + 1 ) ; in our analytic continuation these become tensor spherical harmonics on slices of ( [ 1 ] ) with @xmath38=@xmath47(@xmath47 + 1 ) .",
    "the time direction in the black hole becomes our @xmath14 direction , and imaginary frequency for the black hole modes ( corresponding to tachyons in that geometry ) would correspond to real momentum @xmath41 along our @xmath14 circle , which for us is quantized .",
    "the analysis of @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite rules out tachyons in the black hole background by showing that there are no normalizable and nonsingular solutions to the radial part of the equations of motion , and this directly rules out tachyon modes in the bubble of @xmath38=@xmath47(@xmath47 + 1 ) .",
    "furthermore , we find that by replacing @xmath47(@xmath47 + 1 ) by @xmath38 in their analysis , and rescaling fields appropriately , one can extend their arguments to arbitrary @xmath38 , at least for @xmath45=0 .",
    "thus , at least in four dimensions , ( [ 1 ] ) appears to be a classically stable solution to the equations of motion .",
    "we study the differential equation ( [ 3 ] ) in the radial variable that derives from the equation of eigen - values of the laplace operator .",
    "we consider two cases , ( i ) the cosmological constant is not zero , and ( ii ) the cosmological constant is zero , the dimensions are high , and the set of eigen - values is discrete .",
    "consider the function @xmath50 on ( 0 , 1 ) defined as the function @xmath51 evaluated in the product of the radius @xmath4 and the inverse @xmath52 of the variable , @xmath53 then , it solves a differential equation , @xmath54          * the space dimension @xmath0 is greater than three , * the scalar of curvature @xmath6 of the cartesian product is zero , and * the eigen - value @xmath36 of the laplace operator on the cartesian product is the quotient of ( i ) the eigen - value @xmath45 on the circle , and ( ii ) the sectional curvature @xmath56 of the variety , @xmath57        in functional integrals , the regularized determinant of the laplacian @xmath58 can be defined in terms of the @xmath59-function of @xmath58 by the formula ln det @xmath58=-@xmath59(0 ) .",
    "this definition can be used whenever the @xmath59-function @xmath59(@xmath60)=@xmath61 can be analytically continued to the point @xmath60=0 .",
    "we assume specific values for the eigenvalues @xmath62 .",
    "the correct values for the @xmath62 s are given by @xmath63 therefore , @xmath64 differentiating ( [ 2 ] ) with respect to @xmath60 and setting @xmath60=0 , we get @xmath65 therefore , @xmath66 if the sectional curvature of the variety is one , then , @xmath67      infinity is a singular point of the differential equation in the radial variable , it is regular only in the cases [ caso 1 ] or [ caso 2 ] .",
    "we solve the characteristic equation of the differential equation .                      * a recursive relation in terms of the eigen - value @xmath36 and the scalar of curvature @xmath6 , * a recursive relation in terms of the eigen - value @xmath38 and the scalar of curvature @xmath5 , and * a mixed term ( [ 5 ] ) that is zero .",
    "[ teorema ] consider a sequence of numbers @xmath78 , @xmath79 ... , that fulfill a recursive relation in terms of the characteristic exponent , the eigen - values , the scalars of curvature and the space dimension , @xmath80 @xmath81-@xmath82+@xmath83-@xmath84 ,      according to the case .",
    "then , the product of ( i ) the variable raised to the characteristic exponent @xmath89 , and ( ii ) a series of powers multiple of a number that depends on the space dimension , @xmath90 solves the differential equation ( [ 4 ] ) , where @xmath91 according to the case .",
    "if it is assumed that ( i ) the eigen - values @xmath36 , @xmath45 and the scalar of curvature @xmath6 vanish , and ( ii ) the variety is the hypersphere , @xmath94 then two series of powers @xmath95 and @xmath96 solve the differential equation ( [ 4 ] ) .",
    "moreover , in the space - time of four dimensions , @xmath97                          set @xmath102\\sp{-1}\\\\ \\frac{(n-2)(n-1)}{r_h}\\left[\\frac\\mu{(e+i)\\sp2}-\\frac{r_h}{(n-2)(n-1)}\\left(1+\\frac{n-2}{e+i}\\right)\\left(1 + 2\\frac{n-2}{e+i}\\right)\\right]\\sp{-1 } \\end{array}\\right.,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] according to the case .",
    "then , @xmath103 for a pair of natural numbers @xmath27 and @xmath104 , we define the set @xmath105 of functions @xmath50 : @xmath1061 , ... , @xmath1071 , ... ,",
