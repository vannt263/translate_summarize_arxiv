    "anderson localization@xcite as well as strong correlation effects due to interactions@xcite have been studied intensely for decades in solid state physics .",
    "it is well established that both phenomena modify the transport properties of solids in a crucial way .",
    "in particular , disorder as well as correlations are capable of inducing metal - insulator transitions known as the anderson transition and the mott - hubbard transition , respectively .",
    "although each fundamental phenomenon - correlations and disorder - on its own gives rise to challenges to both experimental and theoretical research and is still a subject of current investigations , the realistic modeling of materials requires the simultaneous consideration of both effects .",
    "this interplay is of central interest within present day s solid state physics.@xcite    theoretical investigations , e.g. of the anderson - hubbard model combining the hubbard model and the anderson model are notoriously difficult .",
    "the most intriguing effects , such as the mott transition and the anderson transition , take place at intermediate interaction and disorder strength requiring a non - perturbative approach .",
    "extensions of the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft)@xcite to disordered systems are especially promising in this respect , since local correlations are incorporated non - perturbatively .",
    "such extensions were performed on a level of the coherent potential approximation@xcite and on a level of typical medium theory ( tmt ) incorporating localization effects.@xcite a shortcoming of both approaches is given by the non - consideration of disorder - induced fluctuations of local observables .",
    "dobrosavljevi and kotliar extended the dmft to include disorder fluctuations in space on a fully stochastic level,@xcite which is referred to as statistical dmft .",
    "@xcite this theory is capable of describing mott and anderson - mott transitions non - perturbatively and allows for the self - consistent determination of the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of local observables .    among the investigations of the box disordered anderson - hubbard model in @xmath0 dimensions which are non - perturbative and incorporate localization effects",
    "the tmt was used in the most comprehensive way.@xcite within these works the ground state phase diagram has been determined for a half - filled band @xcite and the physical two fluid picture of the anderson - mott transition has been developed.@xcite the statistical dmft has also been used to study the box disordered anderson - hubbard model.@xcite the anderson - mott transition has been characterized in detail by an accurate treatment of the low energy excitations.@xcite remarkably , two critical disorder strengths have been found , one corresponding to the entering of a non - fermi liquid phase and a second one corresponding to the anderson - mott transition .",
    "a special focus was laid on the zero - bias anomaly @xcite in two dimensions.@xcite however , partially due to the immense numerical effort and partially due to the restrictions of the used impurity solvers  the slave - boson approach@xcite and the hubbard - i approximation@xcite  the ground state phase diagram was not determined .    in this work",
    "we revisit the anderson - hubbard model with box disorder by means of the statistical dmft . by using the modified perturbation theory ( mpt)@xcite as an impurity solver we determine the pdf of the local density of states ( ldos ) for finite interaction strengths which was not done before .",
    "our mpt investigation shows that the pdf of the ldos is not well fitted by a log - normal distribution function within the metallic phase in contrast to the non - interacting case.@xcite finally , the paramagnetic ground state phase diagram consisting of disordered correlated metal , mott insulator , and anderson - mott insulator is determined and critically discussed with regard to established results obtained by means of tmt earlier.@xcite",

    "<S> strongly correlated electrons with box disorder in high - dimensional lattices are investigated . </S>",
    "<S> we apply the statistical dynamical mean - field theory , which treats local correlations non - perturbatively . </S>",
    "<S> the incorporation of a finite lattice connectivity allows for the detection of disorder - induced localization via the probability distribution function of the local density of states . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a complete paramagnetic ground state phase diagram and find correlation - induced as well as disorder - induced metal - insulator transitions . </S>",
    "<S> our results qualitatively confirm predictions obtained by typical medium theory . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we find that the probability distribution function of the local density of states in the metallic phase strongly deviates from a log - normal distribution as found for the non - interacting case . </S>"
