    "since cobe @xcite discovered and mapped the anisotropies in the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation @xcite , many balloon and satellite experiments have refined the measurements of such anisotropies , reaching up to now an amazing combined precision .",
    "the cobe sequel has continued with the wmap satellite @xcite which has been able to measure the temperature angular power spectrum up to the third peak with unprecedent precision @xcite , and increase the level of sensitivity to primordial non - gaussianity in the bispectrum by two orders of magnitude compared to cobe @xcite . the next - to - wmap satellite , planck @xcite",
    ", whose launch is programmed for october 2008 , is expected to precisely measure the temperature angular power spectrum up to the eighth peak @xcite , and improve the level of sensitivity to primordial non - gaussianity in the bispectrum by one order of magnitude compared to wmap @xcite .    because of the progressive improvement in the accuracy of the satellite measurements described above , it is pertinent to study cosmological inflationary models that generate significant ( and observable ) levels of non - gaussianity . an interesting way to address the problem involves the @xmath4 formalism @xcite , which can be employed to give the levels of non - gaussianity @xmath0 @xcite and @xmath5 @xcite in the bispectrum @xmath1 and trispectrum @xmath6 of the primordial curvature perturbation @xmath2 respectively .",
    "such non - gaussianity levels are given , for slow - roll inflationary models , in terms of the local evolution of the universe under consideration , as well as of the @xmath7-point correlators , evaluated a few hubble times after horizon exit , of the perturbations @xmath8 in the scalar fields that determine the dynamics of such a universe during inflation .",
    "in the @xmath4 formalism for slow - roll inflationary models , the primordial curvature perturbation @xmath9 is written as a taylor series in the scalar field perturbations @xmath10 , evaluated a few hubble times after horizon exit , @xmath11 where the brackets mean spatial averages , @xmath12 is the amount of inflation ( or number of e - folds ) from a bit later ( in hubble times ) than the time when the cosmologically relevant scales exit the horizon and until the time at which one wishes to calculate @xmath2 , and @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and so on .",
    "it is in this way that the correlation functions of @xmath2 ( for instance , @xmath15 ) can be obtained in terms of series , as often happens in quantum field theory where the probability amplitude is a series whose possible truncation at any desired order is determined by the coupling constants of the theory .",
    "a highly relevant question is that of whether the series for @xmath16 converges in cosmological perturbation theory and whether it is possible in addition to find some quantities that determine the possible truncation of the series , which in this sense would be analogous to the coupling constants in quantum field theory . in general such quantities",
    "will depend on the specific inflationary model ; the series then can not be simply truncated at some order until one is sure that it does indeed converge , and besides , one has to be careful not to forget any term that may be leading in the series even if it is of higher order in the coupling constant .",
    "this issue has not been investigated in the present literature , and generally the series has been truncated to second- or third - order neglecting in addition terms that could be the leading ones @xcite .",
    "the most studied and popular inflationary models nowadays are those of the slow - roll variety with canonical kinetic terms @xcite , because of their simplicity and because they easily satisfy the spectral index requirements for the generation of large - scale structures .",
    "one of the usual predictions from inflation and the theory of cosmological perturbations is that the levels of non - gaussianity in the primordial perturbations are expected to be unobservably small when considering this class of models @xcite are generated for a reduced window parameter associated with the initial field values when taking into account only the tree - level terms in both @xmath3 and @xmath1 .",
    "however , such a result seems to be incompatible with the general expectation , proved in ref .",
    "@xcite , of @xmath0 being of order the slow - roll parameters , and _ in consequence unobservable _ , for two - field slow - roll models with separable potential when considering only the tree - level terms both in @xmath3 and @xmath1 .",
    "the origin of the discrepancy could be understood by conjecturing that the trajectory in field space , for the models in refs .",
    "@xcite , seems to be sharply curved , being quite near a saddle point ; such a condition is required , according to ref .",
    "@xcite , to generate @xmath17 .",
    "[ laila ] ] .",
    "this fact leads us to analyze the cosmological perturbations in the framework of first - order cosmological perturbation theory .",
    "non - gaussian characteristics are then suppressed since the non - linearities in the inflaton potential and in the metric perturbations are not taken into account .",
    "the non - gaussian characteristics are actually present and they are made explicit if second - order @xcite or higher - order corrections are considered .",
    "the whole literature that encompasses the slow - roll inflationary models with canonical kinetic terms reports that the non - gaussianity level @xmath0 is expected to be very small , being of the order of the slow - roll parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 , ( @xmath20 ) @xcite .",
    "these works have not taken into account either the convergence of the series for @xmath2 nor the possibility that loop corrections dominate over the tree level ones in the @xmath7-point correlators .",
    "our main result in this paper is the recognition of the possible convergence of the @xmath2 series , and the existence of some `` coupling constants '' that determine the possible truncation of the @xmath2 series at any desired order .",
    "when this situation is encountered in a subclass of small - field _ slow - roll _ inflationary models with canonical kinetic terms , the one - loop corrections may dominate the series when calculating either the spectrum @xmath3 , or the bispectrum @xmath1 .",
    "this in turn _ may generate sizeable and observable levels of non - gaussianity _ in total contrast with the general claims found in the present literature .",
    "the layout of the paper is the following : in section [ descriptors ] we consider the quantities that describe the statistical properties encoded in any probability distribution function ; theoretical explanations as well as observational constraints for @xmath2 are given .",
    "section [ dnf ] is devoted to the issue of the @xmath2 series convergence and loop corrections in the framework of the @xmath16 formalism , as well as to the presentation of the current knowledge about primordial non - gaussianity in slow - roll inflationary models .",
    "a particular subclass of small - field slow - roll inflationary models is the subject of section [ model ] as it is this subclass of models that generate significant levels of non - gaussianity .",
    "the available parameter space for this subclass of models is constrained in section [ rest ] by taking into account some observational requirements such as the cobe normalisation , the scalar spectral tilt , and the minimal amount of inflation .",
    "another requirement of methodological nature , the possible tree - level or one - loop dominance in @xmath3 and/or @xmath1 , is considered in this section .",
    "the level of non - gaussianity @xmath0 in the bispectrum @xmath1 is calculated in section [ endcal ] for models where @xmath2 is generated during inflation ; a comparison with the current literature is made .",
    "section [ seccou ] is devoted to central issues in the consistency of the approach followed such as satisfying necessary conditions for the convergence of the @xmath2 series and working in a perturbative regime .",
    "finally in section [ concl ] we conclude .",
    "the professional reader who is already familiarized with the present ideas on the cosmological non - gaussianity may skip sections [ descriptors ] and [ dnf ] , leaping directly to the new material starting from section [ model ] .",
    "as regards the level of non - gaussianity @xmath5 in the trispectrum @xmath6 , it will be studied following the sequence of ideas presented above in a companion paper @xcite .",
    "the primordial curvature perturbation @xmath2 , as well as the contrast in the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation @xmath21 and the gravitational potential @xmath22 , are examples of cosmological functions of space and time being described by probability distribution functions . in particular , the probability distribution function @xmath23 for @xmath2 has well defined statistical descriptors which depend directly upon the particular inflationary model and that are suitable for comparison with present observational data .",
    "such a comparison allows us either to reject or to keep particular inflationary models as those which better represent nature s behaviour . in this section",
    "we present a cosmologically motivated description of the statistical descriptors for probability distribution functions , focusing mainly on @xmath23 .",
    "a probability distribution function @xmath23 for any function of space and time @xmath24 may be understood as the univocal correspondence between the possible values that @xmath2 may take throughout the space and the normalised frecuency of appearences of such values for a given time .",
    "any continous function of @xmath2 might represent a probability distribution function as long as @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "however , for a particular probability distribution function , how many independent parameters do we need to completely characterize it in a unique way ? and despite the possible infinite number of parameters required to do this , what is the information encoded in those parameters ?",
    "the answers to these questions rely on the moments @xmath27 of the distribution . for a given probability distribution function @xmath23 ,",
    "there are an infinite number of moments that work as statistical descriptors of @xmath24 : @xmath28    what can we say about @xmath24 from the knowledge of the moments of the distribution ?",
    "if , for instance , all the odd moments with @xmath29 ( skewness , ... etc ) are zero , we can say that the probability distribution function @xmath23 is even around the mean value .",
    "if in addition all the even moments with @xmath30 ( kurtosis , ... etc ) are expressed only as products of the variance , we can say that the distribution function is gaussian .",
    "indeed , as is well known , the only quantities required to reproduce a gaussian function are the mean value and the variance : @xmath31 departures from the exact gaussianity come either from non - vanishing odd moments with @xmath29 , in which case the probability distribution function is non - symmetric around the mean value , or from higher even moments different to products of the variance , in which case the probability distribution function continues to be symmetric around the mean value although it is non - gaussian , or from both of them .",
    "a non - gaussian probability distribution function requires then more moments , other than the mean value and the variance , to be completely reconstructed .",
    "such a reconstruction process is described for instance in ref .",
    "@xcite .    working in momentum space is especially useful in cosmology because the modes associated with the quantum fluctuations of scalar fields during inflation become classical once they leave the horizon @xcite .",
    "the same applies for the primordial curvature perturbation @xmath2 which , in addition , is a conserved quantity while staying outside the horizon if the adiabatic condition is satisfied @xcite . as regards the moments of the probability distribution function , they have a direct connection with the correlation functions for the fourier modes @xmath32 defined in flat space . as the @xmath7-point correlators of @xmath33",
    "are generically defined in terms of spectral functions of the wavevectors involved and bispectrum @xmath1 are functions of the wavenumbers only . for the trispectrum @xmath6 and the other higher order spectral functions , the momentum dependence also involves the direction of the wavevectors . ] : @xmath34 the moments of the distribution are then written as momentum integrals of the spectral functions for the modes @xmath33 : @xmath35 non - gaussianity in @xmath2 is , therefore , associated with non - vanishing higher order spectral functions , starting from the bispectrum @xmath1 .",
    "theoretical cosmologists work with @xmath2 .",
    "however , astronomers work with observable quantities such as the contrast in the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation @xmath21 . the connection between the theoretical cosmologist quantity @xmath2 and the astronomer quantity @xmath21 is given by the sachs - wolfe effect @xcite which , at first - order and for superhorizon scales , looks as follows : @xmath36 thus , although it is essential to study the sachs - wolfe relation at higher orders , which is far more complicated than eq .",
    "( [ swe ] ) , theoretical cosmologists may study the statistical properties of the observed @xmath37 through the spectral functions associated with the curvature perturbation @xmath2 : @xmath38    to end this section , we will parametrize the spectral functions of @xmath2 in terms of quantities which are the ones for which observational bounds are given .",
    "because of the direct connection between these quantities and the moments of the probability distribution function @xmath23 , we may also call these quantities as the statistical descriptors for @xmath23 .",
    "the spectrum @xmath3 is parametrized in terms of an amplitude @xmath39 and a spectral index @xmath40 which measures the deviation from an exactly scale - invariant spectrum @xcite : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the global expansion parameter and @xmath43 is the hubble parameter , with the dot meaning a derivative with respect to cosmic time .",
    "the bispectrum @xmath1 and trispectrum @xmath6 are parametrized in terms of products of the spectrum @xmath3 , and the quantities @xmath0 and @xmath5 respectively defined here and that defined in ref .",
    "the origin of the sign difference lies in the way the observed @xmath0 is defined @xcite , through the bardeen s curvature perturbation : @xmath44 with @xmath45 , and the way @xmath0 is defined in ref .",
    "@xcite , through the gauge invariant newtonian potential : @xmath46 with @xmath47 @xcite . ]",

    "given the present observational state - of - the - art , @xmath40 , @xmath0 , and @xmath5 are the statistical descriptors that discriminate among models for the origin of the large - scale structure once @xmath39 has been fixed to the observed value . since non - vanishing higher order spectral functions such as @xmath1 and @xmath6 imply non - gaussianity in the primordial curvature perturbation @xmath2 , the statistical descriptors @xmath0 and",
    "@xmath5 are usually called the levels of non - gaussianity .",
    "cobe provided us with a reliable value for the spectral amplitude @xmath39 @xcite : @xmath49 which is usually called the cobe normalisation .",
    "as regards the spectral index , the latest data release and analysis from the wmap satellite shows that @xmath50 @xcite which rejects exact scale invariance at more than @xmath51 . such a result has been extensively used to constrain inflation model building @xcite , and although several classes of inflationary models have been ruled out through the spectral index , lots of models are still allowed",
    "; that is why it is so important an appropiate knowledge of the statistical descriptors @xmath0 and @xmath5 .",
    "present observations show that the primordial curvature perturbation @xmath2 is almost , but not completely , gaussian .",
    "the level of non - gaussianity @xmath0 in the bispectrum @xmath1 , after five years of data from nasa s wmap satellite , is in the range @xmath52 at @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "there is at present no observational bound on the level of non - gaussianity @xmath5 in the trispectrum @xmath6 although it was predicted that cobe should either detect it or impose the lower bound @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "it is expected that future wmap data releases will either detect non - gaussianity or reduce the bounds on @xmath0 and @xmath5 at the @xmath51 level to @xmath54 @xcite and @xmath55 @xcite respectively .",
    "the esa s planck satellite @xcite , which will be launched in october 2008 , promises to reduce the bounds to @xmath56 @xcite and @xmath57 @xcite at the @xmath51 level if non - gaussianity is not detected .",
    "in addition , by studying the 21-cm emission spectral line in the cosmic neutral hydrogen prior to the era of reionization , it is also possible to know about the levels of non - gaussianity @xmath0 and @xmath5 ; the 21-cm background anisotropies capture information about the primordial non - gaussianity better than any high resolution map of cosmic microwave background radiation : an experiment like this could reduce the bounds on the non - gaussianity levels to @xmath58 @xcite and @xmath59 @xcite at the @xmath51 confidence .",
    "finally , it is worth stating that there have been recent claims about the detection of non - gaussianity in the bispectrum @xmath1 of @xmath2 from the wmap 3-year data @xcite .",
    "such claims , which report a rejection of @xmath60 at more that @xmath51 ( @xmath61 ) , are based on the estimation of the bispectrum while using some specific foreground masks .",
    "the wmap 5-year analysis @xcite shows a similar behaviour when using those masks , but reduces the significance of the results when other more conservative masks are included allowing again the possibility of exact gaussianity .",
    "the @xmath16 formalism @xcite provides a powerful method for calculating @xmath2 and all its statistical descriptors at any desired order in cosmological perturbation theory from knowing , in the case of slow - roll inflationary models , only the evolution of a family of unperturbed universes and the correlation functions a bit later than horizon exit of the perturbations in the field scalars present during inflation @xcite .",
    "this section is devoted to a brief review of the formalism and to a short discussion of some relevant issues which either have not been properly taken into account or have not been discussed at all in the current literature .      in the cosmological standard model",
    "@xcite the observable universe is homogeneous and isotropic , being described by the unperturbed friedmann - robertson - walker metric whose line element , for a spatially flat universe , looks as follows : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the global expansion parameter , @xmath64 is the cosmic time , and @xmath65 represents the position in cartesian spatial coordinates .",
    "the homogeneity and isotropy conditions describe very well the universe at large scales , but departures from the unperturbed background are observationally evident at smaller scales .",
    "one way to parametrize the departures from the homogeneous and isotropic background is to include perturbations in the metric , for which we have to define a slicing and a threading .",
    "the slicing will be defined so that the energy density in fixed-@xmath64 slices of spacetime is uniform .",
    "the threading will correspond to comoving fixed-@xmath66 world lines .",
    "thus , the perturbed spatial metric may be defined as @xmath67 where @xmath68 , which gives origin to the tensor perturbations , has unit determinant .",
