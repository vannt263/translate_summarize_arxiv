    "this role is shared with tio and vo bands , which dominate this spectral region in late m - dwarfs .",
    "as we move to later spectral types we need to incorporate progressively higher depletions of these oxides and of the hydrides crh and cah , consistently with the expectation that ti and v atoms are depleted into grains ; and we also require additional opacity to reproduce the overall shape of the spectra .",
