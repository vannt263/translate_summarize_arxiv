    "associated to every knot @xmath0 is its classical alexander polynomial @xmath1 .",
    "this well - known polynomial invariant encodes metabelian information of the knot group .",
    "that is , one can think of the alexander polynomial as describing the representations of the knot group into a metabelian subgroup of a linear group .",
    "knot groups , however , allow for many other types of non - abelian linear representations . from this perspective",
    ", the alexander polynomial is just a special case of a more general invariant called the twisted alexander polynomial introduced by xiao - song lin @xcite .",
    "the twisted alexander polynomial @xmath2 depends not only on the knot @xmath0 but also on a choice of some linear representation @xmath3 and it has been studied extensively in recent years .    in this article , we study twisted alexander polynomials of 2-bridge knots associated with a linear representation coming from a fox coloring of the knot . if @xmath4 is a 2-bridge knot and @xmath5 is an odd prime dividing the determinant @xmath6 of @xmath4 , then it is well - known that there is a fox @xmath5-coloring of the knot .",
    "this coloring provides a linear representation of the knot group that factors through the dihedral group .",
    "we call the twisted alexander polynomial associated with this linear representation the _ @xmath5-twisted _ alexander polynomial of @xmath4 and denote it by @xmath7",
    ". our study of these polynomials was motivated by the following conjecture of hirasawa and murasugi @xcite .",
    "[ conjecture][hm conjecture ] let @xmath0 be a knot and @xmath8 a non - abelian linear representation , where @xmath9 is the dihedral group of order @xmath10 with @xmath5 an odd prime .",
    "then @xmath11 for some integer laurent polynomial @xmath12 and furthermore @xmath13    hirasawa and murasugi verify this conjecture for 2-bridge knots whose fundamental groups map onto certain free products but do so without finding a specific formula for the twisted alexander polynomial .",
    "we will extend their work but employ a different method in this paper .",
    "in particular , we will derive a specific formula for the twisted alexander polynomial of the knots we study and then use it to verify the conjecture directly .",
    "before we proceed , however , it is important to note that there is some potential ambiguity in the statement of the conjecture .",
    "first of all , neither the alexander nor the twisted alexander polynomial is well - defined .",
    "the former is only well - defined up to multiples of @xmath14 while the latter up to multiples of @xmath15 .",
    "thus , the laurent polynomial @xmath12 in the conjecture also fails to be well - defined . because of this there are two different interpretations of the conjecture .",
    "a weak form of the conjecture would allow for some choices of @xmath16 , @xmath1 , and @xmath12 that give equality in the first part and possibly different choices of @xmath1 and @xmath12 that give congruency in the second part . a stronger form of the conjecture would require the same choices in both parts .",
    "for the families of knots studied in this paper , we will prove the stronger version of the conjecture .",
    "motivated by a beautiful formula for @xmath17 , we develop a computational method and accompanying formula for @xmath7 . combining this formula with a recursive technique , we derive specific formulae for several bi - infinite families of 2-bridge knots .",
    "in particular , given a specific choice of @xmath18 , @xmath6 , and @xmath5 , we derive a formula for the @xmath5-twisted alexander polynomial of the 2-bridge knot associated to the fraction @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are any non - negative integers and @xmath22 with @xmath23 . for any 2-bridge knot ,",
    "the alexander polynomial is always a factor of its twisted alexander polynomial and , for these bi - infinite families , the formula for @xmath24 depends on @xmath25 , and @xmath20 but not on @xmath21 . with this formula in hand",
    ", we can verify conjecture  [ conjecture ] for every knot in the family . from a practical point of view",
    ", one can compute the @xmath5-twisted alexander polynomial for as many bi - infinite families of this kind as one likes . furthermore",
    ", if we fix @xmath18 and @xmath5 , then only a finite number of computations are needed to derive a formula for @xmath7 for all possible @xmath6 .",
    "we do this for a small sample of @xmath26 , namely : @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 .",
    "the paper will proceed as follows . in section  2 , we define the @xmath5-twisted alexander polynomial and find a formula for it which is derived from a simple graph associated to @xmath31 which we call the epsilon graph . in section  3 ,",
    "we establish several properties of this graph which are used in section  4 to determine how @xmath7 changes when @xmath18 and @xmath6 are changed in certain ways . finally ,",
    "in section  5 , we apply these results to establish conjecture  [ hm conjecture ] for several infinite families of 2-bridge knots .",
    "consider the 2-bridge knot @xmath4 determined by the integers @xmath18 and @xmath6 where @xmath32 , both @xmath18 and @xmath6 are odd , and @xmath33 .",
    "it is well known that the fundamental group is presented as @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 . here",
    "@xmath37 denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to @xmath38 . as an aside",
    ", it is easy to show that the @xmath39 s are symmetric , that is , @xmath40 .",
    "the alexander polynomial can be derived from this presentation using the fox free differential calculus @xcite .",
    "letting @xmath41 be the relator @xmath42 in @xmath43 , a calculation shows that the matrix @xmath44 of fox derivatives is @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47    to find the alexander polynomial , we replace @xmath48 and @xmath49 in @xmath50 with their images in the abelianization of @xmath43 , whose generator we call @xmath51 , to obtain the @xmath52 matrix @xmath53 . in this case",
    "both @xmath48 and @xmath49 have image @xmath51 .",
    "now striking either entry of @xmath53 and taking the determinant of the remaining @xmath54 matrix gives the following formula for the alexander polynomial of an arbitrary 2-bridge knot .",
    "( see @xcite and compare @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath55 for any 2-bridge knot , we can use ( [ alex poly formula ] ) to produce a canonical choice for the alexander polynomial and we shall do so unless otherwise noted throughout the rest of the paper .",
    "formula  ( [ alex poly formula ] ) can also be interpreted graphically in a beautiful way using what we call the _ epsilon _ graph , @xmath56 .",
    "( a similar graph is studied by hirasawa and murasugi in @xcite . )",
    "given @xmath32 , @xmath57 odd , and @xmath33 , the _ epsilon graph _ ,",

    "summing the number of vertices at each horizontal level of @xmath64 gives the alternating coefficients of the alexander polynomial .",
    "that is , @xmath65 .",
    "this method of deriving @xmath17 from @xmath56 follows directly from ( [ alex poly formula ] ) .",
    "the twisted alexander polynomial can also be obtained using the fox differential calculus .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we first choose a linear representation @xmath66 .",
    "the _ twisted alexander matrix _",
    "@xmath67 is obtained by replacing @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath68 in the first column of @xmath50 with @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and the identity matrix @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "that is , @xmath72    the _ twisted alexander polynomial with respect to @xmath73 _ is then defined ( see @xcite ) as @xmath74    furthermore , if @xmath73 is unimodular , this is an invariant of @xmath0 up to multiples of @xmath75 .",
    "we now focus on linear representations obtained from fox colorings . if @xmath5 is an odd prime , then a _ fox coloring _ , or an _ @xmath5-coloring _ , is a homomorphsim @xmath76 from @xmath43 onto the dihedral group @xmath9 of @xmath10 elements .",
    "recall that the dihedral group has a presentation @xmath77 ( note that the presentation used in @xcite uses generators @xmath78 and @xmath79 in place of @xmath38 and @xmath80 , respectively . )",
    "it is well known that the determinant of the 2-bridge knot @xmath4 is @xmath6 and that an @xmath5-coloring exists if and only if @xmath5 divides @xmath6 .",
    "furthermore , if an @xmath5-coloring exists , then , up to conjugation , we may assume that @xmath48 and @xmath49 are sent to @xmath38 and @xmath81 , respectively , for some @xmath82 .",
    "since the twisted alexander polynomial is defined using determinants , this conjugation will not change @xmath2 .",
    "we now choose , and fix , the following faithful , linear representation @xmath83 defined by @xmath84 observe that @xmath85 and @xmath86 are obtained from the identity matrix by reversing the rows and cyclically permuting the rows , respectively .",
    "thus , an @xmath5-coloring @xmath76 determines a linear representation @xmath87 and hence an associated twisted alexander polynomial .    to now determine the twisted alexander matrix @xmath67",
    ", we replace @xmath88 and @xmath89 in ( [ def of ahat ] ) with the matrices @xmath85 and @xmath90 , respectively . using the formula for @xmath91 in ( [ partial of r wrt a ] ) and the fact that both @xmath85 and @xmath90 are their own inverses , we see that @xmath92    the numerator of the twisted alexander polynomial is the determinant of @xmath67 . by examining the form of @xmath90",
    ", it follows that the denominator is @xmath93    our strategy for finding the twisted alexander polynomial is to compute the determinant of a similar matrix @xmath94 which has a particularly nice form .",
    "if @xmath95 ( mod @xmath5 ) and @xmath96 , then we define @xmath97 to be the @xmath98 symmetric matrix given by @xmath99 .",
    "now from ( [ alex matrix ] ) , we see that in order to compute the determinant of @xmath100 we need to determine the matrices @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "if @xmath103 for @xmath104 , then a simple calculation shows that @xmath105 thus , @xmath106 is an eigenvalue of @xmath107 with associated eigenvector @xmath108 .",
    "furthermore , note that the @xmath21-th column of @xmath97 is the eigenvector @xmath109 .",
    "using the definition of @xmath110 , we see that @xmath111 letting @xmath112 denote the @xmath62-th standard basis vector , we then obtain @xmath113 therefore , @xmath114    furthermore , if we set @xmath115 , then we find that @xmath116 .",
    "consider now the product @xmath117 .",

    "hence we will now write @xmath130 and @xmath131 in place of @xmath132 and @xmath133 , respectively , to emphasize the dependance on @xmath18 and @xmath6 .",
    "moreover , since the factors @xmath134 and @xmath135 cancel in the product @xmath136 for each @xmath62 , the determinant of @xmath137 and therefore the twisted alexander polynomial , @xmath138 , does not depend on @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
