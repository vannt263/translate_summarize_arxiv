    "in nature most processes are not in thermodynamic equilibrium . for example , whenever a system is exposed to a flux of matter or energy in the stationary state , then it is generally not possible to describe it with standard methods of equilibrium statistical mechanics . for systems out of equilibrium",
    "the probability distribution of configurations is normally not known and a theory which allows one to calculate macroscopic quantities is not available .",
    "therefore , general results valid for nonequilibrium processes are of great theoretical interest .",
    "this applies in particular to fluctuation relations @xcite , which are fairly general statements valid for any system out of equilibrium .",
    "a large variety of nonequilibrium systems can be modelled as continuous - time markov jump processes , meaning that the system jumps spontaneously from one classical configuration to the other with certain rates .",
    "if these rates obey detailed balance , the system relaxes into a equilibrium state .",
    "however , if detailed balance is broken , the system will relax into a nonequilibrium stationary state where the probability current between microstates is non - zero @xcite .",
    "maintaining these non - vanishing probability currents requires an external drive which continuously produces entropy in the environment .",
    "remarkably , this entropy production can be quantified without knowing the explicit structure of the environment  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the average entropy production is zero if and only if detailed balance is fulfilled , meaning that entropy production can be used as an indicator of nonequilibrium .    since the entropy production depends on the specific sequence of microscopic transitions ( the so - called stochastic path ) , it is a fluctuating quantity with a certain probability distribution  @xcite .",
    "a fluctuation relation is an equation that restricts the functional form of this distribution .",
    "there are two different kinds of fluctuation relations , namely , finite time fluctuation relations and infinite time fluctuation relations ( see @xcite ) .",
    "finite time fluctuation relations describe the distribution of the total entropy ( system + environment ) and hold exactly for any time interval  @xcite",
    ". relations of this kind include the jarzynski equality @xcite and crooks relation @xcite . on the other hand , infinite time fluctuation relations are asymptotically valid for the entropy produced in the environment ( which is also known as action functional ) @xcite . here we will deal with this infinite time relation , and we refer to it as the fluctuation theorem or the gallavotti - cohen - evans - morriss ( gcem ) symmetry .",
    "large deviation theory @xcite is the appropriate mathematical framework to investigate the fluctuation theorem . using these methods",
    "the gcem symmetry can be recast as a symmetry of the large deviation function for the probability distribution of the entropy .",
    "this symmetry does not yet allow us to calculate macroscopic observables , but at present it is the most general result for systems out of equilibrium .    even though the fluctuation theorem is very general",
    ", one might argue that it is also very specific in the sense that it is valid only for one particular functional of the stochastic path , namely , the entropy produced in the environment .",
    "it is therefore interesting to find out if there are other physically relevant functionals with a similar symmetry .",
    "as a first step in this direction , we recently demonstrated that the height of an interface in a certain growth model defines a physically relevant time - integrated current different from the entropy with a symmetric large deviation function   @xcite .",
    "interestingly , this symmetry can only be observed for a particular system size of the model because only then the network of microscopic transitions acquires a particular form .",
    "the objective of the present paper is to generalize the new symmetry found in @xcite .",
    "we prove that for a class of jump processes with a particular network of states we can find time - integrated currents different from entropy displaying a symmetric large deviation function .",
    "this symmetry is similar to the gcem symmetry because it restricts the form of a large deviation function related to a time - integrated current .",
    "however , it is important to note that our symmetry is different from the gcem symmetry because it refers to a different time - integrated current and has a slightly different physical origin .",
    "it is known that the gcem symmetry is a direct consequence of the fact that the entropy is given by the weight of a stochastic path divided by the weight of the time - reversed path . in this sense ,",
    "the origin of the gcem symmetry is related to time - reversal . an interesting question , which we address here for a particular case , would be to explain the origin of the symmetry . we show that it is also associated with time - reversal , but in a more hidden way : it comes to light only when we perform an appropriate grouping of stochastic trajectories .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we define time - integrated currents and briefly review the fluctuation theorem . in sec .",
    "3 we prove the new symmetry relation .",
    "some physical examples where our symmetry appears in physically meaningful time - integrated currents are presented in sec .  4 .",
    "before concluding we discuss the origin of the symmetry for a simple four states system in sec .",

    "more specifically , each transition @xmath17 changes the entropy in the environment by @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , the accumulated entropy production along a stochastic path @xmath30 is a time - integrated current of the form @xmath31 = \\sum_{i=0}^{m-1 } \\ln \\frac{\\rate_{\\conf(t_i)\\to\\conf(t_{i+1})}}{\\rate_{\\conf(t_{i+1})\\to\\conf(t_i)}}\\,.\\ ] ] the fluctuation theorem reads  @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the large deviation function associated with @xmath34 .",

    "the gcem symmetry ( [ gcemforlarge ] ) in terms of the scaled cumulant generating function of the entropy @xmath50 is @xmath51 the advantage of dealing with the scaled cumulant generating function is that it is easier to calculate in several situations . in the present case it corresponds to determine the minimum eigenvalue of the perron - frobenius matrix ( [ modgenerator ] ) .",
    "note that , the curve @xmath50 has a convex shape , vanishes at @xmath52 and @xmath53 , and reaches its minimum at @xmath54 .",
    "is it possible to find other time - integrated currents with a gcem - like symmetry ?",
    "previous works ( see e.g. @xcite ) have shown that such currents do exist .",
    "however , these examples are unsatisfactory in so far as the proposed currents differ from the entropy only initially while they become proportional to the entropy in the long time limit . if we call such a current @xmath55 , this means that @xmath56 .",
    "moreover , since the current @xmath55 becomes proportional to entropy in the long time limit , @xmath57 , i.e. , the rescaled scaled cumulant generating functions of @xmath55 and @xmath58 have the same functional form .",
    "the main objective of the present paper is to show that it is possible to find symmetric currents which differ from the entropy even in the limit @xmath26 so that their rescaled scaled cumulant generating functions differ from @xmath50 , even tough they are both symmetric and touch the horizontal axis at the same points ( see below in figs .",

    "the current @xmath63 $ ] is simply the number of transitions @xmath17 minus the number of reverse transitions @xmath64 along the stochastic path @xmath30 .",
    "the sum over all destinations @xmath65 is just the number how often the system reaches the configuration @xmath66 minus the number how often this configuration is left , hence @xmath67 can only take the values 0 and @xmath68 .",
    "this implies that @xmath69 in the limit @xmath70 , meaning that these particular linear combinations of elementary currents do not contribute to the large - deviation function .",
    "this reduces the degrees of freedom by the number of independent relations ( [ restcurr ] ) , which is maximally @xmath61 .",
    "with periodic boundary conditions . the process can jump between configurations that are connected by a line .",
    ", width=502 ]    in this section we prove that for jump processes with a particular network of states and suitably chosen transition rates one can define a current with a symmetric large deviation function which differs from the one for the entropy .",
    "the structure of this network is shown in fig .",
    "[ networkgeneral ] .",
    "it consist of configurations @xmath71 organized in columns labeled by a lower index @xmath72 , each of them including @xmath73 different configurations labeled by an upper index @xmath74 .",
    "spontaneous jumps are allowed only between configurations in neighboring columns with periodic boundary conditions , as indicated by straight lines in the figure .",
    "moreover , we assume that the number of columns @xmath75 is even and that even columns carry only a single configuration , i.e. @xmath76 .",
    "this forces the system to go through periodically arranged bottlenecks of single configurations .    on this network of configurations we consider the current @xmath77 where @xmath78 are numbers and @xmath79 are the elementary currents defined in eq .",
    "( [ defelementary ] ) .",
    "this current increases by @xmath78 if the process process jumps from column @xmath80 to @xmath81 and decreases by the same amount if the system jumps in the opposite direction , no matter which of the configurations within a column is selected .",
    "assume that the process starts at a particular configuration , say @xmath82 .",
    "depending on the yet unspecified transition rates , the process will perform a random walk from column to column .",
    "whenever it returns to its starting point @xmath82 , it is easy to see that the current defined above will take the value @xmath83 , where @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "the number @xmath86 tells us how often the system completed a cycle through all columns @xmath87 .",
    "therefore , if the rates are chosen in such a way that the random walk through the columns is biased to the right , @xmath86 will be on average positive . with this picture in mind",
    "it is intuitively clear that the expectation value of @xmath86 in the long - time limit is related to the average current through each of the bottlenecks .    to prove this intuitive argument",
    ", we apply the restriction  ( [ restcurr ] ) to each of the configurations in the network . for single but multiply connected configurations at even columns this restriction tells us that the incoming current is equal to the outgoing current in the long time limit , i.e. for even @xmath80 we have @xmath88 for the simply connected configurations in columns with odd @xmath80 , we have instead @xmath89 where @xmath90 . from the above relations it is easy to show that the current in the large deviation regime is given by @xmath91 this result proves that the large deviation properties of the current do not depend individually on the contributions",
    "@xmath78 but only on their sum @xmath92 .",
    "this means that all currents of the form  ( [ ourcurrent ] ) are proportional in the long - time limit and therefore characterized ( up to rescaling ) by the same large deviation function .",
    "we now prove that for suitably chosen transition rates the scaled cumulant generating function of @xmath55 exhibits the symmetry ( [ gcemnonoscaled ] ) .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite we first consider the characteristic polynomial @xmath93 where the sum runs over all permutations @xmath94 of the available configurations . here",
    "@xmath39 denotes the modified generator ( [ modgenerator ] ) with the matrix elements @xmath95        where @xmath96 is again the escape rate  ( [ escaperate ] ) . since the off - diagonal entries represent the possible microscopic transitions only those permutations will contribute to the determinant which correspond to a set of non - intersecting transition cycles . in the network of configurations shown in fig .",
    "[ networkgeneral ] there are three types of closed transition cycles , namely local cycles which do not change the current @xmath55 , and cycles extending over the whole system in positive or negative direction , changing the current by @xmath97 ( see fig .",
    "[ cycles ] ) . in the determinant",
    "this means that permutations corresponding to local cycles are @xmath45-independent since the exponential factors drop out .",
    "conversely , complete cycles extending over the whole system contribute to the sum with terms which are proportional to @xmath98 , respectively .",
    "we can therefore split the characteristic polynomial ( [ charpol1 ] ) into three parts @xmath99 labelling each complete cycle @xmath100 by a multiindex @xmath101 the first two functions can be expressed as @xmath102 where @xmath103 and @xmath104 are the products of all rates along the cycle in forward and backward direction , respectively .",
    "explicitly , @xmath105 moreover , @xmath106 comprises all diagonal entries coming from the configurations that are not involved in the cycle : @xmath107 there is also a complicated expression for @xmath108 but , as we will see below , this function is not needed for finding the symmetry .",
    "clearly , a symmetry of the characteristic polynomial @xmath109 is a sufficient condition for the symmetry @xmath56 of the minimal eigenvalue . because of eq .",
    "( [ pol ] ) this means that the condition @xmath110 implies a gcem symmetry of the current defined in ( [ ourcurrent ] ) .",
    "since @xmath111 and @xmath112 are polynomials in @xmath113 of order @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is the total number of configurations , we can compare the coefficients on both sides .",
    "equating the leading order @xmath116 we obtain @xmath117 the above formula says that @xmath118 is given by the sum of the product of the transition rates of each possible forward cycle that goes trough all the columns ( increasing the current by @xmath119 ) divided by the sum of the product of the transition rates of each possible backward cycle .",
    "the comparison of the @xmath114 remaining orders yields a set of constraints for the transition rates . to this end",
    "we rewrite eq .",
    "( [ req ] ) as a power series @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the elementary symmetric polynomial and where @xmath122 is a set of @xmath114 arguments , consisting of all escape rates which are not part of the cycle labeled by @xmath123 . inserting this power series into eq .",
    "( [ fandfbar ] ) and comparing the coefficients in eq .",
    "( [ constraints ] ) one is led to @xmath114 constraints for the transition rates of the form @xmath124 even though these constraints appear to be complicated , they are fulfilled trivially by setting @xmath125 for all @xmath126 and @xmath90 , meaning that all configurations in the same column have the same escape rate . in this case",
    "the function @xmath127 does no longer depend on the specific choice of the cycle labeled by the multiindex @xmath123 , meaning that the polynomials @xmath111 and @xmath128 reduce to @xmath129 clearly these functions satisfy equation ( [ constraints ] ) , which implies in a symmetric characteristic polynomial and therewith a gcem - like symmetry of the current  ( [ ourcurrent ] ) .    another trivial solution that fulfills the constraints",
    "is the following .",
    "let us take a column @xmath80 that has more than one state and define the quantity @xmath130 where @xmath131 .",
    "if this quantity is constant in all columns with more than one site , i.e. @xmath132 then the ratio @xmath133 is independent on the cycle labeled by the multiindex @xmath123 because the reversal any complete cycle changes the product of the rates always by the same factor , hence we arrive at the symmetry condition @xmath134 finally , we get a larger class of solutions by mixing the conditions ( [ constressimple ] ) and ( [ fkconst ] ) , i.e. , some of the @xmath75 columns with more than one state have constant escape rates while the remaining columns have constant @xmath135 . using similar arguments",
    "one can again show that the ratio @xmath136 is constant and , therefore , the constraints ( [ consym ] ) are fulfilled .",
    "nevertheless , we note that not all the solutions of the constraints equations are of this type .    depending on the transition",
    "rates the current @xmath55 may be proportional to entropy .",
    "if this is the case , then @xmath55 displays the gcem symmetry .",
    "however , when @xmath55 is not proportional to entropy in the large deviation regime and still with a symmetric large deviation function , then we have a symmetry different from the gcem symmetry . in the following",
    "we derive the condition on the transition rates such that @xmath58 is proportional to @xmath55 .    for the network of states shown in fig .",
    "[ networkgeneral ] the entropy current is given by @xmath137 using relation ( [ rest1 ] ) , in the long time limit the above term divided by @xmath21 becomes @xmath138 let us first consider the second solution of the constraints ( [ fkconst ] ) . in this case the quotient of rates appearing in the logarithm does not depend on @xmath139 , therefore , using relation ( [ rest2 ] ) we obtain @xmath140 in this case @xmath55 is proportional to the entropy and thus exhibits a gcem symmetry .",
    "however , we can also conclude in opposite direction that for systems obeying the constraint equations ( [ consym ] ) in such a way that ( [ fkconst ] ) is not satisfied for all @xmath141 , then the current @xmath55 is not proportional to @xmath58 . in this case",
    "we expect to have a new type of symmetry different from the gcem symmetry .",
    "we point out that there is also a multi - dimensional version of the fluctuation theorem @xcite , where the joint probability distribution of a set of currents ( which when summed give the entropy ) displays a symmetric large deviation function .",
    "it is important to note that our symmetry is also different from this multi - dimensional case .",
    "this becomes clear if the fluctuation theorem obtained in @xcite using the cycle decomposition approach @xcite is considered .",
    "following @xcite , the fact that the product of the transition rates associated with a fundamental cycle in a given direction divided by the product of the transition rates in the opposite direction is independent of the states within the cycle , is analogous to our condition ( [ fkconst ] ) holding for all columns .",
    "so far we have considered transition networks shown in fig .",
    "[ networkgeneral ] with an even number of columns @xmath75 .",
    "the above results can be easily generalized to the case where @xmath75 is odd . in this case",
    "there are at least two adjacent columns with only one configuration .    in order to do this generalization",
    "we can consider an index @xmath142 that runs only over columns with more than one state .",
    "note that we might also have odd columns with one state .",
    "moreover we take @xmath143 as the number of columns with more than one state , such that @xmath144 . for the case where we have an even number of columns and all odd columns have more than one state we have @xmath145 and @xmath146 .    note that the number of possible complete forward ( and backward ) cycles is given by @xmath147 and",
    "only the columns with more than one state are relevant in determining a complete cycle . now",
    "if we consider the multiindex @xmath148 and change definition ( [ lambdabig ] ) to @xmath149 the formulas ( [ eqsymmetricfactor ] ) , ( [ defr ] ) and ( [ consym ] ) take the same form if @xmath75 is odd .",
    "therefore , the proof also works for the @xmath75 odd case .",
    "in order to illustrate how this new symmetry can be established we consider some examples of physical systems described by jump processes with a network of states of the type shown in fig .",
    "[ networkgeneral ] , where the current @xmath55 has a clear physical meaning .",

    "a molecular motor is a biological protein that converts chemical energy into mechanical work by hydrolysis of adenosinetriphosphate ( atp ) to adenosinediphosphate ( adp ) and phosphate ( p )  @xcite ( see also @xcite for a review in fluctuation relation for molecular motors ) . unlike macroscopic motors , which move unidirectionally in a well - defined cycle , a molecular motor performs a random walk driven by the chemical potential difference @xmath150 , moving preferentially forward if atp is in excess",
    "this allows one to model molecular motors by stochastic jump processes  @xcite . assuming that the motor is thermally equilibrated with its local environment the jump rate is proportional to @xmath151 , where @xmath152 is the mechanical work to transport the cargo with force @xmath153 over the distance @xmath154 .     and",

    "in such a model the consumption of atp would be proportional to the mechanical work .",
    "however , realistic molecular motors are often characterized by several possible transition cycles , i.e. the motor protein can advance by one step through different paths of intermediate configurations with different energy consumption . in what follows we consider a hypothetical network of four configurations with two transition paths denoted by @xmath156 and @xmath155 , as shown in fig .",

    "the fact that the scape rates are constant simplify the situation considerably : in this case the dependence on the time interval @xmath276 disappears . from now on we assume that the escape rates are constant at column @xmath196 .",
    "the current @xmath55 is a functional that is invariant within the class of trajectories , i.e. , all the trajectories in the same group have the same value of @xmath55 .",
    "this important property comes from the fact the the current ( [ ourcurrent ] ) is defined in a way such that it does not discriminate between different states in the same column .",
    "hence , @xmath55 induces a current @xmath268 defined on a class of trajectories by the relation @xmath277=j_r [ \\overrightarrow{c}_{m , t } ] \\,\\,\\mbox{for}\\,\\ , \\overrightarrow{c}_{m , t}\\in\\{\\overrightarrow{c}_{m , t}\\}. \\label{defjt}\\ ] ] if we consider the current @xmath55 with the increments @xmath278 then it is clear that @xmath279 $ ] is equal to the current given in ( [ current2 ] ) .",
    "it then follows that @xmath280\\exp(-x)\\delta(\\tilde{j}_r[\\{\\overrightarrow{c}_{m , t}\\}]-x)= r[\\{\\overleftarrow{c}_{m , t_f+t_0-t}\\}]\\delta(\\tilde{j}_r[\\{\\overrightarrow{c}_{m , t}\\}]-x)\\,.\\ ] ] now summing over all possible group of trajectories we get @xmath281 .",
    "since relation ( [ defjt ] ) gives @xmath282 we finally obtain @xmath283 this last relation implies the symmetry for the current @xmath55 with the choice of increments ( [ incre ] ) .",
    "however , as we proved in ( [ 1cld ] ) , at large time all the currents @xmath55 are proportional for any choice of increments @xmath78 .",
    "therefore , this argument shows that the symmetry in the current @xmath55 comes also from time - reversal , but at a more coarse grained level .",
    "we point out that functionals of a group of paths have been considered also in @xcite , however in a rather different context .",
    "we believe that the same demonstration can be extended for the more general network of fig .",
    "[ networkgeneral ] .",
    "however , formalizing the proof for this more general case leads to much more cumbersome formulas .",
    "we pretend to address this problem in future work .",
    "in this paper we have investigated a new symmetry of time - integrated currents which is generally different from the gcem - symmetry of the entropy current in the long time limit .",
    "it is valid for a very restricted class of markov processes in the sense that they have the very peculiar network of configurations shown in fig .",
    "[ networkgeneral ] . moreover , the symmetry appears only when the transition rates fulfill a certain set of constraints . nevertheless , to our knowledge , this is the only case where a current not proportional to the entropy in the large deviation regime displays a symmetric large deviation function .",
    "we showed three physical examples where this current is a relevant physical observable .",
    "we considered a toy model for a molecular model , where the mechanical work has a symmetric large deviation function different from the one for the entropy .",
    "moreover , we analyzed two growth models where the height displays such a symmetry .",
    "as is the case of the gcem symmetry , the origin of our symmetry seems to be related to time - reversal .",
    "however , as we showed in sec 5 for a @xmath284 states system , the symmetry becomes clear only when we consider a functional of a group of stochastic trajectories .",
    "that is , the symmetric current as a functional of the group of trajectories is given by the weight of the trajectories divided by the weight of the reversed trajectories .",
    "we demonstrated the symmetry with this grouping of trajectories argument only for the specific @xmath284 states system , but we expect the same kind of proof also to be valid for the whole class of networks considered here .    a natural extension of the this work is to look for other currents , in a more general space of states , with a symmetric large deviation function .",
    "this can be done by looking for the conditions that the transition rates have to fulfill in order for the characteristic polynomial of the modified generator to be symmetric .",
    "we expect that whenever this characteristic polynomial is symmetric , the origin of the symmetry should be related to time - reversal ( of a trajectory or a group of trajectories ) .",
    "one might speculate about a situation where the characteristic polynomial of the modified generator is not symmetric , however its minimum eigenvalue is still symmetric . in this case",
    "the origin of the symmetry might be also related to time - reversal , but of some most probable stochastic trajectory dominating a sum over different trajectories . ultimately , it would be of great theoretical interest for nonequilibrium statistical physics to find out which are the time - integrated currents with a symmetric large deviation function and what might be the origin of these symmetries .",
