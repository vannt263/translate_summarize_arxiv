    "as noted in the main text , several significant upgrades were made to our previous yb - li dual species system @xcite in order to perform the current work . recently @xcite we implemented a new crossed optical dipole trap ( odt ) geometry , leveraging the time - averaged , or  painted , \" optical potential of a rapidly moving laser beam in the horizontal plane to achieve highly efficient yb quantum degenerate gas production .",
    "briefly , we apply a frequency modulated ( fm ) waveform to the input of a voltage controlled oscillator in order to create a time - dependent frequency for driving the acousto - optic modulator ( aom ) , resulting in a time - dependent deflection angle of the first - order diffracted beam .",
    "the fm waveform used results in a nearly perfect parabolic time - averaged trapping potential in the painting dimension . in order to extend this technique to li",
    ", we increase the painting modulation frequency to 60 khz from 10 khz , as the trap frequency of li is 8 times that for yb .",
    "additionally , we implement sub - doppler laser cooling of li using a gray molasses operating on the @xmath99 transition @xcite . after a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) loading time of 2@xmath11s and application of the gray molasses for 300@xmath47s , we have @xmath100 li atoms at a temperature of @xmath101k before loading into the odt . after a 100@xmath11ms hold at 330@xmath11 g in the odt at the full power of @xmath102w per beam and a painting amplitude of @xmath103 m , where @xmath104 m is the gaussian beam waist , we have @xmath105 li atoms at @xmath106k in a 50:50 mixture of the two lowest hyperfine states @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "we then perform forced evaporative cooling of li at 330@xmath11 g by reducing the odt power a factor of 10 in 1@xmath11s , after which @xmath107 atoms remain .",
    "the bias field and field gradient in our experiment point in the vertical direction .    keeping the odt power at a low value",
    ", we subsequently load the yb mot for 5@xmath11s , during which the li number in the odt is unchanged as collisions are absent at zero field in the @xmath21-@xmath22 mixture . in 300@xmath11ms before the yb compression and odt loading phase , we adiabatically increase the odt depth to its maximum value , maintaining the painting amplitude of 390@xmath47 m . after loading @xmath108 yb atoms into the odt , we immediately blast away the state @xmath21 li atoms , for two reasons .",
    "first , since we sympathetically cool li with yb , we do not want to end the yb evaporative cooling sequence with a larger number of li than yb .",
    "second , in order to enter the strongly interacting regime for li , we must sweep the magnetic field up to @xmath6 g to access the @xmath21-@xmath22 feshbach resonance . with a mixture of yb and states",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath22 of li , this sweep results in large inelastic loss as there is a strong enhancement of 3-body collisions on the molecular , or @xmath109 , side of the @xmath6 g feshbach resonance .",
    "we perform forced evaporative cooling of yb in a dynamically shaped optical potential by simultaneously reducing the odt power in an exponential fashion while linearly decreasing the amplitude of painting @xcite , resulting in very efficient cooling of both yb and li .",
    "near the point where yb becomes quantum degenerate , we finish evaporative cooling by increasing the painting amplitude considerably from its minimum value of 80@xmath47 m to 450@xmath47 m while only slightly increasing the odt power from 1@xmath11w to 1.5@xmath11w . at this point ,",
    "the gravitational sag of yb is such that the two clouds are spatially separated and thermally decoupled .",
    "to prepare the 50:50 mixture of states @xmath21 and @xmath22 of li at this point , we ramp the magnetic field to @xmath6 g and perform a 10@xmath11ms landau - zener rf frequency sweep centered at 76.271@xmath11mhz , resulting in the superposition state @xmath110 .",
    "we measure the decoherence of this superposition by measuring the aspect ratio of the li cloud in tof using absorption imaging at 832@xmath11 g as a function of time after the rf pulse .",
    "since the single - state li cloud begins with @xmath111 , the cloud immediately becomes hydrodynamic upon decohering into a spin mixture , resulting in an inversion of the aspect ratio with respect to a non - interacting fermi gas . by this method , we find that the entire cloud is decohered after 100@xmath11ms .",
    "to investigate the gradient - tunable interspecies overlap , we measure the inelastic coupling between the yb and li clouds at 740 g @xcite as a function of @xmath24 , and identify a range of gradients from @xmath112g / cm for which the system exhibits strong interspecies spatial overlap .",
    "[ fig : scatlengths ] displays the bose - bose ( @xmath113 ) , bose - fermi ( @xmath10 ) , and fermi - fermi ( @xmath5 ) @xmath69-wave scattering lengths across the bec - bcs crossover in li .",
    "relevant scattering lengths for the @xmath0yb-@xmath1li dual superfluid system in the vicinity of the 832@xmath11 g feshbach resonance in @xmath1li . the magnetic field independent scattering lengths are @xmath114 for yb - yb ( blue ) and @xmath115 for yb - li ( green ) .",
    "note that the li - li scattering @xmath116 is scaled down by a factor of 100 in the plot . ]",
    "for a finite displacement of the bose and fermi cloud centers , there is a corresponding decrease in the curvature of the mean - field interaction energy as seen by the bosonic component , resulting in a smaller value for the dipole oscillation frequency shift . to estimate the magnitude of this effect for the measurements presented in fig . 2 of the main text , we analytically calculate the mean field shift for a bec executing dipole oscillations with a horizontal displacement of @xmath118 with respect to the center of a unitary fermi gas .    to begin with",
    ", we have the overall bose potential @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the external trapping potential for the boson , @xmath121 is the bose - fermi interaction energy , and we center our coordinate system on the fermi cloud center . at @xmath117",

    "we can then get the mean - field - shifted vertical ( @xmath19 ) frequency for the bosonic component at the point @xmath127 from @xmath128 , giving @xmath129 using eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : unitaryeos ] ) to compute @xmath130 , we get @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the unitary fermi cloud radius , and @xmath133 for @xmath134 , we recover the result from @xcite , @xmath135    for a finite horizontal displacement , we have @xmath136 hence , in order to measure a frequency shift with a systematic error of 10% less than the peak predicted value , the two cloud centers would have to be offset by 44% of the li cloud radius ."

    "<S> our observations imply the existence of a horizontal offset between the two cloud centers which provides a finite impact parameter and therefore non - zero torque during the yb dipole oscillation . in our system , this offset arises due to a combination of slight angular offsets of both the magnetic field gradient direction and the nearly vertical principal axis of the odt with respect to the direction of gravity . </S>",

    "<S> extension of these methods can allow investigation of higher order excitations and sound propagation in the dual superfluid @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our experiments also highlight the use of the differences in mass and electronic structure for the selective excitation and controlled spatial overlap of the components , opening new perspectives for investigating the phase diagram of the bose - fermi superfluid system @xcite . </S>",
