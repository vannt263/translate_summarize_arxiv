    "type i x - ray bursts are thermonuclear explosions that occur on the surfaces of accreting neutron stars in low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) @xcite , and they are triggered by unstable hydrogen or helium burning ( for reviews , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the physics of type i x - ray bursts is generally well understood , and detailed time - dependent one - dimensional models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have been rather successful at reproducing the gross characteristics of bursts , such as their fast rise times of @xmath1 s , durations of @xmath2@xmath3 s , and recurrence times of a few hours to days .",
    "nearly all type i x - ray burst models are one - dimensional and thus implicitly assume that matter accretes spherically onto a nonrotating neutron star .",
    "therefore , ignition occurs simultaneously over the entire stellar surface .",
    "however , these assumptions are clearly inapplicable to the vast majority of accreting neutron stars .",
    "the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ has detected highly sinusoidal oscillations with frequencies of @xmath4@xmath5 hz during bursts in @xmath6 lmxbs ( strohmayer & bildsten 2006 and references therein ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is thought that the burst oscillation frequency corresponds to the neutron star spin frequency ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which implies that many neutron stars that exhibit bursts are in fact rapidly rotating .",
    "indeed , @xcite have shown that the properties of bursts depend sensitively on the neutron star rotation rate , and so rotation must be considered in theoretical burst models . furthermore , since the time required to accumulate a sufficient amount of fuel to trigger a burst is much greater than the duration of the resulting burst , it is highly unlikely that all of the accreted fuel over the entire neutron star surface will ignite simultaneously @xcite .",
    "thus , contrary to the assumptions of most theoretical models , ignition almost surely occurs at a point , and the resulting thermonuclear flame subsequently engulfs the whole stellar surface in @xmath1 s , the burst rise time ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter slu02 ) .",
    "time - resolved spectroscopy and observations of large amplitude oscillations during the rise of some type i x - ray bursts from rapidly rotating neutron stars support this conclusion @xcite .",
    "slu02 investigated the dynamics of localized ignition on a rapidly rotating neutron star .",
    "they found that the latitude at which localized ignition occurs is of great importance in determining the burning front propagation speed .",
    "it can also affect the stability and nature of zonal flows during the decay phase of bursts @xcite , the harmonic content of burst rise oscillations @xcite , and the light curves of non - photospheric radius expansion ( pre ) bursts @xcite .",
    "slu02 assert that , due to the reduction of the effective gravitational acceleration , ignition is likely to occur at the equator of a rapidly rotating neutron star .",
    "however , recent observations suggest otherwise .",
    "@xcite argue that the harmonic content of burst rise oscillations and non - pre double - peaked bursts from the lmxb 4u 1636536 , which harbors a neutron star with spin frequency @xmath7 hz , require ignition to oftentimes occur at or near the rotational pole , at least in this source .    in this letter , we evaluate theoretically the latitude at which type i x - ray bursts on rapidly rotating neutron stars are most probably ignited . in  [ iglat ]",
    "we outline the physics that governs the latitude of type i x - ray burst ignition and determine the ignition latitude as a function of the global accretion rate .",
    "we discuss our results and conclude in  [ discussion ] .",
    "in this section , we first outline the basic physics that determines the latitude of type i x - ray burst ignition on a rapidly rotating neutron star using a simple model .",
    "we then use the global linear stability analysis of @xcite to carry out more detailed calculations .      using the one - zone burst ignition model of @xcite",
    ", we expand upon the work of slu02 to determine the most probable latitude of burst ignition on the surface of a rapidly rotating neutron star .",
    "the reader is encouraged to refer to these works for further details .",
    "we neglect general relativistic corrections throughout for clarity .",
    "following slu02 , we assume that at all times prior to ignition the accreted plasma is in hydrostatic equilibrium and is at rest in the corotating frame ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we presume that the accreted matter spreads in such a way as to minimize the gravitational potential energy of the accreted layer .",
    "the base of the accreted layer is therefore an equipotential surface , and so the pressure at the base of the accreted layer is the same at every latitude ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "hydrostatic equilibrium thus implies that @xmath8 is independent of latitude , where @xmath9 is the pressure at the base of the accreted layer , @xmath10 is the column depth , @xmath11 is the effective gravitational acceleration , and @xmath12 is the latitude .",
    "thus , @xmath13 , and so @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the local mass accretion rate per unit area . according to equation ( 20 ) of @xcite , the column depth at which helium ignites @xmath16 varies as @xmath17 combining equations ( [ sdotpropeqn ] ) and ( [ sigigneqn ] ) gives the ignition time as a function of latitude @xmath18 thus @xmath19 , the time it takes to accrete a critical amount of fuel to trigger a type i x - ray burst , is an increasing function of @xmath11 . due to centrifugal acceleration , @xmath11 is lowest at the equator of a rapidly rotating neutron star , which means that @xmath20 is a minimum at the equator .",
    "therefore , ignition will occur preferentially at the equator ( slu02 ) .",
    "however , nuclear burning on the surface of an accreting neutron star does not always trigger a burst . both theoretical models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest that there is a local critical accretion rate @xmath21 above which nuclear burning is stable , and thus bursts do not occur . by equation ( [ sdotpropeqn ] )",
    ", @xmath21 is related to the global critical accretion rate @xmath0 such that @xmath22 where @xmath23 is defined to be the critical global accretion rate above which nuclear burning is stable at latitude @xmath24 . according to equation ( 24 ) of @xcite , @xmath25 and",
    "so @xmath26 this implies that , since @xmath11 is lowest at the equator and increases towards the rotational pole , there exists a range of accretion rates for which nuclear burning is stable near the equator and unstable near the pole .",
    "consequently , for a given @xmath27 and corresponding critical accretion rate @xmath28 , nuclear burning is stable for all @xmath29 and unstable for all @xmath30 .",
    "clearly , at these accretion rates , bursts will be triggered off the equator .",
    "for @xmath31 , no bursts are triggered at any latitude .",
    "taking the functional derivative of equation ( [ mdotgeffeqn ] ) gives @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 are the spin frequency , mass , and radius of the neutron star , respectively .",
    "thus , for a neutron star with spin frequency @xmath36 , type i x - ray bursts will ignite at the equator for @xmath37 and off of the equator for @xmath38 . within the latter range of accretion rates , the latitude at which ignition occurs is given by @xmath39 , & { \\dot{m}_{\\mathrm{crit}}}(0 )",

    "we see that type i x - ray burst ignition on a rapidly rotating neutron star occurs preferentially near the equator for a wide range of @xmath0 .",
    "however , for a small range of @xmath0 near @xmath42 , ignition occurs at higher latitudes because nuclear burning becomes stable near the equator .",
    "as equation ( [ deltamdot ] ) illustrates , the range of accretion rates over which nonequatorial ignition occurs increases dramatically with @xmath33 .",
    "we now use the global linear stability analysis of @xcite , which is an expanded and improved version of the model of @xcite , to determine the latitude of type i x - ray burst ignition on rapidly rotating neutron stars .",
    "we assume that matter accretes at a global rate @xmath0 onto a rapidly rotating neutron star of mass @xmath43 , radius @xmath44 km , and spin frequency @xmath45 hz , and it spreads over the stellar surface in the same manner as described in  [ basicphysics ] .",
    "we set the composition of the accreted matter to be that of the sun , such that at the neutron star surface the hydrogen mass fraction @xmath46 , helium mass fraction @xmath47 , cno mass fraction @xmath48 , and heavy element fraction @xmath49 , where @xmath50 refers to all metals other than cno .",
    "we plot the ignition time @xmath19 as a function of @xmath0 for @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 in figure [ stabanalysisfig ] .",
    "for @xmath54 , @xmath20 is a minimum at the equator , and so bursts ignite preferentially near the equator , in agreement with both slu02 and equation ( [ tigneqn ] ) . here",
    ", @xmath55 @xmath56 denotes the mass accretion rate at which the accretion luminosity is equal to the eddington limit . for @xmath57 ,",
    "@xmath41 gradually increases with increasing @xmath0 , again in accord with the results of  [ basicphysics ] .",
    "however , figure [ stabanalysisfig ] shows a new regime of bursts for @xmath58 , the regime of `` delayed mixed bursts , '' which was first identified by @xcite .",
    "delayed mixed bursts are mixed hydrogen and helium bursts triggered by unstable helium burning , and they are preceded by a long period of stable nuclear burning . using their global linear stability analysis , narayan & heyl found that , within this range of accretion rates , ( 1 ) the ignition timescale is an increasing function of @xmath0 ( which is consistent with observations , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and ( 2 ) the critical global accretion rate above which delayed mixed bursts occur is an increasing function of the gravitational acceleration @xmath11 .",
    "thus , for the range @xmath59 , although nuclear burning is unstable at all latitudes , ignition occurs preferentially near the pole where @xmath19 is lowest . for @xmath60 ,",
    "nuclear burning becomes completely stable at low latitudes , and ignition again occurs preferentially near the pole . for @xmath61 ,",
    "nuclear burning is stable at all latitudes , and no bursts occur .",
    "the results of both the simple one - zone model of @xcite and the more detailed global linear stability analysis of @xcite suggest that bursts ignite on the equator at low accretion rates and off of the equator at higher accretion rates .",
    "the global linear stability analysis predicts that nonequatorial ignition occurs over a much larger range of @xmath0  nearly @xmath62 for @xmath45",
    "hz versus only about @xmath63 in the one - zone model  and that ignition should occur near the pole for most of this range .",
    "the differences in the results of the two models are due to the delayed mixed burst regime , which is predicted in the global linear stability analysis but not in the one - zone model ( for an explanation of delayed mixed bursts , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in effect",
    ", the delayed mixed burst regime significantly extends the range of @xmath0 over which nonequatorial ignition occurs . the global linear stability analysis and the two - zone model of @xcite",
    "agree better with observations than all other current burst models , but this agreement holds only in a time - averaged sense ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . by this we mean that , while observations imply that the mean ignition time @xmath64 is an increasing function of @xmath0 for @xmath65 , which is in accord with the results shown in figure [ stabanalysisfig ] , the ignition time @xmath19 measured between pairs of bursts observed in nature exhibits significant deviations relative to the mean .",
    "our models can not account for this behavior .",
    "since the predicted burst ignition latitude is model - dependent , and no current model can successfully reproduce the chaotic behavior of bursts , we have little confidence in the accuracy of our predicted ignition latitudes @xmath41 .",
    "however , all theoretical models would predict that bursts ignite preferentially near the equator at low values of @xmath0 and off of the equator at higher @xmath0 .",
    "this result is very robust .",
    "recent observations have generated a renewed interest in the latitude of type i x - ray burst ignition .",
    "first , non - pre double peaked bursts have been observed in a few lmxbs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite argue that ignition near a rotational pole can explain the non - pre double peaked bursts observed in 4u 1636536 , which contains a neutron star with @xmath7 hz . their simple model of nonequatorial ignition and subsequent thermonuclear flame propagation and temporary stalling near the equator qualitatively reproduces both the light curves and spectral profiles of such bursts .",
    "second , although burst oscillations detected in both the rise and decay are usually quite sinusoidal , @xcite report evidence for substantial harmonic content in the oscillations during the rise of a burst from 4u 1636536 .",
    "they again suggest that nonequatorial ignition and subsequent flame propagation can explain the observations .",
    "these authors acknowledged that nonequatorial ignition is at odds with the work of slu02 , who argued for equatorial ignition at all @xmath0 .",
    "our result that nonequatorial ignition is more likely when the accretion rate is high naturally reconciles this discrepancy .",
    "that nonequatorial ignition is preferred at higher @xmath0 may explain why oscillations in the rising phase of some bursts on rapidly rotating neutron stars occur predominantly on the banana branch , i.e. when the inferred accretion rate is high @xcite .",
    "this can be understood as follows .",
    "slu02 find that burning fronts propagate much faster near the equator than near the poles .",
    "if @xmath0 is low and ignition occurs near the equator , the flame will spread in longitude on a timescale that is much shorter than the burst rise timescale and quickly produce an axisymmetric belt .",
    "an observer would detect no oscillations during the rising phase because there is no longitudinal asymmetry . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath0 is high and ignition occurs close to , but not directly at , a rotational pole , the flame will spread in the longitudinal direction on a timescale that is comparable to the burst rise timescale .",
    "this slow longitudinal spread would create a non - axisymmetric hot spot and hence oscillations .",
    "we note that oscillations in the decay phase of some bursts are again observed only when a system is on the banana branch . however , burst oscillations in the decay phase are not well understood theoretically , and we are hesitant to suggest a connection between these oscillations and nonequatorial ignition .",
    "we stress that our results apply only to rapidly rotating , weakly - magnetic neutron stars .",
    "rapid rotation induces a strong latitudinal dependence on the effective gravitational acceleration which restricts burst ignition to a preferred latitude . for a nonrotating ( or slowly rotating ) neutron star ,",
    "all physical quantities are independent of @xmath24 ( or nearly so ) , and ignition could occur at any latitude .",
    "thus , oscillations during the burst rise could occur at any @xmath0 for slowly rotating neutron stars .",
    "strong magnetic fields may channel and confine accreted matter to some region of the neutron star surface . in this case , ignition is more likely to occur within this confinement region than at a specific latitude . although some bursts observed from the accreting millisecond pulsar sax j1808.43658 exhibit timing features that @xcite suggest originate from midlatitudinal ignition , we speculate that it is due to magnetic confinement ."
