    "redshift relation for sne  ia provides the only _ direct _ evidence for a cosmic acceleration .",

    "as projects are developed which plan to probe sne  ia beyond @xmath5=1 for this purpose ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it becomes important to understand the possible limitations of using sne  ia as distance probes .",
    "key issues relating to the diversity of sne  ia and their possible evolution with redshift as a population , together with the limiting effects of dust and/or color corrections to their photometric properties , are particularly crucial to understand .",
    "several local studies have already indicated correlations between sn  ia properties and host galaxy morphologies .",
    "more recently , @xcite have shown that the properties of distant sne  ia appear to be a direct function of their local stellar population , with the distribution of light curve widths and hence peak luminosities correlating with the host galaxy specific star - formation rate .",
    "this work also determined that the rate of sne  ia per unit stellar mass of their host galaxies is larger in actively star - forming galaxies , suggesting many must be produced quite rapidly in recently formed stellar populations , perhaps suggestive of more than one progenitor mechanism .",
    "the authors conclude that sne  ia may well be a bimodal or a more complex population of events ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such diversity in the properties of sne  ia could have far - reaching implications , particularly if the _ mix _ of mechanisms or delay times within the broad population gradually changes with look - back time ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "these recent developments , which illustrate how improved precision reveals new physical correlations in the sn  ia population , raise the broader question of whether future sn  ia experiments might be limited in precision by variations of a systematic nature within the population , for example with redshift , which can not be removed via empirical correlations .",

    "in addition , it is not always practical at low redshift to cover the full wavelength range necessary to test for systematic trends .    in this paper",

    "our aim is obtain a substantially higher signal - to - noise in the spectra than that typically obtained during spectroscopic programs to type sne and measure redshifts .",

    "little is known about the properties and homogeneity of the uv spectra of sne  ia , largely because of the absence of suitable instruments for studying this wavelength range in local events .",

    "* ) , the bulk of the progress now possible in this area can be provided from optical studies of intermediate - redshift events with large ground - based telescopes .",
    "the goals of this paper are thus to address the question of both the diversity and possible physical evolution in the intermediate redshift sn  ia family .",
    "we compare the rest - frame uv behavior of local sne  ia with that derived for intermediate - redshift ( @xmath10.5 ) events where the rest - frame uv enters the region of high efficiency of the keck lris - b spectrograph .",

    "was scheduled from 2003 through 2005 .",
    "the goal was to obtain substantially higher signal - to - noise ratio spectra than those required for sn typing ( particularly in the rest - frame uv ) , and hence we targeted sne  ia with a mean redshift lower than that of the snls as a whole ( @xmath0=0.45 versus @xmath0=0.6 ) and used integration times @xmath13 34 times longer for that redshift .    to avoid spectroscopic screening of every candidate ( results from the mainstream vlt and gemini programs were typically not available at the time of the keck observations ) , a code was developed to constrain the redshift , sn type and epoch from the available photometric data ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) . in selecting candidates for this program ,",
    "the following criteria were adopted :    1 .",
    "the sn photometric redshift lay at @xmath5@xmath20.75 , 2 .",
    "the predicted phase was such that the keck observations would be conducted prior to or close to maximum light .",
    "the light curve and color were consistent with a sn  ia ,    in practise , this last criteria is conservatively applied to minimize the risk of selecting against sne  ia which may differ from the template used in our selection code , though this reduces the fraction of sne  ia observed : by the end of 2005 , after 20 nights of keck time , 58 sn candidates were observed of which 36 were confirmed as sne  ia ( @xmath1360% )",
    ". a higher fraction of sne  ia could have been obtained by a more rigorous application of the pre - selection technique ; this argues that any bias introduced by our selection is small .",
    "table  [ tab : sninfo ] summarizes the key parameters for the sne  ia sampled in the keck campaign ( an independent survey of sne  iip was also undertaken during this period @xcite . )",
    "we restrict these 36 sne to a high - quality subset , removing 3 as spectroscopically peculiar ( see @xmath8  [ sec : mean - uv - spectrum ] ) , 2 with a low - s / n keck spectrum , and 5 with poor @xmath14 light curve coverage which precludes an accurate subtraction of the host galaxy from the sn spectrum ( see table  [ tab : sninfo ] ) .",
    "these later 5 were all observed during the snls `` pre - survey '' when the light curve coverage in @xmath14 was less dense , and hence our photometrically calibrated sn spectrum will suffer a greater systematic uncertainty ( see @xmath8  [ sec : spectr - calibr - host ] ) .",
    "analysis of the remaining 26 sne  ia forms the basis of this paper .",
    "[ fig : redshiftphasehist ] displays the redshift distribution of these high - quality sne  ia and the breakdown in phase at which the keck spectra were obtained .    for comparison purposes",
    ", we will also make use of an additional sample of 160 spectroscopically - confirmed snls sne  ia ( without high quality keck coverage ) within the above redshift range for which good broad - band photometric data is available .",
    "this will be used as a control to demonstrate our sn  ia selection is unbiased relative to the larger snls population in terms of fundamental properties such as light curve stretch , host galaxy type and location within each host .",
    "all spectroscopic observations of snls sne presented here were conducted with the 10 meter keck - i telescope using the two - channel low resolution imaging spectrograph ( lris ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "although sne  ia have broad absorption features , the need to monitor expansion velocities to reasonable precision as well as to locate narrower diagnostic lines which would otherwise be blended in broader features defined the need for intermediate ( 600 l mm@xmath15 ) dispersion gratings .",
    "access to the rest - frame uv over 0.2@xmath2z@xmath20.7 was a prime goal given the sensitivity of features in this region to metallicity , temperature and photospheric expansion velocity .",
    "taking these considerations into account , we adopted a spectroscopic set up using a 400 linemm@xmath15 grating blazed at 8500  ( giving a dispersion of @xmath16 ^ -1@xmath17 ) on the red side and a 600 line grism blazed at 4000  ( dispersion @xmath18 ^ -1@xmath17 ) on the blue side . with a 5600  dichroic",
    ", this gave a contiguous wavelength coverage from the atmospheric limit on the blue side through to 9400  on the red side .",
    "on some of the earliest runs in 2003 , we experimented with a 300 line grism blazed at 5000(dispersion @xmath19 ^ -1@xmath17 ) on the blue side and a 600 line grating blazed at 7500  ( dispersion @xmath20 ^ -1@xmath17 ) on the red side with a 6800  dichroic .",
    "this provided a lower resolution on the blue side , but a more optimal set up on the red side for the higher redshift sne .",
    "however , we found the 6800  dichroic did not permit accurate flux calibration on the blue side , because of residual contamination in the second order of diffraction . in very good seeing conditions , we used a 0.7  slit , otherwise a 1  slit was used .",
    "observations were performed at the parallactic angle ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "each individual exposure was typically between 1200 - 1800s , and the sn was dithered along the slit by 3 - 5  between exposures to aid with fringe removal in the data reduction .",
    "the telescope was refocused periodically during each night from which an estimate of the seeing was measured .",
    "table  [ tab : observinglog ] summarizes these spectroscopic observations .",
    "all spectroscopic data were processed using a pipeline developed by one of us ( ms ) .",
    "this pipeline uses both standard image reduction and analysis facility ( iraf ) software as well as our own custom - written routines .",
    "lris is a two - arm spectrograph and different reduction techniques are required on each side as the red side suffers significant fringing above 7000 .",
    "our first step is to remove the overscan level on each amplifier of each ccd , and then subtract a master zero - frame constructed on the afternoon of each night of observing to remove any bias pattern .",
    "both sides are then divided by a normalized internal flat - field which removes pixel - to - pixel sensitivity variations .",
    "this division also corrects for the different gains of the lris ccd amplifiers .",
    "the 0.7  slit additionally requires division by a `` slit - flat '' or `` illumination '' flat - field as the slit illumination is quite uneven , presumably due to milling defects in the slit .",
    "an additional complication is that the spatial position of the slit on the ccd can drift by several pixels over the course of the night , so the slit - flat is shifted to best match each observation .",
    "cosmic - rays are then identified using lacosmic @xcite and removed via interpolation from neighboring pixels .",
    "we perform our sky subtraction following the technique of @xcite , which subtracts a two - dimensional sky frame constructed from sub - pixel sampling of the background spectrum and a knowledge of the wavelength distortions as determined from two - dimensional arc comparison frames . for the blue side",
    ", we proceed directly to the spectral extraction after sky subtraction ; on the red side we perform an additional fringe correction before extraction .    to generate the master fringe frame , we first divide every sky - subtracted frame by the two - dimensional sky frame that was subtracted and that caused the fringing , resulting in a two - dimensional map of the fringe strengths per photon for each exposure . all individual fringe maps taken in a given configuration are averaged with sigma - clipping to form a master fringe frame , masking out regions in each exposure that contain object flux , and weighting each frame by the exposure time of the observation .",
    "as the observations are dithered , the objects are located on a different part of the ccd in each frame , and the fringe strength at every pixel is therefore sampled across an entire night . finally , we boxcar smooth the master fringe frame to increase the signal - to - noise ratio in the fringes , which typically extend over several pixels .",
    "this smoothed , master fringe frame is then scaled and subtracted from each red - side exposure at the stage prior to sky - subtraction , and the sky - subtraction then repeated on the fringe - subtracted images .",
    "the two - dimensional frames are transformed to a constant dispersion using comparison arc lamp images .",
    "because the objects under study typically have a reasonable signal - to - noise ratio , the spectral extraction was performed by tracing the object position on the ccd and using a variance - weighted extraction in a seeing matched aperture , equal to 1.25 times the seeing .",
    "an error spectrum from the statistics of the photon noise is also extracted at the same time .",
    "the wavelength calibration of each extracted spectrum is then tweaked using the position of the night - sky lines to account for any drift in the wavelength solution during a given night .",
    "we then perform an approximate telluric and relative flux calibration using spectrophotometric standard stars taken from @xcite , and correcting for typical mauna kea atmospheric extinction using the extinction law of @xcite and the effective airmass of each exposure .",
    "we note that flux calibration errors introduced during this process that vary smoothly as a function of wavelength will be corrected by our calibration to the sn lightcurves described in the next section .    following optimal combination of the different exposures and relative flux calibration of the blue and red components , our final step is to scale the two sides into a single calibrated spectrum .",
    "we first match the flux across the dichroic by defining narrow box filters either side of the dichroic and scale each spectrum appropriately .",
    "we then use a weighted mean to combine the spectra , in the process re - binning to a constant 2  per pixel resolution .",
    "the result is a contiguous science spectrum , together with an error spectrum representing the statistical uncertainties in the flux in each binned pixel .    where possible , we measure redshifts from lines in the host galaxy spectrum . in some cases",
    "the host galaxy was too faint , or the sn too isolated from the host galaxy , to measure a redshift from the galaxy lines , and the redshift was determined from template fits to the sn spectrum ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "as a final step prior to scientific analysis we interpolate across the positions of host galaxy emission features ( e.g. , h@xmath21 , h@xmath22 , , etc . ) to remove these from the spectra .",
    "the sne  ia themselves were identified by a lack of hydrogen in their spectra , combined with broad ( several thousand kms@xmath15 ) p cygni lines of elements such as , , , , and blends of fe peak lines .",
    "the classification of sne is discussed extensively in the literature ; see for a review , and @xcite , , @xcite , and @xcite for issues associated with high - redshift sn classification .",
    "snls as a whole adopts the numerical classification scheme presented in @xcite for typing sne : a confidence index ( ci ) that a given spectrum is of a sn ia .",
    "three classifications denote sne  ia : `` certain sn ia '' ( ci:5 ; type denoted as sn  ia ) , `` highly probable sn ia '' ( ci:4 ; type denoted as sn  ia ) and `` probable sn  ia '' ( ci:3 ; type denoted as sn  ia@xmath23 ) . in all of the spectra in this paper ,",
    "the relatively low - redshift compared to the snls sample as a whole , coupled with the long integration times , results in high signal - to - noise ratios ensuring the classifications are unambiguous .",
    "all sne  ia presented here are ci=5 on the snls scheme .",
    "although standard spectrophotometric stars were observed periodically on each observing night , these provide only an approximation to a flux calibrated spectrum .",
    "complexities such as differential slit - losses ( as the seeing is wavelength dependent ) and uncertain atmospheric extinction corrections require a more rigorous treatment .",
    "furthermore , a key issue in the interpretation of sn spectra is the removal of underlying contaminating flux from the host galaxy , which for some high - redshift spectra can be significant .",
    "we adopted a procedure for removing the host galaxy spectrum that takes advantage of the photometric @xmath24 host - galaxy data available from the snls , as well as the near - simultaneous snls @xmath9 sn light - curve photometry , ensuring that each spectrum is carefully corrected to be consistent with the appropriate broad - band sn colors .",
    "we begin by measuring the surface brightness of each galaxy ( in flux units per square arcsecond ) at the position of the sn in a series of small apertures ( with radii of 1 - 8 pixels ) for each of the @xmath24 filters .",
    "these fluxes were measured from deep stacks with no sn light present , constructed for the purpose of studying the properties of the sn host galaxies @xcite .",
    "the image quality of these stacks was around 0.8  in each filter , similar to the seeing for the majority of our lris spectral observations .",
    "the amount of host galaxy light present in each sn spectrum is then estimated by interpolating the galaxy surface brightnesses at the seeing of the observation , and then multiplying by the product of the slitwidth ( @xmath25 ) and the spectral extraction aperture ( 1.25@xmath10seeing ; @xmath8  [ sec : data - reduction ] ) , giving a series of @xmath24 fluxes representing the host galaxy contamination in our spectra . we then fit a series of smooth galaxy spectral energy distribution ( sed ) templates to these flux data to estimate the contaminating host galaxy spectrum .",
    "these templates are generated by the galaxy spectral synthesis code pgase.2 rebinned to the resolution of our sn spectra .",
    "we interpolate between neighboring galaxy spectra to find the best - fitting template .",
    "the resulting spectrum represents the estimate of the contaminating host galaxy continuum in every sn spectrum .",
    "we next use the @xmath9 snls light curves and their resulting light - curve parameterization ( using the lightcurve fitter sifto ; conley et al .",
    ", in prep ) to interpolate the sn flux at the time of each spectral observation from nearby light - curve observations .",
    "due to the rolling - search nature of the snls and the dense light curve coverage , most of the spectra in our main sample have @xmath14 photometric data within 2 rest - frame days of the spectroscopic observation , and all have data within 4 days ( table  [ tab : sninfo ] ) , hence the interpolation required is small .",
    "we next estimate the amount of sn flux that went through the lris slit and was inside the spectral extraction window of 1.25@xmath10seeing , and hence is present in the reduced spectrum .",
    "we model the sn psf as a two - dimensional gaussian with @xmath26 and integrate this gaussian through an rectangular aperture of @xmath25@xmath10(seeing@xmath101.25 ) , where @xmath27 is calculated at the effective wavelengths of the @xmath9 filters adjusting the seeing as @xmath28 .",
    "this estimates the fraction of the total sn flux that passed through the slit , mimicking the inclusion of differential slit - losses .",
    "these adjusted sn fluxes are added to the host galaxy fluxes to generate combined `` sn+host '' @xmath9 fluxes , the estimate of the amount of flux that passed through the slit .",
    "we correct our combined , contiguous and flux - calibrated spectrum to have the same colors and absolute flux level as dictated by these `` sn+host '' fluxes using a smooth interpolating multiplicative spline function ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the size of the correction made to the observed spectrum is usually @xmath210% and is invariably a monotonic function of wavelength .",
    "we then subtract our best - fitting host galaxy template , and adjust the resulting spectrum to have the correct colors of the sn on the night of observation ( again using a spline function ) , giving a sn spectrum with the correct relative and absolute flux calibration .",
    "this final multiplicative adjustment is small and essentially corrects the subtracted spectrum for differential slit losses .",
    "we note that this technique would not be possible without either the @xmath24 host galaxy fluxes , or the densely - sampled @xmath9 sn  ia light curves .",
    "we estimate the uncertainty in the host subtraction process using a monte - carlo simulation .",
    "we repeat the subtraction for each sn 500 times , but adjusting the different variables ( seeing , host - galaxy fluxes , sn fluxes ) according to their uncertainties and assuming normal distributions .",
    "we assume a 15% uncertainty in the seeing , and also simulate errors in the centering of the sn in the slit , introduced during target acquisition or by telescope tracking errors , of @xmath29  ( 1@xmath27 ) .",
    "where appropriate , we use these 500 simulated spectra to estimate errors due to host galaxy subtraction in derived quantities ( such as spectral colors ) in later sections .",
    "we also carry forward in our analysis the statistical error arising from the photon statistics in our spectra ( @xmath8  [ sec : data - reduction ] ) .",
    "our final task is to correct the sn  ia spectrum for the effects of extinction in the milky - way . to correct for galactic extinction ,",
    "we use the dust - maps of @xcite and a @xcite extinction law .",
    "we defer the more complex discussion of extinction in the sn host galaxy and intrinsic sn color variations until later .",
    "we illustrate the results of this process for all 26 of our high quality sne  ia in fig .",
    "[ fig : eghostsub ]",
    "we now turn to the two key questions our dataset is designed to address :    1 .",
    "has there been significant evolution in the mean sn  ia spectrum since @xmath10.5 - a period of 5 gyr corresponding to the past 37% of cosmic history ?",
    "2 .   to what extent are there intrinsic spectral variations in our sample ?",
    "do these give indications that sne  ia are a more complex population than assumed in cosmological studies , and might these variations limit the use of sne  ia in future cosmology experiments ?      we will begin to address these questions by exploring the role that our rest - frame uv data offers as a proxy for _ progenitor metallicity_. the possible effects of progenitor metallicity , either as a function of redshift through galaxy evolution , or as a function of environment or host - galaxy luminosity , can be explored through blanketing and wavelength dependent features in the rest - frame uv corresponding to @xmath30 2900 - 3500 . at z@xmath40.2 ,",
    "this portion of the rest - frame spectrum is well - sampled in our lris data . in making the assumption that our uv data are indicative of metallicity effects , it should be realized we are relying largely on theoretical studies ; the uv spectral region is poorly explored observationally .",
    "first we review the various theoretical expectations .",
    "@xcite argue that direct traces of the progenitor metallicity can best be seen in the unburned sn layers which are only observable significantly before maximum light .",
    "however , they also predict that an increase in progenitor metallicity will cause an increase in the amount of @xmath31fe synthesized in the explosion , and this will result in an increase in line opacity in the uv region which may be observable at maximum light .",
    "the degree of mixing in the explosion complicates the interpretation , however . the net effect predicted by hflich et al .",
    "is that an increased metallicity will result in an _ increase _ in the uv pseudo - continuum at maximum light .",
    "@xcite start with the findings of @xcite and examine the spectroscopic implications in greater detail . using the starting isotopic distribution of the w7 model ( nomoto et al .",
    "1984 ) , they simultaneously change the progenitor metallicity in the unburned c+o region and increase the amount of @xmath31fe in the partially burned region .",
    "they find two effects  a shift in the wavelength of uv features redward with decreasing metallicity , and a simultaneous increase in the level of the uv pseudo - continuum .",
    "they argue that as metallicity decreases so the line opacity decreases with the result that lines form deeper in the atmosphere , and therefore from a lower velocity region .",
    "a lower metallicity also decreases the cooling producing a higher temperature and bluer colors .",
    "we note that such a color difference is _ opposite _ to the effect predicted by hflich et al . however , lentz et al .",
    "caution that the overall uv flux level is not necessarily a good indicator of metallicity , as it is dependent on many variables such as the temperature , density and velocity of the c+o layer .",
    "@xcite argue for much more dramatic changes in sn  ia physics with metallicity .",
    "they argue that synthesized @xmath32ni mass should be linearly proportional to progenitor metallicity . since the decay of @xmath32ni drives the luminosity , sne  ia in high metallicity environments should be less luminous .",
    "this is because stars from higher metallicity environments will end up with larger mass fractions of @xmath33ne and @xmath32fe after helium burning .",
    "since these isotopes have excess neutrons , the authors argue that in these cases fewer radioactive elements are produced during the process of burning to nuclear statistical equilibrium during a sn  ia .",
    "note that these results are in sharp contrast to other studies which found no significant increase in @xmath32ni with increasing metallicity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* )    finally , we note that various authors predict that the sn  ia rate should be affected by metallicity , although they do not make explicit predictions about the resulting effects on sn  ia properties .",
    "@xcite argue that in very low metallicity environments ( @xmath34 < -1 $ ] ) the white dwarf wind that they believe is essential for producing sne ia will be inhibited , thus leading to fewer sne  ia .",
    "find that metallicity differences should alter the range of progenitor masses that produce sne  ia .    in summary",
    "therefore , theory can not yet offer us a clear consensus as to the effects of metallicity on the uv properties of sne  ia .",
    "indeed , there is disagreement not only about which effects are the most important , but also about the sign of any possible effect .",
    "this is a very challenging theoretical problem hindered by correlations between the wanted effect of metallicity and other correlations such as the viability of certain progenitor systems , the explosion mechanism and radiative transfer in an atmosphere under a variety of mixing conditions .",
    "full simulations of all these effects may soon become feasible , but substantial campaigns will still be needed to track statistical shifts with metallicity .",
    "we therefore undertake an empirically - motivated study of the properties of supernovae in the uv , and note where the observations agree or disagree with certain theoretical studies . in this respect",
    ", it is helpful to have some theoretical basis for making the empirical measures .",
    "[ fig : col_lentz ] illustrates , for the range of metallicities sampled by @xcite , that the bulk of the spectral changes would clearly be detectable within our rest - frame wavelength range . the blanketing and wavelength shifts apparent in fig .",
    "[ fig : col_lentz ] suggest the use of both photometric and spectroscopic diagnostics .",
    "as high quality uv spectra are in scarce supply at low redshift , we can best make meaningful comparisons using rest - frame @xmath35 measurements .",
    "as our spectra do not always extend to the full redward end of the standard @xmath36 filter , we will also adopt a top - hat filter extending from 4000 to 4800  which we will refer to as @xmath37 .",
    "pseudo - photometric ultraviolet measures can be constructed from our spectral data using two top - hat filters , uv1 and uv2 , centered around regions where the strongest trends are predicted .",
    "although these various photometric measures degrade the information content of our spectra , they have the considerable benefit of being consistent over a wide range in redshift without making any assumptions about the k - correction .",
    "the metallicity - induced spectral shifts discussed above can likewise be tracked by measuring the rest wavelengths of two uv features at @xmath302920 and 3180   .",

    "accordingly , first we will verify whether this is the case by comparing the distribution of properties with those for the parent snls sn  ia sample .",
    "this parent sample ( n=160 ) includes those presented by , as well as further events up to may 2006 , restricted to lie within our chosen redshift range 0.15@xmath400.7 .",

    "kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) tests indicate the keck and snls sample distributions in all four parameters are consistent with being drawn from the same distribution ; the exception is the stretch distribution where the k - s test indicates the distributions are possibly different due to a marginal deficiency of low stretch events in the keck sample .",

    "otherwise , the larger scale environs in which our sne  ia occurred seem quite representative of the parent population , for example in the specific star formation rate , the separation from the host galaxy , and ( not shown in fig .",

    "examining fig .",
    "[ fig : mean_max ] , it is clear that the spectrum at @xmath440.5 is reasonably similar to its local equivalent .",
    "the agreement , particularly longward of 4000 , is reassuring , indicating that there has been no significant evolution in the mean sn  ia spectroscopic properties over the past 5  gyr .",
    "however , some systematic departures are seen , for example , in the / doublets at @xmath454150  and in the positions of the uv features around 2900 - 3200 .",

    "we see that the local spectrum lies within the 90% confidence boundary in the distribution of @xmath10.5 spectra .",

    "this supports the claims of @xcite : at high redshift , where the fraction of star forming hosts is higher , more `` prompt '' sne are found and these tend to have broader light curves .",
    "the lack of a comprehensive local sample with comparable quality to the keck data extending into the uv clearly limits any precise tests for spectral evolution .",

    "systematic _ change with redshift in the uv spectra of sne  ia .",
    "the bulk of the differences seen probably arise from a natural dispersion within the sample and it seems reasonable to assume this dispersion is present at all epochs . in the next section we explore the possible origin of this uv dispersion .      in this section",
    "we first consider the physical reality of the dispersion seen in the uv spectra at maximum light .",
    "the bootstrap - resampled variations ( figs .  [",
    "fig : mean_max ] and  [ fig : mean_early ] ) indicate a greater degree of scatter at @xmath47  than in the optical around @xmath48 .",
    "however , both the effects of dust extinction and the size of the calibration uncertainties are unaccounted for in these comparisons .",
    "could the increased dispersion simply arise as a result of one or both of these effects and not represent a true physical variation amongst our sne ?",
    "we first discuss the effects of dust extinction .",
    "an explanation for the uv variations is the presence of varying amount of interstellar dust , either in each host galaxy or along the line of sight to the observer .",
    "correcting the properties of sne  ia for extinction is currently one of the most pernicious problems in their use as cosmological probes ( e.g. , see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "earlier analyses @xcite , based on the first generation of sn  ia surveys , examined the range of likely extinction using both sn colors and host - galaxy morphologies as markers .",
    "generally only modest levels of extinction ( @xmath49 ) were seen at high - redshift across the full range of host types , with no evidence of any systematic change with redshift in the samples used for cosmological analyses .    in the case of the present snls sample ,",
    "the key diagnostic is the rest - frame @xmath50 color estimator `` @xmath51 '' , essentially the @xmath50 color measured at maximum light .",
    "we wish to test whether dust is the primary cause of the uv variations seen in the keck spectra .",
    "this can be done by considering , statistically , correlations between the uv spectra and @xmath51 .",
    "reddening measures for each sn are not directly output by the snls analysis since @xmath51 is treated as an empirical variable when performing the cosmological analysis ; no physical model is assumed for the color variations .",
    "however , we can readily test the hypothesis that the bulk of the uv dispersion arises from reddening that is linked to the @xmath50 variations .",
    "we investigate two methods for color - correcting our sne  ia spectra .",
    "the first is to use a standard reddening law ( @xcite , ccm ) and extinction - correct each individual keck spectrum using that sn s @xmath51 measurement and a value of @xmath52 , suitable for standard milky - way type dust .",
    "the results from this process are not particularly sensitive to either the exact @xmath50 color used as the fiducial / zeropoint sn  ia color , nor to the exact value of @xmath53 used .",
    "our second approach is similar but uses the salt color law together with the @xmath51 estimated from the light curve fits .",
    "as this color law was trained on local sn spectra and colors , it includes not only the effect of dust extinction but may also partially account for intrinsic variations between sn optical colors and uv fluxes unrelated to dust .",
    "the ccm and salt laws have a similar form in the optical , but differ in the near - uv , where the salt law implies more `` extinction '' in the uv than the ccm law . to test the validity of these approaches we split those keck spectra studied at maximum light into two sub - samples according to whether the rest - frame maximum light optical color is redder or bluer than a @xmath51=-0.057 .    examining the mean uv spectra for the two subsets ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mean_max_col ] ) , we find that , before any correction , optically bluer sne  ia do indeed have more flux in the uv as expected if they are less extincted . when the spectra are individually color - corrected using a ccm law and then combined by subset , the mean uv spectra agree better though the entire color difference is not corrected shortward of 3500 .",
    "the approach using the salt color law performs better in this uv region , and provides a good agreement across our entire wavelength range , but is unable to correct all the differences seen . given the slightly superior performance of the salt color law , we adopt this approach for color - correcting our spectra in the remainder of this paper .",
    "our host galaxy subtraction and spectral calibration procedures are described in @xmath8  [ sec : spectr - calibr - host ] . for each host - subtracted and photometrically - calibrated sn spectrum",
    "we also record a series of 500 monte - carlo simulated spectra generated by randomly varying the sn fluxes , host galaxy fluxes , seeing and sn position in the slit according to the observational errors .    for each of the sn studied ,",
    "we estimate the 1-@xmath27 uncertainty as follows . in each wavelength bin for a given sn , we order the 500 random spectra and find the range in flux that encompasses 68% of the population and assign this flux range as the 1-@xmath27 error in this wavelength bin .",
    "this is repeated in every wavelength bin for all the spectra , providing the error from the observational uncertainties for each sn spectrum as a function of wavelength .",
    "we can then assess whether the scatter that we see about the mean spectrum is significant .",
    "for every spectrum , we calculate the residual from the mean spectrum and divide by the appropriate error spectrum .",
    "the result is the deviation from the mean for each spectrum in units of sigma .",
    "smoothed versions of these are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : meandisp ] ; the top panel shows the deviation for the uncorrected spectra , the middle and lower panels show the deviations for spectra corrected using the ccm and salt laws as described in @xmath8  [ sec : dust ] .",
    "in general , the scatter is markedly larger in the uv ( @xmath54 ) than in the optical region . in the optical ,",
    "the spectra appear well - behaved , with most of the deviations @xmath22@xmath27 , consistent with a mean spectrum showing little intrinsic dispersion over the broad wavelength range .    these tests and those of the previous section demonstrate that most of the difference in the _ average _ continuum levels seen between the mean uv spectra of optically blue and red sne  ia can be corrected using existing techniques such as the ccm dust extinction law or the salt sn  ia color law .",
    "however , these techniques can only reduce , and not eliminate , the scatter observed , which is significantly larger than that expected from a consideration of the observational uncertainties . we thus conclude that the bulk of the dispersion is intrinsic to our sne and investigate its origin in the next sections .",
    "given we have established that the uv variations are larger than those expected from photometric errors and are still present after attempts to correct for color differences , it is important to consider the extent to which the intrinsic dispersion we see is consistent or otherwise with that observed locally .",
    "although no comparable local spectroscopic dataset exists , @xcite have analyzed a homogeneous photometric database of 44 local sne  ia and examined the @xmath35 color dispersion at maximum light in terms of both the light curve stretch factor @xmath55 and redder colors such as @xmath50 .",
    "as in the higher redshift data , there is still the complication of separating the effects of host galaxy dust extinction and intrinsic color effects . in the jha et al .",
    "study , host galaxy extinction estimates were available for a subset of the data yielding intrinsic @xmath35 and @xmath50 colors . the increased intrinsic dispersion seen in the @xmath35 vs. stretch relationship with respect to that in @xmath50",
    "can thus be attributed primarily to an increased dispersion in the @xmath56 band of @xmath570.12 ( @xmath4512% ) .",
    "also address the question of the intrinsic dispersion in @xmath56 by comparing the photometric properties of that subset of snls sne  ia for which some of the @xmath9 bands map conveniently onto rest - frame @xmath58 .",
    "they estimate the quantity @xmath59 which is the difference between the @xmath56 band flux at maximum light predicted from a suitably - chosen triplet of observed filters drawn from @xmath9 and the actual observed @xmath56 magnitude . as the machinery adopted by astier et al .",
    "includes provision for a color - stretch relation , this is not quite the same test as that adopted by jha et al . , although the local scatter found in @xmath59 is comparable ( 0.12 ) .    we compare our intermediate redshift @xmath60-stretch relation with that derived from the local sample in fig .",
    "[ fig : col_stretch ] . in this figure",
    "all colors are color - corrected using a salt color law and the method of @xmath8  [ sec : dust ] . to derive the rest - frame @xmath60 and @xmath51 measures for the low-@xmath5 sample , we re - perform the light curve fits to the sn photometry using the same fitter used for the snls sample ( sifto ; conley et al . in prep ) .",
    "clearly , at maximum light the trends are very similar .",
    "as discussed in @xmath8  [ sec : selection - cfhtls - sne ] , the keck sample ( and the snls sample in general ) is slightly under - represented in low - stretch sne  ia compared to the local data ( fig .",
    "[ fig : samplecomparison ] ) , so the color - stretch relation found in previous studies is less evident .",
    "crucially , there is no evidence that the colors derived directly from the keck spectra show a larger photometric dispersion . for events with stretch @xmath610.85 we find @xmath62=-0.452 with a standard deviation of 0.132 for 15 keck sne  ia c.f . -0.436 ( 0.167 ) for 41 local events .",
    "the small difference in mean color probably arises from the different selection criteria , as jha et al .",
    "are able to include events with greater extinction .",
    "note there are small differences in the definition of `` maximum light '' ; the keck spectra range over -4 to + 4 days which will add an additional scatter to this sample in the presence of color evolution with phase .    a similar behavior is seen in the @xmath63-stretch relation ; a modest dispersion together with a weak correlation with stretch and a slight phase dependence ( the definitions of uv1 and uv2 are shown in fig.[fig : col_lentz ] ) .",
    "however , a marked increase in scatter is seen in the @xmath64-stretch relation ( as expected if the uv1 filter is the more sensitive to variations in progenitor composition ) together with a stronger evolution with phase .",
    "although the uv1 filter is the shortest wavelength probed by the keck spectra , this dispersion is considerable even within a phase bin , and is unlikely to arise from spectrophotometric errors given the tight dispersion observed in the @xmath65 relation .",
    "[ fig : col_stretch ] also shows weak correlations between color and stretch in the sense that the high stretch ( brighter ) events are bluer than those of low stretch ( fainter ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "clearly as the sne  ia develop they display an increased dispersion in the wavelength region where metal - dependent features are expected to be most prominent .",
    "this may indicate that the metallicity of the outer , unburned layers , seen only at early times , is not as important as expected by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "instead line blanketing from iron - peak elements may play the dominant role in affecting the uv opacity .",
    "this may affect maximum - light and post - maximum spectra more than for pre - maximum spectra .",
    "at early times the photosphere has not yet receded into the bulk of the iron - peak elements , and , as time progresses , @xmath32ni synthesized in the explosion decays into @xmath32co and subsequently into @xmath32fe .",
    "these additional isotopes may provide the increased line blanketing seen in the spectra .",
    "next we consider trends in the spectroscopic features introduced by @xcite as possible metallicity diagnostics ; these are marked as @xmath38 and @xmath39 in fig .",
    "[ fig : col_lentz ] .",
    "the wavelengths of these features have the advantage of being independent of any dust correction .",
    "if progenitor evolution is largely driven by metallicity effects , we might expect significant shifts to occur in these features between the local and high - redshift data .",
    "in fact , a cursory examination of our mean spectra ( figs .",
    "[ fig : mean_max ] and  [ fig : mean_early ] ) shows that the features do not appear to shift significantly in the mean .",
    "however this could be due to an inadequate or unrepresentative local data .",
    "we have seen that this is a significant limitation .",
    "accordingly , we measured the wavelength of both features for each of our spectra individually . for each feature",
    "we fit a gaussian on a linear continuum background , returning the central wavelength .",
    "the error is estimated by varying the continuum definition either side of the feature , performing the fit 100 times , and taking the standard deviation of the resulting central wavelength distribution .",
    "the precision is typically @xmath662 - 5 , adequate to detect the shifts of @xmath4510  predicted by @xcite .",
    "we found a much greater sn to sn scatter of @xmath6660 , with no obvious trend with stretch as might be expected from fig .",
    "[ fig : col_stretch ] .",
    "however , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bumps_phase ] , for both features there is a possible shift with phase in the sense both move gradually to longer wavelength as the sn expands .",
    "moreover , there is a considerable dispersion at a particular phase , particularly before maximum light .",
    "we find that @xmath39 correlates reasonably well with the wavelength of the 4130  - a line commonly used to measure the photospheric expansion ( fig .  [",
    "fig : siii_lambda2 ] ) .",
    "thus , to first order , the scatter seen in @xmath39 at a particular phase appears to arise from variations in kinetic energy within the sample .",
    "however the phase - dependent trend suggests a further process is at work .",
    "[ fig : ratio_phase ] shows the wavelength ratio versus phase , coded by stretch , where there is a noticeable shift at maximum light ( corresponding to a redward shift of 50  in @xmath39 ) .",
    "this shift presumably arises as a result of the effects of temperature and ionization changes which are more pronounced in the uv feature .    in summary ,",

    "[ fig : col_stretch ] is dependent on the stellar population and total stellar mass .    the keck sn  ia dataset samples a wide range of passive and star - forming host galaxies ( fig .",

    "finally , the feature at 4130  is shallower in high - stretch sne consistent with trends identified by @xcite .",
    "one of the original motivations for this study was to explore both evolution in the mean properties of sne  ia over 0@xmath400.5 and the dispersion in their uv spectra .",
    "we have seen remarkably little evidence of evolution in the mean spectroscopic properties over this interval , confirming , with higher precision , earlier suggestions based largely on lower - s / n data .",
    "the primary limitation in this aspect of our paper is the paucity of high quality uv data at low redshift .",
    "most of the earlier constraints on the possible evolution of sne  ia were largely based on consideration of photometric measures .",
    "for example , @xcite derived the rest - frame @xmath35 and @xmath50 distributions of a heterogeneous sample of sne  ia at maximum light over z@xmath21.5 as a proxy for the more precise constraints possible with spectroscopic data .",
    "they ruled out any color evolution greater than 0.02  mag in the mean in @xmath35 .",
    "spectroscopic data is substantially more precise in its tracking of evolution and dispersion than broad - band photometry for two reasons .",
    "foremost , detailed differences in key line diagnostics are lost in photometric data .",
    "secondly , no assumptions need be made about @xmath6-corrections in gathering and comparing data over a broad redshift range .    at the time this keck survey was underway",
    ", there was no comprehensive spectroscopic dataset against which our uv data could be compared , other than the mean template published by @xcite and discussed in @xmath8  [ sec : local - data ] . however , very recently , as a result of a survey of high - redshift sne  ia with the acs grism onboard hubble space telescope , @xcite have published the mean rest - frame uv spectrum of 13 sne  ia more distant ( @xmath7 ) than those studied here ; the average redshift of this sample is @xmath0=1.3 .",
    "in this study , used to demonstrate the presence of dark energy at @xmath721 , it is claimed that the sample - averaged spectral energy distributions observed at @xmath721 are consistent with that observed locally and that any spectral evolution is still undetected .",
    "however , no quantitative statement is made to support this claim .",
    "we believe that the spectral comparison undertaken by @xcite is less precise than that undertaken in this study , and hence less valuable as a means of justifying the continued use of local relations in constructing sn  ia hubble diagrams .",
    "foremost , the acs grism data samples sne  ia over a much wider range of phase than the comparisons undertaken here .",
    "although the individual spectra comprising the mean @xmath5=1.3 acs spectrum are not tabulated by @xcite , their phases range over at least 15 - 20 days and almost all are post - maximum light , compared with the narrow phase range maximum - light ( -4 to + 4 days ) and pre - maximum light ( @xmath2 - 4 days ) comparisons presented here .",
    "a second consideration is the inevitable poor signal - to - noise ratio of these very high redshift spectra which precludes detailed comparisons .    as we have shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : mean_max ] and  [ fig : mean_early ] , the local template @xcite is a poor basis from which to make such comparisons .",
    "more representative datasets are needed for reliable claims . internally within our own data ,",
    "[ fig : mean_max_z ] reveals little evolution although the redshift baseline is small",
    ". it will be important to examine the case for evolution from 0.2@xmath401.5 by combining in a consistent manner both the @xcite dataset with that presented here , as well as with higher - redshift snls sne  ia ( out to @xmath73 ) observed during the routine survey spectroscopic screening ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the second significant finding in this study is the marked increase in the dispersion among our sne  ia shortward of 3300(fig .",
    "[ fig : col_stretch ] ) .",
    "although the scatter in @xmath56 is comparable to that seen in local data , it increases significantly at shorter wavelengths . even allowing for differing amounts of dust extinction within each host galaxy ,",
    "this amounts to more than a factor of 2 variation in continuum flux at maximum light .",
    "although theoretical models predict a strong sensitivity to metallicity variations at this wavelength , our variations are also considerably larger than those predicted .",
    "we have demonstrated that a color correction based on the @xmath50 color of the sn and either a ccm milky way extinction law or a salt color law , can only marginally reduce , and not eliminate , this uv dispersion .",
    "we have found it hard to isolate the physical causes of this significant uv dispersion .",
    "we confirm earlier work at longer wavelengths ( @xmath743500 - 4000 ) that shows that stretch ( or equivalently host galaxy class ) is partially responsible .",
    "however at the shortest wavelengths ( @xmath753000 - 3300corresponding to our uv1 diagnostic ) , additional effects are clearly important that are not accounted for by the color - correction techniques in use in current cosmological programs .",
    "in addition to the newly - found intrinsic scatter at short wavelengths , new trends with phase are also seen in the wavelengths of diagnostic features in this region .",
    "redward of 4000   , corrections for stretch or color work well in normalizing sne ia , however blueward of 4000a , significant scatter remains even after such corrections are made .",
    "this may be related to a change in the dominant source of opacity in sneia .",
    "redward of 3500 - 4000  electron scattering opacity dominates , but at uv wavelengths a forest of overlapping lines is the dominant source of opacity ( see fig . 1 of ) .",
    "electron scattering is a continuous process involving well - understood physics , but line opacity depends sensitively on abundances , ionization states , and possibly non - lte effects .",
    "[ fig : opac_max ] illustrates this point by comparing the wavelength dependence of the line and electron scattering opacity at maximum light for a model by @xcite that provides a good match for a normal sn  ia ( kason , priv . commun . ) .",
    "the data in question refers to that at a depth of 7000 kms@xmath15 where intermediate mass and fe peak material are well - mixed .",
    "a common feature in these models is the drop in line opacity compared to the electron scattering opacity near 4000   as seen here .",
    "thus it is understandable that the emerging uv flux is highly susceptible to changes in the line opacity ( due to initial conditions and/or material synthesized during the explosion ) while the optical and near - ir spectral behavior are dominated by electron scattering opacity at this phase .",
    "what are the possible consequences of the above variations in terms of the use of sne  ia as probes of the expansion history ? in the highest redshift surveys , including those proposed with future facilities , cross - color @xmath6-corrections are needed to estimate rest - frame light curves from the observations , typically undertaken in the far - red and near - infrared for @xmath721.5 @xcite .",
    "this necessitates the adoption of a suitable template whose sed is reliable in the 3000 - 4000  region . at the most fundamental level",
    ", the dispersion in our uv spectra will contribute a statistical uncertainty at the 0.05 - 0.1 magnitude level depending on how precisely particular observed filters match to the chosen rest - frame bandpasses .",
    "a more worrying bias would follow the adoption of an incorrect template .",
    "possibly the most significant finding in our work is the demonstration that the mean uv spectrum is different for high and low stretch sne  ia ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mean_max_s ] ) and thus , presumably , for those that occur in passive and actively star - forming galaxies @xcite . adopting a single template would lead to a systematic bias which could become increasingly serious at high redshift where the mix between the two populations changes and high - stretch sne , typically originating from younger progenitor systems , become increasingly common .",
    "recently , @xcite have demonstrated the existence of an increased fraction of high - stretch sne  ia at higher redshifts above and beyond the selection effect that high stretch , brighter sne  ia are easier to detect .",
    "using our individual maximum light spectra , we can evaluate the impact of the uv dispersion on sample cross - color @xmath6-corrections , addressing both the statistical error arising from the intrinsic scatter and the systematic difference arising from the stretch - based spectral differences we have found .",
    "[ fig : kcorrections ] shows the result .    for a typical future dark energy experiment , based on securing the equation of state parameter @xmath3 to 5% using @xmath721 sneia , photometric corrections of better than @xmath660.02 mag",
    "are required .",
    "this requirement is indicated on fig .",
    "[ fig : kcorrections ] .    in terms of the _ statistical _ error ,",
    "the observed dispersion is typically @xmath660.05 - 0.10 mag , larger than that required by a factor of several .",
    "however , such a dispersion , if randomly distributed , need not present a fundamental obstacle to progress with a survey spanning a wide redshift range utilizing a large number of sne ia . as fig .",
    "[ fig : kcorrections ] shows , at certain redshifts where the rest - frame and observed filters closely match , the dispersion has negligible effect and sneia at these redshifts could be more heavily weighted .",
    "the more worrying trend , particularly given the recent demonstration of stretch bias by @xcite , is the likelihood of a _",
    "systematic _ error introduced by adopting an incorrect template for the redshifts where the rest - frame and observed filters do not overlap .",
    "[ fig : kcorrections ] shows the potential of this error via a comparison of the dispersion independently for high and low stretch events .",
    "the differences between these two categories are comparably large and indicate the importance of securing a physical understanding of the uv variations seen in our survey .",
    "we summarize our findings as follows :    1 .",
    "we have secured high signal - to - noise ratio keck spectra for a sample of 36 intermediate redshift sne  ia , observed at various phases , spanning the redshift range 0.15@xmath400.7 , and drawn from the supernova legacy survey ( snls ) .",
    "we demonstrate via inspection of the sn properties that our keck sample is a reasonably fair subset of the larger sample of distant sne  ia being studied by the snls .",
    "we develop a new method for removing host galaxy contamination from our spectra based on measures of the galaxy and sn photometry .",
    "these refinements to traditional spectral reduction techniques allow us to achieve host - galaxy subtracted and flux - calibrated rest - frame spectra of high quality , extending down to rest - frame wavelengths of 2900 .",
    "although no strong evidence is found for spectral evolution in the mean early - phase and maximum light spectra , when compared to local data , such evolutionary tests are hampered by the paucity of quality data at low redshift and a significant scatter in the spectra shortward of 4000 .",
    "we find no evidence for evolution internal to our data .",
    "we argue that the well - used local uv spectral template @xcite is likely to be less representative than the mean spectrum compiled from the keck data which we tabulate with the measured dispersion for use in future cosmological applications .",
    "our principal finding is a large scatter from one sn to the next in the rest - frame uv spectrum even after standard dust corrections are made . by constructing various photometric bandpasses that avoid uncertainties arising from differential @xmath6-corrections associated with the range of redshifts in our sample ,",
    "we show that while we can reproduce the stretch - dependent trends seen locally at 3500 - 4000 , the scatter at 3000 - 3400  is 3 - 5 times larger .",
    "although progenitor metallicity may drive some of the trends seen in the keck data , the uv variations are much larger than in contemporary models which span the expected metallicity range . moreover , the uv spectrum also changes with phase in a manner which is not consistent with models .",
    "we conclude there are significant variations in the uv properties of sne  ia which are not accounted for by either the presently - employed empirical trends or the available sn  ia models .",
    "6 .   as an illustration of the importance of understanding these new results",
    ", we calculate the error arising from the use of a single uv spectral template for calculating the cross - color @xmath6 correction , a correction essential for constructing the sn  ia hubble diagram as a probe of the expansion history .",
    "the dispersion arising from our uv spectra , if not randomly distributed along the hubble diagram , presents an uncertainty 2 - 3 times larger than than would be necessary for recovering the equation of state parameter @xmath3 to 5% using sne  ia at @xmath11 .",
    "we conclude that further detailed studies are essential if sne  ia are to be useful for precision measures of dark energy .",
