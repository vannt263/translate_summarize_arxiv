    "in financial mathematics , the fair value @xmath0 of a european style option on two underlying assets is modelled by the two - dimensional _ black  scholes partial differential equation _ ( pde ) , see e.g.  @xcite , @xmath1 for @xmath2 . here",
    ", @xmath3 denotes the time to maturity @xmath4 and we assume real parameters @xmath5 .",
    "the pde is provided with an initial condition that is defined through the payoff of the option .",
    "the mixed spatial derivative term in represents the correlation between both asset prices in the two - dimensional black  scholes model .",
    "mixed spatial derivative terms are very important , notably , in the field of financial option valuation theory . here",
    "they arise due to the correlation between underlying stochastic processes .    a well - known approach for determining the fair values @xmath6 consists of numerically solving pde ( [ eq:2dblackscholes ] ) by the _ method - of - lines _",
    ", whereby one first discretizes in space and subsequently in time . in this paper",
    "we consider a uniform cartesian grid and second - order central finite difference schemes in space .",
    "this semidiscretization is second - order convergent with respect to the spatial mesh width if the initial and boundary data is smooth , see e.g.  @xcite . when the pde is multidimensional , then the application of classical implicit time discretization methods to the obtained semidiscrete systems can be computationally very intensive . in view of this , for the effective time discretization , operator splitting schemes of the _ alternating direction implicit _ ( adi ) type are widely considered . in this paper",
    "we consider the _ modified craig ",
    "sneyd ( mcs ) scheme _",
    "@xcite , which is a prominent scheme of the adi type . in the past years various positive stability results for the mcs scheme",
    "have been derived relevant to multidimensional convection - diffusion equations with mixed derivative terms , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "recently , in t hout and wyns @xcite proved that , under some natural stability and smoothness assumptions , the mcs scheme is second - order convergent with respect to the time step whenever it is applied to semidiscrete two - dimensional convection - diffusion equations with mixed derivative term .",
    "the temporal convergence result from @xcite has the crucial property that it holds uniformly in the spatial mesh width .",
    "hence , the fully discrete numerical solution is second - order convergent in space and time for smooth initial and boundary data .",
    "a relevant convergence analysis for the mcs scheme and nonsmooth data is still open in the literature . in financial applications , however , the initial function is in general nonsmooth .",
    "it is well - known that convergence can then be seriously impaired . as an illustration ,",
    "consider a two - asset cash - or - nothing option with strikes @xmath7 and @xmath8 , so that @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the indicator function .",
    "in the upper left plot in figure [ fig : digitalcall2 ] , the numerical solution for @xmath6 is shown for ( natural ) financial parameter values @xmath11",
    "@xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 .",
    "irregularities can be observed around the strikes , leading to a loss of accuracy in the maximum norm . for hedging purposes it is important to consider also the greeks , for example the cross gamma @xmath18 .",
    "the corresponding pde is given by @xmath19 for @xmath2 .",
    "this is supplemented with initial function @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the _ dirac delta function_. the lower left plot in figure [ fig : digitalcall2 ] shows the numerical solution for the cross gamma at maturity @xmath4 for the same financial parameter values as above . around the point",
    "@xmath22 strong , spurious erratic behaviour shows up and , hence , this approximation is useless in practice .",
    "if the cross gamma is approximated by applying finite difference schemes directly to the numerical solution for the option value , which is a common alternative technique in practice , the same observations are found .    for one - dimensional applications in finance ,",
    "the impact of nonsmooth initial data on convergence has already been studied extensively and various techniques have been proposed in order to recover standard convergence results , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "a common technique consists of first applying several implicit euler ( sub)steps and then continue with the time stepping scheme under consideration , @xcite .",
    "this is called _ rannacher time stepping _ or _ implicit euler damping_.    consider again pdes ( [ eq:2dblackscholes ] ) and for the two - asset cash - or - nothing option . replacing the mcs scheme in the first two timesteps by four half - timesteps of the implicit euler scheme , the two right plots in figure [ fig : digitalcall2 ] are obtained . clearly , there are no longer irregularities or oscillations present . in many other multidimensional applications ,",
    "see e.g.  @xcite , the same observations were made . to the best of our knowledge , however , there are no theoretical results available in the literature concerning the favourable effect of rannacher time stepping on the convergence of the mcs scheme if the initial data is nonsmooth .    in the present paper",
    "we will prove a useful convergence bound for the mcs scheme when it is applied to a model two - dimensional convection - diffusion equation with mixed derivative term , provided with dirac delta initial data . here",
    ", semidiscretization is performed with second - order central finite difference schemes . the precise influence of rannacher time stepping on the order of convergence will be investigated .",
    "our analysis in this paper is inspired by that of giles and carter @xcite , who deal with the crank - nicolson scheme applied to a model one - dimensional convection - diffusion equation .",
    "we make use of a two - dimensional mixed discrete / continuous fourier transformation and analyse the asymptotic behaviour of the fourier transform . by applying then the inverse transformation we arrive at an error bound for the total error .",
    "the sharpness of the error bound is confirmed by ample numerical experiments .",

    "scheme starts with an explicit euler stage applied to the full system , which is followed by two implicit corrections corresponding to each of the two spatial directions .",
    "subsequently an explicit update is performed , followed again by two implicit unidirectional corrector stages .",
    "note that both @xmath24 and @xmath27 , which contain the mixed derivative term , are always treated in an explicit manner .",
    "each implicit stage handles spatial derivatives in only one spatial direction .",
    "this can lead to a major computational advantage in comparison to classical non - splitted implicit time stepping methods .",
    "consider the coordinate transformation @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the pde ( [ eq:2dblackscholes ] ) is then transformed into @xmath43 for @xmath44 .",
    "this provides a motivation for considering a constant coefficient model convection - diffusion equation with mixed derivative term @xmath45 for @xmath46 and with @xmath47 .",
    "we supplement equation ( [ eq : modelpde ] ) with the initial condition @xmath48 which arises for example in the case of the cross gamma of a two - asset cash - or - nothing option .",

    "semidiscretization of ( [ eq : modelpde ] ) with second - order central finite difference schemes then gives rise to approximations @xmath68 of the exact solution value @xmath69 which are defined by the system @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 with @xmath73 the usual second - order central finite difference operators .",
    "for example , @xmath74 semidiscrete system ( [ eq : semidiscretesystem ] ) is provided with initial data @xmath75 in order to approximate the dirac delta initial function . for convenience",
    "we define @xmath76 and we denote by @xmath77 the identity operator .",

    "this provides a numerical approximation @xmath88 of the exact solution .",
    "the goal of our convergence analysis consists of quantifying the _ total error _",
    "@xmath89 to do so , we will analyse the asymptotic behaviour of a mixed discrete / continuous fourier transform for @xmath90 simultaneously tending to zero . applying",
    "the inverse fourier transformation on the resulting error in fourier space will yield a useful bound for the total error .",
    "special attention will be paid to the influence of @xmath83 , i.e.  the influence of rannacher time stepping , on the total error .",
    "we consider a mixed discrete / continuous fourier transform pair , cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite , @xmath91 for ease of presentation , the dependency of the fourier transform on @xmath92 and @xmath93 will be omitted in the notation .",
    "fourier transformation of @xmath94 yields @xmath95 .",

    "next , if either @xmath123 or @xmath124 is medium and the other one is small or medium ( region ) , then both the fourier transforms of the numerical solution and analytical solution are negligible . in the _ high - wavenumber region _ , i.e.  where both @xmath127 are large , we observe that the modulus of the fourier transform @xmath126 is close to zero .",
    "the modulus @xmath128 , however , is strongly dependent on @xmath83 and the mcs parameter @xmath38 . for larger values of @xmath38",
    "we see that @xmath125 has a larger magnitude in the high - wavenumber region .",
    "hence , a larger high - wavenumber error can be expected for larger values of @xmath38 .",
    "further we observe that the modulus of @xmath125 in the high - wavenumber region is always damped whenever rannacher time stepping is applied .",
    "this matches our observations from figure [ fig : digitalcall2 ] where unwanted erratic behaviour was avoided by using rannacher time stepping .",
    "finally , we have the case where either @xmath123 or @xmath124 is large but the other one is not . in our analysis , the region where @xmath123 is large and the region where @xmath124 is large will be treated separately . in both regions",
    "the fourier transform @xmath126 is negligible but @xmath125 has to be further analysed .",

    "the maximum error between our numerical solution and the exact solution is shown as a function of @xmath348 for different values of @xmath339 . in the lower plots we show the same maximum error for one value of @xmath339 , together with our theoretical estimates for the corresponding low - wavenumber error and high - wavenumber error . in these lower plots",
    "it is clearly seen that our theoretical estimates for the total error are sharp .    for the case where no rannacher time stepping is applied , the left plots in figure [ fig : convergence13 ] reveal second - order convergence behaviour until @xmath139 reaches a critical value where the high - wavenumber error starts exceeding the low - wavenumber error .",
    "it can be observed that this value of @xmath139 , and thus the high - wavenumber error , is highly dependent on the ratio @xmath352 . for smaller values of @xmath339 , @xmath344 is only sizeable whenever @xmath139 is very small , whereas for larger values of @xmath339 , @xmath344 already dominates the total error for larger values of @xmath139 .",
    "moreover , the error constant for the low - wavenumber error is also dependent on @xmath339 .",
    "however , this is much less pronounced than for the high - wavenumber error .",
    "the right plots in figure [ fig : convergence13 ] show the corresponding results in the case where the first two mcs timesteps are replaced by four backward euler half - timesteps , thus @xmath144 .",
    "one observes that the numerical approximations now exhibit second - order convergence for all values of @xmath339 . in the bottom right plot",
    "the high - wavenumber error is not visible since it is strongly dominated by the low - wavenumber error .",
    "the same observation is made for other values of @xmath339 .",
    "hence , whenever rannacher time stepping is applied with @xmath144 , the total error can be approximated by @xmath353 , which is of second - order in @xmath139 .",
    "we find that the error constant for the low - wavenumber error is mildly dependent on the ratio @xmath352 .",
    "this can be explained through the fact that for a fixed value of @xmath139 but smaller value of @xmath339 the same semidiscrete system is solved with a smaller timestep @xmath354 .",
    "finally , we notice that the latter error constant is slightly larger than for the case where @xmath143 .",
    "thus , by applying rannacher time stepping with @xmath144 , second - order convergence can be recovered at the small cost of a marginally larger error constant for the low - wavenumber error .",
    "as stated above , the high - wavenumber error is very sensitive to the mcs parameter @xmath38 . to illustrate this , figure [ fig : convergence1 ]",
    "shows the same plots as in figure [ fig : convergence13 ] but with the mcs parameter replaced by @xmath40 .",
    "it can be seen that all the conclusions from figure [ fig : convergence13 ] remain valid . in order to get decent plots , however , it is necessary to consider smaller values for @xmath339 .",
    "this confirms that , for fixed @xmath339 , @xmath344 is strongly increasing as a function of @xmath38 .",
    "moreover , by comparing the upper plots of figure [ fig : convergence13 ] and figure [ fig : convergence1 ] for @xmath355 it can be seen that the error constant of the low - wavenumber error is substantially larger for mcs parameter @xmath40 than for @xmath356 .",
    "we conjecture that for fixed @xmath339 and fixed @xmath139 , the low - wavenumber error is also increasing as a function of @xmath38 .",
    "therefore , regardless of the number of rannacher timesteps @xmath83 , it seems more favourable to consider smaller values of @xmath38 .",
    "in particular , the lowest value of @xmath38 which satisfies the restrictions from subsection [ subsec : stability ] for all values @xmath357 is given by @xmath39 .",

    "hence , the fourier error can be approximated by @xmath364 the inverse mixed discrete / continuous fourier transform of @xmath365 is given by @xmath366 as @xmath113 tend to zero this can be approximated by @xmath367 making use of a symmetry argument and a one - dimensional inverse fourier transformation , @xmath368 can be rewritten as @xmath369 with @xmath370 where @xmath371 denotes the density function of a standard normally distributed random variable .",
    "it is readily seen that @xmath372 , respectively @xmath373 , reaches its highest magnitude near the points @xmath341 where @xmath374 , respectively @xmath375 .",
    "for the numerical experiments , the integrals in @xmath372 and @xmath373 are approximated by numerical integration . combining the expressions , and leads to the following approximation of the total error : @xmath376    from approximation ( [ eq : totalerrorapproxcs ] )",
    "it can be concluded that the total error is also @xmath377 when cs time stepping is considered .",
    "this matches the observations from the plots in figure [ fig : convergencecs ] which show convergence results for the same problem as in subsection [ convergencemcs ] but with mcs parameter @xmath37 .",
    "the lower plots indicate again that our theoretical estimates for the total error are sharp . without rannacher time stepping , i.e.  @xmath143 , the results in figure [ fig : convergencecs ] show second - order convergence in @xmath139 until @xmath368 starts exceeding the low - wavenumber error .",
