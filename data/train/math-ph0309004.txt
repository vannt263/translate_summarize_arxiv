    "in this paper we study the nature of the spectrum of the almost mathieu operator @xmath6 on @xmath1 , where @xmath4 is a real parameter , @xmath3 is an irrational number and @xmath7 . since for each @xmath4",
    "this is a bounded self - adjoint operator , the spectrum is a compact subset of the real line which does not depend on @xmath8 because of the assumption on @xmath3 .",
    "this spectrum will be denoted by @xmath9 .",
    "for @xmath10 , this set is the interval @xmath11 $ ] .",
    "the understanding of the spectrum of ( [ eq : almostop ] ) is related to the dynamical properties of the difference equation @xmath12 for @xmath13 , which is sometimes called the harper equation . in what follows",
    "we will assume that the frequency @xmath3 is diophantine :    we say that a real number @xmath3 is diophantine whenever there exist positive constants @xmath14 and @xmath15 such that the estimate @xmath16 holds for all @xmath17 .",
    "the nature of the spectrum of this operator has been studied intensively in the last twenty years ( for a review , see last @xcite ) and an open problem has been to know whether the spectrum is a cantor set or not , which is usually referred as the `` ten martini problem '' . in this paper",
    "we derive two results on this problem .",
    "the first one is _",
    "non - perturbative _ :    [ res : debil ] if @xmath3 is diophantine , then the spectrum of the almost mathieu operator is a cantor set if @xmath2 .    here , we prefer to call this result a corollary , rather than a theorem , because the proof requires just a combination of reducibility , point spectrum and duality developed quite recently for the almost mathieu operator and the related eigenvalue equation .",
    "the argument is in fact reminiscent of ince s original argument for the classical mathieu differential equation ( see @xcite ) . in the critical case @xmath18 ,",
    "y. last proved in @xcite that the spectrum of the almost mathieu operator is a subset of the real line with zero lebesgue measure and that it is a cantor set for the values of @xmath3 which have an unbounded continued fraction expansion , which is a set of full measure .",
    "this last result has been extended recently to all diophantine frequencies by avila & krikorian @xcite .",
    "the cantor structure of the spectrum of the almost mathieu operator can be better understood if we make use of the concept of _ rotation number _ , which can be defined as follows .",
    "let @xmath19 be a non - trivial solution of ( [ eq : almosteq ] ) , for some fixed @xmath20 let @xmath21 be the number of changes of sign of such solution for @xmath22 , adding one if @xmath23 .",
    "then the limit @xmath24 exists , it does not depend on the chosen solution @xmath25 , nor on @xmath8 and it is denoted by @xmath26 . a more complete presentation of this object can be found in section [ sec : prerequisites ] .",
    "here we only mention some properties which relate it to the spectrum of @xmath27 :    [ res : propietats ] the rotation number has the following properties :    * the rotation number , @xmath26 , is a continuous function of @xmath28 * for a fixed @xmath4 , the spectrum of @xmath29 , @xmath9 , is the set of @xmath30 , such that @xmath31 is not locally constant at @xmath32 . *",
    "@xmath33*gap labelling*@xmath34 if @xmath35 is an open , non - void interval in the resolvent set of @xmath29 , @xmath36 , then there is an integer @xmath37 such that @xmath38for all @xmath39 that is , @xmath40 where @xmath41 denotes the fractional part of a real number .    from this theorem",
    "we conclude that the resolvent set is the disjoint union of countably ( or finitely ) many open intervals called _ spectral gaps _ , possibly void , and which can be uniquely labelled by an integer @xmath42 called the _",
    "resonance_. if the closure of a spectral gap degenerates to a point we will say that it is a _ collapsed gap _ and otherwise that it is a _ non - collapsed gap_. see figure [ fig : dualitats ] for a numerical computation of the biggest gaps in the spectrum of the almost mathieu operator for several values @xmath4 .    in particular",
    "if , for a fixed @xmath4 , all the spectral gaps are open and the frequency @xmath3 is irrational , then the spectrum @xmath9 is a cantor set .",
    "the question of the non - collapsing of all spectral gaps is sometimes called the _ strong ( or dry ) ten martini problem_. however , if non - collapsed gaps are dense in the spectrum , then this is still a cantor set , although some ( perhaps an infinite number ) of collapsed gaps may also coexist .",
    "now we can formulate the second corollary in this paper :    [ res : fort ] assume that @xmath43 is diophantine .",
    "then , there is a constant @xmath44 such that if @xmath45 or @xmath46 all the spectral gaps of the spectrum of the almost mathieu operator are open .    before ending this introduction we give a short account of the existing results ( to our knowledge ) on the cantor spectrum of the almost mathieu operator for @xmath47 .",
    "the cantor spectrum for the almost mathieu operator was first conjectured by azbel @xcite and kac , in 1981 , conjectured that all the spectral gaps are open .",
    "the problem of the cantor structure of the spectrum was called the `` ten martini problem '' by simon @xcite ( and remained as problem 4 in @xcite ) .",
    "sinai @xcite , proved that for diophantine @xmath3 s and sufficiently large ( or small @xmath48 ) , depending on @xmath3 , the spectrum @xmath9 is a cantor set .",
    "choi , elliott & yui @xcite proved that the spectrum @xmath9 is a cantor set for all @xmath49 when @xmath3 is a liouville number obeying the condition @xmath50 for a certain constant @xmath51 and infinitely many rationals @xmath52 .",
    "in particular , this means that for a @xmath53-dense subset of pairs @xmath54 the spectrum is a cantor set , which is the bellissard - simon result @xcite .",
    "for generic results on cantor spectrum for almost periodic an quasi - periodic schrdinger operators see moser @xcite and johnson @xcite . nevertheless , collapsed gaps appear naturally in quasi - periodic schrdinger operators , as it was shown by broer , puig & sim @xcite and there are examples which do not display cantor spectrum , see de concini & johnson @xcite .",
    "finally , let us mention that , if we consider the case of rational @xmath3 , all spectral gaps , apart from the middle one , are open if @xmath55 .",
    "this result was proved by van mouche @xcite and choi , elliott & yui @xcite .",
    "let us now outline the contents of the present paper . in section [ sec :",
    "prerequisites ] we introduce some of the tools needed to prove our two main results .",
    "these include the different definitions of the rotation number , the concept of reducibility of linear quasi - periodic skew - products and the duality for the almost mathieu operator . in section [ sec : fort ]",
    "apply the reducibility results by eliasson to prove corollary [ res : fort ] .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : debil ] , the proof of of corollary [ res : debil ] is given , which is based on a result of non - perturbative localization by jitomirskaya .",
    "the rotation number for quasi - periodic schrdinger equations is a very useful object with deep connections to the spectral properties of schrdinger operators .",
    "it is also related to the dynamical properties of the solutions of the associated eigenvalue equation .",
    "this allows several equivalent definitions , which we shall now try to present .",
    "the rotation number was introduced for continuous time quasi - periodic schrdinger equations by johnson & moser @xcite .",
    "the discrete version was introduced by herman @xcite ( which is also defined for quasi - periodic skew - product flows on @xmath56 ) and delyon & souillard @xcite ( which is the definition given in the introduction ) .",
    "we will now review these definitions , their connection and some important properties .",
    "herman s definition is dynamical .",
    "here we follow the presentation by krikorian @xcite .",
    "write equation ( [ eq : almosteq ] ) as a _ quasi - periodic skew - product flow _ on @xmath57 @xmath58 setting @xmath59 and @xmath60 which belongs to @xmath61 the group of bidimensional matrices with determinant one .",
    "the quasi - periodic flow can also be defined on @xmath56 considering the flow given by @xmath62 with @xmath63 .",
    "this can be seen as the iteration of the following _ quasi - periodic cocycle _ on @xmath56 : @xmath64 which we denote by @xmath65 .",
    "we will now give herman s definition of the rotation number of a quasi - periodic cocyle like ( [ eq : cocycle ] ) with @xmath66 homotopic to the identity .",
    "for a general @xmath66 , this last property is not always true , since @xmath67 is not simply connected . indeed",
    ", its first homotopy group is isomorphic to @xmath68 , with generator the rotation @xmath69 given by @xmath70 for all @xmath71 . in our case , the _ almost mathieu cocyle _ ( [ eq : defa ] ) is homotopic to the identity .",
    "let @xmath72 be the set of unit vectors of @xmath73 and let us denote by @xmath74 the projection given by the exponential @xmath75 , identifying @xmath73 with @xmath76 .",
    "because of the linear character of the cocyle , the continuous map @xmath77 is also homotopic to the identity",
    ". therefore , it admits a continuous lift @xmath78 of the form : @xmath79 such that @xmath80 for all @xmath81 and @xmath71 .",
    "the map @xmath82 is independent of the choice of @xmath83 up to the addition of a constant @xmath84 , with @xmath85 .",
    "since the map @xmath86 is uniquely ergodic on @xmath87 for all @xmath88 , the limit @xmath89 exists , it is independent of @xmath90 and the convergence is uniform in @xmath90 , see herman @xcite and johnson & moser @xcite .",
    "this object is called the _ fibered rotation number _ , which will be denoted as @xmath91 , and it is defined modulus @xmath68 .    for instance , if @xmath92 is a constant matrix , then the rotation number of the cocycle @xmath93 , for any irrational @xmath3 , is the absolute value of the argument of the eigenvalues divided by @xmath94 .    using a suspension argument",
    "( see johnson @xcite ) it can be seen that , for the almost mathieu cocycle ( like for any quasi - periodic schrdinger cocycle ) , the fibered rotation number coincides with the _ sturmian _ definition given in the introduction . note that this last rotation number , @xmath95 , belongs to the interval , whereas the fibered rotation number , @xmath96 , is an element of @xmath97 .",
    "they can be both linked by means of the _ integrated density of states _",
    ", see avron & simon @xcite .",
    "let @xmath98 be @xmath99 times the number of eigenvalues less than or equal to @xmath100 for the restriction of @xmath27 to the set @xmath101 , for some @xmath102 , with zero boundary conditions at both ends @xmath103 and @xmath104 . then ,",
    "as @xmath105 , the @xmath106 converge to a continuous function @xmath107 , which is the integrated density of states .",
    "the basic relations are @xmath108 for a suitable integer @xmath109 .",
    "in particular , @xmath110    in what follows , the arithmetic nature of the rotation number will be of importance .",
    "we will say that the rotation number is _ rational or resonant _ with respect to @xmath3 if there exists a constant @xmath111 such that @xmath112 or equivalently , @xmath113 modulus @xmath114 .",
    "also , we say that it is _ diophantine _ with respect to @xmath3 whenever the bound @xmath115 holds for all @xmath116 and suitable fixed positive constants @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "a main tool in the study of quasi - periodic skew - product flows is its _ reducibility _ to constant coefficients .",
    "reducibility is a concept defined for the continuous and discrete case ( for an introduction see the reviews by eliasson @xcite , @xcite and , for more references , the survey @xcite by the author ) .",
    "a quasi - periodic skew - product flow like ( [ eq : skewgeneral ] ) , or a quasi - periodic cocycle like ( [ eq : cocycle ] ) , with @xmath119 , is said to be _ reducible to constant coefficients _ if there is a continuous map @xmath120 and a constant matrix @xmath121 , called the floquet matrix , such that the conjugation @xmath122 is satisfied for all @xmath123 when @xmath3 is rational , in which case the flow is periodic , any skew - product flow is reducible to constant coefficients . even in this periodic case , it is not always possible to reduce with the same frequency @xmath3 , but with @xmath124 .",
    "if there is a reduction to constant coefficients like ( [ eq : conjugation ] ) , then a fundamental matrix of solutions of ( [ eq : skewgeneral ] ) , @xmath125 with @xmath126 continuous , has the following _ floquet representation _ : @xmath127 for all @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "this gives a complete description of the qualitative behaviour of the flow ( [ eq : skewgeneral ] ) .",
    "the rotation number of a quasi - periodic cocycle is not invariant through a conjugation like ( [ eq : conjugation ] ) .",
    "there are however the following easy relations :    let @xmath3 be an irrational number and @xmath130 and @xmath131 be two quasi - periodic cocycles on @xmath132 homotopic to the identity , being @xmath133 and @xmath134 the corresponding fibered rotation numbers .",
    "assume that there exists a continuous map @xmath135 such that @xmath136 for all @xmath71 .",
    "then , if @xmath111 is the degree of @xmath137 , @xmath138    this proposition shows that , for any fixed irrational frequency @xmath3 , the class of quasi - periodic cocycles with rational rotation number ( resp .",
    "with diophantine rotation number ) is invariant under conjugation , although the rotation number itself may change .",
    "also , that whenever a quasi - periodic skew - product flow in @xmath56 is reducible to a floquet matrix with trace @xmath139 , the rotation number must be rational .      to end this section ,",
    "let us present a specific feature of the almost mathieu operator or , rather , of the associated eigenvalue equation which will in the basis of our arguments .",
    "it is part of what is known as _ aubry duality _ or simply _ duality _ :    [ res : dualrot ] for every irrational @xmath3 , the rotation number of ( [ eq : almosteq ] ) satisfies the relation @xmath140 for all @xmath49 and @xmath13 .    according to proposition [ res : propietats ]",
    "this means that the spectrum @xmath141 , for @xmath142 is just a dilatation of the spectrum @xmath9 .",
    "in particular , @xmath9 is a cantor set ( resp .",
    "none of the spectral gaps of @xmath9 is collapsed ) if , and only if @xmath141 is a cantor set ( resp .",
    "none of the spectral gaps of @xmath141 is collapsed ) .    in the proof of our two main results",
    "we will use the following argument , which is analogous to ince s argument for the classical mathieu periodic differential equation ( see @xcite  7.41 ) . in principle , the eigenvalue equation of a general quasi - periodic schrdinger operator may have two linearly independent quasi - periodic solutions with frequency @xmath3 ( or @xmath124 ) .",
    "one may call this phenomenon _ coexistence _ of quasi - periodic solutions , in analogy with the classical floquet theory for second - order periodic differential equations . a trivial example of",
    "this occurs in the almost mathieu case for @xmath10 and suitable values of @xmath100 .",
    "let us now show that in the almost mathieu case this does not happen if @xmath49 , i.e. two quasi - periodic solutions with frequency @xmath3 of the eigenvalue equation can not coexist . let @xmath143 satisfy the equation @xmath144 for some @xmath100 , @xmath142 and @xmath8 .",
    "if it is quasi - periodic with frequency @xmath3 , there exists a continuous function @xmath145 such that @xmath146 for all @xmath147 .",
    "the fourier coefficients of @xmath148 , @xmath149 satisfy the following equation : @xmath150 which is equivalent to @xmath151    since @xmath148 is at least continuous , then @xmath152 belongs to @xmath153 .",
    "now the reason for the absence of coexisting quasi - periodic solutions is clear . indeed ,",
    "if if @xmath154 is another linearly independent quasi - periodic solution of ( [ eq : almostintro ] ) with frequency @xmath3 , say @xmath155 , for some continuous @xmath156 , then the sequence of the fourier coefficients of @xmath156 , @xmath157 , would be a solution of ( [ eq : almosteqdual ] ) belonging to @xmath153 .",
    "the sequences @xmath152 and @xmath158 would be two linearly independent solutions of ( [ eq : almosteqdual ] ) which belong both to @xmath153 .    this is a contradiction , because for bounded potentials , like the cosine , we are always in the limit - point case ( see @xcite for the continuous case ) . in our discrete case , this is even simpler , since any solution in @xmath1 of the eigenvalue equation must tend to zero at @xmath159 .",
    "hence , the existence of two linearly independent solutions belonging both to @xmath1 would be in contradiction with the preservation of the wronskian .",
    "therefore , two quasi - periodic solutions with frequency @xmath3 can not coexist if @xmath142 .",
    "a similar argument shows that quasi - periodic solutions of the form @xmath160 for a continuous @xmath161 can not coexist .    finally , note that the coexistence of two quasi - periodic solutions with frequency @xmath3 of equation ( [ eq : almostintro ] ) is equivalent to the reducibility of the corresponding two - dimensional skew - product flow ( [ eq : skewgeneral ] ) , with the identity as floquet matrix .",
    "similarly the coexistence of two quasi - periodic solutions of the type ( [ eq : antiperiodic ] ) is equivalent to the reducibility of the flow with minus the identity as floquet matrix .",
    "in this section we will show that for @xmath45 , where @xmath162 is a suitable constant , and for @xmath163 all spectral gaps are open .",
    "the theorem from which we will derive corollary [ res : fort ] is due to eliasson and it was originally stated for the continuous case , based on a kam scheme .",
    "it can be adapted to the discrete case to obtain the following :    [ res : eliasson ] assume that @xmath3 is diophantine with constants @xmath14 and @xmath164 .",
    "then there is a constant @xmath165 such that , if @xmath166 and @xmath26 is either rational or diophantine , then the quasi - periodic skew - product flow @xmath167 on @xmath168 is reducible to constant coefficients , with floquet matrix @xmath169 , by means of a quasi - periodic ( with frequency @xmath124 ) and analytic transformation .",
    "moreover , if @xmath100 is at an endpoint of a spectral gap of @xmath9 , then the trace of @xmath169 is @xmath139 , being @xmath170 if , and only if , the gap collapses .",
    "finally , if @xmath171 then the transformation @xmath137 can be chosen to have frequency @xmath3 .    for other reducibility results in the context of quasi - periodic schrdinger operators see dinaburg & sinai @xcite and moser & pschel @xcite for the continuous case and krikorian @xcite and avila & krikorian @xcite for the discrete case .    taking into account the arguments from the previous section , corollary [ res : fort ]",
    "is immediate .",
    "indeed , let @xmath172 , where @xmath173 is the constant given by the theorem for a fixed diophantine frequency @xmath3 .",
    "then the skew - product flow ( [ eq : skew ] ) is reducible to constant coefficients and the floquet matrix has trace @xmath139 if @xmath100 is an endpoint of a spectral gap .",
    "moreover the gap is collapsed if , and only if , the floquet matrix @xmath169 is @xmath174 . since we have seen in the previous section that ( [ eq : skew ] ) for @xmath175 can not be reducible to these floquet matrices , corollary [ res : fort ] follows .",
    "in this section we will see how corollary [ res : debil ] is a consequence of the following theorem on non - perturbative localization , due to jitomirskaya :    [ res : jito ] let @xmath3 be diophantine .",
    "define the set @xmath176 of _ resonant phases _ as the set of those @xmath129 such that the relation @xmath177 holds for infinitely many values of @xmath178 , being @xmath164 the constant in the definition of a diophantine number . then , if @xmath179 and @xmath180 the operator @xmath27 has only pure point spectrum with exponentially decaying eigenfunctions .",
