    "we consider the system of partial differential equations @xmath0 which describes shear motions of a viscoplastic material and in terms of classification belongs to the class of hyperbolic - parabolic systems . here",
    ", @xmath1 is the plastic strain , @xmath2 is the velocity in the shearing direction , and @xmath3 are material parameters .",
    "the system is a model from viscoplasticity that serves as a simplified model to understand the problem of shear band formation in metals deformed at high strain rates ( see section [ sec2 ] ) .",
    "the yield relation @xmath4 characterizes the viscoplastic nature of materials : @xmath5 accounts for plastic ( net ) strain softening and @xmath6 for strain - rate hardening . the latter term models dissipation by momentum diffusion manifested by mathematical viscosity in the form present in non - newtonian fluids .    for @xmath7 , the system is elliptic in the @xmath8-direction and exhibits _ hadamard instability _ - the catastrophic growth of oscillations for the linearized initial value problem - induced by the ( net ) strain - softening response .",
    "but when @xmath9 , the viscosity competes against this ill - posedness . the combination of the destabilizing effect of strain softening and the stabilizing effect of strain - rate hardening is conjectured to lead to localization of the strain in narrow zones called shear bands @xcite .",
    "their formation is helpful for explaining mechanisms of material failure ; we refer to @xcite and to section [ sec2 ] for further details on this problem .    to set the localization problem in the language of mathematical analysis , observe that admits a class of solutions , that are valid for any values of the parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 and describe uniform shearing @xmath12 the issue then becomes to examine whether small perturbations of the uniform shearing solutions develop nonuniformities that go astray or whether nonuniformities get suppressed resulting into stable response . in the regime @xmath13 ,",
    "both linearized and nonlinear analyses @xcite indicate that the uniform shearing solutions are stable . on the complementary region @xmath14 , an analysis of the linearized system of relative perturbations @xcite indicates instability of the uniform shearing solutions .    in this work , we aim to reveal the subtle mechanism of shear band formation in the nonlinear regime and to construct a class of self - similar solutions that exhibit localization in the regime @xmath14 .",
    "we exploit the invariance properties of the system and seek self - similar solutions of the form @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the similarity variable and @xmath17 is a parameter .",
    "the reader should note that the usual form of self - similar solutions for parabolic problems are generated for values of the parameter @xmath18 and capture the spreading effect associated with parabolic behavior .",
    "by contrast , we insist here on @xmath17 and study the existence of solutions focusing around the line @xmath19 as time proceeds .",
    "this idea for constructing localizing solutions is proposed in @xcite for a non - newtonian fluid with temperature - dependent viscosity and in @xcite for with @xmath20 .",
    "the parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 are selected by @xmath23 and the profiles @xmath24 are constructed by solving an initial value problem for a singular system of ordinary differential equations @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are positive parameters .",
    "there is no sufficiently general theory that guarantees the existence of solutions for such singular initial value problems and the construction is usually based on a case - by - case analysis . remarkably , the invariance properties of the system allows the de - singularization of the system ( see and ) .",
    "furthermore , a nonlinear change of variables ( see ) leads to reformulating the problem into an autonomous system of three first - order equations @xmath28 moreover , the question of existence of a solution @xmath29 to , is reformulated to that of the construction of a suitable heteroclinic orbit to .",
    "the difficulty with the construction of such heteroclinics originates from the dimensionality of the system . in @xcite",
    ", we considered a system related to the case @xmath20 and numerically constructed the heteroclinic orbit .",
    "the main result of this work is that by exploiting the geometric theory of nonlinear perturbations , one may construct the heteroclinic orbit .",
    "as @xmath11 is a small parameter , the system admits both fast and slow time scales . problems with multiple time scales are habitually found in multiple contexts , and one gets a clear picture of the problem by analyzing the geometric picture in the phase space via the geometric singular perturbation theory @xcite . among many successful applications of the theory ,",
    "there are several examples @xcite of application to the resolution of viscous wave fans in hyperbolic conservation laws .",
    "we present a novel application of the method to analyze the nonlinear competition of hadamard instability with viscosity effected by strain - rate hardening in dynamic plasticity .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we briefly explain the background and describe the mechanical problem studied in this paper . in section 3 ,",
    "a class of focusing self - similar solutions are introduced and the associated system of singular ordinary differential equations is derived .",
    "the problem is then reduced into the construction of a heteroclinic orbit of an associated autonomous system . in section 4 , the phase space analysis is carried out for this autonomous system .",
    "we identify its equilibria , study their dynamical nature and use mechanical deliberations to select the targeted heteroclinic orbit . in section 5",
    ", we construct a normally hyparbolic invariant manifold using the geometric singular perturbation theory ( reviewed in the appendix ) and study the dynamical system restricted on that manifold to establich the existence of the heteroclinic orbit .",
    "the emerging two - parameter family of localizing solutions to the system is outlined in section 6 ( see ) , where various properties , such as the range of parameters and growth behavior of the solution are precised .",
    "we investigate the formation of shear bands during the high - strain - rate shear deformation of metals . at high strain rate",
    ", shear can accumulate in narrow zones , often leading to rupture .",
    "several works have focused on this behavior to explain material failure @xcite . in experimental investigations of deformations of steels at high strain - rates , observations of shear bands",
    "are typically associated with strain softening response  past a critical strain  of the measured stress - strain curve @xcite .",
    "it was proposed by zener and hollomon @xcite , and further precised by clifton et al @xcite , that the effect of the deformation speed is twofold : an increase in the deformation speed changes the deformation conditions from isothermal to nearly adiabatic , and the combined effect of thermal softening and strain hardening of metals may produce a net softening response . on the other hand , strain - rate hardening has an effect _ per se _ , inducing momentum diffusion and playing a stabilizing role .    modeling this mechanism requires to consider the effect of the energy equation .",
    "nevertheless , a simper model has been proposed in order to assess the effect of ( net ) strain softening response in shear motions of a viscoplastic model to provide quantitative analysis in the problem of localization @xcite .",
    "the system @xmath30 models shear motions of a viscoplastic material exhibiting strain softening and strain - rate hardening @xmath31 respectively .",
    "consists of momentum conservation and kinematic compatibility , where @xmath2 is the velocity in the shearing direction , @xmath1 is the plastic shear strain , and @xmath32 is the shear stress .",
    "the model describes a specimen situated on the @xmath33-plane that shears in the @xmath34-direction .",
    "the simplifying assumption here is that the ( plastic ) strain @xmath1 and the strain rate @xmath35 solely characterize the stress yield relation @xmath36 .",
    "the purpose of our study is to analyze a type of instability emerging out of the competition between strain softening and strain - rate hardening .",
    "our study is not limited to capturing the shear bands but also seeks to explain this viscoplastic instability mechanism and the emergence of organized structures out of this competition .",
    "early mathematical treatments of the initial value problem can be found in @xcite .    a simple choice for @xmath37 is given by @xmath38 ( see @xcite ) where @xmath39 and @xmath9 is the rate sensitivity parameter which is typically very small @xcite .",
    "when @xmath7 , then @xmath40 and the condition of strain - softening @xmath39 implies that the system is elliptic in the @xmath8-direction .",
    "then the initial value problem exhibits hadamard instability , that is the linearized problem exhibits catastrophic growth in the high frequency oscillatory modes .",
    "but when @xmath41 , the effect of viscosity competes against this instability .    the model - admits the uniform shearing solutions , @xmath42 valid even for the value @xmath7 .",
    "the question arises which of the two effects , the instability induced by strain softening or the stabilizing effect of strain - rate sensitivity , wins the competition , and whether a given initial nonuniformity can lead to unstable modes that grow faster than the uniform shear .",
    "this question has been considered for a power law model , @xmath43 in @xcite .",
    "the associated system of partial differential equations becomes @xmath44 where @xmath41 and @xmath45 .",
    "the stability of the uniform shearing solutions for this system , under velocity boundary conditions , is considered in @xcite via methods of nonlinear analysis , and in @xcite via linearized analysis techniques . in the region",
    "@xmath46 , the uniform shear is both linearized and nonlinearly stable .",
    "by contrast , linearized instability appears in the region @xmath47 . throughout the rest of this work , we are interested in the instability regime ; hence , we focus on the parameter range @xmath48 , @xmath41 small , and study the behavior in the nonlinear regime .",
    "in this section , we study a family of focusing self - similar solutions for in the parameter regime @xmath49 .",
    "similar techniques were introduced in @xcite , where the authors studied a thermally softening model , and in the companion paper @xcite providing a numerical construction valid in the special case @xmath20 .",
    "we begin by investigating the scale invariance properties of the system . for a given @xmath50 , we define @xmath51 , @xmath52 and the new independent variables @xmath34 and @xmath53 such that @xmath54 due to the choice @xmath55 , this transformation makes the profile narrower and higher for @xmath56 large .",
    "this is of course in accordance with our goal , constructing solutions that localize the initial profile .",
    "a simple calculation shows that is invariant under if the exponents @xmath21 and @xmath22 are selected as @xmath57    this motivates us to consider a family of self - similar solutions of the focusing type @xmath58 with @xmath16 is the similarity variable .",
    "substitution into gives a system of ordinary differential equations @xmath59 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 are given by .",
    "we supplement the above equations with suitable initial conditions @xmath60 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are positive parameters . as the problem is singular",
    "it is not a - priori clear how many conditions are needed ; the choice is justified by the analysis of the singularity at @xmath61 presented below . given a smooth solution of , for parameters @xmath62 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , it will generate the profile of a solution to that localizes at the focusing rate @xmath62 .",
    "note that such a solution will be generated by an initial profile @xmath63 at @xmath64 and @xmath26 , @xmath27 can be thought as measuring the size of the initial nonuniformity .",
    "the system is non - autonomous and singular at @xmath65 .",
    "existence of smooth solutions for such singular systems is not guaranteed by general theories and is effected via a case - by - case analysis . in the present case , it is possible to de - singularize , turning it into an autonomous system of three differential equations . in a second step",
    "the problem is turned into the construction of a heteroclinic orbit for an equivalent system .",
    "the existence of the heteroclinic orbit is achieved in section [ sec : proof ] by employing the geometric singular perturbation theory .",
    "we begin the de - singularization by reducing the problem on the right half plane @xmath66 .",
    "the symmetry of the system under @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 allows us to look for @xmath70 that is even and @xmath71 that is odd .",
    "then , the regularity conditions at @xmath65 @xmath72 are imposed to ensure @xmath70 and @xmath71 are smooth at @xmath65 .",
    "the system has its own scale invariance . for a given @xmath73",
    ", we define @xmath74 the exponents @xmath75 and @xmath76 that make invariant are @xmath77    motivated by the previous observation , we introduce a change of variables @xmath78 where @xmath79 , @xmath80 is the new independent variable .",
    "substitution into gives the system for the residual variables @xmath81",
    "@xmath82 the third equation can be written as @xmath83 when @xmath9 .",
    "after rearrangement , we arrive at an autonomous system of three first - order equations @xmath84    further inspection shows that the variables can not simultaneously equilibrate . for example , if @xmath85 as @xmath86 , then @xmath87 and this makes @xmath88 diverge .",
    "this raises analytical difficulties addressed and we avoid them by introducing a second non - linear transformation so that the variables simultaneously equilibrate .",
    "one observation is that if @xmath89 as @xmath90 ( resp . as @xmath91 ) , then @xmath92 as @xmath90 ( resp . as @xmath91 ) .",
    "thus , if we identify two quantities @xmath93 and @xmath94 that share the same asymptotic leading order as @xmath90 ( resp . as @xmath91 ) , then @xmath95 , in other words @xmath96 equilibrates as @xmath90 ( resp . as @xmath91 ) . using , heuristic calculations can be carried out to find which three pairs of quantities are expected to share the same asymptotic leading order .",
    "this suggests to introduce the variables @xmath97 substitution into leads to the equivalent system @xmath98 where @xmath99 .",
    "the remainder of the work is organized as follows :    * in section [ sec : dyn ] , we show that the problem of existence of a smooth profile @xmath100 satisfying and can be reformulated to the construction of a suitable heteroclinic orbit for the system . * in section [ sec :",
    "proof ] , we use the geometric theory of singular perturbations ( see appendix [ sec : geom ] ) to construct the heteroclinic orbit .    it is instructive to examine the relation between the uniform shearing solutions ( where for simlicity @xmath101 ) and the focusing self - similar solutions .",

    "the function @xmath105 , @xmath106 solves and the associated function emerging from , @xmath107 is precisely the uniform shearing solution .",
    "it corresponds however to a choice of parameter @xmath18 and it is not of the focusing type .",
    "in this section , we carry out the following steps :    1 .   in section [ sec : equi ] , we find the equilibria @xmath108 , @xmath109 , of and compute their local eigenstructure .",
    "2 .   in section [ sec : char ] , we single out a heteroclinic orbit having the expected behavior as @xmath110 .",
    "the system has four equilibrium points in the first octant of the phase space .",
    "the four equilibrium points are @xmath111 where @xmath21 is the exponent in and @xmath112 figure [ fig : equilibria0 ] is depicting the four equilibrium points in the first octant ] the constants @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and @xmath115 diverge as @xmath116 . ] .",
    "annotated arrows are pointing the stable and unstable subspaces of each equilibrium point .    when @xmath117 , @xmath118 becomes negative and @xmath119 lies below the plane @xmath120 .",
    "we will only be interested in the cases where @xmath119 lies above the plane @xmath120 and only in the region @xmath121 .",
    "thus , the case @xmath122 is excluded from our study and accordingly @xmath62 has the upper bound @xmath123 next , when @xmath124 , @xmath125 is replaced by a line of equilibria which is the @xmath126-axis . because it takes place on the plane @xmath120 ,",
    "this case is not treated separately .",
    "now , we present the linear stability analysis of the equilibria .",
    "we denote the three eigenvalues of the linearization at each @xmath127 by @xmath128 and the associated eigenvectors by @xmath129 , @xmath130 . the eigenvalues and eigenvectors as well as",

    "since there are four equilibria , the unstable or stable manifolds of each equilibrium point may conceivably intersect in various ways and produce multiple heteroclinic connections .",
    "our goal is to identify a heteroclinic connection that provides a meaningful ( from the perspective of mechanics ) self - similar solution .",
    "its characterization comes from analyzing the expected behavior as @xmath147 .",
    "the profile of the targeted solution should correspond mechanical loading in the shearing direction , and the resulting strain should be an increasing function of time at any spatial point .",
