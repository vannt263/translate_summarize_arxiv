    "open quantum systems take into account the effect of the environment ( reservoir or bath ) on the dynamical evolution of the system of interest thereby providing a natural route for discussing damping and dephasing .",
    "one of the first testing grounds for open system ideas was in quantum optics @xcite .",
    "its application to other areas gained momentum from the works of caldeira and leggett @xcite , and zurek @xcite , among others .",
    "the total hamiltonian is @xmath0 , where @xmath1 stands for the system , @xmath2 for the reservoir and @xmath3 for the system - reservoir interaction .",
    "depending upon the system - reservoir ( @xmath4 ) interaction , open systems can be broadly classified into two categories , viz . , quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) or dissipative .",
    "a particular type of quantum nondemolition ( qnd ) @xmath4 interaction is given by a class of energy - preserving measurements in which dephasing occurs without damping the system , i.e. , where @xmath5   = 0 $ ] while the dissipative systems correspond to the case where @xmath6   \\neq   0 $ ] resulting in decoherence along with dissipation @xcite .",
    "a prototype of dissipative open quantum systems , having many applications , is the quantum brownian motion of harmonic oscillators .",
    "this model was studied by caldeira and leggett @xcite for the case where the system and its environment were initially separable .",
    "the above treatment of the quantum brownian motion was generalized to the physically reasonable initial condition of a mixed state of the system and its environment by hakim and ambegaokar @xcite , smith and caldeira @xcite , grabert , schramm and ingold @xcite , and for the case of a system in a stern - gerlach potential @xcite , and also for the quantum brownian motion with nonlinear system - environment couplings @xcite , among others .",
    "the interest in the relevance of open system ideas to quantum information has increased in recent times because of the impressive progress made on the experimental front in the manipulation of quantum states of matter towards quantum information processing and quantum communication .",
    "_ @xcite and turchette _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have performed a series of experiments in which they induced decoherence and decay by coupling the atom ( their system-@xmath1 ) to engineered reservoirs , in which the coupling to , and the state of , the environment are controllable .",
    "quantum entanglement is the inherent property of a system to exhibit correlations , the physical basis being the non - local nature of quantum mechanics @xcite , and hence is a property that is exclusively quantum in nature .",
    "entanglement plays a central role in quantum information theory @xcite as in interesting non - classical applications such as quantum computation @xcite and quantum error correction @xcite .",
    "a number of methods have been proposed for creating entanglement involving trapped atoms @xcite .",
    "an important issue is to study how quantum entanglement is affected by noise , which can be thought of as a manifestation of an open system effect @xcite . in @xcite entanglement of a two - mode squeezed state in a phase - sensitive gaussian environment",
    "was studied and the criteria for the necessary and sufficient condition for separability of gaussian continuous - variable states @xcite was employed as a measure of entanglement . in @xcite",
    "the entanglement between charge qubits induced by a common dissipative environment was analyzed using concurrence as the measure .",
    "some recent experimental investigations on the influence of decoherence on the dynamics of entanglement have been made in @xcite . in a related work @xcite ,",
    "this issue was taken up with the noise coming from the effect of the environment modelled by a qnd @xmath4 interaction . here",
    "we complement this program by studying the effect of noise , modelled by a dissipative @xmath4 interaction with the reservoir in an initial squeezed - thermal state @xcite , on the entanglement evolution between two spatially separated ( and initially uncorrelated ) qubits , brought out by interaction with the bath .",
    "this would be of relevance to evaluate the performance of two - qubit gates in practical quantum information processing systems .",
    "since we are dealing here with a two qubit system which very rapidly evolves into a mixed state , a study of entanglement would necessarily involve a measure of entanglement for mixed states .",
    "entanglement of a bipartite system in a pure state is unambigious and well defined .",
    "however , mixed state entanglement ( mse ) is not so well defined .",
    "thus , although a number of criteria such as entanglement of formation @xcite and separability @xcite exist , there is a realization @xcite that a single quantity is inadequate to describe mse .",
    "this was the principal motivation for the development of a new prescription of mse @xcite in which it is characterized not as a function , but as a probability density function ( pdf ) .",
    "the known prescriptions such as concurrence and negativity emerge as particular parameters that characterize the probability density .",
    "we will principally make use of this measure in our study of entanglement in the two - qubit system .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we recapitulate for consistency , the recently developed entanglement measure of mse @xcite . in section iii ,",
    "the master equation describing the dynamical evolution of the two - qubit system interacting with a squeezed thermal bath , via a dissipative @xmath4 interaction , is given which is then used in section iv , to study in detail the dynamics of the system interacting with a vacuum bath with zero bath squeezing in section iv(a ) and with a general squeezed thermal bath in section iv(b ) .",
    "section v deals with the entanglement analysis of the two - qubit open system using the pdf as a measure of entanglement . we compare it with the usual measure of mse , concurrence .",
    "we dwell on the scenarios where the two qubits effectively interact via localized @xmath4 interactions , called the independent decoherence model , as also when they interact collectively with the bath , called the collective decoherence model . in section",
    "vi , we make a brief application of the model to practical quantum communication , in the form of a quantum repeater @xcite . in section vii",
    ", we make our conclusions .",
    "here we briefly recapitulate the characterization of mixed state entanglement ( mse ) through a pdf as developed in @xcite .",
    "as pointed out in the introduction , the above criterion was evolved from the motivation that for the characterization of mse , a single parameter is inadequate .",
    "the basic idea is to express the pdf of entanglement of a given system density matrix ( in this case , a two - qubit ) in terms of a weighted sum over the pdf s of projection operators spanning the full hilbert space of the system density matrix .",
    "the pdf of a system in a state which is a projection operator @xmath7 of rank @xmath8 is defined as : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the volume measure for @xmath11 , which is the subspace spanned by @xmath12 .",
    "the volume measure is determined by the invariant haar measure associated with the group of automorphisms of @xmath10 , modulo the stabilizer group of the reference state generating @xmath13 .",
    "thus for a one dimensional projection operator , representing a pure state , the group of automorphisms consists of only the identity element and the pdf is simply given by the dirac delta .",
    "indeed , if @xmath14 , the pdf has the form @xmath15 thereby resulting in the description of pure state entanglement , as expected , by a single number .",
    "the entanglement density of a system in a general mixed state @xmath16 is given by resolving it in terms of nested projection operators with appropriate weights as @xmath17 where the projections are @xmath18 , with @xmath19 and the eigenvalues @xmath20 , i.e. , the eigenvalues are arranged in a non - increasing fashion .",
    "thus the pdf for the entanglement of @xmath16 is given by @xmath21 where the weights of the respective projections @xmath22 are given by @xmath23 .",
    "for a two qubit system , the density matrix would be represented as a nested sum over four projection operators , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 corresponding to one , two , three and four dimensional projections , respectively , with @xmath24 corresponding to a pure state and @xmath27 corresponding to a a uniformly mixed state , is a multiple of the identity operator .",
    "the most interesting structure is present in @xmath25 , the two - dimensional projection , which is characterized by three parameters , viz .",
    "@xmath28 , the entanglement at which the pdf diverges , @xmath29 , the maximum entanglement allowed and @xmath30 , the pdf corresponding to @xmath31 .",
    "the three dimensional projection @xmath26 is characterized by the parameter @xmath32 , which parametrizes a discontunity in the entanglement density function curve . by virtue of the convexity of the sum over the nested projections ( [ nested ] )",
    ", it can be seen that the concurrence of any state @xmath16 is given by the inequality @xmath33 . thus while the concurrence for a three and four dimensional projection is identically zero , through the pdf one is able to make a statement about the entanglement content of these spaces . the fact that the pdf ( [ pdf ] ) enables us to study entanglement of a physical state by exploiting the richness inherent in the subspaces spanned by the system hilbert space makes it an attractive statistical and geometric characterization of entanglement , of which an explicit illustration is made in section v.",

    "since the contribution from the one dimensional projection is an indicator of pure state entanglement in the system , this clearly brings out the entanglement content in the system , under the given conditions , even though concurrence is zero .",

    "thus we see that when compared to the interaction with a bath at @xmath186 , the finite @xmath60 bath is detrimental to the generation of entanglement between the two - qubit system .",
    "an interesting connection of this can be made with the work presented in @xcite , where the authors connected frustration with interaction strength and ground - state entanglement .",
    "they defined frustration as the non - commutativity of the local hamiltonian ( consisting of the single body terms ) with the interaction hamiltonian and argued that with the increase in interaction , ground - state entanglement in the system would increase .",
    "the case of dissipative @xmath4 interaction with @xmath5    \\neq   0 $ ] would suggest a frustrated system in this nomenclature .",
    "for the interaction of the two - qubit system with a vacuum bath , entanglement is seen to rise with increase in the influence of the environment qualitatively agreeing with the above work .",
    "finally entanglement would vanish because as a result of decoherence , the system would lose its quantum coherence and tend towards the classical regime .",
    "the technique of entanglement purification @xcite can be adapted for quantum communication over long distances , the key idea behind a _ quantum repeater _",
    "the efficiency of quantum communication over long distances is reduced due to the effect of noise , which can be considered as a natural open system effect . for distances much longer than the coherence length of a noisy quantum channel , the fidelity of transmission is usually so low that standard purification methods are not applicable . in a quantum repeater set - up ,",
    "the channel is divided into shorter segments that are purified separately and then connected by the method of entanglement swapping .",
    "this method can be much more efficient than schemes based on quantum error correction , as it makes explicit use of two - way classical communication .",
    "the quantum repeater system allows entanglement purification over arbitrary long channels and tolerates errors on the percent level .",
    "it requires a polynomial overhead in time , and an overhead in local resources that grows only logarithmically with the length of the channel .",
    "we consider the effect of noise , introduced by imperfect local operations that constitute the protocols of entanglement swapping and purification , on such a compound channel , and how it can be kept below a certain threshold .",
    "the noise process studied is the one obtained from the two - qubit reduced dynamics via a dissipative system - reservoir interaction , studied above , instead of the depolarizing noise considered in @xcite . here",
    "we treat this problem in a simplified fashion , and study the applicability and efficiency of entanglement purification protocols in the situation of imperfect local operations .",
    "a treatment of partial teleportation of entanglement , conceptually equivalent to quantum entanglement swapping , in a noisy environment was made in @xcite .",
    "a quantum repeater involves the two tasks of entanglement swapping , involving bell - state measurements , and entanglement purification , involving cnot gates .",
    "the bell - state measurement may be equivalently replaced by a cnot followed by a projective single - qubit measurement . in entanglement swapping ,",
    "two distant parties initially not sharing entanglement with each other , but sharing entanglement separately with a third party , become entangled by virtue of a multi - partite measurement by the third party on the latter s two halves of entanglement .",
    "entanglement purification involves two parties employing local operations and classical communication ( locc ) to improve the fidelity @xmath187 of einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) pairs they share , with respect to a maximally entangled state .",
    "the local operations involve two - qubit gates such as the cnot operation , followed by single qubit measurement , and a possible discarding of an epr pair .",
    "provided @xmath188 , and at the cost of losing shared ( impure ) entanglement , the two parties can increase the fidelity of the remaining shared entanglement to @xmath189 ^ 2}{f^2 + [ 2f(1-f)/3 ] + ( 5/9)(1-f)^2 } , \\label{eq : bennett}\\ ] ] where @xmath187 and @xmath190 are , respectively , the input and output fidelities of the entanglement purification protocol proposed by bennett _",
    "_ @xcite .    in the simplified scenario considered here ,",
    "the output of the noisy cnot is taken to be a mixed separable state , in place of a pure separable state that is obtained in the noiseless case . as a further simplification , in order to faciliate an easy connection with the purification protocol due to bennett et al .",
    ", this mixed state is assumed to be of the form : @xmath191 where @xmath192 is a mixture in the two dimensional space spanned by @xmath193 , parametrized by fidelity @xmath187 , given by @xmath194 .",
    "the state @xmath195 is then the input to the purification protocol , whereby we obtain the output fidelity @xmath190 as a function of @xmath187 .",
    "we depict in figures ( [ fig : rep2qvacindep1collc ] ( a ) ) and ( b ) the modified ` purification loop ' , obtained by subjecting the noiseless loop to the above model of noise for the independent and collective decoherence regimes , respectively . in both figures",
    "we find that noise degrades the performance of the purification protocol . to evaluate its performance ,",
    "it may be compared with the noiseless case , given by the dot - dashed curve in both figures . that this curve lies above the @xmath196 line in the closed range @xmath197",
    "$ ] implies that fidelities above the minimum value @xmath198 can be corrected to the maximum value @xmath199 by repeated application of purification .",
    "the degrading effect of noise can be seen in two ways : it introduces an off - set , whereby an input of @xmath200 does not yield the same output ; it restricts @xmath201 to values less than 1 .    in figure ( [ fig : rep2qvacindep1collc ]",
    "( a ) ) , comparison of the small and large dashed curves shows that increasing bath exposure time degrades the fidelity by suppressing @xmath201 ( the point where a curve cuts the @xmath196 line from above ) and increasing the off - set at @xmath200 .",
    "although figure ( [ fig : rep2qvacindep1collc ] ( b ) ) similarly shows the expected off - set due to noise , the surprising feature is that the curves for @xmath202 and @xmath203 show a slight _ lowering _ of output fidelity with increasing input fidelity .",
    "the matter is compounded by noting that at an intermediate time ( @xmath204 ) , as depicted by the large - dash - dot curve , the function @xmath205 is monotonously _",
    "increasing_. this may be attributed to the fact that entanglement generated due to interaction with the bath shows a strong oscillatory behavior , as seen from figure ( [ fig : concutim ] ) for the collective regime .",
    "here we have analyzed the dynamics of entanglement in a two - qubit system interacting with its environment , taken to be in a general squeezed thermal state , via a dissipative @xmath4 interaction .",
    "the analysis of the mixed state entanglement has been made using a measure involving a probability density function ( pdf ) .",
    "the position dependent coupling of the qubits with the bath enabled a natural division of the dynamics into an independent and collective decoherence regime , where in the independent decoherence regime the qubits interact via localized @xmath4 interactions , while in the collective regime the qubits are close enough to feel the bath collectively .",
    "the reduced dynamics revealed that in this case of dissipative @xmath4 interaction , there is no decoherence - free subspace in contrast to that of a qnd @xmath4 interaction @xcite .",
    "this can be understood in the following manner . as shown in @xcite ,",
    "the two - qubit qnd reduced dynamics obeys the relation @xmath206 , with the non - trivial aspect of the dynamics being that @xmath207 represents , not a matrix , but a two - dimensional array , with the multiplication done element - wise .",
    "this gets translated into the spin - flip symmetry obeyed by the reduced dynamics .",
    "the emergence of a decoherence - free subspace could be attributed to the non - trivial symmetry obeyed by the system .",
    "an absence of a decoherence - free subspace in the present case of dissipative interaction could be due to the lack of such a symmetry in the reduced dynamics .",
    "we studied the entanglement in the two - qubit system for different bath parameters , for both vacuum as well as a bath at finite @xmath60 and squeezing and used the measure of mixed state entanglement involving a pdf as well as concurrence .",
    "it clearly emerged that entanglement generation is more efficient in the case of interaction with a bath at zero @xmath60 than at finite @xmath60 .",
    "it also appears that in this case of two - qubit dissipative @xmath4 interaction , presence of finite bath squeezing does not help in entanglement generation .",
    "this is in contrast to expectations from the single - qubit dissipative interaction @xcite where it was observed that for some bath parameters , the process of decoherence could be slowed down resulting in the preservation of quantum coherence for a longer time",
    ". it would be pertinent to point out here an interesting work @xcite where the authors studied in detail the evolution of entanglement between two oscillators coupled to the same environment .",
    "there the oscillator system was assumed to start from a general two - mode gaussian state , which includes the two - mode squeezed state .",
    "entanglement in the final state was considered as a resource whose origin could be the quantum resource available in the system , viz . squeezing in the initial oscillator system .",
    "it was shown that under certain regimes of the squeezing parameter , the environment could be used as a resource to extract entanglement , thereby highlighting the importance of squeezing in the study of entanglement generation .",
    "the work presented here differs from that in @xcite , apart from the obvious difference in the system ( here a two - qubit system ) , in that the evolution considered here is markovian while that in @xcite is that of quantum brownian motion which is essentially non - markovian .",
    "also , here the squeezing originated from the bath while that in @xcite was in the initial system state .",
    "it would be of interest to extend the work presented here to have a better understanding of the impact of squeezing , a natural resource , on the dynamic evolution of entanglement .",
    "the entanglement analysis via the pdf showed an advantage over concurrence , specially in the case of mixed state entanglement due to interaction with a finite @xmath60 bath . while concurrence was zero for most of the cases considered",
    ", the pdf revealed the structure of entanglement still present in the two - qubit system bringing out the statistical and geometrical nature of the measure .",
    "finally we made an application of the dissipative two - qubit reduced dynamics to a simplified model of a quantum repeater , which can be adapted for quantum communication over long distances .",
    "thus this work along with @xcite makes a detailed study of the dynamics of two - qubit entanglement in the presence of generic , purely dephasing as well as dissipative , open quantum system effects ."
