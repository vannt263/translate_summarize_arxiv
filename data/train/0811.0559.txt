    "the recent experimental observation of the josephson effect in a half - metallic junction between two superconducting reservoirs@xcite has renewed interest in superconductor  ferromagnet hybrid devices .",
    "the observation of a supercurrent in a half metal is remarkable , because cooper pairs in spin - singlet superconductors consist of a pair of electrons with opposite spin , whereas a half metal conducts electrons of one spin direction only.@xcite the resolution of this apparent paradox is the so - called `` triplet proximity effect '' , first predicted theoretically by bergeret , volkov , and efetov.@xcite ( see also ref .",
    ", as well as ref .   for a review .",
    ") the triplet proximity effect relies on the conversion of spin - singlet cooper pairs of electrons with opposite spin into pairs of electrons of equal spin at a spin - active interface between the superconductor and the half metal.@xcite since pairs of equal - spin electrons can be transmitted coherently through a half metal , the triplet proximity effect can indeed explain the observation of a josephson current in the experiment .",
    "most theoretical studies of the triplet proximity effect were done using the quasiclassical green s function method.@xcite this method is appropriate for systems in which transport takes place through many conducting channels.@xcite for systems with few channels only , the green s function technique should be applied without the quasiclassical approximation .",
    "this , albeit doable,@xcite can lead to calculations of significant complexity .",
    "another method that is particularly well suited for few channel structures is the scattering matrix approach .",
    "this method has been frequently used in the context of transport problems involving superconductors ( for a review , see ref .  ) .",
    "however , it has not yet been applied to the triplet proximity effect .",
    "it is the goal of the present article to fill this gap .    in the language of the scattering approach , the triplet proximity effect relies on the coherent andreev reflection of electron - like excitations into hole - like excitations with the same spin.@xcite conventional andreev reflection , as it takes place at the interface between a normal metal and a superconductor ,",
    "consists of the reflection of an electron into a hole with opposite spin .",
    "`` same spin '' and `` opposite spin '' here refers to the spin band from which the electron and hole are taken . since electron and hole from the same spin band",
    "have opposite angular momentum , conservation of angular momentum implies that electron and hole are from opposite spin bands .",
    "hence , andreev reflection of electrons into holes from the same spin band requires that the interface between the half metal and the superconductor is spin active .",
    "examples of appropriate spin active interfaces are a thin ferromagnetic or half - metallic layer with a polarization that is non - collinear with the half metal s polarization or a normal - metal spacer layer with strong spin - orbit scattering .",
    "our focus is on systems with the fewest number of channels possible , a single conducting channel at the fermi level .",
    "this limit can be achieved by having single channel contacts between the superconductor(s ) and the half metal . as an example of this limit",
    ", we use the scattering theory to address the simplest single channel half - metal  superconductor ( hs ) junction that can display triplet proximity effect : a single channel ferromagnetic or half - metallic ballistic point contact between h and s electrodes . to study a more complex situation",
    ", we investigate hs and superconductor  half - metal  superconductor ( shs ) junctions where the half metal is a chaotic quantum dot with single - channel point contacts .",
    "we also study the case of ballistic devices which have translation invariance along the interfaces .",
    "this situation allows for a single channel description as well , since the translation symmetry ensures that different transverse modes do not mix . while the latter system can in principle be addressed by the quasiclassical green s function method ,",
    "the former , physically single channel setups are fully quantum mechanical , hence falling outside of the scope of quasiclassics .",
    "we use the scattering matrix approach to calculate the differential conductance of an hs junction , and the ( zero - bias ) supercurrent in an shs junction .",
    "we find that there is a remarkable difference between these two observables in the single - channel limit .",
    "for a single - channel half - metal  superconductor junction at zero temperature , the linear conductance vanishes at the fermi level .",
    "the conductance becomes appreciable only if the applied voltage is comparable to the superconducting gap @xmath0 or to the thouless energy of the junction , whichever is smaller .",
    "the josephson current , on the other hand , proves to be nonzero at zero temperature .",
    "the origin of this different behavior is that the josephson effect contains information about the entire excitation spectrum of an shs junction , whereas the linear conductance is a property that requires knowledge of excitations at the fermi - level only .",

    "for a scattering description of the triplet proximity effect , we consider half - metal  superconductor ( hs ) junctions that consist of a half metal `` end '' , a spin - active intermediate layer , and a superconductor .",
    "the intermediate layer may be half - metallic , ferromagnetic , or normal metallic .",
    "the central object in the scattering approach is the scattering matrix @xmath1 of the hs junction .",
    "it relates the amplitudes of excitations at energy @xmath2 propagating towards the superconductor and excitations propagating away from the superconductor at the half - metal end of the junction , see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "if @xmath3 is below the superconducting gap @xmath0 , all excitations must be reflected at the interface with the superconductor .",
    "this reflection can be of normal type ( electron - like excitations are reflected as electrons , and hole - like excitations are reflected as holes ) , or of andreev type ( electron - like excitations are reflected as holes and vice versa ) .",
    "both reflection types are contained in the matrix @xmath4 , which is made explicit by the decomposition @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are matrices that describe normal reflection , whereas @xmath8 and @xmath9 describe andreev reflection .",

    "a necessary condition for the superconducting proximity effect is to have a nonvanishing @xmath33 . for an hs junction ,",
    "having a nonzero @xmath9 is not automatic : in the absence of spin - flip scattering in the intermediate layer , an electron coming from h is andreev reflected as a spin - down hole .",
    "this can not re - enter the half metallic contact ; it is reflected from the half metal instead , upon which it is andreev reflected once more to return as a spin - up electron .",

    "such anomalous andreev reflection , in which a spin - up electron coming from the half - metallic contact is reflected as a spin - up hole , is the key to the triplet proximity effect .",
    "examples of spin active layers that make this possible are a ferromagnet with a magnetization direction not collinear with the polarization of the half metal , a normal metal with strong spin - orbit coupling , or a half - metallic spacer layer with a different polarization direction and thin enough that there is nonzero transmission of minority electrons through evanescent modes .    in the next two sections we use the scattering theory to calculate the conductance of an hs junction and the josephson current in an shs junction .",
    "the scattering matrix @xmath1 obeys particle - hole symmetry , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the first pauli matrix acting in electron - hole space . for the special case @xmath36 , this symmetry , in combination with the condition that @xmath1 is unitary , leads to the condition that either @xmath37 or @xmath38 at the fermi level @xmath39 .",
