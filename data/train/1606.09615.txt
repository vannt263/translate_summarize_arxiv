    "we describe the first major data release ( hereafter the `` data release 1 '' ) of the largest single key - project in area carried out in open time with the _ herschel _ space observatory @xcite .",
    "the _ herschel _",
    "astrophysical terahertz large area survey ( the _ herschel_-atlas or h - atlas ) was allocated 600 hrs of observing time and is a survey of @xmath5 of sky in five photometric bands : 100 , 160 , 250 , 350 and 500@xmath1 m @xcite .",
    "the chief original goal of the survey was to provide a relatively shallow _ herschel _ survey over a very large area of sky , with the specific aims of providing measurements of the dust masses and dust - obscured star formation rate for tens of thousands of nearby galaxies @xcite , complementing the large optical spectroscopic surveys of the nearby universe , such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) and the galaxy and mass assembly project ( gama ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , the exceptional sensitivity of _ herschel _ , aided by the large and negative @xmath6correction at submillimeter wavelengths @xcite , has meant that a significant fraction of the sources in h - atlas actually lie at high redshift @xcite .",
    "the h - atlas survey is therefore useful both to astronomers studying the nearby universe and to those studying the early ( @xmath7 ) universe .",
    "the large area of the survey means that there are also potential uses for it in galactic astronomy @xcite , with one practical example being a search for debris disks around stars @xcite .",
    "we selected the h - atlas fields to avoid bright continuum emission from dust in the galaxy , as seen on the iras 100@xmath1 m image , which shows well the cool low surface brightness dust in the interstellar medium .",
    "we also chose the fields to provide the maximum amount of data in other wavebands . in the latter respect , a high priority was to choose fields that had already been surveyed in one of the major optical spectroscopic surveys of the nearby universe .",
    "we selected five fields : a large ( @xmath8deg@xmath0 ) field close to the north galactic pole , which was observed in the sdss ; a second large field ( @xmath9deg@xmath0 ) close to the south galactic pole , which was observed in the 2-degree - field galaxy redshift survey ( 2df ; @xcite ) ; and three fields on the celestial equator , which are each about 54deg@xmath0 in size , which were observed in the sdss , 2df and gama redshift surveys .",
    "the existence of the gama data is particularly important because this survey is much deeper than the sdss ( more than two magnitudes in the @xmath10 band ) , yielding a surface - density of galaxies with redshifts approximately four times greater .",
    "the positions of these latter equatorial fields are given in table  [ tab : gama ] .",
    "the fields are at right ascensions of approximately 9 hours , 12 hours and 15 hours and hereafter we will call these fields gama9 , gama12 and gama15 .    apart from the photometric data in the five h - atlas fields , there is a large amount of imaging data in many other wavebands .",
    "in particular , these fields have been imaged with the galaxy evolution explorer in the fuv and nuv filters ( galex ; @xcite ) and with the wide - field infrared survey explorer in the _",
    "w1 , w2 , w3 , w4 _ filters ( wise ; @xcite ) and as part of the uk infrared deep sky survey large area survey ( ukidss - las ; @xcite ) and the vista kilo - degree infrared galaxy survey in the _ z , y , j , h , @xmath11 _ filters ( viking ; @xcite ) and the vst kilo - degree survey in the _ u , g , r , i _ filters ( kids ; @xcite ) .",
    "this is the first of two papers describing the public release of the h - atlas data for the entire gama fields .",
    "we intend to release the data for the other fields over the following few months .",
    "the second paper describing the data release for the gama fields is @xcite ( hereafter ) which describes the properties of the optical counterparts of the h - atlas sources .",
    "we released part of the data for the gama9 field at the end of the _ herschel _ science demonstration phase ( hereafter sdp ) .",
    "this dataset was described by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the data we release now supersedes this earlier dataset .",
    "a comparison between the two datasets is described in   [ sect : sdpcomp ] .",
    "this paper describes the _ herschel _ images of the fields and the catalogues of sources that we have constructed based on the images .",
    "we have tried to describe the dataset in a way that is easily comprehensible to astronomers not expert in submillimetre data , referring those who are interested in some of the more technical details to other publications . nevertheless , there are some unavoidable technical issues that do need to be understood if the data are to be used in a reliable way .",
    "the most important of these is the importance of the noise in the images produced by the blending together of faint sources - so - called `` source confusion '' .",
    "one result of this is that there are two kinds of noise on submillimetre images : instrumental noise , which is usually uncorrelated between image pixels , and confusion noise which is highly correlated between pixels .",
    "one practical result of this is that the optimum filter for detecting unresolved sources differs from the point spread function of the telescope (   [ sect : mapfiltering ] ) , which is the optimum filter for maximising the signal - to - noise of unresolved sources if the noise is uncorrelated between pixels @xcite .",
    "a second technical issue is the statistical bias created by the effect of random errors if the distribution of the property being measured is not uniform .",
    "@xcite recognised this effect for the first time , showing that there was a significant bias in the measured number counts of stars even when the errors on the flux densities of the stars have the usual gaussian distribution .",
    "the cause of this bias is that there are more faint stars to be scattered to bright flux densities by errors than bright stars to be scattered to faint flux densities by errors , and thus any sample of stars in a narrow range of flux density will contain more stars whose true flux densities are lower than this range than stars whose true flux densities are brighter than this range .",
    "this effect is present in optical catalogues but is much more severe in submillimetre catalogues because of the steepness of the submillimetre source counts @xcite .",
    "this effect creates systematic errors in both the number counts , the phenomenon spotted by eddington , and also the flux densities of individual sources . in this paper",
    "we will refer to the first phenomenon as `` eddington bias '' and the second phenomenon as `` flux bias '' .",
    "the second effect is often called ` flux boosting ' , but we prefer our name because , in principle , the bias could be negative if there were fewer faint sources than bright sources .",
    "we have included in this paper extensive modelling of the effect of eddington and flux bias , as well as other simulations and modelling that will allow the astronomical community to use the h - atlas images and catalogues in a reliable way .",
    "describes the catalogue of the galaxies from the sdss r - band images that we have identified as the counterparts to the _ herschel _ sources and the multi - wavelength data for each of these galaxies .",
    "all of the data described in these two papers can be found on http://www.h-atlas.org .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows .",
    "section  [ sect : observations ] contains a description of the _ herschel _ observations .",
    "section  [ sect : spire ] describes the reduction and properties of the images made with one of the two cameras on _ herschel _ , the spectral and photometric imaging receiver ( spire ; @xcite ) .",
    "section  [ sect : pacs ] describes the data reduction and properties of the images made with _",
    "s other camera , the photoconductor array camera and spectrometer ( pacs ; @xcite ) .",
    "section  [ sect : phot ] describes the detection and photometry of the sources .",
    "section  [ sect : simulations ] describes the simulations we have carried out to investigate the effects of source confusion and instrumental noise on the catalogues .",
    "section  [ sect : counts250 ] describes our determination of the 250@xmath1 m source counts , corrected for the effect of eddington bias using the results of the simulations .",
    "section  [ sect : corrections ] describes our models of the completeness of the survey and of the flux bias of individual sources at 250 , 350 and 500@xmath1 m .",
    "section  [ sect : comparisons ] describes a comparison of our flux - density measurements with previous measurements at these wavelengths .",
    "section  [ sect : catalogue ] describes the catalogue of sources .",
    "the main results from the paper are summarised in section  [ sect : summary ] .    for those who wish to use the data as soon as possible without wading through a lengthy technical paper ,",
    "we have provided a quick start in the form of appendix a. in this appendix we describe the basic datasets we have released , with instructions and cautions on how to use them and references back to the full paper .",
    "appendix b provides a list of the asteroids detected in our maps , since these are not included in the catalogues of sources provided in the data release .",
    "the gama fields were observed with _",
    "herschel _ in parallel mode , with the two _ herschel _ instruments , pacs @xcite and spire @xcite , operating simultaneously .",
    "herschel _ survey of each gama field consists of four overlapping rectangular regions , strung along the celestial equator . with one exception ,",
    "each quadrant was observed twice by the telescope , each observation lasting about nine hours .",
    "the telescope scanned along great circles on the sky at a constant angular speed of @xmath12 , with the scan directions of the two observations being roughly orthogonal ( about @xmath13 apart ) . by making maps out of two datasets made with orthogonal scan directions ,",
    "it is possible , with the correct map - making algorithm , to correct for any large - scale artefacts that would result from the gradual changes in the response of the camera , which was a major concern before launch @xcite . in operation ,",
    "spire , although not pacs , proved sufficiently stable that only a very simple map - making algorithm was required and maps made from observations made with a single scan direction were usually free of artefacts from responsivity changes .",
    "the time delay between the two observations made it possible to look for variations in the submillimetre sky by comparing maps made from the two observations of each field .",
    "we used the differences of these maps to look for variable sources but only found asteroids ( see app .",
    "[ app : asteroids ] ) .",
    "we also used these maps for the astrometric registration of the data (   [ sect : dataproc ] ) .",
    "we have not included these maps in this data release ( maps made from the individual h - atlas observations can be found in the _ herschel _ archive ) .    during the observations , the telescope scans at a constant velocity along a great circle across the field . at the end of each `` scan leg '' , the telescope decelerates to rest , moves a constant distance orthogonal to the scan leg , and then scans backwards across the field .",
    "a single observation is then made up of a large number of scan legs during which the telescope is moving at a constant speed .",
    "data are still being taken during the sections between scan legs when the telescope is accelerating , but this `` turn - around '' data is not included in the final maps . in parallel mode , the scan lines were separated by @xmath14 in order to achieve a good coverage with both pacs and spire .",
    "more details can be found in the spire and pacs observers manuals , which are available at http://herschel.esac.esa.int .",
    "[ tab : gama ]    .fields coordinates and areas . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we found the asteroids by looking at the jackknife images , the images made by taking the difference of the two images of the same region made with the different scan directions (   [ sect : observations ] ) .",
    "the only sources on the jackknife images should be objects that either vary in flux density or move . in practice ,",
    "the only time - varying sources we found were asteroids .",
    "the list of source positions is given in table  [ tab : asteroids ] . in the table",
    "we also list the times and dates at which the sources were observed , which we determined by inspecting the time - line data for individual bolometers .",
    "we used these positions , times and dates to look for the asteroids corresponding to these sources , using the database of the minor planet center ( www.minorplanetcenter.net ) .",
    "an interesting complication in identifying the asteroids is that there are parallactic shifts of several arcmin corresponding to the change in vantage point from the earth to the location of _ herschel _ at the second lagrangian point . rather than calculating the precise parallactic shifts",
    ", we looked for any asteroids within 15arcmin of the source position at the appropriate time and date .",
    "there was always one asteroid that was several magnitudes brighter than the others at optical wavelengths , and this asteroid was usually but not always the closest to the position of the _ herschel _ source .",
    "based on the optical brightness and the positional offsets , we are confident that the asteroids we have listed in the table are the correct identifications , although we have provided enough information for anyone interested in calculating more precise geocentric positions in order to make the identification completely secure .",
    "the number in brackets in the name of the asteroid shows the historical order in which the asteroid was discovered .",
    "not surprisingly , the asteroids discovered in the first survey of a large area of sky at submillimetre wavelengths were also among the first to be discovered by optical astronomers ."
