    "the carbon - rich hydrogen - poor circumstellar envelopes , such as wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars and r coronae borealis stars , have also been proposed as favorable sites for the synthesis of fullerenes @xcite . however , none of these theoretical predictions have been confirmed observationally .",

    "another approach is to search for the infrared vibrational modes of the molecule @xcite .",
    "@xcite noted a faint feature at 17.85 and 18.90@xmath1 m in the _ iso_-sws spectrum of the proto - planetary nebula ( ppn ) iras 07134 + 1005 and suggested that they could correspond to the @xmath3 and @xmath4 vibrational modes of the c@xmath0 molecule .",
    "however , these features are not confirmed by subsequent _",
    "a search of these bands in the reflection nebula ngc 7023 with _",

    "only very recently , c@xmath0 was unambiguously detected in the planetary nebula ( pn ) tc  1 @xcite and the reflection nebulae ngc 7023 and ngc 2023 @xcite .",
    "this was followed by the detections of c@xmath0 in four more pns @xcite .",
    "these detections of c@xmath0 in objects at the late stages of stellar evolution raise the concrete question of how c@xmath0 is formed in circumstellar environment .",
    "since the element c is synthesized in asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars and many c - based molecules have been detected in the outflow of agb stars , it is reasonable to expect the c@xmath0 can also be one of the products of circumstellar molecular synthesis .",
    "laboratory results show that the formation efficiency of fullerenes depends on the content of hydrogen and this has led to the suggestion by @xcite that under hydrogen - poor environment , the formation of c@xmath0 is favored , and otherwise the chemical pathway favors the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) molecules .",
    "this scenario is supported by the fact that the infrared spectrum of tc  1 does not exhibit the aromatic infrared bands ( aibs ) commonly assigned to as arising from pah molecules . however , contrary to this scenario , c@xmath0 was detected in hydrogen - containing pns showing the aibs @xcite .",
    "the detection of c@xmath0 in ngc  7023 @xcite , an object with strong aib emissions , also confirms that c@xmath0 and the aib carriers can coexist . as an alternative explanation",
    ", @xcite suggested that both pah molecules and fullerenes are formed from the destruction of hydrogenated amorphous carbon ( hac ) , and the non - detection of aibs in tc 1 is due to the longer survival time of c@xmath0 molecules .",
    "a search for c@xmath0 in a large sample of r coronae borealis ( r cor bor ) stars was performed by @xcite .",
    "c@xmath0 is clearly detected in one of the r cor bor stars showing aibs , but c@xmath0 is absent in the most hydrogen - poor ones .",
    "these results further support the premise that fullerene and the carrier of the aibs can coexist .",
    "ppns are the descendants of the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars and the immediate precursors of pns @xcite .",
    "the changes of infrared spectroscopic properties in agb stars , ppns , and pns have been known as a consequence of evolution @xcite .",
    "thus ppns can provide a unique opportunity to investigate the formation history of c@xmath0 in circumstellar envelopes .",
    "we have obtained infrared spectra of a sample of ppns @xcite which cover the wavelengths of four c@xmath0 vibrational transitions at 7.0 ( @xmath5 ) , 8.5 ( @xmath6 ) , 17.4 ( @xmath3 ) , and 18.9@xmath1 m ( @xmath4 ) @xcite .",
    "these spectra therefore can serve as a platform to search for c@xmath0 in ppns .",
    "in this paper we report a new detection of c@xmath0 in a ppn , iras 01005 + 7910 .",
    "unlike the other sources in our sample , iras 01005 + 7910 does not show the 21-@xmath1 m feature and its central star has a higher temperature ( @xmath7k ) , suggesting that it a ppn about to enter the pn stage @xcite .",

    "these c@xmath0 features are not found in any other ppns in our sample .",
    "this suggests that these features likely share a common origin , and thus strengthens the identification of c@xmath0 as their carrier .",
    "the continuum was fitted using the feature - free spectral regions , and was subtracted from the observed spectrum . as the features in ppn spectra are usually broad and blended with each other , we conducted a spectral decomposition using the idl package pahfit developed by @xcite in order to accurately measure the feature fluxes .",
    "drude profiles are assumed for the aibs and c@xmath0 features .",
    "the actual profile of the 1520@xmath1 m plateau , where c@xmath0 17.4 and 18.9@xmath1 m features are superimposed , is poorly known .",
    "we have assumed two broad gaussian profiles having a width of 1.3@xmath1 m and peaked at 16.1 and 17.5@xmath1 m for the plateau ( this causes only slight uncertainty in the flux measurements since the c@xmath0 features are much narrower than the plateau ) . for the fitting , we have taken into account the aibs at 6.2 , 6.4 , 6.6 , 6.8 , 7.4 , 7.6 , 7.9 , 8.3 , 8.6 , and 16.5 @xmath1 m .",
    "figures  [ c60a ] and [ c60b ] give the zoomed - in view of these c@xmath0 features and the fitting results . from the fitting results , we derived fluxes of @xmath13w / m@xmath14 , @xmath15w / m@xmath14 , and @xmath16w / m@xmath14 for the c@xmath0 7.0 , 17.4 , and 18.9@xmath1 m features , respectively .",

    "@xcite found that the c@xmath0 @xmath17@xmath1 m transition in the spectrum of ngc 7023 is partially blended with an aib feature .",
    "if this is also the case for iras 01005 + 7910 , the estimated strength of the @xmath17@xmath1 m feature would be the upper limit .",
    "@xcite presented the _",
    "iso_-sws spectrum of iras 01005 + 7910 covering a wavelength range of 2.445.4@xmath1 m . due to the lower sensitivity of the _ iso _ sws compared to the irs ,",
    "the c@xmath0 features are completely overwhelmed by the noise in the _ iso _ spectrum .",
    "however , a strong feature at 30@xmath1 m is detected by _",
    "iso _ , and its presence was subsequently confirmed by the _",
    "spitzer_/irs spectrum @xcite .",
    "this seems to support the finding by @xcite that all the c@xmath0 sources exhibit the 30@xmath1 m feature .",

    "archive spectra of the reflection nebulae ngc 2023 and ngc 7023 ( program 40276 , pi : k. sellgren ) do not show the 30@xmath1 m feature .",
    "the 30@xmath1 m feature is commonly seen in carbon - rich agb stars , ppns , and pns @xcite , and has been attributed to solid magnesium sulfide ( mgs ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the identification of mgs as the carrier of the 30@xmath1 m feature is debatable as this feature is only detected in carbon - rich sources .",
    "recently , @xcite found that the mgs dust mass in circumstellar envelopes is not enough to account for the observed feature strength .",
    "therefore , carbonaceous compounds might be more likely to be the carrier of the 30@xmath1 m feature . in order to establish a connection between the 30@xmath1 m feature with the c@xmath0 features , more c@xmath0 sources need to be discovered .    in figure  [ spe ]",

    "all three sources have a strong infrared excess and iras 01005 + 7910 and tc 1 have a very red ( low color temperature ) continuum . iras 01005 + 7910 and",
    "ngc 7023 show strong aib features , which are absent in tc 1 .",
    "the fact that iras 01005 + 7910 does not show the narrow atomic lines as seen in the spectrum of tc 1 is consistent with the object being a ppn and its central star is not hot enough to ionize the surround envelope . after subtracting the continuum , we found that the spectral shape of iras 01005 + 7910 is similar to that of ngc 7023 .",
    "@xcite also detected a few weaker c@xmath18 features in tc 1 , which are not seen in iras 01005 + 7910 and ngc 7023 .",
    "assuming that all the sources have the same c@xmath18/c@xmath0 strength ratio , the c@xmath18 features in iras 01005 + 7910 should be well below the detection limit .",
    "the relative intensities of the c@xmath0 lines reflect the excitation conditions of the molecule . assuming a thermal distribution of the vibrational states , @xcite determined the excitation temperature of tc  1 to be @xmath19k , and suggested that the c@xmath0 molecules are in a solid .",
    "similar temperature values were also derived in the pns studied by @xcite . using a similar procedure as @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "we have constructed a vibrational diagram for iras 01005 + 7910 from the observed fluxes of the three c@xmath0 lines ( figure  [ ro ] ) .",
    "an excitation temperature of @xmath20k is derived .",
    "the c@xmath0 line ratios in iras 01005 + 7910 are @xmath21 and @xmath22 , which are very close to the values found by in ngc 7023 ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ; * ? ? ?",
    "since the central star of iras 01005 + 7910 has a similar temperature as ngc 7023 ( @xmath25k ) , it is possible that the c@xmath0 molecules in iras 01005 + 7910 and ngc 7023 are excited in a similar manner .",
    "@xcite suggests that c@xmath0 molecules in ngc 7023 are in the gas phase and they are excited by uv photons from the central star followed by radiative cascade .",
    "if this is also the case for iras 01005 + 7910 , then the excitation temperature derived above is just a representation of population distribution and is not related to other physical quantities such as kinetic temperature of the gas .",
    "laboratory measurements show that the wavelengths of gas - phase c@xmath0 bands shift with temperature @xcite .",
    "the positions of the four infrared bands @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 shifts from 6.97 , 8.40 , 17.41 , and 18.82 at 0k to 7.11 , 8.55 , 17.53 , 18.97 at 1000k , respectively .",
    "our measurements show that the wavelengths of all c@xmath0 bands in iras 01005 + 7910 lie inside these ranges . assuming that the frequencies of the c@xmath0 bands have a linear dependence on the temperature",
    ", we can estimate the temperature as 100600k .",
    "the observed widths of the c@xmath0 features are about 0.3 @xmath1 m ( see section 3 ) , which correspond to a wavenumber width of @xmath2660 @xmath27 and @xmath2610 @xmath27 for the 7 and 17.4/18.9 @xmath1 m bands respectively .",
    "these values can be compared with the laboratory measured widths of about @xmath2613 @xmath27 of gas - phase c@xmath0 @xcite , suggesting that a gas - phase origin of the molecule can not be ruled out .",
    "we estimate the abundance of c@xmath0 following the same method of @xcite by calculating the total strength ratios between the c@xmath0 and aib features and assuming that the carrier of the aib features to contain @xmath28% of interstellar carbon @xcite .",
    "the strength ratio of c@xmath0 to aib emission is 0.01 in the observed wavelength range of iras 01005 + 7910 , resulting in a percentage of carbon in c@xmath0 of @xmath29@xmath30 .",
    "this value is slightly lower than those obtained in ngc 7023 @xcite and the pn smp smc 16 @xcite , but a factor of 25 lower than that of tc  1 estimated by @xcite .    with the detection of c@xmath0 in circumstellar envelopes ,",
    "the next question is how they are formed . in the laboratory",
    ", c@xmath0 can be effectively produced from the vaporization of graphite in a hydrogen - poor environment .",
    "@xcite proposed that fullerenes are produced only in hydrogen - poor envelopes created by a late agb thermal pulse .",
    "however , @xcite argued that c@xmath0 can be synthesized under hydrogen - containing environment .",
    "as shown in figure .",
    "[ spe ] , the spectrum of iras 01005 + 7910 exhibits both hydrogen - containing aibs and c@xmath0 features , supporting the latter hypothesis .",
    "@xcite also suggested that both c@xmath0 and pahs are the products of decomposition of hacs . in this scenario ,",
    "photochemical processing can lead to dehydrogenation of the dust grains and form pahs and c@xmath0 molecules @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the dehydrogenation of dust grains can also induce the formation of h@xmath31 in the grain surfaces ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the strongest h@xmath31 line in the observed wavelength range is the 00 s(0 ) transition at 28@xmath1 m .",
    "this line is not detected in the spectrum of iras 01005 + 7910 @xcite .",
    "moreover , we have detected h@xmath31 in two ppns with no detectable c@xmath0 @xcite . because of this lack of correlation between the presence of h@xmath31 and c@xmath0 , we are unable to give addition support for the idea that the formation of c@xmath0 is the result of dehydrogenation of hacs .",
    "our detection suggests that fullerenes can be formed in the ppn stage .",
    "so far , there is no definite detection of c@xmath0 in agb stars .",
    "although @xcite noted a possible emission feature centered at 8.6@xmath1 m in the spectrum of the bright agb star irc+10216 , the other c@xmath0 features were not detected in the _",
    "iso_-sws spectrum @xcite .",
    "the circumstellar spectra of agb stars are dominated by silicates or silicon carbide emission features @xcite .",
    "although there are a small number of agb stars exhibiting aibs , the aibs mainly emerge in the post - agb phase .",
    "is it possible that the formation of c@xmath0 is related to the emergence of the aib features ?",
    "@xcite found the c@xmath0 and aib emissions in ngc 7023 have different spatial distributions and attributed this to the effect of uv - excitation .",
    "it can be argued that the c@xmath0 and the aib carriers are already present in the agb phase of evolution but are not excited until the stars evolve to the ppn phase .",
    "however , comparisons between the spectra of agb stars , ppns , and pns suggest a sequence of molecular synthesis , with acetylenes forming in the late agb phase , leading to the formation of diacetylenes , triacetylenes , and benzene in the ppn phase @xcite . since these molecules are detected in absorption",
    ", the question of excitation does not arise .",
    "since benzene is the first step toward the synthesis of aromatic materials , we can say with confidence that aromatic compounds only form after the agb .",
    "if c@xmath0 molecules are synthesized during the agb , they should be detectable with absorption spectroscopy .",
    "the detection of c@xmath0 in a ppn as reported in this paper , together with the detection of this molecule in 5 pns , confirm that the late stages of stellar evolution is a phase of active molecular synthesis . beginning with simple diatomic molecules such as co , cn , c@xmath31 ,",
    "dozens of gas - phase organic molecules have been seen in the stellar winds from agb stars .",
    "the formation of acetylene during the late agb phase is believed to lead to the formation of benzene in the post - agb phase of evolution .",
    "this also coincides with the first detection of vibrational modes of aromatic and aliphatic compounds . from this study",
    ", we now learn that gas - phase c@xmath0 molecules may also form during the same epoch . as the number of c@xmath0 detection increases",
    ", we would be in better position to study the relationships between c@xmath0 and the carriers of other spectral features such as the aibs , and 21- and 30-@xmath1 m features .",
    "the detection of c@xmath0 in the outflows from evolved stars also raises the possibility of the molecule being detected in the diffuse interstellar medium as the molecule is stable and should be able to survive journeys through the interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "the fact that a large variety of presolar grains ( e.g. , sic ) have been detected in meteorites @xcite raises the possibility that presolar c@xmath0 can be incorporated into comets and asteroids and be detected in meteorites .",
    "in fact , c@xmath0 and c@xmath18 , as well as higher fullerenes , have been detected in the allende meteorite @xcite .",
    "the evidence for stellar synthesis of c@xmath0 in the late stages of stellar evolution as presented in this paper therefore adds further support to the idea of chemical enrichment of the solar system by stellar molecular products .",
