    "superconductivity in transition metal oxides ( copper oxides or cuprates ) , pnictides ( iron arsenides ) , or chalcogenides ( fese , kfe@xmath0se@xmath0 ) have attracted increasing attention recently , not only because of the extraordinary high transition temperatures achieved in some systems , but also because of the proximity of those systems to long - range magnetic orders in form of antiferromagnetism ( cuprates)@xcite or spin density waves ( pnictides).@xcite as a consequence , `` unconventional '' pairing symmetries ( d - wave in cuprates , s@xmath1 in pnictides ) mediated by spin fluctuations have been proposed to explain the superconducting properties of these systems.@xcite the magnetic fluctuations play a significant role@xcite and evidence for a magnetic quantum critical point , hidden in the superconducting dome , was found in several pnictides.@xcite structurally , cuprates and pnictides have in common the layered structure with active superconducting layers ( cuo@xmath0 in cuprates and feas in pnictides ) separated by charge reservoir blocks .    superconductivity commonly arises through charge doping from a nonsuperconducting parent compound which , in most cuprates and pnictides , exhibits magnetic order in the ground state .",
    "charge doping can be achieved by either varying the oxygen content ( in cuprates the oxygen content can be controlled by synthesis and annealing , in pnictides oxygen can be replaced by fluorine or hydrogen ) or by replacing cations with ions of different valency ( for example , sr for la in la@xmath0cuo@xmath2 or k for ba in bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 ) . however , there are exemptions from the rule .",

    "<S> superconductivity in a novel class of layered materials , ti - based pnictide oxides , was recently discovered . </S>",
    "<S> these compounds have attracted interest since they combine features of copper oxide and iron pnictide superconductors . here the transition metal ( titanium ) forms two - dimensional ti@xmath0o layers ( anti structure to the cuo@xmath0 planes ) , capped by pnictogen ions ( similar to fe@xmath0as@xmath0 layers ) . </S>",
    "<S> the pnictide oxide compounds show a spin or charge density wave phase which coexists with superconductivity in some members of the family . unlike the cuprates , but similar to iron pnictides , the parent compounds of pnictide oxides are metals with specific nesting properties of the fermi surface which leads to the density wave instability . </S>",
    "<S> the nature of the superconductivity , coexisting with the density wave order , and the possible competition or mutual interaction between both states is one of the central questions of recent studies . </S>",
    "<S> this short review summarizes the current knowledge from an experimental as well as theoretical point of view and discusses some of the open questions and possible future developments . </S>"
