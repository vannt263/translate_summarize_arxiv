    "phase transition in a given physico - chemical system is characterized by parameters like the range of the microscopic interactions , the space dimensionality @xmath1 and the dimensionality of the order parameter , often referred to the spin dimensionality @xmath2 .",
    "there are features whose qualitative nature is determined by the universality class to which the system belongs .",
    "short - range interactions , double and super - exchange nearest - neighbor type , classical and quantum spins @xmath2 in @xmath1-dimensional systems have been studied @xcite .",
    "double - exchange ( de ) interaction or indirect exchange , is the source of a variety of magnetic behavior in transition metal and rare - earth compounds@xcite .",
    "the origin of de lies in the intra - atomic coupling of the spin of itinerant electrons with localized spins @xmath3 .",
    "this coupling favors a ferromagnetic ( f ) background of local spins and may lead to interesting transport properties such as colossal magnetoresistance .",
    "this mechanism has been widely used in the context of manganites @xcite .",
    "this f tendency is expected to be frustrated by anti - ferromagnetic ( af ) inter - atomic super - exchange ( se ) interactions between localized spins @xmath3 as first discussed by de gennes@xcite who conjectured the existence of canted states.in spite of recent interesting advances , our knowledge of magnetic ordering resulting from this competition is still incomplete .",
    "although it may look academic , the one - dimensional ( 1d ) version of this model is very illustrative and helpful in building an unifying picture . on the other hand , the number of pertinent real 1d systems as the nickelate one - dimensional metal oxide carrier - doped compound @xmath0@xcite is increasing .",
    "haldane gap @xmath4 has been observed for the parental compound @xmath5 @xmath6 ( s=1 ) from susceptibility and neutron scattering measurements . in these compounds",
    ", carriers are essentially constrained to move parallel to @xmath7 chains and a spin - glass - like behavior was found at very low temperature @xmath8 for typical dopings @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 . at high temperature curie - like behavior of the magnetic susceptibility was found .",
    "the question is how physical properties change by introducing @xmath12 holes in the system . in the doped case",
    "the itineracy of doped electrons or holes plays an important role taken into account by the double - exchange mechanism .",
    "recently , it has been shown that three - leg ladders in the oxyborate system fe@xmath13bo@xmath14 may provide evidence for the existence of spin and charge ordering resulting from such a competition@xcite .",

    "phase separation and small ferromagnetic polarons have been also identified for localized @xmath17 quantum spins @xcite .",
    "in addition to the expected f - af phase separation appearing for small super - exchange coupling , a new phase separation between small polarons ordered ( one electron within two or three sites ) and af regions for larger se coupling was found @xcite .",
    "these phase separations are degenerate with phases where the polarons can be ordered or not giving a natural response to the instability at the fermi energy and to an infinite compressibility as well .",
    "wigner crystallization and spin - glass - like behavior were also obtained and could explain the spin - glass - like behavior observed in the nickelate 1d doped compound @xmath0 @xcite .    in this paper , we present a study of the parallel static magnetic susceptibility in an ising - like exchange model .",

    "results and a discussion are presented .",
    "finally , our results are summarized in section iv .",
    "the de  hamiltonian is originally of the form , @xmath18where @xmath19 are the fermions creation ( annihilation ) operators of the conduction electrons at site @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the hopping parameter and @xmath22 is the electronic conduction band spin operator . in the second term",

    "this hamiltonian simplifies in the strong coupling limit @xmath25 , a limit commonly called itself the de model . in this strong coupling limit",
    "itinerant electrons are now either parallel or anti - parallel to local spins and are thus spinless .",
    "the complete one dimensional de+se hamiltonian becomes , @xmath26 @xmath27 is the relative angle between localized spins at sites @xmath20 , @xmath28 defined with respect to a z - axis taken as the spin quantization axis of the itinerant electrons .",

    "an electron ( hole)-single approximation will be used .",

    "@xmath35 is basically localized while @xmath34 has finite overlap with @xmath36 orbital of the o @xcite .",

    "there is an electron - hole symmetry .",
    "exact parallel static magnetic susceptibility @xmath39 and short - range spin - spin correlations are presented using a standard canonical ensemble . to obtain @xmath39 within the electron ( hole)-single approximation is necessary to calculate eigenvalues of the following matrix    @xmath40    where    @xmath41    in the former equation first term is super - exchange interaction and the second one is the zeeman coupling of the localized background of s=1/2 spins .",
