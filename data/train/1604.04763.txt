    "optical imaging surveys of planetary nebulae ( pne ) have revealed that a fraction of pne possess , besides the large - scale structures such as rims , shells , haloes , some small - scale structures ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these structures are prominent in the low - ionization emission lines such as [ n  ii ] , [ s  ii ] and [ o  i ] ( hereafter liss ) .",
    "they exhibit a variety of morphologies like knots , jets , and filaments , ( @xcite ) , whereas they cover a wide range of expansion velocities from 30 km s@xmath4 up to 350 km s@xmath4 .",
    "akras & gonalves ( @xcite ) , studying a sample of galactic pne with liss , demonstrate that the excitation mechanism of these structures is a combination of uv - photons and shocks .",
    "the contribution of each mechanism depends on parameters like the distance of liss to the central star , the stellar parameters ( @xmath5 , l@xmath6 ) and lis s expansion velocity .",
    "the physical properties like @xmath7 , @xmath8 and chemical abundances of liss have been studied by different groups ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , and some of the most important conclusions are : i ) there is no difference in @xmath7 between the liss and the nebular components , ii ) liss have systematically lower @xmath8 compared to the surrounding medium ( e.g.@xcite , @xcite ) and iii ) there is no difference in chemical abundances that could provide an explanation for the enhancement of the low - ionization emission lines .",
    "the formations models of liss predict that they are denser structures than the surrounding ionized medium .",
    "this result is found to be inconsistent with the observations . a possible explanation for this discrepancy may be that the formation models refer to the total density of gas ( dust , atomic and molecular ) and not only to the @xmath8 .",
    "gonalves et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have proposed that liss may also be made of molecular gas .",
    "h@xmath0 emission has been detected in the cometary knots in the helix ( @xcite , @xcite ) and knots / filaments in ngc 2346 ( @xcite ) .",
    "generally , h@xmath0 emission has been detected in several pne ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a comparison of h@xmath0 and optical line ( e.g. [ n  ii ] and [ o  i ] ) images has revealed similar morphologies , suggesting that both emissions emanate from the same regions .",
    "a recent theoretical work by aleman & gruenwald ( @xcite ) has shown that the peak intensities of the optical low - ionization and h@xmath0 lines occur in a narrow transition zone between the ionized and neutral ( photo - dissociation ) regions . moreover ,",
    "an empirical relation between the fluxes of the [ o i ] @xmath96300 and h@xmath0 v=1 - 0 s(1 ) lines for galactic pne was reported by reay et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "hence , the detection of strong low - ionization lines in liss may also suggest the presence of h@xmath0 gas .",
    "the deepest , high - angular resolution h@xmath0 v=1 - 0 s(1 ) at 2.122 @xmath1 m and h@xmath0 v=2 - 1 s(1 ) at 2.242 @xmath1 m images were obtained for k  4 - 47 and ngc  7662 using the niri instrument on the gemini - north 8  m telescope on manua kea in hawaii . for these observations , the f/6 configuration ( pixel scale=0.117  arcsec and field of view of 120 arcsec ) was used .",
    "the exposure times were estimated using the empirical relation from reay et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the final continuum - subtracted images are presented in figures 1 and 2 .",
    "line images of the bipolar planetary nebula k 4 - 47 .",
    "( a ) continuum subtracted h@xmath0 v=1 - 0 s(1 ) , ( b ) h@xmath0 v=2 - 1 s(1 ) emission lines . ]",
    "the narrow - band near - ir h@xmath0 images of k 4 - 47 ( fig .",
    "1 ) reveal a remarkable high - collimated bipolar structure with the emission arising from the walls of the bipolar outflows . at the tips of these outflows",
    "lies a pair of fast - moving , low - ionization knots ( 100  km  s@xmath4 ; @xcite ) .",
    "these knots exhibit very strong [ n  i ]  @xmath95200 and [ o  i ]  @xmath96300 emission lines that are usually attributed to high - velocity shocks .",
    "gonalves et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , running a number of shock models , came to the conclusion that the expansion velocity of these knots must be up to 250300  km  s@xmath4 in order to reproduce these lines . despite their very high velocities , their h@xmath0 v=1 - 0 s(1)/h@xmath0 v=2 - 1 s(1 )",
    "line ratio is found to be @xmath27 , lower than the typical value of 10 for shock - excited regions ( @xcite ) .",
    "regarding the bipolar outflows , a comparison between our near - ir and optical images from @xcite illustrates that the ionized gas ( optical emission ) is concentrated in a inner highly collimated structure , surrounded by the h@xmath0 outflows .",
    "this structure of k  4 - 47 completely resembles that of the m  2 - 9 and crl  618 pne indicating a possible connection among these objects .",
    "the large h@xmath0 v=1 - 0 s(1)/h@xmath0 v=2 - 1 s(1 ) line ratio , estimated in the bipolar shell , was unexpected .",
    "although , the recent hydrodynamic models by balick b. and collaborators ( @xcite ) can adequately explain our findings .",
    "the h@xmath0 emission from the bipolar outflows can be explained as the result of the interactions between a jet or bullet with the agb material .",
    "as the jet / bullet moves through the agb material forms an conical structure that expands laterally outward with a velocity that increases with the distance from the central star . at the same time",
    ", the jet / bullet continues moving outwards , with a velocity proportional to the distance from the central star , dissociating the agb h@xmath0 gas , which later is being ionized by uv - photons ( optical images ) .",
    "the surface brightnesses in the h@xmath0 v=1 - 0 s(1 ) and h@xmath0 v=2 - 1 s(1 ) emission lines are found to range from 0.2 to 1@xmath1010@xmath11  erg  cm@xmath4  s@xmath4  arc@xmath13 and from 0.2 to 1 @xmath1010@xmath14  erg  cm@xmath4  s@xmath4  arc@xmath13 , respectively .",
    "continuum subtracted h@xmath0 v=1 - 0 s(1 ) line image of the elliptical planetary nebula ngc  7662 .",
    "the arrows indicate the four liss in which the h@xmath0 v=2 - 1 s(1 ) emission is detected . ]",
    "ngc 7662 is an elliptical pn that posses almost two dozens of liss ( knots and a jet - like structure ) embedded in the outer shell with expansion velocities that vary from 30 to 70 km s@xmath4 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "all these structures are easily discerned in the [ n  ii ] line image ( @xcite ) , whereas spectroscopic data have revealed that they also exhibit a strong [ o  i ]  @xmath96300 line ( @xcite,@xcite ) . despite",
    "that the former line is a strong indicator of shock interactions , most of the liss have low velocities except from the southern jet - like feature .",
    "( see @xcite ) .    here",
    ", we present the deepest near - ir images of this nebula .",
    "the h@xmath0 v=1 - 0 s(1 ) emission line is detected in almost all optically identified liss ( fig .  2 , right panel .",
    ") , whereas only four liss are found to have h@xmath0 v=2 - 1 s(1 ) emission .",
    "the former line is found to range from 1 to 4.8 @xmath10 10@xmath14  erg  cm@xmath4  s@xmath4  arc@xmath13 , whereas the latter from 0.6 to 1 @xmath10 10@xmath14  erg  cm@xmath4  s@xmath4  arc@xmath13 .",
    "no h@xmath0 emission is found associated with the nebular shells .",
    "this confirms that liss are likely molecular condensations embedded in a nebula .",
    "the value of h@xmath0 v=1 - 0 s(1)/h@xmath0 v=2 - 1 s(1 ) line ratio is found to range between 3 and 5 .",
    "these values imply that the liss in this nebula are predominantly photo - ionized .",
    "nevertheless , shocks can not be discarded .",

    "vs. log(@xmath15 / @xmath16 ) for k 4 - 47 ( @xcite ) and ngc 7662 ( @xcite ) from the diagnostic diagram of akras & gonalves ( @xcite ) for photo - ionized and shock - excited regions .",
    "the numbers indicate the value of the h@xmath0 v=1 - 0 s(1)/h@xmath0 v=2 - 1 s(1 ) line ratio from six liss ( the pair of knots in k 4 - 47 and the four knots in ngc  7662 ) . ]",
    "new , deep , high - angular resolution near - ir h@xmath0 images confirmed the presence of molecular gas in fast- ( k 4 - 47 ) and slow - moving liss ( ngc  7662 ) .",
    "h@xmath0 emission was also detected in the dense walls of the bipolar outflows of k 4 - 47 that implies a lateral expansion in agreement with the predictions from hydrodynamic models .",
    "important morphological similarities among k  4 - 47 , m  2 - 9 and crl  618 have been found .    in the ngc  7662 nebula ,",
    "h@xmath0 emission was detected in several liss , while it is totally absent in the nebular shells . using the new diagnostic diagram from akras & gonalves ( @xcite ) , and the spectroscopic data of the six liss with measured h@xmath0 v=1 - 0 s(1)/h@xmath0 v=2 - 1 s(1 ) line ratio",
    ", we found that the near - ir line ratio increases with the [ n  ii]/h@xmath3 optical line ratio ( fig .  3 ) .",
    "this result may reflect a similar origin for the near - ir and optical line ratios . in conclusion , the h@xmath0 emission in k  4 - 47 is powered by shocks , whereas in ngc  7662 is due to photo - ionization by the central star with a possible contribution of shocks .",
