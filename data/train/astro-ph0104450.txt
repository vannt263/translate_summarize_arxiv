    "the virial theorem shows that a star deprived of any energy sources will shrink and its kinetic energy will grow which normally implies it will get hotter . in the 1920 s eddington ( 1926 )",
    "was puzzled as to how a star could ever cool down and end its life .",
    "this problem , together with the mystery of white dwarfs such as sirius b , was beautifully solved by r. h. fowler ( 1926 ) who realised that the electrons would become degenerate , as in a metal , so the star could then be supported by the degeneracy pressure which is an inevitable consequence of the zero - point energy combined with the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "even bodies of zero temperature have such a pressure which supports the white dwarfs against gravity .",
    "stoner ( 1929 ) made early models of white dwarfs to compare their densities with the theory but anderson ( 1929 ) rightly criticised him for not allowing for the relativistic motions of electrons forced to very high densities .",
    "he showed that when this was allowed for , there would be a limiting mass beyond which no cold white dwarf models could exist .",
    "his estimate of the limiting mass was not very good , but stoner ( 1930 ) then modified his own calculations and calculated the limit for homogeneous models which gave an answer good to 10% .",
    "meanwhile , chandrasekhar ( 1931 ) had developed the theory independently starting from fowler s work .",
    "he realised that the limiting configuration would be an @xmath12 polytrope and gave the first accurate determination of the chandrasekhar limit .",
    "more detailed models of white dwarfs were given by salpeter ( 1967 ) who derived conditions for their solidification and determined properties of the lattice .",
    "shapiro and teukolsky in their book give a definitive account of how all this extends to neutron stars .",
    "here our aim is much more modest . to give a rough approximate formula for the radius of any cold body as a function of its mass .",
    "we illustrate how the balance between degeneracy pressure , the electrical attraction of electrons to atomic nuclei , and gravitation lead to a mathematical formula that describes the mass - radius relationship for cold bodies .",
    "this holds from asteroids , through planets and brown dwarfs to white dwarfs and neutron stars .",
    "understanding rather than accuracy is our aim so we shall use interpolation formulae where they are simpler , nevertheless we shall ensure accuracy in important limiting cases . thus we aspire to follow the fine tradition set in salpeter s 1967 lectures .    at masses below that of saturn ,",
    "the degeneracy pressure of the electrons within the atoms ( vide the thomas fermi atom ) is balanced by the electrical binding .",
    "while the gravity serves to hold the whole body in a nearly spherical shpae , it is not strong enough to crush the atoms into significantly smaller volumes .",
    "thus the material is nearly incompressible and apart from any chemical fractionation the lighter bodies have the same density .",
    "however , above the mass of saturn the gravitational potential energy increases to become comparable with the electrical one . above the mass of jupiter , the gravitation dominates",
    ", the atoms are crushed together with the outer electrons eventually bcoming pressure ionised to make a continuous sea .",
    "in fact , somewhat above jupiter s mass , the weight of each layer added so compresses the material within that the whole body shrinks in radius .",
    "the electron sea is not so dense that the zero point energy drives the electrons to speeds close to that of light , so they give fowler s @xmath13 as an equation of state as in @xmath14 polytropes .",
    "the @xmath15 energy behaves as @xmath16 .",
    "although the @xmath17 gravitational energy rises with a higher power of the mass , the total energy achieves its minimum at the ( equilibrium ) radius with @xmath18 .",
    "this is the brown dwarf white dwarf sequence .",
    "however , as @xmath3 is further increased the increasing density of the bodies @xmath19 leads to zero point agitation with relativistic speeds .",
    "this results in the pressure density relationship @xmath20 with @xmath21 . as this",
    "is approached the equilibrium radius rapidly becomes very small and very sensitive to mass because both gravitational and internal energies scale with the same power of the radius .",
    "no force balance is possible beyond chandrasekhar s limiting mass .    in neutron",
    "stars the electrical energy is unimportant ; most of the electrons have combined with protons and been transformed into neutrons so that neutron degeneracy supplies the pressure .",
    "neutron star radii are smaller than white dwarf radii by the factor @xmath22 so the densities are @xmath23 times greater .",
    "a secondary aim of this article is to express the important masses that arise in astronomy in terms of the fundamental physical constants .",
    "thus the ratio of the chandrasekhar mass to the mass of the planet of maximum radiu is essentially the fine structure constant raised to the power @xmath24 .",
    "such matters are of particular importance to the misguided few who seriously entertain theories in which such fundamental constants change .",
    "the kinetic energy of an electron is given by @xmath25\\ \\ .",
