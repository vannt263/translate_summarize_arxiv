    "left modular lattices were introduced by blass and sagan [ bs ] as a further generalization of supersolvable lattices . in [ mt ] , combining results from [ mc ] and [ li ] , mcnamara and the author showed that left modularity for lattices can be thought of as `` supersolvability without gradedness , '' in the sense that supersolvable lattices are left modular ( as was shown in [ st ] ) , and all graded left modular lattices are supersolvable [ mt ] .",

    "we say that a lattice is _ trim _ if it has a maximal chain of @xmath10 left modular elements , exactly @xmath11 join - irreducibles , and exactly @xmath11 meet - irreducibles ( that is to say , the minimum possible number of each ) .",
    "distributive lattices are example of trim lattices , though not typical examples , since distributive lattices are graded and trim lattices need not be . however",
    ", if a lattice is graded and trim , then it is distributive ( theorem 2 ) .",
    "this is a special case of a theorem of markowsky [ ma ] .    in this paper , we investigate some of the properties of trim lattices , and show that they are in many respects similar to distributive lattices .",
    "we show that if @xmath5 is trim , then so are its intervals ( theorem 1 ) , and so are its sublattices which contain its left modular chain ( theorem 3 ) . we also show that if @xmath12 is a group which acts on a trim lattice @xmath5 by lattice automorphisms , then @xmath13 , the sublattice of @xmath5 consisting of elements fixed by @xmath12 , is again trim ( theorem 4 ) .",
    "we show that a trim lattice satisfies the level condition of [ bs ] ( theorem 5 ) . left modular lattices satisfying this condition are known as ll - lattices [ bs ] ; thus , trim lattices are ll - lattices .",
    "one consequence of theorem 5 is that in a trim lattice , if @xmath14 is covered by @xmath15 and @xmath16 , then @xmath17 covers at least one of @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( theorem 6 ) .",
    "this is a weakened form of modularity .",
    "another consequence of theorem 5 is that the order complex of a trim lattice is either contractible or homotopic to a sphere , and the latter holds exactly when the maximum element of the lattice is a join of atoms ( theorem 7 ) .",
    "( note that since intervals of trim lattices are trim , theorem 7 can also be applied to any interval in a trim lattice , thus showing that the order complex of any interval is again either homotopic to a sphere or contractible . )    in [ re ] , reading introduced a family of _ cambrian lattices _ for each finite reflection group .",

    "we show that all the cambrian lattices in types @xmath0 and @xmath1 are trim ( theorems 8 and 9 ) .",
    "the cambrian lattices in the other types are not yet well understood , but we offer the following conjecture :    all cambrian lattices are trim .",
    "the proofs in this paper depend on the theory of left modular lattices .",
    "the study of such lattices was initiated by blass and sagan [ bs ] , and continued in liu [ li ] , liu and sagan [ ls ] , and mcnamara and thomas [ mt ] .",
    "we will begin with a review of the properties of left modular lattices .",
    "more details on all of these properties can be found in [ mt ] .",
    "if @xmath5 has a left modular maximal chain @xmath34 , then any interval @xmath35 $ ] also has a left modular maximal chain .",
    "more precisely , the elements @xmath36 form a left modular maximal chain in @xmath35 $ ] .",
    "( note that the @xmath37 will not all be distinct . )",
    "we define three edge - labellings of a left modular lattice @xmath5 with left modular maximal chain @xmath38 , which we refer to as the labelling induced from join - irreducibles , that induced from meet - irreducibles , and that induced from the left modular chain .",
    "( note that these labellings all depend on the prior choice of a left modular maximal chain . )",
    "if @xmath39 is a join - irreducible of @xmath5 , we label it by the natural number @xmath40 now , for any @xmath41 , define @xmath42    the labelling induced from meet - irreducibles is defined similarly . if @xmath39 is a meet - irreducible , we set @xmath43 ( except for the @xmath44 , this is just the dual of the definition of @xmath45 . ) now , as we did for the labelling induced from join - irreducibles , for @xmath41 , we define @xmath46    thirdly , the labelling induced from the left modular chain is defined as follows : @xmath47    for any left modular lattice with a specified left modular maximal chain , the three labellings @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 coincide .",
    "the fact that @xmath48 and @xmath50 coincide is proved in [ li ] ; the dual of that result shows that @xmath49 and @xmath50 coincide .",
    "since the three labellings coincide , we will drop the subscripts and denote the labelling by @xmath51 .",
    "a labelling of the edges of the hasse diagram of a poset is called an el - labelling [ b1 ] if it satisfies the following two properties :    \\(i ) in any interval , there is a unique maximal chain which has the property that the labels on the chain strictly increase as you read up the chain .",
    "( this chain is called the `` increasing chain '' . )",
    "\\(ii ) in any interval , the label word obtained by reading up the increasing chain lexicographically precedes the word obtained by reading up any other maximal chain in the interval .",
    "( in our context , the labellings of the edges of a hasse diagram will always be positive integers with the usual order .",
    "in general , the labels may be drawn from any poset ; this introduces some additional technicalities which we shall not need to refer to . )",
    "if a partially ordered set admits an el - labelling then its order complex is shellable , and is therefore homotopic to a wedge of spheres , one for each maximal chain such that the labels weakly decrease as you read up the chain .",
    "( such chains are called `` decreasing chains '' . ) the dimension of the sphere corresponding to a given decreasing chain is two less than the length of the chain .    for a left modular lattice @xmath5 , the edge - labelling of @xmath5 already described is an el - labelling .",
    "in fact , we can say more about the labelling of a left modular lattice . in [ mt ] , we defined _ interpolating labellings _ to be el - labellings such that in addition , if @xmath52 is a maximal chain which is not increasing , and the corresponding increasing chain is @xmath53 , then the label of @xmath54 coincides with the label of @xmath55 , and the label of @xmath56 coincides with the label of @xmath57 .",
    "we showed the following proposition :    if @xmath5 is a left modular lattice , then the labelling defined above is interpolating .",
    "conversely , if a lattice @xmath5 admits an interpolating labelling , then the elements of the increasing chain from @xmath8 to @xmath9 are left modular , and therefore @xmath5 is left modular .",
    "we need one more result from [ mt ] about labellings of intervals .",
    "let @xmath35 $ ] be an interval in a left modular lattice @xmath5 .",

    "the restriction of the labelling of @xmath5 to @xmath35 $ ] also yields an el - labelling .",
    "these two labellings typically do not coincide for the trivial reason that their label sets differ .",
    "however , we have the following proposition :    let @xmath35 $ ] be an interval in a lattice @xmath5 with left modular maximal chain @xmath38 .",
    "the labelling of @xmath5 restricted to @xmath35 $ ] agrees ( up to an order - preserving relabelling ) with the labelling which @xmath35 $ ] has as a lattice with left modular chain @xmath37 .",
    "( when we speak of an order - preserving relabelling , we mean that one label set has been replaced by a different label set , but the relative orders of the labels have been preserved . )",
    "we record here one additional lemma about left modular lattices which we shall need .",
    "let @xmath5 be a lattice with left modular maximal chain @xmath58 , and let @xmath15 and @xmath16 be two join - irreducibles with @xmath59 .",

    "extremal lattices were introduced by markowsky in [ ma ] .",
    "there , he showed that graded extremal lattices are distributive . since trim lattices are by definition extremal , theorem 2 follows .",
    "however , in the interests of self - containedness , we give a different proof .",
    "it is worth noting that there are extremal lattices which are not trim .",
    "markowsky shows that any finite lattice can be embedded as an interval of an extremal lattice , while theorem 1 tells us that the intervals of trim lattices are trim .",
    "these two results imply that not all extremal lattices are trim .",
    "in particular , [ ma ] gives an example of an extremal lattice with 39 elements containing @xmath89 ( see below ) as an interval ; since @xmath89 is not trim , we know that this example is not trim .    to show that a lattice is distributive , it suffices to show that it has no sublattice @xmath89 or @xmath90 ( see figure 2 ) [ gr , theorem ii.1 ] .",

    "as always , let @xmath11 be the maximum label on the increasing chain from @xmath8 to @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath1 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 denote the set of labels on the increasing chains from @xmath8 to @xmath75 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 respectively .",
    "suppose some two of them , say @xmath1 and @xmath93 , both contain @xmath11 .",
    "then @xmath75 and @xmath95 both lie over some join - irreducible labelled @xmath11 .",
    "since @xmath97 , there is more than one join - irreducible labelled @xmath11 , contradicting lemma 2 .    on the other hand ,",
    "suppose that some two of @xmath1 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , say @xmath1 and @xmath93 , do not contain @xmath11 .",
    "since @xmath11 is the maximum label on the increasing chain from @xmath8 to @xmath9 , we can see from the labelling induced from meet - irreducibles that every maximal chain from @xmath8 to @xmath9 contains an edge labelled @xmath11 .",
    "thus , it occurs on both the increasing chain from @xmath75 to @xmath9 and on the increasing chain from @xmath95 to @xmath9 .",
    "we now apply the dual of the previous argument to obtain a contradiction in this case also .",
    "since either two of @xmath1 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 contain @xmath11 or two do not , we are done .",
    "let @xmath5 be a graded trim lattice .",
    "then @xmath5 contains no @xmath90 .",
    "as in the proof of the previous lemma , we may assume that the minimum and maximum elements of the @xmath90 are @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "let the other elements be identified as in figure 2 .",
    "let @xmath1 be the set of labels on the increasing chain from @xmath4 to @xmath15 .",
    "suppose that the increasing chain from @xmath8 to @xmath16 has a label drawn from @xmath1 , say @xmath75 .",
    "then @xmath16 and @xmath15 both lie over join - irreducibles with label @xmath75 . by the assumption that @xmath5 is trim",
    ", there is only one join - irreducible labelled @xmath75 , so @xmath16 and @xmath15 both lie over it , which contradicts the assumption that @xmath98 .",
    "dually , no label from @xmath1 can occur on the increasing chain from @xmath16 to @xmath9 .",
    "however , since we are assuming that @xmath5 is graded , the set of labels appearing on every maximal chain from @xmath8 to @xmath9 is the same , and we have a contradiction .",
    "this completes the proof of theorem 2 .",
    "if @xmath5 is trim , and @xmath99 is a sublattice of @xmath5 containing the left modular chain of @xmath5 , then @xmath99 is trim .",
    "it is clear that the left modular chain in @xmath5 is still left modular in @xmath99 , so @xmath99 is left modular .",
    "suppose @xmath99 is not trim .",
    "therefore , @xmath99 has either two join - irreducibles with the same label , or two meet - irreducibles with the same label .",
    "dualizing if necessary , we may assume that @xmath99 has two join - irreducibles with the same label , say @xmath15 and @xmath16 , with label @xmath75 .",
    "the fact that @xmath15 and @xmath16 are labelled @xmath75 means that @xmath15 and @xmath16 lie below @xmath100 but not below @xmath101 .",
    "this implies that , in @xmath5 , each can be written as a join of join - irreducibles with labels no more than @xmath75 , and including at least one join - irreducible of @xmath5 labelled @xmath75 .",
    "let @xmath102 be the unique join - irreducible of @xmath5 labelled @xmath75 .",
    "so both @xmath15 and @xmath16 lie over @xmath102 .",
    "it follows that @xmath103 also lies over @xmath102 .",
    "so @xmath104 lies below @xmath100 but not below @xmath101 .",
    "it follows that , in @xmath99 , @xmath104 lies over some join - irreducible labelled by @xmath75 . but",
    "this implies that there are two join - irreducibles labelled by @xmath75 in @xmath99 which are comparable , and that is impossible , by lemma 1 .",
    "the goal of this section is to show that if @xmath5 is a trim lattice , and a group @xmath12 acts on @xmath5 by lattice automorphisms , then @xmath13 , the sublattice of @xmath5 consisting of elements of @xmath5 fixed by @xmath12 , is a trim lattice .    to orient oneself in this section ,",
    "it is useful to consider the case where @xmath5 is the boolean lattice of all subsets of @xmath105 $ ] , and @xmath106 where @xmath107 acts by interchanging @xmath108 and @xmath11 .",
    "the first important thing to notice about this example is that the maximal chains in @xmath13 are shorter than the maximal chains in @xmath5 .",
    "the second thing to notice is that if we make a reasonable - seeming choice of left modular chain by setting @xmath109 $ ] , only the top and bottom elements of our chosen left modular chain actually lie in @xmath13 . inspired by this example ,",
    "before we try to show that @xmath13 is trim , we will find some more left modular elements in @xmath5 .",
    "for @xmath5 a trim lattice , we follow the terminology suggested by drew armstrong and say that the _ spine _ of @xmath5 consists of those elements of @xmath5 which lie on some chain of maximum length in @xmath5 .",
    "if @xmath5 is a trim lattice , then all the elements of the spine of @xmath5 are left modular .",
    "this proof was suggested to me by peter mcnamara [ mc2 ] .",
    "suppose @xmath16 is in the spine of @xmath5 .",
    "let the labels which occur on the increasing chain from @xmath8 to @xmath16 be @xmath93 , and let the labels which occur on the label from @xmath16 to @xmath9 be @xmath94 .",

    "now suppose , for the sake of contradiction , that @xmath16 is not left modular .",
    "it follows that there are some elements @xmath111 in @xmath5 such that @xmath112 . since the modular inequality tells us that @xmath113 , it is in fact true that @xmath114 now set @xmath115 , @xmath116 . note that @xmath117 , while @xmath118 .",

    "given a set of roots @xmath328 whose intersection with any rank 2 root system is either initial or final , it is the inversion set of a unique element @xmath219 of @xmath20 [ b2 ] .",
    "we must show that @xmath219 contains neither a @xmath234 nor a @xmath237 .",
    "suppose it does , and suppose first that this pattern involves three elements of distinct absolute values .",
    "if these are all the same sign ( which we may assume to be positive ) then we have found @xmath313 such that @xmath329 has an illegal intersection with @xmath328 .",
    "similarly , if the pattern involves elements not all of the same sign then we are in the other type of @xmath310 root system , while if the pattern involves two elements of the same absolute value , then we are in a similar situation with respect to a @xmath305 root system .",
    "thus , @xmath219 contains no @xmath234 or @xmath237 , and therefore is an element of @xmath236 .",
    "the second statement follows from a similar argument , and the lemma is proved .",
    "now that we understand the possible inversion sets of element of @xmath236 and @xmath238 , we can return to the proof of lemma 8 .",
    "we now proceed to show that the inversion set of @xmath67 intersected with any rank two root system is initial .",
    "consider , for example , a root system of type @xmath305 .",
    "we must determine whether , in our word for @xmath302 , the inversions @xmath330 appear in that order or the reverse order . by inspection ( recalling our explicit description of @xmath95 ) , we see that they occur in the forward order if @xmath322 , and in the backward order if @xmath257 . but now observe that this order on the roots is exactly the order provided by lemma 9 , as desired .",
    "the other types of root systems are dealt with similarly .",
    "this completes the proof of lemma 8 .",
    "we wish to show that the @xmath67 are left modular . by proposition 4 ,",
    "it is sufficient to exhibit an interpolating labelling for @xmath208 such that the @xmath67 form the increasing chain from @xmath8 to @xmath9 .",
    "we now introduce some notation related to @xmath208 . for @xmath331",
    ", we write @xmath332 $ ] for the fibre of the quotient map to @xmath208 which includes @xmath4 .",
    "we also write @xmath333 for the top element of @xmath332 $ ] , and @xmath334 for the bottom element of @xmath332 $ ] .",
    "we define an edge - labelling for @xmath208 as follows .",
    "first , observe that the edges in the hasse diagram of weak order on @xmath20 have a natural labelling by positive roots : we label the edge @xmath335 by @xmath336 .",
    "we now use this labelling to define a labelling for @xmath208 .",
    "suppose @xmath332\\lessdot [ y]$ ] in @xmath208 , with @xmath337 .",
    "then @xmath4 is covered by an element of @xmath338 $ ] , say @xmath339 . then set @xmath340\\lessdot [ y])=i(y')\\setminus i(x)$ ] .    if @xmath335 and @xmath332\\ne [ y]$ ] , then @xmath340\\lessdot [ y])=i(y)\\setminus i(x)$ ] .",
    "let @xmath341 , and let @xmath339 be the element of @xmath338 $ ] covering @xmath342 .",
    "now @xmath343 is in @xmath338 $ ] but lies over @xmath4 , so must equal @xmath15 , which implies that @xmath344 . since @xmath15 does not lie under @xmath342 , but @xmath4 does , @xmath345 , as desired .",
    "we now prove an easy lemma which will be useful for computations in @xmath208 .    if @xmath346 , then @xmath347 . if @xmath348 , then @xmath349 .",
    "we prove the first statement .",
    "observe that @xmath350 has @xmath238-good intersection with every rank 2 root system , and therefore , by lemma 10 , defines an element of @xmath238 .",
    "now it is clear that this element must be the join of @xmath4 and @xmath15 .",
    "the argument for the second statement is similar .",
    "the labelling @xmath51 defined above is an interpolating labelling for @xmath208 .",
    "the first necessity for showing that a labelling is interpolating is to show that it is an el - labelling .",
    "let @xmath351<[w]$ ] in @xmath208 , with @xmath39 and @xmath14 in @xmath238 .",
    "let @xmath352 .",
    "we begin by showing that there is a @xmath16 such that @xmath351\\lessdot [ z ] \\leq [ w]$ ] , with @xmath353 .",
    "let @xmath4 be the element of @xmath354 whose inversion set consists of all roots up to and including @xmath355 in @xmath207-order .",
    "let @xmath356 .",
    "by lemma 26 , @xmath357 .",
    "thus @xmath358\\lessdot [ z])=\\alpha$ ] , and clearly @xmath351\\lessdot [ z]$ ] is the only edge proceeding up from @xmath351 $ ] labelled by @xmath355 .",
    "next we show that every maximal chain from @xmath351 $ ] to @xmath359 $ ] has an edge labelled by @xmath355 .",
    "given a maximal chain , let @xmath360 $ ] be the first element of the chain lying over @xmath16 , and let @xmath361 $ ] be the element lying below @xmath360 $ ] in the chain .",
    "let @xmath362 .",
    "let @xmath363 be the element of @xmath360 $ ] covering @xmath134 .",
    "then @xmath363 lies over @xmath16 but @xmath134 does not , so @xmath364 , and the edge @xmath361\\lessdot [ q]$ ] is labelled @xmath355 .",
    "so @xmath355 is the minimum possible label to occur on any edge of any maximal chain from @xmath351 $ ] to @xmath359 $ ] , and it must occur on every chain .",
    "thus , the first step in any increasing chain from @xmath351 $ ] to @xmath359 $ ] must be labelled @xmath355 , so any increasing chain must begin @xmath351\\lessdot[z]$ ] .",
    "now , by induction , there is a unique increasing chain from @xmath351 $ ] to @xmath359 $ ] .",
    "now we must show that the labelling @xmath51 is interpolating .",
    "so suppose that we have chain of length two which is nt increasing , say @xmath351\\lessdot[u]\\lessdot[w]$ ] .",
    "let us assume that @xmath365 .",
    "let @xmath366\\lessdot[u])$ ] and @xmath367\\lessdot[w])$ ] .",
    "let @xmath351=[y_0]\\lessdot [ y_1]\\lessdot \\dots\\lessdot [ y_r]=[w]$ ] be the increasing chain from @xmath351 $ ] to @xmath359 $ ] .",
    "since @xmath368\\lessdot[y_1])$ ] is the minimum label on any chain in the interval , by what we have just shown it must occur on every chain from @xmath351 $ ] to @xmath359 $ ] .",
    "it can not be that the edge @xmath351\\lessdot [ u]$ ] has this label , so @xmath368\\lessdot[y_1])=\\gamma([u]\\lessdot [ v])$ ] , one of the two conditions necessary for @xmath51 to be interpolating .    in weak order on @xmath20 ,",
    "we know that there are two edges rising from @xmath39 , labelled by @xmath355 and @xmath369 . these correspond to simple reflections @xmath370 and @xmath371 ( i.e. the tops of these edges are @xmath372 and @xmath373 where @xmath370 and @xmath371 are simple reflections . ) let @xmath374 be the subgroup of @xmath200 generated by @xmath370 and @xmath371 . then @xmath39 is the unique minimum - length representative of its left coset @xmath375 in @xmath200 .",
    "this coset appears in weak order on @xmath20 as an interval with minimum element @xmath39 .",
    "( for more details , see [ hu , section 1.10 ] . )",
    "this interval of @xmath20 is isomorphic to weak order on @xmath374 , which is a rank 2 reflection group .",
    "therefore , this interval consists of a two incomparable chains @xmath376 , together with a minimum element @xmath39 and a maximum element , which we will call @xmath377 .    observe that @xmath378 $ ] and @xmath379 $ ] .",
    "thus , their join , @xmath380 , which equals @xmath377 , lies in @xmath359 $ ] . since @xmath360>[d_1]$ ] , but @xmath381 , @xmath382\\ne [ q]$ ] . since @xmath383=[c_1]\\leq [ c_k]\\lessdot[q]=[w]$ ] , @xmath382=[y_{r-1}]$ ] .",
    "observe that the edge ( in weak order on @xmath20 ) from @xmath384 to @xmath377 is labelled by @xmath369 .",
    "thus , by lemma 11 , since @xmath385 $ ] and @xmath386 $ ] , @xmath387\\lessdot[w])=\\beta$ ] , and we have shown that @xmath51 is interpolating .",
    "it is clear that the @xmath67 form the increasing chain from @xmath8 to @xmath9 in @xmath208 , and thus they are left modular .",
    "we conclude that cambrian lattices of type @xmath1 are trim .",
    "the following theorem is an easy corollary of theorem 8 .",
    "the type @xmath0 cambrian lattices are trim .",
    "let @xmath207 be an oriented type @xmath0 coxeter diagram .",
    "let @xmath388 be the type @xmath1 coxeter diagram obtained by affixing an extra edge labelled 4 to @xmath12 , oriented arbitrarily .",
    "it is straightforward to see , either by the explicit description of cambrian lattices in types @xmath0 and @xmath1 , or from general theory , that @xmath208 is a lower interval in @xmath389 .",
    "( the top of the interval is the equivalence class of the longest word for the type @xmath0 coxeter group . )",
    "it now follows by theorem 1 that @xmath208 is trim .",
    "let @xmath200 be a finite reflection group which contains @xmath198 .",
    "let @xmath12 be its dynkin diagram , and @xmath207 an orientation .",
    "as in type @xmath1 , we can order the nodes of the diagram in accordance with the orientation of the edges , and then take the product of the simple reflections in that order , obtaining a coxeter element @xmath95 .",
    "if @xmath390 is the coxeter number for @xmath200 then , since @xmath391 , @xmath390 will be even , and @xmath392 , [ hu , corollary 3.20 ] .",
    "linearly order the roots of @xmath200 in the order in which they appear as inversions in the word for @xmath393 .",
    "let @xmath67 be the element of @xmath200 whose inversion set consists of the first @xmath65 roots , in this order .",
    "now , take the minimal quotient of @xmath200 such that the @xmath67 are all left modular .",
    "call this the pre - cambrian lattice associated to @xmath207 .",
    "the bottom elements of the fibres of this quotient will be exactly those elements whose inversion sets have @xmath236-good intersection with all rank 2 sub - root systems , where the order on the sub - root system comes from the linear order on the positive roots .",
    "( and similarly for the top elements of the fibres . )",
    "the pre - cambrian lattice associated to @xmath207 coincides with the cambrian lattice @xmath208 .",
    "note that we have already showed that these conjectures hold in type @xmath1 .",
    "since every root system embeds in one whose reflection group contains @xmath198 , and the cambrian lattice associated to the smaller root system appears as a lower interval in the cambrian lattice associated to the larger root system , it would follow from conjectures 2 and 3 that all cambrian lattices are trim .",
