    "neurons in the visual cortex form spatial representations or maps of several stimulus features . how are different spatial representations of visual information coordinated in the brain ? in this paper , we study the hypothesis that the coordinated organization of several visual cortical maps can be explained by joint optimization .",
    "previous attempts to explain the spatial layout of functional maps in the visual cortex proposed specific optimization principles ad hoc . here , we systematically analyze how optimization principles in a general class of models impact on the spatial layout of visual cortical maps . for each considered optimization principle",
    "we identify the corresponding optima and analyze their spatial layout .",
    "this directly demonstrates that by studying map layout and geometric inter - map correlations one can substantially constrain the underlying optimization principle .",
    "in particular , we study whether such optimization principles can lead to spatially complex patterns and to geometric correlations among cortical maps as observed in imaging experiments .",
    "neurons in the primary visual cortex are selective to a multidimensional set of visual stimulus features , including visual field position , contour orientation , ocular dominance , direction of motion , and spatial frequency @xcite . in many mammals ,",
    "these response properties form spatially complex , two - dimensional patterns called visual cortical maps @xcite . the functional advantage of a two dimensional mapping of stimulus selectivities is currently unknown @xcite . what determines the precise spatial organization of these maps ?",
    "it is a plausible hypothesis that natural selection should shape visual cortical maps to build efficient representations of visual information improving the fitness of the organism .",
    "cortical maps are therefore often viewed as optima of some cost function .",
    "for instance , it has been proposed that cortical maps optimize the cortical wiring length @xcite or represent an optimal compromise between stimulus coverage and map continuity @xcite .",
    "if map structure was largely genetically determined map structure might be optimized through genetic variation and darwinian selection on an evolutionary timescale .",
    "optimization may , however , also occur during the ontogenetic maturation of the individual organism for instance by the activity - dependent refinement of neuronal circuits .",
    "if such an activity - dependent refinement of cortical architecture realizes an optimization strategy its outcome should be interpreted as the convergence towards a ground state of a specific energy functional .",
    "this hypothesized optimized functional , however , remains currently unknown . as several different functional maps coexist in the visual cortex candidate energy functionals are expected to reflect the multiple response properties of neurons in the visual cortex .",
    "in fact , consistent with the idea of joint optimization of different feature maps cortical maps are not independent of each other @xcite .",
    "various studies proposed a coordinated optimization of different feature maps @xcite .",
    "coordinated optimization appears consistent with the observed distinct spatial relationships between different maps such as the tendency of iso - orientation lines to intersect od borders perpendicularly or the preferential positioning of orientation pinwheels at locations of maximal eye dominance @xcite .",
    "specifically these geometric correlations have thus been proposed to indicate the optimization of a cost function given by a compromise between stimulus coverage and continuity @xcite , a conclusion that was questioned by carreira - perpinan and goodhill @xcite .",
    "+ visual cortical maps are often spatially complex patterns that contain defect structures such as point singularities ( pinwheels ) @xcite or line discontinuities ( fractures ) @xcite and that never exactly repeat @xcite .",
    "it is conceivable that this spatial complexity arises from geometric frustration due to a coordinated optimization of multiple feature maps in which not all inter - map interactions can be simultaneously satisfied @xcite . in many optimization models , however , the resulting map layout is spatially not complex or lacks some of the basic features such as topological defects @xcite . in other studies coordinated optimization",
    "was reported to preserve defects that would otherwise decay @xcite .",
    "an attempt to rigorously study the hypothesis that the structure of cortical maps is explained by an optimization process thus raises a number of questions : i ) what are the genuine ground states of candidate energy functionals and how can they be calculated with precision and rigor ?",
    "ii ) how do differences in candidate optimization principles impact on the predicted map structure and conversely what can be learned about an hypothetical underlying optimization principle from observations on map structure ?",
    "iii ) is there a way to analyze the coordinated organization of cortical maps predicted by optimization principles in general ?",
    "if theoretical neuroscience was able to answer these questions with greater confidence , the interpretation and explanation of visual cortical architecture could build on a more solid foundation than currently available .",
    "to start laying such a foundation , we examined how symmetry principles in general constrain the form of optimization models and developed a formalism for analyzing map optimization independent of the specific energy functional assumed .",
    "+ minima of a given energy functional can be found by gradient descent which is naturally represented by a dynamical system describing a formal time evolution of the maps .",
    "response properties in visual cortical maps are arranged in repetitive modules of a typical spatial length called hypercolumn .",
    "optimization models that reproduce this typical length scale are therefore effectively pattern forming systems with a so - called cellular or finite wavelength instability , see @xcite .",
    "in the theory of pattern formation , it is well understood that symmetries play a crucial role @xcite .",
    "some symmetries are widely considered biologically plausible for cortical maps , for instance the invariance under spatial translations and rotations or a global shift of orientation preference @xcite . in this paper",
    "we argue that such symmetries and an approach that utilizes the analogy between map optimization and pattern forming systems can open up a novel and systematic approach to the coordinated optimization of visual cortical representations .",
    "+ a recent study found strong evidence for a common design in the functional architecture of orientation columns @xcite .",
    "three species , galagos , ferrets , and tree shrews , widely separated in evolution of modern mammals , share an apparently universal set of quantitative properties .",
    "the average pinwheel density as well as the spatial organization of pinwheels within orientation hypercolumns , expressed in the statistics of nearest neighbors as well as the local variability of the pinwheel densities in cortical subregions ranging from 1 to 30 hypercolumns , are found to be virtually identical in the analyzed species .",
    "however , these quantities are different from random maps .",
    "intriguingly , the average pinwheel density was found to be statistical indistinguishable from the mathematical constant @xmath0 up to a precision of 2% .",
    "such apparently universal laws can be reproduced in relatively simple self - organization models if long - range neuronal interactions are dominant @xcite . as pointed out by kaschube and coworkers ,",
    "these findings pose strong constraints on models of cortical functional architecture @xcite .",
    "many models exhibiting pinwheel annihilation @xcite or pinwheel crystallization @xcite were found to violate the experimentally observed layout rules . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the common design is correctly predicted in models that were based only on intrinsic op properties . alternatively , however , it is conceivable that they result from geometric frustration due to inter - map interactions and joint optimization . in the current study",
    "we therefore in particular examined whether the coordinated optimization of the op map and another feature map can reproduce the quantitative laws defining the common design .",
    "+ the presentation of our results is organized as follows .",
    "first we introduce a formalism to model the coordinated optimization of complex and real valued scalar fields .",
    "complex valued fields can represent for instance orientation preference ( op ) or direction preference maps @xcite .",
    "real valued fields may represent for instance ocular dominance ( od ) @xcite , spatial frequency maps @xcite or on - off segregation @xcite .",
    "we construct several optimization models such that an independent optimization of each map in isolation results in a regular op stripe pattern and , depending on the relative representations of the two eyes , od patterns with a regular hexagonal or stripe layout .",
    "a model - free , symmetry - based analysis of potential optimization principles that couple the real and complex valued fields provides a comprehensive classification and parametrization of conceivable coordinated optimization models and identifies representative forms of coupling energies . for analytical treatment of the optimization problem",
    "we adapt a perturbation method from pattern formation theory called weakly nonlinear analysis @xcite .",
    "this method is applicable to models in which the spatial pattern of columns branches off continuously from an unselective homogeneous state . it reduces the dimensionality of the system and leads to amplitude equations as an approximate description of the system near the symmetry breaking transition at which the homogeneous state becomes unstable .",
    "we identify a limit in which inter - map interactions that are formally always bidirectional become effectively unidirectional . in this limit",
    ", one can neglect the backreaction of the complex map on the layout of the co - evolving scalar feature map .",
    "we show how to treat low and higher order versions of inter - map coupling energies which enter at different order in the perturbative expansion .",
    "+ second we apply the derived formalism by calculating optima of two representative low order examples of coordinated optimization models and examine how they impact on the resulting map layout .",
    "two higher order optimization models are analyzed in text s1 . for concreteness and",
    "motivated by recent topical interest @xcite , we illustrate the coordinated optimization of visual cortical maps for the widely studied example of a complex op map and a real feature map such as the od map .",
    "op maps are characterized by pinwheels , regions in which columns preferring all possible orientations are organized around a common center in a radial fashion @xcite . in particular , we address the problem of pinwheel stability in op maps @xcite and calculate the pinwheel densities predicted by different models .",
    "as shown previously , many theoretical models of visual cortical development and optimization fail to predict op maps possessing stable pinwheels @xcite .",
    "we show that in case of the low order energies , a strong inter - map coupling will typically lead to op map suppression , causing the orientation selectivity of all neurons to vanish .",
    "for all considered optimization models , we identify stationary solutions of the resulting dynamics and mathematically demonstrate their stability .",
    "we further calculate phase diagrams as a function of the inter - map coupling strength and the amount of overrepresentation of certain stimuli of the co - evolving scalar feature map .",
    "we show that the optimization of any of the analyzed coupling energies can lead to spatially relatively complex patterns",
    ". moreover , in case of op maps , these patterns are typically pinwheel - rich .",
    "the phase diagrams , however , differ for each considered coupling energy , in particular leading to coupling energy specific ground states .",
    "we therefore thoroughly analyze the spatial layout of energetic ground states and in particular their geometric inter - map relationships .",
    "we find that none of the examined models reproduces the experimentally observed pinwheel density and spatially aperiodic arrangements .",
    "our analysis identifies a seemingly general condition for interaction induced pinwheel - rich op optima namely a substantial bias in the response properties of the co - evolving scalar feature map .      in case of the low order inter - map coupling energies",
    "strong inter - map coupling leads to a suppression of op selectivity .",
    "this suppressive effect can be avoided by restricting coupling strengths .",
    "one aim of this article is to test different optimization principles and potentially rule out some optimization principles .",
    "when comparing our results from different optimization principles to biological data such parameter tuning reduces the practicability . in this supporting information we complement our study using the high order inter - map coupling energies .",
    "we show that in this case a suppression of op selectivity can not occur .",
    "we derive coupled amplitude equations which , however , involve several mathematical assumptions .",
    "a systematic treatment as it is shown in the main article would imply that low order and higher order inter - map coupling energies are in general non - zero .",
    "low order energy terms would enter at third order in the expansion and higher order corrections could potentially alter the stability properties .",
    "in addition , higher order inter - map coupling energies can affect the stability of patterns .",
    "in the following , we assume all low order inter - map coupling energies to be zero and that contributions entering the amplitude equations at higher orders can be neglected .",
    "the obtained results are confirmed numerically in part ( ii ) of this study .",
    "we model the response properties of neuronal populations in the visual cortex by two - dimensional scalar order parameter fields which are either complex valued or real valued @xcite .",
    "a complex valued field @xmath1 can for instance describe op or direction preference of a neuron located at position @xmath2 .",
    "a real valued field @xmath3 can describe for instance od or the spatial frequency preference .",
    "although we introduce a model for the coordinated optimization of general real and complex valued order parameter fields we consider @xmath1 as the field of op and @xmath3 as the field of od throughout this article . in this case , the pattern of preferred stimulus orientation @xmath4 is obtained by @xmath5 the modulus @xmath6 is a measure of the selectivity at cortical location @xmath2 .",
    "+ op maps are characterized by so - called _ pinwheels _ , regions in which columns preferring all possible orientations are organized around a common center in a radial fashion .",
    "the centers of pinwheels are point discontinuities of the field @xmath7 where the mean orientation preference of nearby columns changes by 90 degrees .",
    "pinwheels can be characterized by a topological charge @xmath8 which indicates in particular whether the orientation preference increases clockwise or counterclockwise around the pinwheel center , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a closed curve around a single pinwheel center at @xmath11 . since @xmath4 is a cyclic variable in the interval",
    "@xmath12 $ ] and up to isolated points is a continuous function of @xmath2 , @xmath13 can only have values @xmath14 where @xmath15 is an integer number @xcite .",
    "if its absolute value @xmath16 , each orientation is represented only once in the vicinity of a pinwheel center . in experiments , only pinwheels with a topological charge of @xmath17 are observed , which are simple zeros of the field @xmath1 .",
    "+ od maps can be described by a real valued two - dimensional field @xmath3 , where @xmath18 indicates ipsilateral eye dominance and @xmath19 contralateral eye dominance of the neuron located at position @xmath2 .",
    "the magnitude indicates the strength of the eye dominance and thus the zeros of the field correspond to the borders of od .",
    "+ in this article , we view visual cortical maps as optima of some energy functional @xmath20 .",
    "the time evolution of these maps can be described by the gradient descent of this energy functional .",
    "the field dynamics thus takes the form @xmath21 \\nonumber \\\\ \\partial_t \\ , o(\\mathbf{x},t ) & = & g[z(\\mathbf{x},t),o(\\mathbf{x},t ) ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 $ ] and @xmath23 $ ] are nonlinear operators given by @xmath22=-\\frac{\\delta e}{\\delta \\overline{z}}$ ] , @xmath23=-\\frac{\\delta e}{\\delta o}$ ] .",
    "the system then relaxes towards the minima of the energy @xmath20 .",
    "the convergence of this dynamics towards an attractor is assumed to represent the process of maturation and optimization of the cortical circuitry .",
    "various biologically detailed models have been cast to this form @xcite .",
    "+ all visual cortical maps are arranged in repetitive patterns of a typical wavelength @xmath24 .",
    "we splitted the energy functional @xmath20 into a part that ensures the emergence of such a typical wavelength for each map and into a part which describes the coupling among different maps .",
    "a well studied model reproducing the emergence of a typical wavelength by a pattern forming instability is of the swift - hohenberg type @xcite .",
    "many other pattern forming systems occurring in different physical , chemical , and biological contexts ( see for instance @xcite ) have been cast into a dynamics of this type .",
    "its dynamics in case of the op map is of the form @xmath25 with the linear swift - hohenberg operator @xmath26 @xmath27 , and @xmath28 $ ] a nonlinear operator .",
    "the energy functional of this dynamics is given by @xmath29 in fourier representation , @xmath30 is diagonal with the spectrum @xmath31 the spectrum exhibits a maximum at @xmath32.for @xmath33 , all modes are damped since @xmath34 and only the homogeneous state @xmath35 is stable .",
    "this is no longer the case for @xmath36 when modes on the _ critical circle _ @xmath32 acquire a positive growth rate and now start to grow , resulting in patterns with a typical wavelength @xmath37 .",
    "thus , this model exhibits a supercritical bifurcation where the homogeneous state looses its stability and spatial modulations start to grow .",
    "+ the coupled dynamics we considered is of the form @xmath38 where @xmath39 , and @xmath40 is a constant . to account for the species differences in the wavelengths of the pattern we chose two typical wavelengths @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",

    "using a phenomenological approach the inclusion and exclusion of various terms has to be strictly justified .",
    "we did this by symmetry considerations .",

    "such an inversion symmetry breaking could also arise from quadratic terms such as @xmath47 . in the methods section",
    "we detail how a constant shift in the field @xmath3 can eliminate the constant term and generate such a quadratic term . including either a shift or a quadratic term thus already represents the most general case .",
    "the inter - map coupling energy @xmath45 was assumed to be invariant under this inversion .",
    "otherwise orientation selective neurons would , for an equal representation of the two eyes , develop different layouts to inputs from the left or the right eye .",
    "the primary visual cortex shows no anatomical indication that there are any prominent regions or directions parallel to the cortical layers @xcite . besides invariance under translations @xmath48 and rotations @xmath49 of both maps we required that the dynamics should be invariant under orientation shifts @xmath50",
    "note , that the assumption of shift symmetry is an idealization that uncouples the op map from the map of visual space .",
    "bressloff and coworkers have presented arguments that euclidean symmetry that couples spatial locations to orientation shift represents a more plausible symmetry for visual cortical dynamics @xcite , see also @xcite . the existence of orientation shift symmetry , however , is not an all or none question .",

    "further support for the potential relevance of this picture comes from experiments in which the od map was artificially removed resulting apparently in a significantly smoother op map @xcite . in this context",

    "( [ fig : constsolutions ] ) . here , od domains form bands in the binocular region and a system of ipsilateral eye patches at the transition zone to the monocular region where the contralateral eye gradually becomes more dominant .",

    "+ * the geometry of interaction induced pinwheel crystals * + one important general observation from our results is that map organization was often not inferable by simple qualitative considerations on the energy functional .",
    "the organization of interaction induced hexagonal pinwheel crystals reveals that the relation between coupling energy and resulting map structure is quite complex and often counter intuitive .",
    "we analyzed the stationary patterns with respect to intersection angles and pinwheel positions . in all models ,",
    "intersection angles of iso - orientation lines and od borders have a tendency towards perpendicular angles whether the energy term mathematically depends on this angle , as for the gradient - type energies , or not , as for the product - type energies .",

    "mathematically , these phenomena result from the complex interplay between the single map energies and the interaction energies . in case of the low order gradient - type inter - map coupling energy all pinwheels",
    "are located at od extrema , as expected from the used coupling energy . for other analyzed coupling energies , however , the remaining pinwheels are located either at od saddle - points ( low order product - type energy ) or near od borders ( higher order gradient - type energy ) , in contrast to the expection that od extrema should be energetically preferred .",

    "+ we examined the impact of different interaction energies on the structure of local minima and ground states of models for the coordinated optimization of a complex and a real scalar feature map such as op and od maps .",

    "in particular , the complex scalar map without interactions would form a periodic stripe pattern without any phase singularity . in all models ,",
    "increasing the strength of interactions could eventually stabilize qualitatively different more complex and biologically more realistic patterns containing pinwheels that can become the energetic ground states for strong enough inter - map interactions .",
    "the way in which this happens provides fundamental insights into the relationships between map structure and energy functionals in optimization models for visual cortical functional architecture .",
    "+ our results demonstrate that the structure of maps shaped by inter - map interactions is in principle informative about the type of coupling energy . the organization of the complex scalar map that optimizes the joined energy functional was in general different for all different types of coupling terms examined .",
    "we identified a class of hpwc solutions which become stable for large inter - map coupling .",
    "this class depends on a single parameter which is specific to the used inter - map coupling energy .",
    "furthermore , as shown in text s1 , pinwheel positions in rpwcs , tracked while increasing inter - map coupling strength , were different for different coupling terms examined and thus could in principle serve as a trace of the underlying optimization principle .",
    "this demonstrates that , although pinwheel stabilization is not restricted to a particular choice of the interaction term , each analyzed phase diagram is specific to the used coupling energy . in particular , in the strong coupling regime substantial information can be obtained from a detailed inspection of solutions .",
    "+ in the case of the product - type coupling energies , the resulting phase diagrams are relatively complex as stationary solutions and stability borders depend on the magnitude of the od bias . here , even quantitative values of model parameters can in principle be constrained by analysis of the map layout .",
    "in contrast , for the gradient - type coupling energies , the bias dependence can be absorbed into the coupling strength and only selects the stationary od pattern .",
    "this leads to relatively simple phase diagrams . for these models",
    "map layout is thus uninformative of quantitative model parameters .",
    "we identified several biologically very implausible op patterns .",
    "in the case of the product - type energies , we found orientation scotoma solutions which are selective to only two preferred orientations . in the case of the low order gradient - type energy , we found op patterns containing pinwheels with a topological charge of 1 which have not yet been observed in experiments .",
    "if the relevant terms in the coupling energy could be determined by other means , the parameter regions in which these patterns occur could be used to constrain model parameters by theoretical bounds .",
    "+ the information provided by map structure overall appears qualitative rather than quantitative . in both low order inter - map coupling energies ( and the gradient - type higher order coupling energy ,",
    "see text s1 ) , hpwc patterns resulting from strong interactions were fixed , not exhibiting any substantial dependence on the precise choice of interaction coefficient . in principle , the spatial organization of stimulus preferences in a map is an infinite dimensional object that could sensitively depend in distinct ways to a large number of model parameters .",
    "it is thus not a trivial property that this structure often gives essentially no information about the value of coupling constants in our models .",
    "the situation , however , is reversed when considering the structure of rpwcs .",
    "these solutions exist and are stable although energetically not favored in the absence of inter - map interactions .",
    "some of their pinwheel positions continuously depend on the strength of inter - map interactions . these solutions and",
    "their parameter dependence nevertheless are also largely uninformative about the nature of the interaction energy .",
    "this results from the fact that rpwcs are fundamentally uncoupled system solutions that are only modified by the inter - map interaction . as pointed out before , preferentially orthogonal intersection angles between iso - orientation lines and od borders appear to be a general feature of coordinated optimization models in the strong coupling regime .",
    "although the detailed form of the intersection angle histogram is solution and thus model specific , our analysis does not corroborate attempts to use this feature to support specific optimization principles , see also @xcite .",
    "the stabilization of pinwheel crystals for strong inter - map coupling appears to be universal and provides per se no specific information about the underlying optimization principle .",
    "in fact , the general structure of the amplitude equations is universal and only the coupling coefficients change when changing the coupling energy .",
    "it is thus expected that also for other coupling energies , respecting the proposed set of symmetries , pwc solutions can become stable for large enough inter - map coupling .",
    "+ * conclusions * + our analysis conclusively demonstrates that od segregation can stabilize pinwheels and induce pinwheel - rich optima in models for the coordinated optimization of op and od maps when pinwheels are intrinsically unstable in the uncoupled dynamics of the op map .",
    "this allows to systematically assess the possibility that inter - map coupling might be the mechanism of pinwheel stabilization in the visual cortex .",
    "the analytical approach developed here is independent of details of specific optimization principles and thus allowed to systematically analyze how different optimization principles impact on map layout .",
