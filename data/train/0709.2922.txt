    "the first three extrasolar planets @xcite was discovered around a millisecond pulsar , psr b1257 + 12 , with spin period of @xmath3 ms .",
    "dispersion measure shows a distance of about 500 pc to pulsar , and x - ray spectrum reveals a hydrogen column density of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the parameters of the three planets are listed in table 1 .",
    ".parameters of psr b1257 + 12 s planets : orbital period @xmath5 , mass @xmath6 , orbital radii @xmath7 @xcite , mass from this work @xmath8 , and orbital radii from this work @xmath9 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     a recent observation has , however , shown that the millisecond pulsar b1257 + 12 could have very small x - ray emitting area , only about 2000 m@xmath0 @xcite , which is remarkably smaller than the expected value assuming a pulsar with @xmath10 km .",
    "the observation covered 20 ks and received 25 photons . both power law and blackbody models are acceptable .",
    "the blackbody fitting gives : @xmath11 kev and projected emitting area @xmath12 m@xmath0 .",
    "the bolometric luminosity is @xmath13 @xcite .    for a pulsar with @xmath14 km and @xmath3 ms ,",
    "the polar cap area is @xmath15 , nearly four orders higher than the fitted area ( @xmath12 m@xmath0 ) . in this article",
    ", we will demonstrate that this discrepancy could be explained by assuming that psr b1257 + 12 is a low - mass quark star ( qs , for a general review , please see  @xcite in this proceedings ) .",
    "the precessing radio pulsar , psr b1828 - 11 , could also be a low - mass qs torqued by a quark planet orbiting around  @xcite .",
    "we discuss the possibility of planet formation under this new scenario , that differs from the models in which psr b1257 + 12 is a normal neutron star of @xmath16 .",
    "for a pulsar of @xmath17 km and @xmath3 ms , the theoretical value of the polar cap area is @xmath18 ( where @xmath19 is the light speed ) , which is @xmath20 times larger than the observation .",
    "we consider that psr b1257 + 12 is a low - mass quark star .",
    "its radius is @xmath21 km to fit the observed emitting area @xmath22 m@xmath0 .",
    "hence , the mass of the quark star is @xmath23 .",
    "consequently , the planet s parameters such as the masses and distances to the central pulsar ( according to the third keplerian law ) would be changed , @xmath24 through the third keplerian law , we can obtain that @xmath25 .",
    "however , the orbital radius of the pulsar ( @xmath26 ) should not depend on @xmath27 ( or @xmath28 ) , so as to have the same time residue of pulse toa ( time of arrival ) as the @xmath29 case .",
    "so we have @xmath30 .",
    "the new values , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , are presented in table 1 .",
    "we also show in fig .",
    "1 the the masses ( @xmath6 ) and the orbital radii ( @xmath7 ) of the planets as functions of polar cap area ( @xmath33 ) .        small star radius would induce smaller potential drop @xmath34 in the polar cap region .",
    "the potential drop @xmath34 should be larger than a critical value @xmath35 ( @xmath36 v ) in order to make a quark star manifest as a radio pulsar @xcite .",
    "considering the effects of inclination angle @xcite , the potential drop @xmath34 in the polar cap region be as larger than @xmath37 v if the inclination angle @xmath38 is between @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "how the central low - mass quark star form ?",
    "how the planets form ?",
    "we propose two possible scenarios for this pulsar - planets system :    * a low - mass quark star and three quark planets .",
    "such a system may form after collision of quark stars , and the quark planets could also be ejected during supernovae explosion of quark star formation  @xcite . * a low - mass quark star and three normal planets .",
    "such a system may form through accretion induced collapse ( aic ) process of white dwarfs @xcite or a quark nova explosion @xcite .",
    "the planets could probably from in the fallback disk that forms after the collapse .",
    "the low - mass quark star model has advantage for planet formation since it has low x - ray luminosity ( the disk is cool and the effect of planet evaporation is thus weak ) .",
    "the cooling time scale for the central star is @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the stellar volume and @xmath43 is the stellar surface area .",
    "a low - mass quark star has smaller radius and cools more rapidly than a normal neutron star of @xmath17 km .",
    "so the x - ray luminosity decrease in a shorter time scale .",
    "this may make it easier for disk to form and hence planets formation .",
    "the observation could be fitted by both blackbody and power law function @xcite . due to the small number of photons , it is hard to distinguish these two type of models .",
    "we assume that the emission is blackbody in our calculation .",
    "if there is power law component in the emission , the blackbody part would be smaller .",
    "thus , the central star should be even smaller .",
    "pulsar 1257 + 12 could possibly be a low - mass quark star ( with three planets ) of @xmath44 km if its x - ray luminosity is from the polar caps . in this case",
    "the mass of the planets would be smaller by a factor of 0.0036 .",
    "the planets around the low - mass quark star may form in the fallback disk after an aic process / a quark nova explosion , through a collision of quark stars , or as the ejecta during quark star formation .",
