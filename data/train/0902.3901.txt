    "the prediction of a possible existence of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) created in the relativistic heavy ion collisions is one of the most interesting theoretical achievements of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) at non - zero temperatures and densities .",
    "a fairly full list of the relevant pioneering papers is given in @xcite ) and the present status of the investigations of the properties of qcd matter is described in @xcite .    the equation of state ( eos ) for the qgp has been derived analytically up to the order @xmath3 by using the perturbation theory ( pt ) expansion for the evaluation of the corresponding thermodynamic potential term by term ( @xcite and references therein ) . however , the most characteristic feature of the thermal pt expansion is its non - analytical dependence on the coupling constant @xmath4 , which means that pt qcd is not applicable at finite temperatures .",
    "the problem is not the poor convergence of this series @xcite but rather the fact that a radius of convergence can not even be defined ; any next calculated term can be bigger than the previous one .",
    "this is an in - principle problem which can not be overcome . from the strictly mathematical point of view",
    ", four - dimensional qcd at non - zero temperatures effectively becomes a three - dimensional theory . at the same time , three - dimensional qcd has more severe infrared singularities @xcite and its coupling constant becomes dimensional .",
    "it is as a consequence of this that the dependence becomes non - analytical when using the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath4 .",
    "one also needs to introduce three different scales , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , where @xmath5 is the temperature , in order to try somehow to understand the dynamics of the qgp within the thermal pt qcd approach .    at present , the only practical method to investigate the problem is lattice qcd at finite temperature and baryon density , which has recently shown rapid progress ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , lattice qcd , being a very specific regularization scheme , is primary aimed at obtaining well - defined corresponding expressions in order to get realistic numbers for physical quantities .",
    "one may therefore get numbers and curves without understanding what the physics is behind them .",
    "such understanding can only come from the dynamical theory , which is continuous qcd .",
    "for example , any description of the qgp has to be formulated within the framework of a dynamical theory .",
    "the need for an analytical eos remains , but , of course , it should be essentially non - perturbative ( np ) , approaching the so - called stefan - boltzmann ( sb ) limit only at very hight temperatures . thus the approaches of analytic np qcd and lattice qcd to finite - temperature qcd",
    "do not exclude each other , but , on the contrary , should be complementary .",
    "this is especially true at low temperatures where the thermal qcd lattice calculations suffer from big uncertainties @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", any analytic np approach has to correctly reproduce thermal lattice qcd results at high temperatures ( see papers cited above ) .",
    "there already exist interesting analytical approaches based on quasi - particle picture @xcite ( and references therein ) to analyze results of @xmath0 lattice qcd calculations for the qgp eos .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to derive the np analytical eos for the gluon matter ( gm ) , i.e. , a system consisting purely of yang - mills ( ym ) fields without quark degrees of freedom .",
    "the formalism we use to generalize it to non - zero temperatures is the effective potential approach for composite operators @xcite . in the absence of external sources",
    "it is nothing but the vacuum energy density ( ved ) .",
    "the approach is np from the very beginning , since it deals with the expansion of the corresponding skeleton vacuum loop diagrams .",
    "the key element is the extension of our initial work @xcite to non - zero temperatures .",
    "this makes it possible to introduce the temperature - dependent bag constant ( pressure ) as a function of the mass gap .",
    "it is this which is responsible for the large - scale structure of the qcd ground state .",
    "the confining dynamics in the gm will therefore be nontrivially taken into account directly through the mass gap and via the temperature - dependent bag constant itself , but other np effects will be also present .",
    "let us note that the temperature - dependent bag constant within the thermal pt qcd has been introduced into the gibbs equilibrium criteria for a phase transition @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the effective potential approach has been already used in order to study the structure of qcd at very large baryon density for an arbitrary number of flavors @xcite .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "the effective potential approach for composite operators is discussed in general terms .",
    "an explicit expression is obtained for the ved for pure ym fields . in section 3 the expression for the gluon pressure",
    "is derived taking into account the expression for the bag constant at zero temperature as a function of the mass gap @xcite .",
    "taken together this makes it possible to derive a formula for the pressure that is suitable for the generalization to non - zero temperatures .",
    "this consists of the two independent parts , describing the np and pt contributions to the gluon pressure . in section 4 the generalization to non - zero temperatures",
    "is performed using the imaginary - time formalism .",
    "all the analytic results for the gluon pressure as a function of temperature are collected together in section 5 . in section 6",
    "the expressions are given for the main thermodynamic quantities , such as the entropy and energy densities , the heat capacity , etc .",
    ", as functions of the pressure .",
    "in section 7 we discuss all the numerical results for the np part of the gluon pressure .",
    "section 8 concludes our discussion .",
    "some explicit expressions for the summation of the thermal logarithms over the matsubara frequencies are present in appendix a , while in appendix b a scale - setting scheme of our calculations is formulated .",
    "the quantum part of the ved is determined by the effective potential approach for composite operators @xcite .",
    "it is given in the form of the skeleton loops expansion , containing all the types of the qcd full propagators and vertices ( for its pictorial representation , see @xcite ) .",
    "each vacuum skeleton loop is itself a sum of an infinite number of the corresponding pt vacuum loops ( i.e. , containing the point - like vertices and free propagators ) .",
    "thus the effective potential approach makes it possible to calculate the ved from first principles , i.e. , using only fundamental constituents of qcd : gluons and quarks and their interactions or , more precisely , their propagators and vertices of their interactions .",
    "the number of the vacuum skeleton loops is equal to the power of the planck constant , @xmath8 , so that a series expansion for the effective potential is nothing other than the semiclassical wkb loop expansion , which , in general , is an asymptotic series .",
    "it has been widely used in quantum field theory @xcite . in qcd the instantons",
    "have been discovered by using just this method @xcite ( and references therein ) .",
    "it is instructive to begin with some general expressions at zero temperature in this formalism .",
    "the gluon part of the ved to leading order ( the so - called log - loop level @xmath9 , whose infinite series is shown in fig .",
    "1 ) is analytically given by the effective potential for composite operators @xcite as follows :    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the full gluon propagator and @xmath12 is its free counterpart .",
    "the traces over space - time and color group indices are assumed .",
    "it is clear from this that the effective potential is normalized to the free pt vacuum to be zero , i.e. , @xmath13 .",
    "we note that the ym bag constant has been calculated to this order in @xcite .",
    "the two - point green s function , describing the full gluon propagator , is    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the gauge - fixing parameter and    @xmath16    its free counterpart @xmath17 is obtaining by replacing the full gluon propagator s lorentz structure @xmath18 in eq .",

    "the ved @xmath25 derived in eq .",
    "( 6 ) is already a colorless ( color - singlet ) quantity , since it has been summed over the color indices .",
    "it also does not depend explicitly on the unphysical ( longitudinal ) part of the full gluon propagator due to the product @xmath26 which , in turn , comes from the above - mentioned normalization of the free pt vacuum to zero .",
    "thus it is worth emphasizing that only the transversal ( `` physical '' ) degrees of freedom only of the gauge bosons contribute to this equation . as a consequence , in the effective potential approach to leading order",
    "there is no need for the ghost degrees of freedom from the very beginning in order to cancel the longitudinal ( `` unphysical '' ) component of the full gluon propagator .",
    "this role is played by the normalization condition . however , this does not work for the higher order vacuum skeleton loops .",
    "in this case and beyond the pt at any gauge ( i.e. , in the general case ) the cancelation of unphysical gluon modes should proceed with the help of ghosts @xcite .",
    "an overall numerical factor @xmath27 has been introduced into eq .",

( 5 ) and ( 6 ) ) .    in what follows the lorentz structure @xmath31 will be called the full effective charge ( `` running '' ) or the gluon propagator invariant function ( its form factor ) , for convenience . for the generalization of eq .",
    "( 6 ) to non - zero temperatures , the most important thing is to introduce correctly the above - mentioned bag constant .",
    "the vacuum of qcd is a very complicated confining medium and its dynamical and topological complexity means that its structure can be organized at various levels : classical and quantum ( see , for example @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is mainly np by origin , character and magnitude , since the corresponding fine structure constant is large .",
    "however , the virtual gluon field configurations and excitations of the pt magnitude due to asymptotic freedom ( af ) @xcite are also present there .",
    "one of the main dynamical characteristics of the true qcd ground state is the bag constant @xmath32 .",
    "its name has come from the famous bag models for hadrons @xcite , but its present understanding ( and thus modern definition ) has nothing to do with the hadron properties .",
    "it is defined as the difference between the pt and the np veds @xcite .",
    "we can symbolically write @xmath33 , where the @xmath34 is np but `` contaminated '' by the pt contributions ( i.e. , this is a full @xmath34 like a full gluon propagator ) . rewriting @xmath32 as @xmath35 = ved^{pt } - [ ved^{tnp } + ved^{pt } ] = - ved^{tnp }",
    "> 0 $ ] , since the ved is always negative .",
    "the bag constant is nothing but the truly np ( tnp ) ved , apart from the sign , by definition , and thus is free of the pt contributions ( `` contaminations '' ) . in order to consider it also as a physical characteristic of the true qcd ground state ,",
    "the bag constant correctly calculated should satisfy some other requirements such as colorlessness and dependence on the physical degrees of freedom , finiteness , gauge - independence , no imaginary part ( stable vacuum ) , etc .    in our previous work @xcite",
    ", we have already derived an expression for the bag constant , which satisfies the above conditions :    @xmath36 - { 3 \\over 4 } d^{tnp}(q^2 ) \\right],\\ ] ]    where symbolically shown @xmath37 is the effective scale squared , separating the soft momenta from the hard ones in the integration over @xmath24 .",
    "this is a general expression for any tnp effective charge in order to calculate the bag constant from first principles .",
    "it is defined as the special function of the tnp effective charge integrated out over the np region ( soft momenta region , @xmath38 ) .",
    "adding the bag constant to the both sides of eq .",
    "( 6 ) , and introducing the gluon pressure @xmath39 , one obtains    @xmath40 - { 3 \\over 4}d(q^2 ) + a \\right].\\ ] ]    the next step is to establish the relation between the full effective charge @xmath41 and its tnp counterpart @xmath42 . in our previous work",
    "@xcite it has been proven that the full effective charge depends explicitly and regularly on the scale @xmath43 ( the so - called mass gap ) responsible for the np dynamics in qcd , i.e. , @xmath44 .",
    "the above - mentioned symbolic subtraction at the fundamental gluon level can then be defined as @xcite : @xmath45 . in this way",
    "the separation between the tnp effective charge and its pt counterpart becomes exact , but not unique . on how to make this separation exact and unique at the same time",
    "see subsection below . evidently , both the tnp part and its pt counterpart are valid throughout the whole energy / momentum range , i.e , they are not asymptotics .",
    "let us also emphasize the principle difference between @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the former is the np quantity `` contaminated '' by pt contributions , while the latter one , being also np , is free of them .",
    "however , this is not the whole story yet .",
    "since the pt part @xmath46 contains the free gluon lorentz structure @xmath47 , it should be extracted explicitly as follows , where we have dropped the explicit dependence on @xmath43 :    @xmath48    and @xmath49 describes the part responsible for af in the pt gluon effective charge .",
    "this procedure is necessary in order to maintain the normalization of the free pt vacuum to zero . in this connection ,",
    "let us stress that the second equality in this relation does not imply any violation of af in the full gluon effective charge @xmath41 , provided by the pt effective charge @xmath46 in the first equality of the same relation .",
    "extracting @xmath50 explicitly , we thereby subtract the divergent contribution associated with the constant @xmath51 in eq .",

    "the only problem remaining is the explicit expression for the tnp effective charge .",
    "evidently , it has to be consistent with our initial work @xcite , where the bag constant was evaluated at zero temperature , i.e. ,    @xmath64    where the superscript `` inp '' stands for the intrinsically np effective charge .",
    "here @xmath65 is the jaffe - witten ( jw ) mass gap , mentioned above , which is responsible for the large - scale structure of the qcd vacuum , and thus for its inp dynamics @xcite .",
    "let us note that how the mass gap appears in qcd has been shown in our work @xcite .",
    "a few additional remarks are in order .",
    "in @xcite it has been shown that the tnp part of the full gluon propagator as a function of the mass gap also contains a term that is regular at origin .",
    "it is for this reason that it is not uniquely separated from the pt gluon propagator , which effective charge that is always regular at origin .",
    "we distinguish between the inp and the pt effective charges not only by the presence of the mass gap , but by the character of the ir singularities as well @xcite . so only after the replacement ( 13 ) the inp effective charge is uniquely and exactly separated from its pt counterpart , and the obtained expression for the bag constant ( 7 ) becomes now _",
    "free of all the types of the pt contributions ( `` contaminations'')_.    in @xcite we have shown that the so - called inp gluon propagator is , by construction , purely transversal in a gauge invariant way .",
    "it exactly converges to the gluon propagator , whose effective charge is eq .",
    "( 13 ) , after the renormalization programme of the regularized mass gap is performed .",
    "this result has been obtained in the most general way , i.e. , without making any truncations / approximations / assumptions or choosing a special gauge .",
    "_ hence the expression ( 13 ) is not an ansatz , and thus it is mathematically well justified_. however , it should also be physically well justified .",
    "the problem is that the gluon equation of motion is highly nonlinear , so the number of independent exact solutions is not fixed @xmath66 ( this number may be even bigger , depending on the different truncations / approximations / assumptions and the concrete gauge choice made ) . they should be considered on equal footing from the very beginning . in our previous work @xcite , at least the two different general types of exact solutions for the full gluon propagator have been found as a function of the regularized mass gap : the first is smooth at small gluon momentum , allowing for the gluons to acquire an effective gluon mass ( the so - called massive solution ) .",
    "the second is singular in the @xmath67 limit , so that the gluons always remain massless ( the so - called nonlinear iteration solution ) .",
    "only this solution has an affective charge ( 13 ) after the renormalization is completed . for the detailed arguments which makes its choice justified from the physical point of view as well ( i.e. , emphasizing its confining nature ) see our paper @xcite .",
    "in addition , let us note that the above - mentioned massive solution is not confining .",
    "in the imaginary - time formalism @xcite , all the four - dimensional integrals can be easily generalized to non - zero temperatures @xmath5 according to the prescription ( note that there is already euclidean signature )    @xmath68    i.e. , each integral over @xmath69 of a loop momentum is to be replaced by the sum over the matsubara frequencies labeled by @xmath70 , which obviously assumes the replacement @xmath71 for bosons ( gluons ) . in frequency - momentum space",

    "we do not expect any serious changes in the behavior of their full counterparts in this region .",

    "it is worth emphasizing once more that all these np gluonic excitations are of dynamical origin , and only such can be accounted for within our approach . whether the pt part ( 33 ) of the gluon pressure ( 29 ) will introduce a new massless or even massive gluonic excitations ( or , equivalently , an effective gluonic degrees of freedom @xcite ) is an open question at this stage . in our opinion , however , they may be really present in the full gm eos .",

    "<S> the effective potential approach for composite operators is generalized to non - zero temperatures in order to derive the equation of state for pure @xmath0 yang - mills fields . in the absence of external sources , </S>",
    "<S> this is nothing but the vacuum energy density . </S>",
    "<S> the key element of this derivation is the introduction of a temperature dependence into the expression for the bag constant . </S>",
    "<S> the non - perturbative analytical equation of state for gluon matter does not depend on the coupling constant , but instead introduces a dependence on the mass gap . </S>",
    "<S> this is responsible for the large - scale structure of the qcd ground state . </S>",
    "<S> the important thermodynamic quantities , such as the pressure , energy and entropy densities , etc . , have been calculated . </S>",
    "<S> we show explicitly that the pressure may vary continuously around @xmath1 , whereas all other thermodynamic quantities undergo drastic changes at this point . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed analytical approach makes it possible to control for the first time the thermodynamics of gluon matter at low temperatures , below @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we reproduce the properties of the so - called `` fuzzy bag''-type models through the presence of the mass gap in our equation of state . </S>",
    "<S> an analytic calculation of the gluon condensate is obtained as a function of temperature . </S>"
