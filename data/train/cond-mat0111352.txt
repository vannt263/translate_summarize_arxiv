    "the interest in the mixed perovskites@xcite la@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 has been renewed @xcite in connection with the discovery of colossal magnetoresistance for @xmath18 .",
    "@xcite for the high doping range with @xmath19 , the mn@xmath20 @xmath21 electrons become localized at low temperatures with a concomitant anisotropic bond reorganization in the oxygen environment of the manganeses .",
    "this cooperative atomic rearrangement can change the symmetry or not , depending upon the particular electronic concentration , orbital occupancy , average size and distribution in the la site .",
    "thus , when the temperature is lowered through a transition temperature @xmath22 , charge and orbital ordering occur .",
    "up to now two distinct cases of charge - ordering have been reported for @xmath23 and @xmath24 both by transmission electron microscopy and synchrotron x - ray and neutron powder diffraction .",
    "@xcite    at half - doping ( @xmath23 ) , the system undergoes a phase transition from paramagnetic ( insulating ) to ferromagnetic - metallic ( fm ) phase at onset temperature @xmath25 k and then upon cooling to an antiferromagnetic - insulating ( afm ) phase at @xmath26 k. @xcite the antiferromagnetic phase presents charge and spin ordered structure , called ce type@xcite where real space ordering of mn@xmath27 and mn@xmath28 takes place .",
    "the basic characteristic of @xmath29 phase , at low temperature , is the one after the other ordering of the mn@xmath20 and mn@xmath28 ions along the @xmath30 ( @xmath6 setting , @xmath31 is the pseudo cubic unit cell parameter of the ideal cubic perovskite structure ) leading to a superstructure with a propagation vector @xmath32 .",
    "@xcite    for @xmath24 pioneer work of radaelli@xcite and collaborators has shown a crystallographic charge - ordered@xcite and magnetic superstructure .",
    "the antiferromagnetic structure is noncollinear with the @xmath33 lattice parameter to be tripled and the @xmath34 lattice parameter to be doubled with respect to the average crystallographic unit cell @xmath6 setting .",
    "the crystallographic structure below the charge - ordering temperature ( @xmath35 k ) is characterized by ordering of the @xmath36 orbitals of the jahn - teller - distorted mn@xmath20o@xmath37 octahedron in the orthorhombic @xmath38 plane , and the appearance of superlattice peaks in the x - ray patterns corresponding to a tripling of the @xmath33 axis lattice parameter .",
    "the refinement has revealed ordering of the mn@xmath20 cations in sites as far apart as possible in the @xmath38 plane  wigner - crystal  model and transverse displacements of the mn@xmath28o@xmath37 octahedra in the @xmath34 direction .",
    "a recent study on @xmath39 @xcite combining transmission electron microscopy with high resolution synchrotron powder x - ray diffraction data also supports the  wigner crystal  model .",
    "moreover , transmission electron microscopy studies in la@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath40 with @xmath41 and @xmath42 have shown superlattice reflections and their analysis pointed to a linear dependence between the magnitude of the modulation wave vector @xmath43 along the @xmath33 axis and @xmath44 , that is , @xmath45 .",
    "@xcite however , the superlattice reflections of the charge - ordering for @xmath3 @xcite were noticeably broader than lower compositions , indicating a very short coherence length",
    ".    given the interplay of structural , transport , and magnetic properties on these highly correlated electron systems it is extremely important to provide information on the crystal and magnetic structure for @xmath44 values above @xmath46 , for which the existing literature is rather limited.@xcite    in the present paper we discuss the crystal and magnetic structure for doping levels near the end members of the la@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 homologous series using elastic neutron diffraction data from polycrystalline la@xmath0ca@xmath1mno@xmath2 samples with @xmath3 and @xmath17 .",

    "the structure at this temperature is orthorhombic with @xmath62 . assuming that the mn site is completely occupied and refining the occupation factors for la / ca and o we found the nominal ones within the standard deviation errors . judging from the estimated mn - o distances , the octahedral distortion is small and can be considered as slightly tetragonally elongated with four short bonds @xmath63  ( two in the basal plane ( @xmath64-plane ) and two apical bond ( along @xmath65axis ) ) and two longer bonds @xmath66  in the basal plane .",

    "the distortion is smaller for the sample with @xmath4 than for that with @xmath104 .",
    "therefore , we might conclude that if at @xmath105 a clear charge - ordered state exists then when ca content is further increased , the crystal is tending more and more to acquire the structure of camno@xmath2 with a homogeneous distortion of the @xmath5 k @xmath6 phase .      in this section we will discuss the magnetic reflections appearing at @xmath106 using neutron diffraction data from the e6 diffractometer .",

    "these values are smaller than the theoretically expected for the stoichiometric mixtures of mn@xmath96 and mn@xmath98 ( e.g. @xmath142 . the smaller observed magnetic moment than their nominal value of random mixture indicate the hybridization of the mn @xmath143 orbitals and the o @xmath144 orbitals .",

    "the refinement was successful only with the @xmath9 space group , where the two mn sites in the low temperature structure have similar environments ( in terms of their bond lengths in the corresponding mno6 octahedra ) .",
    "this absence of preferential local distortions ( which would be a sign of different charges in the two mn sites ) in the mno6 octahedra have led us to conclude that charge - ordering does not occur in the monoclinic phase . however , the difference in the structural parameters for charge - order and charge disorder of mn@xmath98 and mn@xmath96 with ratios of @xmath147 and @xmath148 may be as small ( or smaller ) as the sensitivity of the experimental method .",
