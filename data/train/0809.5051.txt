    "in many astrophysical settings , emission of radiation via rotational and vibrational transitions of molecules plays an important role in cooling warm gas .",
    "because the emission of such radiation is in sharp spectral lines , this mechanism is referred to as line cooling .",
    "line radiation from the water molecule @xmath2 , with its permanent electric dipole and its high cosmochemical abundance , is significant in a variety of settings ranging from molecular clouds to protostellar envelopes ( e.g. , cernicharo & crovisier 2005 ) .",
    "more recently , line cooling from @xmath2 molecules has been recognized to play a pivotal role in the energetics following the passage of a shock wave through the dense gas in the solar nebula protoplanetary disk ( see desch et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "the rate of emission of line radiation from a warm gas containing water molecules is difficult to calculate , because there are so many accessible rotational and vibrational energy levels , and therefore a great many transitions . in dense molecular gas ( @xmath3 ) , these energy levels are populated according to boltzmann statistics ( i.e. , in local thermodynamic equilibrium , or lte ) , but at lower densities the populations must be calculated by balancing transition rates .",
    "finally , the cooling of gas by line radiation relies on the ability of the photons to escape the system without being reabsorbed ; to the extent that other , nearby molecules can absorb the emitted photons , the gas does not cool .",
    "photons generated during a molecular transition are emitted and also reabsorbed over a small range of frequencies centered on the line frequency , with an efficiency that depends on the frequency shift from the line center .",
    "rather than integrating the equations of radiative transfer over all frequencies within the line , all standard treatments of the problem instead assume integration over this  line profile \" and use a frequency - integrated escape probability of photons .",
    "this escape probability is a function of the column density of the molecule within the system .",
    "this is the approach taken by neufeld & kaufman ( 1993 ; hereafter nk93 ) , in particular .",
    "the calculation of nk93 of the rate of line cooling from @xmath2 molecules has remained the state of the art for 15 years ; but , as we discuss below , several aspects of the nk93 calculation are now out of date .",
    "their calculation uses a limited database of transitions , an oversimplified escape probability formulism , and ignores absorption by dust grains .",
    "it is one of the goals of the work here to update the @xmath2 line cooling rates to improve on the calculations of nk93 .",
    "a second goal of this paper is assess whether or not line cooling plays a significant role in cooling the gas following the passage of a shock through the dense gas of the solar nebula . as discussed by desch et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , previous modeling has not determined whether or not line cooling can be neglected .",
    "this has significant implications for the issue of chondrule formation .      the parent bodies of the most primitive meteorites , the chondrites , formed at about 2 - 3 astronomical units ( au ) from the sun , 4.57 billion years ago ( wadhwa & russell 2000 ) .",
    "chondrites are the most primitive meteorites in our collection , in that they have suffered very little alteration since their formation , and therefore contain information about the conditions that existed in the early solar nebula .",
    "chondrites are remarkable for containing calcium - rich , aluminum - rich inclusions ( cais ) , the oldest solids in the solar system , whose formation has been dated to @xmath4 mya ( amelin et al .",
    "2002 ) . also found in abundance within chondrites are sub - millimeter- to millimeter - sized , ( mostly ferromagnesian ) igneous spheres , called chondrules , from which the chondrites derive their name .",
    "chondrules formed , at most , @xmath5  2 - 3 million years after cais ( amelin et al . 2002 ; kita et al .",
    "2005 ) , as melt droplets that were heated to high temperatures while they were independent , free - floating objects in the early solar nebula .",
    "after they were heated , cooled and recrystallized , chondrules were incorporated into the parent bodies from which chondrites originate .",
    "chondrules are capable of providing incredibly detailed information about conditions in the solar system protoplanetary disk , if the process that led to their heating , melting and recrystallization could be understood .",
    "chondrules make up to 80% of the volume of ordinary chondrites ( grossman 1988 ) , and it is estimated that @xmath5 10@xmath6 g of chondrules exist in the asteroid belt today ( levy 1988 ) .",
    "such a prevalence of chondrules suggests that chondrule - forming events were widespread in the solar nebula . a process that can melt @xmath7 of rock is surely a dominant process in the solar nebula disk .",
    "the chondrule formation process , despite its obvious importance , has been a mystery in the field of meteoritics for two centuries ( sorby 1877 ) .",
    "proposed mechanisms include interaction with the early active sun , through jets ( liffman & brown 1995 ; liffman & brown 1996 ) or solar flares ( shu et al . 1996 , 1997 , 2001 ) , melting by lightning ( pilipp et al .  1998 ;",
    "desch & cuzzi 2000 ) , and melting by planetesimal impacts ( urey & craig 1953 ; urey 1967 ; sanders 1996 ; lugmair & shukolyukov 2001 ) . the dominant theory , though",
    ", is that chondrules were melted in shock waves in the protoplanetary disk ( hewins 1997 ; jones et al .",
    "2000 ; connolly & desch 2004 ; connolly et al .",
    "a shock wave , or shock front , is a sharp discontinuity between supersonic and subsonic gas , over an area only a few molecular mean free paths thick , typically only meters in the solar nebula .",
    "the gas is slowed , compressed , and heated by the time it reaches the other side of the shock front .",
    "solids moving with the gas are heated not only by thermal exchange upon entering the shocked region , but also by friction as they are slowed to the post - shock gas speed , and by absorbing the infrared radiation emitted by other solids .",
    "the shock model of chondrule formation appears able to resolve the chondrule formation mystery , because it makes several detailed predictions about chondrule formation that are largely borne out by observation and experimentation , especially regarding chondrule thermal histories .",
    "heating and cooling rates of chondrules have been determined experimentally . according to furnace experiments , in which melt droplets with chondrule compositions",
    "are allowed to cool and crystallize , reproduction of chondrule textures requires particular ranges of cooling rates between the liquidus temperature ( @xmath8 k ) and solidus temperature ( @xmath9 k ; hewins & connolly 1996 ) .",
    "porphyritic chondrules cooled at about @xmath10 , and barred - olivine chondrules cooled at about @xmath11 ( hewins et al.2005 ; see also desch & connolly 2002 ) .",
    "additionally , chondrules retain volatile elements such as s , indicating that they did not remain above the liquidus for more than minutes , and cooled quite rapidly ( @xmath12 while above the liquidus ( yu & hewins 1998 ) ) . finally , there is no indication of the isotopic fractionation that would arise from the free evaporation of alkalis such as na , which constrains the time spent at high temperature before melting ( tachibana et al .",
    "modeling of isotopic fractionation has shown that chondrules must heat up from 1300 to 1600 k on the order of minutes or less ( tachibana & huss 2005 ) .    passage through nebular shocks",
    "satisfies nearly all the experimental constraints on chondrule formation in broad brush ( iida et al .",
    "2001 , hereafter insn ; desch & connolly 2002 , hereafter dc02 ; ciesla & hood 2002 , hereafter ch02 ; desch et al .",
    "prior to passage through the shock front , chondrules are moderately heated by absorbing radiation emitted by chondrules which have already passed through the shock front . upon passage through the shock front ,",
    "the gas is immediately slowed , and compressed and heated , but the chondrules continue at supersonic speeds through the gas .",
    "they achieve their peak heating during this stage , due to absorption of radiation , thermal exchange with the gas , and supersonic frictional drag heating .",
    "this stage lasts until the chondrules slow to the gas velocity , which takes an aerodynamic stopping time , @xmath13 minute ( where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the particle density and radius , and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the post - shock gas density and sound speed ) . at this time , the gas and chondrules are dynamically coupled and chondrules are heated only by absorption of radiation and thermal exchange with the gas .",
    "soon thereafter the solids and gas become thermally coupled as well , and both components achieve similar temperatures .",
    "although the chondrules pass through the first 100 km of the post - shock region more rapidly than the gas , once they do , they will thermally equilibrate to the gas temperature .",
    "once this happens , the gas and chondrules cool together as fast as they can either radiate away energy or leave the source of infrared radiation that heats them .",
    "dc02 showed that the cooling rate of gas and chondrules should be @xmath18 where @xmath16 is the pre - shock gas density , @xmath19 the shock speed , @xmath17 is the  concentration \" of chondrules ( the chondrules - to - gas mass ratio normalized to @xmath20 , where a chondrule radius @xmath21 has been assumed ) , and @xmath22 the concentration of submicron dust ( the dust - to - gas mass ratio normalized to @xmath23 ) .",
    "more precisely , @xmath22 should be interpreted as the rosseland mean opacity of the dusty gas , normalized to @xmath24 . for typical parameters , then , cooling rates @xmath25 are obtained , consistent with the cooling rates of chondrules .",
    "the effect of line cooling  the cooling of gas by emission of so - called line photons by trace molecules in the gas such as co and @xmath2 in solar nebula shocks has been considered by insn and by miura & nakamoto ( 2006 ) . in both cases",
    "the cooling rates of nk93 were used .",
    "insn assumed a gas optically thin to the line radiation and found chondrule cooling rates @xmath26 in many cases .",
    "miura & nakamoto ( 2006 ) allowed the gas to become optically thick to this line radiation , using the formulation of nk93 described below .",
    "they found that for plausible parameters the cooling rates of chondrules and gas cluster around @xmath27 , with line cooling playing an important role in the cooling of the gas .",
    "chondrules and gas are thermally coupled only a few minutes after passing through the shock front ( insn ; dc02 ; ch02 ) , so these chondrule cooling rates are controlled by the rate at which gas cools by emission of line radiation",
    ". to understand the essence of their results without reproducing all of their calculations in detail , we now estimate the cooling rate of chondrules and gas following the shock , using the tabulations of nk93 .",
    "we first examine how the cooling rates predicted by nk93 and used by insn and miura & nakamoto ( 2006 ) are calculated . for a wide range of densities and temperatures ,",
    "nk93 calculated the steady - state level populations of @xmath0 and co molecules ( denoted ` @xmath28 ' ) , and the rates of emission of photons .",
    "the escape of these photons from a system was considered under the large - velocity - gradient ( sobolev ) approximation as a function of column density @xmath29 , via use of the parameter @xmath30 these results were adapted to a large range of geometries of interest , including those not consistent with the sobolev approximation , in particular the one of relevance to nebular shocks , a static , plane - parallel slab of thickness @xmath31 . according to nk93 , the cooling rate at the center of the slab ( at depth @xmath32 ) will depend on the similar parameter @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the thermal velocity of the molecules @xmath28 .",
    "an important assumption made by nk93 is that if the line photons can escape to the edge of the slab , then the gas is cooled ; if the photons do not escape to the edge of the slab , they are essentially re - absorbed on the spot and there is no cooling .",
    "the cooling rate per volume is then @xmath35 , where the subscript ` lte ' is the notation used by nk93 to denote cooling rates derived under the assumption that the population levels follow a boltzmann distribution , which is the regime of interest for solar nebula shocks .",
    "nk93 have tabulated @xmath36 for both vibrational and rotational lines of @xmath0 and co , for every decade in @xmath37 .",
    "the plane - parallel slab is equivalent to the nebula shock geometry because of the large velocity jump at the shock front . in a typical chondrule - forming shock ,",
    "the gas velocity changes nearly instantaneously from @xmath38 to @xmath39 , a jump of over @xmath40 .",
    "this velocity difference is much larger than the thermal velocities of the @xmath0 molecules [ @xmath41 @xmath42 at 2000",
    "k ] that control the width of the line profile . essentially , once a line photon emitted from the post - shock gas escapes to the shock front , it will continue to travel relatively unimpeded by gas .",
    "only one change to the nk93 formulation must be made before it is adopted to the nebular shock geometry . for gas a distance @xmath43 past the shock front",
    ", the equivalent thickness of the slab is @xmath44 , and the cooling rate is only half the cooling rate calculated by nk93 , who assumed radiation could escape either side of the slab .",
    "the cooling rate of the gas yields @xmath45 where we have ignored compression of the gas after passing through the shock front in this toy model , and we have assumed an abundance of he of 10% by number . converting the time derivative to a spatial derivative by assuming a constant gas velocity @xmath46 past the shock front , we find @xmath47 where we have assumed a constant @xmath34 throughout the post - shock region .",
    "in actuality , @xmath34 would decrease past the shock front , but that would merely reduce the total cooling , so our assumption overestimates the degree of cooling .",
    "this formula provides the gas temperature as a function of @xmath37 , the effective column density past the shock front .",
    "fedkin & grossman ( 2006 ) showed that the @xmath48 ratio in the solar nebula probably varied with temperature , but found that @xmath49 was a good average for the temperatures of interest .",
    "we have adopted a canonical ratio @xmath50 .",
    "this is only slightly higher than some commonly assumed canonical ratios but is consistent with the abundance of lodders ( 2003 ) , @xmath51 .",
    "we note that the exact value of @xmath48 in the chondrule formation environment is likely variable with time ( ciesla & cuzzi 2006 ) , and consider variations in this ratio later in the paper .",
    "some dissociation of @xmath0 is likely to occur at the peak post - shock temperatures we consider , but we are interested in the maximum cooling possible by line photons , so we neglect dissociation in our calculations .",
    "interpolating between the tabulated values of @xmath52 provided by nk93 , we have integrated equation  [ eq : nkcool ] to find the total drop in temperature by the time the gas is at an equivalent of @xmath53 past the shock front . for typical parameters ( pre - shock density @xmath54 and velocity @xmath55 ; mixing ratio @xmath50 ; post - shock density @xmath56 and velocity @xmath57 ; and post - shock thermal velocity @xmath58 ) , this equates to @xmath59 , a distance @xmath60 , and a time 1.6 hours after passing through the shock front .",
    "( again , this toy model neglects the compression and slowing of the gas .",
    "it also assumes wrongly that @xmath34 is constant , whereas it should decrease slightly as the gas cools .",
    "it is nonetheless illustrative . ) at these distances past the shock front , the total cooling due to rotational lines of @xmath0 and co is completely negligible , @xmath61 .",
    "this illustrates that the rotational lines become optically thick so quickly that they are unable to escape the post - shock region and cool the gas . on the other hand ,",
    "the total cooling from co vibrational line photons is roughly 72 k. this leads to an average cooling rate of @xmath62 , which is important , but not significantly greater than the cooling rates of chondrules ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "the assumption of insn that the lines of @xmath0 and co are optically thin is therefore invalidated , because these lines are indeed optically thick .",
    "the final line cooling mode ( not considered by insn , but considered by miura & nakamoto 2006 ) is vibrational line cooling from @xmath0 .",
    "we find a total cooling due to these line photons on the order of 800 k. this is a significant cooling of the gas : the average cooling over 1.6 hours is @xmath64 , with even higher cooling rates obtained early on .",
    "the cooling of the gas by vibrational line photons of @xmath0 , despite being somewhat optically thick , is the source of the high chondrule cooling rates predicted by miura & nakamoto ( 2006 ) .",
    "we confirm the statement made by miura & nakamoto ( 2006 ) that `` ... line emission is important for the gas cooling . ''",
    "we hereafter focus on cooling due to @xmath0 alone , as the dominant coolant is expected to be water .    clearly , any model of chondrule cooling rates in solar nebula shocks must account for the emission of line photons from @xmath0 .",
    "however , incorporating the cooling rates of nk93 directly into a shock code , as miura & nakamoto ( 2006 ) did , is not ideal .",
    "first , line cooling due to rotational and vibrational transitions of @xmath0 was calculated by nk93 using roughly 50,000 transitions from the hitran database ( rothman et al .",
    "while this was the best available data at the time , much more extensive databases now exist .",
    "second , nk93 calculated escape probabilities under the large - velocity - gradient ( sobolev ) approximation , and asserted that the results will apply to the case of a static , plane - parallel slab if @xmath37 is defined as described above .",
    "third , nk93 assumed a one - sided escape probability for line photons equal to @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the sobolev optical depth ; more exact escape probabilities exist , as described below .",
    "fourth , it is not necessarily the case that if photons do not escape to the edge of the slab that the gas does not cool locally ; photons re - absorbed halfway to the edge still cool the gas at the slab center . finally , nk93 did not consider the absorption of line photons by intervening dust .",
    "inclusion of dust is absolutely mandatory , as the following argument makes clear : for a solar - composition gas with 0.5% of the mass in the form of @xmath67 radius grains ( similar to the size of matrix dust grains in meteorites ) , the opacity to short - wavelength radiation is as high as @xmath68 , where the internal density of the dust grains is @xmath69 . over the distance for which the optical depth in dust is unity ,",
    "the parameter @xmath37 is therefore less than @xmath70 , assuming a ratio @xmath50 .",
    "this corresponds to distances @xmath71 , or times of about 10 minutes , after passage through the shock front . as this is smaller than the @xmath37 for which the most significant cooling takes place , dust grains are capable of absorbing photons that would otherwise cool the gas .",
    "a thorough treatment of line cooling should improve on the calculations of nk93 in the areas identified above .      in this paper",
    "we calculate the cooling rate of gas due to emission of line photons by @xmath0 molecules , improving upon the work of nk93 with the use of an expanded database , improved escape probabilities , and the inclusion of dust .",
    "first we evaluate escape probability approximations , both in the presence and absence of dust .",
    "we then calculate the cooling rates from @xmath0 molecules using the 1.2-million line scan-@xmath0 database ( jrgensen et al .",
    "finally , we incorporate these cooling rates into a toy model of chondrule thermal evolution .",
    "we conclude that for canonical parameters , line cooling is significant in the first few minutes past the shock front , but that afterward dust grains absorb the line photons that would otherwise cool the gas .",
    "we discuss the effect of the important dust - to - water ratio on these conclusions .",
    "we have used the scan-@xmath0 database of jrgensen et al . ( 2001 ) of 1.2 million lines ( rotational plus vibrational ) of the @xmath0 molecule to calculate the cooling rates due to emission of line photons from @xmath0 .",
    "we continue to assume , as nk93 did , that if photons are not able to escape the region entirely , they are re - absorbed on the spot .",
    "this assumption will be relaxed in future work , but for now it allows a crude estimate of the importance of line radiation . in other respects ,",
    "we improve on the nk93 calculation by more accurately calculating escape probabilities , and by including the possibility of absorption by dust grains .",
    "the probability that a line photon will escape a semi - infinite volume , otherwise known as the one - sided escape probability , @xmath72 , is given by @xmath73 @xmath74 @xmath75 ( avrett & hummer 1965 ; hummer & rybicki 1971 ; rybicki & lightman 1979 ; bowers & deeming 1984 ) . here",

    "a straightforward numerical integration was performed to calculate the ",
    "exact \" one - sided escape probability @xmath72 in the absence of dust .    besides the form adopted by nk93 , several other approximations to the one - sided escape probability exist in the literature .",

    ", a parameter study was conducted to determine the effect of varying the value of @xmath82 in the calculation of the voigt function .",
    "it was found that varying the value of @xmath82 between 0.0 and 0.1 increased the escape probability significantly for @xmath90 ( figure 2 ) , consistent with figures 4 and 5 of hummer & rybicki ( 1982 ) .",
    "it is not immediately clear how this will affect the overall cooling rate , but we anticipate a small effect as the lines at which the escape probability increases with increasing @xmath82 are optically thick , leading to lower cooling rates .",
    "we investigate this effect of the voigt function on the cooling rates in section 3 .",
    "dust can also absorb photons , preventing their escape .",
    "hence , the proper treatment of the escape probability must account for the absorption by dust , where the optical depth to line photons is now given by @xmath91 , and the exact escape probability is @xmath92 this equation reflects the fact that dust grains provide a continuum opacity that is always capable of absorbing photons .",
    "we have used this equation to calculate the exact escape probabilities in the presence of dust ( figure  [ fig : sprinkler ] ) .    because it is computationally burdensome to calculate the escape probability for all possible combinations of @xmath66 and @xmath93 , we seek an approximation such that the escape probability is the product of two separate , independent functions of @xmath66 and @xmath93 . on physical grounds ,",

    "this is justified if the number density of protoplanetary disks greatly exceeds the critical density of each transition . as nk93 found no variations in level populations when the density exceeded @xmath104 ,",

    "are expected to be thermally well coupled more than 100 seconds past the shock front ( dc02 ; ch02 ) , this can be interpreted as a likely cooling rate of chondrules as well . the cooling rate begins to taper off as large column densities are reached , but not until times @xmath177 , by which time the gas and chondrules have traveled roughly @xmath178 past the shock front , equivalent to a column density of water @xmath179 .    including the absorption of line photons by dust grains completely changes the thermal history of the gas and chondrules . using an opacity of dust @xmath180 ( at short wavelengths ) and a post - shock gas density of @xmath181 , the optical depth of dust exceeds unity after only 55 km past the shock front , which is reached after traveling only 48 seconds . during this first minute or so past the shock front , the line photons emitted by @xmath2 molecules escape freely and effectively cool the gas ; but after the first minute or so , they are absorbed by dust grains instead .",
    "instead of @xmath0 line photons freely escaping to the shock front and cooling the gas and dust system , the photons are reabsorbed `` on - the - spot '' and do not cool the gas .",
    "this effect of the reduced cooling rate is clearly seen in figure  [ fig : chondrule ] beyond about @xmath182 seconds .",
    "the trapping of line photons by dust grains becomes so effective , no further cooling by line emission is possible after a few minutes . ignoring the effects of cooling other than line photons",
    ", the temperature would stabilize at about 1600 k. for this particular choice of parameters , chondrules would _ not _ cool at rates @xmath165 through their crystallization temperatures ( 1400 - 1800 k ) as in insn and miura & nakamoto ( 2006 ) ; in fact , they would nt cool at all under the assumptions of our toy model .",
    "we have investigated the effect of varying the dust - to - gas and water - to - gas ratios on the cooling rates of chondrules .",
    "their behaviors are similar to those depicted in figure  [ fig : chondrule ] . in table 4",

    "we have built upon the line cooling work of nk93 , by using a much expanded database of spectral lines , improved escape probabilities , and the inclusion of dust grains .",
    "we have found that although the cooling rate due to @xmath0 line cooling is a complicated combination of gas and dust opacity , the cooling rate can be well approximated by @xmath188 .",
    "this allows us to investigate the maximum cooling effect @xmath0 line cooling will have in chondrule - forming nebular shocks .    because vibrational line photons from @xmath0 so effectively cool the gas , the high oxygen fugacities and @xmath0 densities inferred for the chondrule - forming environment ( fedkin & grossman 2007 ) would seem incompatible with cooling rates @xmath189 100 k / hr , but we find that dust significantly reduces the photon escape probabilities and the cooling rates .",
    "dust grains absorb the line photons that would escape and cool the gas . without dust ,",
    "@xmath0 line cooling reduces the temperature of the gas to 1400 - 1800@xmath190k in @xmath191 0.1 hr and cooling continues at this rate ( @xmath19210@xmath193 k / hr ) . with dust , however , the grains absorb line photons and inhibit cooling , leading to a cessation of cooling after @xmath5 0.1 hr ( @xmath5 8 min ) .",
    "line cooling is a very effective and important cooling agent in the first few minutes and must be included in any comprehensive shock model .",
    "after the first few minutes , however , the thermally well - coupled gas and chondrules cool together at a slow rate ( only as fast as they travel @xmath5 1 optical depth through the dust ) , as in dc02 and ch02 .",
    "insn failed to note this effect ; although they treat the gas and dust as well coupled ( t@xmath194 = t@xmath195 ) , their system was effectively optically thin to line emission , allowing all line photons to escape the region and cool the gas .",
    "as we are interested at this time only in the maximum cooling effects of line photons ( the  worst case scenario \" ) , our calculations of cooling rates made no assumptions about radiative transfer ; the chondrule temperatures followed the gas temperature .",
    "thermal histories of chondrules including radiative transfer , line cooling , and other relevant effects will be reported on in future work ( morris et al .  2009b , in preparation ) .",
    "since we have assumed that line photons either escape completely or are absorbed immediately , the true situation will clearly be bracketed between the two extremes shown in figure  [ fig : chondrule ] . in these calculations",
    ", we have assumed that the dust is thermodynamically coupled to the gas .",
    "all temperatures ( gas , dust , and chondrules ) , in actuality , will be determined by dust / chondrule opacity and radiative transfer .",
    "dc02 showed that the cooling rates of chondrules ( without the inclusion of line cooling ) were given by the formula that appears above as equation 1 . in the case considered in figure",
    "[ fig : chondrule ] , the chondrule concentration may be considered to be low ( @xmath196 ) , and the dust opacity is characterized by @xmath197 .",
    "this yields a total cooling rate of gas and dust through the crystallization range of about @xmath198 after line cooling shuts off .",
    "higher chondrule concentrations ( @xmath199 ) appear to have been typical during chondrule formation ( cuzzi & alexander 2006 ; alexander et al .",
    "these would increase the cooling rate to several @xmath200 .",
    "line cooling is significant during the first few minutes past the shock , and more detailed calculations will be necessary to constrain the initial drop in temperature from the peak to below the liquidus . however , our results have shown that dust effectively shuts down line cooling within minutes and it then takes hours for chondrules to crystallize in a shock , consistent with dc02 and ch02 .",
    "as mentioned previously , we did not calculate line cooling due to co , as it is a factor of @xmath5 20 less effective than @xmath0 .",
    "co also cools by emitting line photons , but dust will absorb these line photons as readily as those emitted by @xmath0 .",
    "figure  [ fig : chondrule ] shows a drop in temperature of @xmath5 600  k. if co were included , the temperature would probably drop an extra 5% ( @xmath5 630  k ) , which is within the uncertainties of the @xmath0 abundances we have assumed .",
    "this study has shown that the gas and chondrules will cool much too rapidly to match the experimental constraints on chondrule cooling rates if dust is not present .",
    "the question of the dust abundance and its opacity therefore becomes paramount .",
    "but , significantly , we have found that enhancing only the amount of @xmath0 causes higher cooling rates , whereas enhancing the amount of @xmath0 and dust together does not .",
    "what affects the cooling rate the most , therefore , is not the amount of water , but the dust - to - water ratio .",
    "potential complications , though , include the possibility that dust will evaporate immediately upon passage of the shock , and the possibility that dust vapor may recondense in the post - shock region ( e.g. , scott & krot 2005 ) .",
    "in a related vein , we note an application of this work only tangentially related to chondrule formation .",
    "ciesla et al .",
    "( 2003 ) suggested that phyllosilicates found in the fine - grained accretionary rims of chondrules in cm meteorites may have resulted from rapid gas - phase reactions of water vapor with silicates .",
    "previous studies indicated that phyllosilicate production would be kinetically inhibited in the solar nebula ( prinn & fegley 1987 ) ; however , ciesla et al .",
    "( 2003 ) showed that nebular shocks could result in a local increase in the water vapor pressure , thereby increasing the rate of phyllosilicate formation , as well as increasing the temperature at which phyllosilicates become stable .",
    "chondrule - forming shocks in icy regions of the solar nebula could therefore account for both the formation of chondrules and their fine - grained phyllosilicate rims .",
    "a possible objection to this hypothesis is that the high abundance of water vapor in the shocked region would cool the gas too rapidly to allow the production of much phyllosilicates .",
    "as our work here shows , however , rapid cooling by line photons will not be associated with shocked , water - rich nebula gas , as long as the dust - to - water ratio is close to the canonical value for the solar nebula .",
    "an investigation of this hypothesis is also planned for future work .",
