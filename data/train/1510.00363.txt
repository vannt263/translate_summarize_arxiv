    "the well - known heavy fermion system cecu@xmath0au@xmath1 ( x @xmath9 0.1 ) is often considered as a prototypical example of a local qcp@xcite . the nature of the spin fluctuation spectrum of cecu@xmath23au@xmath24 is peculiar and is not consistent with the conventional theory that successfully describes several aspects of many ce - based heavy fermion materials@xcite .",
    "inelastic neutron scattering measurements of cecu@xmath23au@xmath24 show that the imaginary part of the dynamic susceptibility at the qcp exhibits an @xmath25 scaling relation @xmath26 with an anomalous value of the scaling exponent @xmath27 0.75@xcite .",
    "the scaling relation as well as the logarithmic divergence of @xmath28 with temperature in cecu@xmath0au@xmath1 are in accord with the behavior expected for a local qcp .",
    "while great attention has been given to the evolution of magnetic properties with au doping into cecu@xmath4 , less attention has been paid to the evolution of the structural properties .",
    "the cecu@xmath0au@xmath1 system exhibits a structural phase transition from orthorhombic ( @xmath5 ) to monoclinic ( @xmath6 ) that can be tuned by pressure or chemical doping@xcite .",
    "previous studies have reported different values of the structural transition temperature ( @xmath7 ) for the end member , cecu@xmath4 , but are all within the range 168 k - 230 k@xcite . in cecu@xmath0au@xmath1 , @xmath7 decreases linearly with au concentration and the structural phase transition disappears beyond the critical concentration , @xmath8 @xmath9 0.14 , which is close to the magnetic qcp , @xmath29 @xmath9 0.1@xcite .",
    "moreover , one study indicates that the structural transition disappears and magnetic order emerges at nearly the same point in the phase diagram , raising the possibility that a quantum multi - critical point at @xmath30 @xmath9 0.13 is the origin of the unusual quantum critical behavior in cecu@xmath0au@xmath1 @xcite .",

    "the magnetic bragg peaks observed for all compositions are found to be resolution limited , consistent with the presence of the long range magnetic order .",

    "the resulting order parameter data is used to characterize the magnetic phase transition .",
    "the neel temperatures ( @xmath41 ) are estimated by fitting the power law equation , @xmath42 . at temperatures close to @xmath41 , some rounding of the order parameter is observed .",
    "the two most likely reasons for this are the presence of critical scattering or a small compositional variation leading to a distribution of t@xmath43s .",

    ". on the other hand , a departure from the behavior of a qcp and the associated expectation of mean field behavior ( @xmath46 = 0.5 ) may be the result of the recovery of classical critical behavior and the presence of critical scattering at temperatures close to t@xmath43 . with the currently available data we are unable to distinguish between these two possibilities .",
    "therefore , the value of @xmath46 was restricted to the mean field value of 0.5 .",
    "mean field behavior has previously been observed near the qcp in other heavy fermion systems@xcite .",

    "this gives @xmath41 = 0.51(1 ) , which is identical to the value extracted from fitting the order parameter ( @xmath41 = 0.50(2 ) ) as well as previously published heat capacity measurements @xcite .",

    "the representational analysis of cecu@xmath51pd@xmath52 using the monoclinic space group along with the corresponding propagation vector @xmath57 = ( 0 0.23 0.58 ) indicates that each orbit constitutes a single representation with three real basis vectors along @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 axes of the monoclinic structure .",
    "the fit of the magnetic structure assuming a sinusoidal modulation of the moment indicates that the moments are pointed along @xmath61 axis of the monoclinic structure ( @xmath62axis of the orthorhombic structure ) , identical to the magnetic structure of cecu@xmath47ag@xmath48 described above .",
    "the fit of the observed intensity is shown in the figure [ structure]c .",
    "the ordered moment obtained from a neutron diffraction measurement is proportional to the square root of the intensity of the magnetic bragg peak , which is generally scaled to the nuclear reflections to provide an absolute value . assuming that the magnetic structure does nt vary with the doping composition , the moments of other compositions were determined from a comparison of the normalized magnetic intensity with respect to cecu@xmath47ag@xmath48 and cecu@xmath51pd@xmath52 . for the compositions near the qcp ,",
