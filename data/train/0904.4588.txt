    "a widely studied type of soi in such heterostructures is the so - called rashba soi , @xcite which originates from the structural inversion asymmetry of the interface confining potential that is accompanied by an electric field directed along the normal of the interface , coupling the electron spin and orbital motion .",

    "in the classical random walk on the line , the walker tosses a coin before each step . the direction of the step",
    "is determined by the actual state of the coin , i.e. , the walker takes a step to the left if the coin is heads or to the right if the coin is tails ( or vice versa ) .",
    "the quantum analog of such a walk uses a quantum coin , the state of which can be a linear combination of the classical heads and tails , or mathematically , any state of a coin hilbert space @xmath0 , spanned by the two basis states @xmath1 , where @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) stand for left ( right ) .",
    "the positions of the walker also span a hilbert space @xmath4 with @xmath5 corresponding to the walker localized in position @xmath6 .",
    "the states of the total system are in the space @xmath7 .",
    "the conditional step of the walker dependent on the state of the coin , can be described by the unitary operation @xmath8 the coin - toss is realized by a unitary operation @xmath9 acting in the space @xmath0 .",
    "the qw of @xmath10 steps is defined as the transformation @xmath11 , where @xmath12 , acting on @xmath13 is given by @xmath14 with @xmath15 being the identity operator .",
    "a frequently used balanced unitary coin is the hadamard coin @xmath16 , which is represented by a matrix in which each element is of equal magnitude .    in the qw the coin state is not measured during intermediate iterations ,",
    "thus quantum correlations between different positions are kept , leading to interference in subsequent steps .",
    "we note that this interference causes a radically different behavior from that of the classical random walk .",
    "in particular , the probability distribution of the walk on the line does not approach a gaussian  it leads to a double - peaked distribution  and the variance @xmath17 is not linear in the number of steps @xmath10 , it scales with @xmath18 , which implies that the expected distance from the origin is of order @xmath19 , i.e. the quantum walk propagates quadratically faster than the classical random walk .",
    "this property is at the heart of algorithmic applications .    in our proposal ,",
    "the walker is the electron , which is transported through a two - dimensional network of quantum rings .",
    "the coin states @xmath20 are represented by appropriate orthogonal states of the electron spin , while the hilbert - space @xmath21 is characterized by the discrete positions of the electron in one spatial direction in the network . in the following sections we will show , that quantum rings with appropriate radius and soi strength act essentially as the unitary transformations @xmath16 and @xmath22 .",
    "namely , a ring connected with two leads acts essentially as the hadamard operation @xmath16 , while a totally symmetric three - terminal ring can implement the step operation @xmath22 given by eq .",

    "these rings together ( which we will call a functional unit ) act as the unitary transformation @xmath12 , given by eq .",
    "( [ u ] ) .",
    "we note that this kind of operation of the network is based on the fact that practically zero reflection can be ensured at each individual ring , by appropriately choosing the strength of the rashba soi and the geometry .",
    "if considerable reflections were present in the network , the state of the walker would spread out in two - dimensions , and the analogy with the model of the qw could not be made .",
    "in this section we propose two- and three - terminal rings to be buliding blocks of the qw scheme , and introduce the unit , which implements a single step of the qw with a hadamard coin .",
    "it consists of a two - terminal ring realizing the hadamard transformation ( hadamard - ring ) and a subsequent three - terminal ring which performs the step operation ( step - ring ) .",
    "we consider a narrow ring of radius @xmath23 situated in the @xmath24 plane .",

    "we will show in the following section , that three - terminal rings of the same size as the step ring with an appropriate soi strength , can also rotate the spin states in the desired way , as well as allow of the continuation of the units .",
    "clearly , the functional units have to be combined so that the walker can arrive in any intermediate point on the line of the walk from two directions , i.e. , interference phenomena can take place . in order to implement this crucial property of the qw , we use another quantum ring , which is capable of adding the two probabilty amplitudes that both represent the walker at the given point on the line of the walk , as well as rotating the spins back into the basis states @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "now we show , that this can be done with a completely symmetric three - terminal ring which has the same radius as the step ring , and in which the magnitude of the soi strength is the same , but its direction is opposite .    if two leads of a symmetric , three - terminal ring are considered as inputs and the other terminal as an output ( see fig .",
