    "many materials of high current interest for condensed matter physics are metals with strong spin fluctuations , for example doped cuprates and iron pnictides . in both classes , spin fluctuations are thought to mediate the superconducting pairing at relatively high temperatures.@xcite spin fluctuations are also crucial in the normal state , where they provide an important scattering mechanism and thus strongly affect transport .",
    "the transport properties of the pnictides are nevertheless quite distinct from the cuprates and show unusual temperature dependences.@xcite the main ingredients needed for the description of transport in these systems have been controversially discussed.@xcite    the scattering of electrons off spin fluctuations is governed by the spin susceptibility .",
    "close to an antiferromagnetic instability , the susceptibility is strongly peaked in momentum space in the vicinity of the possible ordering vectors @xmath0 .",
    "transport in such systems can thus often be understood based on the concept of hot and cold regions of the fermi surfaces.@xcite the hot regions are the parts of the fermi surfaces that are connected by the possible ordering vectors @xmath0 .",
    "the scattering is particularly strong in these regions .",
    "conversely , in the cold regions not connected by ordering vectors the scattering rate is lower .",
    "if the difference in the scattering rate is large , i.e. , close to the instability , transport is thus dominated by the cold regions with high conductivity , and the hot regions are then said to be `` short - circuited . ''",
    "the concept of hot and cold regions generally explains the experimental observations for cuprates and was implicitly assumed to hold also for the pnictides.@xcite an analysis of the lifetimes of excited electrons close to the fermi surfaces seems to support this picture,@xcite with the imperfect nesting of electron and hole fermi pockets naturally leading to the appearance of hot and cold regions with short and long lifetimes , respectively .    within the _ relaxation - time approximation _",
    "( rta ) , in which the complex relaxation dynamics of each state is modeled by a simple exponential decay , the transport relaxation time is approximated by the lifetime . since the conductivity is directly proportional to the relaxation time , the states with short lifetimes then do not contribute significantly to the transport . in this paper",
    "we show that in multiband systems this effect can be compensated if the forward - scattering corrections to the rta are taken into account .",
    "forward - scattering corrections , which are equivalent to vertex corrections in the kubo formalism , have been studied extensively for one - band models relevant for cuprates and heavy - fermion systems.@xcite the pnictides are , in contrast , multiband systems with electron and hole fermi pockets .",
    "the study of two - band models with circular fermi pockets has shown that forward - scattering corrections to the rta are huge close to the antiferromagnetic instability and that they give rise to transport anomalies such as a large enhancement of the hall coefficient@xcite and negative magnetoresistance.@xcite the minority carriers , i.e. , the carriers on the smaller fermi pocket , were found to exhibit negative transport times , indicating a drift in the direction opposite of what one would expect based on their charge .",
    "however , in the simplified models with circular fermi pockets all states on a given fermi pocket are equivalent because of rotational symmetry .",
    "they are thus unable to address the concept of hot and cold regions , which only appear for noncircular fermi pockets .    in this article",
    "we present a semiclassical boltzmann theory of transport for a two - band model with elliptical electron pockets relevant for the iron pnictides .",
    "we show that due to the forward scattering , the hot - spot picture fails for the pnictides even for very strong spin fluctuations and highly elliptical electron pockets .",
    "in contrast to the lifetimes , which are highly anisotropic around the fermi pockets with deep minima at the hot spots , the effective transport relaxation times are found to be much more isotropic and to show no special features at the hot spots .",
    "our approximate analytical solution of the boltzmann equation provides insight into the mechanism behind this effect : the anisotropy of the spin - fluctuation scattering extends the effective relaxation time . at the hot spots , the reduction of the relaxation time due to the stronger scattering",
    "is thus compensated by the extension due to the higher anisotropy .    to elucidate the consequences of this mechanism , we calculate numerically the temperature - dependent transport coefficients from the full boltzmann equation and compare them to the analytical solution and the rta , finding that the rta makes qualitatively incorrect predictions . for strongly momentum - dependent scattering",

    "noncircular _ fermi pockets , which means that the vector mean free path is generally not parallel to the velocity .",
    "the common feature is that strong anisotropic scattering forces the vector mean free path of electron and hole pockets at @xmath49 to point in the same direction , which is set by the majority carriers . in the relevant parameter range for our model , we will find that the direction is set by the electrons since there are two electron pockets .",
    "a change of the dominant carrier type can only be achieved by strong hole doping .",

    "as discussed in section [ aa ] , such a huge anisotropy leads to an effective relaxation time that is much longer than the lifetime .",
    "in effect , during the relaxation , an electron initially on the hole fermi pocket scatters multiple times between states on the hole pocket and states on the electron fermi pockets , which have nearly opposite velocity . since there are more states on the electron pockets than on the hole pocket , the electron spends the larger part of the time on the electron pockets .",

    "the change in the anisotropy parameters @xmath134 with the chemical potential .",
    "figure [ fig : figure4 ] shows that for the chosen parameters , the two effects contribute to @xmath160 with opposite sign . the full results for the nernst coefficient @xmath157 change sign between the ellipticities @xmath141 and @xmath159 .",

    "the scattering is more isotropic due to the large discrepancy in size between the electron and hole pockets .    at high temperatures ,",
    "the transport coefficients all show a smooth doping dependence resulting from the change in the fermi surfaces and velocities in the presence of mostly isotropic scattering . in the intermediate temperature range , where anisotropic scattering is strong , this is overlaid by nontrivial doping dependence due to the forward - scattering corrections .",
    "the resistivity around @xmath165 is largest for intermediate fillings , for which the fermi pockets are well nested .",
    "this is because the narrow peaks in the spin susceptibilities at @xmath5 and @xmath6 lead to efficient scattering only for nested fermi pockets .",
    "the inefficiency of anisotropic scattering for small and large @xmath17 causes a rapid decrease in the resistivity with doping , as shown in the inset in fig.[fig : figure5](a ) .",
    "note that the _ relative _ change in @xmath166 with doping is much larger here than at high temperatures .",
    "since the seebeck coefficient @xmath160 is proportional to @xmath167 , it is sensitive to this relative change in @xmath166 with @xmath16 or @xmath17 and is , therefore , strongly enhanced in the intermediate temperature range with strong scattering anisotropy , as fig.[fig : figure5](c ) clearly shows .    for the hall coefficient @xmath168 , fig .",
    "[ fig : figure5](b ) , one would naively expect the largest and smallest values for the most strongly hole - doped and electron - doped cases , respectively , since electrons and holes contribute with opposite signs .",
    "this is indeed the case at @xmath169 , where the scattering is nearly isotropic and no negative current contributions occur . at @xmath165 , however , fig .",
    "[ fig : figure5](b ) shows a strong negative enhancement of @xmath168 for intermediate filling . according to fig .",
    "[ fig : figure5](e ) , the contribution of the holes to the total current is negative in this range . in the semiclassical picture",
    "this means that the holes drift in the same direction as the electrons , reducing the charge current .",
    "irrespective of that , the magnetic field deflects the holes and the electrons in the same direction .",
    "hence , the inverted sign of the hole contribution reduces the charge current without changing the hall voltage .",
    "this gives rise to an enhancement of the hall coefficient defined as the hall voltage relative to the charge current .",
    "the nernst coefficient @xmath157 plotted in fig .  [ fig : figure5](d ) is highly sensitive to small doping changes and also , as is evident from fig.[fig : figure4 ] , to changes in the band parameters .",
    "equations ( [ alpha])([rh ] ) and ( [ nernst ] ) show that @xmath170 the nernst coefficient is thus sensitive to the nonmonotonic doping dependence of both @xmath166 and @xmath168 . for the cases we have considered",
    ", the contributions from @xmath166 and @xmath168 usually counteract each other .",
    "the complicated behavior of @xmath157 , for example the different sign of @xmath157 for @xmath171 compared to the other fillings , is thus due to the quantitative competition of the doping dependences of @xmath166 and @xmath168 and not to any clear qualitative features in the fermi surfaces or the scattering .",
    "this suggests that the other coefficients might be more advantageous as probes of the electronic system .",
    "however , the detailed comparison of experimental transport coefficients and calculations for realistic models remains work for the future .",
    "we have studied transport in a two - band model relevant for the iron pnictides , using the semiclassical boltzmann equation .",
    "forward - scattering corrections due to anisotropic interband scattering off spin fluctuations have been included .",
    "spin fluctuations have been described by a phenomenological millis - monien - pines susceptibility,@xcite with temperature - dependent parameters chosen based on neutron - scattering results for the pnictides.@xcite our analytical and numerical investigations show that the anisotropic scattering gives rise to unusual transport behavior . most surprisingly , the hot spots are _ not _ short - circuited by the cold regions of the fermi pockets even for very strong scattering .",
    "the enhanced scattering rate in the hot regions indeed leads to a short lifetime there , but this effect is balanced by the enhanced vector mean free path due to the anisotropic scattering .",
    "this breakdown of the concept of hot and cold regions is not found in a simple rta neglecting forward - scattering corrections .",
    "the nearly isotropic contribution of states around the fermi pocket to the transport , even for strongly elliptical electron pockets , justifies the discussion of transport in terms of isotropic mobilities for each pocket .",
    "however , as discussed for the case of circular pockets,@xcite the mobility of the minority carriers can turn negative in the regime of highly anisotropic scattering . in the present work",
    ", negative mobility corresponds to inverted vector mean free paths and the resulting negative current contributions .",
    "the contribution of hot spots to the transport and the occurrence of negative currents are the main features that distinguish the transport properties of pnictides from previously considered one - band systems with similarly anisotropic scattering . in this work ,",
    "we have presented unusual temperature and doping dependences of various transport coefficients . beyond this , negative current contributions can also lead to a negative magnetoresistance.@xcite however , the present model with two electron pockets and one hole pocket does not show negative magnetoresistance in the considered parameter range .",
