    "the successful application of relativistic hydrodynamics @xcite to the description of high energy heavy ion collisions @xcite has led not only to a revival of this theory , but also to the demand of enlarging its domain of applicability to regimes where the system of interest is still away from local thermal equilibrium @xcite , and so the usual strategy of deriving hydrodynamics as an expansion in deviations from ideal behavior is not available .",
    "moreover , the best known implementations of this strategy , namely the chapman - enskog @xcite and grad @xcite approximations , face severe problems , such as spurious instabilities , as it will be shown below .    the so - called divergence type theories ( dtts)@xcite are an appealing alternative for the derivation of relativistic causal hydrodynamics because in this framework both the conservation laws for particle number and the energy - momentum tensor ( emt ) as well as the second law of thermodynamics are rigorous properties of the theory , no matter how far from ideal behavior . for this reason the solutions of the theory may be trusted to be at least qualitatively faithful to the underlying kinetic theory .",
    "by contrast , a formalism that only enforces the second law in an approximate way could lead to unphysical results if the system makes a large excursion away from local thermal equilibrium , even if it is a transient one , and then the whole further evolution would be compromised .",
    "furthermore , in more complete theories including interactions with gauge fields@xcite , these spurious instabilities could mask or get entangled with legitimate plasma instabilities@xcite .    in this paper we shall analyze the derivation of dtt relativistic hydrodynamics from kinetic theory taking as test case a gas of spinless and massless particles obeying fermi - dirac statistics @xcite . in the grad approach ,",
    "this derivation consists on formulating an ansatz for the one particle distribution function ( 1pdf ) , parameterized by the hydrodynamic variables .",
    "later on the hydrodynamic currents such as the particle number current and the emt are derived as moments of the parameterized 1pdf , and the corresponding equations as moments of the boltzmann equation @xcite .",
    "this procedure may be replicated in the dtt framework , but it leads to formally divergent expressions .",
    "therefore it is necessary to interpolate a process of regularization and renormalization by which these expressions become meaningful .",
    "the conclusion is that a dtt can be derived from kinetic theory , but not uniquely .    as a demonstration of the formalism we shall carry on the procedure , adopting a regularization and renormalization scheme that does not introduce new dimensionful parameters in the theory , preserves positive expressions , and gives the right results in equilibrium , where all relevant expressions are finite to begin with .",
    "we shall use the resulting dtt to investigate the stability of an anisotropic ( though axisymmetric ) homogeneous configuration ( a precise characterization will be given below ) .",
    "these are always stable in kinetic theory , but we will show that the grad approximation predicts an instability if the anisotropy exceeds a certain threshold",
    ". dtt agrees with kinetic theory predicting again stability for any anisotropy . as it ought to be expected",
    ", the quantitative agreement worsens for larger deviations form equilibrium .",
    "let us be more specific about the contents of this paper .",
    "we consider a gas of massless , spinless particles obeying fermi - dirac statistics . in relativistic kinetic theory @xcite",
    ", the state of the gas is described by a 1pdf @xmath0 , where the momentum variable is restricted to the positive mass shell @xmath1 , @xmath2 ( we adopt the @xmath3 signature for minkowsky metric @xmath4 ) .",
    "from @xmath5 we derive the emt t^=dpp^p^f [ emt ] where @xmath6 is the invariant measure dp=(p^2)(p^0 ) observe that @xmath7 is traceless .",
    "@xmath7 admits one ( and only one ) timelike eigenvector t^u_=- u^ @xmath8 .",
    "we say @xmath9 is the ( landau - lifshitz ) fluid velocity @xcite , and @xmath10 the energy density .",
    "the other relevant current is the entropy flux s^=-dpp^\\{(1-f)(1-f)+ff } [ entropy ] and @xmath11 is the entropy density . in equilibrium , the 1pdf must maximize the entropy density for a given energy density .",
    "this obtains when @xmath5 is the fermi - dirac distribution f_eq=1e^-_p^+1 [ fd ] where @xmath12 , @xmath13 being the temperature .",
    "thus in equilibrium t_eq^&=&_sbt^4s_eq^&=&43_sbt^3u^ [ eqcur ] where @xmath14 and @xmath15 is stefan - boltzmann s constant .",
    "out of equilibrium @xmath5 evolves according to the boltzmann equation @xcite p^f = i_col[boltzmann ] the collision integral @xmath16 vanishes in equilibrium , and obeys dpp^i_col=0 which enforces emt conservation t^_,=0 [ conservation ] and the @xmath17 theorem dpi_col0 which enforces the second law s^_,0 .",

    "( [ conservation ] ) are therefore not enough to predict the evolution of the emt .",
    "the problem of relativistic hydrodynamics is to provide the missing equations .",

    "thus in this approach the viscous emt is slaved to the degrees of freedom that describe the ideal fluid at @xmath26 .",
    "this eventually leads to a parabolic system of equations of motion , incompatible with relativistic causality @xcite .    to overcome this difficulty",

    "moreover , we shall show below the theory has spurious instabilities even before that limit is reached .    to obtain a dynamics for these new @xmath21 degrees of freedom in the viscous emt ,",

    "this approach leads to a maxwell - cattaneo @xcite equation for @xmath31 and enforces causality .",
    "however , it can not be applied arbitrarily far from equilibrium , because , as we shall show below , it predicts instabilities that do not exist in the kinetic theory .",
    "the dtt framework keeps eqs .",
    "( [ conservation ] ) and ( [ nec ] ) as the fundamental equations , but now seeks a 1pdf which maximizes entropy density for given energy density and @xmath32 components in the rest frame .",
    "this leads to the introduction of a new tensor lagrange multiplier @xmath33 besides @xmath13 and @xmath34 . assuming @xmath33 is symmetric , traceless and transverse , it is equivalent to @xmath21 new degrees of freedom .",
    "thus the theory has enough room to match _ any _ emt , with the nec slaved to it ( we will return to this point below ) .",
    "this means that in the dtt , two evolutions starting with the same emt will remain identical , though it is known that they may diverge in kinetic theory @xcite .",
    "even so , we will show that the dtt outperforms the grad approximation , in the sense that it is free from the spurious instabilities that appear in the latter .",
    "the problem is that , though the variational problem leading to the dtt 1pdf is easily solved , the formal expressions one obtains for the emt and the nec diverge @xcite . thus it is necessary to regularize and renormalize them to make sense of the theory .",
    "this adds a new , non unique stage in the derivation of hydrodynamics from kinetic theory . our goal is to show a concrete procedure to obtain finite quantities for the relevant currents , and then to use this procedure to demonstrate the stability of anisotropic , axisymmetric configurations , in agreement with kinetic theory .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in next section",
    "we provide some further background on the dtt framework , starting from the purely macroscopic point of view whereby it was first introduced , and then linking it to kinetic theory .",
    "then we proceed to regularize and renormalize the formal expressions for the emt and nec .",
    "section 3 provides a first comparison of dtt and grad hydrodynamics through the analysis of the pressure anisotropy ; we show that while in grad hydrodynamics the pressure anisotropy becomes negative when far from equilibrium , in dtt it is bounded below .",
    "section 4 is the main part of this paper ; here we discuss the stability of anisotropic homogeneous configurations , comparing the analysis made within dtt and grad hydrodynamics to the one in kinetic theory .",
    "we conclude that while both kinetic theory and dtt predict anisotropic axisymmetric configurations are always stable , grad hydrodynamics shows an instability if the anisotropy is large enough .",
    "we conclude with some brief final remarks .",
    "dtts are theories in which all the dynamical equations can be written as divergences of tensor fields .",
    "they were originally developed by liu , mller and ruggeri@xcite as a response to the perceived flaws of the so - called `` first order '' relativistic hydrodynamics of eckart @xcite and landau - lifshitz @xcite .",
    "they were later extended by the works of geroch and lindblom@xcite and reula and nagy@xcite .",

    "this means we are not adding extra degrees of freedom . to relate these currents among themselves",
    ", it is assumed not only that there is an entropy flux vector @xmath41 ( cfr .",
    "( [ entropy ] ) ) whose divergence @xmath42 ( cfr .",
    "( [ secondlaw ] ) ) is positive , but moreover that both @xmath41 and @xmath42 are algebraic functions of @xmath35 and @xmath36 , such that the positivity of @xmath42 follows from eqs . and alone .",
