    "massive stars affect the structure and the evolution of the clouds around them substantially . globules and clouds with bright rims and cometary appearance",
    "are found in the vicinity of many nearby ob associations e.g. vela ( gum nebula ; sridharan 1992 ) , orion ( bally et al . 1991 ) , cepheus ( indrani & sridharan 1994 ) and rosette ( patel , xie & goldsmith 1993 ) .",
    "in addition to affecting the morphology , these stars also accelerate the globules and possibly induce star formation in them as well .",
    "there are many clouds in the orion complex which show evidence of being affected by the nearby stars .",
    "lynd s dark cloud l1616 with its cometary appearance is one among them .",
    "it also harbors a bright reflection nebula ngc 1788 , also known as ced 040 , excited by a poor star cluster .",
    "study of a cloud with an associated reflection nebula offers many advantages .",
    "since reflection nebulae mark close spatial association of relatively dense interstellar clouds with luminous stars of spectral type b1 or later , the distance to the star and hence to the cloud can be estimated to a reasonable accuracy .",
    "this allows one to determine sizes , masses and luminosities reliably .",
    "a reflection nebula with newly born stars provides an oppurtunity to study the effects of recent formation of stars with intermediate masses .",
    "in particular , one that harbors a new - born cluster is most suited to study cloud fragmentation .",
    "stars , newly formed or otherwise , have significant effects on the thermal balance of a cloud .",
    "hence , study of such a cloud where there is an identifiable dominant energy source ( but not as disruptive as o stars ) permits one to investigate the heating and cooling in them .",
    "l1616 appears to be unique among the reflection nebulae .",
    "as shown in the next section , l1616 has an estimated star formation efficiency of @xmath4 14% , much larger than other clouds with associated reflection nebulae .",
    "the cometary appearance of the cloud , the peculiar location of the nebula near its edge facing the bright orion belt stars , and its suspected high star formation efficiency indicate that the cluster formation in the cloud is possibly induced .",
    "furthermore , no iras source with a spectrum typical of young stellar objects is found within the cloud boundary .",
    "this may suggest that the formation of the cluster has pre - empted any further star formation - a self regulatory process often invoked in the literature .",
    "thus , l1616 seems to be an object of considerable interest .",
    "we mapped this cloud in j = 1 @xmath5 0 transitions of both @xmath1co and @xmath2co with a view to determine its mass more reliably and to discern any mass motions that may be present . in this paper",
    "we present the maps and argue that induced star formation is most likely to be the case and that the cloud is fragmenting .    in the following section we estimate the star formation efficiencies ( sfe ) of a few clouds with associated reflection nebulae and",
    "show that l1616 is unique among them .",
    "in section 3 we present the details of the observations and the maps of l1616 .",
    "the results are discussed in section 4 .",
    "star formation efficiency ( sfe ) usually refers to the ratio of the total mass in the stars to the sum of this stellar mass and the mass of the cloud or cloud segment they are born in .",
    "we estimate the masses in these two components for the bright reflection nebulae in the following way using their optical and infrared data from the literature .    *",
    "masses of the clouds :* : :     the cloud mass can be expressed as    2@xmath6 , where    @xmath7 is the molecular hydrogen column density ,    @xmath8 the atomic mass of hydrogen ,    @xmath9 the solid angle of the cloud and    @xmath10 its distance from the sun . to estimate    @xmath9 and @xmath7 reliably , the    clouds need to be mapped both in @xmath1co and    @xmath2co .",
    "however , for most of the reflection nebulae    such maps are not available .",
    "hence , we use their optical obscuration    solid angles listed in the catalogues of dark clouds ( lynds 1962 ;    feitzinger & stuwe 1984 ; hartley et al .",
    "we wish to note that    only the mass in dense portions of the cloud , which the optical    obscuration would trace well , may be relevant for the estimation of    sfe .",
    "molecular hydrogen column density seems to be nearly constant in    clouds over a wide range of sizes ( larson 1981 ) and we take this to be    @xmath11 @xmath12 , typical of    the small molecular clouds .",
    "the masses estimated in this way will be    very approximate .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that this will not be a    severe handicap for the relative comparison of sfe attempted here .",
    "* masses in stars :* : :    many optically bright reflection nebulae are also bright in far    infrared ( fir ) and have been detected by iras .",
    "their fir emission    results from reprocessing of the radiation from the exciting stars by    the dust in the surrounding cloud . in most cases , the spectral type of    the brightest member of the exciting stars is also known .",
    "then , if one    assumes all stars to be of the same spectral type , a lower limit to    the mass in stars is given by    @xmath13 .    here",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively , are the mass    and luminosity of the brightest star in the cluster derived from its    spectral type ( allen 1976 ) , @xmath16 is the fraction of the    stellar radiation that is reprocessed which is taken to be 0.3 ( albedo    = 0.7 , witt & schild 1986 ) and @xmath17 is the fir flux    density derived in the following way using the measured flux densities    in the four iras bands ( margulis , lada & young 1989 ) :    +    @xmath18 in this expression the flux    densities are in jy and @xmath19 , the longest    wavelength at which the flux density is measured is in    @xmath20 m , and @xmath21 the    corresponding flux density .",
    "the last term is the estimated flux    emitted longward of @xmath19 ( myers et al .",
    "1987 ) .",
    "this is obtained by assuming that @xmath21 is    also the maximum over the entire spectrum , and that the spectrum is    like that of a blackbody for wavelengths longer than    @xmath19 .",
    "however , it should be noted that if star    formation is _ very _ recent , as the luminosities of protostars change    considerably with time ( lada 1991 ) , the above estimate of mass in    stars can be inaccurate .",
    "since the masses of both the components depend similarly on the distance , their ratio is independent of it resulting in the following expression for the minimum sfe .    @xmath22           \\times \\frac{1}{(2\\;m_{h}\\;n_{h_{2}}\\;\\omega_{c } ) } \\nonumber \\\\ { } ~&=&~    1.286     \\times    10^{9}~\\frac{(m / m_{\\odot})}{(l / l_{\\odot } ) }     \\ ; \\frac{(s_{fir}/erg\\;s^{-1}\\;cm^{-2})}{(\\omega_{c}/\\mu~\\rm steradian)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , the only quantities entering the estimates are : the solid angle of the clouds , the iras flux densities of the associated nebulae and the mass and the luminosity of the exciting star with the earliest spectral type .",
    "we use this approach to determine sfe of a few clouds with associated reflection nebulae . in table 1",
    "we have listed the names of the nebulae ( row 1 ) , of the brightest stars exciting them ( row 2 ) , their spectral type ( row 3 ) , mass ( row 4 ) and luminosity ( row 5 ) , the names of the associated clouds ( row 6 ) , their solid angle ( row 7 ) and mass ( row 8) , names of the associated extended iras sources ( row 9 ) , their flux densities in the four bands ( row 10 - 13 ) , the fir fluxes @xmath17 ( row 14 ) , and their estimated sfe ( row 15 ) .",
    "the spectral type of the stars exciting the nebulae have been taken from the catalogues of reflection nebulae ( van den bergh 1966 ; van den bergh & herbst 1975 ) .",
    "table 1 shows that l1616 has the highest estimated sfe .",
    "two other clouds , l1630 and sc064 , also have high estimated sfe but their masses are likely to be under - estimates owing to their large physical sizes .",
    "this can be seen from the following .",
    "one could take the volume density of molecular hydrogen , n@xmath23 , in the clouds to be the same instead of the column density . then ,",
    "for spherical clouds , the new sfe@xmath24 is given by ,    @xmath25 a value of 1100 @xmath26 has been assumed for n@xmath23 such that sfe and sfe@xmath24 are the same for the cloud l1616 ( this choice does not affect the relative values of sfe@xmath24 derived ) .",
    "row 16 in table 1 lists sfe@xmath24 calculated this way using distances ( last row ) taken from the literature ( racine 1968 ; herbst 1975 ) . table 1 shows that sfe@xmath24 for the two clouds , l1630 and sc064 , are much smaller than that of l1616 .",
    "nevertheless , they also appear peculiar and merit further studies . before leaving this section",
    ", we wish to emphasise that the sfes calculated here are very approximate .",
    "the estimated stellar mass being a minimum makes the calculated sfe to be a lower limit .",
    "but , this is made quite uncertain because of the error in the estimate of the cloud mass .",
    "for example , the assumption that the density is the same for all the clouds may not be valid . in this sense , both the small clouds ( l1616 & sg033 ) having high sfes may be a bias effect resulting from them being denser .",
    "thus , detailed co observations are needed to confirm these sfes .",
    "we have carried out such observations for the cloud l1616 .",
    "above estimates suggest that , among the clouds with associated reflection nebulae , the cloud l1616 has an abnormally high sfe . however , as mentioned already , it is necessary to make detailed co maps to determine the cloud mass and hence the sfe more reliably .",
    "such maps would also help to ascertain if mass motions are present .",
    "for this purpose , we mapped the cloud l1616 in @xmath27 transitions of @xmath1co and @xmath2co with a @xmath28 beam and a grid - point spacing of one beam .",
    "the observations were carried out during the winters of 90 - 91 and 91 - 92 using the 10.4 m millimeterwave telescope at the raman research institute campus , bangalore ( for a brief description of the telescope see patel 1990 ; sridharan 1993 ) .",
    "a filter - bank spectrometer with 250 khz ( 0.65 kms@xmath29 ) resolution covering a total bandwidth of 64 mhz was used . during the observations ,",
    "pointing was checked by beam switched continuum scans on jupiter ( see patel 1990 for details ) and the rms pointing error was estimated to be @xmath30 .",
    "an ambient temperature load was used for calibration . during the observations the dsb t@xmath31 ranged from 600@xmath32k to 1200@xmath32k .",
    "frequency switching by 15.25@xmath32mhz was used for all the observations and the spectra obtained were appropriately combined .",
    "third order polynomials were fitted to estimate and remove the curved baselines .",
    "most of the final spectra had an rms noise of @xmath40.25 k and the estimated rms error on the velocities is @xmath4 0.3 kms@xmath29 . we estimate the forward spillover and scattering efficiency , @xmath33 , to be 0.57 and 0.63 at the @xmath1co and @xmath2co frequencies , respectively , by comparing the measured antenna temperatures on the calibration sources ( mostly ori a ) with the source brightness temperatures reported in the literature ( taken to be 73 k and 16 k at the two frequencies , respectively , for ori a ) .",
    "we have also corrected the spectra for the elevation dependence of @xmath33 .",
    "the kinetic temperature and the @xmath2co column density were obtained from the spectra using the relations given by dickman ( 1978 ) , assuming that @xmath2co is optically thin , and that both @xmath34 and @xmath2co have the same excitation temperatures .",
    "these relations take into account the 2.7 k microwave background as well as the fact that the usual rayleigh - jeans approximation ( @xmath35 ) is not valid at millimeter wavelengths for the typical kinetic temperatures that obtain in the molecular clouds .",
    "figures 1 to 4 show the distributions of the @xmath2co column density , the kinetic temperature , the equivalent width and the integrated line intensity ( @xmath36 ) in the cloud l1616 .",
    "the @xmath1co spectra were used to obtain the last three quantities while the @xmath2co spectra yielded the first .",
    "the ellipse in figs.@xmath321 to 4 outlines the i band image of the nebula ngc 1788 ( see plate 62 of witt & schild 1986 ) associated with l1616 .",
    "its major and minor axes are @xmath37 and @xmath38 long , respectively .",
    "it is centred at the position of the iras source with @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( hereafter , the _ centre _ ) and oriented @xmath41 with respect to the west .",
    "the star , hd 293815 , of spectral type b9v is the brightest visible member of the cluster of stars illuminating the nebula ngc 1788 .",
    "it lies @xmath42 away from the _ centre _ in the nw direction .",
    "following are the notable features in the maps :    1 .",
    "the @xmath2co column density peaks at @xmath43 west of the _ centre _ with a _ shoulder _ around the nebula and falls off gradually and more or less symmetrically from the peak .",
    "2 .   the temperature distribution is more or less centered on the nebula with its peak at @xmath44 east of the _ centre _ and hence not coincident with the column density peak .",
    "this indicates that the radiation from the stars is the dominant energy source .",
    "the spatial distribution of equivalent widths is more or less symmetrically distributed and has its peak coincident with the column density peak .",
    "fig.3 shows that most parts of the cloud have equivalent line widths greater than @xmath45 .",
    "the contour map of the derived _",
    "integrated @xmath1co line intensity _ distribution in l1616 bears similarity to both @xmath2co column density ( fig.1 ) and kinetic temperature ( fig.2 ) distributions .",
    "for example , the two peaks , one each to the east and west of the _ centre _ , correspond to the temperature and column density peaks , respectively .",
    "this similarity implies that although the @xmath1co integrated line intensity map has column density information , it is substantially altered by the distribution of the temperature in the cloud .",
    "hence , using integrated @xmath1co line intensities to trace the column density distributions of molecular hydrogen is not always reliable .",
    "as stated earlier , one of the primary objectives of the observations was to determine the cloud mass more reliably .",
    "the mass of the cloud estimated from the @xmath2co column density map presented in the previous section using a n@xmath46 to n@xmath47 conversion factor of @xmath48 ( dickman 1978 ) is @xmath49 .",
    "one can also use the integrated @xmath1co line intensity map to determine the cloud mass .",
    "the mass found this way using a value of @xmath50 for the i@xmath51/n@xmath46 ratio ( strong et al .",
    "1988 ) is @xmath52 .",
    "the two mass estimates are in good agreement with each other .",
    "we take their mean , which is @xmath53 , to be the cloud mass .",
    "this agrees well with our rough estimate presented in the beginning , although larger by a factor of @xmath541.15 .",
    "the sfe calculated using this new and more reliably determined cloud mass is @xmath412% ( estimated total mass of the stars / stellar and cloud mass ) .",
    "this is still large compared to the average sfe value of @xmath55 3% ( evans & lada 1991 ) found for the nearby molecular clouds .    one can also obtain the mass from the cloud - averaged line width , provided the cloud is in virial equilibrium . for l1616 ,",
    "since the line is wide over most parts of the cloud , the actual cloud - averaged line width turns out to be @xmath56kms@xmath29 .",
    "the corresponding virial mass required to keep the cloud bound is @xmath57 , five times larger than the estimated mass .",
    "conversely , if the cloud is bound , its detected mass of @xmath53 would imply a cloud - averaged line width of only @xmath58 .",
    "thus , it appears that the energy input from the stars in the cluster is _ fragmenting _ the cloud .",
    "the excess turbulent motions of @xmath59kms@xmath29 over and above that needed for virial equilibrium and the present cloud size of @xmath60pc suggest that the fragmentation is possibly happening for the past 1 to 2 myr .",
    "the spatial distributions of emission in the _ linewings _ shown in fig.5 also indicate the disturbed state of the cloud .",
    "the average emission from the material in the velocity ranges 5.4 to 6.7 kms@xmath29 ( thin ) and 8.7 to 10.4 kms@xmath29 ( thick ) , respectively , are shown superimposed one over the other .",
    "the _ blueshifted _ and _ redshifted _ emissions have large spatial extents and distinct peaks , each a little away from the _",
    "centre_. they clearly indicate that substantial mass motion is present , possibly caused by the activity of the stars in the cluster .",
    "for example , the spherical _ redshifted _ emission , whose peak is coincident with the column density peak , is found to contain @xmath5410% of the cloud mass .",
    "the conclusion that the mass motions in the cloud is substantial is further supported by the coincidence of the column density peak with the line width peak .",
    "it is also consistent with the conclusion of de vries et al .",
    "( 1984 ) who , from a systematic survey of reflection nebulae , found that 60% of the clouds with associated reflection nebulae have broad lines ; the enhanced emission in the wings and local line broadening arise from mass motions due to the dynamical interaction between the molecular cloud and the stars illuminating the nebulae .",
    "incidentally , the energy contained in the mass motions is @xmath61 ergs which is less than @xmath540.1% of the energy radiated by the stars in the cluster over the past few million years .",
    "having found that the cloud l1616 has abnormally high sfe and shows clear signs of disintegration , we set out to determine the possible cause .",
    "its high sfe and cometary appearance suggest an external cause .",
    "figure 6 presents a wide angle view of the portion of the sky around the cloud l1616 showing its cometary tail towards @xmath62 southwest and all nearby stars of spectral type earlier than b2 .",
    "only such stars can affect the morphology and kinematics of nearby clouds significantly as well as cause implosion in them .",
    "table@xmath632 provides the details of these stars taken from the literature ( hirshfeld & sinnott 1985 ) .",
    "the projected tail is directed nearly perpendicular to the galactic plane and its extension points to stars 3 and 4 as possible causes . however ,",
    "when their distances from the cloud and their spectral types are considered , it is clear that star 3 ( @xmath64 orionis , a blue supergiant ) is the most influential one .",
    "its present surface temperature and luminosity estimated from its spectral type ( b0ia ) are @xmath4 28000@xmath32k and @xmath65 , respectively ( allen 1976 ) .",
    "this implies that the spectral type of its main - sequence ( ms ) progenitor is o6 with a mass of @xmath4 @xmath66 and a lifetime of @xmath4 4.3 myr . such a star may have accelerated the cloud through the _ rocket effect _ ( oort & spitzer 1955 ) , as well as causing it to implode and form the star cluster .",
    "earlier works ( e.g. bertoldi 1989 , bertoldi & mckee 1990 ) have shown that a cloud can implode as well as acquire a tail structure in such a process . a simple estimate of the time taken by the cloud to cover the current star - cloud separation of 50 - 70 pc using the typical induced velocities of 10 - 15 kms@xmath29 ( bertoldi and mckee 1990 ) yields a value of @xmath67myr .",
    "this being in good agreement with the expected age of the star @xmath64 orionis suggests that its progenitor could have propelled the cloud l1616 to its present position from an initial location close to the star within the stellar life - time . in the following ,",
    "we proceed to check this suggestion more quantitatively .    using two dimensionless parameters viz .",
    "the column density parameter , @xmath68 , and the initial shock velocity parameter , @xmath69 , bertoldi ( 1989 ) has classified clouds exposed to ionising radiation .",
    "the cloud l1616 , given its radius of @xmath70pc and molecular hydrogen density of 1200@xmath71 , has a value of @xmath72 for @xmath68 .",
    "the upper and lower bounds to its initial distance of 50@xmath32pc ( set by the present projected cloud separation ) and 1@xmath32pc , respectively , constrain @xmath69 to lie between -0.62 to 1.08 .",
    "these values for the parameters place l1616 in region ii of his fig.1 . in this case , almost all of the ionising radiation will be absorbed by the recombining gas streaming off the ionisation front and the ionisation front can be considered thin relative to the cloud size . in this approximation ,",
    "the temporal evolution of the parameters ( mass , radius , ion density , distance and speed ) of a cloud exposed to radiation from a massive star are described by the equations presented in appendix a. there are three unknowns in the problem : the escape velocity of the ionised plasma , @xmath73 , the fractional cloud velocity at present , @xmath74 and the ratio of the initial and the final values of the cloud distance , @xmath75 . however , the latter two are not independent ( as can be seen from equation a4 ) thus reducing the independent unknowns to two .",
    "the only constraint is that the cloud moves from @xmath76 to @xmath77 within the interaction time - scale set by the age of the star .",
    "this is bound by its ms life - time of @xmath544.3 myr and its maximum age of @xmath545 myr .",
    "fig.7 shows a contour plot of the time needed to move to the present separation , taken to be 50@xmath32pc , as a function of @xmath76 and @xmath73 .",
    "for the same value of @xmath73 two initial positions , one closer to the star and another closer to the cloud , result in the same time of travel .",
    "the former solution is preferred as it results in a larger average density enhancement ahead of the shock front ( which goes as @xmath78 ) , thus increasing the chances of external triggering .",
    "although , @xmath76 and @xmath73 can not be uniquely fixed , it is clear that , for reasonable values of these parameters , the progenitor of the star @xmath64 orionis could have caused the propulsion of the cloud to its present position within the stellar life - time .",
    "for a temperature of 10000@xmath32k , the sound speed in the ionised plasma is @xmath79 and , observationally , the plasma in a bright condensation in m16 is found to be streaming with a speed of @xmath80 ( courtes , cruvellier & pottasch , 1962 ) .",
    "hence , we take @xmath73 to be typically between 12 and 15 kms@xmath29 .",
    "the projected and 3-d separation between the star and the cloud are 50@xmath32pc and 70@xmath32pc , respectively . if these are taken to be the lower and upper limits to the distance travelled in the maximum available time of @xmath81myr , along with a corresponding escape speed for the plasma of 12 and 15 kms@xmath29 , the needed initial separations turn out to be 5@xmath82pc and 4@xmath82pc , respectively .",
    "fig.8 shows the variation of the cloud parameters with time for these two cases .",
    "the corresponding initial mass , initial radius and the present speed of the cloud for the two cases are : @xmath83m@xmath84 , 1.29@xmath32pc , 13.1@xmath32kms@xmath29 and @xmath85m@xmath84 , 1.34@xmath32pc , 18.0@xmath32kms@xmath29 , respectively .",
    "for the lower velocity case , the measured radial velocity of @xmath86kms@xmath29 , which includes a galactic differential rotation contribution of @xmath87kms@xmath29 , would imply a proper motion velocity of @xmath88kms@xmath29 .",
    "this would require that its direction of motion makes an angle @xmath89 with respect to the line of sight ( los ) or , equivalently , the difference in the distance to the star and the cloud from the sun is not more than @xmath5415@xmath32pc .",
    "this is within the errors ( @xmath4 20% ) of the estimated distances to @xmath64 orionis and l1616 of 370 pc and 420 pc , respectively .",
    "incidentally , the density @xmath90 behind the shock front varies from 150 to 15 @xmath26 ( see fig.8 ) .",
    "the density ahead of the front @xmath91 is approximately ,    @xmath92 where , @xmath93 s and @xmath94 s are the corresponding sound speeds and temperatures . taking @xmath95 and @xmath96 to be 40 k and 10000 k , respectively , @xmath91 is found to vary from @xmath97 to @xmath98 over the last 5@xmath32myr .",
    "this substantial density enhancement in the frontside of the cloud over a long period could have caused it to implode and form the cluster .",
    "the cloud fragmentation timescale estimated earlier is consistent with this scenario .",
    "a quantity which could have substantiated this further is the tail - stretching timescale .",
    "however , it could not be obtained as no velocity gradient along the tail was discernible .",
    "this may be due to the insufficient velocity resolution used ( @xmath99 at 115 ghz ) .",
    "also , it may be difficult to determine any possible gradient due to the confusion resulting from the mass motions in the cloud generated by the cluster . nevertheless , assuming that the tail makes an angle of @xmath100 with the los and the projected length of the tail is @xmath101pc , the upper limit to the velocity gradient can be translated to a lower limit to the tail stretching time - scale of @xmath102myr .",
    "this agrees with the available travel time , but does not constrain it well . in conclusion ,",
    "the above discussion is consistent with the hypothesis that the star @xmath64 orionis has been the external trigger .",
    "a measurement of the proper motion velocity of hd293815 , the brightest star exciting the reflection nebula , will confirm this .",
    "we shall now summarise our main findings .",
    "our main objectives were to determine the mass of the cloud l1616 and to find out if large scale mass motions are present .",
    "for this purpose , we mapped this cloud in the j = 1 @xmath5 0 transitions of both @xmath1co and @xmath2co .",
    "we have presented the distributions of the @xmath2co column density , the kinetic temperature , the equivalent width and the integrated line intensity in the cloud .",
    "they clearly indicate that the star cluster exciting the reflection nebula is the dominant energy source and that substantial mass motions are present in the cloud .",
    "the masses determined from the maps of @xmath2co column density and @xmath1co integrated line intensity are in agreement with each other and suggest that the mass of the cloud l1616 is @xmath53 .",
    "this confirms the high star formation efficiency suspected in this cloud if the stellar mass estimated from the fir fluxes is reasonably correct .",
    "however , the virial mass estimated from the cloud - averaged line width of @xmath103 is @xmath57 .",
    "this is much larger than the above estimates and suggests that the cloud may be disintegrating .",
    "the evidence for mass motions supports this .",
    "the cometary appearance , the location of the star cluster near the edge facing the bright orion stars , and the estimated high star formation efficiency suggest that the cluster formation may have been externally triggered . the star _",
    "@xmath64 orionis _ located opposite to the tail direction is the most likely external trigger .",
    "it is found that this star could have propelled the cloud from its initial distance to its present position in a time - scale of @xmath545 myr for reasonable values of the two parameters viz . the initial distance to the cloud from the star and the escape velocity of the ionised gas .",
    "if the cluster - formation is externally triggered , the average density enhancement must have been high .",
    "this requires that the cloud was initially close to the star which leads to a large space velocity of @xmath104kms@xmath29 at present .",
    "then , the measured radial velocity requires the cloud to have a proper motion velocity of @xmath105 .",

    "many dense molecular condensations within its stromgren radius ( which is 12@xmath32pc for a star of spectral type o6v for an assumed value of 10@xmath32@xmath26 for the mean hydrogen density of the surrounding medium ) will experience a weak r - type ionisation front passing quickly around them , after which the stellar uv radiation will drive an ionisation front into the denser cloud .",
    "the ionised hydrogen produced on the side of the cloud facing the star , being at a higher pressure than the gas outside owing to its higher density , would expand producing a recoil on the cloud and thus accelerate it away from the star .",
    "the loss of this gas also results in the reduction of the cloud mass , and hence the cloud radius . in this appendix",
    "we derive equations describing how the cloud s position @xmath107 , radius @xmath108 , mass @xmath109 and relative velocity with respect to the star @xmath93 change with time under certain assumptions .",
    "let @xmath110 and @xmath111 , respectively , be the present velocity , mass and radius of the cloud and @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively , be its initial and present distance from the star @xmath64 orionis . integrating the equation of motion , taking @xmath93 to be zero initially , one gets the following result for rocket acceleration ,    @xmath112 here , @xmath113 is @xmath93 expressed as a fraction of @xmath73 , the velocity at which the ionised gas escapes .",
    "the latter is nearly equal to the sound speed in the ionised plasma which is @xmath5411.4 kms@xmath29 . in obtaining the above result we have ignored the deceleration due to sweeping up of matter .",
    "a cloud of radius @xmath541 pc ploughing through a medium with an average hydrogen density of 1 @xmath26 over a distance of @xmath5470 pc would sweep up only a mass of @xmath544 m@xmath84 . since this is much smaller compared to the present cloud mass , deceleration due to",
    "it can be ignored .",
    "this is particularly justified in the case of l1616 because the cloud is at an altitude of @xmath114190 pc while the star @xmath115orionis is at an altitude of @xmath114120 pc ( their galactic longitudes and latitudes are : [ 203.5 , @xmath11624.7 ] and [ 205.2 , @xmath11617.2 ] , respectively ) .",
    "thus , most of its motion would have taken place at high altitudes , nearly perpendicular to the galactic plane , where the general ism density is likely to be quite low resulting in negligible swept - up mass .",
    "the rate at which the cloud loses mass is given by @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is the mass of a proton and @xmath119 is the number density of hydrogen ions just behind the ionisation front ( spitzer 1978 ) . here ,",
    "both @xmath120 and @xmath108 are taken to depend on @xmath113 .",
    "as the cloud recedes from the star , the ionising photon density at the cloud surface will vary and hence cause @xmath120 to vary .",
    "since the cloud loses mass , the cloud radius would also change .",
    "if the mean density is conserved , then @xmath121 is given by ,    @xmath122 assuming that the gas expands spherically and that the recombinations occuring in it nearly completely _ shield _ the stellar uv photons , one obtains the following expression for @xmath119 ( spitzer 1978 ) ,    @xmath123 where , @xmath124 is the stellar output rate of ionising photons and @xmath125 is the effective recombination probability for hydrogen taken to be @xmath126 @xmath127s@xmath29 .",
    "now , equating the mass loss rate to @xmath128 and solving for @xmath129 using the fact that @xmath130 one obtains ,    @xmath131 \\right ) \\\\ \\ni { \\rm where},~~ \\beta~&=&~\\frac{4m_{1}}{m_{p}}~\\sqrt{\\frac{4\\alpha}{3\\pi~n_{c } ~r^{2}_{1}}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is worth noting that , in addition to their boundary values , the cloud variables described by the above equations depend only on @xmath113 and not on @xmath93 or @xmath73 themselves .",
    "the fact that the infinitesimal time @xmath132 taken for the cloud to move by an infinitesimal distance @xmath133 depends on the velocity and acceleration during that period results in the following equation :    @xmath134\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since it was not possible to obtain a closed form solution , we have numerically integrated this equation to get the time as a function of z. in the graphs shown in fig.8 , the time axis was derived in this way .",
