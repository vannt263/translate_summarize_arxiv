    "it becomes non - zero due to color matrices in the internal lines .",
    "the starting expression for scalar loop contribution to three - point correlation function of non - abelean vector field can be found from ( [ 28 ] ) by setting @xmath78 , and changing variables @xmath79 : @xmath80 \\right ] \\mid _ { linear\\ in\\ each\\ \\epsilon } , \\ ] ] here in the first exponent we have used @xmath81 , that is the result of the energy - momentum conservation .",

    "we can write the vector field s three - point correlation functions from the sym theory which includes both the scalar and spinor loop contributions as in the following : [ 119 ] ^abc ( k_1,k_2,k_3 ) = tr ( t^at^bt^c ) ^ ( d ) ( k_l ) _ 0^d_1d_2d_3 + _ 1^i_2^j_3^k e^- ( _ 1_2_3 ) / ( k_i^2/_i )    on the other hand , the three - point function from the @xmath1 supergravity , found in ( [ 24 ] ) , has the form : @xmath184 @xmath185 .\\ ] ] comparing equation ( [ 119 ] ) with the contribution of the first term in the square bracket of ( [ 120 ] ) , we find that they coincide .",
    "second term in square bracket ( [ 120 ] ) , can be written by means of @xmath186 -function as well : @xmath187 = \\ ] ] @xmath188 as we notice , the @xmath189-function term in @xmath95 comes from the contribution of tadpole diagram of scalar loop .",
    "it is cancelled with terms of spinor loop when we sum scalar and spinor contributions .",
    "however , the tadpole diagram of scalar loop was not considered in @xcite and so , here we have got an additional term proportional to @xmath186-function .",
    "so , the second term in ( [ 120 ] ) would be cancelled with the scalar tadpole contribution , if calculations in @xcite took it into account .",
    "this completes the equivalence of ads supergravity and gauge theory worldline approaches to the three point function .",
    "we observed that for the r - current vector fields in the free limit of the sym theory , using the worldline formalism , it is possible to convert the two and three - point functions into the amplitudes in the supergravity theory in the @xmath1 side . by a convenient reparametrization , these expressions are written in terms of bulk to boundary propagators of the corresponding vector field in the @xmath1 .",
    "an analogy with the electrical networks is useful here . in a feynman diagram",
    "one can consider the moduli parameters @xmath190 s as resistances and the momenta as the electrical currents in each internal / external line . now",
    "the reparametrization given in section 4 as @xmath191 is equivalent to the renowned transformation from _ delta _ ( loop ) diagram to _ star _ ( tree ) diagram in the electrical networks . in terms of string theory worldsheet",
    ", it realizes the duality transformation from the one loop open string to the sphere of closed string .",
    "this is important in proposing a geometrical ( in the worldsheet sense ) understanding of the open / closed dualities in string theory .",
    "finally we have shown that the two and three - point functions derived from the sym theory are equivalent to those which come from the bulk by @xmath2 correspondence . although the three - point function has two independent parts which we denoted by @xmath147 and @xmath148 in section 1 , we have shown the correspondence for the @xmath147 part only .",
    "the @xmath148 part in the sym side , comes from the anomaly triangle diagram involving @xmath192 .",
    "the worldline treatment of @xmath192 interactions is well - known and it can be carried on as well .",
    "we believe that the result will match with the @xmath1 calculations , so the open / closed string duality can be implemented completely .",

    "<S> hep - th/0505162    the early idea of @xmath2 correspondence is based on the duality between the supergravity theory in the bulk of @xmath1 spacetime on one side and @xmath0 super yang - mills theory living on the boundary on the other . </S>",
    "<S> an important realization of this correspondence is the derivation of the correlation functions of the boundary theory from the partition function of the bulk theory @xcite . in this connection </S>",
    "<S> the correlation functions in @xmath2 have been studied by different authors @xcite-@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is believed that this duality has a deeper origin in the underlying string theories . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath2 duality is a consequence of the closed / open string duality . </S>",
    "<S> the sym theory on the boundary and supergravity in the bulk are effective theories of open and closed strings , respectively . despite of efforts in understanding this duality in the level of string theories in diverse aspects ( e.g. @xcite ) </S>",
    "<S> , an interesting idea would be revisiting correlation functions and thinking how they could be realized as an closed / open string duality . in this regard , </S>",
    "<S> a worth asking question is whether it is possible to somehow glue up the open string amplitudes corresponding to correlators on the boundary to find the closed string amplitudes in the bulk . </S>",
    "<S> the closed / open string dualities were observed in some specific examples in the context of the topological string theory in @xcite-@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however an affirmative clear answer to this question , in the original @xmath2 conjecture , comes in a series of elegant works by gopakumar in @xcite where the basic tool is the worldline formalism in the limit of weak coupling or free fields ( see also @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the worldline formalism was developed for calculation of field theory correlators at one loop approximation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this formalism is based on the idea of converting the field theory path integrals in one - loop effective action into integrals over the parameters defined at one loop which turns out to be a realization of the open string moduli . </S>",
    "<S> the worldline formalism has found successful applications in field theory problems related to the one - loop effective action @xcite . in @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the worldline formalism was found useful as well for rewriting correlators in terms of open string worldsheet moduli parameters . </S>",
    "<S> this is motivated by the fact that this parametrization comes directly from open string theory in @xmath3 limit . </S>",
    "<S> then an analogy with the electrical networks suggests a reparametrization known as _ delta _ to _ star _ which corresponds to a transformation which converts an open string one loop world sheet to a closed string sphere with holes replaced by closed string vertices . after this reparametrization </S>",
    "<S> , the amplitude can be understood as an amplitude in @xmath1 spacetime which is constructed from bulk to boundary ( as well as bulk to bulk ) propagators in the @xmath1 spacetime . in a free scalar theory </S>",
    "<S> the two and three point correlators in a worldline formulation were written in the form of heat kernel integrals . </S>",
    "<S> after some reparametrization , such integrals obey scalar field equation in @xmath1 spacetime , i.e. they are the bulk to boundary propagators in this spacetime . </S>",
    "<S> the one advantage of this approach is to observe explicitly the footprint of @xmath1 bulk to boundary propagators in field theory correlators . </S>",
    "<S> it realizes the @xmath2 correspondence at the level of free string amplitudes .    </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ]        one may think that the magic of deriving the @xmath1 spacetime structure from a free field theory comes from the simple structure of scalar fields , while in both @xmath0 sym and supergravity theories , we have more complicated objects ( even in free limit ) and investigation of the duality via correlators remains non - obvious . </S>",
    "<S> an interesting early work on the correspondence of non - obvious correlators is @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , where two and three point correlators of r - symmetry currents in @xmath4 super yang - mills theory were obtained and confirmed the @xmath2 correspondence . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we try to implement the ideas of @xcite to r - currents , i.e. in the worldline formalism framework we use the procedure of introducing bulk to boundary propagators via parameter integrals of heat kernel in the two and three point @xmath5-current correlation functions in super yang - mills theory . </S>",
    "<S> the importance of @xmath5-currents , besides their rich structure as vector fields , comes from the fact that they , as well as scalar fields , are protected objects in @xmath0 sym theory by supersymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> this enables us to use them in the free field limit and trust our results in wider limits . </S>",
    "<S> however , we have to restrict ourselves to at most three - point function , since higher n - point functions require bulk to bulk propagators in the @xmath1 space which in turn requires the sum over all string states . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , in three - point function the only relevant propagator is the bulk to boundary propagator and it is enough to consider the lowest string state for this propagator . </S>",
    "<S> the important result is that when one considers the one loop correlation in the sym theory , it is possible to reparametrise it in the same fashion of _ delta _ to _ star _ in the electrical networks and find out an amplitude which corresponds to a tree diagram . </S>",
    "<S> this amplitude is of course the closed string sphere diagram and explicitly can be shown to correspond to an amplitude of the bulk theory .    </S>",
    "<S> this paper is organized as follows . in section 1 </S>",
    "<S> we introduce the r - currents in @xmath6 theory and use the basic results of worldline formalism to derive the two point functions . then in section 2 we investigate the three point function . in section 3 </S>",
    "<S> we introduce the vector field theory in the @xmath1 theory and review the derivation of the r - current correlation functions from the bulk theory . </S>",
    "<S> section 4 is devoted to bringing the results of worldline formalism and @xmath1 supergravity in agreement with each other and we conclude in section 5 . </S>",
    "<S> a very brief review on the worldline formalism is given the appendix . </S>"
