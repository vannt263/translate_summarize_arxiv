    "during the past decade high energy physics received a great impact from theories implying existence of extra dimensions in the world .",
    "these are the string theory @xcite and higher dimensional brane - world scenarios @xcite .",
    "the low energy limit of the string theory can be described by the slope expansion in powers of the inverse string tension ( or of the inverse square of the fundamental string scale @xmath2 ) that produces higher curvature corrections to the einstein action .",
    "the quadratic term in curvature ( given by the so - called gauss - bonnet invariant ) is the leading correction that can affect the graviton excitation spectrum near the flat space .",
    "the extra dimensional scenarios also suggest that the fundamental gravity scale @xmath3 might be around the weak scale @xmath4 .",
    "thus , at particle collisions with the cross section @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the schwarzschild radius , and energies larger than @xmath3 , the production of mini - black holes should start .",
    "these black holes are intrinsically higher dimensional and usually modeled by the tangherlini metric , which is the solution of the d - dimensional einstein equations .",
    "however , in order to have a mathematically noncontradictory gravity in higher dimensions , one has to take account of higher curvature corrections of the same form as those appearing in the slope expansion of the string theory .",
    "the spherically symmetric solution describing neutral static black holes in the d - dimensional einstein gravity with the gb corrections was obtained in @xcite .",
    "this solution contains small corrections to the d - dimensional schwarzschild - tangherlini geometry and consequently properties of such gauss - bonnet corrected black holes were expected to differ only slightly from the schwarzschild s ones .",
    "this happens , for instance , for the spectrum of proper oscillations of these black holes @xcite .",
    "unlike astrophysical black holes , whose hawking evaporation is negligibly small , mini - black holes are intensively evaporating what leads to the very short lifetime of these black holes , once they are created .",
    "the latter is due - to strong production of various particles from the vacuum around a black hole and emission of them through the mechanism of hawking radiation @xcite . at large number of space - time dimensions @xmath1 , the specific `` tensorial '' type of gravitons ( respectively the @xmath7 rotation group ) dominates in the emission process @xcite . up to now",
    ", an impressively extensive literature is devoted to the calculations of hawking evaporation of the schwarzschild - tangherlini and myers - perry black holes @xcite , while evaporation of their higher curvature corrected generalizations was touched upon only in a couple of works @xcite . in particular ,",
    "t.  rizzo estimated the energy - emission rate for the higher curvature corrected black holes , assuming that the grey - body factor equals unity @xcite . this was expected to give the correct answer about the order of the intensity of the hawking emission .",
    "though , as we shall show in this paper , the contribution due to the grey - body factors can also considerably change the results . in @xcite ,",
    "the scattering of standard model particles around gauss - bonnet black holes was considered , though the calculations were terminated at the grey - body factors and the numbers of particles per frequency .",
    "thus , none of the above works calculated the energy - emission rate for gauss - bonnet black holes that is necessary for the estimation of the total emission of energy and thus of the black hole lifetime . here we shall fill this gap and calculate the energy - emission rates for fields of various spin , including gravitons , and thus shall estimate the lifetime of gauss - bonnet black holes .    in this work",
    ", we shall show that due to a number of reasons , the emission of the tensor type of gravitons is greatly ( in fact exponentially ) suppressed when one turns on the gb coupling @xmath8 .",
    "thus , even at small values of the gb coupling constant @xmath8 _ the graviton emission is suppressed by many orders_. this means that small gb corrections lead to a much longer life of higher dimensional black holes than was expected @xcite . at first sight",
    "this enormous suppression would not seem trustworthy : why do slight corrections of geometry produce a very strong effect on the evaporation process ?",
    "the reasons for this are `` multiplication '' of the two factors .",
    "first , the black hole gets much colder when one turns on the gb coupling and the emission rate is quadratic in temperature .",
    "second , the emission is proportional to the grey - body factor which is exponentially suppressed for tensorial gravitons .",
    "this explanation certainly did not make us trust the result immediately .",
    "therefore we reproduced our accurate numerical calculations by the semianalytical wkb estimations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : sec [ sec : wave - like ] briefly discuss the deduction of wave equations for perturbations of fields of various spin .",
    "sec [ sec : methods ] is devoted to numerical calculation of the coefficients of transmission , while sec .",
    "[ sec : wkb ] gives wkb values of the coefficients . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] the obtained scattering data are used for the calculations of the energy - emission rates . using the wkb arguments sec .",
    "[ sec : discussions ] explains why the found enormous suppression of hawking evaporation occurs . in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we estimate the lifetime of gauss - bonnet corrected black holes and outline the future perspective for this direction .",
    "we shall consider the canonical ensemble , which leads to the same results as the microcanonical one if the black hole mass @xmath9 is at least a few times larger than @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the einstein - gauss - bonnet action is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the coupling constant ; @xmath13 .",
    "the metric has the form , @xmath14 @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the line element of a unit @xmath17-sphere and @xmath18 . as we mentioned earlier",
    ", we shall measure all quantities in terms of the black hole horizon radius , which we shall denote as @xmath19 , so that the black hole mass can be written as @xmath20    the linearized perturbations of ( [ metric ] ) can be written in the general form as @xmath21 indices of @xmath22 are raised using the background metric ; therefore @xmath23 the first order variation of the riemann tensors is : @xmath24    using the symmetry of the background metric , one can decompose the perturbation equations into scalars , vectors and tensors according to the rotation group on the @xmath17-sphere @xcite . then",
    ", the separation of angular variables is possible for this case @xcite .",
    "after separation of the angular variables and implying stationarity , @xmath25 , the dynamics of the gravitational perturbations can be reduced to the wavelike equations @xcite , @xmath26 with the effective potentials which have a very cumbersome form .",
    "after some algebra , we managed to simplify the potentials obtained by dotti and collaborators in @xcite for the tensor , vector , and scalar types of the gravitational perturbation , respectively :    @xmath27    here we used the following dimensionless quantities : @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 is the eigenvalue of the angular part of the laplacian , @xmath31 .    a wide class of static black holes in the einstein gravity is known to be stable against gravitational perturbations for any number of space - time dimensions @xcite .",
    "this is not true for black holes in the einstein - gauss - bonnet theory which suffer from instability for sufficiently large ( in units of the radius of the event horizon ) values of the gb coupling @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "we shall consider here only small enough values of the gb coupling @xmath32 which are below the threshold of the gravitational instability @xcite .",
    "in other words , we shall be limited by not very small masses of black holes @xmath9 , which usually are at least one order larger than @xmath3 .",
    "we shall also consider the test scalar field in the background ( [ metric ] ) which satisfies the klein - gordon equation @xmath33    after separation of the angular variables the equation ( [ klein - gordon ] ) can be reduced to the wavelike form ( [ wave - like ] ) with the following effective potential @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "let us note , that unlike the schwarzschild black hole , the gauss - bonnet black hole has the effective potential for the scalar field ( [ testscalar - pot ] ) which differs from the effective potentials for the tensor - type gravitational perturbations ( [ tensor - pot ] ) . in the limit @xmath37 ( [ testscalar - pot ] )",
    "coincides with ( [ tensor - pot ] ) .",
    "in addition , we shall consider the standard model fields ( scalars , fermions and gauge bosons ) living on a 4-dimensional brane , which is embedded in the background of the gauss - bonnet black hole .",
    "the induced metric on the brane is given by a projection of the metric ( [ metric ] ) onto the 4-brane @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the line element of a unit sphere .",
    "the effective potential for the scalar field ( [ klein - gordon ] ) in the metric ( [ projected - metric ] ) is @xmath40    the massless gauge field satisfies the equation @xmath41    after the separation of the angular variables , one can find the effective potential for the two types of the polarizations @xmath42 where @xmath43 .    for the fermions we do not consider the equation in the standard schrdinger wavelike form because of the boundary conditions",
    ": we will calculate the grey - body factors for neutrinos and antineutrinos using the approach of @xcite .",
    "that is why we use here the equation for the radial part in the following form    @xmath44    where @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "in order to calculate the intensity of the hawking radiation , one should first calculate the gray - body factors , that is , to solve the problem of classical scattering around black holes with pure in - going boundary conditions at the event horizon .",
    "the latter is reduced to the finding of the s - matrix , or , simply , of the reflection or the transmission coefficients .      at the event horizon",
    "we impose the boundary condition that corresponds to the purely ingoing wave @xmath47 at the spatial infinity ( @xmath48 ) the two linearly independent solutions of the wavelike equation ( [ wave - like ] ) are @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are integration constants which correspond to the ingoing and outgoing waves respectively . introducing the new function @xmath52 and choosing the integration constant as @xmath53",
    "we expand the equation ( [ wave - like ] ) near the event horizon and find @xmath54 , which completely determines initial conditions for the numerical integration .",
    "then , we integrate numerically the equation ( [ wave - like ] ) from the event horizon @xmath19 until some distant point @xmath55 and find a fit for the numerical solution far from the black hole in the form @xmath56 where the asymptotical expansions for the corresponding functions are found by expanding ( [ wave - like ] ) for large @xmath57 as @xmath58    the fitting procedure allows us to find the coefficients @xmath50 and @xmath51 . in order to check the accuracy of the calculated coefficients one should increase the internal precision of the numerical integration procedure , the value of @xmath59 and the number of terms in the series expansion for @xmath60 and @xmath61 , making sure that the values of @xmath50 and @xmath51 do not change within the desired precision .",
    "another way to check our numerical calculations is to compare the fraction @xmath62 with the result provided by the 6-th order wkb method , which gives quite an accurate answer for large and moderate values of @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "the wkb approach was initially used for finding quasinormal modes for which it usually provides quite a good accuracy at the 6th order @xcite    the reflection coefficient , given by the wkb formula , is @xmath64 here @xmath65 is the maximum of the effective potential , @xmath66 is the second derivative of the effective potential in its maximum with respect to the tortoise coordinate , and @xmath67 are higher order wkb corrections which depend on up to the @xmath68-th order derivatives of the effective potential at its maximum .    from fig .",
    "[ fig - wkbcheck ] we see that the difference between the results found by these two methods is a fraction of a percent .",
    "unfortunately , for some values of the parameters the effective potential does not have the form of a peak ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - scalarpot ] ) . in these cases",
    "the wkb formula can not be used in the present form .",
    "that is why , despite in most cases the wkb formula provides a good approximation , we use a numerical integration procedure which works for any form of the effective potential .    , @xmath69 ( blue , top line ) , @xmath70 ( green , middle line ) , and @xmath71 ( red , bottom line ) .",
    "]                                  when the coefficients @xmath50 and @xmath51 are obtained , one can find the absorption probability @xmath72 where the multiplicity factors @xmath73 are @xcite @xmath74 for the gravitational perturbations of tensor , vector and scalar types .",
    "the hawking temperature is @xmath75      the scalar field living in the bulk has the same number of the degrees of freedom as the gravitational perturbations of scalar type @xmath76 for the scalar field localized on the brane the multiplicity factor is given @xmath77    for the gauge field the multiplicity factor is the same for each polarization @xmath78    for the neutrinos and antineutrinos the multiplicity factor is @xmath79    in order to calculate the absorption probability for the fermions we use the approach of @xcite @xmath80 the energy - emission rate for the neutrinos and antineutrinos is the same and given by @xmath81    note that we take into account contributions of neutrinos and antineutrinos and both polarizations of the gauge bosons .",
    "that is why our result is two times larger than in @xcite .",
    "[ cols= \" > , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]",
    "in fig . [ fig - d6 ] one can see that the energy - emission rate per unit frequency @xmath82 for gravitons strongly decreases as @xmath83 increases , leading to suppression of about five times for @xmath84 .",
    "examples of contributions of various multipoles and of various types of gravitons ( scalar , vector and tensor ) are given in figs .",
    "[ fig - d6a2 ] , [ fig - d6contrib ] , [ fig - d5 ] , [ fig - d8 ] , [ fig - d9 ] , [ fig - d11 ] .",

    "[ fig - d10 ] one can see contributions of brane - localized standard model fields into the energy - emission rate : for @xmath86 the larger spin of a field , the larger is the corresponding energy - emission rate per unit frequency around its maximum .",
    "an important observation for our future discussion is about the role of the tensor type of gravitons in the evaporation process . for vanishing gb coupling",
    "the tensor type of gravitons corresponds to the highest energy - emission rate , which leads to the dominance of tensorial gravitons among all particles in the hawking radiation at large @xmath1 ( see figs .",

    "are qualitatively the same . ]    finally , let us justify here in more detail why we chose the units of the fixed event horizon and not the units of the fixed black hole mass .",
    "first , we would like to mention that from the values in units of the black hole radius , using a simple formula which we shall show in the next section , we are always able to recalculate values of the energy - emission rate in units of the black hole mass or planck mass .",
    "the inverse formula is not so simple because the mass appears in the left - hand side as well .",
    "second , in order to calculate the energy - emission rate in units of the mass , we must fix in some way the real planck mass , which we do not yet know .",
    "third , the purpose of the table [ thetable ] is to show that , independently on the new planck mass , the energy - emission rate decreases some orders .",
    "this is a general result , which we would lose if we fix the planck mass in some way . in order to show this effect we present a figure in the units of tevs to illustrate how the emission rate depends on the back hole mass ( fig .",
    "[ fig - eermass ] ) .     for @xmath85 . ]",
    "@xmath91 , @xmath92.,title=\"fig:\"]@xmath93 , @xmath92.,title=\"fig:\"]@xmath94     for @xmath95 . ]",
    "( @xmath85 , @xmath92 , @xmath96 ) . ]",
    "from fig . [ fig - tensor ] and table [ thetable ] one can see that the energy - emission rate decreases quickly ( in fact , almost exponentially ) with @xmath32 . in order to understand why this happens for relatively small corrections to the black hole geometry",
    "let us use the wkb approach and consider the cases of small and large @xmath82 of separately .",
    "the numerical data , which we obtained here ( table [ thetable ] ) , do not use the small @xmath82 expansion of @xcite and are , thereby , more accurate .    when @xmath97 , the energy - emission rate decreases due to the suppression of the grey - body factor for tensor gravitons . in order to show this we use the wkb approximation . for @xmath98",
    "the wkb formula reads @xmath99 . on fig .",
    "[ fig - potential ] we see that the leading order of @xmath32 increases the height of the potential barrier , as well as the distance between the turning points . then",
    ", from ( [ wkbformula ] ) it is clear that that the grey - body factor decreases exponentially as the effective potential for tensor gravitons grows .    in the eikonal approximation for @xmath100 one",
    "has @xmath101 as the height of the potential increases with growing @xmath32 , the dominant contribution comes from the numerator and the grey - body factor for tensor gravitons is @xmath102 for large values of @xmath82 it is evident that @xmath103 .",
    "thus , the dominant contribution to the energy - emission rate at large @xmath82 comes from the temperature , which decreases as ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - temperature ] ) @xmath104 therefore the energy - emission rate decreases exponentially with @xmath32 @xmath105    let us compare the hawking radiation of schwarzschild and gb black holes produced due to particle collisions of the same energy .",
    "the relation between the black hole mass @xmath9 and its radius @xmath19 is given by @xmath106 where @xmath10 is the true fundamental scale of gravity . in units of the black hole horizon the energy - emission rate @xmath107 .",
    "if we measure the black hole radius in units of @xmath108 , the energy - emission rate is measured in units of @xmath109 . in order to convert the energy - emission rate in the units of @xmath110",
    ", we divide it by the plank constant @xmath111 . for @xmath112 and @xmath87 , the total energy - emission rate of gb black holes can be as much as @xmath113 times smaller ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - eermass ] ) than that of the schwarzschild one . for other values of @xmath1",
    "the increase in the lifetime of black holes can be easily calculated in the same way .",
    "thus , we have shown that even small gb corrections to the @xmath1-dimensional schwarzschild geometry lead to the great increasing of the lifetime of black holes , up to quite a few orders .",
    "this is certainly not enough for accreting of matter and thus is not dangerous for experiments at the lhc , yet , it will produce a potentially observable effect .",
    "a natural question is , what is the fraction of the contribution of the grey - body factor into suppression of emission of the tensorial gravitons , and consequently into overall lifetime of black holes .",
    "an exact answer is , however , not as easy as it drastically depends on a number of conditions : the mass of the black hole @xmath9 , the value of the gb coupling @xmath32 , the number of space - time dimensions @xmath1 and is strongly connected with the dominance of a particular type of particles for fixed @xmath32 , @xmath9 , @xmath1 .    a brief hint could be given by the plot of the grey - body factor as a function of @xmath32 , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - greybody ] .",
    "for example , the grey - body factor for @xmath85 can be suppressed at the rate of about 35% for sufficiently small @xmath114 , which is one tenth of its threshold values of instability @xcite .",
    "going beyond very small values of @xmath32 would require inclusion of corrections of higher orders of curvature in the action .",
    "thus , the first factor of the two which was mentioned in the abstract of this article , i.e. the quick cooling of a black hole when @xmath32 grows , is definitely a dominant factor of suppression of the hawking radiation .",
    "let us note that the suppression of the energy - emission rate at high @xmath82 due to the cooling of a black hole was observed in @xcite for the standard model particles .",
    "though the largest suppression of the graviton emission reported in @xcite is at @xmath115 . in this regime",
    "however one can not trust the solution ( [ metric ] ) , which is gravitationally unstable @xcite .",
    "the other factor , the decreasing of the grey - body factors of the tensorial gravitons , seemingly increased the suppression of the graviton emission at small @xmath32 .",
    "we have shown that the widely accepted approximation of higher dimensional black holes by their classical schwarzschild - tangherlini model is not good , when one considers the hawking radiation around a black hole .",
    "intensive hawking emission of gravitons , as well as of other particles , is suppressed by many orders , when one takes into consideration small quantum gauss - bonnet corrections .",
    "consequently , the lifetime of quantum corrected black holes is many orders larger than it is expected according to the current literature @xcite .",
    "this makes further investigations of hawking radiation of higher curvature corrected black holes appealing .",

    "<S> dictated by the string theory and various higher dimensional scenarios , black holes in @xmath0-dimensional space - times must have higher curvature corrections . the first and dominant term is quadratic in curvature , and called the gauss - bonnet ( gb ) term . </S>",
    "<S> we shall show that although the gauss - bonnet correction changes black hole s geometry only softly , the emission of gravitons is suppressed by many orders even at quite small values of the gb coupling . </S>",
    "<S> the huge suppression of the graviton emission is due to the multiplication of the two effects : the quick cooling of the black hole when one turns on the gb coupling and the exponential decreasing of the grey - body factor of the tensor type of gravitons at small and moderate energies . at higher @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> the tensor gravitons emission is dominant , so that the overall lifetime of black holes with gauss - bonnet corrections is many orders larger than was expected . </S>",
    "<S> this effect should be relevant for the future experiments at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) . </S>"
