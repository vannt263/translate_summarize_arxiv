    "an international array of first - generation long - baseline laser interferometric gravitational - wave ( gw ) detectors ( ligo  @xcite , virgo  @xcite , geo  @xcite and tama  @xcite ) are reaching their design sensitivities .",
    "these michelson interferometers have been built to measure gw - driven relative length changes ( within a detection band from 10hz to 10khz ) between the mirror - endowed test masses which are hung as pendulums with an eigenfrequency far below the detection band .",
    "resonant cavities are used to enhance the sensitivity by increasing the circulating optical power and the signal storage time . in michelson interferometers usually the total differential mode of motion between the arm cavity mirrors , in the following always represented by the position operator @xmath3 ( for the nomenclature see fig.[fig : advligo ] ) is measured via a homodyne detection of the modulation fields ( also called side - band fields ) leaking out at the dark port of the interferometer .",
    "current gw interferometers are already quantum limited at high frequencies by the shot noise .",
    "next generation interferometers , such as the planned advanced ligo detector  @xcite ( cf .",
    "fig.[fig : advligo ] ) , are expected to be quantum noise limited at nearly all frequencies in the detection band .",
    "advanced ligo will therefore operate at its free mass _ standard quantum limit _",
    "( sql )  @xcite at which the back - action noise is comparable to the shot noise level .",
    "the position - referred spectral density of the sql at the sideband frequency @xmath4 is given by @xmath5 the sql is the minimum noise spectrum achievable by a linear quantum measurement of the position with uncorrelated sensing and back - action noise . here",
    "@xmath6 is the reduced mass of all arm cavity mirrors , or @xmath7 of the individual mirror mass .",
    "improvement of sensitivities to gws beyond advanced ligo will require to surpass the sql significantly in a broad frequency band .",
    "various conceptual strategies exist for building interferometers with broadband sub - sql quantum noise  @xcite , while there is also much effort devoted to lowering classical noise below the sql .",
    "for example , ( i ) the clio interferometer is currently being cooled down to a few tens of kelvin , and has a theoretical thermal noise budget below the sql  @xcite , ( ii ) non - spherical mirrors are being developed that support non - gaussian modes which average better over mirror surfaces and are thus less susceptible to thermal noise  @xcite , ( iii ) coating structures are also being optimized for coating thermal noise  @xcite .",
    "this paper , however , is devoted not to the improvement of the detector s sensitivity to gws , but to the study of quantum mechanical behavior of its test masses .",
    "recently , it has been reported by the ligo scientific collaboration in ref .",
    "@xcite that a certain ( controlled ) mode of the mirror s differential motion in the ligo detector located in hanford was experimentally cooled down to @xmath8k , with an effective occupation number of around 200 .",
    "furthermore , there is a number of other experiments considering different smaller - scale mechanical structures  @xcite .",
    "the goal of such _ cold damping _",
    "@xcite experiments is to reach the oscillator s ground state . as a real pure quantum state",
    "is approached , the semiclassical model as used in the above references will certainly break down and the quantum noise effects in the measurement process have to be included .",
    "one aim of this paper is at providing a mathematical foundation guiding future experimental efforts of quantum - state preparation  one that is straightforward to apply to experimental situations .",
    "note that our general formulation applies not only to gravitational - wave detectors but to the whole bunch of experiments related to quantum state preparation .",
    "quantum mechanically , we consider a problem in which an object is being continuously measured by the optical field , while it is simultaneously subject to noisy forces .",
    "for such problems , the stochastic master equation ( sme )  @xcite is a readily available tool to simulate quantum - state preparation in quantum mechanical systems ; a riccati equation associated with the sme provides the remaining uncertainty of the object , when all measurement data are taken into account . formally , this approach only treats markovian systems ( since only markovian systems allow us to project the optical field being measured and trace off the noise fields at every infinitesimal time step , resulting in a closed - form evolution of the test - mass density operator ) , while non - markovianity is prevalent in experiments such as in gw detectors : virtually none of the noise sources are white , and we have the added complexity that the cavity mode often couples strongly with the test masses , i.e. it can not be _ adiabatically eliminated _  @xcite , and must be evolved together with the test masses . since we only consider linear systems with gaussian noise , and we only care about the test masses state after the initial transient has died down , the sme and the riccati equation , which also characterizes the exact way of the transient decays , are not entirely necessary .",
    "instead , we have found that a wiener filtering approach , in which the measurement data is filtered with the optimal causal wiener filter to obtain instantaneous optimal estimates for position and momentum of the test masses  @xcite , suffices , and is most straightforwardly connected with experimental calibration of the system .",
    "an example of the power of the wiener filtering approach has already been demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , where an optimal controller that yields a steady quantum state with minimum uncertainty ( or von neumann entropy ) has been derived for a general linear ( markovian as well as non - markovian ) quantum measurement process .",
    "a direct application of the wiener filtering approach is to explore how quantum a macroscopic test mass can be prepared in a certain environment , which is the second aim of this paper .",
    "we measure the _ purity _ of the quantum state of an individual test mass ( or a single mechanical degree of freedom ) through the heisenberg uncertainty product or the following quantity @xmath9 which is unity for a pure state .",
    "this quantity can also be converted into an effective occupation number .",
    "here @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the second - order moments of position and momentum of the gaussian state .",
    "we will show that a low classical noise budget which is completely below the sql for a broad frequency band allows the quantity @xmath13 to become close to unity .",
    "in particular for simple systems with a total classical noise spectrum @xmath14 which is dominated by a white sensing noise and a white force , we have obtained the simple relation @xmath15 but we will also explore how a realistic noise budget for the planned advanced ligo detector  as well as an extension of advanced ligo with plausible improvement  can best be taken advantage of through an optimized optical configuration that minimizes @xmath13 .",
    "when two independent mechanical degrees of freedom are considered , the formalism , which we present in this paper , has already been applied to show that the production of quantum entanglement between the macroscopic end mirrors is possible for sub - sql laser interferometers  @xcite .",
    "an experiment testing mqm should be divided into different stages which are separated in time : a preparation stage , where the test mass will be continuously observed ; an optional free - evolution stage ; and a verification stage .",
    "one will need to collect statistics from a huge number of identical trials as it is required from quantum mechanics .",
    "this present paper is the first one of a paper - series : this one deals with the preparation of macroscopic conditional quantum states ; while a second paper  @xcite will study the verification of such macroscopic quantum states .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec.[sec : wiener ] we will briefly review the theoretical basics of wiener filtering . in sec.[sec : marko ] we will study analytically the conditional variances of the simplified model using only markovian dynamics . we will introduce a flexible homodyne detection angle and input squeezing . in sec.[sec : macroent ] we will extend the analysis done in ref .",

    ". these preliminary studies result in an investigation of quantum - state preparation in advanced ligo in sec.[sec : advligo ] .",
    "finally , in sec.[sec : con ] we will summarize our main conclusions .",
    "for systems under continuous measurement , the conventional approach is to describe the joint system - measurement - data evolution using a _ stochastic master equation _ ( sme )  @xcite , which is a set of stochastic differential equations that simulates the joint evolution of the system s _ conditional density matrix _ @xmath16 and measurement data @xmath17 . as the simplest example",

    "the _ conditional quantum state _  @xcite is defined as the projection of the joint system - device quantum state to the sub - space in which the readout observable @xmath21 has definite values of @xmath22 .",
    "the wiener increment @xmath23 describes a stochastic process that simultaneously drives the conditional quantum state and the measurement data , where both are stochastic processes .",
    "different realizations of @xmath23 correspond to different possible scenarios that could take place in reality .    in practice",
    ", it is not enough to only describe the stochastic process , we need to be able to obtain the conditional quantum state at any given time @xmath24 , based on the system s initial quantum state @xmath25 and measurement results @xmath26 .",
    "this corresponds to a _ filtering problem _ in classical stochastic calculus .",

    "the former can be obtained through a linear filter over @xmath21 , while the latter can be obtained by solving a time - domain riccati equation . if the measurement process has started for sufficiently long time  much longer than the time constant of transients",
    " then the filters over @xmath21 as well as the second - order moments are stationary .",

    "although the most general theory of quantum filtering is quite distinct from classical filtering  @xcite , we will simplify the situation through two steps , and return to an essentially classical filtering problem .",
    "first , let us construct a model of the quantum measurement process .",
    "let @xmath30 be the _ heisenberg operator _ of the measurement output ( e.g. , a particular quadrature of the out - going optical field ) and @xmath31 any system observable .",
    "then the principle of simultaneous measurability , i.e. the observable @xmath32 at different times can be measured individually to arbitrary accuracy without imposing any fundamental limits , and the principle of causality , i.e. measurement observable at present does not respond to future forces to be exerted onto the system , will dictate that  @xcite @xmath33 \\quad \\forall t , t'\\ , ,   \\label{eq : comyy } \\\\ 0 & = [ \\hat o(t),\\ , \\hat y(t ' ) ] \\quad \\forall t > t'\\ , .",

    "second , we restrict ourselves to _ stable _ linear systems with gaussian states and to later times when the initial states are no longer important . in this case",
    "only first- and second - order moments in linear observables need to be considered .",
    "we also assume all linear observables to have zero unconditional expectation values .",
    "suppose we have observables @xmath41 with @xmath42 , and proceed as in classical wiener filtering .",

    "in fact , for realistic systems with multiple colored noise sources and non - markovian dynamics , smes can only be obtained by increasing the dimension of the problem , which will definitely become cumbersome .",
    "let us start our discussion generally with an abstract continuous linear markovian measurement process , which monitors the center of mass position of a simple harmonic oscillator .",
    "the heisenberg equations of motion in the frequency domain can be written as @xmath85 where the two noise operators @xmath86 and @xmath87 both have a white spectrum . in the time domain ,",
    "@xmath86 and @xmath87 are white noise , with two - time correlation functions proportional to delta function .",
    "such statistical characteristics make the measurement process a markovian one .",
    "thus , we assume that @xmath86 and @xmath87 have the single - sided ( cross- ) spectral densities @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , which satisfy the heisenberg relation of the measurement process  @xcite @xmath91 which arises from the requirement that the heisenberg operators of the out - going field at different times must commute , and guarantees that the level of back action is just enough to enforce the heisenberg uncertainty relation of the test mass  @xcite .",
    "in the case of gaussian noise only , we have @xmath92 if and only if the measurement process is purely quantum .",
    "the linear response function of a damped harmonic oscillator is given by @xmath93 with the eigenfrequency @xmath94 , the damping rate @xmath95 and the mass @xmath6 .",
    "then we can easily assemble the single - sided spectral densities of the measurement process as @xmath96 where we have defined the coefficients @xmath97 both , @xmath98 , have the dimension of frequency squared , while @xmath99 is always positive .",
    "we also note that @xmath100 .    from eq .",
    "we can recover a quantum limit of the measurement process : if we have @xmath101 , the spectral density of the measurement noise satisfies @xmath102 for a free mass we can then recover eq . from eq .. note that for the free mass the first inequality sign in eq .",
    "becomes an equality sign at @xmath103 , where the measurement frequency is defined by @xmath104 therefore , the measurement frequency @xmath105 is the frequency at which the noise spectral density of a markovian quantum measurement process ( with @xmath106 ) approaches most its free mass sql .",
    "now it is straightforward to derive the conditional variances assuming @xmath107 and using the wiener filtering method , i.e. eq .. for this it has actually been crucial to first spectral factorize @xmath108 . in the perfect oscillator limit with @xmath109 the conditional _ covariance matrix _",

    ", the matrix @xmath113 sets the scale of the quantum fluctuations to be comparable to those of the vacuum state of a harmonic oscillator with eigenfrequency @xmath114 .",
    "depending on the ratio @xmath115 , which always lies between @xmath116 and @xmath117 , the noise ellipse of the vacuum state is deformed into one where position and momentum are correlated ( unless if @xmath118 ) while the area is conserved .",
    "this corresponds to a unitary transformation among gaussian states .",

    "we have found that the conditional variances completely coincide with those obtained from smes . with eq .",
    "we can for instance easily reproduce eqs.(2.8a)(2.8c ) from ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a gaussian state is pure if and only if its uncertainty product is heisenberg - limited .",
    "therefore , it makes sense to quantify the purity of the conditional state by its uncertainty product , here given by @xmath120 which is identical to the purity of the measurement process .",
    "this simply shows that in the markovian case , any measurement will produce a pure conditional state of a lossless harmonic oscillator if and only if it is a quantum measurement .",
    "moreover , the uncertainty product is even independent of the system s mechanical properties such as the oscillator s mass and eigenfrequency .",
    "note that in the appendix[sec : neff ] we have introduced how the uncertainty product is related to an effective occupation number @xmath121 .",

    "but this is strictly forbidden due to the heisenberg uncertainty principle . however , in a certain limit they can become very close  @xcite . with a higher difference in @xmath125 and @xmath99 the correlation in @xmath18 and @xmath123 increases  and in turn also the uncertainty product .    in order to obtain the conditional state , as given in eq .",

    "let us now have a closer look on the noise model we will use throughout this section .",
    "we will only consider quantum measurement processes and categorize the noise into two groups : _",
    "( i ) _ the one which is a result of the measurement process itself will be denoted by _ quantum noise _ ; and _ ( ii ) _ the additional noise will be called _ classical noise _ which does not directly arise from the measurement process , usually has no correlation in @xmath86 and @xmath87 does not have to satisfy eq .. then the two noise sources combine as @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "the quantum noise is dominated at high frequencies by shot noise which is covered by @xmath133 and at low frequencies by back - action noise which is covered by @xmath134 .",
    "the latter one is represented by the radiation - pressure noise in the case of a measurement with light .",
    "if both are uncorrelated , i.e. @xmath135 , they result in the sql .",

    "sndmarkov ] .",
    "the quantum noise touches the free - mass sql at the frequency @xmath136 .",
    "the other noise source can also be divided into two parts : a _ classical force noise _",
    "@xmath137 is added to @xmath138 which acts directly on the center of mass of the measured object , and is in real interferometric experiments due to for instance seismic noise or thermal noise in the suspension of the mirrors . the _",
    "classical sensing noise _",
    "@xmath139 is only a pseudo motion of the measured object and may be due to the following reasons : _ ( i ) _ on the one hand due to thermal fluctuations of the mirror s shape as for example mirror internal thermal noise which makes only the mirror surface move with respect to its center of mass ; or _",
    "( ii ) _ on the other hand be due to optical losses ; or _ ( iii ) _ due to photo - detection inefficiency",
    ". therefore , our sensing noise is somehow generalized from what is conventionally understood when using the term `` sensing noise '' .",
    "note that for detecting gravitational waves , only the _ total noise _ matters , yet for studying quantum - state preparation , it is important to make distinctions between sensing and force noise , and between quantum and classical noise . throughout this section",
    "we will assume both classical noise sources to have a white spectrum .",
    "then they can be characterized by the frequencies , @xmath140 for the force noise and @xmath141 for the sensing noise , at which their noise spectral density intersects with the free - mass sql ( cf .",

    "these classical noise frequencies are defined by the following relations @xmath142 note that the classical force noise together with the classical sensing noise can open a window in which both are below the free - mass sql as indicated by the gray - shadowed region in fig.[fig : sndmarkov ] .",

    "this defines the _ conditional ground state of a free mass _ @xmath161 here the wiener filter functions for position and momentum become equal to simple decaying cosine functions at the measurement frequency and read @xmath162 then it becomes apparent that the inverse of the measurement frequency @xmath105 ( at which the total noise approaches sql the most ) is also the time scale at which information regarding test - mass position and momentum have to be extracted from the output data .",
    "it is clear from eq . that one should measure the phase quadrature , i.e. @xmath163 , in order to minimize the uncertainty product .",
    "that means that in order to obtain a small uncertainty product , it is not required to remove the quantum back - action noise from the output , as one would benefit from when trying to detect gravitational waves  @xcite  to the contrary , for that purpose it would be even destructive to do so .",
    "this is understandable , since here the aim is to learn as much as possible about the mirror motion , and the effect of quantum back action is an important content of the mirror motion .",
    "for example , suppose we chose to measure a back - action - evading observable using an oscillator with negligible classical noise . in this case , we would have an output channel that has a minimal power spectrum , and is hence ideal for measuring any classical force that acts onto the mirror .",
    "fluctuation in the mirror motion and the momentum driven by back action , on the other hand , would almost diverge around the resonant frequency .",
    "the output field , containing absolutely no information about the back action , would not be able to remove this fluctuation via conditioning .",
    "this would then result in a conditional state equal to the unconditional state with very large variances .",
    "we learn from eqs. that the effect of the classical force noise in the conditional variances is suppressed with a higher measurement frequency ( random force has less time to act and accumulate ) while the classical sensing noise is suppressed with a lower measurement frequency ( random sensing noise has longer time to average out ) .",
    "moreover , in the absence of any classical sensing noise the test - mass state becomes pure with an infinitely strong measurement ( in which @xmath105 approaches @xmath164 ) : all classical forces acting on the test mass can be neglected in presence of the strong back - action force and the test mass reaches the conditional ground state at the infinite measurement frequency .",
    "vice versa , in the theoretical absence of classical force noise , the test - mass state becomes pure in the limit of an infinitely weak measurement ( in which @xmath105 approaches 0 ) : if the test - mass motion is only driven by the measurement s back action but this motion is then unfortunately hidden in the measurement output because it is covered by the classical sensing noise , the best idea would be not to measure the test mass at all .",
    "if both classical noise sources are present , the uncertainty product is minimized further with an optimal power which accomplishes a balancing between classical force and sensing noise , i.e. with @xmath165 .",
    "this produces an equal sign in the second line of eq . and is true for a measurement frequency of @xmath166 .",
    "this simply means that the quantum noise should touch the free - mass sql at the frequency where the classical noise has the maximal separation to that limit ( cf .",
    "fig.[fig : sndmarkov ] ) .",
    "the expression of the minimal uncertainty product and the one of the minimal effective occupation number are then functions of the classical - noise - sql - beating factor .",
    "for a mechanical object there is not a fundamental definition of which state is vacuum , since it is possible to vary the potential well it lies in .",
    "nevertheless , states with non - zero correlation among displacement and momentum can always be regarded as squeezed , and we can often discuss whether one state is more position squeezed ( momentum anti - squeezed ) or more position anti - squeezed ( momentum squeezed ) compared to another .",
    "we have illustrated the squeezing situation , by plotting noise ellipses obtained with various homodyne detections ( see upper panel of fig.[fig : sqhom ] ) .",
    "as the homodyne detection angle @xmath147 vary from optimal value @xmath167 to @xmath168 , the semimajor axis of the noise ellipse , i.e. the anti - squeezed quadrature , becomes rotated into the direction of the position . at the same time",
    "the ellipse becomes more stretched , i.e. the squeezed quadrature is more squeezed , while the anti - squeezed quadrature is more anti - squeezed . as @xmath147 vary from @xmath167 to @xmath169 , the semimajor axis of the noise ellipse also rotates into the direction of the position but the ellipse becomes rather bulged .",
    "furthermore , we show how the noise ellipse changes , as the measurement frequency is not chosen to be equal to the geometrical mean of the two classical noise frequencies , i.e. @xmath170 .",
    "for phase quadrature detection as in the lower panel of fig.[fig : sqhom ] , a slow measurement , i.e. with a low measurement frequency @xmath171 , generates a position anti - squeezed ( and momentum squeezed ) conditional state ; while a fast measurement with @xmath172 generates a position squeezed ( and momentum anti - squeezed ) conditional state .",
    "in addition , the deviation from the optimal measurement frequency , i.e. @xmath173 , always produces a less pure states .      up to now",
    "we have only treated in - going coherent vacuum states but one could also think about squeezed vacuum states coupling to the mirror  @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to inserting squeezed states into an interferometer s dark port . by doing",
    "so the quantum limited sensitivity of an interferometer can be enhanced  @xcite .",
    "the free - mass conditional state is given by @xmath174 here we have defined @xmath175 , where @xmath176 gives the optical squeezing strength in db at a squeezing angle of @xmath177 .",
    "then the purity of the conditional state can be inferred from @xmath178 the equality of the first inequality sign in eq .",
    "is achieved at @xmath179 for @xmath180 and at @xmath181 for @xmath182 , i.e. by squeezing either the phase or the amplitude quadrature , respectively .",
    "note that in eq . for any @xmath105 , the same minimum as in eq .",
    "is reached if @xmath183  even when having @xmath184 .",
    "therefore , even with input squeezing , the conditional state can not become more pure than with coherent input , but the demands on the required measurement frequency  and with this the constraints on the optical power , which is needed in order to obtain a certain uncertainty product , can be relaxed . in real experiments",
    "the optical power is of course always limited and squeezed input becomes an very important tool .",
    "it has turned out that the conditional variances are in principle even analytically equivalent in the following two cases : _ ( i ) _ input - squeezing at a flexible but frequency - independent angle or _",
    "( ii ) _ flexible amount of available optical power and a flexible but frequency - independent homodyne detection angle .",
    "this can easily be seen by replacing the homodyne detection angle @xmath185 and the measurement frequency @xmath186 in eqs.. then we simply end up with eqs.. here we can directly see that using input squeezing allows to change the parameters within @xmath105 such as the optical power , the laser frequency and the mirror mass but by modifying the input squeezing parameter @xmath187 we can at the same time maintain the measurement frequency .    even though a homodyne detection different from the phase quadrature and input squeezing do both not help with increasing the purity of the conditional state they increase the squeezing of the conditional test - mass state . furthermore , with a certain homodyne detection angle or with a certain input squeezing it is possible to minimize the position and momentum correlation in the conditional state .",
    "the concept of entangled states is one of the most important phenomenons when entering the quantum regime . in sec.[subsec : fincav ] we will see that the entanglement between the cavity mode and the mirror motion is in fact responsible for a degeneration of the purity of the mirror s quantum state . in this section",
    "we will explain how we can prepare quantum entanglement in position and momentum between the centers of mass of the two end mirrors in the north @xmath188 and the east @xmath189 arm of a simple , but power - recycled michelson interferometer using the conditional states as derived in the previous section .",
    "the end mirrors are suspended as pendulums but with a very low eigenfrequency .",
    "therefore , such an experiment would be in direct analogy to the einstein - podolsky - rosen gedanken experiment  @xcite . here",
    "we will basically extend the discussion carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "recall that the common @xmath190 and the differential @xmath191 mode of motion between the two end mirrors are independent and can each be sensed by a homodyne detection at the bright and the dark port , respectively , as suggested in ref .  @xcite . as already mentioned before ,",
    "if using the reduced mass of the mirrors , the conditional variances as derived in sec.[sec : marko ] hold for the differential mode observed at the dark port of the interferometer .",
    "but in order to describe the common mode they have to be slightly modified since the power - recycling cavity  here with high bandwidth and therefore an adiabatically eliminated cavity mode  with transmissivity @xmath192 enhances the measurement strength @xmath193 and is therefore different to the one associated with the differential mode @xmath194 .",
    "furthermore , the common mode will suffer additionally to the classical force noise and the classical sensing noise  note that we suppose that these two classical noise sources are equally distributed into common and differential mode  from laser noise , since the in - going modulation fields at the bright port are usually not in vacuum states .",
    "we have to make the following additional replacements in eqs.([eq : homcondvarxx])([eq : homcondvarxp ] ) in order to obtain the conditional variances of the common mode : @xmath195 and @xmath196 as well as replacing the detached @xmath197 in each variance by @xmath198 . here",
    "@xmath199 are the ( frequency independent ) spectra of the technical laser noise in amplitude and phase , respectively",
    ".    then we can assemble the conditional state of the entire system : the combined covariance among @xmath200 simply reads @xmath201 with @xmath202 this combined covariance matrix is very similar to the covariance matrix for the amplitude and the phase quadrature of two output light beams which have been created by overlapping two continuous gaussian light beams on a beam splitter . note that overlapping two light beams which are differently squeezed in amplitude and phase quadrature on a beam splitter is a very common way of how continuous variable entanglement is created in optics  @xcite . in the mirror case",
    "the common and the differential mode are mathematically overlapped to give the motion of each individual end mirror .    in the following",
    "we will use the _ logarithmic negativity _ , which was introduced for an arbitrary bipartite system in ref .",
    "@xcite , as a quantitative measure of the entanglement . for our state",
    "it reads @xmath203,\\ ] ] where we have @xmath204 and @xmath205 .",
    "the higher the value of @xmath206 the stronger the entanglement .",
    "recall that there exists a frequency band with sub - sql classical noise if @xmath207 .",
    "however , the existence of entanglement sets a slightly higher threshold value for this frequency ratio depending on the strength of laser noise as it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite . we know from sec.[sec :",
    "marko ] that the uncertainty product of each individual mode  common and differential  is minimal for a phase quadrature detection @xmath208 but it has turned out that this is not the optimal choice for the preparation of entanglement .",
    "if the homodyne detection angle approaches @xmath168 , each mode can become more squeezed depending on the measurement frequency .",
    "the entanglement between the two mirrors  created by overlapping two modes  increases with the squeezing of the individual modes and with the angle separating the squeezed quadrature of the two modes .",
    "then it is obvious that one should not observe common and differential mode via phase quadrature detection , but that there is a certain value , for each the common and the differential mode , of @xmath209 and @xmath210 which is optimal for the entanglement and maximizes the logarithmic negativity ( cf . the solid line in fig.[fig : lnmax ] ) .",
    "these optimal parameters depend of course on the classical noise , but are usually characterized by a high measurement frequency and a detection close to @xmath168 for both modes .",
    "that means that the states are totally driven by radiation pressure which is in turn monitored by reading out close to the amplitude quadrature .",
    "furthermore , we have found that the laser noise  entering at the bright port and in a totally balanced interferometer only affecting the common mode  can theoretically be almost suppressed with the optimally high measurement frequency and the optimal homodyne detection angle .",
    "therefore , the resulting maximal entanglement  represented by the solid line in fig.[fig : lnmax ]  is independent of the laser noise .",
    "but the parameters  such as optical power and the fine - tuning of the homodyne detection angle , which are required in order to reach the maximal entanglement , are different for different strength of laser noise and are far away from any realistic situation ( cf . the dots in fig.[fig : lnmax ] ) .",
    "in realistic experimental situations , the noise sources are usually not markovian . in this section",
    "we want to generally study quantum state preparation in the background of non - markovian noise sources .",
    "we start with allowing the quantum noise spectral density to become frequency dependent .",
    "if we consider a cavity of length @xmath211 with a finite half cavity bandwidth @xmath212 and a movable end mirror , the quantum noise is indeed non - markovian and the heisenberg equations of motion in frequency domain modify to @xmath213\\ , , \\label{eq : eomcy}\\\\ \\hat x & = & - \\frac{1}{m ( \\omega^2 + i\\gamma_m\\omega-\\omega_m^2 ) } \\left[\\frac{\\sqrt{2c\\gamma / l}}{\\gamma - { \\rm i } \\omega}\\alpha\\ , \\hat a_{1 } + \\hat \\xi_f\\right]\\ , , \\label{eq : eomcx}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have approximated exponential functions by rational functions of @xmath4 . now the measurement frequency becomes @xmath214 which corresponds to the frequency where the quantum noise spectral density of the associated adiabatically eliminated system touches the sql . if the phase quadrature of the outgoing light ( @xmath215 ) is detected , the eight zeros of its spectral density @xmath216 are given by @xmath217 and @xmath218 with ( for simplicity for a free mass , i.e. @xmath219 ) : @xmath220 where @xmath221 .",
    "the zeros are required for the spectral decomposition introduced in sec.[sec : wiener ] .",

    ", we obtain @xmath225 which reveals that , even in the quantum noise limited case , the conditional state of the test mass can not be pure as long as @xmath226 .",
    "this is in contrast to the markovian limit ( @xmath227 ) discussed in sec.[sec : marko ] , where the conditional state is always pure in the absence of classical noise [ cf .",
    "eq.([eq : hompurity ] ) ] .",
    "fig.[fig : fbq ] shows the purity of the test mass versus the dimensionless ratio @xmath224 .    in the case of a finite cavity bandwidth",
    ", the light is stored inside the cavity for some time .",
    "the information carried by the light concerning the test masss state can not leave the cavity instantaneously and hence is not accessible for the conditioning process .",
    "consequently , the intra - cavity mode needs to be taken into account for a complete characterization of the system .",
    "the residual second - order moments required for completing the corresponding @xmath228 conditional covariance matrix can be obtained in the same way as eqs.- .",
    "it turns out that the composite system is indeed a pure one even though each individual system resides in a mixed state .",
    "this is a clear evidence of entanglement between the conditional states of the test mass and the cavity mode .",
    "we have also plotted the logarithmic negativity in fig.[fig : fbq ] .",
    "the test - mass state s purity decreases and test - mass - light entanglement increases with smaller bandwidth and with higher measurement frequency @xmath229 .",
    "note that the uncertainty product as well as the logarithmic negativity do not diverge .",
    "but fig.[fig : fbq ] indicates that , as long as @xmath230 , we can neglect this effect and adiabatically eliminate the cavity mode as performed for the power - recycling cavity in sec.[sec : macroent ] .",
    "fig.[fig : fbqm ] further shows , that the purity increases with higher mechanical eigenfrequency @xmath94 , depending on the measurement frequency .",
    "let us consult the following hand - waving argument : with increasing @xmath94 the mechanical oscillator and the optical oscillator , which would resonate at modulation - frequency zero , become more separated in the frequency space and therefore their entanglement decreases . and with decreasing entanglement",
    "the test - mass state becomes more pure .     versus classical sensing noise and without force noise ( upper panel ) as well as versus classical force noise without classical sensing noise ( lower panel ) , both for different examples of ratios between measurement frequency and bandwidth .",
    "free mass limit is used , i.e. @xmath231 , as well as phase quadrature detection @xmath163 . ]    but the regime with such high mechanical resonance frequencies is usually not available in actual gw detectors .",
    "when including the two classical noise sources from our simple model the conditional state becomes more and more mixed with an increasing classical noise level as shown in fig.[fig : fbcl ] .",
    "note that this is of course not an effect of entanglement , the classical noise rather destroys the quantum entanglement between the test mass and the cavity mode .",
    "the purity also depends on the ratio between the measurement frequency and the optical bandwidth .",
    "recall that the classical force noise increases with higher @xmath140 while the classical sensing noise increases with lower @xmath141 . if we only take sensing noise into account we know for sure that the motion of the test mass is solely driven by quantum back - action noise .",
    "a high sensing noise level randomizes the measurement record and hence the delimitated accessibility of the intra - cavity field due to the finite bandwidth is insignificant .",
    "consequently all curves roughly coincide for @xmath232 in the upper panel of fig.[fig : fbcl ] .",
    "note that in the planned advanced ligo detector  @xcite , the measurement frequency @xmath229 is planned to roughly coincide with the half cavity bandwidth at @xmath233hz  corresponding to the solid lines in fig.[fig : fbcl ] .",
    "furthermore , we expect the suspension thermal noise to have a @xmath234hz  that would be less than @xmath235  but the coating thermal noise may provide a @xmath141 that only coincide with @xmath140 or is just marginally higher .",
    "we can infer form fig.[fig : fbcl ] that the quantum state of the interferometer s differential mode is mainly constrained by classical sensing noise which entails a lower bound of @xmath236 and gives an effective occupation number of @xmath237 . for a more detailed discussion see sec.[sec : advligo ] .",
    "a cavity which is detuned by @xmath238 from the carrier s frequency makes the power inside the cavity also dependent on the motion of the test - mass mirrors .",
    "this creates an _ optical spring _",
    "@xcite or an optical anti - spring both shifting the ( free ) mechanical and the ( free ) optical resonance frequency in the complex plane . in future gw detectors such as advanced ligo  @xcite , the optical spring effect will be used to up - shift the real part of the mechanical resonance frequency into the detection band .",
    "recall that the optical spring as well as the optical anti - spring usually introduces instability to the system which has to be cured with an appropriate linear feedback control  @xcite .",
    "but it is straightforward to show that the conditional covariance matrix does not change under any ideal , linear feedback control .",
    "the heisenberg equations of motion for such a system can be found in many previous works , see e.g. eqs.(39)(41 ) of ref.@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , analytic expressions for the conditional covariance matrix are cumbersome , and we only report numerical results . we also restrict ourselves to quantum noise , and reading out the phase quadrature , i.e. @xmath163 ( cf .",
    "eq.(3.2 ) of ref.@xcite ) . note that the measurement frequency @xmath229 is defined in the same way as for the tuned finite bandwidth configuration ( cf .",
    "eq . ) .",
    "fig.[fig : fbqd ] shows that detuning a cavity from the carrier frequency properly , can increase the purity which comes from the fact that the quantum entanglement between test mass and cavity mode is decreased . in the regime of a blue detuned cavity ( @xmath239 )  producing an optical spring  and for @xmath240 , fig.[fig : fbqd ] simply agrees with fig.[fig : fbqm ] . here at fixed measurement frequency @xmath241 a higher detuning @xmath238 gives a less shifted mechanical resonance , so - called _ optomechanical _ resonance , and at the same time it corresponds to a higher optical resonance .",
    "therefore , again the two oscillators are more separated in the frequency space and their entanglement decreases .",
    "interestingly , for higher @xmath229 the test - mass state could locally appear more pure in the red detuned cavity regime , i.e. at a certain @xmath242 , which produces an optical anti - spring . note that the uncertainty product diverges for an infinitely red detuned cavity ( @xmath243 ) . for these facts",
    "we unfortunately have not found any intuitive explanation .",
    "this will be a subject of further investigation .      in the following we consider a more realistic example configuration involving multiple colored classical noise sources .",
    "the classical noise contributions are highly non - markovian and they tend to rise fast in the low frequency regime , which is ignored by a simple markovian noise model .    first we restrict ourselves to an idealized noise budget of an advanced interferometric gravitational wave detector , shown in the lower panel of fig.[fig : cuttoff1 ] . here only the dominating force and sensing noise sources are considered .",
    "additionally we assume that the gravity gradient noise can be suppressed completely through monitoring the ground s motion .",
    "especially seismic noise dominates the entire spectrum below @xmath244 . in order to apply the numerical wiener filter procedure ( cf",
    "sec.[sec : wiener ] ) , all classical noise spectra need to be approximated by rational functions of @xmath70 .",
    "this is illustrated by fig.[fig : cuttoff1 ] ( upper panel ) where the seismic noise spectral density , pre - estimated by the simulation tool _ bench _",
    "@xcite , is approximated accordingly .",
    "the seismic noise spectrum is constant below @xmath245 , then it drops as @xmath246 between @xmath245 and @xmath247 and finally it drops as @xmath248 above @xmath249 .",
    "the suspension thermal noise constitutes a second force noise contribution which drops as @xmath250 above the pendulum eigenfrequency ( at @xmath251 ) and it intersects the sql at @xmath252 .",
    "such a frequency dependance presumes structural damping . above @xmath253",
    "the internal thermal noise follows @xmath254 and it intersects the sql at @xmath255 . we have employed the pad expansion in order to simulate the behavior of the spectral densities .",
    "it should be emphasized that the conditional second - order moments can diverge , if the sensing noise rises towards low frequencies , and therefore a cut - off frequency must be chosen carefully .",
    "this issue is illustrated by figs.[fig : cuttoff2 ] where the cut - off frequency of the sensing noise is varied , while the classical force noise contributions are held fixed .",
    "this divergence can be explained as follows : for a free mass , the effect of radiation pressure noise diverges towards low frequencies .",
    "hence the boundedness of the conditional variances depends crucially on the the motion of the test mass at low frequencies .",
    "furthermore the mirror thermal noise with @xmath256 formally leads to a logarithmic divergence . in the case of a real experimental set - up the mirrors",
    "are suspended as pendulums and the mirror thermal noise should also exhibit a low - frequency cut - off  but more importantly the low frequency noise will be canceled out in a subsequent verification stage , as it will be shown in a forthcoming paper  @xcite .",
    "such a cancelation arises from the fact that for the mirror thermal noise with frequencies lower than the inverse of the sum of the preparation - stage and verification - stage measurement time scales , their contribution to errors in the preparation and verification measurements are the same , and therefore cancels out , when the two sets of data are compared with each other .",
    "this argument justifies an increase of the cut - off frequency to a level of around 3hz .",
    "in this section we will investigate the performance of the planned advanced ligo detector  @xcite , a second generation gravitational - wave observatory , towards the preparation of test - mass quantum states .",
    "it is planned that this large - scale laser interferometer ( cf .",

    "our previous investigations in sec.[sec : marko ] and [ sec : nonmarko ] have suggested that such a sql - sensitivity allows to prepare nearly heisenberg - limited quantum states of macroscopic test masses .",

    "an additional optimization of the homodyne detection angle decreases this number only marginal .    aside from the currently estimated classical noise budget , a more optimistic scenario  @xcite has been investigated , in which the seismic and suspension thermal noise are reduced by a factor of ten , while the coating thermal noise is lowered by a factor of three ( in amplitude ) . here",

    "further major improvements regarding the classical noise level in the advanced ligo detector  especially the laser noise  will even allow to entangle the cavity mirrors in the north with those in the east arm .",

    "the uncertainty product of gaussian states is a true measure of the purity and therefore a reasonable measure of the quantum - ness of the state . trying to reconstruct , as commonly done , the number of quanta , the so - called _ occupation number _ , may not always be the most fundamental figure of merit : squeezed states , for example , can have high occupation numbers , yet they should be considered probably more quantum than vacuum states .",
