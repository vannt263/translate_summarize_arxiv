    "scalar electrodynamics ( i.e. , the u(1)@xmath0higgs theory ) in three dimensions describes several different physical systems .",
    "first , it is an effective high - temperature theory for 4d scalar electrodynamics ( with or without fermions )  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the 3d theory can be used to study the finite temperature phase transition in the 4d theory for small 4d coupling constants .",
    "second , it is directly the ginzburg - landau theory of superconductivity . in this case , as well , the properties of the phase transition between the normal and superconducting states are of much interest  @xcite .    in general",
    ", the properties of the phase transition in the 3d u(1)+higgs theory can not be reliably studied in perturbation theory .",
    "this is due to the fact that the 3d coupling constants are dimensionful , resulting in infrared problems if there are nearly massless excitations ( the true dimensionless expansion parameter is a coupling constant divided by a mass @xmath1 ) . while the ir - problems are not quite as severe as in non - abelian theories containing gauge self - interactions , they nevertheless exist .",
    "in addition , non - perturbative topological defects play a role in u(1)@xmath0higgs . due to the difficulties",
    "mentioned , the 3d u(1)@xmath0higgs theory should be studied non - perturbatively  @xcite .",
    "more specifically , some important problems to be addressed are : ( a ) the existence and order of a phase transition as a function of the scalar self - coupling , ( b ) the characteristics of the phase transition : the critical temperature @xmath2 , latent heat , surface tension , correlation lengths in the two phases , and ( c ) the convergence of perturbation theory in the broken phase .",
    "we present here preliminary lattice results on ( a ) ; more complete results on ( a ) and ( b ) will be presented elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "( c ) was addressed in  @xcite .",
    "the continuum u(1)@xmath0higgs theory in 3d is defined by the action @xmath3 , \\label{ac}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 .",
    "the scale of the theory is given by the dimensionful [ gev ] gauge coupling @xmath5 , and the other two parameters are dimensionless , @xmath6 the parameter @xmath7 is roughly proportional to the ratio of the squares of the scalar and vector masses deep in the broken phase , @xmath8 , while @xmath9 is related to temperature , @xmath10 . here",
    "@xmath2 is the tree level critical temperature .",
    "the ginzburg - landau theory of superconductivity is defined just by eq .",
    "( [ ac ] ) .",
    "conventionally , @xmath11 are denoted by @xmath12 in that context , and @xmath7 is represented by the ginzburg parameter @xmath13 . if @xmath14 the superconductor is of type i , if @xmath15 it is of type ii .",
    "the phase transition is of first order for strongly type i superconductors , and for strongly type ii superconductors it is usually assumed to be of second order .",
    "the action in eq .",
    "( [ ac ] ) can be discretized in the usual way .",
    "we use the compact formulation for the gauge field , so that the 3d lattice action is @xmath16 ^ 2 .",
    "\\label{laq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath17 is the compact link variable , @xmath18 is the product of link variables around a plaquette @xmath19 and @xmath20 is a complex scalar field located on sites . it would also be possible to use a non - compact formulation  @xcite .",
    "the three coupling constants in the lattice action are related to continuum parameters through a _ constant physics curve _ , which can be calculated using lattice perturbation theory . due to the fact that the couplings are dimensionful",
    ", the relation can be found exactly with a 2-loop calculation  @xcite .",
    "the relevant relations are @xmath21 @xmath22.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the continuum limit is hence at @xmath23 .",
    "note that increasing @xmath24 means decreasing @xmath9 .",
    "the simulations were done using cray c94 at the center for scientific computing in helsinki .",
    "for small @xmath7 , the phase transition in the 3d u(1)@xmath0higgs theory is of the first order  @xcite . for larger @xmath7 ( i.e. , for type ii superconductors ) , the ir - problems are more severe since the transition gets weaker , and the order has remained unclear .",
    "arguments in favour of a second order transition have been given , e.g. , in  @xcite , but a still higher - order transition can not at present be excluded . in particular , in the lattice studies in  @xcite ,",
    "the correlation lengths were not measured .",
    "it is interesting to compare the situation with that in the 3d su(2)@xmath0higgs theory .",
    "there the line of first - order transitions ends at @xmath25 , and for @xmath26 the transition is of higher than second order  @xcite .",
    "an important difference between the u(1 ) and su(2 ) cases is that in the latter all the excitations in the symmetric phase are massive , whereas in u(1 ) there should always be a massless photon in the continuum limit  @xcite .",
    "consequently , one can define an order parameter for the continuum theory  @xcite .",
    "away from the continuum limit an exponentially small non - perturbative mass is generated in the compact lattice formulation  @xcite , and the phases are analytically connected  @xcite .    to study the order of the phase transition , we have used two different values of @xmath7 .",
    "the first case @xmath27 corresponds to a strongly type i superconductor , and the other case @xmath28 to a strongly type ii superconductor .      in the analysis",
    "we follow closely  @xcite .",
    "the method employed is to plot the maximum of the susceptibility as a function of the lattice volume .",
    "the susceptibility @xmath29 is defined as @xmath30 in a first order transition @xmath29 grows as the volume @xmath31 and in a second order transition the expected behaviour is @xmath32 , @xmath33 being a critical exponent .",
    "if @xmath34 , or if the transition is of higher than second order , @xmath35 .",
    "our results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ scplot1 ] , and the individual susceptibilities in figs .",
    "[ scplot2]-[scplot3 ] .",
    "the system has a first order phase transition at @xmath27 , as the maximum of susceptibility grows linearly with volume .",
    "this is not the case with the @xmath28 data , so the transition in strongly type ii supercondutors is not of first order . the data would suggest that if the transition is of second order the critical exponent @xmath33 is close to zero , as noticed already in @xcite",
    ". however , the transition might also be of higher order .    to study the transition at @xmath28 in more detail",
    ", we have measured the masses of the scalar and vector excitations .",
    "the masses are measured from the exponential decay of suitably chosen correlators . for the scalar mass we used the operator @xmath36 and for the vector mass @xmath37",
    "the photon mass in the symmetric phase can be measured from the imaginary part of the plaquette variable at non - zero momenta  @xcite .    the scalar mass is shown in fig .  [ smass ] and the vector mass in fig .  [ vmass ] .",
    "the scalar mass is clearly non - vanishing . for the vector mass",
    "the signal gets very noisy in the symmetric phase ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) , and the techniques of  @xcite should be used . in general ,",
    "improved techniques make the masses smaller so that , for example , the vector mass could go to zero at the phase transition point .",
    "our very preliminary photon mass measurements in the symmetric phase are consistent with zero .        in conclusion",
    ", we have seen that in type ii superconductors the phase transition is not of first order .",
    "it may even not be of second order , since we see a non - vanishing scalar mass . for definite conclusions we will have to improve the quality of mass measurements and study the finite @xmath40 effects ."
