    "the mixing of neutral @xmath0 mesons provides a fertile area for precision tests of the standard model . the fact that the mixing is a second order weak process and is also suppressed by small ckm angles in the standard model makes it sensitive to new physics . in order to take full advantage of experimental measurements of the mixing",
    ", one needs to determine the hadronic matrix elements of the effective weak operators . for @xmath0 mixing the relevant operators are local four - quark operators with @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is @xmath2-quark number , and the relevant states are @xmath3 and @xmath4 mesons or @xmath5 and @xmath6 mesons .",
    "a first - principle evaluation of such operator matrix elements is possible with lattice qcd .",
    "lattice computations usually involve an extrapolation in light quark masses to the physical up and down masses , and always require an extrapolation in lattice spacing @xmath7 to @xmath8 , the continuum .",
    "these extrapolations can be controlled by using a version of chiral perturbation theory that includes the effects of the discretization errors associated with the choice of lattice action .",
    "in two recent lattice calculations of @xmath0 mixing @xcite , staggered light quarks are combined with non - staggered heavy quarks using nrqcd @xcite or the fermilab action @xcite , respectively . in such cases ,",
    "the appropriate chiral theory is `` rooted , heavy - meson staggered chiral perturbation theory '' ( ) @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "i calculate @xmath0 mixing to one - loop order in . roughly speaking",
    ", i work to leading order in the heavy - quark expansion , although i do include the large @xmath9 effects : the hyperfine splitting of @xmath0 and @xmath10 and the flavor splitting of @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "this is a systematic approximation in the power counting introduced by boyd and grinstein @xcite and discussed recently in ref .",
    "@xcite for the lattice calculation of heavy - light meson decay constants .",
    "if instead one prefers a power counting strictly in @xmath9 , which sets the splittings to zero , it is easy to take that limit of the results given in this paper .    in the  calculation , it is important to take into account the exact form of the lattice operator used to approximate the continuum one .",
    "references  @xcite construct the four - quark operators as the local product of two local bilinears , each formed from a heavy antiquark field and a light quark field with the `` naive '' lattice discretization . as proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and discussed below , the naive field is constructed in turn from the simulated staggered fields ( or more precisely , the naive propagator is constructed from the staggered propagator ) . both the use of naive fields and the local nature of the four - quark operator influence the form of the corrections at one loop .",
    "it is not hard to understand the qualitative effect of the lattice locality of the four - quark operator . because of lattice doubling symmetry",
    ", a ( single - component ) staggered quark field actually corresponds to the 16 continuum degrees of freedom of four `` tastes '' of four - component dirac particles . on the lattice ,",
    "the spin and taste degrees of freedom can be made explicit in position space by combining the 16 staggered components associated with an elementary hypercube @xcite . for our four - quark operators ,",
    "the two light staggered quarks are tied to the same space - time point , so that their spin and tastes are coupled .",
    "the coupling produces undesired contributions to the operator , with `` wrong spin '' and `` wrong taste . ''",
    "these undesired contributions appear at @xmath13 in the lattice spacing .",
    "fortunately , in the matrix elements considered here , continuum @xmath14 taste symmetry suppresses wrong - taste contributions and therefore wrong - spin contributions . on the lattice ,",
    "@xmath14 taste symmetry is violated at @xmath15 , so the undesired contributions come in at that order . since @xmath15 corrections appear at one loop in , that is the order at which we find wrong - spin , wrong - taste contributions to @xmath0 mixing .",
    "similarly , it is clear that the effect of using naive quarks in the operators and interpolating fields must be to sum over tastes , since the naive quarks have no explicit taste index .",
    "however , the details are non - trivial .",
    "it turns out that the heavy - light meson propagator is simply an average over the initial and final tastes , which are equal to each other .",
    "the three - point function involves a complicated sum over tastes of the staggered quarks in the interpolating fields and four - quark operator , and there is coupling between the spin matrices in the operator and the taste sum .",
    "these details play a key part in the discussion below .",
    "a calculation in  can be thought of as `` staggering '' the corresponding continuum calculation , which here would be in heavy - meson chiral perturbation theory .",
    "in fact , when the continuum calculation includes partial quenching effects , it is often possible to deduce the proper staggered version without having to recalculate explicitly any of the diagrams ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the current case",
    ", a partially quenched continuum calculation does exist @xcite .",

    "operators @xmath27 and @xmath28 appear in extensions of the standard model .",
    "additional operators with @xmath29 can also contribute beyond the standard model , but parity implies that their mixing matrix elements in qcd are equal to those of the above operators .",
    "in addition to parity , fierz transformations are needed in order to write the mixing matrix elements of any four - quark operator with these quantum numbers in terms of those in ; for a detailed explanation see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "i note that the corresponding projectors @xmath30 in ref .",
    "@xcite do not have the factor of @xmath31 , so the operators there are differently normalized .",
    "since in any case unknown low energy constants will enter in the chiral theory , this normalization difference is unimportant here .",
    "the fact that is a complete set of operators for @xmath0 mixing implies that wrong - spin contributions to the operators do not in fact lead to any new low energy constants in the chiral theory .",
    "wrong - spin contributions to operator @xmath32 merely lead to the appearance of the low energy constants associated with operators @xmath33 in the one - loop expression for the @xmath32 matrix element .",
    "thus , a staggered lattice calculation that computes the matrix elements of all the operators in will not suffer from increased systematic or statistical errors due to the wrong - spin issue .",
    "existing calculations @xcite study the matrix element @xmath22 exclusively . in the case of ref .",
    "@xcite , the one - loop contributions of wrong - spin operators were not known at the time , so one presumably should include some additional systematic error in their result . in the case of ref .",
    "@xcite , it was not possible to make a complete study of this effect because the matrix elements of the other operators were not computed .",
    "however , an associated systematic error was estimated .    in the relevant staggered simulations , the fourth - root of the fermion determinant",
    "is taken in order to eliminate the four - fold multiplicity of tastes in the sea . the rooted theory",
    "then suffers from nonlocal violations of unitarity at non - zero lattice spacing  @xcite . however , there are strong theoretical arguments  @xcite , as well as other analytical and numerical evidence  @xcite , that the local , unitary theory of qcd is recovered in the continuum limit . furthermore , it is straightforward to take rooting into account in the chiral theory .",
    "one simply needs to multiply each sea quark loop by a factor of @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "this can be done either by following the quark flow @xcite to locate the loops , or  more systematically  by replicating the sea quarks @xmath35 times and taking @xmath36 in the result of the chiral calculation @xcite .",
    "since i will need to work out the quark flows in any case , i use the former method below .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "briefly reviews the basics of , focusing in particular on those aspects that will be important here .",
    "in , i discuss the connection between naive and staggered quarks , and how it influences the structure of the four - quark operators and the interpolating heavy - light meson fields .",

    "the analytic terms in are of the form @xmath368 where @xmath369 and @xmath370 are continuum low - energy constants , and @xmath371 are lattice low - energy constants , summarizing the effects of taste - violating analytic chiral operators at nlo .",
    "as indicated , these constants depend on @xmath58 , on the operator whose matrix element is being calculated .",
    "it is straightforward to see that these are in fact the analytic terms that may appear by considering the effects of adding mass or taste - violating spurions to the chiral operators in .",
    "the parameters @xmath369 , @xmath370 , and @xmath371 , together with the parameters @xmath372 and @xmath373 in are to be determined from the fits to lattice data .",

    "my results are given by , with expressions for the various terms listed in and .",
    "the construction of the operators on the lattice as local products of local heavy - light bilinears , coupled with the use of staggered light quarks , results in the appearance of `` wrong spin / taste operators '' that are @xmath13 in the lattice spacing .",
    "their contributions to the matrix elements considered here are suppressed to nlo because violation of taste symmetry is required . at that order",
    ", they induce mixing of the operators , summarized in the quantities @xmath374 , , and @xmath375 , . however , as long as all five @xmath224 are analyzed simultaneously , there are no new low - energy constants induced by these effects : the constants @xmath376 and @xmath377 are all already present in the continuum .",
    "effective operator mixings may come from three additional sources , weak - coupling perturbative corrections , corrections to the position - space spin - taste construction , and corrections to the taste identification of the operators and interpolating fields .",
    "i argue that any nonanalytic terms that arise from such mixings are effectively nnlo , higher order than what has been considered here .",
    "because the light staggered quark is converted to a naive quark in the lattice representatives of the operators , the relationship between the staggered and naive quark fields plays an important role in my analysis .",
    "in particular , a naive quark is equivalent to four copies of staggered quarks , and the resulting `` copy symmetry '' can be used to simplify the calculations .",
    "an interesting resulting feature is that the taste structure of the operators is not the same for all diagrams , but depends on the quark flow .",

    "@xcite focused on the calculation of the quantity @xmath378 , which comes from the matrix element of operator @xmath22 .",
    "the chiral effects of the wrong spins were not known at the time of the hpqcd calculation @xcite and were therefore omitted from the analysis and error estimate . in the fermilab / milc calculation @xcite ,",
    "the complete  expressions were available , but the matrix elements of operators other than @xmath22 were not calculated , preventing a direct inclusion of the wrong - spin effects .",
    "however , it was possible to estimate the error of omitting these effects by using a small subset of new data to investigate the other matrix elements .",
    "the result , @xmath379 included a 3.2% error from this effect , which was the second largest source of error . in the ongoing second - generation fermilab / milc project @xcite ,",
    "matrix elements of all five operators @xmath224 are being computed , which means that the complete  expressions can be used in the analysis , and there will be no `` wrong - spin error . '' of course , a chiral / continuum extrapolation error will remain .    for future lattice computations of mixing with `` highly improved staggered quark '' ( hisq ) ensembles @xcite , taste violations are sufficiently reduced that the power counting used here , , may no longer be appropriate . depending on the range of lattice spacings",
    "studied and the statistical errors in the data , taste violations may in fact be so small that continuum heavy meson  might prove adequate for describing the data .",
    "more likely , one will want to use the  forms calculated here , but it may be necessary in addition to include the nlo chiral effects of the operators that enter through weak - coupling perturbative mixing , since such effects may no longer be much smaller than taste - violating nlo effects .",
    "including such effects in nlo  will however be straightforward , since the chiral logarithms for the complete set of operators , , have already been calculated above .",

    "<S> i calculate , at one loop in staggered chiral perturbation theory , the matrix elements of the complete set of five local operators that may contribute to @xmath0 mixing both in the standard model and in beyond - the - standard - model theories . </S>",
    "<S> lattice computations of these matrix elements by the fermilab lattice / milc collaborations ( and earlier by the hpqcd collaboration ) convert a light staggered quark into a naive quark , and construct the relevant 4-quark operators as local products of two local bilinears , each involving the naive light quark and the heavy quark . </S>",
    "<S> this particular representation of the operators turns out to be important in the chiral calculation , and it results in the presence of `` wrong - spin '' operators , whose contributions however vanish in the continuum limit . if the matrix elements of all five operators are computed on the lattice , then no additional low energy constants are required to describe wrong - spin chiral effects . </S>"
