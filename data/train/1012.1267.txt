    "as colloidal fluid particles move within the external , random field induced by a quenched , disordered arrangement of particles ( `` matrix '' ) , they can be either hindered in their motion by so - called cages formed by other fluid ( mobile ) particles , or trapped by the immobile particles of the matrix . in the former case , these cages eventually open due to the steady , collective motion of the fluid , while in the latter case",
    "whether or not a fluid particle can escape a certain region of space depends only on pre - set geometric and/or energetic restrictions .",
    "each of these processes alone as well as their interplay are responsible for slowing down the dynamics of the fluid , leading thereby to a complex dynamic behaviour of the system .",
    "these observations represent yet another confirmation that the properties of a fluid that is exposed to a random porous matrix differ substantially from those of a bulk fluid . while these phenomena have been extensively studied in experiment for a wide variety of systems ( e.g. , @xcite ) , related activities in theory and computer simulations considerably lag behind .",
    "this discrepancy is mainly due to two problems : ( i ) a realistic parametrisation of typical matrices studied in experiment is very difficult , and ( ii ) the evaluation of the physical properties of the fluid particles is conceptually difficult and numerically expensive . as a consequence , so far most , of the theoretical and simulation - based studies have focused on _ static _",
    "structural @xcite , and thermodynamic properties @xcite . only during the past few years",
    ", investigations on the _ dynamic _ properties of such systems have come within reach @xcite .",
    "recently , a major breakthrough has been achieved in the realm of theory : using concepts from the statistical description of so - called `` quenched - annealed '' ( qa ) mixtures ( see below ) , a framework has been put forward that allows to determine dynamic correlation functions of fluids confined in a porous matrix @xcite .",
    "the theory represents an extension to mode - coupling theory ( mct ) @xcite , a successful framework that can be used to obtain the _ dynamic _ correlation functions of a system solely from knowledge about its _ static _ structure functions .",
    "we shall henceforth refer to the theory as `` roz - mct '' , owing to the fact that it is based on mathematical methods used in deriving the replica ornstein - zernike ( roz ) equations @xcite , and that it can use structural information provided by the roz equations as a source of input .",
    "meanwhile , thanks to the considerably increased computational power of present - day computers , it is possible to systematically investigate the slow dynamic properties of fluids confined in a disordered environment in computer models . simulating such systems is costly for multiple reasons :",
    "( i ) long simulations are necessary to reveal the dynamic slowing - down of dense systems ( ii ) a large body of system parameter combinations needs to be considered ( iii ) many independent realisations of the same system have to be generated .",
    "the latter requirement arises from the prescription to evaluate the physical properties of qa systems , which involves an explicit double average procedure : the first average is the usual thermodynamic one to be taken over all possible configurations of fluid particles given a fixed matrix configuration , the second average is a disorder average to be performed over all possible matrix representations fulfilling pre - imposed criteria .    to date",
    ", the roz - mct framework has been applied only to qa models in which hard - sphere particles are confined in a hard - sphere matrix  either with fluid and matrix being of equal size @xcite or different sizes @xcite . within the qa model ,",
    "a matrix configuration is obtained by taking a snapshot of an equilibrated fluid ( quenched component ) ; subsequently the particles of the fluid ( annealed component ) are immersed in this configuration . shortly after publication of the theoretical predictions , extensive and systematic molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations",
    "have been performed for precisely this system @xcite . while simulations confirmed most of the intriguingly complex features that the theory predicted for the kinetic diagram ( such as a discontinuous and a continuous glass transition as well as a continuous diffusion - localisation transition ) , others are yet to be found ( in particular the re - entrant glass transition scenario ) . in this context",
    ", it is worth mentioning other recent works which investigate the dynamics of a fluid @xcite or of tracer particles @xcite moving in a matrix of quenched particles .",
    "our previous work @xcite was dedicated to an `` overall '' investigation of the dynamic properties ( in terms of both single - particle and collective dynamic properties ) of hard spheres confined in a disordered matrix of hard - sphere particles , and to a comparison of these results to the theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "computer simulations offer the distinct possibility to proceed one step further : in contrast to the theoretical framework , in simulations it is possible to distinguish between caging and trapping by geometrically analysing the voids formed by the matrix particles .",
    "the pertinent procedure reads as follows .",
    "given a particular realisation of a state point , the first step is to classify the voids formed by the matrix particles while disregarding the fluid particles .",
    "the algorithm used is detailed in ref .",
    "@xcite ; in short , we distinguish between _ disconnected _ voids of finite volume from which  due to geometric restrictions ",
    "particles can not escape , and the _ percolating _ void that  taking into account the periodic boundary conditions  extends over the entire space and in which particles can propagate infinitely far .",
    "( note that multiple percolating voids can only exist in systems of finite size . ) in the second step , for each fluid particle in the system realisation we use this void analysis to determine in which class of void the particle is located .",
    "the fluid particles thus fall in two classes : `` trapped '' particles ( superscript `` trap '' ) that populate the disconnected voids , and `` free '' particles ( superscript `` free '' ) that move in the percolating void .",
    "we then compute a set of single - particle dynamic correlation functions [ namely the self - intermediate scattering function @xmath2 , the mean squared displacement @xmath3 , and the self - part of the direction - averaged van hove function @xmath4 separately for the trapped and the free particles [ i.e. , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , etc . ] .    in an effort to specify and to quantify the respective contributions of trapped and free particles to the dynamic structure , @xmath2 and @xmath3",
    "are discussed along two specific pathways in the system s parameter space .",
    "the latter is spanned by the packing fraction of the fluid , @xmath7 , and that of the matrix , @xmath8 .",
    "the properties of @xmath9 for the trapped and the free particles are discussed for selected state points in the @xmath10 plane .    notwithstanding the presentation of _ quantitative _ results in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , it is worth clarifying what _ qualitative _ behaviour should be expected for the dynamic correlation functions . in the long - time limit , the contributions of the trapped and the free particles differ markedly , which bears physical significance . while the single - particle intermediate scattering function of the free particles will always relax completely for @xmath11 , this is never the case for @xmath5 . on the other hand",
    ", the mean - squared displacement of the free particles will always recover diffusive behaviour while @xmath12 will always saturate as @xmath13 , with the limiting value reflecting the average pore size . finally , for the free particles the self - part of the van hove function will rapidly relax towards zero for distances in the vicinity of zero .",
    "conversely , @xmath14 will _ not _ decay below a value significantly above zero . instead",
    ", it will approach a steady - state distribution that reflects the distribution in trap sizes and shapes .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in the subsequent section ( sec .",
    "[ sec : model.and.theoretical.approaches ] ) we briefly summarise the model and our simulation technique ( referencing previous publications for more details ) .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] is dedicated to the results : after a brief summary of our void identification algorithm as well as a short discussion of the void analysis of the state points treated in this contribution , we present in detail our results for the single - particle correlation functions . in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] we discuss implications of those results , and present explanations for the observations .",
    "the paper is closed with concluding remarks .",
    "following our previous work , we have used the qa protocol to describe the properties of fluid particles that are exposed to an external field of a random porous matrix . in this picture , the fluid particles move within the space left free by the matrix : both types of particles interact with each other , but the mobile fluid particles can not displace the matrix particles . choosing all particles to interact as hard spheres ,",
    "any state point is fully characterised by a combination of @xmath8 and @xmath7 .",
    "different , but equivalent matrix configurations of a given state point are obtained from an equilibrated hard - sphere fluid at a prescribed @xmath8 . for this , a pertinent simulation is halted at different times and the particle positions are subsequently used as positions of the matrix particles in a qa system . in all md simulations",
    "we have used an event - driven md algorithm adapted to keeping the matrix particles at fixed positions .",
    "periodic boundary conditions and the minimum image convention were employed .",
    "as prescribed by thermodynamics @xcite , observables are obtained from a double - averaging procedure : the first trace , taken over the degrees of freedom of the fluid particles for a particular matrix configuration , is realised using a time average along the simulation run ; the second one , taken over different yet equivalent matrix configurations , is realised as an ensemble average over independent simulation runs .",
    "all state points were studied via ensembles in which the number of fluid particles ( @xmath15 ) and the number of matrix particles ( @xmath16 ) added up to at least 1000 . for systems with elevated matrix packing fractions this number",
    "was considerably enhanced in an effort to guarantee that for all state points considered the ensemble contain at least 50 fluid particles .",
    "a method for finding an initial configuration of qa systems at large values of the total packing fraction , @xmath17 , has been presented and discussed in the appendix of ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the first phase of the simulation",
    "the system is equilibrated ; for clarifying comments on this delicate issue we refer the reader to section ii of ref .  @xcite . in case",
    "the system was successfully brought to equilibrium , we subsequently recorded the particle positions in a production run extending over the same simulation time as the equilibration run .",
    "we typically allowed for a maximum of @xmath18 for the equilibration run ; for selected systems this figure was increased to the tenfold value . here @xmath19 is the unit of time @xcite , where the particle mass @xmath20 , the temperature @xmath21 , and the particle diameter @xmath22 were chosen to be unity .",
    "the definitions of all observed quantities presented in this work [ @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath23 , and @xmath4 have been compiled in ref .",
    "@xcite , to which we refer the reader .",
    "due to the statistic nature of our matrix model , at any value of the matrix packing fraction @xmath8",
    "there is a nonvanishing probability for the immobile matrix particles to form traps  void spaces from which fluid particles enclosed therein are not able to escape due to geometric restrictions . at low values of @xmath8",
    "the number of traps is small , and most fluid particles can move infinitely far away from their initial location since the void in which they are located extends ( taking into account the periodic boundary conditions ) over the entire space . the latter volume , if present , is termed the `` percolating '' void . at sufficiently high @xmath8 ,",
    "on the other hand , all voids will be of finite size and represent traps from which the fluid particles can not escape .",
    "the transition between the two scenarios occurs at the so - called percolation transition .",
    "( for an overview over the large field of percolation transitions see , e.g. , @xcite ) . for an infinitely - large system",
    "this transition is sharp , i.e. , it occurs at some well - defined value @xmath24 of the matrix packing fraction .",
    "however , if the system is represented by a finite number of particles then this transition is smeared out ; for this reason in computer simulations matrix realisations featuring a percolating void are encountered also beyond @xmath24 .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "we have presented a computational study concerned with the dynamic properties of a model colloidal fluid adsorbed in a disordered , rigid array of obstacles .",
    "the original aspect of this study consists in the splitting of dynamic correlators into two contributions , one originating from the free and the other from the trapped fluid particles .",
    "the notion of `` free '' and `` trapped '' refers to the structure of the voids formed by the matrix : free particles are located in the infinitely - large percolating void whereas trapped particles reside in disconnected voids .",
    "we compared the relaxation patterns of the two components with the corresponding patterns for the full fluid , which allows to disentangle the dynamic effects due of crowding and confinement .",
    "further , our procedure provides some deeper insight into the relaxation processes at play at the microscopic level .",
    "our analysis confirmed the striking superposition of two relaxation mechanisms  trapping and caging  at a sufficiently large density of both the fluid and the matrix component , and supported the view that mct correctly captures the qualitative features of the dynamics in the corresponding portion of the kinetic diagram .",
    "our numerical procedure also unveils that an unexpected dynamic heterogeneity is present in the motion of fluid particles within the matrix structure : on the one hand , even particles residing in a percolating void may be effectively trapped ; on the other hand , residual relaxation can take place within disconnected pores .",
    "we believe these aspects to be relevant also for the assessment of dynamic heterogeneity in more general models of fluids adsorbed in porous media . whether these complex dynamic phenomena are present also in systems with different protocols to generate the matrix @xcite , soft interactions @xcite , or systems in which a large dynamic asymmetry replaces the quenched disorder @xcite is a question that remains to be addressed in future studies .",
    "we acknowledge fruitful discussions with v.  krakoviack and t.  franosch .",
