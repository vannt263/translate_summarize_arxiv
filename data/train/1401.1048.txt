    "information storage and processing using spins , referred to as spintronics @xcite , is an actively studied subject @xcite .",
    "the interest has been renewed by the prospect of using graphene for spintronics although the results are as yet controversial @xcite .",
    "spintronics exploits that spin - relaxation time , @xmath0 , exceeds the momentum - relaxation time , @xmath1 , by several orders of magnitude .",
    "@xmath0 gives the characteristic timescale on which a non - equilibrium spin - ensemble , either induced by electron spin resonance @xcite or by a spin - polarized current @xcite , decays to the equilibrium .",
    "it is thus the central parameter which characterizes the effectiveness of spin - transport and eventually the utility of spintronics .    in metals with inversion symmetry , the mechanism of spin - relaxation",
    "is described by the elliott - yafet ( ey ) theory @xcite . in the absence of spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) , there is no relaxation between the spin - up / down states .",

    "the admixture strength is given by the so - called spin - orbit admixture coefficient ( soac ) , which in the first order of the soc is : @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the matrix element @xcite of the soc for the conduction and the near lying band with an energy separation of @xmath9 .",
    "we note that for metals with inversion symmetry , the admixed spin - up / down states of the conduction band remain degenerate in the absence of magnetic field due to the time reversal symmetry ( or kramers theorem ) .",
    "elliott showed @xcite that the usual momentum - scattering induces spin transitions for the admixed states , i.e. a spin - relaxation , whose magnitude is :    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is a band structure dependent constant near unity .",
    "elliott further showed that the magnetic energy of the admixed states is different from that of the pure spin - states , i.e. there is a shift in the electron gyromagnetic factor , or @xmath12-factor :    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the free electron @xmath12-factor , @xmath15 is another band structure dependent constant near unity .",
    "result in the so - called elliott relation    @xmath16    which links three empirical measurables ; @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath17 . in practice ,",
    "the spin - relaxation time is obtained for metals from conduction electron spin resonance ( cesr ) measurements @xcite .",
    "this yields @xmath0 directly from the homogeneous esr line - width , @xmath18 through @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the electron gyromagnetic ratio .",
    "the cesr resonance line position yields the @xmath12-factor shift .",
    "although , the original theory of elliott @xcite involves the momentum - scattering time , @xmath1 , the transport momentum - scattering time , @xmath21 is more readily obtained from the specific resistivity , @xmath22 through : @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the vacuum permittivity , @xmath25 is the plasma frequency .",
    "the two momentum - scattering times differ in a constant at high temperature but have a characteristically different temperature dependence at low @xmath26 : @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( for scattering due to phonons ) .",
    "yafet showed that the low temperature spin - relaxation time also follows a @xmath29 law @xcite .",
    "this allows to summarize the elliott - yafet relation as :    @xmath30    monod and beuneu contributed to the field with two seminal papers @xcite : in ref .",
    "they tested the elliott - relation by collecting @xmath18 and @xmath17 data for elemental metals .",
    "they found that the elliott - relation is valid with @xmath31 for alkali metals ( except for li ) and for monovalent transition metals ( cu , ag , and au ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the validity of the elliott - relation has since been confirmed for alkali fullerides @xcite and intercalated graphite @xcite .",
    "deviations from the elliott - relation for polyvalent metals ( such as mg and al ) was explained by fabian and sarma by considering the unique details of the band structure where the soc is enhanced , which is known as the `` hot - spot '' model @xcite .    , the latter therefore dominates the soac . ]    in their second seminal paper ( ref . ) , monod and beuneu attempted to correlate the spin - relaxation data with estimated spin - orbit admixture constants .",
    "the energy splitting of a relevant atomic state due to soc was used as an estimate for the matrix element of the soc between the conduction and a near lying state .",
    "e.g. for na , definition of the relevant quantities is given in fig .",
    "[ levelscheme ] and the conduction band is the @xmath32 state ; the soac is either the @xmath33 or @xmath34 , whichever of the two ratios is the greater . for na , it is the @xmath34 ratio and the situation is depicted in fig .",
    "[ levelscheme ] .",
    "monod and beuneu found that the esr line - width data , when normalized by the larger of the two possible ratios squared , @xmath35 , falls on the _ same _ universal grneisen function for the alkali atoms ( na , k , rb , and cs ) and for the monovalent transition metals ( cu , ag and au ) as a function of the normalized temperature @xmath36 ( @xmath37 is the debye temperature ) .",
    "much as ref .   became a standard for our understanding of the spin - relaxation in elemental metals , it has some shortcomings and widespread misinterpretations in the literature which motivates the present revision .",
    "first , the transport momentum - relaxation time scales with the transport electron - phonon coupling , @xmath38 , and the debye temperature , @xmath39 , which was neglected in ref . .",
    "second , it is not immediately clear why the soc induced atomic _",
    "energy splittings _ should be identical to the spin - orbit _ matrix elements _ , even though one expects similar orders of magnitude .",
    "this uncertainty led to a confusion concerning what is meant by the soc strength ( e.g. refs .  ) . when investigated in detail",
    ", one finds that the agreement between the scaled esr line - width and the `` universal '' grneisen function is a result of the neglected @xmath39 and @xmath38 dependence .",
    "we note that the first hint that the atomic picture is not sufficient to explain the spin - relaxation properties came from the above mentioned works of fabian and sarma @xcite who showed that band - structure effects play an important role in aluminium and in other polyvalent metals .    herein , we show that in ref .",
    "the variation of the transport electron - phonon coupling constant and @xmath40 among the different metals was neglected , which however affects the value of @xmath21 .",
    "we show that the agreement between the scaled esr line - width and the `` universal '' grneisen function , which was found in ref .",
    "is a result of the neglected @xmath39 and @xmath38 dependencies .",
    "we present an analysis to provide the _ empirical _ spin - orbit admixture coefficients , which could serve as an input for future first principles based calculations .",
    "we also show that while the atomic spin - orbit splitting energies have the same order of magnitude as the matrix elements of the soc between adjacent bands but they are not identical .",
    "we provide a model calculation involving s and p states with spin - orbit coupling to explicitly show that the atomic soc induced energy splitting is not identical to the soc matrix element , the latter being sensitive to the s - p hybridization , i.e. for the details of the band - structure .",
    "in ref .  , monod and beuneu investigated the scaling of the normalized esr line - width with the transport momentum - relaxation time , @xmath21 , and found that the normalized esr line - width data falls on a universal grneisen function@xcite :    @xmath41 , \\end{aligned}\\label{grun_funcbm}\\ ] ]    where the constant was considered to be metal independent .",
    "the @xmath42 soac data were based on atomic spectra and were taken from ref .  .",
    "the grneisen function , @xmath43 , used by monod and beuneu was taken from ref .  .",
    "the original paper , ref .  , did not explicitly mention the normalization with @xmath40 .",
    "however since a single , `` universal '' grneisen function was argued to represent well the data @xcite , this presentation implies the @xmath44 factor .",
    "this , as we show below , makes the value of the soac uncertain .",
    "the role of the spin - orbit coupling admixture is discussed further below and here we first focus on the parameters of the transport momentum - scattering theory .    the contemporary description of the transport momentum - relaxation for alkali metals within the debye - model assuming zero residual scattering reads @xcite :    @xmath45    where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the boltzmann and planck constants , respectively and @xmath38 is the transport electron - phonon coupling constant . the two forms of the grneisen function , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , in eqs . and are equivalent .",

    "[ gr04 ] . , we show @xmath60 versus @xmath57 . the universal @xmath59 function from eq",
    ". is also shown . clearly , the normalized line - width data do not fall on the same curve when the variation of @xmath38 and @xmath39 among the four alkali metals is taken into account .",
    "this means that the atomic soc induced energy splitting per the energy difference between the adjacent states do not approximate well the real soac values .",
    "accidentally , the data for rb lies well on the plot indicating that then the proper soac value is well approximated by the atomic one .",
    "once the relevance of @xmath39 and @xmath38 is recognized , we use the experimental data to determine the experimental soac . in fig .",
    "[ lperd ] .",

    "we observe a non - negligible difference between the values used previously and those which are obtained considering the role of @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the present empirical values could be used as input for improved first principles calculations , which consider the band structure of these elements including spin - orbit coupling . naturally , such calculations were unavailable at the time of ref .",
    ", therefore our refinement of the values do not detract from the merit of the original work which highlighted the role of the atomic spin - orbit coupling .",
    "as mentioned above , monod and beuneu @xcite estimated the spin - orbit admixture coefficients , @xmath42 , using values based on atomic ones : for @xmath8 , the atomic soc induced energy splitting of a p orbital ( adjacent to an s orbital based conduction band ) and for @xmath9 the corresponding energy separation was used . while the energy separation between atomic orbitals is a good approximation for band - band separations ( given that usual band - widths are an order of magnitude smaller than energy separations in alkali metals ) , @xmath8 is a _ matrix element _ between neighboring s and p orbitals in the elliott theory and not the _ energy splitting _ for a p orbital .",
    "it is therefore not straightforward why the energy splitting should equal the matrix element of the soc between the s and p orbitals .",
    "the elliott - yafet theory involves the matrix elements of the soc hamiltonian , which reads for a radial symmetry of the interaction as @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the free electron mass .",
    "we denote the matrix elements of the soc by @xmath63 between the conduction band indexed by @xmath64 and an adjacent one with @xmath65 , and the corresponding energy separation between the bands with @xmath66 .",
    "the spin - relaxation is dominated by that neighboring band for which the @xmath67 ratio is larger .",
    "e.g. for alkali metals , the conduction band is based on the @xmath64 , @xmath68 orbital and the dominant spin - orbit state turns out to be the @xmath69 , @xmath70 state ( see fig .",
