    "quantum entanglement , which is so contradictory to our intuition , maybe the most fundamental feature of quantum mechanics . from the paper of einstein , podolsky , and rosen ( epr ) in 1935@xcite",
    ", quantum entanglement has been carefully investigated .",
    "it has found wide applications in the demonstration of quantum nonlocality and quantum information processing , such as quantum teleportation@xcite and quantum cryptography@xcite .",
    "greenberger , horne , and zeilinger have shown that quantum mechanical predictions for certain measurement results on three entangled particles are in conflict with local realism in cases where quantum theory makes definite predictions , whereas as for epr state with two entangled particles , the conflict with local realism only results from statistical predictions@xcite .",
    "actually , there are only two classes of inequivalent tripartite entanglements under local operation assisted by classical communication ( locc)@xcite : one is ghz state , expressed as @xmath2 the other is @xmath0 state , expressed as @xmath3 the experiments to observe photons ghz state and demonstrate quantum nonlocality by it have been accomplished@xcite . in these experiments ,",
    "the subsystem of the entanglement is single photon .",
    "recently , a new method to generate entanglement between atomic ensembles has been developed@xcite . in this paper",
    "we adopt this method to generate ghz and @xmath0 state and devise experimental schemes to demonstrate quantum nonlocality using the generated entanglement states .",
    "in contrast to the existing schemes , the one described here takes advantage of the virtues of entanglement between atomic ensembles , such as long lived time and more robust resilience to realistic imperfection ..",
    "the basic element of our scheme is an ensemble of many identical alkali atoms , which can be experimentally realized as either a room - temperature atomic gas@xcite or a sample of cold trapped atoms @xcite .",
    "the relevant level structure of the atom is shown in fig . 1 .",
    "a pair of metastable states @xmath4 and @xmath5 can correspond to  for example  hyperfine or zeeman sublevels of the atom .",
    "from the two levels @xmath4 and @xmath5 we can define a collective atomic operator @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the total atom number .",
    "the ensemble ground state can be expressed as @xmath8 @xmath9 .",
    "the raman pulse is so weak that the forward  scattered stokes light from the transition @xmath10 has a mean number much smaller than 1 .",
    "the forward  scattered stokes lights from the two ensembles are then interfered at a beam splitter and further detected by two single - photon detectors . in the cases where only one detector register a click",
    ", we can not distinguish from which ensemble this registered photon comes ; due to this indistinguishability , the projected state of the ensembles l and r is nearly maximally entangled , with the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 is an unknown phase difference fixed by the optical channel connecting the l and r ensembles , and @xmath13    we can generate ghz state by three pairs of such atomic ensembles .",
    "the whole state can be described by @xmath14|vac\\rangle ,   \\eqnum{4}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 denote the vacuum of the whole six ensembles . in the expansion of the state ( 4 ) , there are only two components which have one excitation in each pair .",
    "this component state is given by @xmath16 with @xmath17 , which is exactly the three - party ghz maximal entangled states in the ` polarization ' basis . in the system , by applying retrieval pulses of suitable polarization that are near - resonant with the atomic transition @xmath18 , we can simultaneously convert the stored atomic excitations into light , and by using single - bit rotations , such as hadamard transformations , and the number detection through single - photon detectors , we can generate the ghz state which is practical for experiment .",
    "the method described above is similar to the scheme proposed in ref.@xcite to entangle many atomic ensembles , but there are some differences in detail",
    ".    the efficiency of our scheme can be described by the total time needed to register the effective ghz state . through the similar analysis",
    "to duans@xcite , we can know the total time for registering the ghz state is @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the preparation time of state ( 3 ) , and @xmath21 describe the overall loss probability of photon detectors .",
    "now we can use the entanglement state generated above to test the quantum nonlocality .",
    "the scheme we present here is similar to the scheme in ref.@xcite in principle , but because we use a different entanglement source , which is a ` polarization ' maximal entangled ( pme ) @xcite state between atomic ensembles , we should adjust the measurement manners .",
    "the diagram of our set - up is shown in fig .",
    "2 .    analogous to polarization entanglement",
    ", we can write the generated photons ghz state as    @xmath22    where @xmath23 @xmath9 denotes that a photon is emitted from the atomic ensemble @xmath24 , and @xmath25 denotes that a photon is emitted from the atomic ensemble @xmath26 , here we assume the notation 3 + 1@xmath271 for the subscripts .",
    "it is obvious that the three photons are in a quantum superposition of the state @xmath28 ( all three photons are emitted from the atomic ensembles marked by @xmath29)@xmath30 and the state @xmath31 ( all three photons are emitted from the atomic ensembles marked by @xmath32 ) , so none of the three photons has a well defined state of its own",
    ".    we can also consider measurements of other bases which can be expressed as @xmath33 for convenience we will refer to a measurement of @xmath34 as a @xmath35 measurement , and one of @xmath36 as a @xmath37 measurement .    it has been shown that the demonstration of the conflict between quantum mechanics and local realism consists of four experiments , each with three spatially separated ` polarization ' measurements@xcite .",
    "first , we perform @xmath38 @xmath39 and @xmath40 experiments .",
    "if we obtained the results predicted for the ghz state , then for a @xmath41 experiment , our consequent expectations according to local - realism are exactly the opposite of the expectations according to quantum mechanics@xcite . in our set - up shown by fig .",
    "2 , when none phase plate is installed we implement a @xmath35 measurement , and when a @xmath42 phase plate is installed , we implement a @xmath37 measurement . by observing",
    "which detector register a photon , we can know the result of a measurement .",
    "so we can test the quantum nonlocality in the same steps as in ref.@xcite .",
    "in the following we propose a similar method to generate @xmath0 state , which is also based on the preparation of the state ( 3 ) . the method is divided into three steps as follows :    first , we prepare three pairs of atomic ensembles in the state ( 3 ) @xmath43|vac\\rangle \\text { } ( i=1,2,3 ) .   \\eqnum{8}\\ ] ]    second , we prepare non - pme @xmath0 state between three atomic ensembles denoted by @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 . the set - up",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "all the atoms of the three ensembles are initially prepared in the ground state @xmath4 .",
    "the three ensembles are put in a line , and illuminated by a short , off - resonant laser pulse that induces raman transition into the state @xmath5 . behind the third ensemble , we put a filter which can eliminate the pump laser pulse from the forward - scattered stokes photon , and a single - photon detector to detect the stokes photon . the set - up",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "because in the free space the velocity of the stokes light is close to @xmath47 , so the delay between the stokes photons emitted from different ensembles is much smaller than the pulse width .",
    "therefore when we register only one click in the detector , we can not distinguish which ensemble this registered photon comes from , so we obtain the state @xmath48 where @xmath15 denote the vacuum state of the three ensembles . we should notice that @xmath49 is entangled in fock basis which is experimentally hard to do certain single - bit operations .",
    "the whole state of the nine ensembles can be described by    @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "this component state is given by @xmath52    using the set - up in fig .",
    "4 , we apply retrieval pulses to ensembles @xmath53 and @xmath51 @xmath54 and register only the coincidence of the three party , i.e. there is one and only one click on each party , through the postselection techniques an experimentally practical @xmath0 state can be obtained .",
    "if the state @xmath55 ( @xmath56 and @xmath49 can be prepared independently at the same time , the total preparation time of state @xmath57 is @xmath58 @xmath59 where @xmath20 is the preparation time of @xmath60 and @xmath61 is the preparation time of state @xmath62 in fact , we can easily know that when atomic ensembles are illuminated by pumping light , the excitation probability of state @xmath55 and state @xmath49 are at the same order , as well as @xmath20 and @xmath61 .",
    "now let we see how to demonstrate quantum nonlocality by @xmath0 state . here",
    "we use the same notations as in ref.@xcite : @xmath63 and @xmath64 will be the results ( @xmath65 or @xmath66 ) of @xmath67 and @xmath35 measurements on the party @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) . by applying retrieval pulses ,",
    "if a stokes photon was detected by the detector @xmath70 , we assume @xmath71 and if it is detected by the detector @xmath72 @xmath54 , we assume @xmath73 . we can implement a @xmath74 measurement on party @xmath68 by applying a retrieval pulse to the ensemble @xmath75 , and if a stokes photon is detected , i.e. the ensemble has an excitation , we assume @xmath76 if not we assume @xmath77    according to the rules described above , we can easily check the following three properties experimentally .",
    "@xmath78    where @xmath79 @xmath80 means the probability of two parties ( although we can not tell which two ) giving the result @xmath65 when implementing @xmath81 measurements on all three parties , and @xmath82 @xmath83 is the conditional probability of two @xmath35 measurements on parties @xmath68 and",
    "@xmath84 having the same results given that the result of a @xmath67 measurement on party @xmath85 is @xmath65 @xmath86    based on epr s local realism , we can deduced from the properties ( 12 ) that @xmath87 , but according to quantum mechanics @xmath88 where @xmath89 means the probability of three separated @xmath35 measurements giving the same results .",
    "so we can demonstrate quantum nonlocality with @xmath0 state .",
    "we can also consider mermin s inequality with tripartite entanglement@xcite @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are observables of qubit @xmath68 . by choosing @xmath93 and @xmath94",
    ", we can observe the violation of the inequality by experiments .",
    "in summary we have proposed an experimental scheme to generate ghz and @xmath0 state between macroscopic atomic ensembles , and demonstrate quantum nonlocality by the generated entanglement state . with the current technology",
    ", we can realize the scheme which benefits much from the important property of built - in entanglement purification , furthermore , all we use in the scheme are linear optical elements , which make it easy to manipulate@xcite .",
    "in addition , our scheme can be easily generalized to entangle more than three atomic ensembles or only two ensembles .",
