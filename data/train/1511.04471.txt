    "one motivation for research into partial hyperbolicity is the study of invariant objects in dynamical systems which persist under perturbation . to this end , we start the survey by defining isolated sets and investigating their properties under changes to the dynamics .      consider a diffeomorphism @xmath0 on a riemannian manifold .",

    "* chapter 9 ) and references therein .      finally , we mention stable ergodicity as a major motivation for studying partially hyperbolic dynamics .",

    "( for reasons lost to history , the term `` stably ergodic '' has won out over `` robustly ergodic . '' )    in the 1960s , d.  v.  anosov demonstrated that volume - preserving anosov diffeomorphisms are stably ergodic @xcite .",
    "this is a large part of the reason that they are called `` anosov '' diffeomorphisms . for decades ,",
    "anosov systems were the only known examples of stable ergodicity , though some systems were known to be stably ergodic among certain interesting classes of perturbations .",
    "a notable case is that of frame flows in negative curvature which represent a class of genuinely partially hyperbolic flows , which under certain conditions can be shown to be stably ergodic among frame flows @xcite .    in 1995 ,",
    "grayson , pugh , and shub gave an example of a partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism which is stably ergodic @xcite.this lead to a frenzy of research in the subsequent years showing that many volume - preserving partially hyperbolic systems are stably ergodic .",
    "see @xcite for surveys of the results relating partial hyperbolicity and stable ergodicity .",
    "see also @xcite which directly apply classification and leaf conjugacy results to the study of ergodicity .",
    "many surveys on partial hyperbolicity already exist @xcite . particularly , a recent survey treats partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms in dimension 3 including a considerable section devoted to classification and integrability @xcite .",
    "it is therefore a big challenge to write a survey which complements these existing materials .",
    "we felt that there were still interesting things to be said , in particular regarding the classification problem . in this paper , many relevant aspects are omitted or only briefly discussed if they are covered in detail in other surveys .",
    "for instance , it is standard when surveying a mathematical subject to start with a list of known examples . instead , we refer the reader to the above surveys and to ( * ? ? ? * section 3 )",
    ".    a geometric structure such as a splitting of the tangent bundle into subbundles will likely impose some form of restriction both on the manifold and on the isotopy class of a diffeomorphism which leaves it invariant . for anosov diffeomorphisms in dimensions 4 or higher , however , the classification problem is yet completely open . for anosov flows ,",
    "the same problem arises . even in dimension 3 , where many results are known",
    ", there are still many open questions . for example , infinitely many hyperbolic 3-manifolds are known to support anosov flows @xcite and infinitely many do not @xcite , but there is still an infinite class of hyperbolic manifolds where the question is wide open .",
    "classifying partially hyperbolic systems is , in principle , much more complicated and includes the classification of anosov diffeomorphisms and flows as subproblems .",
    "indeed , the understanding of which manifolds and isotopy classes admit partially hyperbolic systems is much less advanced than for anosov systems .",
    "the bulk of this survey concerns the classification of partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms in closed 3-dimensional manifolds .",
    "higher dimensions are discussed only briefly at the end .",
    "the main point , suggested informally by pujals in a conference and later formalized by bonatti and wilkinson @xcite is that even if classification of anosov systems may be out of reach , it is reasonable to attempt to _ compare _ partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms to anosov systems .",
    "many conjectures and perspectives were triggered by this approach and we refer to the recent survey @xcite .    here",
    "we present a series of recent results and examples related to this approach .",
    "of course , the choice of results is biased by the interests of the authors with a special emphasis on presenting both our previous and ongoing joint work .",
    "there have been essentially two approaches to the classification problem .",
    "the first , initiated in @xcite , looked at the behavior of the center foliation in known examples and showed that this behavior characterized the examples .",
    "this has been quite successful and it has even lead to progress in higher dimensions @xcite and it is partially surveyed in [ sec : others ] .",
    "a different approach , initiated by the work of brin , burago and ivanov @xcite , instead makes assumptions on the underlying topology of the manifold and , in cases , also on the isotopy class of the diffeomorphism .    in the rest of this section ,",
    "we restrict to the 3-dimensional case .",
    "the study of 3-manifolds is quite advanced , and it makes sense to separate the study of partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms based on the geometry of the manifold .",
    "first , we consider `` small '' manifolds where the volume of a ball in the universal cover is polynomial in the radius of the ball .",
    "equivalently , the fundamental group has polynomial growth ( see @xcite ) . in this",
    "setting , unstable curves grow exponentially fast under the dynamics and in some sense wrap around themselves in the compact manifold .",
    "this idea of curves in manifold `` wrapping around themselves '' under iteration may be made rigorous by considering the action in homology .",
    "this was formalized and proved in @xcite and extended in @xcite to show the following :    [ thm : phpoly ] let @xmath9 be a partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism supported on a 3-manifold @xmath57 such that the fundamental group has polynomial growth .",
    "then , ( up to finite cover ) @xmath57 is a circle bundle over a torus , and the action @xmath80 on homology @xmath81 has eigenvalues @xmath82 with @xmath83 .",
    "give an outline of results featuring in the proof of [ thm : phpoly ] .",
    "circle bundles over the torus may also be viewed as quotients of nilpotent lie groups by a discrete lattice .",
    "that is , they are nilmanifolds .",
    "further , for every nilmanifold in dimension three there is an automorphism of the nilpotent lie group which quotients down to a partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism on the nilmanifold ( * ? ? ?",

    "we next consider the case where the fundamental group has exponential growth .",
    "this comprises a much larger class of 3-manifolds .",

    "finally , [ thm : sol ] is reviewed in [ sec : sol ] .",
    "after manifolds with solvable fundamental group , the next family of manifolds in terms of complexity are seifert ( fiber ) spaces .",
    "these generalize circle bundles over surfaces .",
    "ghys showed that , up to finite cover , any anosov flow on a circle bundle is orbit equivalent to a geodesic flow @xcite .",

    "the dehn twist is constructed so that it is supported on a set of the form @xmath636 for very large @xmath628 so that the effect of the modification can be made to be almost negligible at the level of the derivative , this allows the twist to satisfy conditions .",
    "the details can be found in @xcite but let us say a few more words on how this is done :    * parametrize @xmath637 by a diffeomorphism @xmath638 \\to \\mathcal{u}_n$ ] defined by @xmath639 since the center - stable foliation is invariant under the flow , preimages of its leaves under @xmath640 are sets of the form @xmath641 $ ] where @xmath189 is a curve in @xmath333 .",
    "therefore , the center - stable foliation on @xmath57 defines a one - dimensional foliation @xmath642 on @xmath333 .",
    "similarly , a transverse foliation @xmath643 exists for the center - unstable direction . *",
    "if the example is done carefully , it is possible to construct a path of diffeomorphisms @xmath644}$ ] of @xmath333 which is not homotopically trivial and such that @xmath645 is transverse to @xmath643 and @xmath646 is transverse to @xmath642 for all @xmath647 .",
    "one requires the path to start and end in the identity and such that for every @xmath648 one has that the curve @xmath649 is homotopically non - trivial .",
    "* by choosing a very large @xmath628 , one has that the strong bundles are very close to being tangent to the tangent spaces of the one dimensional foliations @xmath650,@xmath651 in the @xmath652 $ ] coordinates .",
    "therefore , in these coordinates , one can construct a dehn twist @xmath653 which , when sent back to @xmath637 via @xmath640 will verify the conditions .    by general 3-manifold topology reasons",
    ", one can show as desired that this dehn twist will not be homotopic to the identity . in @xcite",
    "a specific example is treated where one can show this via elementary methods ( showing that the action in homology is non - trivial ) .",
    "recently , in @xcite it is shown that this construction can be made to any non - transitive anosov flow .",
    "the construction in the previous subsection relied on the fact that @xmath654 is disjoint from @xmath333 for all @xmath655 .",
    "this allowed us to spread out the perturbation and obtain the transversality conditions .",
    "if one wishes to make a transitive example starting from a transitive anosov flow , this condition will never be satisfied .",
    "one of the main constructions in @xcite consists in making a quantitative version of the previous argument , applied to certain transitive anosov flows transverse to tori ( see @xcite for plenty of such examples ) that after huge finite lifts will be treated in a similar way as the non - transitive case .",
    "this implies solving several technical difficulties , but at the end it is possible to do so without so many differences as in the previous case .",
    "to guarantee that after perturbation the new diffeomorphism is transitive , one could argue directly with some attention to be able to use the transitivity of the anosov flow and the control on the perturbation , but there is a way to do this with an easy trick that moreover allows us to obtain even better results ( construct stably ergodic examples ) .",
    "the key point is that if the anosov flow is volume preserving and the dehn twist with which we compose preserves the same volume form , the new example will be also conservative , and therefore easier to show it can be perturbed to be robustly transitive ( and stably ergodic ) . to do this , in ( * ? ?",
    "* section 3 ) the example is constructed starting with the anosov flow constructed in @xcite and as explained before , considering a big finite cover .      in @xcite",
    "there are examples of different nature also , constructed via dehn twists along tori , but which are not transverse to the anosov flow .",
    "the transversality conditions can be guaranteed by `` geometric '' reasons .",
    "we will explain these examples in the following subsection .",
    "let @xmath657 be any smooth diffeomorphism .",
    "the projectivization @xmath658 defined as @xmath659 conjugates the geodesic flow of the metric @xmath14 with the one obtained by the pullback @xmath660 .",
    "that is , if @xmath661 denotes the geodesic flow of @xmath660 one has that :        [ prop - closemetric ] it is possible to construct @xmath657 not isotopic to the identity in @xmath210 so that @xmath664 and @xmath14 are very close to each other ( in the @xmath665-topology ) and with @xmath14 having constant negative curvature .",
    "this is done in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2 ) via considering a hyperbolic metric of constant curvature @xmath666 with a very short closed geodesic and choosing @xmath9 to be a dehn twist along this curve , since the geodesic is short , it follows that , in the universal cover , the lift of the diffeomorphism @xmath9 is very close to the identity .",
    "it follows that the diffeomorphism @xmath667 for large @xmath628 will be partially hyperbolic thanks to proposition [ prop - mecanism ] and not isotopic to the identity because @xmath663 is not .",
    "since @xmath663 does not preserve the length along fibers , it will not preserve the volume form on @xmath668 .",
    "however , it is possible to find a diffeomorphism @xmath32-close to @xmath663 which does preserve this volume form and for which [ prop - mecanism ] still applies .    in principle",
    ", this idea and the examples presented in the previous section suggest that one might be able only to make examples isotopic to dehn twists .",
    "these have the particularity that their action in homology only has eigenvalues of modulus @xmath282 .",
    "the proof of proposition [ prop - closemetric ] as explained above , requires a small geodesic along which one performs a dehn twist . if one would like to construct @xmath9 which belongs to a mapping class having eigenvalues larger than @xmath282 , then one would need to compose with crossing dehn twists , but if one curve is short , the transverse one should be long .    in @xcite this problem is solved by considering maps and geodesic flows in non - connected surfaces and choosing the initial diffeomorphisms not to be the geodesic flows , but to permute the connected components and apply the geodesic flow so that the diffeomorphism visits every connected component . in this way , it is possible to modify the metrics little by little in order to apply dehn twists in different connected components so that a sufficiently large iterate will observe the multiple dehn twists and the return map to a connected component will be partially hyperbolic . in particular , it is shown :    [ teo - unittangentbundle ] given a surface @xmath210 of genus @xmath669 and a diffeomorphism @xmath657 , there exists a ( stably ergodic ) partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism @xmath670 isotopic to @xmath663 .      the mechanism for constructing new examples needs to start with a partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism on @xmath57 .",
    "in particular , this can only give examples on new isotopy classes , but not on different manifolds .",
    "in this direction recall [ thm : transflow ] stating that if @xmath9 is transitive and every center - leaf is fixed by @xmath9 and there is a circle leaf then this must be essentially the case ( see the discussion after the statement of [ thm : transflow ] ) . see @xcite for more questions arising naturally from these new examples .",
