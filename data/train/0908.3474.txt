    "besides an experimental confirmation of a core collapse event through the detection of supernova neutrinos @xcite , the second most important insight provided by observations of supernova 1987a was the occurrence of large - scale non - radial flow and extensive mixing of chemical species in the envelope of the progenitor star during the explosion ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "while sn1987a still remains the most prominent and thoroughly - observed example , observations of many other core - collapse supernovae ( sne ) have meanwhile provided ample evidence that large - scale extensive mixing seems to occur generically in such events ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , the modeling of the light curve of sn1987a using 1d radiation hydrodynamic calculations requires a large amount of mixing of ni outward to the h - he interface and of h inward into the he - core @xcite .",
    "moreover , the asymmetry of iron and nickel lines in sn1987 can be explained , if ni is concentrated into many high - velocity bullets @xcite . on the other hand , the bochum event ,",
    "i.e. , the sudden development of fine - structure in the @xmath7 line about two weeks after the explosion @xcite , implies that a high velocity ( @xmath8km / s ) clump of @xmath9ni with a mass of @xmath10 was ejected into the far hemisphere of sn1987 @xcite .",
    "observations of near - infrared hei lines from typeii sne between 50 and 100 days after core collapse imply mixing of @xmath9ni into the hydrogen envelope @xcite .",
    "these authors further conclude that those lines are formed in a clumpy environment .",
    "dense knots , indications of ejecta shrapnels , and filaments seen in supernova remnants by hst in the visible @xcite and by rosat , chandra , and xmm in x - rays @xcite also provide strong evidence that mixing and perhaps even fragmentation is a common process in supernova explosions .",
    "spectropolarimetric observations of typeii - p and typeiin sne at late epochs , when the hydrogen envelope starts thinning , reveal strong evidence for a globally highly aspherical distribution of the inner ejecta @xcite .",
    "similar results are obtained from spectropolarimetric observations of typeib / c sne @xcite .",
    "finally , studying the nebula spectra of snic 2002ap by the means of synthetic spectra , @xcite found evidence for an oxygen - rich inner core and @xmath9ni at high velocities , suggesting a highly aspherical explosion especially in the inner parts .",
    "two - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of non - radial flow and mixing in the stellar envelopes of core collapse supernova progenitors have been performed by several groups .",
    "the first simulations were started by artificially seeding rayleigh - taylor instabilities ( rtis ) in the mantle and envelope of the progenitor and following their evolution until shock breakout from the stellar surface @xcite .",
    "more recent simulations consistently connect the seed asymmetries arising from convective flow in the neutrino - heated bubble , and by the standing accretion shock instability ( sasi ) in the `` supernova engine '' during the first second of the explosion ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to the later rayleigh - taylor and richtmyer - meshkov instabilities after shock passage through the outer stellar layers with application to sn1987a @xcite .",
    "rayleigh - taylor induced mixing and the amount of fallback occurring during artificially triggered ( piston model ) , and initially spherically symmetric supernova explosions of zero- and solar - metallicity 15 and @xmath11 stars were studied by @xcite . in all models considered by them the velocities of the heavy elements were less than those observed in sn1987a .",
    "@xcite explored the observational characteristics of jet - driven supernovae in a red supergiant progenitor injecting @xmath5ergs of kinetic energy and varying the characteristics of the assumed bipolar outflows ( jets ) .",
    "their simulations show the development of fluid instabilities that produce helium clumps in the hydrogen envelope , and nickel - rich jets that may account for the non - spherical excitation and substructure of spectral lines",
    ".    only a few attempts to 3d simulations have been made up to now .",
    "@xcite simulated the adiabatic point explosion of an @xmath12 polytrope using a 3d smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code , and claimed to have found pronounced rayleigh - taylor instabilities in that event .",
    "however , this claim was neither confirmed by the 3d simulations of @xcite using a 3d hydrodynamics code based on a high - resolution shock - capturing finite - volume method , nor by @xcite who also used a 3d sph code . both studies found only a weak instability , i.e.",
    ", no extensive clumping and mixing , consistent with linear stability analysis .",
    "subsequently , 3d simulations by @xcite and @xcite using relatively coarse resolution and/or considering only a wedge - shaped fraction of the star showed that seed perturbations grow strongly at the he - h interface when a realistic presupernova star model is used instead of an @xmath13 polytrope .",
    "later @xcite studied the difference in the growth of 2d versus 3d single - mode perturbations at the he - h and o - he interfaces of sn1987a .",
    "they found that the 3d single - mode perturbation grows about 30% faster than a corresponding 2d one .",
    "although the difference between 2d and 3d predicted by their simulations is not enough to account for the difference between observed @xmath9ni velocities in sn 1987a and the results of previous 2d simulations of sn 1987a , their results suggest that non - radial flow and mixing in supernova envelopes in full 3d is noticeably different from that predicted by 2d simulations .",
    "this finding is also supported by laser experiments and comprehensive rayleigh - taylor growth simulations @xcite .",
    "the only other 3d simulations we are aware of are those published by @xcite in two short conference proceedings .",
    "these authors simulated the propagation of a 1d shock wave resulting from an artificially triggered spherical explosion of @xmath5ergs until it reaches the he - h interface of a sn1987a progenitor model computed by @xcite .",
    "then they perturbed the flow inside the shock radius and followed the growth of sinusoidal velocity perturbations with a 3d adaptive mesh hydro - code on a grid with an effective resolution of up to @xmath14 zones .",
    "for an initial perturbation amplitude of 10% , fingers of heavy elements penetrate into the hydrogen envelope with large velocities .    here",
    "we simulate for the first time , starting with 3d models for the beginning of neutrino - powered explosions from @xcite , the evolution of a supernova blast in 3d from the first hundreds of milliseconds to a time three hours later when the shock has broken out of a blue progenitor star .",
    "we find that not only the growth of rayleigh - taylor instabilities is different in 3d as concluded from other works ( see above ) , but also that the propagation of `` clumps '' in 3d is different from the 2d case .",
    "in particular the latter effect is of large quantitative importance , because we demonstrate here that it determines the long - time evolution and in the end the extent of large - scale radial mixing in core - collapse supernovae .",
    "quantitatively meaningful simulations of observable explosion asymmetries therefore require modeling in three spatial dimensions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .  2 we describe the computational setup and the initial model used in our simulations .",
    "our results are discussed in sect .  3 where we particularly address the dynamical evolution and the radial mixing of chemical elements .",
    "in sect .",
    "4 we present a simple analytical model that explains the differences found for the clump propagation between 2d and 3d quite well .",
    "finally , we summarize our findings in sect .  5 , and draw some conclusions .",
    "for our simulations we used the explicit finite - volume eulerian multi - fluid hydrodynamics code , prometheus , developed by bruce fryxell and ewald mller @xcite .",
    "the code integrates the equations of multidimensional hydrodynamics to second order accuracy in space and time using the dimensional splitting approach of @xcite , the ppm reconstruction scheme @xcite , and a riemann solver for real gases according to @xcite .",
    "multi - fluid flows ( involving the advection of , e.g. , several nuclear species ; see below ) are treated by means of a set of additional continuity equations using the consistent multi - fluid advection ( cma ) method of @xcite .",
    "we use a computational grid in spherical polar coordinates consisting of @xmath15 zones in @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18-direction .",
    "the equidistant angular grid has a resolution of @xmath19 in @xmath17-direction and @xmath20 in @xmath18-direction , respectively , covering the whole sphere except for a ( double ) cone with a half opening angle of @xmath21 around the symmetry axis of the coordinate system ( i.e. , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 ) .",
    "reflective boundary conditions are imposed in @xmath17-direction , and periodic ones in @xmath18-direction .",
    "the clipping of the computational grid around the symmetry axis avoids a too restrictive cfl time step condition .",
    "we have not observed any numerical artifacts as consequences of this grid constraint .",
    "the radial mesh is logarithmically spaced between a time - dependent inner boundary , initially located at a radius of 200 km , and a fixed outer boundary at @xmath24 cm .",
    "it has a maximum resolution of 2 km at the inner boundary , and a resolution of @xmath25 cm at the outer one ( corresponding to a roughly constant relative radial resolution @xmath26 ) .",
    "we allow for free outflow at the outer boundary , and impose a reflective boundary condition at the inner edge of the radial grid .    during the simulation we move ( approximately every 100th timestep ) the inner radial boundary to larger and larger radii to relax the cfl condition .",
    "this cutting of the computational grid reduces the number of ( the logarithmically spaced ) radial zones from 1200 at the beginning to about 400 towards the end of the simulation , but involves only the innermost few percent of the initial envelope mass .",
    "we convinced ourselves by means of 2d test calculations that this removal of mass has no effect on the dynamics and mixing occurring at larger radii ( the cut radius exceeds at no time a few percent of the radius of the rayleigh - taylor finger tips ) .",
    "the initial model used for our 3d simulations is based on 3d hydrodynamic explosion models of @xcite , who followed the onset and early development of neutrino - driven explosions in 3d with the same code , numerical setup , and input physics as described in all details for 1d and 2d simulations in @xcite .",
    "these runs were started from 1d stellar collapse models a few milliseconds after core bounce .",
    "the explosion was initiated and powered by the energy input of neutrinos in the postshock layer , where vigorous convective activity was present and supported the revival of the stalled prompt shock .",
    "a defined value of the explosion energy was obtained by suitably choosing the magnitude of the neutrino luminosities that were imposed at the retreating inner grid boundary , which replaced the excised , contracting dense core of the forming neutron star .",
    "the stellar progenitor considered here is a spherically symmetric model of a @xmath27 blue supergiant with a radius of @xmath28 cm ( * ? ? ?",
    "* woosley , private communication ; see also kifonidis et al .",
    "2003 ) . since the models of @xcite included only the central part of the star out to the middle of the c / o shell at @xmath29 cm , the envelope of the progenitor had to be added for the long - time simulations presented here .",
    "the @xmath27 blue supergiant stellar progenitor model was evolved by @xcite using a nuclear reaction network including a large set of nuclei .",
    "however , @xcite did not consider nuclear burning , and he included only a small number of nuclear species ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 representing the heavy element fraction ) in their simulations to save computational costs . for our initial model we kept the nuclear composition of the 3d explosion model of @xcite inside the shock radius , redefining @xmath33 into @xmath34 .",
    "the nuclear composition at radii greater than the shock radius was taken from the @xmath27 progenitor model .",
    "@xcite simulated one 3d hydrodynamic explosion model with @xmath35 angular resolution , which reached a final time of 0.58s after bounce , and another one with @xmath36 angular resolution , which covered an evolution time of 1s after core bounce .",
    "although both models were exploited for our study , we report here only on simulations using the former model that according to the data of @xcite has an ( unsaturated ) explosion energy of @xmath37erg .",
    "the deformation of the shock front at @xmath38s after core bounce and the asymmetry of the entropy distribution behind the shock in the form of rising , inflating hot plumes and infalling , narrow , cool downflows are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : inimod ] .",
    "the structure of the explosion at this time looks very similar to comparable results by @xcite . besides following the shock s propagation through the stellar envelope of this initial model with our 3d code",
    ", we also performed a 3d simulation where we artificially increased the explosion energy of this initial model to @xmath39erg by extending the thermal energy input as accomplishable by ongoing neutrino heating .",
    "we used a tabulated eos @xcite that considers contributions of an arbitrarily degenerate and relativistic electron - positron gas , of a photon gas , and of a set of ideal boltzmann gases , consisting of the eight nuclear species ( @xmath31 , @xmath30 , @xmath32 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath34 ) included in our initial model .",
    "note that the pre - shock layers contained only a small region of silicon at the time the explosion model of @xcite was adopted as initial data for our long - time supernova runs . since nuclear burning",
    "was not taken into account in our simulations , but it is possible that this silicon will be explosively burned to nickel , we lumped the small amount of silicon and the iron - group elements in the postshock layer together to what we followed as @xmath34 in our hydrodynamic calculations .",
    "we performed a set of thirteen 2d and three 3d simulations and compared the results obtained in three dimensions to those of the corresponding 2d models . in this paper",
    "we focus our discussion on one 3d model that has an explosion energy of @xmath5ergs .",
    "the main findings for this particular 3d model are qualitatively similar to those we obtained for less energetic 3d explosions , but the resulting maximum values for the asymptotic clump velocities vary with the explosion energy roughly as @xmath44 .",
    "the 2d simulations reported here were started from different meridional slices of the 3d initial explosion model .",
    "this ensures as much similarity of the initial conditions as possible and the same numerical resolution for the 2d and 3d runs .",
    "but the differences between the chosen slices give rise to some variation of the initial asymmetry and explosion energy among the various 2d models , which manifests itself both in different clump structures and velocities , and the amount of mixing in the stellar envelope .",
    "a set of 13 meridional 2d slices was placed at azimuthal angles of 4 , 36 , 76 , 108 , 128 , 148 , 180 , 220 , 228 , 252 , 292 , 324 , and 360 degrees .",
    "three of these slices ( at 128 , 220 , and 228 degrees ) were chosen at locations where the growth of rayleigh - taylor fingers was observed to be particularly strong in 3d .",
    "this guaranteed that such regions were not missed by our comparison of 2d and 3d calculations .",
    "it turned out that the largest 3d rayleigh - taylor structures at late stages develop in the directions of the biggest initial buoyant bubbles , expanding towards the bottom edge and upper right corner ( at six oclock and one oclock , respectively ) of fig .  [",
    "fig : inimod ] .    both in the 3d and 2d simulations we neglected the influence of gravity on the motion of the ejecta .",
    "while this has no important impact on the dynamics of the expanding ejecta , the amount of fallback is underestimated .",
    "however , that way we could avoid the accumulation of mass near the inner ( reflecting ) radial boundary which would have implied a considerably more restrictive cfl condition .     +     +",
    "the dynamical evolution of the explosion after its launch by neutrino energy deposition and the growth of instabilities in the considered 15.5@xmath0 progenitor were described in much detail by @xcite .",
    "it was shown there that the asymmetries associated with the convective activity developing in the postshock region during the neutrino - heating phase act as seeds of secondary rayleigh - taylor instabilities at the composition interfaces of the exploding star . at about 100@xmath3s dense rayleigh - taylor fingers containing the metals ( c , o , si , iron - group elements )",
    "have grown out of a compressed shell of matter left behind by the shock passing through the si / o and ( c+o)/he interfaces .",
    "these fingers grow quickly in length and while extending into the helium shell , fragment into ballistically moving clumps and filaments that propagate faster than the expansion of their environment .",
    "while for a 2d model with explosion energy around 1.8@xmath45erg the si and ni containing structures still move with nearly 4000@xmath3km@xmath3s@xmath4 ( oxygen has velocities up to even 5000@xmath3km@xmath3s@xmath4 ) at 300@xmath3s , a strong deceleration occurs when the metal clumps enter the relatively dense he - shell that forms after the shock passage through the he / h interface . at @xmath46s the metal carrying clumps have dissipated their excess kinetic energy and propagate with the same speed as the helium material in their surroundings . in the presence of a hydrogen envelope and the corresponding deceleration of the shock as it propagates through the inner regions of the hydrogen layer ( in which case the helium `` wall '' below the he / h interface builds up )",
    ", @xcite could not observe any metal clumps that achieve to penetrate into the hydrogen envelope , in contrast to what was observed in the case of sn1987a .",
    "the 2d calculations performed in the course of the present work confirm these findings ( when the velocities are appropriately rescaled with @xmath47 to account for the lower explosion energies of @xmath48erg considered here compared to roughly twice this value employed by kifonidis et al .",
    "the evolution as well as the final results for the mass distributions of different chemical elements in velocity space and mass space are in good quantitative agreement with the models of @xcite , although the latter had much superior numerical resolution because of the use of a sophisticated adaptive mesh refinement algorithm .",
    "we are therefore confident that at least with respect to gross ( quasi-1d ) features , the results presented here are numerically converged , even if many of the structural details , including plumes and bullets , may not be numerically converged .",
    "@xcite , investigating explosions also with @xmath49erg , proposed a cure of the metal - h mixing problem by invoking a sufficiently large dipolar or quadrupolar asymmetry of the beginning explosion with a globally aspherical shock wave .",
    "this was motivated by recent hydrodynamical studies that show that large - amplitude , low-@xmath50 mode oscillations ( @xmath50 defining the order of an expansion in spherical harmonics ) due to the standing accretion shock instability ( sasi ) can be an important ingredient in the explosion mechanism and in the sequence of processes that leads to observed asymmetries of supernova explosions and neutron star kicks ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "this on the one hand led to higher initial maximum velocities of the metal - rich clumps and thus their faster propagation through the he core on a timescale shorter than the build - up of the thick he `` wall '' that prevented their penetration into the hydrogen shell in the older calculations . on the other hand it triggered the growth of richtmyer - meshkov instability ( rmi ) at the he / h interface due to the deposition of vorticity by the shock .",
    "this led to strong mixing of hydrogen inward in mass space and down to low velocities , an effect that has turned out to be necessary to explain the shape of the light curve maximum in the case of sn1987a @xcite .",
    "these conclusions , however , were based on 2d models .",
    "therefore the question remained whether 3d might yield differences and whether also in 3d one would have to advocate a pronounced global low-@xmath50 mode asphericity of the beginning explosion as an explanation of the high velocities ( @xmath51km@xmath3s@xmath4 ) of nickel clumps in the hydrogen shell and of the strong inward mixing of hydrogen observed in sn1987a .",
    "the 3d simulations performed in the present work demonstrate that this is not the case and the mentioned observational features can be accounted for by 3d models even with explosion energies around @xmath5ergs for the considered progenitor star .    in order to quantify the global shock deformation of our 3d initial models",
    "compared to the 2d cases investigated by @xcite , we did not perform an analysis in terms of an expansion in spherical harmonics modes . instead",
    ", sizeable differences become obvious already when a tri - axial ellipsoid is constructed as envelope of the bumpy shock surface obtained by @xcite such that the major axis of the ellipsoid coincides with the direction of the strongest shock expansion .",
    "while the 3d model used for the calculations of the present paper has an axis ratio of 1.04:1.02:1.00 at @xmath52s after bounce  another 3d explosion run of @xcite yields 1.16:1.06:1.00 at @xmath53s  , the shocks of the 2d configurations studied by @xcite typically had much larger axis ratios of about 1.5:1.0 .",

    "resolution in azimuthal and 0.935@xmath150 in lateral direction were the best we could allow for as a compromise between accuracy and cpu - time requirements . although our 2d results are in reasonably good agreement with the 2d amr calculations performed by @xcite , we still think that simulations with varied mesh size or an amr code would be useful to confirm our findings in 3d .    in this pilot study",
    "we were aiming at a first analysis of fundamental differences between mixing instabilities during the long - time evolution of supernova explosions in two and three dimensions rather than attempting to match the observational appearance of special events like , e.g. , sn  1987a ( although we used this supernova as the best studied one for our motivation and also referred to it when our findings agreed with basic features that sn  1987a is likely to have in common with a wider class of cases ) . on the basis of our results , which appear suitable to account for the strong inward mixing of hydrogen and outward mixing of metals that is needed to explain the smoothness of the light curve as well as the early appearance of x - ray and gamma - ray emission of sn  1987a",
    ", we therefore do not conclude that all observational properties of this supernova can be reproduced by a relatively weakly aspherical initiation of the explosion .",
    "more simulations are needed to clarify this point , in particular by employing a stellar model that is compatible with all knowledge acquired about the progenitor structure of sn  1987a during the past 20 years .",
    "while we think that the 2d/3d differences found in our investigation are likely to be generic , the extent of the radial mixing , the size and mass distribution of the metal fingers , their velocities and spatial distribution , and the composition of individual clumps must be expected to depend strongly on the structure of the progenitor star , the explosion energy , and the initial asymmetry of the blast .",
    "having advanced the modeling of mixing instabilities in supernova explosions to the third dimension , we therefore plan to direct our focus to the exploration of a wider variety of progenitor stars with the goal to establish a link between explosion models and observations . besides sn  1987a , the geometry of the cassiopeia  a remnant has been studied observationally in very much detail ( e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "it exhibits properties such as the radial turnover of the metal core that are compatible with the findings of this work , and a directional asymmetry that can not be accounted for by models constrained to axial symmetry .",
    "therefore not only the differences of 3d versus 2d results reported in this paper but also observational properties of supernovae and supernova remnants point to the indispensability of modeling the explosions in three dimensions .",
    "an interesting question certainly is , whether the jet - like , silicon - rich features observed in cas  a could be morphologically linked to the structures seen as the fastest and most massive rayleigh - taylor fingers in our simulations . although our results appear suggestive in this respect , a convincing answer requires investigations of progenitors and explosion parameters fitting this remnant as well as a more complete consideration of the nuclear composition of the ejecta .",
    "we thank l.  scheck for providing us with his 3d explosion models as initial data for our studies , v.  utrobin for sharing with us his insight into modelling observations of sn1987a , and m.  rampp ( rechenzentrum garching ) for his great assistance in the visualization of our 3d data .",

    "<S> we present the first three - dimensional ( 3d ) simulations of the large - scale mixing that takes place in the shock - heated stellar layers ejected in the explosion of a 15.5@xmath0 blue supergiant star . </S>",
    "<S> the blast is initiated and powered by neutrino - energy deposition behind the stalled shock by means of choosing sufficiently high neutrino luminosities from the contracting , nascent neutron star , whose high - density core is excised and replaced by a retreating inner grid boundary . the outgoing supernova shock is followed beyond its breakout from the stellar surface more than two hours after the core collapse . </S>",
    "<S> violent convective overturn in the post - shock layer causes the explosion to start with significant large - scale asphericity , which acts as a trigger of the growth of rayleigh - taylor instabilities at the composition interfaces of the exploding star . despite the absence of a strong richtmyer - meshkov instability at the h / he interface , which only a largely deformed shock could instigate , deep inward mixing of hydrogen is found as well as fast - moving , metal - rich clumps penetrating with high velocities far into the hydrogen envelope of the star as observed , for example , in the case of supernova  1987a . </S>",
    "<S> also individual clumps containing a sizeable fraction of the ejected iron - group elements ( up to several @xmath1 ) are obtained in some models . </S>",
    "<S> the metal core of the progenitor is partially turned over with nickel - dominated fingers overtaking oxygen - rich bullets and both nickel and oxygen moving well ahead of the material from the carbon layer . comparing with corresponding two - dimensional ( axially symmetric ; 2d ) calculations , we determine the growth of the rayleigh - taylor fingers to be faster , the deceleration of the dense metal - carrying clumps in the helium and hydrogen layers to be reduced , the asymptotic clump velocities in the hydrogen shell to be higher ( up to @xmath24500@xmath3km@xmath3s@xmath4 for the considered progenitor and an explosion energy of @xmath5ergs , instead of @xmath62000@xmath3km@xmath3s@xmath4 in 2d ) , and the outward radial mixing of heavy elements and inward mixing of hydrogen to be more efficient in 3d than in 2d . </S>",
    "<S> we present a simple argument that explains these results as a consequence of the different action of drag forces on moving objects in the two geometries . </S>"
