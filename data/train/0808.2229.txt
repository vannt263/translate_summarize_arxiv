    "the study of quasi two - dimensional ( 2d ) materials with frustrated magnetic exchange interactions is a field of intense research .",

    "fig.[disp ] clarifies the type of critical points that have to be expected and is a first indication of the qualitative relevance of @xmath3 on the possible ground states of the model . to obtain a quantitative picture ,",
    "the stability region of the plaquette phase in @xmath1-@xmath2-@xmath3 space will be studied in detail in the following sections .",
    "in this section we discuss the quantum critical lines , resulting from the closure of the plaquette triplet gap , which resembles second order quantum phase transitions .",
    "this will give us a quantitative estimate of the stability region of the plaquette phase .",
    "in particular we are interested in a possible adiabatic connection of the isolated bare plaquette phase ( with only local @xmath92 ) up to the value of @xmath30 .",
    "this analysis is shown in fig.[gap00pipij1j2j3p ] which depicts the borders of the stability region projected onto @xmath93 plane , taking @xmath3 as parameter .",
    "fig.[gap00pipij1j2j3p ] displays two families of critical lines , corresponding to the closure of the triplet gap @xmath94 for @xmath88 and @xmath95 , with dotted and solid lines , respectively .",
    "first , it is obvious that independently of @xmath2 and @xmath3 the plaquette phase extends from the origin , @xmath96 ( not shown in fig.[gap00pipij1j2j3p ] ) up to @xmath97 below which there are no signals of triplet softening .",
    "second , we focus on the @xmath98 instability . in the case of @xmath4 , as can be observed from the figure , the critical line almost reaches , but does not cross the line @xmath30 . in other words : the @xmath1-@xmath2 model does not show a plaquette phase .",
    "this result is consistent with the previous se analysis on @xmath1-@xmath2 model in ref.@xcite .     obtained by means of plain series and a particular dlog - pad approximant along",
    "selected straight line paths in couplings space , for a case in which the triplet gap closes at @xmath30 .",
    "results from reintegrated dlog - pad(3,1 ) , plain series at @xmath99 and @xmath84 are shown with solid , dot - dashed and dashed lines , respectively .",
    "for @xmath100 the agreement is very good in all cases .",
    "closer to @xmath1-@xmath2-@xmath3 model , i.e. to @xmath30 , clear differences between the dlog - pad and the plain series arise.,width=253 ]    third , we consider the simultaneous effect of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "as can be observed in fig.[gap00pipij1j2j3p ] , increasing the values of @xmath3 enlarges the region of stability of the plaquette phase in the @xmath93 plane in terms of the critical line @xmath88 ( solid lines ) .",
    "most important , finite @xmath3 helps to stabilize the plaquette phase at @xmath30 .",
    "in fact , already for @xmath101 the critical line crosses @xmath30 . for @xmath102 the solid critical line merges with the lower righthand corner of fig.[gap00pipij1j2j3p ] and the plaquette phase extends over all of the @xmath93 plane shown .",
    "these results are consistent with ref.@xcite .",
    "now we turn to the plaquette phase stability region , projected onto @xmath93 plane , limited by the critical lines @xmath103 ( dotted lines in fig.[gap00pipij1j2j3p ] ) .",
    "we find a similar tendency as for @xmath104 , i.e. the region of stability of the plaquette phase in the @xmath93 plane is enlarged by increasing @xmath3 . in this case",
    "however the impact of @xmath3 is somewhat less significant as compared to @xmath2 .",
    "technically , the critical lines of fig.[gap00pipij1j2j3p ] have been obtained using dlog - pad analysis , rather than the plain series .",
    "this is known to improve the accuracy of locating the critical points significantly . for details on this technique",
    "we refer the reader to the literature @xcite . in order to work with single variable dlog - pads",
    "we have scanned the exchange coupling space by means of straight lines , parametrized according to @xmath105 . for fixed values of @xmath106 and @xmath107",
    "this amounts to a single variable , i.e. @xmath1 .    to assess the impact of the dlog - pad analysis , we show its result for @xmath108 , for a particular dlog - pad approximant and a case in which the triplet gap closes at @xmath30 ( fig.[dlp ] ) .",
    "a similar analysis has been done for all the critical lines calculated , including several dlog - pad approximants in each case . in this figure",
    ", the solid line refers to the reintegrated dlog - pad @xmath109 , and the dot - dashed and dashed lines show the plain series at o@xmath110 and o@xmath111 , respectively .",
    "from there it is clear that for @xmath112 the agreement between the reintegrated dlog - pad and the se at o@xmath110 and o@xmath111 is very good .",
    "in fact , all plots are indistinguishable on the scale used .",
    "this provides a qualitative measure of the convergence of the series . for @xmath113 and closer to criticality ( at @xmath30 in this case ) however ,",
    "we rely on the dlog - pad technique in order to describe the closure of the gap .",
    "here we analyze the extent of the plaquette phase on the @xmath2-@xmath3 plane at @xmath30 , i.e. for the actual @xmath1-@xmath2-@xmath3 model , written in units of @xmath1 .",
    "as it was mentioned in the introduction , ed calculations for @xmath1-@xmath2-@xmath3 model , using the complete hilbert space and a restricted space of short - range dimer singlets , provide strong evidence for the existence of a plaquette phase around the line @xmath114 at @xmath30 , in particular for @xmath26 @xcite . in this section",
    ", we will extend this study by specifying the extension of this phase as obtained from se . to this end",
    ", we proceed as in the previous section , i.e. the critical lines are obtained by analyzing the closure of the triplet gap , i.e. solutions of @xmath85 .    in fig.[ppj2j3j11 ]",
    "we show the corresponding results .",
    "the lower and upper critical lines mark the triplet softening at @xmath115 and @xmath104 , respectively , and enclose the region of a finite triplet gap . i.e. this region refers to the plaquette phase , labeled by p. in this figure , dlog - pad approximants are depicted by solid lines , and the results obtained by employing the @xmath84 plain series by dashed lines .",
    "we note that the critical lines shown from dlog - pad approximants in fig.[ppj2j3j11 ] are consistent with the pairs of ( @xmath116 ) at @xmath30 shown in fig.[gap00pipij1j2j3p ] .",
    "although , as in the previous section , we base our results on the dlog - pad analysis , the agreement between the plain series and the dlog - pad approximants can be used to assess the convergence of the series . from fig.[ppj2j3j11 ] , it is clear that the best agreement for the lower critical line is found in the intermediate region , i.e where @xmath117 .",
    "for the special case of @xmath23 , i.e. for the pure @xmath1-@xmath3 model , it has been conjectured that the classical critical line to nel phase at @xmath118 ( @xmath30 in our case ) should be shifted to larger values in the quantum model @xcite . for all dlog - pads analyzed",
    ", our results confirm this conjecture , as e.g. for the @xmath109 dlog - pad approximant of the lower critical line shown in fig.[ppj2j3j11 ] .",
    "in conclusion we find that the plaquette phase extends considerably around the straight line of maximal frustration , connecting @xmath119 with @xmath120 , which was studied in ref.@xcite .",
    "in particular , as it can be seen in fig.[ppj2j3j11 ] , the upper critical line is rather far from the line of maximal frustration .",
    "additionally , in the limiting case @xmath4 , we remain with the @xmath1-@xmath2 model . for the latter , and as shown in the right lower corner of fig.[ppj2j3j11 ] , and unlike the plain series , the dlog - pad analysis suggests that the critical line does not intersect the @xmath2 axis .",
    "i.e. we find no stability of the plaquette phase .",
    "this is in agreement with the se results of ref.@xcite .",
    "yet , the proximity between the critical line and the @xmath2 axis calls for caution on this finding with respect to the convergence of the se in this parameter range .",
    "to summarize , using series expansion , based on flow equations we have analyzed the zero temperature properties of the 2d spin-@xmath7 @xmath1-@xmath2-@xmath3 afm .",
    "starting from the limit of decoupled plaquettes of a generalized @xmath1-@xmath2-@xmath3 model we have evaluated three - parameter series up to @xmath84 in the interplaquette exchange couplings @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 for the ground state energy and for the triplet dispersion .",
    "we find a rather large range of @xmath121 couplings which adiabatically connects to the state of isolated plaquettes and hosts a plaquette phase which is stable against second order quantum phase transitions into magnetic states .",
    "our findings corroborate and enhance related predictions of mambrini _ et al . _",
    "@xcite on the location of a stable plaquette phase at @xmath122 .    for the particular case of the @xmath1-@xmath2 model at @xmath4 , and consistently with results obtained in ref.@xcite",
    ", our calculation predicts that the plaquette phase is not stable in the parameter range which we have investigated .",
    "however , higher order series expansions seem very desirable to render such results more reliable .",
    "in particular , from our series we are reluctant to draw any definite conclusions about the controversial region @xmath4 and @xmath123 .",
    "finally , we emphasize that our analysis has been focused on the stability of the plaquette phase with respect to second order transitions driven by one - particle ( triplet ) excitations .",
    "further instabilities , like first order transitions or level crossings of excited states , other than elementary triplets , could give rise to further reduction of the plaquette regime and have not been considered here . along this line , the two - particle sector , which includes singlet excitations , may play a role that can be analyzed using our se technique .",
