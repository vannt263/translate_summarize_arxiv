    "in the last few years , the demands for more efficient , reliable wireless systems induced network designers to think about alternative ways to supplement centralized cellular models .",
    "one interesting idea is to build a multi - tier network where macro - base - stations coexist with a great number of smaller cells , which in turn operate in a more distributed fashion ( e.g. the concept of femto - cell networks @xcite ) .",
    "departing from the centralized approach whose capacity are fairly well characterized by shannon theory , the limits of distributed systems that work in interference - limited regimes are unknown except for few specific cases , as discussed in @xcite . in the following , we will discuss the main results on interference networks and how the concept of cognitive radio introduced in @xcite is important in this context .      in 1978",
    "carleial formally stated the interference channel problem using arguments from information theory @xcite .",
    "since then , several results have been proposed for the interference channel as discussed in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch . 6 ) .",
    "although these works shed light on the problem , even the capacity region of the simplest two - source - two - destination setting is still an open problem .",
    "moreover , when multiples sources and destinations are considered , such capacity regions becomes even more elusive .",
    "knowing such difficulties , some researchers have started investigating alternative approaches to better understand the limits of wireless networks with multiple communication pairs . gupta and kumar introduced in @xcite the transport capacity metric to determine how many bits - meter a wireless network with uniformly distributed nodes can reliably sustain when its density grows to infinite ( asymptotic analysis ) .",
    "after this milestone , many other papers have focused on a similar idea , finding the transport capacity scaling laws for different scenarios and under different assumptions .",
    "the monograph @xcite compiles some of such studies .",
    "franceschetti et al .",
    "presented another important result in @xcite , where they applied an unconventional method to find the physical limit of wireless networks by using laws of electrodynamics .",
    "the authors further extended this approach in @xcite and determined the degrees of freedom of wireless networks based on electromagnetic theory .",
    "nevertheless both franceschetti s and gupta s lines of research strongly rely on asymptotic behaviors when the number of nodes infinitely grows , which may give an unclear picture of the actual physical or medium access control network layers design . bearing this aspect in mind , weber et al . applied in @xcite a statistical approach to characterize the throughput of wireless networks and then defined the transmission capacity as the highest spatial throughput achievable without exceeding a maximum link outage probability , using the density of active links as the optimization variable .",
    "an important aspect of this work is the use of stochastic geometry @xcite to characterize the node spatial distribution as a poisson point process ( ppp ) .",
    "thereafter different strategies used in the wireless communications have been investigated such as interference cancellation , threshold transmissions , guard zones , bandwidth partitioning amongst others ; the reference @xcite compiles these results .",
    "in addition to them , we find in the literature other contributions using a similar approach .",
    "for example , vaze studied in @xcite the throughput - delay - reliability trade - off in multi - hop networks using the metric random access transport capacity , which is an extension of the transmission capacity for multi - hop systems ( * ? ? ?",
    "4.2 ) . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors derived closed - form expressions for the throughput optimization under packet loss and queue stability constraints . in @xcite a revisited version of the transmission capacity",
    "was proposed to compare different modulation - coding schemes . the work @xcite presents the transmission capacity optimization in term of the number of allowed retransmissions considering different medium access control protocols , which can be either synchronous or asynchronous .",
    "ganti et al",
    ". generalized in @xcite the transmission capacity for different fading and node distributions for the high signal - to - interference regime .",
    "apart from these papers that focus on the statistic quantification of the spatial throughput of wireless networks , the use of models from stochastic geometry dates back the early 80 s , when takagi and kleinrock firstly introduced the idea of evaluating the aggregate interference power of poisson distributed interfering nodes @xcite .",
    "thereafter , the subject has greatly developed and we can cite @xcite as relevant tutorials on how to apply stochastic geometry when analysing wireless systems . as we will see later ,",
    "this approach is important when dealing with cognitive networks , where self - organizing solutions are employed in a distributed manner .",
    "let us start presenting a brief description of complex systems from the @xcite : `` a complex system consists of diverse entities that interact in a network or contact structure  a geographic space , a computer network , or a market .",
    "these entities actions are interdependent  what one protein , ant , person , or nation does materially affects others . in navigating within a complex system , entities follow rules , by which i mean prescriptions for certain behaviours in particular circumstances '' .",
    "for example , the tragedy of the commons problem described in @xcite illustrates a counter - intuitive feature of many independent and rational agents sharing a common pool of limited resources . in this scenario ,",
    "the agents optimize their own pay - offs in a selfish manner , i.e. find their individual global optimum , regardless of the others .",
    "consequently , if every single agent takes the same rational decision , the shared resource will fade away after some time .",
    "this problem is very context - dependent ; for example , both fishing in a lake and forest harvesting can be viewed as a tragedy of the commons class of problem , but the solution applied for each case tends to differ as the internal constraints of each system are different . for wireless networks",
    ", the authors in @xcite showed that the spatial throughput optimization under packet loss and queue stability constraints can be also viewed as a tragedy of the commons problem .",
    "another issue related to complex systems refers to the interplay between coordination and cooperation . in game theory ,",
    "the prisoners dilemma is a good example of how coordination based on side information is important to optimize the system @xcite . in this game ,",
    "rational agents , which can not communicate to each other , should choose whether to cooperate or not .",
    "if both cooperate , they get a higher pay - off than do not . however , if one cooperate and the other does not , the non - cooperative agent will obtain a higher pay - off .",
    "this fact leads to both agents not cooperating , which in turn provides lower pay - offs .",
    "one interesting work was recently proposed by nowak @xcite , where the author describe different ways that cooperative behaviour can emerge in evolutionary systems .",
    "cooperative solutions are also important when dealing with co - channel interference in wireless networks . for example , the authors in @xcite employed game theory to build an algorithm to find coalitions of femto - cells that are willing to cooperate . in @xcite",
    "distributed coordination mechanisms were employed to control the aggregate interference level in stand - alone femto - cell networks .",
    "interestingly , these examples are based on self - organizing solutions , which refers to decentralized systems that are functional even without any central controlling entity ( even though following interaction rules ) .",
    "many illustrations of this can be found in nature as , for instance , ants working in colonies , neurons building a capable brain etc .",
    "it is important to say that , different from these solutions that have emerged naturally , engineering systems do not accept outputs without a minimum quality requirement and therefore self - organization should be carefully designed , where the cognitive abilities and interaction rules should be well understood .    knowing the potential and the challenges of self - organization in engineering , haykin proposed in his seminal work @xcite the definition of cognitive radio : `` ( ... ) intelligent wireless communication system that is aware of its environment and uses the methodology of understanding - by - building to learn from the environment and adapt to statistical variations in the input stimuli , with two primary objectives in mind : highly reliable communication whenever and wherever needed ; efficient utilization of the radio spectrum '' .",
    "this work indicates the direction to design more efficient wireless systems and thereafter the cognitive radio research have been rapidly growing .      motivated by the cognitive radio idea and the results presented in @xcite where the authors showed the importance of location information to improve the throughput of wireless networks , this paper focuses on studying wireless networks where every transmitter  which are spatially distributed as a poisson point process  is able to use in a cognitive way the knowledge of its relative distances to the other transmitters for each different spatial realization .",
    "following the results due to baccelli et al .",
    "@xcite , we apply two different decoding rules : _ treating interference as noise _  the ian rule  and _ _ joint detection of the strongest interferers messages and treating the others as noise _ _  the opt rule . assuming that the aggregate interference can be approximated by the strongest interferer treated as noise",
    ", we derive an approximate probability density function ( pdf ) of the achievable rate in bits / s / hz that a typical link can sustain for the above decoding rules .",
    "if the network follows the bipolar model @xcite , the expected maximum spatial throughput of the network in bits / s / hz / m@xmath0 can be also approximated using those pdfs . for comparison purposes ,",
    "we consider the non - cognitive approach where transmitters use the same fixed coding rates ( which is the most usual approach found in the literature , as in @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "iv ) , @xcite ) , regardless of the specific spatial realization considered .",
    "we then compute the highest spatial throughput for this setting by optimizing of the expected spatial throughput over different spatial realizations , where the optimization variable is the ( symmetric ) rate that the transmitters code their messages .",
    "differently from the former scenario where the coding rates are tuned to be the highest achievable ones given the relative nodes positions for each different spatial realization , the fixed rate scheme only cares about the average behaviour of the network , resulting in decoding errors ( outage events ) for links whose capacity is below that predetermined rate .",
    "we analytically prove that , under the same assumptions , the non - cognitive strategy always performs worse than the cognitive one .",
    "our numerical results confirm this difference and illustrate the advantages of using opt over ian .",
    "we also carry out an extensive simulation campaign to validate our findings and justify why our analysis is still relevant even when our approximations are loose  although the closest - interferer approximation becomes looser when the network density grows , it follows that the qualitative relation and the quantitative ratio between the different strategies are maintained .",
    "besides we discuss the feasibility of the decoding rules and optimization strategies for different mobility patterns . the cognitive approach is a feasible solution in ( quasi-)static topologies , while the fixed rate optimization with ian turns out to be the most appropriate choice in highly mobile topologies , .",
    "the rest of this paper is divided as follows . in section [ sec_capacity_region ] ,",
    "we revisit the capacity region of gaussian point - to - point codes over interference channels @xcite and then define the spatial throughput of wireless networks .",
    "section [ sec_spatial_poisson ] introduces the network model and the expected maximum spatial throughput using the cognitive approach .",
    "section [ sec_ian ] analyses the ian decoder , while the opt is the focus of section [ sec_opt ] .",
    "a comparison between the cognitive and the non - cognitive approaches is found in section [ sec_sym ] .",
    "we discuss both the accuracy of our approximations and implementation issues in section [ sec_discussions ] , followed by the final remarks in section [ sec_final ] .",
    "this section reviews the capacity region of gaussian point - to - point ( g - ptp ) codes for an arbitrary number of communication pairs as stated by baccelli et al . in (",
    "ii ) . for convenience",
    "let us assume a network with area @xmath1 [ m@xmath0 ] where @xmath3 source - destination pairs ( also called transmitter - receiver pairs ) coexist .",

    "receiver @xmath6 ( rx@xmath17 ) .",
    "we assume that every transmitted signal is subject to the same power constrain of @xmath18 [ w / hz ] such that the received signal between tx@xmath16 and rx@xmath17 is constrained by @xmath19 .",
    "each transmitter node uses a g - ptp code with a set of randomly and independently generated codewords @xmath20 following independent and identically distributed @xmath21 sequences such that @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and \\ ; i \\in [ 0,\\ ; k]$ ] .",

    "ii ) .    this capacity region assumes a decoder that treats some of the interferers as noise , while others have their messages jointly decoded with the desired one .",
    "in fact , this result is the basis of the opt strategy mentioned in the previous section and further studied in section [ sec_opt ] .",
    "in this section , we will apply the results previously stated to establish an approximation for the spatial throughput of bipolar cognitive networks with transmitter nodes distributed according to a ppp .",
    "but before that , let us define the spatial throughput and its maximum value using theorem [ the_cap_reg ] for a given spatial realization of the network as follows :    _ let @xmath1 [ m@xmath0 ] be the network area and @xmath42 be the number of active links in @xmath1 .",

    "we further argue that our approximation has no effect on the trade - off analysis done in this paper and figure [ figure_simulation ] illustrates this fact by showing that the opt always outperforms ian in similar scales : the ratios @xmath225 obtained via simulation or via our approximations have similar values when considering the same @xmath49 . as the proposed formulation provides a computationally simpler way to assess the network performance than numerical simulations , we reinforce the contribution of this paper even when our approximations provide less accurate bounds .",
    "all in all , we believe that our main messages  opt is better than ian , and cognitive strategy is better than the non - cognitive one  are unaffected by our approximations , which are shown by both qualitative relations and quantitative ratios between our analytical and simulated results . despite of these facts , the optimal strategy is infeasible for practical implementation as discussed in the following .      throughout this paper",
    "we have shown that the best design option in terms of spatial throughput is to employ opt decoders and apply the cognitive scheme .",
    "this solution , however , has downsides : ( i ) rxs require the knowledge of the codebooks of the jointly decoded messages and ( ii ) opt decoders are computationally more complex than ian .    knowing that , we argue that the use of either / both opt and/or cognitive strategy is infeasible for ( highly ) mobile topologies . under this topology , the neighbours of any given receiver change very fast , rendering the joint decoding procedure impossible .",
    "shopping malls and streets where people move frequently can exemplify this scenario .",
    "if this is the case , even though the configuration employing ian decoders with fixed rate optimization is far from the optimal performance , it is a more suitable choice .",
    "conversely , when ( quasi-)static networks are considered , the optimal strategy becomes viable . in this case , receiver nodes must known the codebooks of their strongest interfering nodes and jointly decode their messages .",
    "in addition , the links must coordinate their coding rates to be in the network capacity region .",
    "smart homes , industry plants and other kind of machine - to - machine communications can exemplify this mobility pattern . besides , there are other aspects that may be prohibitive for opt . for instance , many applications require secrecy and then the codebook knowledge makes opt infeasible even for static topologies .",
    "other applications need fast processing time , which is also infeasible when many interfering messages are jointly decoded . anyway",
    ", this dependence of the topology must be taken into account when the network is designed . furthermore , the mobility pattern of the network can also change over time  for example , offices during the night are quasi - static , while highly dynamic during parts of the working hours .",
    "all these aspects indicates the needs for ad hoc adaptive algorithms that estimate the network state and proceed with their optimization according to their cognitive ability . if the closest interferer treated as noise approximation gives a reliable indication , the results presented herein might even provide a practical way of implementing them .",
    "in this paper we studied the spatial throughput of cognitive networks using the gaussian point - to - point codes , where transmitter nodes use the location information of their receiver s closest interferer to tune their coding rates . assuming that the network follows the bipolar poisson model , we evaluated two different decoding rules : ( i ) treat all interfering messages as noise  ian , and ( ii ) jointly decode the messages whose detected power is higher than the desired message power while treat the remaining as noise  opt .",
    "we proposed an approximation of the expected highest spatial throughput for poisson distributed networks where transmitter nodes are able to cognitively tune their coding rates for each spatial realization based on the location information of the closest interferer of their respective receiver .",
    "we then stated several properties of our approximation using either decoders and showed that , when the same network density and decoding rules are assumed , the cognitive strategy always outperforms the non - cognitive one , where transmitters code their messages in order to optimize the expected spatial throughput using pre - determined fixed rates , regardless of a specific network realization .",
    "these results can be actually used to implement an ad hoc algorithm capable to adapt the coding rates based on estimated information about distances , network density and mobility .",
    "in fact , we have already identified the work done in @xcite as a potential starting point to further develop the theory presented here to more practical scenarios .",
