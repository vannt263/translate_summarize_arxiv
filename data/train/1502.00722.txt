    "the ernst metric @xcite , also known as the schwarzschild - melvin metric or the electrified / magnetized schwarzschild black hole , describes a black hole immersed in an uniform electric or magnetic field . in this paper we will distinguish the two cases by calling the former the _ electric _ ernst spacetime and the latter _ magnetic _ ernst spacetime . the solution can be derived by applying a harrison transformation @xcite to a seed metric taken to be the schwarzschild solution . the result is an exact solution to the einstein - maxwell equations parametrized by the black hole mass and the strength of the maxwell field .",
    "the spacetime curvature is caused by both the black hole and the electromagnetic field .",
    "the ernst solution was found just a year after wald considered kerr black holes immersed in a weak magnetic field @xcite . in wald",
    "s solution a ( test ) magnetic field is found by solving maxwell s equation in a kerr background .",
    "hence the field in wald s construction is a test field which does not influence the spacetime curvature and can be considered as a limiting special case of the full ernst solution .    despite being non - asymptotically flat",
    ", the magnetic ernst solution is a useful model which describes black holes in certain astrophysical situations .",
    "hence past work on geodesics focuses primarily on the magnetic case @xcite .",
    "it is likely that strong magnetic fields may exist in the vicinity of stellar mass and supermassive black holes .",
    "in particular , the motion of charged particles in this spacetime is studied in @xcite . the geodesic motion for null and timelike particles",
    "is considered in @xcite .",
    "some later works on this topic include @xcite .",
    "the motion of charged particles was also considered in the context of chaos and nonlinear dynamics in @xcite .    nevertheless , in most realistic astrophysical situations",
    "the magnetic field surrounding a black hole is relatively weak such that the influence on the spacetime curvature is fairly negligible @xcite .",
    "the motion of charged particles in this test field regime was studied in refs .",
    "@xcite , where the electromagnetic field does not influence the spacetime curvature and only affects motion of the charged particle via lorentz interactions .",
    "frolov and shoom @xcite , in particular , studied the case where the particle executes a curly cycloidlike trajectory which occurs due to the combination of a central gravitational force from the black hole on the particle together with a velocity - dependent outward lorentz force . in this paper",
    ", we will also consider a similar motion in the melvin spacetime , where , in the absence of a black hole , the inward gravitational force is provided by the magnetic field itself .",
    "the case of orbits around a black hole immersed in an electric field has received less attention compared to its magnetic counterpart .",
    "this case physically describes an electrically charged particle under the gravitational influence of the black hole and the axisymmetric electric field , in addition to a constant coulomb force in the @xmath0 direction .",
    "this can be viewed physically as a central force motion subject to an additional uniform constant force , we should expect some similarities to particle motion in the vacuum c - metric @xcite .",

    "this includes the motion of null ( lightlike ) particles .",
    "this case has already been thoroughly studied in refs .  @xcite using the hamilton - jacobi formalism . for completeness",

    "represents the field strength parameter for both the electric and magnetic ernst solutions , as they will be discussed separately in this paper .",
    "thus it will be clear from the context that @xmath3 represents the _ electric _ field strength for the electric ernst solution ( sec .",
    "[ ernste ] ) while it represents the _",
    "magnetic _ field strength in the analysis of the magnetic ernst solution ( sec .",
    "[ ernstm ] ) . ]",
    "if the black hole is immersed in a magnetic field , the maxwell potential is @xmath4 on the other hand , the maxwell potential corresponding to an electrified black hole is @xmath5 it is worth noting that with the presence of the electromagnetic field , the ernst solution is not asymptotically flat .",
    "the maxwell tensor for either case is given by @xmath6 .",
    "the metric ( [ ernst_metric ] ) , together with either ( [ a_m ] ) or ( [ a_e ] ) is a solution to the four - dimensional einstein - maxwell equations with zero cosmological constant .",
    "we can easily see that setting @xmath7 reduces the solution to that of melvin @xcite , while for @xmath8 we recover the usual schwarzschild solution .",
    "we also note that there are some useful symmetries of the metric . for the case of the magnetic ernst spacetime ,",
    "( [ ernst_metric ] ) and ( [ a_m ] ) are invariant under the transformation @xmath9 for the case of the electric ernst spacetime , the solutions ( [ ernst_metric ] ) and ( [ a_e ] ) are invariant under @xmath10 with these symmetries , we can consider only the case @xmath11 without loss of generality .",

    "the conserved quantities reduce the equations for @xmath22 and @xmath23 into first integrals : @xmath24 applying the euler - lagrange equation to the remaining two coordinates gives @xmath25 here , the primes appearing in @xmath26 indicate derivatives with respect to @xmath27 .",
    "the invariance of @xmath28 , together with ( [ ernste_cons ] ) , gives a first integral equation @xmath29 by appropriately rescaling the affine parameter @xmath14 , we can set the magnitude of @xmath30 to be unity if it is nonzero .",
    "therefore , for timelike particles we have @xmath31 , and @xmath32 for null ( massless ) particles .",
    "we note that due to the symmetry of the solution shown in ( [ ernste_sym ] ) , we may assume without loss of generality that both @xmath11 and @xmath33 .",
    "since if both are negative the above equations remain unchanged , if they have opposite signs , the resulting equations are equivalent under ( [ ernste_sym ] ) .",
    "if we set @xmath7 in the above equations , they reduce to the geodesic equations of the electric melvin spacetime , while setting @xmath8 reduces to the well - known geodesic equations around a schwarzschild black hole . furthermore , setting @xmath34 and neglecting terms of order @xmath35 and beyond describes the motion around a black hole immersed in a test electric field .",
    "a simpler , though slightly less rigorous way to describe this is obtained by setting @xmath36 in the above equations . in the test field regime , the electric field does not influence the spacetime curvature , hence its effect on the particle is purely electrodynamic in nature .      in the present case where the black hole is immersed in an electric field ,",
    "it is not possible to cast eq .",
    "( [ ernste_first ] ) in the form of of an effective potential equation .",
    "nevertheless , it is still possible to study the existence of bound and unbound orbits by rearranging to obtain @xmath37 from the above equation , we can find regions accessible to the particle where the coordinates @xmath27 and @xmath38 lead to positive values in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ ernste_veff ] ) .",
    "the boundaries of these regions are points where @xmath39 , and therefore represent turning points of the trajectory in which the particle reaches zero velocity . hence , in earlier works such as refs .",

    "as can be shown from the well - known schwarzschild geodesics , around the value of @xmath41 , the schwarzschild potential contains a finite well , in which the particle is in a bound orbit around the black hole @xcite .",
    "when @xmath21 is reduced to about to 3.5 , the potential barrier disappears and the particle may fall into the horizon at @xmath42 .    the electric field is turned on and increased in the second , third and fourth plots of each row . as we see by visual inspection , the accessible regions are mostly pushed below @xmath43 ( towards the north of the equator ) .",
    "this corresponds to the intuitive interpretation that the north - pointing electric field tends to push the positively charged particle along that direction . if the particle is negatively charged , or if the field points in the opposite direction , the particle will be pushed southwards , and the above diagrams should be reflected along the @xmath44 axis where the equations of motion are equivalent under ( [ ernste_sym ] ) .",

    "<S> the case of the magnetic ernst metric contains a limit which reduces to the melvin magnetic universe . in this case the equations of motion are solved to reveal cycloidlike or trochoidlike motion , similar to those found by frolov and shoom around black holes immersed in test magnetic fields . </S>"
