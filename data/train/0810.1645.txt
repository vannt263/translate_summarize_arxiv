    "@xcite however , scaling laws resulting from these models does not allow to interpret experimental results unambiguously , since this would require the access to asymptotic regimes of relaxation and hence enormously large time scales .",
    "moreover , different , sometimes even contradicting , models give rise to same scaling laws , discrediting their predictions . studying realistic models seems therefore to be a more promising way to elucidate mechanisms underlying spin - glass dynamics .",
    "there has been much work on the non - equilibrium behavior of edward - anderson ( ea ) spin - glass models .",
