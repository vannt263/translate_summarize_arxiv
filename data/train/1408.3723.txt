    "a surface is called minimal if its mean curvature vanishes everywhere carmo.minimal surfaces are among the most important objects studied in differential geometry .",

    "early , two problems were posed from the belgian physicist plateau and from the swedish mathematician bjrling in the 19-th century for minimal surfaces passing a curve .",
