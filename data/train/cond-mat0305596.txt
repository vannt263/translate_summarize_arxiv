    "according to our present understanding , the casimir effect is a phenomenon common to all systems characterized by fluctuating quantities on which external boundary conditions are imposed .",
    "the confinement of quantum mechanical vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field causes long - ranged forces between two conducting uncharged plates which is known as the ( quantum mechanical ) casimir effect @xcite .",
    "the corresponding force between the plates is called the casimir force . in this form",
    "the phenomenon was predicted in 1948 @xcite by the dutch physicist hendrick casimir .",
    "the confinement of critical fluctuations of an order parameter also induces long - ranged forces between the system boundaries @xcite .",
    "this is known as the statistical - mechanical ( thermodynamic ) casimir effect . in this form",
    "the effect was discussed by fisher and de gennes @xcite already in 1978 .",
    "casimir forces arise from the influence of one portion of a system , via fluctuations , on another portion some distance away .",
    "the best known example of a casimir force is the van der waals interaction between neutral molecules . in this case",
    "the correlations between fluctuations are mediated by photons , i.e. , massless excitations of the electromagnetic field .",
    "when the system is a thermodynamic one , important examples of such massless excitations include goldstone bosons and order parameter fluctuations at critical points .",
    "the quantum mechanical casimir effect has been experimentally verified with impressive experimental precision @xcite ( see also refs.@xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "one uses atomic force microscope techniques and measures the force between a metallized sphere and a plate .",
    "since it turns out to be very difficult to keep two plates parallel with the required accuracy , there is only one recent experiment @xcite in which the original theoretical parallel plate set - up as studied by casimir was used . in this experiment",
    "it has been found that the measured casimir force agrees with the predicted one within @xmath3 accuracy .",
    "it is interesting to note that at distances of the order of 10 nm between the plates the force produces a pressure of the order of 1 atmosphere .",
    "therefore , the casimir effect is considered to be very important for the design of nanoscale devices ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite and references therein ) .    in statistical mechanics",
    "the casimir force is usually characterized by the excess free energy coming from the _ finite - size contributions _ to the free energy of the system . the parallel plate or film geometry turns out to be of great practical importance for experimental setups .    a useful model for the investigation of generic finite - size effects is given by an @xmath4-symmetric spin system ( @xmath5 ) confined to a film geometry ( @xmath6 ) with periodic boundary conditions @xmath7",
    ". models of this sort serve as theoretical descriptions of magnets or fluids confined between two parallel plates of infinite area .",

    "the thermodynamic casimir force is a generalized force conjugate to the distance @xmath1 between the boundaries of the system with the property @xmath14 for @xmath15 .",

    "limit finite size scaling theory is applicable .",
    "the _ sign _ of the casimir force is of particular interest .",

    "this implies an attractive force between the walls for large separations .",
    "when the boundary conditions _ differ _ between the confining surfaces , the casimir force is expected to be _ repulsive _ @xcite .",
    "the current experimental situation will be discussed later in the article .",
    "here we only mention that these experiments are in qualitative and in some cases even in quantitative agreement .    in this article",
    "we discuss the behavior of the thermodynamic casimir force in systems with short - ranged and with subleading long - ranged ( dispersion ) forces , which are present , e.g. , in real fluids .",
    "both interactions lead to the same universality class , provided that the dimensionality @xmath21 of the system and the symmetry of the ordered state are the same .",
    "despite this similarity we will see that , in comparison with systems with short - ranged forces , new important finite - size contributions exist in systems with dispersion forces .",
    "we shall also discuss proper boundary conditions for systems with subleading long - ranged interactions and ww shall reconsider several recent statements @xcite for the behavior of the finite - size free energy and the casimir force in systems with short - ranged interactions and with dispersion forces .    from the definition in eqs.([def ] ) and ( [ fexd ] ) it is clear that one needs to know the critical behavior of the free energy in a slab geometry in order to derive the behavior of the casimir force . based on numerous investigations it has turned out that the thermodynamic behavior of a system near a second order phase transition exhibits scale invariance and universality @xcite . in order to set the stage for our considerations we first recall certain bulk properties .",

    "boundary conditions .",
    "however , dirichlet boundary conditions are inconsistent with the long - ranged nature of the dispersion forces ( subleading long - ranged interaction ) , because the `` missing neighbors '' of the ordering degrees of freedom at a surface of such a system by the nature of long - ranged interactions generate a long - ranged surface field .",
    "we therefore conclude that the consideration of systems with subleading long - range interactions combined with dirichlet boundary conditions as proposed in ref.@xcite is of no physical relevance . in the next section",
    "we summarize our findings and also comment on the proper boundary conditions and the expected finite - size behavior of systems with dispersion forces and real boundaries .",
    "we will present arguments as to why we expect this to differ significantly from eq.([feslr ] ) .",
    "it has been shown in sects .",
    "ii and iii that nonanalyticities in the dispersion relation @xmath138 at the momentum cutoff lead to a bulk model which has leading and competing long - ranged interactions in real space .",
    "thus even in the bulk it has peculiar properties such as the two - point correlation function given by eq.([ccd ] ) .",
    "for such a model finite - size scaling developed for systems with short - ranged or subleading long - ranged interactions does not apply from the outset .",

    "divergent momentum integrals can be regularized by the introduction of a cutoff which is motivated by the presence of a brillouin zone ( lattice models ) or finite particle sizes ( continuum models ) . if a sharp cutoff in momentum space is applied as a _ strict _ feature of an otherwise approximate ( expanded ) dispersion relation , the ensuing nonanalyticity of @xmath138 at the cutoff generates long - ranged correlations and finite - size effects of the order @xmath108 .",
    "these effects do not occur in actual systems with short - ranged or subleading long - ranged interactions and therefore they are artificial . in particular , the nonuniversal long - ranged casimir forces reported in ref .",
    "@xcite have no physical relevance for systems with short - ranged forces .",
    "it is instructive to consider the finite - size behavior of the free energy in systems with subleading long - ranged interactions .",
    "as is well known , the free energy decomposes into a sum of a regular and a singular part . in section iii",
    "we have discussed the finite - size behavior of the singular part for the case of periodic boundary conditions in a film geometry .",
    "however , the regular part is also important and it has experimental consequences for the casimir force . for periodic boundary conditions",
    "one expects the regular part to be of the order @xmath189 in the vicinity of @xmath72 .",
    "much more interesting is the case of a system with real boundaries .",
    "this raises the question of proper boundary conditions for such systems",
    ". they can not be boundary conditions of the dirichlet or neumann type , because the latter are incompatible with the long - ranged nature of the interactions .",
    "instead , one finds that long - ranged interactions generate long - ranged _ surface fields _ which decay according to a power law away from the surface into the bulk of the system .",
    "the direct ( hamaker ) interaction of the surfaces then generates a @xmath249 contribution to the regular part of the free energy if the free energy is measured per unit volume ( or a @xmath250 contribution if the free energy is measured per unit area ) .",
    "this is well known from studies of , e.g. , wetting phenomena @xcite .",
    "the contribution to the regular part of the free energy due to the action of the surface fields on the ordering degrees of freedom is also of the order of @xmath249 .",
    "the available renormalization group arguments suggest that the contribution to the singular part should be of the order @xmath251 @xcite .",
    "this leads to the following _ hypothesis for the singular part of the free energy _ :",
    "@xmath252 where @xmath253 is a nonuniversal metric factor characterizing the long - ranged behavior of the surface fields , while @xmath254 is the corresponding factor at the surface boundaries . here",
    "@xmath255 is the critical surface gap exponent of the corresponding surface universality class .",
    "note that , since @xmath198 , the term proportional to @xmath253 will give contributions that are _ larger _ than that proportional to @xmath209 , i.e. , the contributions of the surface fields are important and can not be ignored .",
    "in particular , this is important for the quantitave analysis of wetting experiments with critical binary liquid mixtures @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of these experimental data @xcite is still unresolved .",
    "we also point out , that neither eq.([feslr ] ) nor eq.([hypoffss ] ) applies to confined superfluid @xmath256he or @xmath257he-@xmath256he mixtures @xcite which have been under investigation in recent experiments @xcite .",
    "for superfluid @xmath256he the long - ranged finite - size contributions to the free energy originate from two distinct sources : ( i ) a _ regular _ contribution from the dispersion forces which couple to the fluid _ density _ and which are unrelated to the superfluid order parameter , ( ii ) a _ singular _ contribution from the superfluid order parameter which is generically short - ranged in nature and does not relate to the presence of dispersion forces @xcite .",
    "the situation is more complicated in the case of @xmath257he-@xmath256he mixtures , where the superfluid transition temperature depends on the @xmath257he concentration , which eventually causes the superfluid transition to become first order beyond the tricritical @xmath257he concentration .",
    "the @xmath257he concentration does respond to dispersion forces and , by virtue of long - ranged surface fields , long - ranged @xmath257he concentration perturbations may emerge in a confined @xmath257he-@xmath256he mixture . through the dependence of the superfluid transition temperature @xmath258 on the @xmath257he concentration a long - ranged variation of the local value of @xmath258 will ensue which in turn imposes a corresponding variation of the superfluid density in thermal equilibrium . from the experiment in ref.@xcite",
    "there is robust evidence that dirichlet boundary conditions do not apply for the superfluid order parameter of @xmath257he-@xmath256he in the tricritical regime , because contrary to the case of pure @xmath256he @xcite a thickening of the wetting layer has been observed caused by a _ repulsive _ tricritical casimir force .",
    "this observation rules out pure dirichlet boundary conditions in this case , because these can only account for _ attractive _ casimir forces as observed in pure @xmath256he @xcite .",
    "furthermore , subdominant long - ranged interactions may play a significant role in a finite - size scaling analysis of @xmath257he-@xmath256he mixtures in the vicinity of the bulk superfluid transition .",
    "however , the model hamiltonian of the system then has to accomodate a second noncritical field ( the @xmath257he concentration ) apart from the superfluid order parameter in order to include dispersion forces and long - ranged surface fields in the physically correct way .",
    "the construction of a proper model hamiltonian , which is a generalization of the standard ginzburg - landau hamiltonian considered here , is beyond the scope of this work .    in conclusion , we remark that we still lack a complete theoretical description of the casimir effect in systems with subleading long - ranged interactions",
    ". such a description must contain both the influence of surface fields and the long - ranged nature of the interaction potential .",
    "both are expected to generate important contributions to the critical behavior pertaining to the universality class of systems with short - ranged interaction potentials . very close to @xmath72 the finite - size behavior",
    "should turn out to be that of short - ranged models , but additional finite - size effects are expected to become dominant for @xmath259 . for systems with scalar order parameter these expectations hold both above and below the bulk critical temperature . for @xmath4 models",
    "one expects that goldstone modes will dominate the finite - size behavior of the systems below @xmath72 .",
