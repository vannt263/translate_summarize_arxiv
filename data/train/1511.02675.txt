    "fe - based materials - pnictides and chalcogenides - represent a new class of unconventional superconductors with high transition temperatures  @xcite .",
    "while the mechanism of superconductivity is still a mystery , the main candidates are spin or orbital fluctuations . except for the extreme hole and electron dopings ,",
    "the fermi surface consists of two or three hole pockets around the @xmath3 point and two electron pockets around the @xmath4 point in the 2-fe brillouin zone .",
    "scattering between them with the large wave vector results in the enhanced antiferromagnetic fluctuations , which promote the @xmath0 type of the superconducting order parameter that change sign between electron and hole pockets  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "bands near the fermi level have mixed orbital content and orbital fluctuations enhanced by the electron - phonon interaction may lead to the sign - preserving @xmath1 state  @xcite",
    ". however , most experimental data including observation of a spin - resonance peak in inelastic neutron scattering , the quasiparticle interference in tunneling experiments , and nmr spin - lattice relaxation rate are in favor of the @xmath0 scenario  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 states are expected to behave differently subject to the disorder  @xcite . in general , @xmath1 ( @xmath0 ) state should be stable ( fragile ) against a scattering on a nonmagnetic impurities  @xcite .",
    "detailed studies revealed that @xmath2 stays finite in the presence of nonmagnetic disorder in the following cases : i ) @xmath1 state  @xcite , ii ) @xmath5 transition for the sizeable intraband attraction in the two - band @xmath0 model in the strong - coupling @xmath6-matrix approximation  @xcite and via the numerical solutions of the bogoliubov - de gennes equations  @xcite , iii ) an unitary limit  @xcite .",
    "magnetic impurities leave @xmath2 finite  @xcite in the case of 1 ) @xmath0 superconductor with the purely interband impurity scattering , 2 ) @xmath1 state with the purely interband scattering due to the @xmath7 transition , and 3 ) the unitary limit for both @xmath1 and @xmath0 states independent on the exact form of the impurity potential .",
    "but even if @xmath2 is suppressed , its behavior may differ from the abrikosov - gorkov ( ag ) theory for the single - band superconductors  @xcite , which states that @xmath2 is determined by the expression @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the digamma function , @xmath10 is the impurity scattering rate , and @xmath11 is the critical temperature in the absence of impurities  @xcite .",
    "the choice of the `` proper '' theory for disorder effects in iron - based materials is severely complicated by the fact that the exact form of the impurity potential is not known .",
    "in such a situation it is instructive to theoretically explore as many situations as possible . here",
    "we focus on a special case of a uniform impurity potential with equal intra- and interband components .",
    "we consider two - band models for the isotropic @xmath0 and @xmath1 superconductors with either nonmagnetic or magnetic impurities within the self - consistent @xmath6-matrix approximation following approach from refs .  @xcite .",

    "n , ^_(n - n ) , [ eq.deltan1 ] the coupling functions @xmath35 depend on the normalized bosonic spectral function @xmath36 used in refs .  @xcite . while the matrix elements @xmath37 can be positive ( attractive ) as well as negative ( repulsive ) due to the interplay between spin fluctuations and electron - phonon coupling  @xcite , the matrix elements @xmath38 are always positive . for simplicity we set @xmath39 and neglect possible @xmath23-space anisotropy in each order parameter @xmath40 .",
    "we use the @xmath6-matrix approximation to calculate the average impurity self - energy @xmath41 : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the impurity concentration .",
    "first , we consider nonmagnetic disorder .",
    "impurity potential matrix entering equation  ( [ eq.tmatrix ] ) is defined as @xmath44 , where @xmath45 with @xmath46 is the impurity site . for simplicity , we set intra- and interband parts of the potential equal to @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively , so that @xmath49 .",
    "relation between the two will be controlled by the parameter @xmath50 : @xmath51 .",
    "apart from the general case , later we are going to examine the two important limiting cases : born limit ( weak scattering ) with @xmath52 and the opposite case of a very strong impurity scattering ( unitary limit ) with @xmath53 .",

    "obviously , for the finite interband scattering @xmath63 ( i.e. finite @xmath50 ) different bands are mixed in equations .",

    "again , different bands are mixed so we have a suppression of @xmath2 .",
    "all other cases with @xmath69 : @xmath70 we get the same result , as for the intraband impurities since the other band ( @xmath18 ) does not contribute to the equations . surprisingly , but here the anderson theorem works independent of the gap signs in different bands .",
    "thus , @xmath2 should be finite for arbitrary impurity concentration .    here",
    "we conclude , that there is a special case of @xmath2 suppression in the unitary limit for the uniform impurity potential @xmath66 .",
