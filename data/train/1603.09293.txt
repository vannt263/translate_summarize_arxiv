    "charged capillary nanopores , or nanotubes , allow for combined water and ion transport , and have applications in desalination and energy conversion  @xcite .",

    "the mathematical theory combines the navier - stokes , nernst - planck and poisson equations  @xcite . for pores that are much longer",
    "than wide , osterle and co - workers   introduced the capillary pore model , or space charge ( sc ) theory , which is based on assuming chemical and mechanical equilibrium in the direction transverse to flow , i.e. , in the @xmath0-direction in a cylindrical geometry . using this simplification , calculation of transport in the flow direction",
    "can be discoupled from solution of the poisson - boltzmann equation in @xmath0-direction .",
    "this theory has been shown to accurately predict ion fluxes and fluid flow , not only in track - etched pores and highly ordered structures , but also in materials such as ion - selective membranes that are characterized by a much lower degree of order  .",
    "based on the sc theory , further simplifications can be made by assuming a homogenized potential and concentration in @xmath0-direction ( `` uniform potential''-model ) , and/or by neglecting concentration gradients in axial direction  .",
    "one outstanding question in the description of flow through nanopores and nanotubes is the relevance of fluid slip at pore walls , expressed mathematically as the slip length ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_schem ] ) .",
    "this slip length is an inverse measure of the friction between water and pore wall . for non - wetting fluids transported through ( carbon ) nanotubes ( cnts ) ,",
    "very high slip lengths are reported , up to order of 1 @xmath1 m and larger  @xcite , implying that fluid can flow almost without friction through cnts .    in the case of slippage on hydrophilic surfaces",
    "limited experimental work has been reported , which most probably is the result of the difficulties associated with its experimental determination . for hydrophilic surfaces",
    "the slip length is orders of magnitude lower than for hydrophobic surfaces . for hydrophobic materials ,",
    "slip lengths have been reported up to hundreds of nanometers , for instance for oxygen plasma - treated pdms surfaces  @xcite . instead",
    ", for charged pores or tubes , and with water as electrolyte , the slip length is assumed to be much smaller  @xcite . in any event , regardless of the nature of the surface , the presence of slip on the pore walls can have drastic effects in micro- and nanofluidic systems in a variety of processes : e.g. , transport of particles in solution  @xcite , enhanced heat transfer  @xcite , and electrokinetic processes  . here",
    "we will show that even a slip length of the order of 1 nm can significantly modify key parameters relevant for performance of membranes containing charged nanopores , either for energy harvesting , energy conversion or desalination .     in a nanopore with and without slip .",
    "in this example , the pore is negatively charged and connects two reservoirs at the same salt concentration @xmath2 .",
    "the slip length is approximately @xmath3 .",
    "anion and cation concentrations in the pore are denoted with red and blue colors . ]    for planar slits , fluid wall slip was described by ren and stein  , while pressure - driven electrokinetic flow was analyzed for asymmetric zeta potentials   and for fluids with non - newtonian viscoelastic properties  .",
    "recently , rankin and huang analyzed the sc theory for capillary ( cylindrical ) pores including fluid wall slip  @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we modify the capillary pore model of osterle and co - workers to include fluid wall slip .",
    "we will consider both the case of fixed wall charge , as well as wall charge that responds via a surface ionization equilibrium to the local electric potential .",
    "we will present results for alumina pores , but the results have general validity for other charged porous membranes as well .",
    "in the present manuscript , we solve the capillary pore model for situations that the salt concentration is equal on both sides of the pore , and thus leave out as driving force a concentration difference across the membrane .",
    "( note that this simplifying assumption may not be exactly correct : even with an overall zero concentration difference across the pore , the ( virtual ) concentration can still change through the pore , with only the values at either pore end fixed at the same value . )",
    "this simplifies the sc theory significantly because we do not need to consider axial gradients in concentration , chemical potential , or osmotic pressure , all being zero .",
    "we can also replace `` virtual '' concentration @xmath4 from ref .",
    "@xcite by @xmath2 , which is the salt concentration in the external bath .",
    "the virtual total pressure @xmath5 can be replaced by hydrostatic pressure @xmath6 because there are no gradients in the osmotic pressure .",
    "the derivation of the capillary pore model , or space charge ( sc ) theory , closely resembles that of osterle and co - workers , and is also discussed in refs .  .",
    "central to the sc - theory are the navier - stokes ( ns ) equation including local ionic charge , the nernst - planck ( np ) equation including ion advection , and the poisson - boltzmann ( pb ) equation solved in radial direction . for the development of these equations ,",

    "[ fig](a , b ) shows this expectation to be correct .",

    "we showed that the presence of even moderate slip on the pore walls of the nanoscopic capillary , with a slip length of the order of 1 nm , results in significant enhancements of the streaming and ionic conductances .",
    "this in turn positively affects @xmath54 . for the maximum in @xmath54 , which is achieved at a relatively low wall charge for both the no - slip and with - slip cases",
    ", we found a 4-fold increase in @xmath54 when slip is included .",
    "we also showed that a further increase in @xmath54 can be achieved by selecting coions and counterions with high and low diffusion coefficient , respectively .",
    "the capillary pore model was combined with the langmuir - stern isotherm to represent ionizable surfaces .",
    "it could be concluded that similar to the case of a fixed charge , slip increases @xmath54 significantly .",
    "additionally , the presence of ionizable surfaces resulted in a non - monotonic dependence of streaming conductance and ionic conductance on salt concentration .",
