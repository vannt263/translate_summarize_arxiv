    "what is the entropy of a gravitational field ? following the insights of hawking and bekenstein @xcite , an answer has been only been provided for a subset of situations characterised by static and stationary spacetimes with event horizons . in particular , black holes are found to be black bodies .",
    "they possess a well - defined entropy .",
    "they obey the laws of equilibrium thermodynamics and , when perturbed , their fluctuations obey the laws of close - to - equilibrium thermodynamics @xcite . yet , despite these developments it remains an unsolved problem whether an analogous gravitational entropy can be defined for non - stationary spacetimes of the sort that characterise most relativistic cosmologies that are considered as models for the past , present , and future of our visible universe .",
    "unfortunately , a solution of this problem appears to involve the solution of a number of separate hard problems in gravitation physics .",
    "it requires a rigorous measure of the probability of different cosmological initial conditions to be found .",
    "it also requires us to be sure that we have accounted for all the possible contributions to the gravitational entropy : there may be quantum , classical , geometrical , topological , thermal , and dynamical contributions that need to be quantified and added @xcite .",
    "the nature of the states of zero and maximum entropy also need to be defined and the influence of possible events like inflation must be fully accounted for entropically , and all must be suitably coordinate covariant .",
    "it has also been argued @xcite that the whole concept of the arrow of time and thermodynamics relies upon the concept of a gravitational entropy , and hence leads all the way back to fundamental questions about the origin of time and the nature of the initial state of the universe .",
    "gravitation has a tendency to amplify small inhomogeneities in the distribution of matter . yet ,",
    "our present observations of the spectrum and temperature isotropy of the microwave background radiation show that the radiation was very close to thermal equilibrium when it was last  scattered , and that fluctuations from the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) spacetime metric are only of order @xmath1 .",
    "if there does exist a gravitational entropy that grows with time to reflect the action of gravitational instability then it should have the property that it vanishes ( or at least is small ) for a homogeneous and isotropic metric and be maximal for a black hole of the same total mass .",
    "this type of observation has led some investigators to propose that any measure of cosmological gravitational entropy should be proportional to the deviation of the universe from the frw model @xcite .",
    "hence , the present gravitational entropy of the universe is in some sense small and so must have been even smaller in the past , perhaps providing some rationale for assuming the initial state of the universe to have zero entropy and hence be frw up to minimal quantum gravitational fluctuations .    based on this observation",
    ", penrose @xcite suggested that the weyl curvature invariant , given by @xmath2 should be very small near the initial singularity , and then grow thereafter behaving as a proper measure of the gravitational entropy .",
    "this in all its editions , is what we will call the _ weyl curvature conjecture _ ( wcc ) .",
    "wainwright and anderson @xcite had a different version of the wcc .",
    "they expressed the conjecture in terms of the relative magnitude of the weyl and ricci curvature invariants : @xmath3 however , based on observations from two different universe models and taking into account that the entropy should scale with the volume , grn and hervik @xcite , @xcite suggested that a better measure of a gravitational entropy would be @xmath4 most other studies of the wcc @xcite use the square of the weyl scalar , @xmath5 or @xmath6 as the putative gravitational entropy for cosmological models .",
    "however , these candidates do not scale as the volume and so they do not capture correctly the dependence of a weyl entropy on the volume .",
    "we introduce the expansion - normalised shear : @xmath7 the shear tensor is a symmetric and trace - free tensor defined by @xmath8 here , @xmath9 is the normalised four - velocity of the comoving fluid ; @xmath10 is the expansion tensor of the comoving fluid and @xmath11 the volume expansion rate .",
    "the shear tensor tells us how anisotropic the universe is ; in particular , @xmath12 if and only if the universe is isotropic . from the generalised friedmann equation ( @xmath13 ) 13 ^ 2=12^_-12^(3)r++ .",
    "[ friedmann]since the density , @xmath14 , is positive , @xmath15 will be bounded by @xmath16 whenever the spatial ricci - scalar is non - positive : @xmath17 .",
    "this inequality will be fulfilled in all of the homogeneous models , except in the type ix and the kantowski - sachs closed universes .",
    "one of the aims of this paper will be to investigate the quantity @xmath18 for all homogeneous models , and determine whether or not it has the appropriate behaviour for a gravitational entropy .",
    "hence , we will try to determine whether or not @xmath18 increases during the evolution of all homogeneous universes .",
    "we will also investigate the quantity @xmath19 , because this quantity tells us something of the physical properties of the universe model under consideration and the general properties of the evolution of anisotropic universes .",
    "we will discuss , unless stated otherwise , only spatially homogeneous cosmologies with a non - tilted @xmath0-law perfect fluid .",
    "we also assume that the matter sources obey the strong energy condition ; the effects from inflationary fluids are considered elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we will investigate all the possible spatially homogeneous models .",
    "of special interest are the eight thurston geometries @xcite which are related to the classification of topologies in three dimensions @xcite .",
    "these models correspond to the bianchi types in a rather interesting way @xcite .",
    "the possibility of compactification of these thurston models has induced a renewed interest in the homogeneous models of thurston and bianchi type @xcite .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section [ frw ]",
    "we investigate all the models that have the frw models as a special case .",
    "the remaining thurston models are investigated in section [ thurston ] , and in section [ nonthurston ] we investigate the remaining bianchi models of non - thurston type .",
    "we summarise our results in the final section . _  _",
    "first , we will consider models which contain the frw universes as special cases .",
    "the spatial sections in these cases are either @xmath20 or @xmath21 . in the isotropic case",
    "these correspond to the bianchi types i and vii@xmath22 v and vii@xmath23 , and ix , which contain the @xmath24 and @xmath25 frw universes respectively .      for the flat case , @xmath27 , we have already exhaustively examined the bianchi type i models in earlier papers @xcite .",
    "an important class of solutions is provided by the kasner vacuum solutions : @xmath28 the exponents obey @xmath29 .",
    "the solution space of these solutions is a circle , and are usually referred to as the _ kasner circle_. if @xmath30 , then the line element is taub s form of flat spacetime .",
    "this form of flat spacetime will be referred to as @xmath31 , and lies on the kasner circle .",
    "note that @xmath31 is one of two locally rotationally symmetric ( lrs ) spacetimes on the kasner circle .",
    "all vacuum kasner solutions have maximal expansion - normalised shear : @xmath32    we will assume a perfect fluid with equation of state linking the pressure @xmath33 and density @xmath34 @xmath35 for all @xmath36 it can be shown that the kasner circle is a past attractor , can be viewed as a @xmath37 fluid in the friedmann equation ( [ friedmann ] ) . hence , if the model contains a perfect fluid with @xmath36 , the shear will dominate the initial singularity .",
    "this need not to be the case when @xmath37 . ] . calculating the weyl tensor",
    ", we find that near the initial singularity @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the cosmological time .",
    "the quantities @xmath19 and @xmath18 defined in eqs .",
    "( [ weyl1 ] ) and ( [ s ] ) , can be shown to behave as ( assuming a kasner - like behaviour ) @xmath40 to leading order near the initial singularity .",
    "we note that @xmath19 will diverge near the initial singularity for all @xmath36 ; @xmath18 will approach zero for @xmath41 and diverge for @xmath42 .",
    "if a fluid with @xmath43 is assumed to dominate near the initial singularity then @xmath18 will increase as @xmath44 .",
    "radiation fluids will dominate the early history of our universe so long as particle interaction and scattering times are shorter than the expansion time",
    ". this may not be the case for asymptotically - free interactions between @xmath45 but is likely to be restored ( subject to boundary effects on the long - wavelength part of the momentum distribution due to finite horizon effects and the breakdown of statistical mechanics ) on approach to the planck scale .",
    "also , it is most likely that any self - interacting scalar fields present will become dominated by their kinetic energies as @xmath44 .",
    "this is equivalent to domination by a @xmath46 fluid .",
    "thus an effective @xmath41 in the neighbourhood of the initial singularity , is quite probable .",
    "it might not be the case if the potential energy of a scalar field dominated or scaled in proportion to its kinetic energy as @xmath44 .",
    "an example of the latter type is provided by a scalar field @xmath47 with an exponential potential @xmath48.$ ]    we see that for the point @xmath31 on the kasner circle , we have @xmath49 near the initial singularity .",
    "when we include a matter source with anisotropic pressure created by photons or asymptotically - free particles in an anisotropic universe ( since they are expected to be collisionless significantly below the planck temperature ) or a cosmic magnetic field , the behaviour near the initial singularity turns out to be quite complex .",
    "the behaviour of a bianchi type i model with a magnetic field @xcite or yang - mills field @xcite is _",
    "chaotic_. similar behaviour are found in bianchi type ix and viii . in the types",
    "viii and ix , curvature effects cause the universe to `` bounce '' between different kasner states ; the magnetic field in the type i case , tends to mimic this effect .",
    "the bianchi type i with pure magnetic field was investigated using the dynamical systems approach in @xcite .",
    "when the universe is in a kasner epoch , the weyl curvature invariant behaves as in the kasner universe .",
    "the question to consider is : what happens to the weyl curvature invariants during the bounces ?",
    "as we approach the initial singularity , the duration of the bounces will become negligible compared to the duration of the kasner epochs in between the bounces .",
    "we can write the weyl curvature invariant as @xcite @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the dimensionless weyl curvature invariant , and @xmath52 is the hubble factor .",
    "the quantity @xmath53 can be written so that it is only a polynomial ( of degree 4 ) in the state space variables .",
    "the state space for bianchi type i with a magnetic field is compact , and hence , all the variables are bounded and @xmath53 must therefore also be bounded _",
    "at all times_. similarly , @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a positive definite polynomial of the bounded state - space variables .",
    "when the universe is in a kasner epoch , @xmath56 will vary as @xmath57 where @xmath58 is an angular variable on the kasner circle .",
    "the first mode @xmath59 comes from the perfect fluid term , while @xmath60 comes from the energy density of the magnetic field .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath19 during these periods will therefore vary according to the value of the kasner parameter @xmath58 .",
    "the quantity @xmath18 will behave as @xmath61 during the kasner epochs .",
    "if @xmath41 this quantity will be increasing during this period . if @xmath42 there will be kasner epochs where @xmath18 will decrease , and others where it will increase . on `` average '' , assuming that all the kasner epochs occur with equal probability , the quantity @xmath18 will increase . during a bounce ,",
    "the magnetic field will experience a sharp peak in its energy density .",
    "this makes @xmath56 experience a peak as well .",
    "hence , during this bounce , the quantity @xmath18 will fall for a brief period , until it rises to a new kasner level again .",
    "thus , during kasner oscillations , @xmath18 will both decrease and increase in time .",
    "however , on average , @xmath18 will increase continuously during these oscillations .",
    "the bianchi type vii@xmath62 universe model , the other bianchi model which is compatible with @xmath63 spatial sections , has further interesting properties .",
    "for example , if @xmath64 the solutions of this model will at late times isotropise in terms of the shear , but not isotropise with respect to the weyl tensor @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that if @xmath65 _ vii_0 & & 0 while for @xmath66 the shear will oscillate as @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "the weyl tensor has a quite complicated behaviour ; if @xmath68 then @xmath69 will oscillate with larger and larger amplitudes .",
    "the oscillations will diverge at late times in the sense that differently from that defined here .",
    "this makes their parameter increase monotonically at late times , while ours will oscillate . ]",
    "|w^2|= this happens because the universe at late times will oscillate around an isotropic state . as the universe expands , the amplitude of the oscillations will be smaller and smaller , and hence , will isotropise with respect to the shear .",
    "but the oscillations will become more and more rapid while @xmath69 increases beyond bound @xcite .",
    "the scalar @xmath51 measures the absolute value of weyl curvature , while the quantity @xmath19 measure the ratio of the `` matter curvature '' to the weyl curvature . strictly speaking , the measure @xmath19 will oscillate as the quantity @xmath51 does , _ _  _ _ but we can avoid this by either adopting the definition of the weyl parameter as in @xcite , or we can take the absolute value of @xmath53 and thereafter average over a complete period .",
    "we will do the latter , and denote these entities with a bar , for example @xmath70 . in the case of vii@xmath71",
    "we then get @xmath72 so in this case , even the `` @xmath19-version '' of the wcc holds . since the universe is ever expanding ,",
    "@xmath18 will diverge at late times as well , as @xmath73      we will now consider the @xmath75 cases .",
    "they  have @xmath76 the future asymptotics for these models are more easily obtained because they approach vacuum solutions in the future .",
    "all of the type v and vii@xmath77 solutions will , assuming that the matter content obeys the strong energy condition , evolve asymptotically towards plane - wave spacetimes @xcite . for plane waves ,",
    "all the curvature scalars are zero even though the metrics are anisotropic . in general",
    ", these open universe solutions will not have a zero weyl tensor ( except for a set of zero measure which correspond to the isotropic vacuum milne universes ) .",
    "however , the late - time behaviour of vii@xmath23 models is to approach particular exact solutions first found by lukash @xcite which are plane waves @xcite .",
    "lukash vacuum solution found by lukash @xcite and a @xmath46 stiff fluid solution by barrow @xcite . ]",
    "this behaviour indicates that the evolution of the weyl scalar and @xmath18 in this case is more subtle as we approach the future asymptote .",
    "the weyl scalars will tend to zero even though the anisotropy freezes in with @xmath78 approaching a constant value .",
    "clearly , the weyl scalar can not capture the anisotropic plane - wave modes of the gravitational field .",
    "this can be considered as an objection to the argument that it is some function of the weyl scalar which is the proper measure for the entropy .",
    "we need a more discriminating measure for the gravitational entropy , if it exists .",
    "it might also happen that these plane - wave spacetimes are isentropic modes corresponding to adiabatic perturbations of the gravitational field but we would need to know whether they are extendible into hermitian modes of a quantum cosmology .    in the v and vii@xmath23 cases containing a perfect fluid , part of the kasner circle will be a past attractor for all equation of state parameters @xmath36 .",
    "hence , the discussion for the type i model near the initial singularity also applies to these models .",
    "as we already have mentioned , the future attractor is a lukash plane - wave solution with @xmath79 if @xmath80 and the open frw model with @xmath12 if @xmath81 . using the exact solutions in the type v model with perfect fluid ( see @xcite )",
    ", we can show that when @xmath82 the late - time behaviour for these solutions has a weyl curvature invariant evolution ( c^c _ ) _ v = t^-4 .",
    "[ eq : weylv]the first of these terms comes from pure shear term effects in the absence of matter .",
    "the second term is driven by the matter interactions . in the presence of a perfect fluid",
    ", the pure shear term will always be sub - dominant for @xmath83 . under the assumption @xmath84 at late times we have @xmath85 even though this is derived from the exact solution of type v , one can show that eqs.([eq : weylv ] ) and ( [ eq : psv ] ) will also hold in the generic case ( see appendix a ) ; the expression for weyl curvature invariant in the type v case is remarkable simple .",
    "thus , in the type v case , @xmath19 is always decreasing and @xmath18 is always increasing .",
    "note also that this increase is due to the anisotropic modes ; we assumed the universe to be homogeneous .",
    "the case vii@xmath23 is more difficult .",
    "investigations by barrow and sonoda @xcite , and later by hewitt and wainwright @xcite indicate that if @xmath86 then the generic solution asymptotes a plane - wave solution at late times .",
    "the plane - wave solutions have @xmath87 and zero weyl curvature invariant .",
    "the approach to the plane - wave asymptote , is subtle and a careful investigation of the weyl curvature invariant in a neighbourhood of the plane - wave solutions is needed .",
    "the investigation and calculation is somewhat tedious , but the result is rather interesting : ( c^c _ ) _ vii_ht^-4 .",
    "[ eq : weylvii](see appendix a on the nature of these asymptotes ) . here",
    ", @xmath88 is a constant parameter which tells us which plane - wave solution is approached as @xmath89 and @xmath88 obeys the inequality @xmath90 the shear is related to @xmath88 for these plane - wave solutions via the simple relation @xmath91 note the appearance of the shear - to - volume expansion rate parameter in the power of time rather than as an additive perturbation .",
    "this is a signal of the stability of the isotopic solution being decided at second ( or higher ) order because the lukash plane - waves are exact solutions of both the einstein equations and the linearised einstein equations .",
    "thus a linearisation of the einstein equations about the lukash solution gives a zero eigenvalue @xcite .",
    "which of the two terms that in eq .",
    "( [ eq : weylvii ] ) is dominant depends on the parameters @xmath88 and @xmath0 .",
    "the ricci scalar squared will in general decay as @xmath92 hence , @xmath93 and the volume expands as @xmath94 , so @xmath18 will increase as @xmath95 note that both @xmath19 and @xmath18 @xmath96 as @xmath97 .",
    "both the weyl invariant and the ricci invariants approach zero , but the weyl invariant does so at a slower rate than the ricci invariant .",
    "ricci has @xmath98 , while the weyl tensor contains shear modes as well .",
    "the work of collins and hawking @xcite is of relevance here .",
    "this was a study of the stability of isotropic ever - expanding universes against spatially homogeneous perturbations of bianchi type vii@xmath99 and was not restricted to perfect fluids and comoving fluids . in the case of vii@xmath23 perturbations to open frw  universes , isotropy was shown to be unstable . however , this well known result requires careful interpretation .",
    "the definition of stability used was asymptotic stability in the sense of lyapunov ; that is , as @xmath100 we need to have @xmath101 however , in general we have found that these vii@xmath23 perturbations of the open frw universe approach the lukash plane - wave spacetimes which have @xmath102 constant ( @xmath103 is forbidden by @xmath104 ) .",
    "thus although isotropy is not asymptotically stable it is stable in the sense that the deviations from isotropy ( @xmath12 ) are always bounded @xcite .",
    "note that the strong theorem of collins and hawking , assuming only the strong energy condition ( @xmath105 is a reflection of the property that the matter does nt matter as @xmath100 in the open universe case .",
    "thus , the behaviour determining the asymptotic stability is that of the vacuum solution and so does not have any significant impact upon why the present anisotropy is so low ( see @xcite for a discussion of how this may be explained ) .",
    "by contrast , in the case of type vii@xmath71 perturbations around the flat frw model , the matter content of the universe is very influential and @xmath15 decays to zero as @xmath100 only if the dominant form of matter is a perfect fluid with zero pressure ( @xmath106 ) @xcite .",
    "again , this is not very relevant to the present state of the universe since in the absence of inflation the bulk of its expansion e - folds since the planck epoch have been in a radiation - dominated state for which isotropy is not stable in the collins and hawking sense .",
    "the space @xmath75 is infinite , and in the above cases we have assumed that we are dealing with an infinite and unbounded space @xmath75 .",
    "however , if we relax the assumption of _ global _ homogeneity and isotropy , we can get other spacetimes whose spatial section at each instant of time is a compact hyperbolic manifold ( chm ) .",
    "interestingly , our earlier discussion must be completely revised in the compact case .",
    "the compact hyperbolic spaces are heavily constrained by mostow s rigidity theorem ; no anisotropic deformations of chms are allowed .",
    "all the bianchi models of type v and vii@xmath77 with compact spatial sections have to be ( locally ) isotropic @xcite .",
    "hence , their weyl tensors identically vanish .",
    "is broken at the global scale when we go to its compact quotients .",
    "thus , the inhomogeneous tolman - bondi model , which we discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , must also be constrained .",
    "the matter content of the tolman - bondi models is determined by the dust - density @xmath107 . if @xmath108 is allowed to vary only as a function of the radius @xmath109 inside a spherical shell of radius @xmath110 , where @xmath110 is the coordinate _",
    "injectivity radius _ of the chm , then the compactification can be done . outside the shell of radius @xmath110 ,",
    "the density @xmath108 must be constant as a function of @xmath109 so that the homogeneity can be `` restored '' outside this shell .",
    "the same arguments as for the general tolman - bondi model can now be made , and we get a @xmath111 increase inside @xmath110 . ]    a more general investigation of the behaviour of @xmath18 for chms is dependent on a calculation of the inhomogeneous eigenmodes of the chm .",
    "this has not been done by date , but some numerical studies have been made @xcite .      turning our attention to the closed universe case , the bianchi type ix model has the possibility of chaotic dynamics .",
    "a closed universe will recollapse to a second singularity after a finite amount of proper time has elapsed if the matter obeys the strong energy condition , the positive pressure criteria , the dominant energy condition , and a matter regularity condition @xcite .",
    "there can be an asymmetry between behaviour at the initial and final singularities which reflects the relative likelihood of different initial conditions .",
    "a special initial state that is chosen close to isotropy will deviate increasingly from isotropy on approach to any final singularity and exhibit chaotic spacetime oscillations induced by the anisotropy of the three - curvature .",
    "however , a quasi - isotropic initial state can be made general by the assumption that the matter content at the initial singularity is dominated by the influence of a @xmath46 fluid or a scalar field with zero potential @xcite . in this case",
    "the difference between the quantity @xmath51 and @xmath19 is also manifest .",
    "the quantity @xmath19 is regular everywhere for the type ix case , except at the singularities .",
    "however , at the turning - point of the volume expansion @xmath113 , and so @xmath51 will diverge there .",
    "when it comes to the initial singularity , the bianchi type ix has a very peculiar behaviour .",
    "near the initial singularity it displays chaotic behaviour in vacuum and with @xmath114 perfect fluids @xcite .",
    "there is the issue of the coordinate covariance of measures of chaos to be dealt with here , but this problem can be overcome @xcite .",
    "the geometrical picture is similar to that of the magnetic bianchi type i universe which we have already discussed .",
    "the difference is in the ricci tensor and in the matter terms .",
    "the weyl curvature invariant will have the same property as in the magnetic bianchi type i case .",
    "if the universe has a perfect fluid with equation of state parameter @xmath0 then we would expect the same behaviour as in the kasner universes .",
    "hence , @xmath115 during the kasner epochs .",
    "the bounces induce downward spikes in @xmath116 , but on average we will have a steady increase of @xmath18 with time until dust domination or potential dominated scalar - field evolution ( @xmath117 effectively ) .",
    "cosmological models with spatial sections @xmath118 can be invariant under two different bianchi types , namely iii and viii . if we were to assume a type iii invariance with @xmath118 spatial sections , we would find that this is only compatible if the type iii were part of a larger symmetry group .",
    "hence , type iii can be considered as a special case of viii .",
    "let us therefore investigate models of bianchi type viii .",
    "when we compactify the spatial space , this model becomes the most generic of the ( locally ) homogeneous models .",
    "the number of free parameters can be arbitrarily large as the topology of the space increases in complexity @xcite .",
    "in addition to this , the type viii case is interesting for its dynamical behaviour as well .",
    "not only does vacuum and perfect fluid ( @xmath114 ) type viii display chaotic behaviour near the initial singularity , as in the ix case , it can also display oscillatory behaviour at late times as in the vii@xmath71 evolution @xcite .",
    "so , in this case , two rather peculiar features are manifested together , and by understanding the bianchi type viii could possibly be one of the keys for understanding the behaviour of @xmath18 and the weyl tensor in more generic models .    also the perfect fluid type viii model has a similar behaviour as the type vii@xmath71 @xcite . for @xmath119 the generic solution will approach the type iii form of flat space , but it does so in a way such that @xmath120 the shear has the asymptotic value @xmath121 in this case .",
    "thus for the type viii evolution we have @xmath122 and for @xmath119 ( actually for @xmath123 ) @xmath124 for @xmath125 , both @xmath51 and @xmath15 are finite and non - zero at late times ; the solutions asymptote to the collins type vi@xmath126 solution ( see section [ sec : vih ] ) .",
    "we refer to refs @xcite and @xcite for details .",
    "vegeometry has the bianchi lie algebra vi@xmath71 .",
    "the solutions will have the collins vi@xmath71 solution as a future attractor when @xmath80 .",
    "this solution is given by @xmath127 where @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "the shear is given explicitly by @xmath130 we can also calculate the weyl tensor for this spacetime : @xmath131 the ricci squared scalar is @xmath132 and hence , @xmath133 unfortunately , @xmath134 ( the magnetic part of the weyl curvature dominates the electric part ) for @xmath135 which makes @xmath19 imaginary .",
    "note also that @xmath136 for @xmath137 . ignoring the sign ( taking the absolute value ) we can make @xmath138 non - negative for all @xmath0 . in this case",
    ", we can define @xmath18 : @xmath139 hence , since this is a future attractor solution , the generic solution will behave similarly at late times .",
    "the generic solution starts as a special kasner solution , and thus @xmath19 and @xmath18 behave as in the bianchi type i case near the initial singularity .",
    "-geometry is invariant under the bianchi type ii group .",
    "the future attractor for generic @xmath0-law perfect fluid solutions with @xmath80 is the collins - stewart solution : @xmath140 where @xmath141 and @xmath142    the shear and the weyl curvature invariant can be readily calculated @xmath143 unfortunately , the weyl proportionality factor can be negative , positive or zero . taking the absolute value of the weyl curvature invariant we obtain @xmath144 the generic solution near the initial singularity",
    "will be approximated by a kasner solution .",
    "this model corresponds to the bianchi type iii model . in the perfect fluid case",
    ", the nature of the future attractor depends on the equation of state parameter @xmath0 . if @xmath42 , the future attractor is one of the collins perfect fluid solutions .",
    "if @xmath43 then the generic solutions are future asymptotic to the type iii plane - wave solution .",
    "note also that the type iii solutions can be considered as a special case of the vi@xmath23 solutions for @xmath146 .",
    "the vi@xmath23 universes will in general be of non - thurston type and will be considered in section [ sec : vih ] .    when @xmath43 , the solutions asymptote to a plane - wave solution and so we expect that the weyl tensor decays faster than @xmath147 .",
    "not many exact solutions are known in this case , but the lrs dust and radiation cases are known explicitly .",

    "* extreme weyl dominance . * in these models , @xmath51 @xmath96 as @xmath100 .",
    "* recollapsing models . *",
    "these models have no late - time behaviour , they recollapse after a finite time subject to the usual technical energy conditions required for recollapse @xcite .",
    ".classification of the late - time behaviour .",
    "the matter content of the universe is labelled by the perfect fluid equation of state parameter , @xmath209 ; @xmath210 indicates the presence of trace - free anisotropic stresses and type i also includes the case of a pure magnetic field .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the table [ results ] we have summarised our results , and in the rightmost column we have indicated to which of the five categories each of the spatially homogeneous models belong .",
    "we note that category-3 cosmologies are not often discussed in the literature solutions in @xcite . ] .",
    "all of the plane - wave solutions of class b belong to this category .",
    "note also that when we compactify the topology of the spatial sections @xcite , most of the models in this category disappear in the compactification procedure ; types iv and vi@xmath23 can not be compactified , type iii must be locally rotationally symmetric ( lrs ) , and vii@xmath23 must be isotropic . however , some of the type iii spacetimes ( namely those lrs with @xmath211 ) in category 3 can be compactified",
    ".    a general criterion to decide when a dynamical system will end up in category 3 can be given .",
    "if the late - time asymptote is a vacuum spacetime which is not conformally flat , but nevertheless has a zero weyl curvature invariant , then the quantity @xmath19 will generically increase without bound .",
    "if , in addition , the state space of the corresponding dynamical system is also compact , then @xmath51 has to be bounded ( and thus decreasing ) , and hence , the dynamical system will end up in category 3 .",
    "the reason for this is as follows . for a conformally flat spacetime ,",
    "both the weyl curvature invariant and the weyl tensor itself vanish .",
    "hence , any linear perturbation of this conformally flat solution will produce linear corrections to the components of the weyl tensor .",
    "since the linear terms are the lowest - order terms in the weyl tensor , quadratic terms will be the lowest - order terms in the weyl curvature invariant . for non - conformally",
    "flat spacetimes , the weyl curvature tensor will not be zero .",
    "hence , the linear terms will not be the lowest - order terms in the perturbation .",
    "thus , in the weyl curvature invariant some of the linear terms will survive even though the lowest - order ( constant ) terms could vanish identically ( which happens for the plane - wave solutions ) .",
    "the electric and the magnetic parts of the weyl tensor are not zero for plane - wave solutions , they just happen to be of equal magnitude and cancel when the invariant is formed .",
    "if the late - time asymptote is conformally flat , but not ricci flat ( hence , non - vacuum ) , then the system will typically end up in category 1 .",
    "there is also a very small chance that the spacetime will end up in category 4 if the state space is non - compact",
    ". if the asymptote is both ricci flat and conformally flat , all five categories are possible .",
    "if the state space is compact , then category 4 is ruled out .",
    "the fifth category depends to a certain extent on the geometry of the late - time attractor .",
    "for instance , inflationary spacetimes with @xmath212 , are all governed by the `` no hair '' theorem which states that the late - time asymptote is a conformally flat non - vacuum spacetime .",
    "hence , all ever - inflating cosmologies should end up in category 1 .",
    "in all of the models investigated , except for those in category 5 , @xmath18 increases at late times .",
    "hence , @xmath18 behaves as expected by the wcc .",
    "it is not clear whether we should always expect a weyl entropy to increase if the initial conditions are close to some state of effective gravitational equilibrium .",
    "of course , our study has only discussed spatially homogeneous universes and it remains to be seen whether small density and gravitational wave inhomogeneities evolve in a manner consistent with a thermodynamic interpretation of the weyl curvature and whether the inclusion of significant inhomogeneities , black holes , and damping processes introduces significant new ingredients to the search for the elusive gravitational entropy.",
    "we will briefly show how the weyl curvature invariant behaves near the plane - wave equilibrium points of type iii , v , vi@xmath23 , iv and vii@xmath23 .",
    "the discussion is based on hewitt and wainwright s approach @xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) .    for all the plane - wave solutions we will have @xmath213 , so",

    "it can be shown that the generic behaviour of the weyl curvature invariant is like this , but in some important cases it is not .",
