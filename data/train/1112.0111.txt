    "in the process of evolution nature has created perfect biomachines .",
    "researchers ( read : visionaries ) have dreamed to get ahead of nature and construct molecular - level machines which would be at the ultimate limit of miniaturization .",
    "recent development of nanofabrication technology establishes a foundation for designing , synthesizing , constructing and testing functional hybrid mechanical and electrical devices on a nanometre scale .",
    "such nanomachines , operating under different conditions , could find very many new applications .",
    "nowadays , there are many problems that have to be overcome : how to power such systems , actuate and transport them , and couple to another systems .",
    "nature prompts and provides partial solutions : within every living cell there is a service structure for its effective function and operation , transport and distribution of various products and substances inside , outside and across cells @xcite .",
    "these processes are mediated by tiny bio - motors that move along filamentous tracks .",
    "they do mechanical work consuming energy taken from the hydrolization of adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) which operates as a power station .",
    "the superfamilies of molecular bio - motors like kinesin , dynein and myosin are responsible for transport of vesicles and organelles , chromosome segregation , cell division and muscle contraction , to mention only a few .",
    "although biological , chemical and mechanical aspects have been studied , relatively little is known about the mechanisms how the biological motors work .",
    "the fundamental question is whether their movement is purely deterministic or rather random which only looks like deterministic on a macro - scale .",
    "biological motors possess many of the characteristics required to power molecular machines",
    ". they can generate force and torque , transport various cargoes and are able to operate in a processive manner , i. e. they can move continuously along the specific substrates for distances of up to hundreds of steps ( several microns ) .",
    "an example of such a motor is conventional kinesin @xcite .",
    "the two heads of the kinesin dimer work in a coordinated manner to move along one of 13 protofilament tracks of the microtubule .",
    "each protofilament consists of asymmetric @xmath0tubulin heterodimers .",
    "a heterodimer is about 8 nm long and is asymmetric because it is composed of two globular subunits : @xmath1tubulin and @xmath2tubulin which are joined together in a head  to  tail fashion so that the dimmer has a translational symmetry .",
    "because the @xmath0tubulin heterodimers are asymmetrical , the microtubule is _ polar _ and its ends are structurally different .",
    "one consequence of this polarity is that polymerization is faster at one end than the other .",
    "the fast  growing end is called the plus  end , whereas the slow  growing end is called the minus ",
    "the conventional kinesin moves towards the plus  end .",
    "there are other bio - motors like e.g. ncd dimer @xcite which move in the opposite direction on the same structure .",
    "the reason , why the motor moves in a given direction , is not explained to the end . there are several conjectures supported by analysis of very simple mechanical models .",
    "one of them says that it can depend on size of the motor , another says that it can depend on mass of the motor or more enigmatically it depends on `` molecular topology of the motor domain relative to the rest of the molecule '' @xcite .",
    "artificial molecular motors are under constructions and experiments on transport properties are performed .",
    "an example is a brownian motor by using cold atoms in a dissipative optical lattice . in experiments",
    "the optical potential is spatially symmetric and the time symmetry of the system is broken by applying appropriate zero - mean ac forces . as a result , a current of atoms through the optical lattice can be generated @xcite .",
    "from a physical point of view , the kinesin ( or other bio - motors ) moves in a one dimensional spatially periodic potential @xmath3 of period @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the reflection symmetry of this potential is broken @xmath5 , because the ab - heterodimers , that build the microtubule , a highway for the biomachine , are asymmetrical .",
    "this is a crucial fact because it determines the mechanism of the kinesin movement  the ratchet effect @xcite . to explain this mechanism ,",
    "let us consider as simple model as possible .",
    "we assume that the molecular motor is a particle of mass @xmath6 moving in a periodic potential @xmath7 of period l and of the barrier height @xmath8 .",
    "the equation of motion for the motor is the newton equation with a complementary random force which corresponds to thermal fluctuations , i.e. the langevin equation in the form @xmath9 inertial effects , related to the mass , are described by the first term on the left hand side .",
    "the dissipation is included via the stokes force with the friction coefficient @xmath10 which is proportional to linear size @xmath11 of the particle i.e. , @xmath12 and is additionally determined by the viscosity @xmath13 of the medium the particle moves in .",
    "the potential force @xmath14 is zero over a period l , @xmath15=0.\\ ] ] the stochastic force @xmath16 describes thermal fluctuations which can be modeled by @xmath17correlated gaussian white noise of the statistics @xmath18 according to the dissipation ",
    "fluctuation theorem , the thermal noise intensity @xmath19 is related to the friction coefficient and temperature @xmath20 of the system , i.e. , @xmath21 where @xmath22 stands for the boltzmann constant .    the external time  dependent force @xmath23 can be of any genre , both deterministic or stochastic @xcite .",
    "this force makes the system to be in a non - equilibrium state and is a source of energy for movement of motors . for biological motors",
    "it comes from chemical reactions . here , as an example and for the didactic purposes , we choose a time periodic force , namely @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the amplitude and @xmath26 stands for the frequency of the external stimulus .",
    "equivalently we can define the period @xmath27 of the external force . this kind of force can be realized for artificial motors while for biological motors , random non - equilibrium force is more adequate .      in physics",
    "only relations between scales of length , time and energy are relevant , not their absolute values",
    ". therefore we shell now translate the above equation of motion into its dimensionless form .",
    "first of all we determine characteristic quantities  time and length . the characteristic length is the period l of the potential @xmath7 and accordingly the coordinate of the molecular motor can be scaled as @xmath28 time can be scaled in several ways .",
    "one of the possibilities is the relaxation time @xmath29 of velocity or the correlation time of the velocity of the massive brownian particle moving freely and driven only by the thermal noise .",
    "it can be extracted from a special case of eq .",
    "( [ le ] ) when the right hand side is zero , i.e. , @xmath30 from the above equation it follows @xmath31 where the characteristic time @xmath32 is sometimes called the langevin time .",
    "another characteristic time comes from the overdamped motion of the particle in the potential @xmath7 , when eq .",
    "( [ le ] ) reduces to the form @xmath33 then , by inserting into above equation the characteristic quantities , we get the definition of time @xmath34 , @xmath35 during the time interval @xmath34 overdamped particle proceeds the distance @xmath36 under the influence of the constant force @xmath37 .",
    "third characteristic time follows from the friction less equation of motion , i.e. , when eq .",
    "( [ le ] ) takes the form @xmath38 from the above equation the characteristic time @xmath39 is given by the relations @xmath40 one can distinguish also other characteristic times like time period of the external driving @xmath20 or the well known einstein diffusion time @xmath41 now we can rescale the equation of motion for the massive brownian particle in several ways . doing this we shell",
    "take as the relevant time scales these times which differs for different systems , like @xmath39 or @xmath34 .",
    "let us note that the langevin time and the einstein diffusion time do not depend on the system itself , i.e. , on the potential and the external driving forces .",
    "let us first propose @xmath42 as the relevant time scale , i.e. the rescaled dimensionless time is @xmath43 .",
    "the dimensionless form of the langevin equation then reads @xmath44 where dot denotes derivative with respect to the rescaled time @xmath45 , @xmath46 denotes the rescaled potential force and @xmath47 stands for the rescaled external driving force with the rescaled amplitude @xmath48 and frequency @xmath49 .",
    "the rescaled spatially periodic potential @xmath50 has the unit period and the unit barrier height .",
    "the dimensionless mass @xmath51 is a ratio of the two characteristic times .",
    "the rescaled thermal noise @xmath52 has exactly the same statistical properties as @xmath16 .",
    "the dimensionless noise intensity @xmath53 is a ratio of thermal energy to activation energy the particle needs to traverse the non  rescaled potential barrier .",
    "on the other hand , if we choose the dimensionless time @xmath54 and @xmath39 as a time scale then we end up with another version of the rescaled langevin equation , namely @xmath55 the dimensionless friction coefficient is a ratio of two characteristic times , different then previous two , namely , @xmath56 the rescaled driving force @xmath57 with the rescaled amplitude @xmath48 and frequency @xmath58 .    two different scaling are useful in two limiting regimes : eq .",
    "( [ les1 ] ) in the overdamped case ( when @xmath59 is a small parameter ) while eq .",
    "( [ les ] ) in the underdamped case ( when @xmath60 is a small parameter ) .",
    "let us evaluate characteristic times for one of the best known biological motor , namely , kinesin which moves along a microtubule . as already mentioned in the introduction , microtubules are spatially periodic structures of period @xmath4 .",
    "the mass of the kinesin head domain is of order @xmath61 and its radius is @xmath62 .",
    "the friction coefficient @xmath63 is calculated from the stokes formula with the use of the viscosity of water ( @xmath64 ) . in a typical brownian domain",
    "the activation energy is 5 time higher than the thermal energy , @xmath65 and the temperature inside cell is about @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "w can now estimate the typical characteristic times for the kinesin moving inside human cell ; thus @xmath68    the dimensionless mass ( [ mass ] ) in the first scaling and the dimensionless friction ( [ friction ] ) in the second scaling have the following values @xmath69    one can note that the value of the parameter @xmath70 is very small .",
    "therefore eq .",
    "( [ les1 ] ) seems to be more appropriate than eq .",
    "( [ les ] ) because ( [ les1 ] ) contains the small parameter @xmath70 .",
    "this allows , with a very good approximation , to put formally @xmath71 in the dimensionless equation of motion ( [ les1 ] ) yielding @xmath72 analysis of this equation is much easier than eq .",
    "( [ les1 ] ) . from ( [ licz ] )",
    "it follows that the case of overdamped dynamics takes place for biological motors . on the other hand , eq .",
    "( [ les ] ) contains the parameter @xmath73 and one can not find justifiable arguments to neglect any term in it .",
    "so , this equation is much harder to analyze in a complete manner .",
    "however , if one wants to investigate some particular effects like the influence of the inertia on the transport , eq .",
    "( [ les ] ) is more practicable . for other motors , especially non - biological",
    ", inertial effect can be crucial .",
    "an example is an atomic brownian motor moving in optical lattices @xcite and eq .",
    "( 1 ) in @xcite .",
    "it is worth to stress that if the non - equilibrium driving is of the form ( [ g ] ) , the dynamics can be chaotic in some regimes leading to anomalous transport behavior like negative mobility or negative conductivity @xcite .",
    "below , we present characteristics of transport in full regime , from underdamped to overdamped one . from now on we will use the later scaling ( [ les ] ) while defining performance characteristics of the motion of the brownian motor and shell omit all the hats in eq .",
    "( [ les ] ) , for the sake of simplicity .",
    "when one study the motion of molecular motors , the most important transport measure is an average stationary velocity @xmath74 of the motor @xcite .",
    "averaging should be performed over all realization of thermal noise , initial conditions and over a period of the external driving .",
    "average velocity describes how much time a typical particle needs to overcome a given distance in the asymptotic ( long  time ) state .",
    "this average velocity , however , is not the only transport attribute .",
    "other characteristics are also important .",
    "we will analyze two following transport aspects : quality and energetic efficiency .",
    "the quality of transport can be characterized by the effective diffusion coefficient @xmath75 , i.e. , by the fluctuations in the position space @xcite @xmath76 where the brackets @xmath77 denote averaging over all realizations of thermal noise and initial conditions .",
    "the third quantifier is the efficiency of noise rectification @xcite .",
    "the motor moves in viscous media .",
    "therefore the minimal energy input required to move a particle in presence of friction @xmath10 over a given distance depends on the velocity . in this case , the rectification efficiency is given by the formula @xcite @xmath78 the average input power @xmath79 corresponding to system described by eq .",
    "( [ les ] ) is given by the formula @xmath80,\\ ] ] where @xmath81 is defined in eq .",
    "( [ d0 ] ) .",
    "this expression follows from the energy balance of the underlying equation of motion ( [ les ] ) @xcite .",
    "to examplify the above ideas we analyze eq .",
    "( [ les ] ) in the long - time asymptotic , time  periodic regime after effects of the initial conditions and transient processes have died out .",
    "then , the statistical quantifiers of interest can be determined in terms of the statistical average over the different realizations of the process ( [ les ] ) and over the driving period @xmath20 . since there are no analytical methods to handle ( [ les ] ) , we made use of numerical approach and have carried out extensive and precise numerical simulations , applying stochastic runge  kutta algorithm of order 2 .",
    "for the initial conditions we took points from uniformly distributed circle in the phase space @xmath82 with the radius @xmath83 and the origin in the point ( @xmath84 , 0 ) , where @xmath84 denotes minimum of the potential @xmath85 . for the illustration of the above idea we fixed the following set of parameters : @xmath86 , @xmath87 and the potential profile @xmath88 $ ] , where @xmath89 reduces the maximal barrier height to unity .",
    "the forces corresponding to this potential ranges from the minimal value -2.14 to the maximal value 4.28 . if the amplitude @xmath90 of the driving is higher than 4.28 , the motor is able to overcome the potential barrier in any direction just with the use of the external driving force and without of thermal noise .",
    "we analyze the system ( [ les ] ) in the 2-dimensional parameter space @xmath91 .",
    "we change the rescaled friction coefficient @xmath10 from @xmath92 ( underdamped dynamics ) to @xmath93 ( overdamped dynamics ) .",
    "the external time periodic force strength @xmath90 varies between 0 and 5 , where the later is just above the maximal value of the potential force .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show three characteristics in the low temperature regime , @xmath94 , cf .",
    "( [ d0 ] ) . in panel ( a ) , we depict the stationary average velocity of the motor .",
    "white area corresponds to the case when the absolute value of the velocity is small , @xmath95 .",
    "blue ( or gray ) areas surrounded by contours stands for the negative mean velocity and red ( gray ) color indicates regions of positive velocity .",
    "it is seen that for a chosen set of parameters the brownian motor has a noticeable velocity for the force amplitude @xmath96 and for not strong damping @xmath97 .",
    "strictly speaking , the velocity is not exactly zero assuming very small values of order @xmath98 ( white area on fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( a ) ) . by inspecting the several colored ( gray ) areas",
    ", one can observe that the velocity as a function of @xmath10 or the amplitude @xmath90 exhibits the multiple velocity reversals @xcite .",
    "because the friction coefficient @xmath10 depends on the linear size of the motor , it means that motors of different sizes can move in opposite directions . in panel",
    "( b ) we show the rectification efficiency ( [ eta ] ) .",
    "there , white area corresponds to efficiency smaller that @xmath99 .",
    "the correlation of dark regions in panels ( a ) and ( b ) is evident .",
    "there are two main islands of efficient energy conversion ",
    "one for @xmath100 and second for @xmath101 . in the region of parameters",
    "@xmath102 , the motor efficiency is very high and is almost 90% ( remember that the system is far from an equilibrium state ) . in panel ( c )",
    "we show the effective diffusion coefficient of the motor .",
    "large value of this quantifier means low quality of motion - brownian particles move in a very irregular manner .",
    "this region of high efficiency and low quality of motion ( high diffusion ) , makes our stochastic model similar to deterministic @xcite or hamiltonian @xcite systems .    upon the inspection of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] one can notice that for the parameter island with large _ negative _ average velocity and high efficiency ( large area around @xmath103 and @xmath104 ) , the motor moves quite irregularly because @xmath75 is large .",
    "for the island with large _ positive _ velocity and medium efficiency ( smaller area around @xmath105 and @xmath106 ) , the effective diffusion is small reflecting good quality of transport and regular motion .",
    "let us consider the case of higher temperature , @xmath107 .",
    "transitions of a particle over potential barriers are easier and details of the shape of the potential is not so important now . as one can see from panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , absolute values of the average velocity are one order smaller than in the previous temperature regime . higher temperature makes the motor motion slower in both negative  blue ( gray ) contoured areas , or positive  red ( gray ) colored regions .",
    "again as in the previous case , in the the 2-dimensional parameter space @xmath91 , we can identify the velocity reversal phenomenon upon the change of the control parameters @xmath90 or @xmath10 . in the negative direction the maximal velocity @xmath108 and in the positive direction @xmath109 . in the optimal regime ,",
    "the efficiency of the motor transport is of order 1% .",
    "the only characteristic which seems to be better than in the previous scenario is the effective diffusion presented in panel ( c ) .",
    "the motor seems to move in a much more regular manner than for lower temperature yielding maximum value of @xmath110 for underdamped system .",
    "it is a region where the averaged velocity is almost zero and the efficiency is very low .",
    "comparison of figs 1 and 2 leads to the conclusion that the influence of higher temperature is rather destructive .",
    "the only better quantifier is the effective diffusion coefficient which is smaller .",
    "it means that the islands in the parameter space @xmath91 for higher temperature with relatively high ( negative or positive ) velocity accompanied by the highest possible efficiency represent regimes where the motor moves rather in a regular way .",
    "the most demanded properties of any transporting machinery are : efficiency and quality .",
    "the latter in our case is characterized by the effective diffusion coefficient .",
    "let us note that even in any equilibrium system the particle can be transported over long distances due to thermal diffusion .",
    "it is , however , very unreliable when the distance becomes large because the diffusion can not distinguish direction and most of traveling particles would not arrive at prescribed destination in a reasonable time . on the other hand , from figs [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ]",
    "we can see that the large diffusion is sometimes in regimes where the energetic efficiency is high . in real situations",
    ", nature chooses between above scenarios . under some circumstances ,",
    "if e.g. the distances are small , the diffusion can be exploited to transport the cargo and no energy is wasted . when the distance is larger , then the non  equilibrium transport is applied and reliability is achieved sacrificing the energy input .",
