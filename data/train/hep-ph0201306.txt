    "exclusive hadronic processes at large momentum transfer in which the total of particles ( partons ) in the initial and final states is @xmath0 are becoming increasingly important in testing various aspects of qcd . the tree - level results for the cross section of these processes , being proportional to a high power of the qcd coupling constant @xmath1 , are very sensitive to the variation of the renormalization scale and scheme being used .",
    "consequently , to stabilize the leading - order ( tree - level ) predictions and to achieve a complete confrontation between theoretical predictions and experimental data , at least one - loop ( nlo ) corrections are necessary .",
    "the main theoretical difficulty in obtaining the nlo predictions consists in the treatment of the occurring @xmath2-point one - loop scalar and tensor integrals with massless internal lines . through the scalarization and reduction procedures @xcite , the computation of such integrals reduces to the calculation of a set comprised of six box ( @xmath3 )",

    "based on the above consideration , the expression for the ir finite one - loop scalar box integral can be written as @xmath91 the first term on the right - hand side in ( [ eq : f61 ] ) represents the expression for the ir finite triangle scalar integral .",

    "note that as a consequence of choosing @xmath98 in an appropriate way , the causal @xmath12 appears only in one of the logarithms in ( [ eq : f35 ] ) .    the second term on the right - hand side in ( [ eq : f61 ] )",
    "is the correction term .",
    "as stated earlier , it accounts for the fact that in the product of two kinematic variables we lose information about the phases which can lead to missing some poles .",

    "@xcite and found agreement in all the kinematic regions .",
    "using the mellin - barnes integral representations , the calculation of the ir finite one - loop box scalar integral with massless internal lines has been reduced to the calculation of the ir finite triangle scalar integral with massless internal lines .",
    "the result is presented in a very simple and compact form ( only two dilogarithms ) and , owing to the fact that we have kept the causal @xmath12 systematically throughout the calculation , is quite general , i.e. valid for arbitrary values of the relevant kinematic variables . from the practical point of view",
    ", the main advantage of our result over the results previously obtained is that the arguments of the occurring logarithms and dilogarithms are very simple , which enables one to separate the real and imaginary part of the integral very easily .",
