    "a dramatic change in the dynamic history of the universe happened since 1998 when observations from type ia supernovae @xcite claimed our universe to be expanding with certain acceleration .",
    "this peculiar result was verified in several independent observations @xcite supporting the present accelerating phase of our universe . however , this observational prediction required a perfect theoretical explanation behind such a scenario , and finally , the cosmologists came up to the conclusion that our universe must contain some exotic components with large negative pressure . in equation of state",
    "( hereafter we call it as eos ) of these components , the ratio of total pressure to the total energy density satisfies the condition `` @xmath3 '' .",
    "the components with this condition are dubbed `` dark energy '' to differ from other normal matter components ( with positive pressure ) in our universe . however , among the several dark energy candidates , the best description for our present accelerating universe is the @xmath4cdm model due to its satisfactory agreement with the current astronomical data we have . still , the model suffers with two very known serious problems : the first one , known as the cosmological constant problem , is in huge ( of the order 10@xmath5 ) difference between the observed value of the cosmological constant and its predicted value by the quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "the second problem , the cosmic coincidence problem @xcite , is in surprising fact , that the dark energy density has the same order of magnitude as the matter density in our universe today , though these two quantities have different laws of evolution .    on the other hand ,",
    "observations @xcite show that the accelerating phase is a late - time phenomenon , starting at a redshift @xmath6 . according to the hot big bang cosmology , before the present acceleration our universe went through a decelerating radiation and matter dominating phases .",
    "so , we have the main question at this point .",
    "did our universe contain some dark energy component which was insignificant during the phase of deceleration and now it began dominating over the matter sector ?",
    "two possible probable answers could be like this : may be the dark energy component is dynamical in nature , or , may be there is an energy exchange programme between dark matter and dark energy which , as a result , forces the dark energy component to accelerate our universe .",
    "the case of dynamical dark energy has been widely studied in the literature ( see the review @xcite and the references therein ) as an alternative explanation for @xmath4 . unfortunately , these models suffer from several unexplained problems .",
    "in particular , recent observations @xcite claim that the eos for the dark energy @xmath7 is slightly more negative than the cosmological constant , i.e. , @xmath8 . in order to describe this stage , we need some phantom scalar field which violates the dominant energy condition @xmath9 , and the energy density ( @xmath10 ) , pressure ( @xmath11 ) assume the forms @xmath12 , @xmath13 , leading to @xmath14 .",
    "but , it differs from the normal scale field from the wrong sign in the kinetic term @xcite .",
    "although the phantom scalar field is a promising candidate for describing the @xmath8 phase , but , at the classical and quantum levels , the scalar field solutions suffer from instabilities @xcite .",
    "further , the models have some serious theoretical problems @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the interacting dynamics is quite interesting and useful .",
    "the dynamics of the universe gets richer while we bring the interaction between the dark sectors , however , we get back the non - interacting scenario when we make this interaction to be ` zero ' . however , the interacting dynamics became popular since this mechanism was found to alleviate the cosmic coincidence problem @xcite ( for a review on interacting dark energy see refs .",
    "further , it has been discussed that some appropriate choice of an interaction between the dark components can influence effectively on the perturbation analysis which results in quite notable differences in the lowest multipoles of the cosmic microwave background spectrum @xcite . moreover , the realization of a phantom universe through interacting dynamics , as suggested in @xcite , has been slightly favored by the current observational data @xcite .",
    "thus , based on the above arguments , it is evident that one can not exclude the possibility of mutual interaction among the dark sectors , and this can be considered as an alternative description for our present universe .    in the present work we consider dark energy ( de ) and the cold dark matter ( cdm ) to be the dominant sources in our universe , which are interacting in nature .",
    "for our analysis we use the general analytic form @xcite of this interaction , which is the linear combination of de and matter energy densities .",
    "then we constrain model parameters by the joint analysis of union 2.1 , hubble and baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) data sets .",
    "it is worth noting that the present model with interacting dark components works well in comparison with the @xmath4cdm model and other popular cosmological models ( sect .",
    "[ comparison ] ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ dynamics ] , we describe the basic equations of interacting dynamics in the non - flat flrw model . for the linear interaction between de and cdm , section [ analytic ]",
    "presents the analytic solutions for @xmath1const , in the eos of de and 5 variants of the model for variable @xmath0 . in section [ data - analysis ] ,",
    "we shortly discuss different joint data analysis techniques and the results of their application to the considered several variants of our model . in section [ comparison ] , we compare this model with other popular models in describing the same observational data .",
    "finally , in section [ conclu ] , we summarize the results of the work .",
    "on the largest scale , our universe is homogeneous and isotropic in nature , its geometry is described by the friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) line element @xmath15,\\label{flrw}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 ( hereafter we shall denote it by ` @xmath17 ' ) is the scale factor of the universe , @xmath18 is the curvature sign of the space - time , which for open , flat and closed universe takes the values @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "the description for the matter sector in our universe in agreement with the homogeneous and isotropic flrw metric assumes a perfect fluid distribution with the energy - momentum tensor @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 are respectively the pressure and the energy density of a perfect fluid under consideration , @xmath25 is the four velocity of a fluid particle .",
    "now , the governing dynamical equations of our universe are obtained by solving the einstein s field equations without cosmological constant @xmath26 which for the metric ( [ flrw ] ) and the energy - momentum tensor of the perfect fluid ( [ energy - momentum ] ) lead to the following well known friedmann equations : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the hubble parameter , @xmath29 is the einstein s gravitational constant . from the bianchi s identity",
    "we get the conservation equation @xmath30 , that for the perfect fluid takes the form @xmath31 the last equation ( [ continuity ] ) could also be obtained by using eqs .",
    "( [ friedmann1 ] ) and ( [ friedmann2 ] ) . however , we have two independent equations , which in principle can describe the complete dynamics of the universe .",
    "now , it is clear that under barotropic equation of state ( eos ) @xmath32 , where @xmath33const , is the eos parameter for the perfect fluid , the conservation equation ( [ continuity ] ) can be solved as @xmath34 , @xmath35 being the present value of the energy density .",
    "we note that for the present value of the scale factor here and below we suppose @xmath36 ( @xmath37 is the present value of the cosmic time ) .",
    "so , if we suppose that the cold matter with @xmath38 satisfies eq .",
    "( [ continuity ] ) separately ( in other words , it does not interact with dark energy ) , we have @xmath39 . if we consider an independent dark energy component with eos @xmath40const , we have @xmath41 . here",
    "@xmath42 , @xmath43 are the present day values of the densities for cold matter and the dark energy , respectively .    according to the present day observations @xcite ,",
    "most of the universe content is unknown to us . around 26% of the total energy budget",
    "is filled with pressureless cold dark matter , 70% in the form of dark energy ( de ) , rest are filled with about 4% of baryons and negligible radiation ( 0.005% ) .",
    "so , the present universe is completely dominated by the cold dark matter and dark energy with energy densities @xmath44 and @xmath45 respectively .",
    "we introduce an interacting scenario between cold dark matter ( cdm ) and de through an phenomenological interaction term @xmath46 which in general could be @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , the introduction of @xmath46 modify the conservation equations for cdm and de as @xmath48 whereas for the total energy density of cdm and de @xmath49 the energy conservation satisfies eq .",
    "( [ continuity ] ) @xmath50 which is the sum of eqs .",
    "( [ conservation1 ] ) and ( [ conservation2 ] ) .",
    "the total density @xmath24 in eqs .",
    "( [ friedmann1])([continuity ] ) includes the density @xmath51 of cdm and de and the baryon contribution @xmath52 : @xmath53 ( here and below we neglect radiation ) .",
    "baryons do not interact with de in eqs .",
    "( [ conservation1 ] ) , ( [ conservation2 ] ) , their density @xmath54 satisfies the same equation ( [ continuity ] ) or ( [ continuity - total ] ) .",
    "however , using eq .",
    "( [ continuity - total ] ) , one can express @xmath55 and @xmath44 as follows : @xmath56 here primes denote derivatives with respect to @xmath57 .",
    "so , once @xmath51 is determined , the evolution equations for cold dark matter and dark energy can be completely understood .",
    "the interaction term @xmath46 in eqs .",
    "( [ conservation1 ] ) , ( [ conservation2 ] ) is phenomenological in nature , however , we will concentrate mostly on such interactions , which either provide analytic solutions for the components or successfully describe the current observational data .",
    "we introduce the following interaction @xcite @xmath58 where @xmath59 , @xmath60 are the coupling parameters . due to the expression ( [ interaction1 ] ) the conservation equations ( [ conservation1 ] ) and ( [ conservation2 ] ) are modified , and finally , we get the following second order differential equation : @xmath61 \\rho_t= 0 . \\label{diffeqn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    now , until the nature of the de equation of state be discovered , it is really difficult to infer about evolution of dark energy as well as dark matter . still , we can look for possible evolution equations if @xmath0 in eq .",
    "( [ diffeqn ] ) is constant or variable , and finally , we aim to study them from recent observational data .",
    "if @xmath1const , the solution of the differential equation ( [ diffeqn ] ) becomes @xcite @xmath62 where @xmath63 , @xmath64 are integration constants , @xmath65 , @xmath66 are @xmath67    now , using ( [ energy - const ] ) , we have the explicit analytic solutions for dust and dark energy as follows : @xmath68    we note that there are very few works in the literature , where the analytic solutions for interacting dark energy has been explicitly found @xcite .",
    "thus , the analytic solutions for the present interaction is one of the interesting findings in the literature of interacting dynamics .",
    "however , we note that in ref .  @xcite the authors found the analytic solutions for this linear interaction in a restricted way , i.e. they excluded the product @xmath69 and analyzed the solutions for @xmath70 , @xmath71 , which means that complete information",
    "was not reported .",
    "also , the analysis of this model was performed only by @xmath72 supernovae type ia data from @xcite where the nature of the coupling parameters and their estimations were not addressed .",
    "thus , in comparison with the previous study , the present one has two fold importance : ( i ) the solutions ( [ energy - const ] ) for general ( @xmath73 ) completes the study without any information loss , and ( ii ) here we employ the current observational data which provide better observational constraints on all model parameters .",
    "thus , under ( i ) and ( ii ) , the present analytic interacting dark energy model could produce some interesting information about this interacting dark energy - dark matter model while constraining it by recent observational data sets .",
    "further , the present day density parameters for dark matter ( @xmath74 @xmath75 ) and dark energy ( @xmath74 @xmath76 ) in terms of the density parameters for the equivalent two fluids @xmath77 and @xmath78 are given by @xmath79 where @xmath80 .",
    "the values @xmath77 , @xmath78 can be expressed by using the above two equations ( [ omega_matter ] ) , ( [ omega_de ] ) , their consequence @xmath81 and the equality @xmath82 results in from eq .  ( [ friedmann1 ] ) at the present time @xmath83 .",
    "here @xmath84 , @xmath85 . in particular , @xmath86 also , we note that the present value of the total density parameter for matter is @xmath87 . in sect .",
    "[ data - analysis ] ( see fig .  [ f1 ] ) we investigate how solutions ( [ energy - const ] ) describe the observational data for type ia supernovae , baryon acoustic oscillations and for the hubble parameter @xmath88 .      the nature of dark energy is still elusive , after completion of several dark energy projects .",
    "observations support models with various forms of de resulting in effective value of @xmath89 close to ` @xmath19 ' @xcite .",
    "they include not only @xmath4cdm with well known advantages and vague nature of @xmath4 , but also models with different eos for some de component .",
    "since no one has a concrete answer to the question about nature of de , thus , one may , of course , think of the most suitable eos for de , keeping in mind that it is really difficult to find some ` at least ' approximate form for @xmath0 which could survive with the present observational data .",
    "so , while choosing some variable form for eos , we need to solve eq .",
    "( [ diffeqn ] ) and consequently , we must be very cautious in order to see its effect on our universe .",
    "there are several interacting dark energy models with possibility of variable eos in de , where reasonable attention has been paid to observational data . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors investigated an interacting scenario for @xmath90 with chevallier - polarski - linder ( cpl ) parametrization @xcite as the equation of state in de . also , in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors studied the present linear interaction ( [ interaction1 ] ) with cpl parametrization but with very old data ( 182 gold type ia supernoave data @xcite ) .",
    "thus , considering the linear interaction ( [ interaction1 ] ) in our discussion , we aim to investigate the interacting dynamics between cdm an de with some new variable equations of state in @xmath0 including cpl @xcite and linear parametrization @xcite by union 2.1 compilation @xcite along with hubble parameter measurements and baryon acoustic oscillation data .",
    "let us first begin our analysis with the following generalized ansatz @xmath91 where @xmath92 , @xmath93 are real numbers .",

    "it is interesting to consider the model with interaction ( [ interaction1 ] ) and chevallier - polarski - linder ( cpl ) parametrization @xcite @xmath103 and also with linear parametrization @xcite @xmath104 here @xmath95 , @xmath105 are two free parameters to be constrained by the observational data in which @xmath95 is the present value of @xmath0 as mentioned earlier .",
    "the dependencies of @xmath106 in ( [ ans4 ] ) and ( [ ans5 ] ) are alternative to ( [ solution - ga ] ) .",
