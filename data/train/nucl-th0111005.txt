    "constituent quark models have been widely used to predict the properties of baryon resonances . however , a large number of resonance states which appear in the constituent quark models have not been observed in pion - nucleon scattering .",
    "it has been argued  @xcite that such `` missing resonances '' either decouple from the pion - nucleon channel or are masked by the neighboring resonances which have large @xmath1 decay widths .",
    "this has led to suggestions that other reaction channels such as vector meson productions@xcite might be more sensitive to these missing states .",
    "however , all possibilities have not been exhausted in the @xmath2  n channel .",
    "one such possibility is to consider the polarization observables .",
    "while efforts@xcite are being made to measure the single polarizations , it will be interesting to explore double polarizations which could be more effective in revealing some of the missing resonances through the interference between the resonant and background(non - resonant ) amplitudes .",
    "investigations of these double polarization observables is timely and topical as they coincide with the availability of new opportunities to measure them at jefferson lab and other laboratories .    as a step in this direction ,",
    "we will explore in this paper how the double polarization observables of pion photoproduction can be used to investigate nucleon resonances in the higher energy region ( 1.6 @xmath3 2.1 gev ) in which a lot of missing resonances have been suggested . in this energy region , a complete dynamical approach to pion photoproduction , such as that developed@xcite in the investigation of the @xmath4 resonance , is still being developed .",
    "the main difficulty is due to the large number of resonance states and the complexities of the couplings between several meson - baryon channels . for our present very limited purpose",
    ", we will introduce some rather drastic simplifications in using a formulation which is a direct extension of the dynamical formulation of ref.@xcite .",
    "this will then allow us to address the question concerning the missing resonances by relating the resonant amplitude directly to the predictions from a constituent quark model .",
    "as an example , we will consider the predictions by capstick and roberts@xcite .    in section",
    "ii , we will give explicitly the formulation used in our calculations .",
    "our findings will be discussed in section iii .",
    "the differential cross section of @xmath5 in the center of mass ( c.m . ) frame can be written as , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are respectively the momenta of the incident photon and outgoing pion , and @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are the spin projections of the initial nucleon , final nucleon , and incoming photon , respectively . for a total invariant mass @xmath11 ,",

    "these empirical amplitudes are obtained by the following procedure . for each partial wave ,",
    "the multipole amplitude is written as a sum of the conventional born term , vector - meson - exchange , and a many - parameter phenomenological term .",
    "the amplitudes are unitarized by using the empirical @xmath1 phase shifts which are also available in the said program .",
    "the empirical pion photoproduction multipole amplitude are then obtained by adjusting the parameters of the phenomenological term to perform @xmath21-fits to all of the existing data of @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 reactions from threshold up to invariant mass w=2.1 gev . in this work",
    "we use the sm01 solutions@xcite from their energy - dependent fits .",
    "more details about the said program can be found in refs.@xcite and @xcite .    following the formulation of ref .",
    "@xcite , we write the resonant amplitude as @xmath25 @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the mass of a @xmath28 with spin quantum numbers @xmath29 . here",
    "we neglect the effect due to the non - resonant mechanisms on the @xmath28 decay amplitude and the shift of the resonance position .",
    "then the resonance mass @xmath30 and the @xmath28 decay amplitude @xmath31 can be identified with the predictions from a quark model , as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we however do not have information about the total decay width @xmath32 for most of the @xmath28 s considered here . for simplicity , we assume that its energy - dependence is similar to the width of the @xmath33 decay within the oscillator constituent quark model .",
    "following ref . @xcite and neglecting the real part of the mass shift , we then have @xmath34 , \\label{n*:decay}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the orbital angular momentum of the considered @xmath1 state and @xmath36 in the above equations , @xmath37 is the pion momentum at energy @xmath38 while the on - shell momentum @xmath39 is evaluated at @xmath40 .",
    "the energies are defined by @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "our choice of the total average width @xmath43 and cutoff parameter @xmath44 for eq .",

    "iii .    by setting the photon momentum in the @xmath45-direction , the @xmath46 amplitude ( @xmath47 ) in eq .",
    "( [ t : n * ] ) can be calculated from the helicity amplitude @xmath48 listed in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath49 the @xmath50 amplitude ( @xmath51 ) takes the following form @xcite @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the @xmath2 meson momentum at @xmath54 .",
    "here we also include an extrapolation factor @xmath55 $ ] similar to that for defining the width eq.(5 ) .    by using the information in refs.@xcite",
    ", we can get helicity amplitude @xmath56 of eq.(7 ) and partial - wave transition strength @xmath57 of eq.(8 ) predicted by capstick and roberts .",
    "the resulting values for the considered 30 @xmath28 and 26 @xmath58 are listed in tables i - iv .",
    "our first task is to calculate the resonant amplitude defined by eqs .",
    "( [ resampeq])-([omegan * ] ) . with the helicity amplitude @xmath56 and partial - wave transition strength @xmath57 given in tables i - iv",
    ", this amplitude depends only on the choice of the total width @xmath43 and the cutoff @xmath44 in eqs.(5 ) and ( 8) . for simplicity",
    ", we set @xmath44 = 650 mev for all resonances considered .",
    "this value is close to what was determined in the investigation of @xmath59@xcite .",
    "the widths of the known @xmath28 resonances listed in  @xcite range from 200 - 400 mev .",
    "we therefore take their average value and set @xmath60 mev for all @xmath28 resonances listed in tables i - ii . for the similar reason",
    ", we set @xmath61 mev for the considered @xmath58 resonances listed in tables iii - iv . with these specifications , the resonant amplitude eq.(4 ) can be computed with no adjustable parameters . since the full amplitude @xmath20 is taken from",
    "said program , the non - resonant(background ) amplitude @xmath62 for our investigation can then be fixed by @xmath63.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with the background amplitude defined above , we then use eq.(2 ) to investigate the role of each resonance in determining the resonance amplitude . in fig .",
    "[ amp ] , we first observe that the differential cross sections(solid curves ) calculated from the employed said amplitude agree well with the available data .",
    "the dashed curves are obtained when the the effects due to all of the considered 56 resonance states are removed .",
    "we see that the nucleon resonance effects on the unpolarized differential cross sections are not very pronounced .",
    "furthermore none of the considered resonances listed in tables i - iv dominate the difference between the full calculation(solid curves ) and the background only calculation(dashed curves ) .",
    "obviously , it is not easy to investigate the nucleon resonances by only considering the unpolarized differential cross sections .",
    "this is similar to the finding of ref.@xcite in a investigation of @xmath64 photoproduction .",
    "we now turn to reporting our investigations of the polarization observables .",
    "before we discussing the double polarization observables , we show in fig .  2 some typical results from our calculations of single polarization observables .",
    "as expected , the effects due to nucleon resonances are much more visible here .",
    "hopefully , these predictions can be tested in the near future when the data from the on - going experiments become available .        where @xmath67 is the cross - section @xmath68 and the superscripts @xmath69 denote the polarizations of the beam , target ; recoil and meson respectively .",
    "@xmath70 corresponds to a circularly polarized photon beam with helicity  +  1 , @xmath71 represents the direction of the nucleon polarization , and u represents the unpolarized particle .",
    "the coordinate system is chosen such that the incoming photon is in the z - direction and x - z plane is the reaction plane .",
    "thus y - direction is perpendicular to the reaction plane .",
    "we have performed extensive calculations of the two double polarization observables , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , in the energy region 1.6 gev @xmath74 w @xmath75 2.1 gev . as expected ,",
    "the resonance effects are much more pronounced than what can be observed in fig.1 for the unpolarized differential cross sections or fig.2 . for the single polarization observables .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.3 for the beam - target polarization and fig.4 for the beam - recoil polarization for two typical angles at 90 and 120 degrees .",
    "our next task is to explore the favorable kinematic regions where only one or just a limited number of nucleon resonances among the 56 considered resonance states will dominant . we have found that at angles close to 120 degrees the resonance effects on the beam - recoil polarization ( eq.(11 ) ) are mainly due to the four - star resonances @xmath76 of table i and @xmath77 and @xmath78 of table ii , and the two - star resonance @xmath79 of table ii . furthermore the @xmath79 state has the largest effect among about 50 two - star and missing resonances in this higher energy region .",
    "this is shown in fig.5 .",
    "we see that by adding only the two - star @xmath79 to the calculation including only background and three four - star resonances , the predicted beam - recoil polarizations are shifted from the dashed curves to the dot - dashed curves which are close to the results from full calculations including all resonances listed in tables i - iv .",
    "the investigation of the two - star @xmath79 is clearly most favorable in the @xmath22 channel .",
    "our results suggest that data on the double polarization observables of pion photoproduction in the region 1.6  @xmath80  w  @xmath802.1 gev could be very useful in investigating nucleon resonances .",
    "the experiments on these observables would be complementary to other similarly motivated ongoing experiments on vector meson photoproduction and kaon photoproduction .",
    "moreover , these double polarization observables should be accessible at facilities such as jefferson lab and spring-8 . to end , we like to mention that some experimental data on double polarization observables have recently become available in the @xmath81 channel for w  @xmath82  1.6 gev  @xcite , but there is no data on the other two charged channels .",
