    "research into disease - related health variables typically involve choosing health variables and conditions , and using statistical methods to study the strength of association of the variables with the condition  @xcite .",
    "these are then used to confirm known or suspected relationships between the behavioural / health factors or disease conditions .",
    "there may be information about health status that may be gleaned by considering different aspects of an individual s data , and investigating possible relationships between the variables .",
    "representations that capture these relationships can be useful in predicting presence or risk level of medical conditions .",
    "the national health and nutrition examination survey ( nhanes ) dataset provides data on health measurements , taken from survey participants , comprising different categories including demographics , laboratory tests and physical measurements .",
    "in this project , each of these categories are thought of as separate views of the participants data .",
    "canonical correlation analysis @xcite , a multi - view learning technique , is used to learn representations that capture information from two different views .",
    "the major consideration in this project is the use of the available nhanes data for multiview analysis .",
    "multiview learning is useful when the data exists in partitions such that each partition(view ) is a natural combination of the variables .",
    "the purpose of multiview learning is to exploit the redundancy or common information in the different views to improve performance or provide more insight into the data .",
    "the nhanes data fits naturally in a multiview scenario because the data is collected in categories pertinent to the overall health status of an individual .",
    "demographics data , laboratory test results , or physical measurements are examples of natural partitions of the data that can be considered as individual views .    the features obtained from applying multiview techniques to the data optimize properties that help to incorporate information from the different views into a single representation .",
    "therefore , these features may be useful for predicting or classifying certain health conditions of an individual .",
    "the multiview features may give additional information that will otherwise be lost by considering only pre - determined health indicators .",
    "this is investigated for the case of diabetes classification , considering both known diabetes predictors and multiview features .",
    "the national health and nutrition examination survey ( nhanes ) is an ongoing survey designed to measure the health and nutritional status of the u.s . population .",
    "the survey referred to in this work is the continuous nhanes data , which was initiated in 1999 , not to be confused with the nhanes(i , ii and iii ) surveys from previous years .",
    "the survey is conducted by the national center for health and statistics ( nchs ) , which is a part of the center for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) . the survey utilizes a nationally representative sample of the us noninstitutionalized , civilian population identified through a multistage probability sampling design .",
    "the sample for each year consists of about 5000 participants .",
    "the survey consists of an interview section and a physical examination .",
    "the participants go through a comprehensive interview involving demographic , nutrition and health - related behavioral questions .",
    "this includes questionnaires about participants medical conditions , alcohol / tobacco use , and other medically pertinent details .",
    "the examination component consists of physical as well as physiological measurements , so it includes measures like height , weight , blood pressure and so on .",
    "bodily fluids such as blood and urine are also collected , and the results of several laboratory tests are also released as part of the participants data . the general structure of the data collected is shown in  [ fig : data_str ] .",
    "information gotten from the nhanes data is used to determine the prevalence of major diseases and risk factors for diseases , assess nutritional status and its association with health promotion and disease prevention , and form the basis for national standards for such measurements as height , weight , and blood pressure @xcite .",
    "the data is used to compile most of the statistics used to assess the health status of the country .    though the dataset appears to be a rich source of health data for the population ,",
    "there is a paucity of research work applying machine learning techniques to the dataset .",
    "a cursory google scholar  @xcite search shows little machine learning research on the nhanes data , especially considering the recent advancements in machine learning .",
    "a majority of the available literature involves investigation into the prevalence of disease conditions in certain population groups , or the association between specific variables and/or disease conditions .",
    "one of the problems with using the data is the difficulty in constructing a concrete dataset from the the survey data .",
    "because the survey is conducted and reviewed yearly , the data available is inconsistent across the years span . due to design considerations",
    ", variables may be added , removed or renamed for a new survey year , or the format might be changed totally . so compiling a complete dataset involves manually searching for variables across yearly releases , before dealing with data cleaning and missing data .",
    "the nhanes dataset is released in the form of sas xport files , where each file contains the results for a particular questionnaire , in a particular 2-year survey period .",
    "for example , demographics for the 1999 - 2000 period is contained in one file , and so on , for the different years available . at the time of this project ,",
    "the data for 2015 - 2016 was incomplete , so the data used were for the surveys done between 1999 and 2014 .",
    "the data files and related documentation are puclicly released and available at the nhanes website @xcite .",
    "the documentation provides a description of each variable , the coding of its values , and the target individuals for that variable .",
    "there are problems with the dataset that make it difficult to compile the data from the different survey periods into a homogeneous , usable form . the data format for a particular category or questionnaire usually does not stay the same for different survey periods .    1",
    ".   variables are , often times , named differently from previous years .",
    "it is also common to see variables recoded for different reasons , so special care must be taken to keep the values consistent across the years .",
    "for example , after 2010 , the values for variable _ country of birth _ in the demographics component was changed from _ united states / mexico / other spanish / other non - spanish _ to _ united states / others_. 2 .",
    "a variable may be discontinued , moved to a different file , or totally unavailable in a particular year .",
    "variables have different eligibility / target criteria ( usually age , or the value of another variable ) , and some data are missing altogether .    compiling",
    "a dataset therefore involves manually checking the documentation for each data file and making appropriate cleaning decisions for each variable .",
    "it also limits the size of the dataset because variables may have to be removed to keep the data at a reasonable size .",
    ".post - cleaning variables for different data categories [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     to determine the best features for diabetes classification in this dataset , the reg features are ranked by their weights in the best linear svm model  @xcite .",
    "the ranking of the features is :    1 .",
    "waist circumference , number of alcoholic drinks per day , age , bmi , weight , height , family history , hypertension , education level , gender , income level , number of cigarettes smoked per day , race / ethnicity , smoking .",
    "the reg model scores are lower than those reported in @xcite , but are at par with the results in @xcite for similar experiments .",
    "the most significant result comes from the model with the demographics / laboratory cca features with  85% auc .",
    "this highlights the importance of cca in producing features that are correlated with the laboratory data .",
    "however , since the motivation is to have a model that can give some information about diabetes before the actual test is run , it is necessary to measure the performance of the cca features on data points not included in cca training .",
    "this can be seen in the results for model @xmath0 , and the results show a drastic performance reduction in auc from projecting all demographic data to the learned cca components .",
    "an interesting detail for the result is that the main decline is in the specificity meaning that the model produces more false positives , but the sensitivity(recall ) increases , beating even the reg model .",
    "the same procedure is applied with the cca features learnt using laboratory data with body measures as views .",
    "this gives lower performance suggesting that the demographic variables may provide more information for classifying diabetes than the body measure variables .",
    "stacking the cca features with the reg features gives worse results than the reg model , and so does not justify combining both set of features in that way .",
    "this project explores the application of multiview learning on nhanes survey data components to generate new representations of participants health .",
    "the study is motivated by the intuition that more insight can be gotten from considering different modalities of health data , and exploiting any correlations between them .",
    "the learned multiview features achieve promising results on a diabetes classification task .    a possible extensions to the project would be in constructing other views from the dataset and studying the suitability of the multiview features to relevant machine learning tasks .",
    "other multiview techniques such as deep canonical correlation analysis @xcite could also be applied , with the learned representations compared .",
    "future work will also include applying techniques that extend cca to more than two views such as generalized cca  @xcite .",
