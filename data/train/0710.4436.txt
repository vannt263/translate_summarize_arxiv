    "when a classical or quantum fluid , or an @xmath18-vector magnet with @xmath16 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 is confined by macroscopic bodies such as two parallel plates , walls , surfaces , or interfaces , of area @xmath21 , its free energy @xmath22 depends upon the distance @xmath2 between these boundary planes .",
    "the @xmath2 dependence implies a force @xmath23 between the plates , where @xmath24 is the reduced excess free energy per unit area , @xmath25 is the reduced bulk free energy density , and the limit @xmath26 has been taken @xcite . by analogy with the familiar casimir force",
    "@xcite produced by vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field between two metallic plates ( and slight abuse of language ) , @xmath27 is conventionally called `` thermodynamic casimir force . ''",
    "provided long - range interactions are either absent or negligible , this force decays exponentially for separations @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the bulk correlation length . near a continuous phase transition in @xmath1 bulk dimensions",
    ", @xmath29 diverges as @xmath30 at the bulk critical temperature @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , the casimir force @xmath31 extends to distances @xmath2 much larger than the microscopic scale @xmath32 ( @xmath33 radius of atoms , lattice constant ) .    writing @xmath34 let us decompose the excess free energy @xmath35 into an @xmath2  independent surface part @xmath36 and a residual finite - size contribution @xmath37 .",
    "the latter behaves as @xmath38 at the bulk critical point @xmath39 , and hence produces the long - ranged effective force @xmath40 here @xmath11 , the so - called casimir amplitude @xcite , is a universal quantity , which depends on the bulk universality class of the phase transition considered and gross properties of the boundary plates , but is independent of microscopic details .",
    "such thermodynamic casimir forces have been the subject of much interest recently @xcite .",
    "clear experimental evidence for their existence has been found in the thinning of wetting layers of liquid @xmath41he as a function of temperature on approaching the lambda line @xcite .    near the bulk critical point",
    "the residual free energy density and casimir force are expected to have the scaling forms @xmath42 and @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 should be universal functions of @xmath8 .",
    "these expectations rest on the assumption that @xmath9 and @xmath2 are large compared to other lengths , which means , in particular , that the symmetry breaking field @xmath46 vanishes and long - range interactions are either absent or negligible .    in studies of the casimir effect in qed",
    ", matter usually is taken into account only through the choice of appropriate boundary conditions on the surfaces of macroscopic bodies .",
    "hence they involve _ free _ field theories under given boundary conditions .",
    "systematic theoretical investigations of the casimir effect at _ critical points _",
    "are a much greater challenge in that one has to deal with _ interacting _ field theories in finite and bounded systems @xcite .",
    "a first fairly detailed study of the thermodynamic casimir effect was made about 15 years ago by krech and dietrich ( kd ) for the @xmath47 theory on a slab @xmath48 $ ] of thickness @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "building on symanzik s work @xcite in the 80s and the simultaneously emerging field - theory approach to critical behavior of systems with boundaries @xcite , these authors considered five different boundary conditions @xmath49 , namely , periodic ( @xmath50 ) , antiperiodic ( @xmath51 ) , and the three nonequivalent combinations @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 of dirichlet ( @xmath55 ) and special ( @xmath56 ) boundary conditions on the slab s two boundary planes . here the former ( d ) means @xmath57 as usual , while the latter ( @xmath56 ) is the case of a robin boundary condition @xmath58 for which @xmath59 takes the special value @xmath60 corresponding to the critical enhancement of the surface interactions on the respective boundary plane .    restricting themselves to temperatures @xmath61 ,",
    "kd performed two - loop calculations for @xmath6 dimensional slabs under these boundary conditions @xmath49 and determined the @xmath62 expansions of the casimir amplitudes @xmath63 as well as those of the corresponding scaling functions @xmath64 to first order in @xmath62 .    in a recent paper with shpot @xcite",
    ", we have shown that conventional renormalization - group ( rg ) improved perturbation theory , on which both symanzik s @xcite and kd s @xcite analyses are based , becomes ill - defined at @xmath4 beyond two - loop order due to infrared singularities for those boundary conditions that involve a zero mode at @xmath4 in landau theory .",
    "this applies to both @xmath65 and @xmath66 . to remedy these deficiencies , we performed a reorganization of field theory such that the resulting rg - improved perturbation theory remained meaningful at @xmath4 .",
    "it was found that the small-@xmath62 expansions of the corresponding casimir amplitudes @xmath67 involve fractional powers @xmath68 , with @xmath69 , and powers of @xmath70 .",
    "furthermore , explicit results for these series to order @xmath71 were given .",
    "in this paper we will utilize this approach to compute the scaling functions @xmath64 , and hence @xmath72 , for @xmath65 and @xmath73 to the same order of rg - improved perturbation theory .",
    "the results are consistent with , and reproduce those of @xcite when @xmath39 .",
    "let us note that kd s two - loop results for these boundary conditions , though well - defined down to @xmath4 , gave clear indications of existing problems . to see this ,",

    "the former go through a minimum at small @xmath80 and then increase as @xmath14 .",
    "such a minimum is neither expected at @xmath80 nor in conformity with the monte carlo results of ref .",
    "@xcite and announced more recent ones @xcite .",
    "note also that as @xmath18 increases , the extrapolations actually move away from the exact @xmath77 curve since the deviations at small @xmath13 get bigger .",
    "a second problem was pointed to by kd : since for finite @xmath2 no phase transition takes place at @xmath4 , the free energy per unit area must be an analytic function of temperature at @xmath4 , which imposes conditions on the small-@xmath13 behavior of the scaling functions @xmath81 ( which will be recalled in sec .",
    "[ sec : genprop ] ) .",
    "kd found their @xmath76 results to be consistent with these conditions only in the considered cases of non - zero - mode boundary conditions @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 . in the remaining cases of the zero - mode boundary conditions @xmath65 and @xmath82 , these conditions turned out to be violated by terms of first order in @xmath62 .",
    "the results our approach yields for the scaling functions @xmath74 do better in two regards .",
    "first , the small-@xmath13 behavior is improved inasmuch as the casimir amplitudes @xmath83 are approached in a monotonically decreasing manner as @xmath10 .",
    "second , the order of the terms violating the analyticity condition is increased from @xmath76 to @xmath12 . in the case of sp - sp boundary conditions ,",
    "our results raise questions whose answers might require a generalization of our analysis in which the surface enhancement variables are allowed to vary . as we shall see , the one - loop expression for the scaling function of the inverse finite - size susceptibility becomes negative in a small interval of @xmath84 when evaluated at @xmath85 .",
    "this probably simply means that this extrapolation to @xmath15 is not sufficiently accurate . in any case , this violation of a necessary stability condition of the disordered phase is a problem even for kd s original @xmath76 results .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we specify the model utilized in our analysis  the @xmath47 theory in slab geometry .",
    "we briefly recapitulate the general fluctuating robin boundary conditions it involves , its renormalization , the fixed points that are relevant for the subsequent analysis , and the renormalization of its free energy . in sec .",
    "[ sec : revftapp ] we first recall the conventional theory of the casimir effect based on rg improved perturbation theory in @xmath6 bulk dimensions , and then discuss the problems into which it runs when a zero mode appears in landau theory .",

    "it became clear that the ill - definedness of the conventional @xmath62-expansion theory due to zero modes manifests itself already at two - loop order inasmuch as contributions found at this order were found to have no power - series expansion in @xmath62 at @xmath4 since they vary @xmath603 .    in calculations of crossover scaling functions by means of rg - improved perturbation theory near an upper critical dimension one",
    "usually is faced with the following problem .",
    "the rg commonly achieves the proper exponentiation of the infrared singularities only at the unstable fixed point .",
    "however , it does not normally do this  at least , not automatically  for the modified singularities that occur as the scaled crossover variable becomes large .",
    "knowledge about the corresponding asymptotic behavior frequently is obtained from other sources , such as rg analyses of a different model or fixed point , or short - distance expansion .",
    "representative examples are the calculation of the two - point correlation function @xcite , the crossover at a bicritical point @xcite , and the crossover from critical to goldstone - mode behavior in isotropic ferromagnets @xcite . to obtain and verify the correct singularities of the behavior to which the crossover occurs by means of the @xmath62 expansion",
    ", it must be supplemented by appropriate assumptions , or preferably knowledge , about the respective asymptotic forms . in some cases it has even been possible to design rg procedures that yield the correct asymptotic behaviors at both the unstable fixed point as well as the stable one to which the crossover occurs @xcite , albeit with somewhat limited range of applicability and success .",
    "similar problems evidently had to be expected in the study of the problems considered here  finite - size effects and thermodynamic casimir forces .",
    "however , the challenges are actually greater and the difficulties more severe .",
    "ideally , one would like to have a theory that has the power to correctly treat the infrared singularities at both the bulk critical point as well as the film critical point and moreover is capable of handling the corresponding dimensional crossover . for reasons discussed at the end of sec .",
    "[ sec : revftapp ] , such ambitious goals would be unrealistic for a theory based on an expansion about the upper critical dimension .",
    "we therefore set out to reach more modest goals , namely : to modify and correct the previous theory by an appropriate treatment of the zero mode in such a way that ( i ) rg - improved perturbation theory becomes well - defined for temperatures @xmath390 , ( ii ) reasonable scaling functions result whose limiting behavior complies with the theory s predictions directly at @xmath4 and can be extrapolated to @xmath15 dimensions , and ( iii ) hence bring it into a state comparable to the one it has for the non - zero - mode boundary conditions @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 .",
    "we feel that , on the whole , our results are encouraging , in particular , for the case of periodic boundary conditions , where besides achieving ( i)(iii ) , we were able to demonstrate consistency with the exact large-@xmath18 solution",
    ". moreover , the scaling function obtained by extrapolation to @xmath15 , at least in the one - component case , appears to agree reasonably well with monte carlo results @xcite .",
    "the case of sp - sp boundary conditions turned out to be more delicate .",
    "first of all , we found that the one - loop expression for the scaling function @xmath497 of the inverse finite - size susceptibility becomes negative in a small regime of @xmath84 when @xmath62 exceeds the value @xmath604 ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : r ] and [ fig : rspvareps ] ) .",
    "this tells us that all extrapolations of free - energy scaling functions and casimir forces to @xmath15 based on approximations which yield the same one - loop scaling function @xmath497 are questionable , at least in the regime where the positivity condition @xmath605 is violated .",
    "this applies both to kd s original extrapolation and ours ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : thetaspn1d3 ] ) .",
    "our investigation of this case also revealed another problem : perturbative rg calculations do not necessarily yield the correct asymptotic large-@xmath13 behavior , at least not automatically .",
    "this applies even for the conventional @xmath62 expansion in cases where no zero mode is present inasmuch as the algebraic prefactors @xmath606 appearing in the asymptotic exponential behaviors of @xmath461 and @xmath464 given in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : thetaperlargeas ] ) and ( [ eq : thetasplargeas ] ) , respectively , are obtained only in @xmath62-expanded form .",
    "however , it is more troublesome in the cases studied here , especially , for @xmath66 .",
    "the reason may be understood as follows .",
    "on the one hand , we encountered powers of inverse finite - size susceptibilities we had to retain to ensure consistency with the behavior at @xmath4 . on the other hand , by expanding other contributions in @xmath62 , @xmath13-dependent terms of order @xmath607 and higher are dropped which may be needed to cancel similar @xmath13-dependent contributions originating from the unexpanded powers of @xmath608 in order to avoid incorrect or even divergent large-@xmath13 behavior of the scaling functions .",
    "a qualitative difference between periodic and sp - sp boundary conditions is that the latter involve , even in the semi - infinite case @xmath609 , both @xmath1- and @xmath610-dimensional critical behavior , rather than just a dimensional crossover .",
    "with hindsight it is therefore perhaps not too surprising that the latter turned out to be the more difficult case .",
    "as remarked earlier , special surface transitions are expected to occur in three bulk dimensions only in the @xmath16 case . when @xmath611 , anisotropic special transitions should be possible if the continuous @xmath0 symmetry is broken by an appropriate easy - axis spin anisotropy at the surface @xcite .",
    "this is because surface phases with long - range order should not be thermodynamically stable at temperatures @xmath612 , by analogy with the mermin - wagner theorem @xcite .",
    "however , the @xmath613 case is exceptional in that a surface phase with quasi - long - range order should be possible .",
    "in fact , recent monte carlo work @xcite indicated that the surface phase transition is of kosterlitz - thouless type .",
    "thus a multicritical surface - bulk point at which the line of these surface transitions reaches @xmath4 should exist as well @xcite , and was reported to be found in the cited monte carlo analyses .",
    "since the lambda transition of helium involves a ( real - valued ) two - component order parameter , this @xmath613 case is of potential relevance for casimir forces in confined liquid he . in the case of @xmath614he-@xmath41he mixtures in contact with a substrate ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , @xmath41he usually gets enriched near the wall and a superfluid surface film may form there . since order - parameter correlations decay",
    "algebraically in it , the bulk transition in the presence of such a critical surface phase is reminiscent of the special transition .",
    "whether the central issue we were concerned with in this work  the presence of zero modes in landau theory  arises also in the study of the thermodynamic casimir effect in such systems and what its consequences are remains to be seen .",
    "a proper analysis of this question requires generalizations of our model . to describe mixtures , a second density besides the order parameter is needed .",
    "in addition , care must be taken to ensure a proper description of the kosterlitz - thouless - like surface transition .",
    "the present work suggests extensions and complementary work along several lines .",
    "the situation in the case of sp - sp boundary conditions is rather unsatisfactory . to improve it",
    ", it would be desirable to extend our analysis by allowing the surface enhancement variables @xmath213 to vary .",
    "in fact , in order to clarify the effects of finite size on the phase diagram , and in turn resolve the issue in which range of parameters the disordered state is thermodynamically stable , such a generalization appears to be unavoidable .",
    "an appealing other aspect of it would be that by varying the @xmath213 , one could smoothly interpolate between the boundary conditions @xmath317 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 .    in view of the great technical and conceptual difficulties one",
    "is faced with in such analytical approaches , we believe that careful checks of their predictions by alternative means such as monte carlo simulations are absolutely necessary . for a long time detailed studies of the thermodynamic casimir effect by this method existed only for the case of periodic boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "however , recently new simulation strategies for investigating this effect in lattice spin systems with free boundary conditions have been developed @xcite . as a result ,",
    "systematic numerical studies of the thermodynamic casimir effect under all sorts of interesting boundary conditions have become possible .",
    "on the side of analytical theories , it would be interesting to explore whether the present approach can be combined with existing rg approaches at fixed dimension @xmath1 for the study of bulk and surface critical phenomena @xcite .",
    "another important challenge is to develop reliable analytical approaches by which the casimir effect can be investigated below the bulk and film critical temperatures .",
    "recent investigations of the ordered phase based on landau theory or rg - improved landau theory @xcite certainly should not remain the final word since they fail to give correct descriptions of the critical behavior at both the bulk critical point as well as at eventual film critical points .",
    "in addition , they are known to be sometimes even qualitatively wrong inasmuch as they may predict phases with long - range order that can be shown to be destroyed by thermal fluctuations .",
