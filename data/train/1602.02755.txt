    "three lines of evidence suggest that , at all redshifts , there is a deep connection between star formation rates in galaxies , and the presence and properties of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) in their centres .",
    "first , there is a strong similarity in the evolution of comoving luminosity density of agn and star formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for agn , the optical luminosity function of quasars plateaus between @xmath9 ( e.g. * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for star formation , the comoving star formation rate density increases by a factor of at least ten over @xmath10 ( e.g. * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , peaks at @xmath11 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and then declines at higher redshifts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "second , there is a positive relationship between stellar and supermassive black hole ( hereafter just black hole ) mass in quiescent galaxies , with more massive black holes being found in systems with , on average , a higher bulge stellar mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "finally , observations find luminous star formation and agn in the same galaxies at rates significantly higher than expected by chance ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the scaling relations , or lack thereof , between star formation rates and agn properties as a function of variables such as redshift , luminosity , stellar mass and environment , are fundamental to understanding the nature of this connection , and by extension to understanding the mass assembly history of galaxies throughout the history of the universe .",
    "the existence and nature of such scaling relations give insights into how initially free baryons are converted into stars and black holes , and how these conversions are affected by factors such as free gas availability .",
    "they also give insights into more apparent manifestations of this connection , such as the idea that star formation and agn activity can directly affect each other .",
    "one example of this is ` agn quenching ' , where winds or jets from an agn curtail star formation in its host galaxy on timescales much shorter than gas depletion timescales ( see e.g. @xcite for a review ) .",
    "agn quenching is motivated both by models @xcite , which in many cases require quenching to bring their predictions in line with observations , and by some observations that find massive outflows of gas that are plausibly linked to both agn winds , and reductions in star formation rates @xcite .",
    "another example is the suggestion that , in some circumstances , the agn can trigger star formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this paper",
    "we explore the connection between agn activity and star formation in optically luminous type 1 quasars at @xmath1 .",
    "we choose this class of object since they are straightforward to find , correspond to a specific stage in the agn duty cycle , and reside at the epoch where the comoving luminosity density arising from both star formation and agn activity is expected to peak .",
    "we assemble our sample from the sloan digital sky survey , restricted to fields with high quality far - infrared imaging , from which we derive star formation rates .",
    "we compare host star formation rates to the properties of the agn as derived from the sdss data to see how star formation rates depend on agn properties across the quasar population .",
    "we adopt ab magnitudes , and assume a spatially flat cosmology with @xmath12 and @xmath13 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 .     plane showing both all sdss dr9 quasars in stripe 82 with uniform flag @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( grey points ) , and our sample of quasars ( red points ) .",
    "the distributions of the red and grey points are identical by visual inspection , and indistinguishable via a k - s test (  [ ssectsample]).,scaledwidth=47.0% ]",
    "we selected our sample from the baryonic oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ) , itself part of the sloan digital sky survey data release 9 quasar catalogue ( sdss dr9q , @xcite ) . by selecting from boss",
    ", we can assemble the necessary number of quasars to subdivide into multiple bins based on various criteria , and still have sufficient objects per bin to perform stacking analyses ( see  [ bossanalysis ] ) .",
    "we start with the 61,931 sdss dr9 quasars at @xmath16 .",
    "our selection comprises four steps .",
    "first , we excluded all boss quasars that did not lie within stripe 82 .",
    "this left 9,520 objects .",
    "second , we excluded all quasars with a uniform flag of zero or below , leaving only those with a uniform flag of 1 or 2 .",
    "the remaining quasars are the core quasar selection within boss .",
    "the core selection is both homogeneous and uniform , and is highly , but not entirely complete over the range @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "we discuss the issue of completeness further in  [ caveatsoi ] .",
    "this step left 6,516 objects .",
    "third , we excluded all quasars at @xmath18 and @xmath19 , leaving 3,256 objects .",
    "fourth , we excluded quasars that lie outside or within 20 pixels of the edge of the hers and/or helms data (  [ ssectfirdata ] ) , so that there were sufficient pixels in the stacked images to allow for clustering corrections (  [ ssectstack ] ) .",
    "the pixel sizes differ for each band , with the largest being for @xmath20 m .",
    "we therefore used the @xmath20 m image for this step , which left 1,002 objects",
    ". our selection does not include steps to remove either broad absorption line ( bal ) quasars , or sources with radio data .",
    "the effects of this decision are described in  [ caveatsiii ] .",
    "we checked how our sample compared to all of the sdss boss quasars within stripe 82 .",
    "the absolute @xmath21 band magnitudes as functions of redshift of the two samples are qualitatively identical ( fig .",
    "[ fig : zimagcomp ] ) . a ks test yields a p - value of 0.685 ; high enough to accept the null hypothesis that they are from the same parent population . comparing their sdss colours ( fig . [",
    "fig : colorcomp ] ) again gives qualitatively identical distributions , and @xmath22-values high enough to accept that they are drawn from the same parent population ( @xmath23 in all cases ) .",
    "their redshift distributions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : zhist ] ) show no differences , and yield a @xmath22-value of 0.86 .",
    "we repeated these tests with the hers and helms fields separately , and found no significant differences .",
    "we conclude that our sample is representative of the sdss boss stripe 82 quasar population at @xmath15 .",
    "we assembled far - infrared imaging data from the _ herschel _ stripe 82 survey ( hers ; @xcite ) and the hermes large - mode survey ( helms ; @xcite , map version 0.2 ) .",
    "both surveys were performed using the spectral and photometeric imaging receiver instrument ( spire ; @xcite ) onboard the _ herschel _ space observatory @xcite , in the @xmath24 m , @xmath25 m and @xmath20 m bands . both of the surveys form part of the _ herschel _ multi - tiered extragalactic survey ( hermes ; @xcite ) .",
    "helms cover 270 deg@xmath26 and hers covers 79 deg@xmath26 , with an overlap between the two of @xmath27 deg@xmath26 .",
    "the hers and helms surveys together cover 115 of the 255 deg@xmath26 sdss stripe 82 field @xcite .",

    "so we assume that hibals have indistinguishable far - infrared properties from the general quasar population , which is reasonable based on previous results @xcite .",
    "an even smaller fraction ( 1.9% ) have radio data , and it is likely that many of these objects are radio - loud .",
    "however , we have not excluded these objects from our samples .",
    "we here explore the effects of these decisions .",
    "both the bal quasars and the quasars with radio data have identical ( within the errors ) distributions in redshift and absolute magnitude as the rest of the sample .",
    "however , previous papers have shown that both bal and radio - loud quasars differ in other respects from classical quasars .",
    "the radio detected quasars comprise less than 4% of the quasars in virtually all the stacks .",
    "even if all these quasars are radio - loud , it is unlikely that their inclusion has a significant effect .",
    "the bal quasars on the other hand , while comprising less than 10% of the quasars in most stacks , are in a few cases over 15% .",
    "we thus investigated the impact of bal quasars on our results by repeating the stacking analyses with the bal quasars removed .",
    "two examples , for redshift and @xmath7 , are shown in fig . [",
    "fig : zevonobalcomp ] .",
    "a further example is shown in fig . [ fig : sfr_color ] . in no case",
    "did we find any significant differences , either in terms of mean values or shapes of trends .",
    "we conclude that neither the bal or radio - loud objects in our sample are significantly affecting the trends we observe .",
    "our results provide insight on both the evolution with redshift of star formation rates in quasar host galaxies , and on the relationship between star formation and agn activity , at @xmath15 . by stacking _ herschel _",
    "spire photometry for a sample of 1002 optically selected quasars , we examine _ typical _ star formation rates in high redshift , optically luminous , unobscured agn , rather than individually detected objects that represent the more extreme star formation events .",
    "however , because we require a minimum of 20 objects per bin to achieve robust detections , we can investigate at most 10 - 12 bins in total , so we can not reliably explore degeneracies in relationships between parameters .",
    "moreover , when discussing relationships between star formation rate and line properties , we assume that the line arises exclusively from the agn .",
    "we find no evidence for strong evolution of star formation rates in quasar hosts with redshift across @xmath15 .",
    "instead , we find an approximately constant mean star formation rate of @xmath2yr@xmath3 .",
    "our mean rate is higher than the star formation rates seen in @xmath28 agn @xcite , but lower than those found in far - infrared luminous ( i.e. individually detected ) quasars at similar redshifts @xcite . finally ,",
    "if the stellar masses of the host galaxies are of order @xmath29m@xmath30 then our mean rate lies on or somewhat above the ` main sequence ' star formation rate at @xmath11 @xcite    the simplest interpretation of this result , together with the relatively flat comoving star formation and quasar luminosity densities over @xmath31 , is that the processes that trigger quasars evolve in a similar way to the processes that trigger star formation .",
    "furthermore , it is consistent with the bulk of star formation in quasar hosts at this epoch not being in the ` starburst ' mode @xcite .",
    "however , further interpretation depends on the quasar host masses .",
    "there is evidence that , at @xmath32 , the @xmath33 ratio is higher than at low redshift ( that is , the hosts of high redshift quasars are less massive than low redshift quasars for the same black hole mass ) , though the redshift _ and _ luminosity evolution of this ratio remain uncertain @xcite",
    ". there also exists a wide range in stellar mass for a given star formation rate at @xmath32 ; our mean star formation rate spans a range of over 1 dex in stellar mass @xcite .",
    "since we have no measures of the host galaxy masses , we can not make further inferences from the flat star formation rate relation .",
    "the factor of @xmath34 rise in @xmath0 from @xmath35 to @xmath36 is not straightforward to explain .",
    "this @xmath37 corresponds to @xmath38gyr , a factor of a few longer than the quasar duty cycle @xcite .",
    "however , the ( rest - frame ultraviolet ) galaxy luminosity function does not evolve substantially over @xmath1 @xcite . using a schechter function",
    "then @xmath39 and @xmath40 change little over this redshift range , while @xmath41 may change somewhat more @xcite .",
    "a factor of @xmath34 change in @xmath0 over @xmath42 could thus plausibly have a physical origin , related to the masses of galaxies in which quasar activity is triggered .",
    "it is however also plausible that this rise is due to an unaccounted for effect in the selection of the dr9 quasar catalog .",
    "the @xmath7 values in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfr_imag ] can be converted into a bolometric accretion luminosity @xmath43 via :    @xmath44}\\ ] ]    ( see also @xcite , their equation 4 ) where @xmath45 is the correction from @xmath46 at 2500 .",
    "this leads to the @xmath47 relation shown in fig .",

    "[ lbolsfr ] is also the form of the relation between @xmath0 and @xmath5 .    fig .",
    "[ fig : sfr_lbol ] and eq .",
    "[ lbolsfr ] are consistent with the idea that there may be a ` maximal ' _ typical _ star formation rate in optically selected type 1 quasar hosts of @xmath52m@xmath30 yr@xmath3 , beyond which star formation rates do not rise with increasing accretion rate .",
    "below this value ( i.e. neglecting the last point in fig .",

    "[ eqnlaccmbh ] yields    @xmath54    a maximal star formation rate is consistent with the idea that star formation rates in quasar hosts ( at least in the domain examined here ) ` saturate ' at high luminosity , perhaps due to supernova winds ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "however , the _ existence _ of a correlation below this value is more controversial .",
    "our finding of a correlation is consistent with some previous studies on quasars , obscured agn and star - forming galaxies , although most of these studies sample lower @xmath43 and @xmath55 ranges ( e.g * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* )    to uncover the origin of this contrast , we consider the ways in which our study differs from previous work ; we sample higher agn luminosities , we have more objects at @xmath57 , and we infer relationships via stacking , rather than individual detections .",
    "these three differences mean that there are three possible reasons why we see a relationship between @xmath0 and @xmath5 , while some other studies have not .",
    "the first is that an @xmath58 relation only emerges at high redshift , around @xmath59 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "a motivation for this possibility is that the total free gas to stellar mass fraction , @xmath60 , rises with redshift as @xmath61 up to at least @xmath62 , and may plateau at @xmath63 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "other studies have suggested that systems with higher @xmath60 are more likely to have higher star formation rates , and that there is a strong connection between available cold gas and the probability that a black hole is accreting rapidly ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this possibility would explain the emergence of trends in our study , which ( some ) previous studies did not find .",
    "it is also consistent with the idea that both star formation and black hole accretion depend on the availability of free baryons .",
    "the second is that short - term ( @xmath64myr ) agn variability introduces scatter in the @xmath58 relation derived from measurements of objects individually .",
    "this possibility has been suggested both from simulations @xcite and observations @xcite .",
    "since we stack large numbers of objects together , any reasonable level of agn variability would be averaged out .",
    "this possibility could thus also explain the contrast between our results and previous work .",
    "the third is that an @xmath58 relation only emerges at high @xmath43 , around @xmath65l@xmath30 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "a motivation for this possibility is that black hole growth may correlate with star formation on @xmath66sub - kpc scales , but not with star formation on @xmath67kpc scales ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if , at high @xmath43 , star formation in quasar hosts shifted to smaller spatial scales ( perhaps because of a higher fraction of merger - triggered rather than secular star formation ) , then the emergence of a @xmath58 relation in our sample is natural .",
    "this explanation is however not wholly satisfactory .",
    "it is in tension with the studies of lower luminosity agn that do find a correlation , and with studies of quasar hosts with extremely high star formation rates that do not find a strong @xmath58 relation @xcite .",
    "we can not discriminate between these three possibilities , as to do so requires a larger sample , and x - ray data .",
    "we thus speculate , based on our results and previous work , that a correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath5 exists in certain parts of the @xmath68 parameter space , dependent on the availability of free baryons , the trigger for activity ( major mergers , secular processes , etc ) , the potential positive and negative effects of agn on star formation .",
    "moreover , the form of the correlation - how strong it is , how non - linear it is - also may vary based on the same factors .      fig .",
    "[ fig : sfr_fwhmciv ] is consistent with the idea that higher star formation rates are found in quasars with more massive black holes .",
    "the data in @xcite preclude an optimal calculation of black hole mass , but the @xmath7 values sample the rest - frame uv (  [ ssectstack ] and @xcite ) .",
    "we thus estimate black hole masses by converting the @xmath7 values to a monochromatic luminosity at 1450  ( @xmath69 ) using equation 3 of @xcite and then use these luminosities and the @xmath70 values to compute @xmath50 via equation 7 of @xcite .",
    "we performed the stacking in two ways ; stacking directly on black hole mass , and calculating the mean black hole masses for each bin in fig .",

    ", we estimated @xmath69 from the sdss @xmath74-band magnitudes using the same spectral index , and then used these data to compute @xmath50 .",
    "the resulting fit was virtually identical to that obtained by using @xmath7 .",
    "we also checked the effect on these results if the quasars with high @xmath75 or high @xmath76 values were removed from the stacks .",
    "for @xmath75 we removed those objects in the last bin in fig .",

    "[ eqnsmbhsfr ] is expected .",
    "we now address the question ; do star formation rates in quasar hosts scale with black hole mass , black hole accretion rate , or both ? given the limitations of our data we can only address this question in a simple way . if @xmath0 scaled solely with @xmath5 then we would not expect to see a strong @xmath82 relation , but we clearly do . if however @xmath0 scaled solely with @xmath50 , via e.g. @xmath83 , then we would expect @xmath82 and @xmath84 relations that were both power laws , which is what we find .",
    "thus , our results are consistent with star formation rates in quasar hosts scaling with black hole mass .",
    "we find no evidence that favours an additional ( i.e. beyond that implied by eq .",
    "[ mbhscalerel ] ) scaling between @xmath0 and @xmath5 .",
    "this is consistent with a common gas reservoir fueling both the growth of the black hole and star formation , such that a larger ( or more optimally distributed ) reservoir leads to both a larger black hole and higher star formation rates .",
    "this scaling relation would manifest on timescales of @xmath85  myr , comparable to both the lifetime of a starburst , and the quasar duty cycle .",
    "we thus cautiously propose that the scaling between @xmath0 and @xmath50 is the most important one for understanding the relationship between black hole mass and stellar mass in quasar hosts .",
    "this idea though depends on the starburst ` saturating ' so as to allow eq .",
    "[ lbolsfr ] to be interpreted as we do .",
    "we can not , however , rule out a separate relation between @xmath0 and @xmath5 .",
    "there is room within the uncertainties on the scaling relations between @xmath0 and both @xmath77 and @xmath86 such that we can have a relation between @xmath0 and @xmath86 as implied by a @xmath83 relation , and an additional dependence on @xmath86 .",
    "such a dependence could be driven on timescales comparable to those required for significant change in @xmath5 , of order tens of myr .",
    "these processes could include how efficiently gas is channeled into the @xmath87kpc regions of the host , thus regulating both @xmath88 and @xmath5 .",
    "two related points are worth noting .",
    "first , some authors have argued that is a worse tracer of @xmath50 at high luminosities than or h@xmath89 @xcite .",
    "possible sources of contamination could include the emission arising from greater distances than the other lines , and/or significant non - virial motions .",
    "however , the overall scaling between @xmath70 and @xmath50 has been argued to be reliable @xcite . moreover , excluding the objects with highly asymmetric lines does not appreciably change the relation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sfr_smbh2 ] ) .",
    "we conclude that the lines , at least for a study like ours which averages over tens of objects , is a reasonable way to obtain black hole masses .",
    "second , there is controversy over the relation between accretion rate and black hole mass ; @xcite find no correlation of @xmath90 ( in which @xmath91 is the eddington luminosity ) with @xmath50 , while @xcite do , albeit with a large scatter .",
    "the @xmath92 $ ] variable is a crude measure ( i.e. using broad filters , and without accounting for the contribution from lines ) of the uv continuum slope over @xmath1 , spanning ( 1500-1200)/(2500-1900 ) .",
    "there is evidence that the uv continua of quasars become bluer with increasing bolometric luminosity ( @xcite , but also @xcite ) , so the positive correlation of @xmath92 $ ] with star formation rate in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfr_color ] is plausibly a manifestation of the relation with @xmath7 in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfr_imag ] . the possible turnover at the most positive @xmath92 $ ] values _ could _ be a separate , evolutionary effect , namely low star formation rates in slightly dust - reddened quasars in a post - starburst phase .",
    "there may also be a rise in @xmath93 with increasing @xmath92 $ ] ( the red line in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfr_color ] ) , which could suggest an agn origin for part of the infrared emission .",
    "we do not however regard this as likely , for the reasons given in ",
    "[ measrates ] and  [ caveats ] . instead ,",
    "if this rise is real , we interpret it as a larger fraction of the total output arising from star formation .",
    "assuming opacity via thompson scattering through hydrogen , the eddington ratio , @xmath94 , of a quasar is given by :    @xmath95    in which @xmath91 is the eddington luminosity , @xmath96 is the thompson scattering cross - section for the electron , and @xmath97 is the mass of the proton .",
    "bolometric luminosities are calculated from eq .",
    "[ lbolmi ] .",
    "this examination has the caveat that the resulting @xmath94 distribution is skewed towards values at @xmath98 , so , to ensure enough objects per bin to obtain reasonable error bars , we place most of the bins at @xmath99 , with only a few at higher values .    the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfr_eddrat ] .",
    "there is , ostensibly , a trend ; low @xmath94 values mostly correspond to higher star formation rates than do high @xmath94 values .",
    "the uneven , sparse binning means however that we can not be certain of this , as the data are also consistent with a flat relationship with a mean that is approximately the same as the mean star formation rate with redshift in fig .",

    "it is however informative to speculate on the opposite case , that the hint of a trend of low @xmath94 values corresponding to higher star formation rates is real .",
    "there are two straightforward interpretations .",

    "a rise in the number of optical photons is met with a relative decrease in the number of x - ray photons that can _ produce _ , meaning that @xmath7 rises as @xmath75 declines .",

    "fourth is that this is evidence for quenching of star formation by the agn ; if the ew of is a proxy for the radiant intensity available to drive winds into the host then large ews would signpost the _ population _ of quasars in which the agn could exert maximal influence on star formation .",
    "the first , second , and third candidates seem plausible , but we lack the data to confirm or refute them .",
    "the fourth possibility is also , at face value , plausible , since we find lower star formation rates for the highest @xmath75 values compared to the lowest @xmath7 values .",
    "we do not however regard it as a likely contributor .",
    "assuming a two component disk+wind model , then a high x - ray luminosity will suppress a line - driven wind by over - ionizing the gas in the belr .",
    "furthermore , strongly blueshifted is associated with weaker x - ray spectra , and quasars with high @xmath75 and highly blueshifted are depopulated in sdss dr9 @xcite . the only way ( within the above framework ) that quenching could contribute",
    "is if the wind is disk - launched , and having the continuum filtered though a more ionized continuum makes a more powerful outflow more likely .",
    "we have stacked _ herschel _ spire data on the positions of 1002 optically selected type 1 quasars with @xmath109 spanning @xmath15 .",
    "we used the resulting flux densities at 250 , 350 and 500 @xmath110 m to infer star formation rates as a function of redshift , black hole accretion rate , black hole mass , eddington ratio , optical color , and line asymmetry .",
    "our conclusions are :    1 - star formation rates in quasar hosts remain approximately constant with redshift across @xmath15 , at @xmath2yr@xmath3 .",
    "this is consistent with the processes that trigger quasars evolving in a similar way to the processes that trigger star formation .",
    "there is a rise in mean star formation rate from @xmath35 to @xmath36 , which could be connected to evolution in the mass of the quasar hosts , but could also be due to selection effects in the dr9 catalog .",
    "2 - higher rates of star formation are seen in more uv - luminous quasars , consistent with higher star formation rates correlating with higher accretion rates .",
    "we obtain the following relation between star formation rate and bolometric accretion luminosity    @xmath111^{-1}\\ ] ]    this is consistent with a ` maximal ' _ typical _ star formation rate of @xmath52m@xmath30 yr@xmath3 , in quasar hosts , perhaps due to saturation of the starburst by supernova winds . at lower",
    "star formation rates the relation between @xmath0 and black hole accretion rate is consistent with a power law with index @xmath112 ; a linear fit gives :    @xmath113    the existence of such a correlation in our study , when some previous studies have found no correlation , can be explained via a combination of two factors .",
    "first , that an @xmath58 becomes stronger with increasing redshift , especially around @xmath59 , corresponding to an epoch with a higher free gas fraction .",
    "second , that short - term ( @xmath114myr ) agn variability introduces scatter in the @xmath47 relation derived from measurements of objects individually , but which is averaged out in our stacking analyses .",
    "it is also plausible that very high or very low star formation rates and black hole accretion rates may not correlate with each other .",
    "this implies that a correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath5 exists in certain parts of the @xmath68 parameter space , dependent on the availability of free baryons , the trigger for activity , and the potential positive and negative effects of agn on star formation .",
    "3 - higher rates of star formation are seen in quasars with more massive black holes . assuming a relation of the form @xmath115 and allowing slope and intercept to vary then an index of @xmath116 fits the data . further assuming that @xmath117 , and with the dependencies on @xmath68 parameter space noted above ,",
    "then our results are consistent with star formation rates in quasars scaling with black hole mass .",
    "an additional , separate scaling with accretion rate is possible , but our results do not require it .",
    "a plausible physical origin is that star formation rates and black hole mass are both driven by the available gas reservoir .",
    "4 - we see no clear relationship between star formation rate and eddington ratio .",
    "there is a possibility that higher star formation rates are seen in systems with lower eddington ratios , but the data are consistent with a flat relation .",
    "a flat relation is straightforward to understand if the underlying driver is the relation between star formation rate and black hole mass , since there would no reason to expect a relation between star formation rate and how _ efficiently _ the black hole is accreting .",
    "if however low @xmath94 values do correspond to higher star formation rates , then this may be due to smaller mass black holes accreting more efficiently , and/or that the peak star formation rate occurs some time before the peak in the agn luminosity .    5 - we see no clear relation between star formation rate and the asymmetry of the line .",
    "this relation is consistent with the idea that line asymmetries arise due to the relative orientation of the quasar ; assuming that the infrared emission from star formation is optically thin then variations in line asymmetry would be accompanied by no net variation in star formation rate .",
    "there are two deviations from this flat relation , one consistent with agn winds quenching star formation and one consistent with triggering , but both deviations are barely significant .    6 - there is a decline in star formation rate with rising ew .",
    "the rise in star formation rate with rest - frame uv - luminosity suggests that part of this decline is a symptom of the baldwin effect , but the dynamic range in star formation rate with ew is wider than the dynamic range in star formation rate with @xmath118 .",
    "the most plausible explanation for this additional dynamic range is a contribution from three factors .",
    "first is that @xmath7 is not a linear tracer of l@xmath8 .",
    "second is that the baldwin effect changes form at high @xmath86 .",
    "third is that high ew values signpost a change in the scaling relation between @xmath0 and @xmath5 .",
