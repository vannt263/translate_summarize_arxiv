    "factorization of linear second order differential equations is a well established method to find exact solutions through algebraic procedures .",
    "it was widely used in quantum mechanics and developed since schrodinger s works on the factorization of the sturm - liouville equation . at the present time ,",
    "very good informative reviews on the factorization method can be found in open literature ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "however , in recent times the factorization method has been applied to find exact solutions of nonlinear ordinary differential equations ( ode ) @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "based on previous berkovich s works @xcite , it has been provided a systematic way to apply the factorization method to nonlinear second order ode . in @xcite , wang and",
    "li extended the application to more complex nonlinear second and third order ode .",
    "the factorization of some ode may be restricted due to constraints which appear in a natural way within the factorization procedure .",
    "however , here it is shown that by performing transformation of coordinates , one can be able to get exact parametric solutions of an ode which does not allow its factorization or presents cumbersome constraints .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to apply the factorization method to study the full causal bulk viscous cosmological model with flat frw symmetries . since the misner @xcite suggestion stressing the fact that the observed large scale isotropy of the universe may be due to the action of the neutrino viscosity when the universe was about one second old ,",
    "there have been numerous works pointing out the importance of the physical processes involving viscous effects in the evolution of the universe ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "due to such assumption , dissipative processes are supposed to play a fundamental role in the evolution of the early universe .",
    "the theory of relativistic dissipative fluids , created by eckart @xcite and landau and lifshitz @xcite has many drawbacks , and it is known that it is incorrect in several respects mainly those concerning causality and stability .",
    "israel @xcite formulates a new theory in order to solve these drawbacks .",
    "this theory was latter developed by israel and stewart @xcite into what is called transient or extended irreversible thermodynamics .",
    "the best currently available theory for analyzing dissipative processes in the universe is the full causal thermodynamics developed by israel and stewart @xcite , hiscock and lindblom @xcite and hiscock and salmonson @xcite .",
    "the full causal bulk viscous thermodynamics has been extensively used to study the evolution of the early universe and some astrophysical process @xcite .",

    "ii , we start by reviewing the main components of a flat bulk viscous frw cosmological model , and introduce the factorization technique as applied to the cosmological model .",

    "this equation is transformed into a nonlinear first order ode .",
    "the order reduction of the equation for the hubble rate allows to find a variety of new exact parametric solutions of the fe for the viscous frw cosmological model .",
