    "the doping evolution of the electronic properties of lightly - doped cuprates have attracted considerable interest because of their fundamental importance in the context of both physics near mott transition and mechanism of superconductivity .. in the cuprates , in particular , the phase competition and the nature of the competing phases in the underdoped region have provided major experimental and theoretical challenges .",
    "angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) studies of lightly - doped la@xmath4sr@xmath5cuo@xmath6 ( lsco )  @xcite have shown that a sharp dispersive quasi - particle ( qp ) peak crosses the fermi level ( @xmath7 ) in the nodal @xmath8 = ( 0,0)-(@xmath9,@xmath9 ) direction , which explains their metallic behavior  @xcite and that the other part of the fermi surface around ( @xmath9,0 ) is gapped or pseudo - gapped , resulting in an `` arc '' of the fermi surface around the nodal direction . a remnant of the lower hubbard band ( lhb ) ( or the polaronic side band  @xcite ) persists at @xmath10(0.4 - 0.6 ) ev as the qp peak appears near @xmath7 .",
    "as holes are further doped , spectral weight is transferred from the `` lhb '' to the qp peak  @xcite .",

    "these observations are consistent with the pinning of the chemical potential in lsco and the rapid chemical potential shift in na - ccoc , bi2201 and bi2212 as implied by core - level x - ray photoemission spectroscopy ( xps )  @xcite .",
    "recent in - plane transport studies of yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 ( ybco ) have revealed their metallic behavior ( @xmath13 ) at high temperatures even in the lightly - doped `` insulating '' region as in the case of lsco  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath7 crossing of qp peak in the nodal direction has been observed in lightly - doped  @xcite as well as in underdoped to overdoped ybco  @xcite .",

    "arpes studies of ybco have not been advanced compared to those of other high-@xmath14 cuprates because intense surface - state signals near @xmath7 mask the bulk electronic states around the x [ = ( @xmath9,0 ) ] and y [ = ( 0,@xmath9 ) ] points in the brillouin zone .",

    "<S> we have performed an angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) study of lightly - doped to underdoped yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 ( ybco ) untwinned single crystals and a core - level x - ray photoemission spectroscopy ( xps ) study of ybco single and polycrystals . in the zone diagonal ( nodal ) direction , dispersive quasi - particle ( qp ) features crossing the fermi level were observed down to the hole concentration of @xmath3 , which explains the metallic transport of the lightly - doped ybco . </S>",
    "<S> the chemical potential shift estimated from xps was more rapid than in the bi2212 cuprates . upon hole doping , very rapid spectral weight transfer from high binding energies to the qp feature , </S>",
    "<S> even faster than la@xmath4sr@xmath5cuo@xmath6 , was observed . </S>"
