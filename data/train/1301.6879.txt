    "in a control system setting , balanced truncation is a well known technique for model reduction",
    ". introduced by @xcite , gramian matrices were employed to determine controllability and observability of linear systems . from these gramians a balancing transformation can be computed , enabling the truncation , for example , of states that are neither controllable nor observable .    with @xcite ,",
    "empirical ( controllability and observability ) gramians were introduced , which correspond to the analytical gramians for linear systems , while extending the concept of system gramians to nonlinear systems which are generally given by : @xmath0 with the system function @xmath1 and output function @xmath2 of states @xmath3 , input @xmath4 and parameters @xmath5 . in the special case of an unparametrized linear system @xmath6 and @xmath7 , these empirical gramians are computed by averaging simulations or experimental data with perturbations in inputs and initial states .",
    "the * emgr * framework presented here encompasses six empirical gramians , namely the controllability , observability , cross , sensitivity , identifiability and joint gramian . to adapt the computation of empirical gramians to the operating setting of the system , the initial state and the input are the main parameters which are perturbed by rotations and scaling .",
    "the sets of rotations provided are @xmath8 ( unit matrix ) and @xmath9 ( negative unit matrix and unit matrix ) .",
    "though these are very basic sets , and thus might not reflect all dynamics , especially with interrelated states and parameters , they allow a very efficient gramian assembly .",
    "scales may be freely chosen .",
    "the subdivision of the scales may be linear , logarithmic or geometric .",
    "finally , there are several options to average against : the arithmetic average @xcite , the median , a steady state @xcite , and additionally , the principal components of the simulations or data via a proper orthogonal decomposition ( pod ) .",
    "concerned with the reduction of states , the controllability , observability and cross gramian are presented next ; followed by the sensitivity , identifiability and joint gramian , which are used for parameter and combined reduction . for the purpose of defining the gramians ,",
    "a linear time - invariant control system is assumed : @xmath10 with the states @xmath11 , control or input @xmath12 , output @xmath13 , system matrix @xmath14 , input matrix @xmath15 and output matrix @xmath16 .",
    "the necessary perturbations are given by six sets , of which @xmath17 define the input perturbations , while sets @xmath18 define the initial state perturbations : @xmath19 these sets should correspond to the ranges in inputs and initial states the system is operating in .",
    "controllability is a quantification of how well a state can be driven by input .",
    "analytically , the controllability gramian is given by the smallest semi - positive definite solution of the lyapunov equation : @xmath20 .",
    "if the underlying system is asymptotically stable , the controllability gramian can also be defined using the linear input - to - state map : @xmath21 following @xcite , the empirical controllability gramian is defined by :     + for sets @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , input @xmath25 and input during the steady state @xmath26 , @xmath27 , the * empirical controllability gramian * is given by : @xmath28 with @xmath29 being the states for the input configuration @xmath30 .",
    "originally , in @xcite , @xmath25 was restricted to @xmath31 , but extended in @xcite to arbitrary input under the name empirical covariance matrix .",
    "@xmath26 can be the arithmetic average , the median , the steady state or the principal components .",
    "restricting @xmath23 to @xmath9 simplifies the input perturbation to : @xmath32      observability quantifies how well a change in a state is reflected by the output .",
    "the analytical observability gramian is given by the smallest semi - positive definite solution of the lyapunov equation : @xmath33 .",
    "given an asymptotically stable underlying system the observability gramian can also be defined using the state - to - output map : @xmath34 the empirical observability gramian is defined as described in @xcite and @xcite :     + for sets @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and output @xmath38 during the steady state @xmath26 , @xmath39 , the * empirical observability gramian * is given by : @xmath40 with @xmath41 being the systems output for the initial state configuration @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath39 can be the arithmetic average , the median , the steady state output or the principal components .",
    "restricting @xmath36 to @xmath9 simplifies equation  ( [ obs ] ) to : @xmath43 and the initial state perturbation to : @xmath44      the cross gramian @xcite makes a combined statement about the controllability and observability , given the system has the same number of inputs and outputs .",
    "if the system is also symmetric , meaning the system transfer function is symmetric , then the absolute value of this gramians eigenvalues equal the hankel singular values .",
    "it is originally computed as the smallest semi - positive definite solution of the sylvester equation : @xmath45 .",
    "the cross gramian can also be defined using the input - to - state and state - to - output maps , if the underlying system is asymptotically stable : @xmath46 the empirical cross gramian has been introduced in @xcite for siso systems and was extended to mimo systems in @xcite .",
    "+ for sets @xmath22 , @xmath35 , @xmath23 , @xmath36 , @xmath24 , @xmath37 , input @xmath27 during steady state @xmath26 with output @xmath39 , the * empirical cross gramian * is given by : @xmath47 with @xmath29 and @xmath41 being the states and output for the input @xmath30 and initial state @xmath48 respectively .",
    "@xmath26 and @xmath39 can be the arithmetic average , the median , the steady state or the principal components of the output .",
    "again , restricting @xmath23 and @xmath36 to @xmath9 simplifies equation  ( [ crs ] ) to : @xmath49 as well as input and initial state perturbation to : @xmath50      the sensitivity gramian allows controllability based parameter reduction and identification .",
    "it is based on @xcite and aimed for models that can be partitioned as follows : @xmath51 the parameters @xmath52 are handled here as additional inputs .",
    "all summands of the partitioned system are treated as independent subsystems and thus a controllability gramian for each subsystem can be computed .",
    "each parameters controllability is encoded in the sum of singular values of the associated sub - controllability gramian @xmath53 .",
    "the sensitivity gramian is now given by the diagonal matrix , with each diagonal element being the trace of a sub - controllability gramian : @xmath54 the controllability and thus identifiability of each parameter is then given by the corresponding diagonal entry of the sensitivity gramian @xmath55 .",
    "for partionable linear systems , the sum of all subsystems controllability gramians @xmath53 and the parameter free subsystems gramian @xmath56 equals the usual controllability gramian @xcite : @xmath57 the sensitivity gramian can be applied to non - partitionable models with reduced accuracy .",
    "the identifiability gramian enables observability based parameter identification and consequently parameter reduction .",
    "as described in @xcite , the dynamic systems states are augmented with as many states as parameters that are constant over time , and have the initial value of the ( prior ) parameter value .",
    "@xmath58 the observability gramian of this augmented system holds the observability information of states and parameters . to extract the parameter specific observability ,",
    "the schur - complement can be applied to the augmented observability gramian : @xmath59      based on the identifiability gramian procedure , the cross gramian can be employed for a concurrent state and parameter reduction ( see @xcite ) . not only augmenting the states with constant parameter states as before , but also adding as many inputs @xmath60 and outputs as parameters , acting via identity on the augmented states and augmented outputs @xmath61 to preserve symmetry .",
    "the cross gramian of this special augmented system , similar to the identifiability gramian , holds the cross gramian of the original system as well as a cross identifiability gramian @xmath62 which can be extracted with the schur - complement from the joint gramian : @xmath63",
    "the * emgr * software framework presented here provides a uniform interface to compute all six empirical gramians and is given by : @xmath64 with @xmath65 and @xmath66 being handles to the system and the output function ; both requiring the signature @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "@xmath69 is a vector defining the systems number of inputs , states and outputs .",
    "@xmath70 holds the parameters .",
    "@xmath71 is a three component vector containing start time , time step and stop time .",
    "@xmath72 is a character setting the gramian type ; for an overview on the applicability of gramian types see table  [ tab ] .    following arguments are optional .",
    "the ten component vector @xmath73 configures the available options , including averaging types , input and state scale subdivisions and perturbation rotations .",
    "@xmath74 provides the input to @xmath1 and @xmath2 , while @xmath75 and @xmath76 set steady input and steady state .",
    "@xmath77 and @xmath78 define the scales of the perturbation .",
    "lastly , @xmath79 allows to pass experimental data to be used instead of generated snapshots .",
    "the parameter reducing empirical gramians ( sensitivity , identifiability and joint ) are an encapsulation of the state reducing empirical gramians ( controllability , observability and cross ) .",
    "computation of the latter is extensively vectorized , exploiting the gramian matrix assembly format .",
    "in example , the empirical observability gramian assembly from equation  ( [ obs ] ) can be computationally simplified to : @xmath80 computation of empirical gramians using * emgr * is very portable , since only basic vector and matrix operations are required .",
    "necessary integrations , meaning simulations for given inputs or initial states , are accomplished either by the first order euler s method , second order adams - bashfort method or second order leapfrog method . the empirical gramian framework *",
    "emgr * as well as the following experiments are released under an open source license , are compatible with octave and matlab , and can be found at or at the .",
    ".empirical gramian application matrix .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "to demonstrate the various empirical gramians , computed by the * emgr * framework , a symmetric nonlinear mimo system with one hundred states , ten inputs and ten outputs is employed .",
    "the system matrix is generated randomly with ensured stability and symmetry ; the input matrix @xmath81 is also a random matrix and the output matrix is given by @xmath82 .",
    "furthermore a random , but element - wise , parametrized source term @xmath83 of dimension @xmath84 parameters is added .",
    "input is applied through a delta impulse . @xmath85",
    "first , a state reduction , using the empirical controllability gramian and the empirical observability gramian , through balanced truncation is performed in figure  [ wcwo ] , reducing the number of states to the number of outputs .",
    "balanced truncation as a classic approach in model order reduction will be used as a baseline , to which the following methods will be compared .",
    "next , a state reduction by direct truncation employing the empirical cross gramian is demonstrated in figure  [ wx ] ; again reducing the number of states to ten .",
    "the state reduction via direct truncation of the cross gramian has about the same error , but requires only half of the reduction time , since only one gramian and no balancing is required .",
    "the empirical sensitivity gramian can be applied if the underlying system can be partitioned such that @xmath86 . to be able to use it in this setting ,",
    "the parametrized source term is reduced to the number of outputs in figure  [ ws ] .",
    "the sensitivity gramian is the fastest parameter reduction method , but has a high relative error in outputs .",
    "since the parameters of the source term are reduced , the cumulative effects in the original system are the origin of the increasing error over time .",
    "next , the parametrized source term is reduced by the empirical identifiability gramian in figure  [ wi ] .        taking five times as long for the parameter reduction ,",
    "the identifiability gramian is about two orders of magnitude more accurate .",
    "finally , in figure  [ wj ] , the same system undergoes a combined state and parameter reduction using the empirical joint gramian .",
    "though with longest total duration , the joint gramian is the only gramian allowing direct , balancing - free combined reduction of state and parameter space with a comparable relative error .",
    "this combined reduction generates a reduced - order model , of which the relative error is comparable to the other reduced models .",
    "the * emgr * framework already allows a wide range of computations of empirical gramians for state or parameter reduction .",
    "apart from model order reduction , the empirical gramians can be employed for system identification tasks , like parameter identification or sensitivity analysis as well as decentralized control , nonlinearity measurement and uncertainty quantification .",
    "further work will enhance the flexibility , while keeping the interface as simple as possible .",
    "following @xcite , allowing factorial designs will greatly enlarge the field of application .",
    "finally , extending the use of the cross gramian ( and thus the joint gramian ) to non - symmetric systems @xcite will enable a combined state and parameter reduction for general linear and nonlinear models without balancing .",
