    "the question of possible fixed points and rg flows in @xmath3 theories with supergroup symmetries plays a major role in the supersymmetric approach to phase transitions in non - interacting disordered systems ( such as the transition between plateaux in the integer quantum hall or spin quantum hall effects ) .",
    "although some similarity with what happens in systems with ordinary group symmetries is expected , it has also become clear over the last few years that more complicated scenarios are at work . among the features that play a key role in these scenarios",
    "are the facts that supergroup symmetries are not protected by the mermin - wagner theorem and can be spontaneously broken in two dimensions ; that the lack of unitarity allows non kac - moody ( logarithmic ) conformal field theories with supergroup symmetry ; etc .",
    "recent references in this area are @xcite",
    ".    a systematic program to investigate these questions would be to tackle the continuum limit of spin chains with supergroup symmetries , either with compact or non - compact representations , with or without integrability .",
    "this turns out to be quite hard ( for some recent work in this direction , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , as profoundly new features appear , on top of , and maybe related to , technical difficulties , already in the first steps of this program .",
    "we discuss in this paper one of the simplest possible examples of a supergroup theory one may imagine , the supersphere sigma model @xmath4 .",
    "this model is deeply related to the arboreal gas model ( see fig .  [ figforest ] ) , and the @xmath5 limit of the potts model on the square lattice , and through these relations , can be studied in considerable detail . in particular , the relation with the potts model provides a phase diagram for the sigma model , a confirmation that the perturbative results are identical with those of the @xmath6 sigma model , and the identification of ` a ' critical point of the sigma model with the antiferromagnetic transition in the potts model , as well as the transition in the arboreal gas model .",
    "surprisingly , the associated critical theory turns out to be of a type seldom if ever encountered before in lattice models : with @xmath7 , it involves a non - compact boson as well as a symplectic fermion , and is related to a theory with a larger , @xmath8 , symmetry .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we review the relationship between the @xmath0 potts model , the arboreal gas model , and the sigma model .",
    "a short version of the results presented there has appeared in ref .",
    "related results have also appeared in ref .",
    "sections 3 and 4 discuss the continuum limit of the model at the antiferromagnetic critical point using bethe ansatz equations as well as techniques from conformal field theory . in section 5 we prove the remarkable identity between the bethe equations for the @xmath0 antiferro potts model and the integrable @xmath9 spin chain in the fundamental representation . using general results about the phase diagrams of orthosymplectic chains provides independent confirmation of our continuum limit identification .",
    "some conclusions are gathered in section 6 while the appendix discusses a few technical aspects of bethe ansatz for the @xmath10 algebra .",
    "this paper is not only a step up the program of understanding statistical mechanics models with supergroup symmetries : first , the results will prove extremely useful in the analysis of the antiferromagnetic potts model for @xmath11 generic , which we will discuss elsewhere @xcite ; second , the arboreal gas is a model of great interest from the point of view of transitions in gases of ` hard ' objects at negative fugacity ; finally , the relationship between the arboreal gas and the sigma model provides a way to investigate fundamental questions  like the role of global topological properties in sigma models in their broken symmetry phase  in a particularly simple context .",
    "the potts model at @xmath0 can only be well defined through the cluster expansion and a proper limiting procedure @xcite .",
    "this requires generally to approach coupling @xmath12 along lines @xmath13 , in which case the partition function as @xmath5 can be rewritten as the partition function of an arboreal gas @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the number of ways of covering the lattice with @xmath16 non - overlapping trees ( a forest ) , such that each site belong to one and only one tree .",
    "the proof of this statement is straightforward .",
    "write the partition function as @xmath17 where @xmath18 are subgraphs of the lattice made of @xmath19 bonds and @xmath20 clusters ( connected components ) , @xmath21 is the total number of sites , @xmath22 the number of cycles on the clusters .",
    "we have used euler s relation ( valid in the plane or on an annulus , a geometry we will consider below ) , @xmath23 . in the last equation @xmath24 , @xmath25 . as @xmath5 , only graphs without cycles survive , giving the result ( [ arboreal ] ) after a renormalization of @xmath26 .",
    "this is true irrespective of the lattice .    on the square lattice",
    ", the usual critical potts model corresponds to approaching @xmath0 along the selfdual curve @xmath27 @xcite , i.e. , by taking @xmath28 , in which case one keeps a single spanning tree .",
    "the geometrical properties are then described in terms of a symplectic fermion theory @xcite .",
    "similarly , on the triangular lattice the selfdual curve reads @xmath29 @xcite , which , for @xmath30 and @xmath31 , becomes @xmath32 , whence @xmath28 and the equivalence with a spanning tree follows once again .",
    "these two lattices thus strongly suggest that the usual critical behaviour is universal , and governed by symplectic fermions .",
    "the case @xmath33 corresponds to a massive region in the potts model phase diagram , and therefore the arboreal gas is massive .",
    "the case @xmath34 negative is more interesting .",
    "while the model is still massive for @xmath35 big enough , on the square lattice and for @xmath36 , the model is massless , and flows to the symplectic fermion theory again .",
    "the special value @xmath37 is critical , and corresponds to the limit @xmath5 of the critical antiferromagnetic potts model on the square lattice @xcite .    on the triangular lattice",
    "there is strong numerical evidence for a massless regime when @xmath38 , again characterized by a flow to the symplectic fermion theory @xcite .",
    "however , since @xmath39 is only known numerically , it appears to be difficult to detect whether there is distinct critical behaviour exactly at @xmath40 , and what is the exact nature of the transition to the massive regime @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "it turns out that , on any planar graph , the arboreal gas can be expressed in terms of an interacting symplectic fermion theory @xcite .",
    "this comes from the remarkable identity @xmath42 here , each lattice site @xmath43 carries a pair of fermions @xmath44 and @xmath45 , @xmath46 is shorthand for the measure of integration over every site , and @xmath47 is the discrete laplacian with matrix elements @xmath48 .",
    "thus , for @xmath49 , @xmath48 equals minus the number of edges connecting @xmath43 and @xmath50 , and @xmath51 equals the number of neighbours of site @xmath43 ( excluding @xmath43 itself , if the graph contains a loop ) .",
    "we have introduced the two objects @xmath52 where we recall @xmath21 is the total number of sites on the lattice , and the sum in @xmath53 is taken over pairs of neighbouring sites .",
    "this fermionic reformulation is interesting for several reasons , in particular because it allows one to derive quick conclusions on the phase diagram of the arboreal gas .",
    "one observes first that the action in eq .",
    "( [ identity ] ) exhibits a non - linearly realized @xmath54 symmetry .",
    "indeed , let us introduce on each vertex an auxiliary field @xmath55 subject to the constraint that @xmath56 .",
    "solving for @xmath57 gives two solutions , of which we chose @xmath58 , that is the ` body ' ( part made of c - numbers ) of @xmath57 positive ( which we denote by @xmath59 ) . using the basic rule that @xmath60 , together with @xmath61 , one can entirely eliminate the @xmath62 term in the action and write the functional integral as @xmath63\\nonumber\\\\       & & \\times \\exp\\left[\\sum_{i , j}\\eta_{1}(i)m_{ij}\\eta_{2}(j )        -a\\sum_{\\langle ij \\rangle}\\eta_{1}(i)\\eta_{2}(i)\\eta_{1}(j)\\eta_{2}(j)\\right]\\label{arbhemi }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",

    ", one finds that the action can be rewritten as @xmath66 the additional four - fermions term have disappeared from the action , which exhibits global @xmath54 symmetry ( the group of transformations leaving the scalar product invariant ) .",
    "the generating function in fact looks exactly like the one of a discretized sigma model on the target manifold @xmath67 !",

    "note that no lattice spacing ( say , @xmath80 ) appears in this action as the @xmath81 from the expansion of the fields is compensated by the @xmath82 from the transformation of the discrete sum over lattice sites into an integral .",
    "we now go back to the issue of the sign of the field @xmath57 .",
    "there are of course _ two _ solutions to the equation @xmath83 .",
    "while we have focused on @xmath84 , the other choice @xmath85 is also possible .",
    "it is therefore more correct to say we have mapped the @xmath5 potts model or the arboreal gas model onto a hemi - supersphere sigma model : the correspondence with the sigma model holds exactly at the perturbative level , but breaks non - perturbatively .",
    "this is not expected to affect the physics in the broken symmetry phase where the field is slowly varying , and does not jump between the two solutions .",
    "the physics in this phase follows from the rg equation at one loop : @xmath86 with @xmath87 for @xmath54 and @xmath88 positive ( i.e. , @xmath68 negative ) .",

    "the @xmath101 terms again give an arboreal gas , but now each tree gets a more complicated weight @xmath102 so now trees getting near or across domain walls have their weight modified .",
    "as the lattice coupling is modified , a first sight analysis would say that generically in such a model , one will observe two transitions : an ising transition where only the dynamics of the @xmath100 variables becomes critical , and an arboreal gas transition , where only the dynamics of the trees becomes critical .",
    "these transitions will occur for different values of @xmath68 .",
    "hence the critical point of the arboreal gas , i.e. , the hemi - sphere lattice sigma model , will coincide in general with the critical point of the coupled system [ ising model + arboreal gas ] , i.e. , the full lattice sigma model .",

    "so the ising transition must be significantly hampered by the trees .",

    "this whole analysis may have to be taken with a grain of salt however .",
    "in particular , the arboreal gas is a model whose weights are extremely non - local , and the modification brought by coupling to the ising variables might have strange consequences .",
    "also , it is after all not clear how much of the conventional wisdom derived from models with positive boltzmann weights will extend to models such as ours , where the physics is determined by balance of positive and negative contributions in addition to the usual energy / entropy balance . at this stage , numerical study seems the best way to clarify the situation .",
    "the special value @xmath104 identified above corresponds more precisely to the end point @xmath5 of the antiferromagnetic critical line , which was identified by baxter @xcite as @xmath107 ( here @xmath108 are the usual horizontal and vertical couplings ) .",

    "one can see here that parity effects will likely occur .",
    "if @xmath110 is even , since we must also have an even number of upturned spins to make up pairs of bethe roots in the `` folding '' of the equations , the result strictly speaking will only apply to @xmath143 even , including the ground state .",
    "numerical study shows that in fact it holds for @xmath143 odd as well .",
    "if @xmath110 is odd on the other hand , since we must also have an even number of upturned spins to make up pairs of bethe roots in the `` folding '' of the equations , the result strictly speaking will only apply to @xmath143 odd .",
    "numerically , we have observed indeed that for @xmath143 even , including the ground state @xmath145 , results for @xmath110 odd obey a different pattern .",
    "this will be discussed later , and we restrict for now to @xmath110 even .",
    "the electric charges in the @xmath145 sector of the equivalent xxx chain are , for the untwisted case , integer , and give rise to the following gaps @xmath146 . combining all the excitations",

    "this free boson of course contributes only @xmath152 to the total central charge , so to get @xmath150 we need to invoke the presence of another theory with @xmath152 .",
    "to proceed , we consider the dynamics of the hole excitations over the ground state where the two lines @xmath153 are filled .",
    "we introduce the functions ( notations are the same as in @xcite ) @xmath154\\ ] ] and the fourier transform @xmath155 such that @xmath156 .",

    "while the symplectic fermion part identified so far has @xmath198 ( @xmath199 ) , it is very tempting at this stage to propose that the missing part of the spectrum consists simply in a non - compact boson .",
    "we now give a more direct argument for this .",
    "the partition function of the @xmath0 potts model on an annulus with free boundary conditions can be obtained in two steps , both based on previous works .",
    "the first step consists is expressing it as an alternate sum over generating functions of levels for type ii representations of @xmath200 ( where @xmath201 , and we use the notation @xmath202 for the quantum deformation parameter to avoid confusion with @xmath203 ) @xcite in the associated six - vertex or xxz model ( not to be confused with the xxx model which appears through its bethe equations earlier in this paper as a subsector of the potts model .",
    "the latter has @xmath204 while the former has @xmath205 ) .",
    "the second step consists in identifying the generating function @xmath206 of levels for the type ii representations .",

    "the astute reader might wonder why this expression does not satisfy for instance @xmath213 which would naively result from the quantum group symmetry that mixes all spin @xmath89 and spin @xmath214 representations @xcite .",
    "the reason is that the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix all go to zero as @xmath5 , and this transfer matrix can not be rescaled in such a way that its elements remain all finite as @xmath5 . alternatively , in a hamiltonian formulation , the ground state energy of the relativistic hamiltonian goes to @xmath215 in the limit @xmath5 . in that limit , the @xmath206 s",
    "are obtained after an additional renormalization , and do not have to satisfy the quantum group induced coincidences any longer .",
    "a little algebra shows that the generating function of levels ( partition function in the conformal language ) of the xxz or six - vertex model on the annulus is @xmath216    in the usual case of the critical @xmath0 state potts model , the equivalent of @xmath206 would be @xmath217 ( in that case one checks that @xmath218 indeed )",

    "the object @xmath221 written as @xmath222 can thus be interpreted as arising from a theory made of symplectic fermions and a non - compact boson , with partition function @xmath223 .",
    "the presence of the non - compact boson can be ascertained through a modular transformation .",
    "writing @xmath224 , we see that modular transformations in the usual @xmath0 critical potts model do close , since @xmath225 in the antiferromagnetic case meanwhile we now generate a continuous spectrum , according to @xmath226 as for the arboreal gas or ( the properly defined limit of ) the potts model itself , the partition function is @xmath227 this can be written , using the jacobi identity , as @xmath228 the corresponding object in the usual critical potts model ( @xmath229 ) would vanish identically . as before",

    "we thus see that the study of the model with free boundary conditions greatly strengthens the claim that the continuum limit of the model is made up of a symplectic fermion theory and a non - compact boson .",

    "the action corresponding to this continuum limit reads ( boltzmann weight @xmath77 ) @xmath231\\label{decaction}\\ ] ] with the boson @xmath57 being non - compact .",
    "now recall that the scaling limit of the arboreal gas , or the @xmath0 potts model in the berker - kadanoff phase , was identified with the @xmath54 supersphere sigma model , whose action reads exactly like eq .",
    "( [ decaction ] ) with the additional constraint that @xmath83 . to all appearances",
    "therefore , the critical point of the arboreal gas simply corresponds to a free @xmath54 field theory , where the constraint has been forgotten , and the symmetry is realized linearly .",
    "this interpretation requires some further discussion .",
    "the sigma model in the massless berker - kadanoff ( spontaneously broken symmetry ) phase has action @xmath232\\ ] ] with @xmath88 a _ negative _ quantity .",
    "it thus looks as if the natural action for the theory without constraint should be eq .",
    "( [ decaction ] ) with a negative sign .",
    "while this has no importance for the fermions ( the sign for them can be switched by a trivial relabeling ) it is not so at all for the boson . while the model @xmath233 is well defined , the model with @xmath234 is naively rather ill defined !",
    "it is possible to argue however , that since the theory is not compactified , this sign does not really matter .",
    "start with the ` proper ' free uncompactified boson , with action ( we put numerical constants explicitly now ) @xmath235 and thus propagator @xmath236 .",
    "the fact that @xmath57 is not compactified allows all powers of @xmath57 as fields , and hence by summation , all complex exponentials .",
    "however , since only normalizable states appear in the partition function ( see @xcite for further discussion on this point ) , only imaginary exponentials will show up there .",
    "this is compatible with the result of the functional integration @xmath237 hence in a transfer matrix study of such a model , we would see essentially a continuous spectrum above the central charge @xmath152 .",
    "note how the presence of operators with arbitrarily negative dimension does not make the theory unstable , nor does it affect the ground state in the transfer matrix calculations .",
    "if we admit that the `` full operator content '' is built out of fields @xmath238 and derivatives , then a change of variables @xmath239 should leave it invariant .",
    "this means that full operator content can be built as well out of @xmath240 and derivatives , where now @xmath241 has a propagator with the wrong sign , @xmath242 .",
    "normalizable states now correspond to real exponentials , and their contribution to the partition function gives exactly the same result as eq .",
    "( [ noncompactz ] ) , which can therefore be considered as the partition function for the theory with action @xmath243 in other words , we define the functional integral in the case of eq .",
    "( [ noncompactzz ] ) by analytic continuation , and since the set of allowed fields is invariant under this continuation , the partition function is the same in both cases .",
    "the fact that the critical point of the supersphere sigma model appears to be the free theory is a bit surprising .",
    "one would have expected instead the @xmath54 symmetry to be restored in a non - trivial way , and the model maybe to coincide with the critical @xmath244 model of nienhuis @xcite , discussed more thoroughly as an @xmath54 model in ref .",
    "the latter model however has central charge @xmath245 , and definitely is very different from the one we obtain .",
    "this difference might be related to the difference between the hemi - supersphere and the full supersphere sigma model .",
    "it might also be that some of the simplifications in the definition of the solvable @xmath246 critical model in @xcite ( such as the definition of the boltzmann weight ) affect the physics in an unexpected way when @xmath196 is negative , with , as a result , less universality than expected .",
    "we now notice that the bethe equations bear a strange similarity with equations written for a chain with @xmath247 symmetry .",
    "in particular , if we took a chain with alternating @xmath248 representations ( @xmath110 of either type ) , the equations would read , in the appropriate grading @xcite , @xmath249 more generally , the bethe equations for alternating representations build with @xmath196-supersymmetric tensors and the conjugate would look like eq .",
    "( [ bae33chain ] ) , but with the factor @xmath129 replaced by @xmath250 on the left - hand side ( source terms ) .",
    "our equations seem to correspond to taking `` quarter spin '' representations ( in @xmath251 inspired conventions , where the fundamental has spin @xmath116 ) .",
    "this in fact has a meaning , thanks to the work @xcite where it was shown that the bethe equations for a chain built with the four - dimensional typical representation ( and @xmath252 sites ) read @xmath253 where @xmath190 is the fermionic dynkin number ( denoted by @xmath254 in @xcite ) .",
    "the fundamental of @xmath247 corresponds to @xmath255 , a degenerate case .",
    "the case @xmath256 meanwhile corresponds to the fundamental representation of @xmath9 .",
    "energy terms in this case can also be read from @xcite and exactly match the term in the @xmath0 potts model case ( after a rescaling of the bethe parameters in @xcite ) .",
    "we thus conclude that the bethe equations and energy for the @xmath0 antiferromagnetic potts spin chain are identical with those for the integrable spin chain with @xmath9 symmetry built on the four - dimensional fundamental representation @xmath257 $ ] .",
    "note that the length of the @xmath9 system in these equations , denoted @xmath252 in the bethe equations , coincides with @xmath110 , where the number of spin @xmath116 representations in the spin chain is @xmath115 .",
    "hence the size of the hilbert spaces on which the two systems are acting are identical , and equal to @xmath258 . since the bethe equations also coincide , this is a very strong indication that the spectra of the two systems are identical , even though one has to be careful with such statements , as bethe spectra are not always complete in the superalgebra case .",

    "]      now , as argued in @xcite , the integrable model based on the four - dimensional fundamental representation of @xmath9 sits inside the goldstone phase of this model , and goes to the supersphere sigma model @xmath260 in the scaling limit .",
    "the latter model can be described @xcite by the following action .",

    "the integrable chain corresponds to spontaneously broken symmetry , with the theory being free in the uv and massless in the ir , corresponding to a _ negative _ coupling constant @xmath88 .",
    "critical properties are described by the @xmath266 limit of eq .",
    "( [ sigmaact ] ) . a rescaling and",
    "relabeling brings eq .",
    "( [ sigmaact ] ) into the form @xmath267\\label{sigmaacti}\\ ] ] with now @xmath268 .",
    "as @xmath266 , we thus obtain a symplectic fermion and a non - compact boson , with the wrong sign of the metric .",
    "this is exactly the low - energy theory we had identified earlier for the @xmath0 antiferromagnetic potts model , thus confirming our picture .",
    "note that the presence of a continuous spectrum in this @xmath9 version of the problem has a physical origin in the fact that the symmetry is spontaneously broken , and thus correlation functions of order parameters have no algebraic decay ( though have logarithmic behaviour ) .",
    "this feature was verified numerically in @xcite where it was found that the scaling dimensions of @xmath16 leg polymer operators extracted through transfer matrix calculations vanish inside the entire goldstone phase indeed .    as a final note",
    "we remark that the bethe equations for the @xmath9 chain have been most often @xcite written in a different grading from the one we used .",
    "it is also interesting to compare the analysis of the low energy physics from the more standard point of view .",
    "the usual bethe equations are written as @xmath269 with the energy @xmath270 ( note the change of sign compared to the other bethe ansatz ) .",
    "the relevant solutions for the low energy physics are : @xmath122 two - strings centered on real @xmath94 s ( denoted then by @xmath271 ) , and real @xmath122 s ( which are not in complexes , denoted then by @xmath272 ) .",
    "the corresponding bethe equations are @xmath273 the ground state is filled with the complexes .",
    "going to the continuum limit and using fourier transform gives the following physical equations , if we call @xmath157 the density of complexes , @xmath274 the density of real particles @xmath275 these equations show that the chain has a relativistic limit ( a feature peculiar to the value @xmath256 of the fundamental representation @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the density equations coincide with those for the @xmath5 antiferromagnetic potts model discussed above : even though we have started from two different gradings , we end up with identical physical equations , a very strong indication that our approach is consistent @xcite ( note in particular that the quantum numbers of the excitations , being expressed naturally in terms of complexes and real holes , have different expressions in terms of the bare quantum numbers ) and the results correct .",
    "to finish the analysis of the @xmath9 system , the most useful quantity one can consider is the ` equivalent spin ' defined by forming the combination @xmath276 .",
    "the four states of the fundamental representation @xmath277 correspond respectively to the values @xmath278 . on the other hand , according to the detailed lattice model derivation of the bethe ansatz equations @xcite , @xmath279 the spectrum is expressed in terms of sums and differences of @xmath280 and @xmath281 , where the subscripts @xmath282 indicate complexes and real particles respectively .",
    "one has @xmath283 we thus see that it is possible to change the value of the pseudospin @xmath140 without changing @xmath284 , i.e. , by exciting only the flat part of the spectrum .",
    "in other words , in the geometrical interpretation , the gaps for @xmath16 leg operators are all expected to vanish .",
    "this result agrees with predictions based on the goldstone analysis of the @xmath8 loop model , as well as numerical calculations @xcite , and we take the consistency of the different approaches as a justification of our use of the dressed charge formalism in these problems .",
    "even though we have found that the bethe equations for the two models are identical , we do not exactly know how to map them onto each other .",
    "clearly , one must combine pairs of neighbouring spin @xmath116 representations of the vertex model to make up four - dimensional representations of the @xmath9 algebra , but we are not sure how to implement this .",
    "part of the difficulty comes from the highly singular nature of the potts transfer matrix as @xmath5 .",
    "it is interesting to notice however that as @xmath285 , the tensor product of two fundamental representations of @xmath200 , which decomposes as the sum of a one and a three dimensional representations like for @xmath204 when @xmath202 is generic , becomes indecomposable , and has the structure shown in fig .",
    "[ indecrep ] , where @xmath286 and @xmath287 , and the arrows indicate the action of the @xmath200 generators : @xmath288     for @xmath205 .",
    ", width=192 ]    it turns out that , if one introduces the other generators @xmath289 at @xmath205 , together with the limits @xmath290 , one obtains the four - dimensional representation of @xmath9 .",
    "this suggests a mechanism by which the symmetry of the lattice model must be enhanced at the critical point .",
    "one can in fact show by brute force that by concatenating pairs of spins @xmath116 into four degrees of freedom and carefully taking the @xmath5 limit of the boltzmann weights of the heterogeneous 6-vertex model equivalent to the critical antiferromagnetic @xmath11 state potts model , the @xmath291 matrix of the @xmath9 integrable vertex model in the fundamental ( @xmath257 $ ] ) representation is indeed obtained .",
    "this will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "note of course that the @xmath9 integrable model can be reformulated as a loop model .",
    "in fact the whole goldstone phase has been argued to be realized physically by taking a model made of a single dense loop where crossings are allowed . this can be obtained ( and studied numerically ) for instance by taking the usual @xcite covering of the surrounding lattice of the square lattice with a single self avoiding loop , and then allowing self - crossings .",
    "it is well known that in the case where self - crossings are not allowed , the loop the hull of a spanning tree , hence giving rise to the well - known close relationship between the critical theory of dense polymers and that of spanning trees , both being related to symplectic fermions @xcite .",
    "this relationship can to some extent be generalized to the arboreal gas and the loop with self - crossings ( see fig .  [ figloop ] ) . indeed , draw on the lattice @xmath292 a spanning forest .",
    "draw on the dual lattice @xmath293 ( which in particular contains a single site outside @xmath292 ) a spanning tree .",
    "the resulting contour on the surrounding lattice is a single loop with a number of self - intersections equal to the number of trees on @xmath292 plus one !",
    "so we have a sort of correspondence between a self - crossing loop and an arboreal gas , i.e. , between a system with @xmath9 symmetry and the @xmath5 antiferromagnetic potts model .",
    "however , this is not a very satisfactory correspondence . in particular , because the tree on the dual lattice plays a crucial role in determining the loop configuration , there is no one to one correspondence between loop and forest .",
    "also , giving a negative fugacity to trees corresponds to a negative weight for self - crossings of the loop , while the existence of the goldstone phase was argued in @xcite for positive weights only .",
    "the most interesting conclusion is probably the emergence of a non - compact boson in the continuum limit of the critical antiferromagnetic potts model at @xmath0 .",
    "although it is difficult to demonstrate the existence of such a non - compact object based on any single analysis , the convergence of bethe ansatz calculations , numerical calculations , and symmetry considerations , leaves very little doubt that the conclusion is correct .",
    "this is , to our knowledge ( together with our earlier work on goldstone phases @xcite , which as we saw is intimately related ) , the first time that a non - compact object appears in the continuum limit of a lattice model with a finite number of degrees of freedom ( but ` unphysical ' boltzmann weights ) . in a subsequent work , we will see that this feature extends to the antiferromagnetic potts model away from @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "we have also seen how this non - compact boson is part of a free @xmath54 theory , which appears here as a critical point of the super ( hemi-)sphere sigma model .",
    "the main question that remains unanswered in this study of the physics of models with supergroup symmetry is what happens to the ` other ' ( nienhuis ) critical @xmath244 model @xcite , and how this is related with a possible difference between the critical points in the hemi and full supersphere sigma models .",
    "we hope to get back to these questions soon .",
    "to finish , we can clarify several remaining points .",
    "the first is the issue of what happens when the size of the lattice system @xmath110 is odd . as will be discussed in details for the general antiferromagnetic potts model in @xcite , the spectrum in that case does not show any signs of non - compactness because the bosonic field @xmath57 appears to be twisted ( and thus its properties independent of any compactification radius ) .",
    "by @xmath54 symmetry , the fermionic field is also twisted , so the effective central charge in this sector is @xmath294 in agreement with numerical calculations @xcite .",
    "the second point is that numerical @xcite as well as analytical arguments @xcite suggest that the critical point is , in the potts model point of view , approached from the berker - kadanoff phase ( the broken symmetry phase ) with a singularity in the free energy of the form @xmath295 ( we recall that @xmath37 for the square lattice . ) using hyperscaling , this corresponds to a perturbation of the critical point by a field of _ vanishing dimension_. there are of course plenty of such fields in the non - compact boson theory .",
    "we speculate that the scaling limit near and below @xmath296 could be described by the simple landau - ginzburg theory @xmath297 +      ( a^{*}-a)\\left(\\phi^{2}+2\\eta_{1}\\eta_{2}-1\\right)\\ ] ] for which the logarithm in @xmath298 [ see eq .",
    "( [ freeenergy ] ) ] follows as well .    .scaling exponents @xmath299 describing the probability @xmath300 that @xmath301 distinct trees come close in points @xmath89 and @xmath302 .",
    "the data is obtained by fitting transfer matrix results in the random - cluster picture , on periodic square - lattice cylinders of widths @xmath252 and @xmath303 .",
    "note the strong finite - size dependence for tree fugacity @xmath304 . for @xmath305",
    "the exact result is @xmath306 @xcite . [",
    "cols=\"<,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the last point concerns the physical interpretation of our results .",
    "this of course has to be taken with a bit of care , as our model involves negative boltzmann weights .",
    "but the image we have is that in the region @xmath36 , the partition function is dominated by configurations where a single infinite tree covers a finite fraction of the lattice ",
    "this fraction is unity as @xmath28 , and remains finite in the whole phase @xmath307 , the rest of the lattice being covered by trees of finite size .",
    "tree exponents are the same as in the limit @xmath28 , as can be checked numerically in table  1 .",
    "in particular , the fact that the one - tree exponent remains equal to zero guarantees that there is an infinite tree , and that its fractal dimension is equal to two . at @xmath308",
    ", we have coexistence of two phases , one with an infinite tree of finite density , the other with only finite trees .",
    "as @xmath308 is crossed , the derivative of the free energy with respect to @xmath68 is discontinuous @xcite , implying that the average number of trees per lattice site , and thus the average size of finite trees , experiences a discontinuity . in the phase @xmath309 ( like in the phase @xmath33 )",
    ", there are only finite trees , of typical linear size given by the finite correlation length .",
    "the point @xmath308 is actually a first - order critical point , that is a point where a first and second order phase transition coincide @xcite . at such a point",
    ", some correlations still decay algebraically , while some of the thermodynamic properties have discontinuities .",
    "the latter translate into operators of vanishing dimensions , for which we expect an infinite multiplicity . the simplest formalism to encompass",
    "this multiplicity is a non - compact boson , in agreement with what was found previously .",
    "we conclude with a side remark . the fermionic representation of the arboreal gas model , instead of being used to argue for the presence of an @xmath54 symmetry , can be used to get yet another representation , this time in terms of a loop model .",
    "for this , go back to the initial path integral ( [ identity ] ) written in terms of fermions @xmath310 only @xmath311\\ ] ] simply expand the exponent , and contract the fermions .",
    "this is like the standard high temperature expansion for the nienhuis @xmath246 model .",
    "it gives rise to a sum over non - intersecting loops , with weight @xmath312 per loop ( like in the @xmath313 model ) , plus non - overlapping monomers with weight @xmath314 , and dimers ( which can be considered as degenerate length - two loops ) with weight @xmath315 .",
    "the critical point @xmath104 means monomers disappear , dimers have weight @xmath316 .",
    "we are not sure why this model should be critical  note the dimers seem to encourage swelling of the loops , instead of self attraction as one would expect to get to a tricritical point  and this direction certainly deserves further study .",
    "note that a critical point with @xmath7 has been identified in a modified version of the @xmath313 model in ref .",

    "it uses the fundamental representation of dimension 3 , and leads to the bethe ansatz equations ( for a review see @xcite ) @xmath317 algebraically , these equations correspond to treating the fundamental representation of @xmath247 as a non - typical fermionic representation with parameters @xmath318=[-1/2,1/2]$ ] , of dimension 3 instead of 4 . one",
