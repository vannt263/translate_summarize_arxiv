    "the rare kaon decays @xmath6  and @xmath1  offer unique opportunities to probe higher order phenomena associated with quark mixing and the origin of cp non - invariance .",
    "e787 at the brookhaven national laboratory alternating gradient synchrotron ( ags ) has measured the @xmath6  decay  @xcite based on the observation of two events with low expected background .",
    "this measurement was based on data from the pion momentum region above 205 mev / c ( the @xmath2  peak ) ; we have recently extended this measurement to the low momentum region with new techniques @xcite .",
    "the branching ratio indicated by these observations is consistent with the standard model ( sm ) expectation . to fully explore the possibility of new physics or to make a precise measurement of the t - d quark coupling @xmath7 ( assuming the sm level for @xmath8 ) ,",
    "a new measurement is about to commence .",
    "e949 is designed to obtain a single event sensitivity of ( 814)@xmath9 , roughly an order of magnitude below the sm prediction . in order to reach this sensitivity",
    "the present detector has been upgraded , and data running has begun with higher kaon flux . with the completion of e949 in 2004 ,",
    "the possibility of an inconsistency with the sm prediction of @xmath6   will be fully explored or the important top - down quark mixing parameter will be determined to a precision @xmath10 if the sm expectation is confirmed .",
    "in addition , it has become evident that the @xmath11 sector can yield the single most incisive measurement in the study of cp violation through a measurement of the branching ratio for @xmath1  ( @xmath12 ) , estimated to be about @xmath13 . within the sm",
    "this is a unique quantity which directly measures the area of the ckm unitarity triangles _",
    "i.e. _ the physical parameter that characterizes all cp violation phenomena , or the height of the triangle shown in fig .",
    "[ triangle ] .",
    "the quest to observe @xmath1  is being taken up by the new kopio experiment at bnl discussed below .",
    "@xmath14    the measurements of @xmath8  and @xmath12  will result in a complete picture of standard model cp - violation in the @xmath11 system and a comparison with comparably precise measurements anticipated from the @xmath15 sector will be possible .",
    "@xmath0 is a flavor - changing neutral current process , arising at the one loop level in the sm as shown in fig .",
    "[ feyndiag ] .",
    "@xmath17    the presence of the top quark in the loops makes this decay very sensitive to the modulus of the elusive ckm coupling @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "moreover , this sensitivity can be fully exploited because of the hard gim suppression , the relatively small qcd corrections ( which have been calculated to next - to - leading - logarithmic order  @xcite ) , and the fact that the normally problematic hadronic matrix element can be determined to a few percent from the rate of @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) decay  @xcite .",
    "taking account of all known contributions to the intrinsic theoretical uncertainty , the branching ratio can be calculated to a few percent  @xcite , given the sm input parameters .",
    "qcd corrections to the charm contribution are the leading source of the residual theoretical uncertainty .",
    "long distance contributions are known to be negligible so not only can the effects of sm short - distance physics be clearly discerned , but also the effects of possible non - sm physics . in the sm , using current data on @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 mixing , etc .",
    ", the branching ratio is expected to be @xmath8  @xmath27 .",
    "the @xmath1   decay mode is unique in that it is completely dominated by direct cp violation  @xcite due to the cp properties of @xmath28 , @xmath29 and the relevant short - distance hadronic transition current .",
    "since @xmath30 is predominantly a coherent , cp odd superposition of @xmath31 and @xmath32 , only the imaginary part of @xmath33 survives in the amplitude .",
    "the comments made above about the hadronic matrix element , qcd corrections , etc .",
    ", in @xmath6  also apply to @xmath1  with the additional feature that the lack of a significant charm quark contribution reduces the intrinsic theoretical uncertainty to @xmath34@xmath35 .",
    "since the value of the sine of the cabibbo angle is well known ( @xmath36 ) , @xmath37 is equivalent to the jarlskog invariant , @xmath38@xmath39 .",
    "@xmath38 , in turn , is equal to twice the area of any of the six possible unitarity triangles  @xcite . since theoretical uncertainties",
    "are extremely small , measurement of @xmath12  will provide the standard against which all other measures of cp violation will be compared , and even small deviations from the expectation derived from sm predictions or from other measurements , _",
    "e.g. _ in the @xmath15 sector , will unambiguously signal the presence of new physics . in the wolfenstein parameterization of the ckm matrix , @xmath40 inserting the current estimates for sm parameters into eq .  [ bklpnw ] , the branching ratio for @xmath1   is expected to be in the range @xmath41 . a clean measure of the height of the unitary triangle , @xmath42 , is provided by the @xmath1   branching ratio .",
    "we note that , all other parameters being known , eq .",
    "[ bklpnw ] implies that the relative error of @xmath42 is half that of @xmath12 .",
    "thus , for example , a @xmath43 measurement of @xmath12   can , in principle , determine @xmath42 to @xmath44 .    most forms of new physics  @xcite postulated to augment or supersede the sm have implications for b(@xmath45 ) .",
    "in minimal supersymmetry and in some multi - higgs doublet models  @xcite , the extraction of @xmath46 and @xmath47 from cp asymmetries in b decays would be unaffected .",
    "such effects might then show up in a comparison with @xmath1 , where , e.g. , charged higgs contributions modify the top quark dependent function in @xmath12 .",
    "in other new physics scenarios , such as supersymmetric flavor models  @xcite , the effects in @xmath45   tend to be small , while there can be large effects in the @xmath15 ( and also the @xmath48 ) system . in these models",
    "the rare @xmath11 decays are the only clean way to measure the true ckm parameters .",
    "loop diagrams involving new heavy particles in extensions of the sm can interfere with sm diagrams and alter the decay rate , and also the kinematic spectrum@xcite .",
    "exotic scenarios such @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a hypothetical stable weakly interacting particle or system of particles have also been suggested @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to obtain higher statistics for the @xmath6 decay and to extend the measurement to obtain the @xmath51 spectrum .",
    "the signature for @xmath0 in the e787 experiment ( see fig . [ det ] ) is a single @xmath52 stopping in a target ( tg ) , decaying to a single @xmath51 with no other accompanying photons or charged particles . in region 1 ,",
    "the major backgrounds were found to be the two body decays @xmath53  ( @xmath54 ) and @xmath55 , scattered beam pions , and @xmath52 charge exchange ( cex ) reactions resulting in decays @xmath56 , where @xmath57 or @xmath58 .",
    "region 2 has larger potential acceptance than region 1 because the phase space is more than twice as large and the loss of pions due to nuclear interactions in the detector is smaller at the lower pion energies . however , there are additional sources of background for region 2 .",
    "these include @xmath59 in which the @xmath51 loses energy by scattering in the material of the detector ( primarily in the tg ) , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) decays in which both the @xmath65 and the @xmath66 are invisible because of absorption .",
    "the data were obtained with a flux of @xmath67 electrostatically separated kaons per @xmath681.6 sec spill at 700 to 800 mev / c ( with @xmath6820% pion contamination)@xcite entering the apparatus . the beam momentum and spill",
    "was changed from time - to - time to get optimum efficiency .",
    "the kaons were identified by a cerenkov detector ; two multi - wire - proportional - chambers were used to determine that there was only one entering particle . after slowing in a beo degrader",
    "the kaons traversed a 10-cm - thick lead - glass ( pbg ) detector read out by 16 fine - mesh photomultiplier tubes ( pmt ) and a scintillating target hodoscope ( th ) placed before the tg .",
    "the pbg detector was designed to be insensitive to kaons and detect electromagnetic showers originating from kaon decays in the tg .",
    "the th was used to verify that there was only one kaon as well as determine the position , time , and energy loss of the kaon before it entered and stopped in the tg .",
    "the tg consisted of 413 5.0-mm - square , 3.1-m - long plastic scintillating fibers , each connected to a pmt .",
    "the fibers were packed axially to form a cylinder of @xmath6812 cm diameter .",
    "gaps in the outer edges of the tg were filled with smaller fibers which were connected to pmts in groups .",
    "the pmts were read out by adcs , tdcs , and 500 mhz transient digitizers based on gaas charge - coupled devices ( ccds)@xcite . photons were detected in a hermetic calorimeter mainly consisting of a 14-radiation length thick barrel detector made of lead / scintillator sandwich and 13.5-radiation length thick endcaps of undoped csi crystals @xcite .",
    "the rest of the detector consisted of a central drift chamber ( utc)@xcite , and a cylindrical range stack ( rs ) of 21 layers of plastic scintillator with two layers of embedded tracking chambers , all within a 1-t solenoidal magnetic field .",
    "the tg , utc , and rs allowed the measurement of the @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 of the charged decay products .",
    "the utc had 12 layers of anode wires for measuring the transverse momentum and six foils etched with helical cathode strips to measure dip angle or @xmath72 in the @xmath73 plane .",
    "after correction for energy loss in the target and i - counter , the momentum resolution was measured to be @xmath74% . after making corrections for the energy loss in the sub - detectors before entering the rs , the range and kinetic energy resolutions are measured to be @xmath75% and @xmath76% , respectively .",
    "the @xmath77 decay sequence from pions that came to rest in the rs was observed using another set of 500 mhz transient digitizers ( td)@xcite . the decay sequence observation is a powerful tool in identifying a charged pion .",
    "muon rejection from this information can reach about @xmath78 .",
    "this cut is independent of the @xmath79 separation using another cut on the range and momentum correlation for different particles , where the @xmath79 separation is more than 3@xmath80 .    the data reduction and offline analysis for region 1 and region 2 were similar @xcite , although the final cuts to enhance signal and suppress background to less than one event were different .",
    "the utc , rs with the td readout and the photon veto system were the most important elements for region 1 analysis .",
    "the tg with the ccd pulse digitizing system , and the photon veto system were the important elements for region 2 analysis . a multilevel trigger selected events by requiring an identified @xmath52 to stop in the tg , followed , after a delay of at least 1.5 ns , by a single charged particle track that traversed tg and rs with a hit - pattern consistent with the expectation for @xmath6 .",
    "events with photons were suppressed by vetos on the barrel and endcap detectors . in the  offline analysis , the single charged particle was required to be identified as a @xmath51 with @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 consistent for a @xmath51 , and the td pulse information consistent with the decay sequence @xmath81 in the last rs counter on the pion trajectory .",
    "the kinematic variables for region 1 were corrected for various correlations for each event and the signal region was defined by the intervals @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 . for region 2",

    "an experiment ( ckm ) to measure @xmath6 using a very high flux of kaons in flight has recently been approved at fermilab @xcite .",
    "the experiment relies on radio frequency separation techniques to obtain a clean 20 gev / c kaon beam with intensity of @xmath68 30 mhz .",
    "many of the photon veto and background reduction techniques will be similar to e787 , however , ckm will employ a ring imaging cerenkov detector to obtain additional measurement of the decay kinematics to reduce background .",
    "the experiment intends to obtain @xmath68 100 events with low background to make a precise measurement of this decay .",
    "an additional feature of ckm is that since it employs kaons decaying in flight , the main background in e787 for region 2 should not present as much difficulty .",
    "the detailed enumeration of backgrounds in region 2 in e787 analysis is therefore important for ckm .",
    "conclusive measurement of @xmath12  , which is estimated to be @xmath89 , requires a high kaon flux and very good background suppression .",
    "the backgrounds mainly come from competing decays that also yield @xmath29s with branching ratios that are millions of times larger , _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath90 .",
    "interactions between neutrons and kaons in the neutral beam with residual gas in the decay volume can also result in emission of single @xmath29s , as can the decays of hyperons which might occur in the decay region , _",

    "a 500 @xmath94 solid angle neutral beam is extracted at @xmath95 to produce a `` soft '' @xmath28   spectrum peaked at 0.65 gev / c ; kaons in the range from about 0.4 gev / c to 1.3 gev / c are used .",
    "the vertical acceptance of the beam ( 0.005 r ) is kept much smaller than the horizontal acceptance ( 0.100 r ) so that effective collimation can be obtained to severely limit beam halos and to obtain an additional constraint on the decay vertex position .",

    "are accepted .",
    "photons from @xmath1   decay are observed in a two - stage endcap detector comprised of a fine - grained preradiator followed by an 18 radiation length ( x@xmath97 ) electromagnetic calorimeter .",
