    "in mobile communication systems , the wireless channel induces random amplitude and phase variations in the received data , with the possible addition of time - varying interference from co - channel users . for this reason ,",
    "the accuracy of channel state information ( csi ) at the receiver is critical for coherent detection and demodulation .",
    "a number of methods have been proposed for estimation of csi , all of which fall within the broad categories of either pilot - assisted or blind algorithms . current and next - generation cellular protocols such as w - cdma ( wideband code division multiple access ) and 3gpp lte ( third generation partnership project long - term evolution ) specify the use of pilot - assisted channel estimation ( pace ) @xcite .",
    "pilot symbols or training sequences are known symbols either multiplexed with or superimposed onto the transmitted data in the time or frequency domain , with the associated disadvantage of a loss in spectral and/or power efficiency . moreover ,",
    "superimposed pace is degraded at low signal - to - noise ratios , and multiplexed pace is unsuitable for fast - fading channels with a coherence time shorter than the pilot - symbol transmission rate @xcite , @xcite .    _ blind channel - estimation methods _ offer an alternative approach that avoids the implementation cost of pilot symbols @xcite .",
    "blind methods typically use second - order statistics of the received symbols for csi estimation , with shortcomings such as increased complexity , slow convergence times , and channel - phase ambiguity @xcite .",
    "in addition , the received _ interference power spectral density _ ( psd ) , which is due to both the thermal noise and the time - varying interference , is usually not estimated in the literature spanning both pace and blind csi estimation . the accuracy of the interference - psd estimation is known to have a significant impact on turbo - principle ( iterative ) detection techniques as well as turbo and low - density parity - check ( ldpc ) channel decoding @xcite , mackay_noise .    the expectation - maximization ( em ) algorithm offers a low - complexity iterative approach to optimal maximum - likelihood detection and estimation @xcite , @xcite . a substantial body of literature can be found on em - based techniques for data detection , multiuser detection , channel estimation , or a combination of the latter .",
    "a few representative examples are listed next .",
    "a recursive estimation of the fading channel amplitude was proposed in @xcite .",
    "iterative receivers with em - based fading - amplitude and data estimation using pilot symbols for ldpc - based space - time coding and space - time block - coded orthogonal frequency - division multiplexing ( ofdm ) were studied in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",

    "iterative em estimation and turbo coding were studied assuming noncoherent frequency - shift keying modulation and demodulation , which is well - known to be less power - efficient than coherent modulation @xcite .    in @xcite , an em estimation approach for turbo - coded single - user iterative cdma receivers with binary phase - shift keying",
    "was considered . in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the authors replaced turbo codes with regular ldpc codes ; however , @xcite@xcite all featured as much as a 9.1% pilot - symbol overhead for channel - amplitude and interference - psd estimation .",
    "recently , em - based channel and noise estimation techniques were proposed in @xcite and @xcite for multiple - antenna systems with convolutional coding and as much as a 10% pilot - symbol overhead for initial channel estimation .",
    "although the primary role of pilot symbols in most cellular standards is channel estimation , pilot symbols often play a secondary role in cell , frame , or symbol synchronization .",
    "however , alternative methods of synchronization may be used when pilot symbols are unavailable @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in this paper , a doubly iterative direct - sequence cdma ( ds - cdma ) receiver featuring iterative em channel estimation and iterative detection and decoding without _ any _ pilot symbols",
    "is presented .",
    "the general form of the proposed blind channel estimator provides fading - amplitude , phase , and interference - psd estimates in both single - user and multiuser environments , therefore offering an alternative to the methods proposed in @xcite and @xcite to rectify the phase ambiguity of blind channel estimates . the special case of em channel estimation with perfect phase information at the receiver ( e.g. , by means of a phase - locked loop ) is also considered .",
    "the proposed iterative receiver is capable of using higher - order modulations such as m - psk and m - ary quadrature amplitude modulation ( m - qam ) , although quadriphase - shift keying ( qpsk ) is demonstrated in this work for simplicity .",

    "no channel interleaving is applied to the ira code due to the inherent interleaving characteristics of the ira code itself .",

    "the received signal is downconverted , passed through chip - matched filters , and despread by a synchronized spreading - sequence generator in each branch , with the downconverter and synchronization devices @xcite omitted in fig . 2 for clarity .",
    "self - interference between the spreading sequences of the desired user is negligible because accurate synchronization is assumed at the receiver .",
    "let @xmath49 denote the two - sided psd of the gaussian noise .",
    "for the flat - fading scenario , the complex envelope of the desired user at the @xmath50 symbol time with active mai can be written as @xmath51where @xmath31 is the complex transmitted code symbol of the desired user , @xmath52 is a complex zero - mean circularly symmetric gaussian noise sample with @xmath53 = n_{0}$ ] , and @xmath54 is the interference at the demodulator due to interfering users @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the time - varying mai is assumed to be generated by interfering users with a structure identical to the desired user , albeit the spreading sequences differ and the fading coefficients are independent .",
    "the despreading in the receiver tends to whiten the interference psd over the code - symbol passband , and the subsequent filtering tends to produce a residual interference with a gaussian distribution .",
