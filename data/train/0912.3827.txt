    "@xcite , instead of the plane @xmath21 the boundary of the plasma was taken as deformable due to the ponderomotive force .",

    "a peculiar property of eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) is the singular character of its third term when the envelope @xmath17 approaches zero at some point , except in the non - generic situation where the derivative is also zero at that point .",
    "the existence of a similar singularity was even an argument to discard a dissipative nonlinear quantum mechanics model introduced by kibble @xcite .",
    "actually , it is apparent from the original derivation @xcite that a formal expansion in powers of @xmath70 was used . clearly such a formal expansion is not valid near a singularity .",
    "therefore , the whole theory becomes invalid in such a case .    in this context",
    ", it is natural to assume an slowly varying and everywhere nonzero initial condition , @xmath71 .",
    "a obvious question is then : is the nonzero property of the envelope field preserved by eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) ?",
    "fortunately , the answer is yes , due to the following argument .    by inspection of eq .",
    "( [ e6 ] ) , a conservation law is easily detected , @xmath72 for _ e.g. _ decaying or periodic boundary conditions .",
    "therefore , we have a constraint preventing the singularity , provided the initial envelope is everywhere nonzero .    also due to the nonzero property of the envelope , it is convenient to linearize eq .",

    "( [ e1 ] ) has no rle when linearizing around a nonzero solution . in this context",
    "this term represents a higher - order nonlinearity .    from eq .",
    "( [ e19 ] ) , it follows that @xmath81 is imaginary and the wave amplitude remains bounded when @xmath82 , which is possible for @xmath83 since @xmath84 .    on the other hand , @xmath85 when @xmath86 and @xmath87 , so that the amplitude is exponentially amplified .",
    "this is a modified modulational instability admitted by eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) .",
    "as one of our final remarks , we observe that apparently there is no model for the parameter @xmath2 in the literature , in terms of physical quantities . at the present stage",
    ", it should be considered as a phenomenological constant , introduced as a result of a taylor expansion , see eq .",
    "( [ e4 ] ) . also the velocity @xmath32 can be arbitrarily chosen .",
    "other improvements could be the consideration of moving or diffuse @xcite boundaries .",
    "as discussed in section iv , the model eq .",
    "( 1 ) was derived on the assumption of a slowly varying nonzero envelope .",
    "it would be an relevant improvement , to derive the corresponding evolution equation allowing for zero amplitude solutions .",
