    "full - duplex ( fd ) communications is a promising technique which offers to double the spectral efficiency of radio links @xcite .",
    "this impressive capability can response part of the explosive demands for high data - rate services . due to this and despite multiple drawbacks of fd implementation , this technique has been considered as a candidate for next generation 5 g wireless networks @xcite .",
    "in addition , fd can eliminate hidden terminal problem in ad - hoc networks , congestion , and large end - to - end delays @xcite .",
    "therefore , fd communication systems have attracted many attentions in research area recently @xcite-@xcite .",
    "half - duplex ( hd ) and fd are two ways for connecting terminals in a wireless network .",
    "traditionally , hd terminals transmit or receive either at different times or over different frequency bands .",
    "therefore , for a simple connection , two time or frequency slots are consumed . on the other hand and",
    "when the terminals support fd connection , transmission and reception can be accomplished simultaneously in a same time slot and frequency band .",
    "therefore , resource consumption is reduced to the half of traditional hd links @xcite-@xcite .",
    "clearly , in a dense environment with a large number of users , employment of fd terminals can release a high amount of resources and may lead to the significant increase in data rate of active users .",
    "self - interference ( si ) from a transmitter to its own receiver is the evident result of using fd terminals . hence , management and reduction of si are vital for the practical implementation of fd systems @xcite-@xcite .",
    "fortunately , recent researches show efficient techniques for si reduction which were not possible until a few years ago @xcite .",
    "so , new research like our present paper can be considered for the practical purpose completely .",
    "another challenging technology for next generation 5 g wireless networks is relaying which can provide lower transmit powers , higher throughput , and extensive coverage @xcite .",
    "however , relaying suffers from low spectral efficiency .",
    "for example , consider one - way transmission from a source to a destination together with @xmath0 parallel relays",
    ". for complete transmission from the source and relays to the destination , @xmath1 different time slots or frequency bands are required .",
    "this may be compared with direct transmission between the source and destination which uses only one time slot and frequency band . here , fd devices ( fd relays and fd destination ) can be organized to reduce this weakness @xcite .",
    "therefore , fd relaying systems are of most interest among the other fd systems .",
    "to alleviate the complexity of fd relays , some quasi fd schemes like successive relaying , two - way relaying or buffer aided relaying are investigated @xcite , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "these techniques try to mimic fd relaying via two hd relays . in successive relaying",
    ", two relays listen to the source and retransmit their received signal to the destination successively . in other words",
    ", in each time slot , one of the relays receives a new data frame from the source while the other relay forwards the previous data frame to the destination .",
    "then , the role is swapped in the next time slot . in this way",
    ", a new data frame can be sent to the destination in each time slot as if fd relay was employed .",
    "in this situation , while transmission and reception of two relays occur in a same time slot and frequency band , the transmitted signal from one relay can disturb the received signal by the other relay simultaneously .",
    "therefore , inter - relay interference ( iri ) may degrade the whole performance .",
    "so , it has to be managed well in successive relaying @xcite-@xcite .",
    "due to high performance and simplicity of successive relaying , this paper concentrates on the power allocation of this scheme .",
    "power allocation is widely take into account in different relay structures such as amplify and forward ( af ) @xcite-@xcite or decode and forward ( df ) @xcite-@xcite relaying and under various conditions such as hd @xcite-@xcite or fd @xcite-@xcite transmission mode .",
    "in all these papers , the transmitted power at the source and/or relays is optimized to achieve certain target under power constraints .",
    "several optimization targets have been adopted , such as outage probability minimization , capacity maximization , and signal to noise ratio ( snr ) maximization .",
    "more precisely , successive relaying is also attracted attention and has been investigated from different aspects @xcite-@xcite .",
    "for example in @xcite-@xcite , the iri suppression are studied and different schemes based on differential cancellation and network coding are proposed for two - path successive relays . in @xcite-@xcite ,",
    "the authors have examined the throughput rate of a successive relay network which is suffered by the iri . then in @xcite , a spectrum sharing scheme for overlaid wireless networks based on the df successive relaying technique is proposed .",
    "however , power allocation and effective capacity in successive relaying in addition to iri considerations is not investigated previously . here , we study the power allocation of af successive relays for effective capacity maximization .",
    "the effective capacity is more general than the ergodic capacity which is defined as a maximum constant arrival rate with the delay quality - of - service ( qos ) guarantee @xcite-@xcite .",
    "then , the allocated power is derived under short - term and long - term iri constraints and compared with different allocation techniques with different qos requirements .",
    "iri is not always harmful , and , strong iri is more desirable in some states @xcite-@xcite .",
    "therefore , in the following , we assume both weak and strong iri in our optimization problem separately .    this paper is organized as follows : first , the system model is introduced in section [ sec:2 ] , where , successive relaying and interference management in this scheme are discussed .",
    "in addition , channel model and the effective capacity are explained here . in section [ sec:3 ]",
    ", we plan our optimization problem to maximize the effective capacity under different power constraints and then , the optimal allocated power is obtained in this section .",
    "finally , the simulation results are presented in section [ sec:4 ] , and section [ sec:5 ] concludes the paper .",
    "successive relaying behavior is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : successive_relaying ] , where two af relay nodes @xmath2 and @xmath3 , cooperate the source node @xmath4 , amplify its received signal and retransmit it to the destination @xmath5 successively .",
    "the direct source to destination link is also ignored . for more details , we assume each data frame has @xmath6 symbols @xmath7 , which has to be transmitted from the source to the destination .",
    "the specific steps for each time slot are described as follows @xcite :    * in the @xmath8 time slot , @xmath4 transmits @xmath9 , @xmath2 listens to @xmath9 from @xmath4 and @xmath3 is silent ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : successive_relaying](a ) ) . * in the @xmath10 time slot , @xmath4 transmits @xmath11 , @xmath3 listens to @xmath11 from @xmath4 while being interfered by @xmath9 from @xmath2 and @xmath2 amplifies and forwards @xmath9 to @xmath5 ( see fig . [",

    "[ fig : successive_relaying](c ) ) . * in the @xmath14 time slot ( @xmath15 is even ) , @xmath4 transmits @xmath16 , @xmath3 listens to @xmath16 from @xmath4 while being interfered by @xmath17 from @xmath2 and @xmath2 amplifies and forwards @xmath17 to @xmath5 ( see fig . [",

    "* in the @xmath18 time slot ( @xmath19 is odd ) , @xmath4 transmits @xmath20 , @xmath2 listens to @xmath20 from @xmath4 while being interfered by @xmath16 from @xmath3 and @xmath3 amplifies and forwards @xmath16 to @xmath5 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : successive_relaying](e ) ) . * finally , in the @xmath21 time slot ( @xmath22 is odd ) , @xmath3 amplifies and forwards @xmath23 to @xmath5 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : successive_relaying](f ) ) .",
    "now , we can observe that @xmath6 symbols are transmitted from the source and received completely in @xmath22 time slots by the destination .",
    "so , the multiplexing ratio becomes @xmath24 which approaches @xmath25 for a large number of symbols @xmath6 .",
    "this leads to the high spectral efficiency as can be obtained in fd relaying systems .",
    "except for the first and last time slots , relays provide interference for each other .",
    "note that , for achieving high performance of relaying systems , this iri has to be managed carefully .          for proper relaying system performance , management of iri between two relays",
    "is essential .",
    "hence , applying interference cancellation techniques such as interference alignment ( ia ) @xcite-@xcite or successive interference cancellation ( sic ) @xcite is strongly recommended .",
    "however for the sake of simplicity , we assume that the relays using sic for iri suppression and we explain the interference cancellation as follows : ( a ) when the iri is weak , the relay does not attempt to remove the interference .",
    "so , the power of interference is added to the power of noise and the overall snr is reduced slightly .",
    "( b ) on the other hand , when the iri is strong , the relay first detects the interferer signal .",
    "then , subtracts the estimated interference from the received signal .",
    "now , detection of the main signal without interference is possible . in this case",
    ", there will be no snr reduction due to interference .",
    "hence , the strong iri is not damaging in this case .",
    "most of the time , interference is detrimental and interferer signal and symbols are discarded .",
    "however , this subject is not always the best solution . in our successive relaying scenario ,",
    "the interference signal can be detected and used for further improvements .",
    "for example , according to description of [ subsec:21 ] , @xmath2 can extract just @xmath26 and @xmath3 can extract just @xmath27 when they transmitted from the source .",
    "hence , these two relays do not have an access to all symbols completely .",
    "but , by utilization of the iri , @xmath2 and @xmath3 can obtain @xmath27 and @xmath26 respectively .",
    "well , using the complete set of symbols in the relays , may lead to higher performance .",
    "therefore , the strong iri can be helpful in this scheme .",
    "for this reason , the strong iri will be considered as one of the constraints in the optimization problem of section [ sec:3 ] .      here , we assume uncorrelated quasi - static flat fading channel , where , @xmath28 and @xmath29 denote @xmath30 and @xmath31 channel coefficients and @xmath32 and @xmath33 show @xmath34 and @xmath35 channel coefficients and @xmath36 determines @xmath37 channel coefficient respectively .",
    "the distances of @xmath30 and @xmath31 as well as @xmath34 and @xmath35 are nearly the same .",
    "also , the average transmitted power by the source and each relay are assumed @xmath38 and @xmath39 and the power of additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) is the same at the relays and destination .",
    "therefore , the average snr at the @xmath30 or @xmath31 link is @xmath40 and at the @xmath34 or @xmath35 link is expressed as @xmath41 and at the @xmath37 link is written as @xmath42 .",
    "now , assuming iri cancellation with the sic technique , the overall instantaneous snr at the destination is written as @xcite @xmath43 where at the even time slots , @xmath44 and @xmath45 and at the odd time slots @xmath46 and @xmath47 respectively . in this way",
    ", the snr at the link between the relays can be expressed as @xmath48 . in the rayleigh fading channels , where @xmath49 , the probability density function ( pdf ) and the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of the snr are expressed as @xcite @xmath50\\ ] ] @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the first and zero - order modified bessel function of the first kind respectively ( * ? ? ? * eq .",
    "8.407 ) .",
    "the effective capacity is a similar concept to the capacity which investigates the effect of transmitter and receiver buffer ( queue ) delay on the capacity @xcite-@xcite . in this regard ,",
    "the effective capacity is defined as the maximum arrival rate that a wireless channel can support , in order to guarantee the qos requirements such as the statistical delay constraint @xcite-@xcite .",
    "consequently , the effective capacity is more realistic and can analyse the performance of the wireless channels against delay sensitive traffics more precisely .    for a dynamic queuing system with stationary and ergodic arrival and service processes , under sufficient conditions , the queue length process @xmath54 converges in distribution to a random variable @xmath55 such that @xcite @xmath56 for a large @xmath57 , where @xmath58 represents the non - empty buffer probability , @xmath57 determines a certain threshold and",
    "@xmath59 indicates the amount of required qos .",
    "in addition , for the delay of a packet in the buffer as the main qos metric , we have a similar probability function as @xcite @xmath60 where @xmath61 indicates the tolerated delay , @xmath62 is a delay - bound , and @xmath63 is jointly determined by both arrival and service processes . the statistical delay constraint in",
    "represents the qos which has to be guaranteed for the delay sensitive traffic sources .",
    "it is apparent that the qos exponent @xmath59 has an important role here .",
    "larger @xmath59 corresponds to more strict qos constraint , while smaller @xmath59 implies looser qos requirements .",
    "effective capacity provides the maximum constant arrival rate that can be supported by the time - varying wireless channel under the statistical delay constraint .",
    "since the average arrival rate is equal to the average departure rate when the buffer is in a steady - state @xcite , the effective capacity can be viewed as the maximum throughput in the presence of such a constraint . with all these explanations ,",
    "the effective capacity is defined as @xcite-@xcite @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the time - varying rate of the channel and @xmath66 denotes the statistical expectation . for a specific application with a given statistical delay requirement",
    ", the qos exponent @xmath59 can be determined from .",
    "then , the maximum constant arrival rate of the sources that a wireless channel can support in order to guarantee the given qos is concluded from .",
    "the power allocation scheme and the effective capacity of af successive relaying are discussed in the next section .",
    "in order to maximize the effective capacity , the allocation power scheme at the relay is extracted here . as we explained before ,",
    "high performance of successive relaying is obtained when the iri is considered and managed well .",
    "so , we will assume weak or strong and short - term or long - term iri constraints in our optimization problem .",
    "note that , weak constraint means the iri is lower than the specific threshold @xmath67 and subsequently , strong constraint means the iri is higher than the specific threshold @xmath67 .",
    "besides , short - term constraint means the instantaneous iri and long - term constraint means the average iri respectively .    with power allocation strategy , we assume that the relays can adapt their transmitted power to maximize the effective capacity . in this regard ,",
    "the relays transmit @xmath68 instead of @xmath39 , where @xmath69 depicts the time - varying allocated power coefficient and we have @xmath70 for constant average transmitted power .",
    "now , with this policy , the instantaneous snr at the destination is changed to @xmath71 and the instantaneous capacity is written as @xmath72 where @xmath73 specify the total required bandwidth and @xmath74 denotes one symbol duration or one transmission time slot in fig .",
    "[ fig : successive_relaying ] .",

    ", the iri has a significant influence in the performance of successive relays and this interference has to be managed properly . when the weak iri is desirable , we can adjust the transmitted power of the relays to obtain the short - term or long - term interference below some specific threshold @xmath67 .",

    "when we need the strong iri , we can adapt the transmitted power from the relays to obtain the short - term or long - term interference above the threshold @xmath67 .",

    "<S> in the relay based telecommunications with @xmath0 relays between the source and destination , @xmath1 time or frequency slots are required for a single frame transmission . however , without the relays , only one time or frequency slot is used for a single frame transmission . therefore , despite the benefits of relaying systems , this type of communications is not efficient from the spectral efficiency viewpoint . </S>",
    "<S> one solution to reduce this issue might be the full - duplex ( fd ) relays . </S>",
    "<S> an old technique which is reconsidered recently to improve the spectral efficiency of telecommunication systems . </S>",
    "<S> however , fd relays have a certain complexity , so , some similar techniques such as successive relays with nearly the same performance but less complexity is taken into account now . </S>",
    "<S> in successive relaying systems , two relays between the source and destination are employed which receive the transmitted frames from the source and relay it to the destination successively . </S>",
