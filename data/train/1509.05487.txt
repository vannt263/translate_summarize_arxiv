    "it is well - known that mesons play an important role in nuclear physics .",
    "the interaction of mesons with nuclei has two complementary components : meson - induced nuclear reactions and meson - nucleus bound systems .",
    "thus , an understanding of the ensemble of meson - nucleus interactions can enhance our knowledge of nuclear force and nuclear structure .",
    "the modern era of meson - nucleus physics began with the advent of various meson factories in the 1960s , where high - intensity pion ( @xmath3 ) and kaon ( @xmath4 ) beams were made available .",
    "since then , meson - nucleus bound systems such as @xmath3mesic and @xmath4mesic atoms have been studied extensively .",
    "consequently , a wealth of information has been obtained about @xmath3nucleus and @xmath4nucleus interactions .    for a long time , the role of eta ( @xmath0 ) meson in nuclear physics research was considered secondary because the @xmath0nucleon  nucleon ( @xmath5 ) coupling constant is much smaller than the @xmath6 and @xmath7 coupling constants . in the mid-1980s ,",
    "experiments at lampf showed that @xmath0 mesons are copiously produced in pion - induced nuclear reactions .",
    "this led to the development of the @xmath8 interaction model by bhalerao and liu ( bl )  @xcite .",
    "the model has made evident that @xmath0 production off a nucleon is dominated by the @xmath9 resonance and that both the @xmath10 and @xmath11 coupling constants are by no means small .",
    "the bl model was later used by haider and liu to predict the existence of nuclear bound states of the @xmath0 meson  the @xmath0mesic nuclei  @xcite .",
    "mesic nuclei differ from mesic atoms in two imporant aspects .",
    "while the formation of mesic atoms is driven by the coulomb interaction between a nucleus and the bound meson , the binding of an @xmath0 meson into a nuclear orbit is solely due to strong interaction because the @xmath0 carries no electric charge .",
    "furthermore , while the size of mesic atoms are of atomic scale , the size of @xmath0nucleus bound systems are of nuclear scale .",
    "the prediction of @xmath0mesic nucleus , a novel form of nuclear species adds , therefore , a new dimension to the study of the dynamics of @xmath0nucleus interaction and the properties of @xmath0 meson in nuclear medium  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we review the progress made in the search of @xmath0mesic nuclei since its prediction in 1986 . among others , we examine the various experimental approaches used in the search .",
    "we also analyze in depth different methods employed in interpreting the data . in section [ sec:2 ] ,",
    "we give a comprehensive analysis of the low - energy @xmath12 interaction models that are the basis of the formation of @xmath0mesic nucleus . in section [ sec:3 ] ,",
    "theoretical calculations that led to the prediction of the existence of @xmath0mesic nuclei are reviewed .",
    "in particular , we demonstrate the importance of treating realistically the subthreshold @xmath12 interaction in a nucleus .",
    "current status on experimental searches for @xmath0mesic nuclei , including the observation of @xmath0mesic nucleus @xmath1mg@xmath2 , are discussed in section [ sec:4 ] .",
    "suggestions on future search for @xmath0mesic nuclei are given in section [ sec:5 ] .",
    "the threshold of @xmath0nucleon system is 1488 mev which is 47 mev below the @xmath13 baryon resonance @xmath14 .",
    "this resonance couples strongly to the @xmath12 system with an @xmath15 decay branching fraction of about 4560% .",
    "consequently , in the threshold region the @xmath12 interaction is dominated by @xmath14 and it is attractive .",
    "bhalerao and liu  @xcite formulated an off - shell isobar model for threshold pionic @xmath0 production on a nucleon and @xmath12 scattering .",
    "they treated the three dominant reaction channels ",
    "@xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath12  in a coupled - channels formalism and unitarized the model through the generation of the coupled @xmath18matrices .",
    "the parameters of the model were determined from fitting only the @xmath16 phase shifts and inelasticity parameters in the @xmath19 , and @xmath13 channels over a broad range of energies . with these determined parameters ,",
    "the model was used to predict the @xmath20 cross sections and the @xmath12 scattering length , @xmath21 .",
    "the predicted scattering length has a positive real part.@xmath22    because the @xmath12 interaction is attractive , the inequality @xmath23>0 $ ] indicates that there is no @xmath24wave @xmath0nucleon bound state  @xcite .",
    "however , it can have an interesting nuclear implication . as will be shown in the next section , a first - order @xmath0nucleus optical potential , @xmath25 ,",
    "is proportional to @xmath26 with @xmath27 being the @xmath28matrix of the @xmath12 scattering and @xmath29 the nuclear form factor .",
    "consequently , @xmath23>0 $ ] leads to @xmath30 < 0 $ ] and , thus , to @xmath31 < 0 $ ] , _ i.e. _ , to an @xmath0nucleus interaction .",
    "the attraction , if strong enough , opens the possibility of having an @xmath0 bound in a nucleus to form a short - lived @xmath0nucleus bound state .",
    "indeed , the first prediction of the existence of such nuclear bound states , the @xmath0mesic nuclei , was made by haider and liu  @xcite .",

    "an inspection of table [ table:1 ] shows that the values of @xmath61 $ ] are confined into a narrower range than that of @xmath23 $ ] which varies between 0.20 and 1.14 fm .",
    "the strong model dependence of @xmath23 $ ] is due to the fact that @xmath23 $ ] is not directly constrained by the data .",
    "this dependence is further evidenced by the noted large differences between the various calculated scattering lengths given in some same publications . for example , @xmath23 $ ] varies from 0.87 to 1.05 fm in ref.@xcite . to emphasize the strong model dependence , birbrair and gridnev  @xcite calculated @xmath62 using two reaction mechanisms .",
    "they showed that one of the mechanisms , the @xmath14 resonance mechanism , gave @xmath23=0.56 $ ] fm .",
    "the other mechanism , the @xmath63meson - exchange mechanism , gave @xmath23=-0.15 $ ] fm ( even the sign changed ) .",
    "the combined effect of the two mechanisms on the real part of the scattering length was , however , not given .",
    "we note that the @xmath63meson - exchange has also been included in some meson - exchange models ( mem )  @xcite , although the individual contribution of the exchange diagram was not mentioned . in view of the result of mem",
    ", we believe that an overall negative @xmath23 $ ] is unlikely .    the second column of table [ table:1 ] indicates the model or method used in determining the scattering length .",
    "the possibility of making an off - shell extension of the model / method is given in the third column of the table .",
    "an off - shell extension ( ose ) of the @xmath12 model is particularly important for the investigation of @xmath0nucleus interaction .",
    "this is because for the formation of an @xmath0nuclear bound state , the basic @xmath12 interaction is off - shell .",
    "the models having both the off - shell momentum and off - shell energy dependences are indicated with a double plus sign ( + + ) in the ose column .",
    "many models do not have off - shell momentum form factors .",
    "however , as the lack of an explicit off - shell momentum form factor is equivalent to an off - shell momentum form factor having an infinite range in the momentum space , these models are labeled with a single plus sign ( + ) so long as they can be used to calculate @xmath12 interaction at subthreshold energies . otherwise , the models are labeled with a minus sign (  ) , as is the case with the final - state - interaction model  @xcite .    as can be seen from table [ table:1 ] ,",
    "many models are based on the @xmath4matrix approach  @xcite .",
    "a discussion on this approach is , therefore , in order . within the context of the @xmath4matrix approach ,",
    "one often begins by parametrizing the @xmath4 matrix and then relates it to the @xmath18 matrix by heitler s damping equation @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the free hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "one then uses the @xmath18 matrix to fit the data , whence to determine the parameters of the model .",
    "however , the data fitting can determine only the on - shell @xmath18 matrix and hence , by way of heitler equation , only the on - shell @xmath4 matrix .",
    "in other words , @xmath12 models formulated within the framework of @xmath4matrix approach do not provide an explicit way of making off - momentum - shell extension .",
    "the heitler on - shell relation has also led to the caution on the uniqueness of the off - shell @xmath18 matrix obtained by first extrapolating the on - shell @xmath4 matrix ( determined from fitting data ) to off - shell ( subthreshold ) energy region and then to infer the subthreshold @xmath18 matrix from the extrapolated @xmath4 matrix  @xcite .    besides @xmath4matrix and @xmath18matrix methods , many authors applied chiral pertubation theory ( chpt ) to calculate the @xmath8 scattering length  @xcite .",
    "the results are also given in table [ table:1 ] .",
    "the corresponding @xmath23 $ ] vary between @xmath66 to @xmath67 fm , depending on how the leading orders in the chiral expansion were calculated .",
    "however , as pointed out by kaiser _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , in order to investigate the formation of resonances one needs a non - perturbative approach which sums a set of diagrams to all orders .",
    "this summation is beyond the framework of systematic expansion scheme of chpt . to overcome this difficulty , a combination of chpt and pseudopotential methods was employed in refs.@xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the model of ref.@xcite is an improvement of that in ref.@xcite and it contains more terms .",
    "this improved model leads to a smaller @xmath12 scattering length : @xmath68fm .",
    "the authors of ref.@xcite believe that the smaller scattering length is a result of cancellations among the various reaction diagrams in the model .",
    "it is further noteworthy that in a recent coupled - channel isobars approach , durand _ et al . _",
    "@xcite included five meson - baryon channels and nine isobar resonances . by fitting directly the @xmath69 data , their model gave an @xmath70 fm , which is remarkably close to that given by the bl  @xcite model.@xmath71    in summary",
    ", there are compensations among contributions from various reaction mechanisms considered in the @xmath12 models .",
    "these mutual cancellations could be the reason that the two most recent models  @xcite , which contains many reaction diagrams , give rise to a small @xmath21 . in this respect ,",
    "we surmise that the bl model has grasped the essence of the @xmath12 dynamics .",
    "clearly , the quality of the @xmath12 models will be ultimately determined by their predictive power of the binding energies and widths of @xmath0mesic nuclei .",
    "the wave function of an @xmath0nucleus bound state ( or an @xmath0mesic nuclear state ) @xmath72 satisfies the eigenvalue equation @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the hamiltonian and @xmath75 is the eigenenergy .",
    "( for simplicity of notation , the quantum label @xmath76 will be omitted , but understood ) .",
    "solving the above equation is equivalent to solving the integral equation @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the free green s function .",
    "we will discuss and analyze the physics contents of three different approaches used to solve the eigenvalue equation in order to calculate the eigenenergy @xmath79  @xcite .      solving a four - dimensional eigenvalue equation requires a full relativistic description of the nucleus , which is still not available at this time .",
    "consequently , we make a covariant reduction  @xcite to obtain a covariant three - dimensional equation  @xcite :    @xmath80    here , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 are , respectively , the initial , final relative momentum , and the reduced mass of the @xmath0nucleus system .",

    "the existence of @xmath0mesic nucleus is a consequence of the attractive interaction between @xmath0 meson and nucleon in the threshold energy region of the @xmath12 channel .",
    "this attactive force arises from the strong coupling of the @xmath13 baryon resonance @xmath14 to the @xmath12 system .",
    "while the strength of the attraction is not enough to cause an @xmath0 to be bound on a single nucleon , it can cause the @xmath0 to be bound on a nucleus , forming a mesic nucleus with a finite half - life .",

    "we have shown in section  [ sec:3 ] that at the formation of an @xmath0-mesic nucleus the @xmath0 meson interacts with the target nucleon at an energy that is below the @xmath12 threshold .",

    "independent of whether an @xmath0 can be bound onto a light nucleus , studying @xmath0 production off a light nuclear system is important .",
    "firstly , because in the production of a physical @xmath0 , the basic @xmath12 interaction takes place at energies above the @xmath12 threshold , analysis of @xmath0 production can , therefore , test an @xmath12 model in an energy domain very different from that relevant to the @xmath0mesic nucleus formation .",
    "in addition , the presence of only a few target nucleons in a light nuclear system makes calculations of multistep processes involving each individual nucleon feasible .",

    "the production data in ref.@xcite are well described by the bhalerao - liu model of @xmath12 interaction .",

    "this is because the inner region of a medium- or heavy - mass nucleus are more close to a dense nuclear medium than the few - nucleon systems are .",
    "we mention , for example , the suggestion that @xmath0 bound states in nuclei are sensitive to the singlet component in @xmath0 and can be used as a probe of flavor - singlet dynamics  @xcite .",
    "hence , @xmath0mesic nuclei can improve our understanding on the @xmath0@xmath453 mixing .",

    "we believe that the successful observation of @xmath1mg@xmath342 , the encouraging structure in the excitation function of pion dcx reaction , the progress made in fsi studies , and the mastering of triple - coincidence and @xmath456 detection techniques have laid down a solid foundation for future successful searches of @xmath0mesic nuclei .",
