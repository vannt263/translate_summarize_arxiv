    "one of the major aims of research in nuclear physics is to make reliable predictions with one nuclear model in order to describe the ground - state properties of all nuclei in the nucleic chart .",
    "several approaches have been developed to study ground - state and single - particle ( s.p ) excited states properties of even - even and odd nuclei .",
    "due to the lack of fully understanding the strong interaction and to the numerical difficulties in handling the nuclear many - body problem , non - relativistic @xcite and relativistic @xcite mean field theories have received much attention for describing the ground - state properties of nuclei .",
    "one of the most important phenomenological approaches widely used in nuclear structure calculations is the hartree - fock - bogoliubov method @xcite , which unifies the self - consistent description of nuclear orbitals , as given by hartree - fock ( hf ) approach , and the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) pairing theory @xcite into a single variational theory .    molybdenum ( mo , z=42 ) and ruthenium(ru , z=44 ) , as well as all nuclei which have neutron numbers close to the magic number n=50 , exhibit many interesting nuclear properties such as anomalous behavior in the isotope shifts and large changes of shape @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we are interested in calculating and analyzing some ground - state properties of even - even and odd @xmath0 isotopes for a wide range of neutron numbers , by using skyrme - hartree - fock - bogoliubov method and a new generalized formula for the pairing strength .",
    "the ground - state properties we have focused on are binding energy , one- and two - neutron separation energies , charge , proton and neutron radii , neutron pairing gap and quadrupole deformation .",
    "we have also performed similar calculations for @xmath1 which is in the surroundings of @xmath0 .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way : in section 2 , we briefly present the hartree - fock - bogoliubov method .",
    "some details about the numerical calculations are presented in section 3 , while in section 4 , we present our results and discussion .",
    "a conclusion is given in section 5 .",
    "the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) @xcite framework has been extensively discussed in the literature @xcite and will be briefly introduced here .",
    "+ in hfb method , a two - body hamiltonian of a system of fermions can be expressed in terms of a set of annihilation and creation operators @xmath2 : @xmath3 with the first term corresponding to the kinetic energy and @xmath4 are anti - symmetrized two - body interaction matrix - elements .",
    "so , the ground - state wave function @xmath5 is defined as the quasi - particle vacuum @xmath6 , in which the quasi - particle operators @xmath7 are connected to the original particle ones via a linear bogoliubov transformation : @xmath8 which can be rewritten in the matrix form as : @xmath9 the matrices u and v satisfy the relations : @xmath10    in terms of the normal @xmath11 and pairing @xmath12 one - body density matrices , defined as : @xmath13 the expectation value of the hamiltonian ( [ eq1 ] ) is expressed as an energy functional @xmath14=\\frac{\\langle\\phi|h|\\phi\\rangle}{\\langle\\phi|\\phi\\rangle}= \\textrm{tr}[(e+\\frac{1}{2}\\gamma)\\rho]-\\frac{1}{2}\\textrm{tr}[\\delta\\kappa^ { * } ] \\label{energyfunctional}\\ ] ] where + @xmath15 the variation of the energy ( [ energyfunctional ] ) with respect to @xmath11 and @xmath12 leads to the hfb equations : @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 denote the pairing potential and lagrange multiplier , introduced to fix the correct average particle number , respectively .",
    "+ it should be stressed that the energy functional ( [ energyfunctional ] ) contains terms that can not be simply related to some prescribed effective interaction @xcite . in terms of skyrme forces ,",
    "the hfb energy ( [ energyfunctional ] ) has the form of local energy density functional :    @xmath19=\\int d^{3}\\textrm{h}(\\textbf{r } ) , \\label{skyrmeefunctional}\\ ] ]    where ( * r * ) is the sum of the mean field and pairing energy densities .",
    "the variation of the energy ( [ skyrmeefunctional ] ) according to the particle local density @xmath11 and pairing local density @xmath20 results in the skyrme hfb equations :    @xmath21    where @xmath18 is the chemical potential . the local fields @xmath22 and @xmath23 can be calculated in coordinate space .",
    "details can be found in refs .",
    "in this work , the ground - state properties of even - even and odd @xmath24 have been reproduced by using the code hfbtho ( v2.00d ) @xcite which utilizes the axial transformed harmonic oscillator ( tho ) single - particle basis to expand quasi - particle wave functions .",
    "it iteratively diagonalizes the hartree - fock - bogoliubov hamiltonian based on generalized skyrme - like energy densities and zero - range pairing interactions until a self - consistent solution is found .",
    "calculations were performed with the sly4 skyrme functional @xcite as in ref .",
    "@xcite , and by using the same parameters as in our previous paper i @xcite : a mixed surface - volume pairing with identical pairing strength for both protons and neutrons , and a quasi - particle cutoff of @xmath25 .",
    "the harmonic oscillator basis was characterized by the oscillator length @xmath26 which means that the code automatically sets @xmath27 by using the relation @xmath28 , with @xmath29 .",
    "the number of oscillator shells taken into account was @xmath30 , the total number of states in the basis @xmath31 , and the value of the deformation @xmath32 is taken from the column @xmath33 of the ref .",
    "the number of gauss - laguerre and gauss - hermite quadrature points was @xmath34 , and the number of gauss - legendre points for the integration of the coulomb potential was @xmath35 @xcite .    in the case of odd isotopes ,",
    "calculations are made by using the blocking of quasi - particle states @xcite .",
    "the time - reversal symmetry is , by construction , conserved in hfbtho ( v2.00d ) , the blocking prescription is implemented in the equal filling approximation , and the time - odd fields of the skyrme functional are identically zero .",
    "the identification of the blocking candidate is done using the same technique as in hfodd @xcite : the mean - field hamiltonian @xmath36 is diagonalized at each iteration and provides a set of equivalent single - particle states .",
    "based on the nilsson quantum numbers of the requested blocked level provided in the input file , the code identifies the index of the quasi - particle ( q.p . ) to be blocked by looking at the overlap between the q.p .",
    "wave - function ( both lower and upper component separately ) and the s.p .",
    "wave - function .",
    "the maximum overlap specifies the index of the blocked q.p . @xcite .",
    "the different parameters sets of skyrme forces for prediction of the nuclear ground - state properties are given in @xcite .",
    "sly4 @xcite parameters set used in this study is shown in table [ table1 ] .    .sly4",
    "parameters set.[table1 ] [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for nuclei with @xmath37 , both the double and single neutron separation energies are quite small , and @xmath38 of these nuclei with odd mass numbers are almost zero or negative . the two neutron drip - line nucleus is predicted by our calculations to be @xmath39 and @xmath40 for @xmath0 and @xmath1 isotopes , respectively .",
    "another well - known characteristic shown in fig .",
    "[ sn ] is that even nuclei have @xmath38 greater than their odd neighbors , this is what explains the fluctuations seen in fig .",
    "[ sn ] .      in fig .",
    "[ rc ] , the root mean square charge radii , @xmath41 , ( which are calculated using @xmath42 , where @xmath41 and @xmath43 are charge and proton radii , respectively ) are shown .",
    "the available experimental data @xcite , the predictions of rmf theory @xcite and the hfb calculations based on the d1s gogny force @xcite are also shown in fig .[rc ] for comparison .    from fig .",
    "[ rc ] , a good agreement between theory and experiment can be clearly seen .",
    "one can also see that the charge radii for nuclei heavier than the closed neutron shell , @xmath44 , start increasing with addition of neutrons .",
    "[ r ] shows the neutron and proton radii of @xmath0 and @xmath1 isotopes obtained in our calculations .",
    "hfb calculations based on the d1s gogny force @xcite are shown for comparison as well as results of the relativistic hartree - bogoliubov ( rhb ) model with the dd - me2 effective interaction calculated by using the code dirhbz @xcite .",
    "we have plotted neutron and proton radii ( @xmath45 and @xmath43 ) together in order to see the difference between them .    as it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ r ] , the difference between the neutron and proton rms radii starts to increase with the increase of the neutron number , in favor of developing a neutron skin .",
    "this difference reaches @xmath46 fm for @xmath47mo and @xmath48 fm for @xmath49ru , which can be considered as an indication of possible neutron halo in @xmath0 and @xmath1 isotopes .",
    "but near the @xmath32-stability line ( @xmath50 ) , the neutron and proton radii are almost the same .",
    "the pairing gap is not directly accessible in experiments .",
    "therefore , there are various finite - difference formulas in the literature , which are often interpreted as a measure of the empirical pairing gap , such as :    the three - point difference formula @xcite : @xmath51 \\label{delta3}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the neutron and proton numbers and @xmath54 is the binding energy ( negative ) of the nucleus .",
    "@xmath55 is the number parity .",
    "another commonly used relation is the four - point difference formula @xcite : @xmath56 \\label{delta4}\\ ] ]    the next order corresponds to the five - point difference formula @xcite : @xmath57 \\end{split } \\label{delta5}\\ ] ]    in fig .",
    "[ gap ] , the neutron pairing gaps obtained in our hfb calculations are compared to the experimental data as it has been done in ref .",
    "@xcite with spectral gaps @xmath58 .",
    "the experimental values are calculated from the binding energies given in ref .",
    "@xcite by using the three - point @xmath59 , the four - point @xmath60 and the five - point @xmath61 formulas , respectively .    from fig .",
    "[ gap ] , it can be clearly seen the overall closeness of our calculations with experimental data .",
    "the differences between our results and the experimental data are due to the fact that the pairing gaps obtained in our hfb calculations are effective gaps defined in hfbtho as the mean value of the pairing field @xmath62 with @xmath11 is the normal one - body density matrix and @xmath17 is the pairing field @xcite .",
    "such defined effective gaps have the same behavior as the spectral gaps in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "also , our calculated gaps are exactly zero for closed shell nuclei @xmath44 , @xmath63 and their adjacent odd - mass number nuclei as in figure 4 of the ref .",
    "this is because , at the hfb approximation , the pairing correlations automatically vanish in the case of magic nuclei .",
    "the pairing field becomes zero , so the average value of this field vanishes also , which corresponds to a maximum value of the gaps given by the empirical formulas [ delta3 ] , [ delta4 ] and [ delta5 ] .",
    "another remark that can be seen in this figure is that even - even nuclei have larger gaps than odd - mass nuclei , this is due to the blocking of one state in the odd - mass nucleus .",
    "the blocked state does not contribute to the pairing potential , leading to overall smaller single particle gaps @xcite .",
    "the deformation is an extremely important property for nuclei , it plays a crucial role in determining their properties such as quadrupole moment , nuclear sizes and isotope shifts .",
    "the deformation can also make a deformed shape more favored than the spherical one for certain nuclei by increasing the nuclear binding energy .    in fig .",
    "[ beta ] , we plot the quadrupole deformation parameter , @xmath33 , for @xmath0 and @xmath1 isotopes .",
    "the results of our calculations are compared with the available experimental data @xcite and results of hfb calculations based on the d1s gogny force @xcite .",
    "it must be stressed that fig .",
    "[ beta ] does not indicate the sign of the quadrupole deformation parameter @xmath33 .    as it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ beta ] , the agreement between our calculations and the experimental data is quite good in general .",
    "the @xmath33 values show minima at the magic neutron numbers @xmath44 and @xmath63 as expected , because nearly all nuclei with @xmath44 or @xmath63 are spherical .",
    "nuclei below and above these two magic neutron numbers show an interesting change of shape . for nuclei above @xmath44 , the prolate deformation increases and then saturates at a value close to @xmath64 for both @xmath0 and @xmath1 isotopic chains , and for nuclei below @xmath63 , there is a transition from deformed to spherical shape .",
    "therefore , the regions where nuclei are moderately deformed are @xmath65 and @xmath66 for @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "in this work , we have studied two of the most interesting isotopic chains in the periodic table , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , for a wide range of neutron numbers .",
    "calculations have been performed by using hfb method with sly4 skyrme force and a new generalized formula for pairing strength @xmath67 for neutrons and protons .",
    "the results of these calculations reproduce the available experimental data very well including binding energy per nucleon , the one- and two - neutron separation energies , proton , neutron and charge radii , neutron pairing gap and quadrupole deformation .",
    "the parabolic behavior of the be / a has been well reproduced in respect to the experimental curve .",
    "a possible neutron halo has been observed in both @xmath0 and @xmath1 isotopes .",
    "the last stable nucleus against neutron emission was found to be @xmath39 for @xmath0 isotopes , and @xmath40 for @xmath1 isotopes .",
    "indications on shape phase transition for both isotopic chains were given .",
