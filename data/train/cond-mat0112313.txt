    "there is a growing interest in the microscopic structure of the vortex lattice ( vl ) in superconducting films with artificially fabricated columnar defects . in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field and zero current",
    "this structure depends on how strong is the pinning force produced by the defects with respect to the internal elastic forces of the vl .",
    "this results in two possible situations : commensurate and incommensurate lattice , depending on the pinning landscape being strong enough to determine the vl structure or not .",
    "many experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite works have reported maxima in the critical current @xmath0 and field dependent magnetic moment @xmath1 in the points of the phase diagram where a commensurate state takes place .",
    "when a finite current stronger than @xmath0 is applied , an additional ingredient governs the structural evolution of the vl . in the center of mass ( cm ) frame ,",
    "the vortices interact with a time dependent pinning potential , which is determined by the cm velocity . as the driving current",
    "is increased from @xmath0 , a variety of dynamical phases is possible . but",
    "commensurate ordered lattices are only possible at very high driving forces , when the pinning potential is averaged in the direction of motion becoming a static washboard potential .",
    "recently , carneiro @xcite has shown by numerical simulations that at a high enough temperature this ordered state is reached at a finite driving force .",
    "frequently , these phenomena have been investigated under the assumption of infinite sample , i.e. no surface or geometrical effects are taken into account .",
    "as it is well known , surface effects can play an important and even a dominant role on the irreversible properties of a superconducting specimen . in the critical state approach , kuznetsov _",
    "@xcite estimated the enhancement due to edge effects of hysteresis in magnetization of thin strips with strong pinning .",
    "the penetration of flux in finite sample are also described by the geometric barrier model @xcite , which has shown to be successful in describing the irreversible properties of flat high-@xmath2 single crystals @xcite at high temperatures .",
    "all these continuum models however are not able to determine structural details of the vl and their relevance in the macroscopic response .    in the present work ,",
    "we propose a simple qualitative description of individual vortices dynamics in superconducting strips .",
    "the vortex - vortex interactions and the edge barrier are calculated in the frame work of the screened coulomb model @xcite . with a change of scale",
    "the problem may be mapped into the well known problem of an infinite slab under a parallel field .",
    "the calculated @xmath1 presents a series of maxima corresponding to matching of the vl in the pinning structure and a strong assymetry of the upward ( virgin ) and downward brenches , which charactere the surface effects .",
    "we also study the dynamics of the vl when a transport current is applied accross the strip .",
    "the strong current inhomogenity leads to different dynamics in different regions of the strip .",
    "we describe the motion of vortices in a superconducting strip of thickness @xmath3 much smaller than the london penetration depth @xmath4 .",
    "the geometry and coordinate system are depicted in fig .",
    "the vortex equation of motion , appropriate for overdamped dynamics , is @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the instantaneous terminal velocity of vortex @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the total lorentz force , @xmath9 is the pinning potential and @xmath10 is a gaussian langevin force acting on vortex @xmath7 at instant @xmath11 .",
    "the lorentz force acting on a vortex line is defined by the total sheet current @xmath12 probed by this vortex , @xmath13 .",
    "a difficult task is to precisely determine an expression for @xmath14 in this system .",
    "recently , brandt has generalized the continuum theory to account for the penetration depth and numerically calculated the stream lines of current of vortices in thin films and washers in the small @xmath15 limit @xcite .",
    "a usefull procedure is to write the sheet current in terms of a scalar potential , the stream function @xmath16 satisfying the zero divergence of the current @xcite : @xmath17 .",
    "note that there is a close relation between the stream lines probed by a vortex and the energy of this vortex @xcite .",
    "this is clear when we rewrite the lorentz force as @xmath18 . with the help of the biot - savart law , the london equation for a vortex located at @xmath19 in the @xmath20 plane of a thin strip under a perpendicular field @xmath21",
    "may be written as @xmath22    where @xmath23 is a kernel with a suitable cutoff to account for the finite sample thickness @xcite .",
    "we propose a simple way of calculating @xmath24 , using a screened coulomb model approach , suitable for describing thin - film vortices with @xmath15 comparable to the system dimension @xcite . in this large-@xmath15 limit ,",
    "the screening length @xmath25 is identified with the smaller of @xmath15 and some linear dimension of the sample .",
    "therefore , for thin strips with @xmath26 , we use a nonhomogeneous helmholtz equation instead of solving the exact , although much more complicated , eq . [ london ] . using the boundary condition @xmath27 at the edges ,",
    "this problem is similar to that of a superconducting slab under a parallel field @xcite . here , we add periodic boundary conditions ( with periodicity @xmath28 ) in the @xmath29 direction . solving for a single vortex ,",
    "one obtains the vortex - vortex interaction energy :     vs. magnetic field @xmath21 for the thin strip with pinning strength @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath31 is in units of @xmath32 and @xmath21 in units of @xmath33 .",
    "inset : system geometry and coordinate system . ]    @xmath34    where @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "the tilded length quantities are normalized by @xmath25 . with a suitable cutoff to account for the vortex core ,",
    "one obtains the vortex self - energy : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the coherence length .",
    "now , solving for the external field @xmath21 , we have @xmath39 .",
    "\\label{vh}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equations ( [ vself ] ) and ( [ vh ] ) form the edge barrier for flux entry . thus",
    ", the lorentz force on a vortex @xmath40 due to a vortex @xmath41 and an external field @xmath21 , for instance , is given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 .",
    "in the above framework , we simulated @xmath1 measurements on a thin strip with @xmath44 . a square lattice of columnar defects ( slcd ) is represented by a periodic arrangement of gaussian wells with radius @xmath45 and period @xmath46 .",
    "the depth of the wells is varied from @xmath47 to @xmath48 .",
    "the simulations are carried out using the same procedure as in ref .",
    "@xcite : at each time step a vortex is attempted to nucleate in some random point in a line which is a distance @xmath38 from one of the strip edges .",
    "here we take @xmath49 .",
    "the magnetic moment was calculated using @xmath50 , which for the chosen gauge of @xmath27 at the edges is simply @xmath51 .",
    ": ( a ) @xmath52 ( upward branch ) , ( b ) @xmath53 ( downward ) , ( c ) @xmath54 ( upward ) , and ( d ) @xmath55 ( downward ) .",
    "the hollow circles represent the pinning lattice . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is shown the first @xmath1 half cycle for @xmath56 .",
    "this curve depicts features of both bulk pinning due to regularly arranged deffects and edge effects . matching peaks",
    "are present , but behave differently in the upward ( virgin ) and downward branches . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , these peaks correspond to hystory dependent states of commensuration . in upward field",
    ", the edge barrier imposes a vortex free region which produces vacant pinning sites even in the second matching configuration . in downward field , these states are similar to those expected for infinite samples , no vortex free region is present .",
    "this points up the different dynamics of flux entrance and exit .",
    "we have also simulated measurements of the time averaged cm velocity of the vl as a transport sheet current @xmath57 was varied .",
    "the current is apllied along the @xmath29 direction and the contacts are considered to be far away from the region studied , in such a way to guarantee zero current divergence in this region .",
    "the current distribution in the strip width may be calculated from the helmholtz equation for @xmath58 with the condition that @xmath58 must be an odd function and that @xmath59 ( current continuity ) .",
    "thus the potential energy due to @xmath57 is @xmath60     in the central third of the strip for pinning strengths @xmath47,0 .25 , 0.5 , 0.75 , and 1.0@xmath61 ( from top to botton ) .",
    "panels : density - density correlation functions for @xmath62 and different current values ( arrows ) . ]",
    "the simulation procedure is the same as described in the preceeding section .",
    "we divide the strip in three regions of width @xmath25 .",
    "we computed the time - averaged cm velocity @xmath63 in each region as a function of the transport current after the field has been ramped up to @xmath64 . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we show the current dependence of @xmath63 in the central region for different pinning strengths varying from @xmath47 to @xmath48 . as expected , there is a finite critical current for zero pinning , since the edge barrier pins the vl . for nonzero pinning , two regimes of motion",
    "are identified : in the low current regime the interstitial vortices are depinned and start moving ; at higher value of @xmath57 all the lattice is moving .",
    "as shown by the density - density correlation function of the vortices position ( panels of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , no reordering occur in the current range studied .",
    "reordering would be expected at least for weak pinning since the temperature used in the simulations is a small fraction of the zero - drive melting temperature . but here , lattice ordering is contaminated by the random nature of flux penetration through the surface barrier . however , long range time order was observed .",
    "we have described the dynamics of vortices in narrrow superconducting strips in the screened coulomb model approach .",
    "we calculated the vortex - vortex interaction energy and the interaction with an edge barrier . in this scenario , we carried out simulations on vortex motion in field ramp measurements of the magnetic moment and i - v characteristics using langevin dynamics .",
    "the @xmath1 curves evidenced the strong influence of the edge barrier in the vl configuration in upward field , where the first matching states are not fully accomplished in the entire sample .",
    "for the i - v characteristics , we observed that the edge barrier represents an effective pinning for the vl as expected , and ordered motion of the vl is disturbed by the random penetration of vortices .",
    "a more detailed study will be reported elsewhere .",
