    "in this paper we study the expansion of the substructural logic fl@xmath0 , i.e.  full lambek calculus with exchange and weakening , with a unary connective @xmath1 whose intended algebraic semantics is as follows : given a bounded integral commutative residuated lattice ( or residuated lattice for short ) * a * , @xmath2 is the maximum , if it exists , of the boolean elements of the universe @xmath3 below @xmath4 , which we call _ the greatest boolean below a _ , that is , @xmath5 in fact , this operator is similar to the so - called baaz - monteiro @xmath6 operator , very often used in the context of mathematical fuzzy logic systems that are semilinear expansions of mtl .",
    "baaz @xcite studied it in connection with gdel logic while hjek @xcite investigated @xmath6 in bl logics in general , see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 2 ) for a more general perspective . indeed , in such a context of semilinear logics , i.e. logics that are complete with respect to a class of linearly ordered algebras , the semantics of @xmath6 is exactly the above one for @xmath1 : in a linearly - ordered mtl - algebra , @xmath7 if @xmath8 , and @xmath9 otherwise , since the only boolean elements in a chain are 1 and 0 ; moreover , from a logical point of view , @xmath10 represents the weakest boolean proposition implying @xmath11 .",
    "the operator @xmath1 can be also related to the join - complement operation @xmath12 , also known as dual intuitionistic negation , already considered by skolem @xcite in the context of lattices with relative meet - complement , and later independently studied by e.g. moisil @xcite and rauszer @xcite as well , the latter in the context of expansions of heyting algebras .",
    "it turns out that the operation @xmath13 and its iterations , where @xmath14 is the residual negation , has also very similar properties to @xmath1 , and in some classes of residuated lattices they even coincide .    in this paper",
    "we study the operator @xmath1 in the context of fl@xmath0 and axiomatize it .",
    "we show that the usual axiomatics of the @xmath6 operator is actually too strong to capture the above intended semantics .",
    "in fact , the axiom @xmath15 is not sound for @xmath1 over fl@xmath0 any longer .",
    "thus , @xmath1 is a weaker operator than @xmath6 .",
    "however , as we will see , @xmath1 keeps most of the properties of @xmath6 .",
    "in particular , the expansion of fl@xmath0 with @xmath1 is conservative , its corresponding class of algebras is an equational class , and has the same kind of deduction theorem as @xmath6 .",
    "also , @xmath1 may also be interesting as @xmath16 has a paraconsistent behaviour .",
    "on the negative side , the expansion of a semilinear extension of fl@xmath0 with @xmath1 needs not to remain semilinear .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section 2",
    "we overview well - known facts about residuated lattices and its boolean elements , as well as basic facts about the logic fl@xmath0 .",
    "sections 3 and 4 contain an algebraic study of the operator @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , in section 3 we study basic properties and show , among other things , that the class @xmath17 of residuated lattices expanded with @xmath1 is an equational class and state the modalities , while in section 4 we compare @xmath1 with the mentioned @xmath6 and with an operation using the join - complement @xmath12 .",
    "finally , in section 5 we focus on logical aspects , introducing the logic fl@xmath18 , i.e. the expansion of fl@xmath0 with the operator @xmath1 , and show that is a conservative expansion and has the finite model property , and hence it is decidable .",
    "we conclude with some remarks and open problems .",
    "we give appropriate references .",
    "however , the paper is self - contained .",
    "in this section we recall some properties of residuated lattices as well as of their boolean elements that we will use in the following sections .",
    "following @xcite , a bounded , integral , commutative residuated lattice , or residuated lattice for short , is an algebra * a*@xmath19 of type @xmath20 such that :    * @xmath21 is a bounded lattice with @xmath22 , for all @xmath23 , * @xmath24 is a commutative monoid ( i.e. @xmath25 is commutative , associative , with unit @xmath26 ) , and * @xmath27 is the residuum of @xmath25 , i.e. , + @xmath28 iff @xmath29 , for all @xmath30 ,    where @xmath31 is the order given by the lattice structure .",

    "the class of residuated lattices will be denoted by @xmath33 .",
    "it is well known that @xmath33 is an equational class and that it constitutes the algebraic semantics of the substructural logic fl@xmath0 ( see section [ flew ] ) .    [ 5 ] in what follows we will have occasion to refer several times to the residuated lattice structure defined on the five - element lattice of figure [ five - godel ] by taking @xmath34 and @xmath35 its residuum . with these operations , it actually becomes a five element gdel algebra , that is , a residuated lattice with @xmath25 being idempotent and satisfying the pre - linearity law @xmath36 .",
