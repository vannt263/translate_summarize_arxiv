    "polar - ring galaxies ( prgs ) represent a rare class of peculiar objects containing a ring or annulus of gas , stars and dust orbiting in a plane nearly perpendicular to the equatorial plane of the host galaxy .",
    "this unique geometry of prgs gives an ideal opportunity to investigate the shape of their 3d gravitational potential .",
    "typically , the host galaxy looks like a galaxy of early morphological type but with some peculiarities in color and brightness distribution ; sometimes these properties let this component more similar to a late - type object rather than to an s0 galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recently polar rings ( prs ) have also been found around spiral galaxies ngc  660 @xcite and ugc  5600 @xcite .",
    "the main properties of polar rings ( compiled by @xcite ) are similar to those of spiral arms : blue color , plenty of gas and dust , prominent star forming regions , and disk - like rotation .    according to the most popular point of view ,",
    "prgs are the result of galaxy interaction , ranging from simple gas accretion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to complete merger @xcite .",
    "both hypotheses are investigated in detail by @xcite .",
    "the authors conclude that both scenarios may explain the prgs formation but the accretion one is preferable because some predictions relative to the merging scenario ( such as the stellar halo around the polar ring ) are not observed .",
    "alternatively , polar rings can represent the delayed inflows of primordial gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    intensive studies of this strange objects have been started after publication of the atlas and catalogue of prgs and candidates for these objects @xcite , though strong emission lines in the spectra of prs were detected before ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the presence of hii - regions in the prs of some nearby galaxies , such as ngc  2685 @xcite and ngc  4650a @xcite , the optical colors and h@xmath5 luminosities of the rings @xcite as well as high ir - fluxes of prgs @xcite suggest a presence of active star formation in prs .",
    "we present here a deep optical study based on _ hst _ wfpc2 archival data of the resolved stellar populations of two nearby prgs , ngc  2685 ( d@xmath6  mpc ) , and ngc  4650a ( d@xmath7  mpc ) ( h@xmath8  = 75  km / s / mpc ) .",
    "multi - color stellar photometry provides the opportunity to study directly the resolved stellar populations of different masses , ages and chemical abundances .",
    "the analysis of the stellar distribution on color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) is the most powerful way to investigate population fractions and their spatial variations , to estimate the galaxy distance , and to provide clues to its star formation history ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "both galaxies were included by @xcite in the group of most probable prgs , a , having two well - established orthogonal kinematic systems on the basis of optical @xcite and radio - hi observations @xcite .",
    "the important difference between these galaxies is that the polar ring of ngc  2685 is comparable in size to the host galaxy , while ngc  4650a has a polar ring extended out to more than two radii of the host galaxy .",
    "ngc  2685 ( arp  336 , also known as `` the helix galaxy  and ' ' the spindle  )",
    "has long been known as an unusual object @xcite .",
    "[ f : fig1 ] presents its image taken from the the digitized sky survey .",
    "@xcite pointed to the singularity of ngc  2685 , and later @xcite included the galaxy in his atlas of peculiar galaxies .",
    "the main body of the galaxy having a spindle - like shape is twisted by luminous filaments ( rings ) traced by dark strips on the central galaxy .",
    "deep images ( see @xcite ) reveal an outer extended low luminosity elliptical structure ( outer ring ) with position angle close to that of the galaxy major axis .",
    "the combination of photometric @xcite and spectroscopic @xcite data shows that ngc  2685 is most likely an edge - on s0 galaxy with rings ( helices ) rotating approximately perpendicular to the main optical disk .",
    "the hi map @xcite also shows an extended structure coincided with outer ring .",
    "one small , 16th magnitude galaxy lies within 10(36  kpc in projection ) of ngc  2685 and two more faint , small galaxies are within 20@xcite .",
    "if they are not background objects , then the gas capture during the galactic interaction might produce such a peculiar morphology .",
    "galaxy ngc  4650a ( fig .",
    "[ f : fig2 ] ) is a prototype of prgs with extraordinary extended polar ring @xcite .",
    "its structure was investigated in detail in many works ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as in the case of ngc  2685 the central galaxy of ngc  4650a looks like an edge - on s0 galaxy but just this galaxy has peculiar brightness distribution and colors .",
    "the ring , which is about @xmath9 times the size of the central disk , is inclined with @xmath10 angle to the galaxy s major axis .",
    "the dark strip of absorption is visible at the place where ring is projected on the central galaxy .",
    "the ring itself has a complex structure : in the central part it is inclined to the line of sight and both parts are visible ; howere , at the distance of @xmath11 , they supposedly overlap when the ring become seen as edge - on .",
    "some of separate filaments are visible in the outer regions of the ring . according to @xcite the ring demonstrates some signs of spiral structure .",
    "data available in the literature concerning the color of ngc  2685 polar ring are inconsistent .",
    "in @xcite it has been shown on the basis of @xmath12 surface photometry that a color of the ring is typical for the spiral arms of @xmath13 galaxies .",
    "@xcite found later that rings color is close to that of central galaxy , i.e. is red .",
    "however , this result is unclear due to uncertainty of transformation of their @xmath14 and @xmath15 mag to the standard johnson @xmath16 magnitude photometric system without taking into account the large radiation contribution of the emission lines .",
    "the color of ngc  4650a polar ring is blue : @xmath17  @xmath18 , according to @xcite or @xmath17  @xmath19 , according to @xcite .",
    "both galaxies were observed in the co line @xmath20 @xcite .",

    "@xcite have found that @xcite overestimated the h@xmath21 mass in ngc  2685 by an order of magnitude .",
    "nevertheless , both galaxies have sufficient molecular clouds for star forming activity .",
    "there are some papers containing the claims on stellar populations and therefore the ages of polar rings @xcite .",
    "for all the cases , results of surface photometry were used . in @xcite the age of the ngc",
    "2685 ring was estimated as @xmath23 5 - 6  gyr on the basis of its color ( however , these data are uncertain , see above ) . as for ngc  4650a the data on ring colors show that the young stellar population certainly exist .",
    "the detailed surface colorimetry of the galaxy was done by @xcite and @xcite . in the first paper",
    "the ages of 1 - 3  gyr for the central region of the host galaxy and @xmath24 yr for polar ring were found , while @xcite claimed that the ages of the host galaxy and the ring are 3 - 5  gyr and @xmath23 1  gyr , correspondingly .",
    "a study of different stellar populations of the polar rings , using their cmds , will cast light on the origin and evolution of prgs .",
    "we made here the first attempt to investigate the stellar population of polar rings in ngc  2685 and ngc  4650a in such a way .",
    "we make use of archival hst / wfpc2 data of ngc  2685 and ngc  4650a .",

    "<S> we present the results of stellar photometry of polar - ring galaxies ngc  2685 and ngc  4650a , using the archival data obtained with the hubble space telescope s wide field planetary camera 2 . </S>",
    "<S> polar rings of these galaxies were resolved into @xmath0 and @xmath1 stellar objects in the @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 bands , considerable part of which are blue supergiants located in the young stellar complexes . </S>",
    "<S> the stellar features in the cm - diagrams are best represented by isochrones with metallicity z = 0.008 . </S>",
    "<S> the process of star formation in the polar rings of both galaxies was continuous and the age of the youngest detected stars is about 9 myr for ngc 2685 and 6.5 myr for ngc 4650a . </S>"
