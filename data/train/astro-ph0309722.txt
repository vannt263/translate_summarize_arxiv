    "one of the most challenging issues of modern physics is the quantization of the gravitational interaction . within this theoretical framework",
    "it is worth noticing that although the controversial issue of the variation of the fundamental couplings dates back to the large - number hypothesis of dirac @xcite , it has recently become a subject of intensive experimental and theoretical studies  see @xcite for an excellent review .",
    "modern theories , like the string / m - theory or brane models , do not necessarily require a variation of the fundamental constants but they provide a natural and self - consistent framework for such variations . most of such theories assume the existence of additional dimensions of the space - time and , therefore , contain a built - in mechanism allowing for the time variation of the observed couplings in four dimensions .",
    "this feature is rather easy to understand . within the multidimensional approach",
    "the interactions are described by a fundamental theory formulated in @xmath3 dimensions , and the conventional four - dimensional theory appears as a result of the dimensional reduction .",
    "couplings in four dimensions are determined by a set of a few constants of the multidimensional theory and the size @xmath4 of the space of extra dimensions .",
    "the multidimensional constants are assumed to be genuinely fundamental and , consequently , do not vary with time . on the other hand ,",
    "in the cosmological or astrophysical context it is natural to assume that @xmath4 varies with time , very much in the same way as the scale factor of the three - dimensional space does .",
    "this leads to the time variation of parameters of the effective four - dimensional theory , like the gravitational constant @xmath0 and fine structure constant @xmath1 @xcite@xcite .",
    "moreover , since their time dependences are given by the same scale factor @xmath4 these variations may turn out to be correlated , and it is natural to wonder what kind of relation is predicted in multidimensional scenarios .",
    "the effect of these correlations for various couplings in the framework of theories of unification has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "it has also been suggested that these correlations may unveil the mechanism of the time variation of the couplings and , in this way , give insight into the underlying fundamental theory .",
    "it is important to emphasize that a variation of the fundamental couplings may lead to deeper consequences or effects in the theory of particle interactions .",
    "in particular , it has been shown that a variation of fundamental couplings can be intrinsically related to the lorentz and cpt violation @xcite .",
    "there have been several attempts to measure the rate of variation of the fundamental constants but many of them have yielded just upper bounds on the absolute value of the rate of change .",
    "however , very recently , the rate of variation of the fine structure constant has been measured using high resolution spectroscopy of qso absorption systems . to be specific a non - zero detection of the variation of the fine structure constant , @xmath5 at @xmath6 , has been reported @xcite .",
    "although this result is still the subject of strong debate it is worth studying its theoretical and observational consequences .",
    "in addition , the observations of high redshift @xmath7 type ia supernovae @xcite and the analysis of the cmb strongly suggest a flat , @xmath8 , universe @xcite , with a mass density @xmath9 and a non - vanishing cosmological constant @xmath10 . this result , in turn , motivated a considerable amount of papers looking for viable alternatives . amongst these alternatives",
    "the variability of the gravitational constant was one of the proposed alternatives @xcite to reconcile the observational data of distant supernovae with an open @xmath11 universe .",
    "as it has been argued in @xcite , models in which the time variation of couplings  and in particular of the fine structure constant  is generated by the dynamics of a cosmological scalar field face serious difficulties .",
    "namely , using rather general arguments , these authors show that in order to explain the observations of @xcite such models require an extremely precise fine - tuning that can not be explained by any known mechanism .",
    "the problem is essentially the huge back - reaction produced by varying couplings on the vacuum energy .",
    "this difficulty could be intimately related to the long - standing cosmological constant problem .",
    "hence , its satisfactory solution could also provide a mechanism to suppress the enormous variation of the vacuum energy due to the time variation of @xmath1 , but this is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "having adopted this point of view , we do not discuss this issue furthermore in the present work .",
    "instead , the aim of the our work is to derive the relations between @xmath12 and @xmath13 in various models in @xmath14 space - time dimensions and to confront them with the observational data , namely to compare the detected variation of the fine structure constant @xcite with the existing bounds on the variation of @xmath0 at cosmological distances .",
    "the models we are going to consider include the classical kaluza - klein models  see @xcite for reviews on the subject  models with multidimensional gravitational and yang - mills fields @xcite , and the randall - sundrum model with two branes and gauge and fermionic fields propagating in the bulk @xcite@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ kkmodels ] formulae for the time variation of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in various models",
    "are derived . in section [ observ ]",
    "we use our theoretical results and the experimental value for @xmath13 @xcite to obtain an estimate of the rate @xmath12 , which is then confronted with the data obtained from distant type ia supernovae @xcite . finally , in section [ conclusions ] conclusions and some discussion of the results are presented .",
    "in this section we consider theories with extra spatial dimensions . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we assume that the geometry of the space of additional dimensions is described by just one scale factor @xmath4 . in most of the cases the generalization to geometries with a few scales is straightforward and does not bring any qualitatively new features to the effect we are going to study .",
    "moreover , the theories studied here are assumed to be part of a cosmological scenario with varying @xmath4 .",
    "the specific form of the function @xmath15 depends on the details of the scenario  see , for instance , @xcite .",
    "here we simply assume that the evolution of the multidimensional universe at the cosmological scale is described by some scenario which predicts certain background metric with varying scale @xmath15 .",
    "another possible class of scenarios would be the ones postulating a first order phase transition in the universe .",
    "however , we will not consider this last possibility here and we limit ourselves to multidimensional theories describing the time variation of @xmath0 and @xmath1 which fulfill the following conditions : ( 1 ) the four - dimensional effective theory  that is , the dimensionally reduced theory  includes both einstein gravity and maxwell electrodynamics ; and ( 2 ) the time variation of the scale factor @xmath15 of the space of extra dimensions leads to the time variation of both the gravitational constant @xmath0 and the fine structure constant @xmath1 . to calculate @xmath12 and @xmath13 we focus only on the gravitational and electromagnetic sectors of the reduced theory .",
    "these time variations as well as that of @xmath15 are supposed to be slow enough in comparison with the phenomena described by these sectors  namely , the electromagnetic processes at the microscopic level",
    ". our analysis will be rather general and will not rely on any particular function @xmath15 .",
    "in two pioneering papers @xcite t. kaluza and o. klein formulated the essential elements of the multidimensional approach to the description of fundamental interactions which was later called the kaluza - klein approach .",
    "they considered the pure einstein gravity in five - dimensional space time @xmath16 described by the multidimensional metric tensor @xmath17 and showed that the sector of zero modes of the dimensionally reduced theory includes the four - dimensional gravity and maxwell theory . here",
    "@xmath18 is the four - dimensional minkowski space - time , and @xmath19 is the circle .",
    "later this construction was generalized @xcite to more general compact spaces of extra dimensions . in these cases",
    "the reduced theory contains einstein gravity and yang - mills fields with the gauge group determined by the isometry group of the space of extra dimensions . in the standard setting the multidimensional kaluza - klein theory",
    "is the pure einstein theory on @xmath20 with the action given by s = d^4+d ^(4+d ) .",
    "[ d - grav ] here @xmath21 is a ( curved ) four - dimensional space - time , @xmath22 is a compact manifold of extra dimensions , @xmath23 , ( @xmath24 ) , @xmath25 is the scalar curvature in @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is the multidimensional gravitational constant , which is assumed to be truly constant and does not depend on time .",
    "according to the procedure of dimensional reduction , to obtain the four - dimensional effective theory , firstly the @xmath28-components @xmath29 of the metric tensor are identified as the four - dimensional metric tensor .",
    "certain combinations of the rest of the components , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 with @xmath33 are identified as gauge field multiplets @xmath34 and scalar fields @xmath35 .",
    "secondly , the mode expansion of all these fields is performed  see , for example , @xcite .",
    "the coefficients of the expansion depend only on @xmath36 and are interpreted as four - dimensional fields . in general there is an infinite number of them but here we are interested in the sector containing only zero modes of the mode expansion .",
    "its action is given by s_0 = d^4x , [ dr - action ] where @xmath37 is the four - dimensional gravitational constant .",

    "the scalar fields usually give highly non - linear interaction terms and are coupled non - minimally to the gravitational and gauge fields . for the sake of simplicity , the scalar fields are supposed to be frozen out and their contribution is neglected . identifying the gravitational and gauge couplings from the action @xmath41 for the zero modes we obtain the following expressions for @xmath43 and @xmath44 in terms of @xmath27 and the radius @xmath15 of the space of extra dimensions : g(t ) & = & , [ gg ] + g_i^2(t ) & = & _ i , [ gg ] where @xmath45 is the volume of the space of extra dimensions and @xmath46 are coefficients which depend on the isometry group of @xmath22",
    ". equations ( [ gg ] ) and ( [ gg ] ) should be regarded as leading order approximations .",
    "the terms omitted in the reduced action will give sub - leading corrections , in particular through loop effects .",

    "the situation may improve when , for example , better or additional observational determinations of @xmath13 are obtained or when experimental data from distant supernovae become available in the future ( with missions like snap ) to give more accurate bounds on @xmath12 .",
    "although this is indeed the most straightforward explanation , let us consider other possibilities .",
    "firstly , it may turn out that our consideration of the time variation of the fundamental couplings is too rough and some effects which modify eq .",
    "( [ dag - gen ] ) are missing . and secondly , it could be that the multidimensional models considered here may also be too simple and phenomenologically unsatisfactory and should be substituted by more elaborated ones . in any case , questioning the applicability of the multidimensional approach for the description of the fundamental interactions should be preceded by additional more detailed theoretical studies and should be confronted with more accurate observational data .",
