    "coupled cluster ( cc ) theory  @xcite is perhaps the most powerful method for describing dynamical electron correlation effects within the realm of modern quantum chemistry .",
    "the cc singles and doubles ( ccsd ) model  @xcite , in which the cluster operator is truncated at the level of double excitations , is a robust and useful model , but it is well - known that the effects of triple ( and higher - level ) excitations need to be taken into account in order to obtain highly accurate results that may compete with the accuracy of experiments  @xcite .",
    "however , the steep scaling of the cc singles , doubles , and triples  @xcite ( ccsdt ) and cc singles , doubles , triples , and quadruples  @xcite ( ccsdtq ) models limits their use to rather modest molecular systems . for this reason ,",
    "a computationally tractable alternative to the expensive iterative ccsdt and ccsdtq models is to develop approximate models , for which the important triples and/or quadruples contributions are determined from a perturbation analysis , and hence included in a cheap and non - iterative fashion .",
    "a plethora of different models for the approximate treatment of triples and/or quadruples effects have been suggested , and we refer to ref . for a recent theoretical overview of approximate non - iterative triples and quadruples models and refs . and for a numerical comparison of many of these .",
    "in the present work , we focus on perturbation theory within a cc framework , where a mller - plesset ( mp ) partitioning of the hamiltonian is performed  @xcite , and the energy difference between a zeroth - order ( parent ) cc model and a higher - level ( target ) cc model is expanded in orders of the perturbation ( the fluctuation potential ) . in particular , we will base the perturbation analysis on a bivariational cc lagrangian obtained by adding to the cc target energy the cc amplitude equations with associated lagrange multipliers .",
    "we note that the linearly parametrized state formally spanned by the lagrange multipliers is often referred to as the cc @xmath3-state  @xcite , and that this is in general different from the exponentially parametrized cc state .",
    "as pointed out by arponen  @xcite , extensively exploited in the cc lagrangian formulation@xcite , and recently discussed by kvaal  @xcite , the cc energy may be interpreted as a cc functional in both the cc amplitudes and the @xmath3-state parameters . we will show that the fastest convergence is obtained when these two sets of state parameters are treated on an equal footing in the perturbative expansion of the energy difference between a parent and a target cc model .",
    "thus , we will distinguish between a perturbation expansion of the cc energy , for which only parent amplitudes are used at the expansion point , and a perturbation expansion of the cc lagrangian , for which both parent amplitudes _ and _ parent multipliers are used at the expansion point . at first sight ,",
    "the bivariational lagrangian formulation might seem like an unnecessary complication , since , for the target model , the lagrangian formally equals the energy .",
    "the purpose of this work is , however , to highlight and exemplify that not only is the lagrangian formulation a convenient mathematical tool that may simplify the derivation of various perturbation expansions ; in many cases , the lagrangian formulation will actually lead to different perturbation series than the corresponding energy formulation .    to exemplify this difference , we consider two perturbation series which both expand the difference between the energies of the ccsd and ccsdt models .",
    "we initially introduce the @xmath0 series , in which the ccsd amplitude equations are satisfied at the expansion point , and next compare it to the recently developed @xmath1 series  @xcite , in which not only the ccsd amplitude equations are satisfied at the expansion point , but also the ccsd multiplier equations . despite depending on the fluctuation potential to infinite order in the space of all single and double excitations ,",
    "the ccsd amplitudes are formally considered as zeroth - order parameters in both the @xmath0 and @xmath1 series , since the ccsd model represents the expansion point .",
    "similarly , the ccsd multipliers , which too depend on the fluctuation potential , are considered as zeroth - order parameters for the @xmath1 series , but not so for the @xmath0 series .",
    "the path from the ccsd expansion point towards the ccsdt target energy , as defined by a perturbation expansion , is thus different within the @xmath0 and @xmath1 series , and , as will be shown in the present work , the @xmath1 series is the more rapidly converging of the two , since more information is utilized at the expansion point .",
    "we finally reiterate that the lowest - order contribution of the @xmath1 series ( that of the @xmath4 model ) is identical to the triples - only part of the ccsd(2 ) model of gwaltney and head - gordon  @xcite and the second - order model of the cc(@xmath5)pt(@xmath6 ) series of hirata _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , the @xmath7 model is identical to the triples - only part of the third - order cc(@xmath5)pt(@xmath6 ) model , while for fourth and higher orders , the @xmath1 and cc(@xmath5)pt(@xmath8 ) series are different  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 series , however , differs from the aforementioned perturbation series for all corrections .",
    "+ the present study is outlined as follows . in [ sec : theory ] , we derive the @xmath0 series and compare it to the @xmath1 series in order to illustrate the importance of treating parent amplitudes and multipliers on an equal footing . in [ sec : results ] , we present numerical results for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 energies , while some concluding remarks are given in [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in this section , we consider two perturbation series that expand the difference between the ccsd and ccsdt energies in orders of the perturbation . in",
    "[ sec : eccsdt ] , we develop a new energy - based perturbation series denoted the @xmath0 series , which can be formulated in terms of cc amplitudes without the need for invoking a cc lagrangian .",
    "next , in [ sec : general ] , we develop a common bivariational framework , in which we recast the @xmath0 and @xmath1 series . finally , we present a theoretical comparison between the two series in [ sec : comparison ] in order to exemplify how the cc lagrangian framework may lead to a perturbation series that is inherently different from that which arise from the corresponding energy formulation .      in this work",

    "the @xmath31 amplitudes thus represent corrections to the ccsd amplitudes , while @xmath32 are the ccsdt triples amplitudes .",

    "the two series are therefore different , and the @xmath1 series is found to converge more rapidly towards the ccsdt target energy , since all available information at the ccsd expansion point is utilized .",
    "the presented analysis may be generalized to any perturbation expansion representing the difference between a parent cc model and a higher - level target cc model . for developments of cc perturbation expansions",
    ", we thus generally advocate the use a bivariational lagrangian cc formulation to ensure an optimal rate of convergence in terms of term - wise size extensive corrections towards the target energy .",
    "for example , two perturbation series formulated around the ccsdt energy ( e - ccsdt(q@xmath8 ) ) and ccsdt lagrangian ( ccsdt(q@xmath8 ) ) expansion points , respectively , to describe an expansion towards the ccsdtq target energy in order the mller - plesset fluctuation potential , are also bound to exhibit different rates of convergence , following a similar line of arguments .",
    "+ in quantum chemistry , a lagrangian energy functional has traditionally been viewed merely as a convenient mathematical tool for deriving perturbative expansions , however , one that would give rise to expansions that are identical to those based on the standard energy . the present work highlights how this equivalence between energy- and lagrangian - based perturbation theory only holds whenever the zeroth - order parameters do not depend on the perturbing operator , as is , for example , the case for standard mp perturbation theory where the zeroth - order parameters vanish .",
    "when the zeroth - order parameters are independent of the perturbing operator , a lagrangian formulation is merely of mathematical convenience , but , for perturbation - dependent zeroth - order parameters ( e.g. , like those of the right- ( cc ) and left - hand ( @xmath3 ) eigenstates of a non - hermitian cc similarity - transformed hamiltonian ) , a bivariational lagrangian formulation is in general expected to lead to a faster and more stable convergence than a corresponding energy formulation .",
