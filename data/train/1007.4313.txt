    "@xcite the average formation lengths of high - energy hadrons was studied based on the lund model of hadronization  @xcite .",
    "the ambiguity in the concept of formation length for composite particles was pointed out .",
    "two different formation lengths were defined and their distributions calculated .",
    "the results were compared with the data which allowed to choice suitable form for average formation length .",
    "+ in the ref .",
    "@xcite the investigation of the space - time scales of the hadronization process was continued for the concrete case of pseudoscalar mesons , produced in semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) .",
    "it was shown that the average formation lengths of these hadrons depend from their electrical charges .",
    "in particular the average formation lengths of positively charged mesons are larger than of negatively charged ones .",
    "this statement was verified for @xmath11 ( the fraction of the virtual photon energy transferred to the detected hadron ) in the current fragmentation region , for cases of different scaling functions , for all nuclear targets and any value of the bjorken scaling variable @xmath10 . in all cases ,",
    "the main mechanism was the direct production of pseudoscalar mesons . including in consideration the additional mechanism of pseudoscalar mesons production in result of decay of resonances , leaded to the decrease of average formation lengths .",
    "it was shown that the average formation lengths of positively ( negatively ) charged mesons were slowly rising ( decreasing ) functions of @xmath10 .",
    "+ the investigation of average formation lengths of baryons and antibaryons is the next step in the study of space - time structure of hadronization process .",
    "the mechanism for meson production follows rather naturally from the simple picture of a meson as a short piece of string between @xmath12 and @xmath13 endpoints .",
    "there is no unique recipe to generalize this picture to baryons . in the framework of lund model  @xcite the baryon in dis",
    "can be produced in three scenarios : ( i ) diquark scenario ; ( ii ) simple popcorn scenario ; ( iii ) advanced popcorn scenario .",
    "( i ) diquark picture .",
    "baryon production may , in its simplest form , be obtained by assuming that any flavor @xmath14 , produced from color field of string , could represent either a quark or an antidiquark in a color triplet state .",
    "then the same basic formalism can be used as in case of meson production , supplemented with the probability to produce various diquark pairs . in this simple picture the baryon and the antibaryon",
    "are produced as neighbours in rank in a string breakup .",
    "+ the experimental data indicate that occasionally one or a few mesons may be produced in between the baryon and the antibaryon ( @xmath15 ) along the string .",
    "this fact was used for development the so called popcorn model .",
    "the popcorn model is a more general framework for baryon production , in which diquarks as such are never produced , but rather baryons appear from the successive production of several @xmath16 pairs .",
    "it is evidently the density and the size of the color fluctuations which determine the properties of the @xmath15 production process .",
    "the density determines the rate of baryon production but in case the fluctuations are large on the scale of the meson masses it is possible that one or more mesons are produced between the @xmath15-pair . taking into account the uncertainty principle",
    "we can estimate the value of the color fluctuations .",
    "it turn out that there is a fast fall - off with the size of the space - time regions inside which color fluctuations may occur .",
    "therefore , in a model of this kind , @xmath15 produced in pair are basically either nearest neighbours or next nearest neighbours in rank .",
    "( ii ) simple popcorn . in this model",
    "it is assumed that at most one meson could be produced between the baryon and antibaryon .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath15 and @xmath17 ( with additional meson between @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) configurations occur with equal probability .",
    "( iii ) advanced popcorn .",
    "it is assumed that several mesons could be produced between the baryon and antibaryon .",
    "this model has more complicated set of parameters . in this work , for the sake of simplicity",
    ", the diquark picture will be used .",
    "+ in section 2 the theoretical framework is briefly presented . in section 3",
    "the obtained results are presented and discussed .",
    "the section 4 contains conclusions .",
    "in refs .  @xcite it was shown that a ratio of multiplicities for the nucleus and deuterium can be presented in the form of a function of single variable which has the physical meaning of the formation length ( time ) of the hadron .",
    "this scaling was verified , for the case of charged pions , by hermes experiment  @xcite .",
    "now hermes experiment prepares two - dimensional analysis of nuclear attenuation data .",
    "+ in the string model , for the construction of fragmentation functions , the scaling function @xmath20 is introduced ( see , for instance , refs .",
    "it is defined by the condition that @xmath21 is the probability that the first hierarchy ( rank 1 ) primary hadron carries away the fraction of energy @xmath11 of the initial string .",
    "we use symmetric lund scaling function  @xcite for calculations : @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are parameters of model , @xmath25 is the transverse mass of final hadron , @xmath26 is normalization factor . + in the further study we will use the average value of the formation length defined as @xmath27 . + the consideration is convenient to begin from @xmath28 direct , @xmath29 , which takes into account the direct production of hadrons : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the full hadronization length , @xmath32 is the string tension ( string constant ) , @xmath33 is the distribution of the constituent formation length @xmath34 of hadrons carrying fractional energy @xmath11 . @xmath35 @xmath36 the functions @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the probabilities that in electroproduction process on proton target the valence quark compositions for leading ( rank 1 ) and subleading ( rank 2 ) hadrons will be obtained .",
    "similar functions were obtained in  @xcite for more general case of nuclear targets . in eq.(3 ) @xmath39- and @xmath40-functions arise as a consequence of energy conservation law .",
    "the functions @xmath41 are distributions of the constituent formation length @xmath34 of the rank @xmath42 hadrons carrying fractional energy @xmath11 . for calculation of distribution functions we used recursion equation from ref .",
    "+ the simple form of @xmath20 for standard lund model allows to sum the sequence of produced hadrons over all ranks ( @xmath43 ) . the analytic expression for the distribution function in this case",
    "was presented in  @xcite .",
    "+ unfortunately , in case of more complicated scaling function presented in eq.(1 ) the analytic summation of the sequence of produced hadrons over all ranks is impossible .",
    "therefore , we limited ourself by @xmath44 in eq.(3 ) .",
    "+ in the ref .",
    "@xcite the essential contributions in the spectra of pseudoscalar mesons from the decays of vector mesons were obtained .",
    "now , using the same formalism we will calculate the contribution of baryonic resonances in the average formation lengths of baryons .",
    "+ the distribution function of the constituent formation length @xmath34 of the daughter hadron @xmath45 which arises in result of decay of parent resonance @xmath46 and carries away the fractional energy @xmath11 is denoted @xmath47 .",
    "it can be computed from the convolution integral : @xmath48 @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 , @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) is maximal ( minimal ) fraction of the energy of parent resonance , which can be carried away by the daughter baryon . + let us consider the two - body isotropic decay of resonance @xmath46 , @xmath54 , and denote the energy and momentum of the daughter hadron @xmath45 ( @xmath55 or @xmath56 ) , in the rest system of resonance , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively . in the coordinate system where resonance has energy and momentum equal @xmath59 and @xmath60 , @xmath61 @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the mass of resonance @xmath46 . in the laboratory ( fixed target ) system the resonance usually fastly moves , i.e. @xmath64 .",

    "we can write the expression for the average value of the formation length @xmath69 for the daughter baryon @xmath45 produced in result of decay of the parent resonance @xmath46 in form : @xmath70 + here it is need to give some explanations",
    ". we can formally consider @xmath69 as the formation length of daughter baryon @xmath45 for two reasons : ( i ) the parent resonance and daughter hadron are the hadrons of the same rank , which have common constituent quark ; ( ii ) beginning from this distance the chain consisting from prehadron , resonance and final baryon @xmath45 interacts ( in nuclear medium ) with hadronic cross sections .",
    "+ the general formula for @xmath28 for the case when a few resonances contribute can be written in form : @xmath71 @xmath72 where @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) is the probability that @xmath75 system turns into baryon ( baryonic resonance ) . for @xmath4 and @xmath8 resonances , taking into account the decuplet / octet suppression and the extra @xmath76 suppression following from the mass differences  @xcite ,",
    "the condition @xmath74=@xmath73=0.5 is used .",

    "another information , which is not so obvious as in the previous case , is that antiproton has minimal average formation length on proton target ( may be it is connected with large denominator in function @xmath157 ) . in fig.5",
