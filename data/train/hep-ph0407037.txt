    "the light scalar mesons have been under intense debate during the past few years . the fact that these states have the same quantum numbers as the vacuum renders the understanding of their properties a primary concern since it can shed some light on the non - trivial structure of the vacuum in qcd and ultimately on the understanding of the mechanism for confinement in this theory .",
    "the existence of the @xmath5 and the @xmath6 was firmly established since the early 70 s due to their relatively narrow width . both couple strongly to @xmath7 and lie so close to the @xmath7 threshold at 987 mev , that their shapes are distorted by threshold effects in such a way that a naive interpretation in terms of constituents must be taken with great care .",
    "the correct interpretation of the @xmath8 and @xmath9 requires a coupled channel scattering analysis , being @xmath10 and @xmath7 for the @xmath8 , and @xmath11 and @xmath7 for the @xmath12 the relevant channels .",
    "wealth of work has been done trying to understand this phenomena and even a strong isospin violation has been suggested due to the strong coupling of these states to the @xmath7  channel @xcite .",
    "in addition to these states there are signals for other light scalar mesons . in spite of the fact that a light isoscalar scalar , the so - called sigma meson , was predicted by unitarized models @xcite , and effective models @xcite , it reentered the pdg classification of particles as the @xmath13 @xcite only after its prediction by the unitarization of the results of chiral perturbation theory as a state that do not survive in the large @xmath14 limit @xcite . after an intense activity on the experimental side over the past few years",
    ", compelling evidence has been accumulated for the existence of this state and its mass has been measured @xcite .",
    "nowadays we can safely say that we have a universal acceptance for the existence of enhancements at low energy in the s - wave isoscalar meson - meson scattering but the interpretation of this phenomena is still controversial . concerning the isoscalar channel a resonance with a mass around @xmath15 mev has been predicted by unitarized quark models @xcite , effective models @xcite , and unitarized chiral perturbation theory calculations @xcite .",
    "the @xmath16 s - wave data has been reanalyzed finding a relatively strong attraction in the @xmath17 channel  @xcite .",
    "this enhancement in the isoscalar channel of @xmath16  scattering is identified with an s - matrix pole at approximately 900 mev ( @xmath18(900 ) ) .",
    "recently , further evidence was reported for this resonance @xcite . in spite of this ,",
    "its existence is not generally accepted @xcite .    as a result of different analysis",
    "a general consensus is emerging on the existence of a light scalar nonet composed of the @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 and @xmath6 states @xcite .",
    "in particular , a recent analysis of three different independent aspects of the problem : the movement of the poles from the physical to the @xmath22 limit , the couplings to two pseudoscalar physical mesons and couplings to @xmath22 eigenstates , concludes that the lowest lying scalar nonet is composed of these states @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of this nonet contradicts the naive quark models expectations which requires @xmath23 states to be heavier than the @xmath24 states .",
    "some members of the light scalar nonet have a mass smaller than the corresponding members of the vector nonet .",
    "on the other hand , the nearly degeneracy of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 suggest an @xmath25 like quark composition but this is incompatible with the strong coupling of the @xmath5 to @xmath26 system . without exhausting the list of problems in the scalar sector we recall that the quark structure as probed by the electromagnetic interaction is definitively not consistent with a be naive @xmath1 composition @xcite .",
    "the latter problem was evident shortly after the discovery of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 mesons and alternative models for its internal structure were proposed .",
    "a @xmath27 structure was suggested by jaffe @xcite and a molecular  ( clustered four - quark ) composition was put forth in @xcite .",
    "the former proposal has gained renewed interest due to a striking prediction of this model which is consistent with the spectrum of the light scalar nonet : an _ inverted mass spectrum _ for four - quark states , when compared with a @xmath28 nonet , due to the presence of a hidden @xmath29 pair in some of the @xmath27 states @xcite .",
    "the quark content for the isotriplet and one of the isosinglets is @xmath30 and @xmath31 , being these the heavier states .",
    "the remaining isosinglet has a @xmath32 structure without strange quarks therefore being the lighter one .",
    "the isospinors contain a strange quark and should lie in between .",
    "since the mass of a hadron should increase roughly linearly with the number of constituent quarks , four - quark states are naively expected around @xmath33gev . in jaffe",
    "s picture , a magnetic gluon exchange interaction accounts for the lowering of this scale down to around @xmath34mev in such a way that the lowest lying scalar nonet can be in principle identified as four - quark states . in this model ,",
    "the nearly degeneracy of  the @xmath5 and @xmath6 and their strong coupling to @xmath7 is just a consequence of the flavor structure .",
    "the couplings to @xmath28 mesons follow from the flavor structure . in general , this formalism accounts for the spectrum of the lowest lying scalar mesons",
    ". a crucial test of the quark structure of the scalar mesons would be the systematic study of their couplings , specially the calculation of two photon decays of neutral scalars which to the best of our knowledge is still lacking .",
    "the calculation of electromagnetic transitions such as @xmath35 are also necessary to understand the recently presented data by the experimental groups at @xmath36 factories @xcite from this perspective .",
    "finally , four - quark states are expected to mix with conventional @xmath1 states to yield physical mesons and this mixing should be accounted for in this formalism .",
    "a different explanation to the light scalar spectrum was proposed in @xcite based on phenomenological lagrangians for qcd formulated firstly in @xcite . in this formalism",
    ", the _ inverted mass spectrum _ of the lightest scalar nonet arises from an interplay between the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry ( sb@xmath37s ) and a trilinear interaction between fields .",
    "this interaction is a remnant at the hadron level of the six - quark interaction due to instantons in qcd @xcite and is trilinear for @xmath1 states only , hence scalars are interpreted as @xmath1 in this framework . under sb@xmath37s , two of the quarks entering in the six - quark t hooft interaction acquires non - vanishing v.e.v . generating flavour - dependent mass terms which mix the fields and drastically modify the mass spectrum for scalars as compared with naive quark model expectations .",
    "this mechanism yields also an inverted mass spectrum and describes this phenomena and the distorting of the pseudoscalar spectrum in a unified way @xcite . in this formalism couplings between scalar and scalar mesons",
    "are dictated by chiral symmetry and can be related to meson masses .",
    "the small two photon decay width of scalars is also satisfactorily described in this framework @xcite .",
    "indeed , these decays are induced by loops of charged meson in this framework , the final photon being emitted by the charged mesons in the loop .",
    "interestingly , the main contribution to both @xmath5 and @xmath6 decays into two photons comes from loops of charged kaons . in the former case",
    ", a dominant contribution is naively expected to come from charged pion loops since this meson predominantly decay into pions and the latter are lighter than kaons . however , @xmath5 coupling to pions is small and it is only because the @xmath26 channel has vanishing phase space that this meson decay mainly into two pions .",
    "the two photon decay of the @xmath5 , tests the _ _",
    "couplings  _ _ and phase space plays no role .",
    "therefore this decay provides further evidence for the strong coupling of the @xmath5 to a pair of kaons and ultimately for its internal bare structure as predominantly @xmath38 with some dressing of @xmath26 due to quantum fluctuations .",
    "a similar effect is seen in the rare @xmath39 decay but in this case  for the sigma meson which was expected to dominate the low energy region of the @xmath40  invariant mass .",
    "this region was accurately measured by the kloe coll .",
    "@xcite finding no bump  associated to the sigma",
    ". instead , this coll . finds a strange pattern which is attributed to a @xmath41 interference . in our view",
    ", this is another beautiful manifestation of the mechanism behind the inverted mass spectrum of the light scalar mesons . indeed , in order to the sigma manifest in the dipion invariant mass spectrum it is necessary that this meson couple not only to the _ final _ state but also to the _ production _ mechanism .",
    "since the involved particles have no electric charge , in addition to mechanisms involving vector mesons which are under control , this decay proceeds through the chain @xmath42 with the first decay proceeding via loops of charged mesons .",
    "the decaying @xmath36 is an @xmath38 state and does not couple to pions , thus the leading contributions come from kaon loops .",
    "the @xmath8 strongly couple to kaons and although weakly to pions it is sufficient to show up in the dipion mass spectrum . as for the sigma meson , it would dominate the dipion spectrum at low energies if its coupling to kaons were large enough .",
    "however , in the model this coupling goes as @xmath43 with @xmath44 a typical hadronic scale , thus being small for a light sigma with a mass around the kaon mass .",
    "the sigma contribution in the low energy dipion mass region turns out to be of the order of the @xmath8 contribution yielding the observed interference @xcite . both , the interference pattern in @xmath45  decay and the two photon decay of the  @xmath5 are sensitive to the scalar mixing angle .",
    "the proper description of these processes is consistent with a mixing angle @xmath46 .",
    "this angle is consistent with the spectrum of the light scalars in the model @xcite , and a similar value is obtained in the independent analysis of the properties of light scalar mesons presented in @xcite . in summary , _ the fundamental reason why the sigma does not show up clearly in the dipion mass spectrum is that it does not couple to the production mechanism , a fact related to the mechanism for the inverse mass spectrum ! _    some other @xmath36 radiative decays have been studied in this framework @xcite yielding results which accommodate the experimental data from high luminosity @xmath36 factories , thus rendering a simple framework where the measured properties of scalar are satisfactorily explained .",
    "it must be mentioned however that the model is still too crude and there are some aspects which do not work that well . in particular , the @xmath47 mixing angle as estimated using the pseudoscalar spectrum as input is too small : @xmath48 in the singlet - octet basis or @xmath49 in the strange - nonstrange basis @xcite .",
    "an estimation of this angle from the two gamma decays of @xmath50 and @xmath51 using the strong contribution to the singlet anomalies as predicted by the model , the electromagnetic contributions to such anomalies as calculated in qcd , and the anomaly matching arguments by t hooft yield @xmath52 ( @xmath53 in the singlet - octet basis ) @xcite .",
    "the three flavor linear sigma model was also used in @xcite as a toy model  to study properties of light mesons .",
    "a convenient unitarization procedure was proven to give encouraging results for meson - meson scattering .",
    "in addition , the possible quark composition of the light scalar ( and pseudoscalar ) fields was discussed on the light of the chiral transformation properties of the corresponding quark structures .",
    "the conclusion is that non - standard structures such as @xmath54 have the same transformation properties under chiral rotations as the conventional @xmath1 structures and they can not be distinguished by chiral effective lagrangians .",
    "indeed , the conventional mapping between meson fields and quark structures considers the matrix @xmath55 where @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) is a flavor ( color ) index , and @xmath58 , @xmath59 stand for the left- and right - handed quark projections respectively , as realizing a @xmath60 composite color - singlet meson field .",
    "the transformation properties of meson fields under chiral rotations on @xmath61 and @xmath62 are induced from this mapping .",
    "however , there exists some other possible structures such as the molecule  field @xmath63 or the four - quark composition in a @xmath64diquark - anti - diquark ( @xmath65 ) configuration , namely@xmath66 with the diquark fields @xmath67 in a flavor - triplet and color - triplet state given by @xmath68 where @xmath69 denotes the charge conjugation matrix .",
    "in addition , it is also possible to have more complicated structures such as the diquark- diquark composite with the diquarks in a flavor - triplet , color - sextet configuration . under chiral @xmath70 transformations these fields transform as @xmath71 where @xmath72 denotes @xmath73 @xmath74 or @xmath75 and @xmath76 and @xmath77 are independent unitary , unimodular matrices associated with the transformations on @xmath61 and @xmath78 these meson fields have also identical transformation properties under parity and charge conjugation : @xmath79 however ,",
    "under @xmath80 transformations @xmath81 , @xmath82 quark - antiquark and four - quark structures transform differently @xmath83    since the chiral @xmath70 transformation properties of all these fields are identical , in @xcite the conclusion is reached that we can not assign a specific quark structure to the fields used in the construction of phenomenological chiral lagrangians realizing this symmetry , which on the other side are the appropriate tools for the long distance description of the physics of mesons composed by light quarks , whatever this composition be",
    ". however , the full chiral symmetry at the level of massless qcd is actually @xmath84 and the violation of @xmath80 by non - perturbative effects can distinguish at least a @xmath1 state from a four - quark state in any of its internal configurations .",
    "this is clear if we consider the effects of instantons which at the quark level  generate an effective six - quark interaction manifesting in a three - meson determinantal interaction at the hadron level which is claimed in @xcite to be responsible for the inverse scalar spectrum .",
    "the existence of two scalar nonets , one below @xmath85gev and another one around @xmath86gev , lead to the exploration of two nonet models .",
    "a first step in this direction was given in @xcite where a light four - quark scalar nonet and a heavy @xmath1 -like nonet are mixed up to yield physical scalar mesons above and below @xmath87 gev .",
    "in the same spirit , in ref .",
    "@xcite a linear sigma model is coupled to a nonet field with well defined transformation properties under chiral rotations and trivial dynamics , except for a @xmath2 ( non - determinantal ) violating interaction .",
    "the possibility for the pseudoscalar light mesons to have a small four - quark content was speculated on the light of this toy  model .",
    "an alternative approach was formulated in @xcite where two linear sigma models were coupled using the very same interaction as in @xcite .",
    "the novelty here is a higss mechanism at the hadron level in such a way that the members of a pseudoscalar nonet are eaten up  by axial vector mesons and one ends up with only one nonet of pseudoscalars and two nonets of scalars .",
    "the model is used as a specific realization of the conjectured energy - dependent  composition of scalar mesons based on a detailed analysis of the whole experimental situation @xcite .    beyond the lowest lying @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 and @xmath6 states ,",
    "the next group of scalars listed by particle data group are all in the energy region around @xmath86gev : @xmath88 @xmath89 @xmath90 and @xmath91 @xcite .",
    "in addition , we have the @xmath92 at a slightly higher mass @xcite .",
    "the main point of this paper is to note that if we consider the scalar states around @xmath86gev as the members of a nonet , then it presents a slightly inverted mass spectrum : the heavier states are the cuasi - degenerate isotriplet and isosinglet states @xmath90 and @xmath91 , the lightest one is the isosinglet @xmath93 and the isovector @xmath94 is in between .",
    "this structure is characteristic of a four - quark nonet .",
    "furthermore , a look onto the pseudoscalar side at the same energy yields the following states : @xmath95 @xmath96 @xmath97 @xcite . thus _ data seems to indicate the existence of a cuasi - degenerate chiral nonet around _",
    "@xmath98 _ _  gev _ _ _ whose scalar component has a slightly inverted mass spectrum_. on the other hand , the linear rising of the mass of a hadron with the number of constituent quarks indicates that four - quark states should lie slightly below @xmath99 gev .",
    "this lead us to conjecture that this chiral nonet comes from tetraquark states mixed with conventional @xmath1 mesons to form physical mesons .",
    "the cuasi - degeneracy of this chiral nonet indicates that chiral symmetry is realized in a direct way for tetraquark states .",
    "in this work we report results on the implementation of this idea in the framework of an effective chiral lagrangian .",
    "we start with two chiral nonets , one around @xmath100 gev with chiral symmetry realized directly , and another one at low energy with chiral symmetry spontaneously broken .",
    "in contrast to previous studies , mesons in the heavy  nonet are considered as four - quark states .",
    "the nature of these states is distinguished from conventional @xmath1 mesons by terms breaking the @xmath2 symmetry .",
    "we introduce also mass terms appropriate to four - quark states which yield an inverted spectrum for the pure  four - quark structured fields .",
    "these states mix with conventional @xmath1 states .",
    "we fix the parameters of the model using as input the masses for @xmath101 , @xmath6 , @xmath102 @xmath103 @xmath104 @xmath105 in addition to the weak decay constants @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "the model gives definite predictions for the masses of the remaining members of the nonets .",
    "couplings of all mesons entering the model are also predicted .",
    "the outcome of the fit allow us to identify the remaining mesons as the @xmath108 @xmath97 on the pseudoscalar side and @xmath88 @xmath109 @xmath90 @xmath91 on the scalar side .",
    "in general , isospinor and isovector pseudoscalar mesons arise as weak mixing of @xmath1 and tetraquark fields .",
    "in contrast , scalars in these isotopic sectors are strongly mixed . concerning the isoscalar sector we obtain a strong mixing between @xmath1 and tetraquarks for both scalar and pseudoscalar fields .",
    "we remark that results for isosinglet scalars are expected to get modified by the mixing of pure @xmath1 and four - quark- structured mesons with the lowest lying scalar glueball field .",
