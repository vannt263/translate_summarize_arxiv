    "like other third generation light sources bessy ii exceeds many of the primary design goals . users not only appreciate the additional potential of the excellent beam definition and stability  an increasing number of experiments simply depend on the high and reliable beam quality .",
    "especially important are minimal beam center of mass drifts , well defined beam energy with minimal spread and high beam intensity with a long lifetime .",
    "it is difficult to prevent drifting of these parameters over the several days necessary for an experiment .",
    "many effects originating from facility operating conditions and user activities can contribute .",
    "since there is never enough time to isolate all possible effects by dedicated accelerator development studies archives of logged data are most important sources of information .",
    "despite the eminent importance of archived data the archiving system at bessy is far from being well settled .",
    "adequate carefully done is the collection both of snapshot files and long term monitoring data @xcite .",
    "loss or omission of essential data would destroy unrecoverable knowledge about past behaviour of the facility .",
    "retrieval tools are still cumbersome , immature and subject of maloperation frequently resulting in loss of work time .",
    "configuration is mainly hand - work , thus not fault free .",
    "surveillance of data source availability and data integrity is done occasionally . only the collector programs themselves",
    "are systematically supervised by watch - dog or stop / restart procedures .",
    "initially the bessy archiving configuration was based on the sdds toolkit .",
    "storage format are compressed sdds files spanning a device class and a full day , sorted into a calendar mapping directory structure .",
    "a tcltk glue application combines navigation , sdds data retrieval , correlation and export  @xcite .",
    "this data store is still a good compromise even though not optimal with respect to data format and size , network resources and cpu requirements : channel selection , previewing facility , available post - processing tools cover most of operators requirements .",
    "the sdds archive is not discontinued , collects 20 gb / y and serves as valuable backup system .",
    "a more or less frozen and easy maintainable list of signals essential for the understanding of basic operation parameters are monitored .",
    "major obstacle for a site - wide usage of the archive is the ( intended ) in - accessibility of the data store residing in the protected accelerator control production area .      since mid 2000 a _ channel archiver _",
    "@xcite instance has been set up in addition .",
    "it is intended to overcome the self - containment of the ( accelerator ) sdds archiver and serve the whole site .",
    "any major development and configuration effort goes into this system .",
    "data collector engine(s ) and cgiexport retrieval tools are installed in a dedicated environment@xcite . a six processor hp n - class server ( _ archive server _ ) in a non - routable private network stores the data on a raid system that is backed up to a tape robot .",
    "it is planned to migrate mass storage to a fibre channel system attached to a tape library this year .      in an attempt to minimize adverse effects on the system caused by unexpected activities and to maximize uptime",
    "neither user accounts nor nfs access to the archiver network are provided . for data collection",
    "all data sources residing on dedicated networks are connected by two multi - homed ca - gateway computers ( 8 network interfaces each ) . presently a single archiving engine ( process ) stores 50 gb / y accelerator relevant data .",
    "a second engine has been set up early this year for the beamline area and auxiliary data presently collecting about 15gb / y .",
    "common retrieval method is http invocation of cgiexport @xcite via the central network router .",
    "typically the available gnuplot presentation of the data requested is used as a preview ensuring that the data selection provides the desired information .",
    "then the data are retrieved in spread - sheet or matlab format and stored on local disk .",
    "favourite postprocessing tools are pc windows tools ( origin , excel ) or unix applications ( idl , matlab ) .",
    "a small program ( caa2sdds ) converts the spread - sheet output to sdds format enabling data analysis with the full data selection , post - processing and display power of sdds .",
    "probably tracking down sudden perturbations to its causes is the most common usage of the archive .",
    "examples for this application are e.g.  an unusual large drift that corresponded to the failure of a water pump or the sudden onset of orbit jumps that was due to an improper motor reset resulting in a constant rotation of strong chicane magnets .",
    "archived data help to get a first idea of possible explanations : mid 2001 for example a strong , periodic orbit perturbation has been reported by the operators . by phase analysis it was possible to locate the problem source with a few meters precision at a ring segment where no active elements are installed .",
    "the time pattern of perturbation onset and disappearance ( see fig .  [ user ] ) suggested an unknown correlation with user activities .",
    "targeted investigation found out that one user group reversed the field of a 1 [ t ] magnet twice a minute several meters apart from the beampipe .              on the long term",
    "extreme the archive provides the data needed to make evolutions visible that are hardly perceptible on a fill to fill basis .",
    "plotting e.g. the normalized lifetime [ mah ] against the accumulated dose [ ah ] over the full operating time of the facility is a powerful mean to find out very fundamental factors : from fig .",
    "[ dose ] it can be concluded , that the vacuum related lifetime reduction is basically overcome by beam scrubbing 1000 [ ah ] after start up of the accelerator .",
    "every venting due to installation requirements needs another 100 [ ah ] to reinstall the previous performance . on top of these basic conditions global lifetime improving effects of landau cavities ( mid 2000 )",
    "as well as reducing effects of imperfectly corrected insertion devices ( beginning 2001 ) can be seen .",
    "requirements on uptime , reliability and consistency of the archive are substantial .",
    "the archive data have to contain signals of very different importance .",
    "beam intensity e.g.  is analyzed and correlated in any thinkable way : integration ( dose ) , differentiation ( beam loss ) , pattern analysis ( user runs ) etc . here",
    "a loss of data would be serious , but recognized within minutes .",
    "other signals are monitored as a precaution .",
    "they could potentially help to find candidates for sources of performance degradation .",
    "dispensable for the all day business they are not under human surveillance .",

    "retrieving a dozen of channels out of the ` middle ' of a continuous archive holding several thousands of channels requires patience .    as a first improvement approach the huge monolithic data block is split into a moderate number of weekly ordered chunks holding certain fragments of the whole signal collection .",
    "adjustment of the i / o routines results in orders of magnitude retrieval acceleration .",
    "but however home grown data formats are optimized : ultimately the retrieval of arbitrary data selections out of huge data stores is best done with commercial rdb systems .",
    "consequently the utilization of a rdb storage format has to be re - considered .",
    "ideally one would like to be able to ` replay ' any controllable and measurable parameter out of the signal archive with the reasonable time resolution of a few seconds . for a bessy size facility",
    "this would require data stores of several tb / y .",
    "the _ channel archiver _ provides a robust data collector and retrieval toolkit but the archive itself has to be reduced to manageable dimensions .",
    "the challenges today are configuration ( select relevant signals , grouping , choose proper archiving frequencies ) , correlation detection ( identify signals ) and data organisation ( optimized search ) .",

    "<S> data post - processing tools cover windows applications , idl , sdds and custom programs matching users skills and preferences . in this paper illustrative sample data explorations are described that underline the importance of the logging system for operations as well as for the understanding of singular events or long term drifts . </S>",
    "<S> serious shortcomings of the present installation and focus of further development are described . </S>"
