    "the main goal of ultra - relativistic heavy ion physics is to test the properties of matter , produced in nucleus - nucleus collisions at the highest energy densities accessible in the laboratory , and to develop an understanding of these properties from first principles of the fundamental theory of strong interactions , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . to this end",
    ", particle production in heavy ion collisions and its dependence on the formation of a dense system can be studied experimentally as a function of a large number of variables .",
    "these variables include the kinematic ones ( such as centre - of - mass energy , transverse momentum and rapidity ) , as well as variables specific to heavy ion collisions , which typically control the size and shape of the collision region ( such as the impact parameter or the nuclear number @xmath0 of the colliding nuclei ) .    over the last two decades",
    ", relativistic heavy ion collisions have been studied experimentally at increasingly higher centre - of - mass energies at the brookhaven alternating gradient synchrotron ags ( @xmath1 gev ) , the cern super proton synchrotron sps ( @xmath2 gev ) and the brookhaven relativistic heavy ion collider rhic ( @xmath3 gev ) . as discussed in this article",
    ", the data collected in these experimental campaigns display remarkable generic trends as a function of system size and kinematic variables .",
    "the large hadron collider lhc at cern will study heavy ion collisions at a centre - of - mass energy @xmath4 tev , which is almost a factor 30 higher than the maximal collision energy at rhic .",
    "there has been a lot of work in recent years on benchmarking model calculations of heavy ion collisions to rhic data and extrapolating them to the higher lhc energies .",
    "the present topical review does not aim at such a comprehensive summary .",
    "rather , the aim of this review is to identify the generic trends in the existing data and to discuss the consequences for our understanding of heavy ion collisions if these trends should persist or should fail to persist at the lhc . for those classes of measurements , where guidance from existing data is scarce ( for instance for measurements at high-@xmath5 or forward rapidity , where lhc is unique )",
    ", we shall focus on generic features in the current model calculations , and discuss how they are expected to manifest themselves at the lhc .",
    "we believe that the identification of generic trends in the data and their agnostic extrapolation to lhc energies may help to sharpen our view on what is expected at lhc energies and what constitutes a surprise .",
    "in addition , many of the generic trends listed in this article did not yet find a fully satisfactory explanation .",
    "if they persist at the lhc , this would indicate that they should not be discarded as mere numerical coincidences , but should find an explanation in a future , more complete theory .",
    "in @xmath6 , where the partons produced initially carry perturbatively high virtuality , main characteristics of the longitudinal and transverse multiplicity distributions can be understood quantitatively from the dynamics of the perturbative parton shower ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , despite uncertainties in the modelling of hadronization . in contrast , in hadronic collisions , event multiplicities and multiplicity distributions are dominated by processes involving non - perturbatively small momentum transfers ; there are many models but an understanding of multiplicity distributions based on first principles is missing . even in proton - proton collisions , the extrapolation of the charged particle multiplicity per unit rapidity @xmath7 from the tevatron ( @xmath8 tev ) to the lhc ( @xmath9 tev ) leads to results which vary by a factor 2 for models successful up to tevatron energies  @xcite . for nucleus - nucleus collisions ,",
    "the uncertainties in the predictions of minimum bias event multiplicities are of comparable magnitude .",
    "for instance , prior to the start - up of rhic , model extrapolations of @xmath10 from the sps centre - of - mass energy for pb - pb collisions ( @xmath11 gev ) to au - au collisions at rhic ( @xmath12 gev ) varied by a factor 2 approximately  @xcite .",
    "rhic data lie at the lower end of the predicted range .",
    "this in turn has narrowed the range of predictions for the lhc .",

    "+ pseudorapidity distributions is for many purposes a good approximation of rapidity @xmath14 . however , since multiplicity distributions are dominated by particles at small transverse momentum , there are visible differences : @xmath15 is of trapezoidal shape ( see figure  [ fig1 ] ) , while @xmath16 is of gaussian shape .",
    "so , figure  [ fig1 ] does _ not _ imply a rapidity plateau . for @xmath0-@xmath0 collisions , multiplying @xmath17 at @xmath18 by the conversion factor",

    "2 .    + for all processes at a given centre - of - mass energy ,",
    "the pseudorapidity distribution is the same basic distribution adjusted for the number of participants in the two colliding systems .",

    "= 10.cm    the apparent universality of these observations motivates an agnostic extrapolation to the lhc : if @xmath0-@xmath0 data at lhc follow the same limiting fragmentation curve and if the trapezoidal shape of pseudo - rapidity distributions persists , then one expects for @xmath23 at lhc the solid line in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "this curve implies @xmath24 .",
    "more generally , the persistence of extended longitudinal scaling in the high energy limit implies that at mid - rapidity , @xmath20 can grow at most logarithmically with @xmath25 , except if there is a novel mechanism due to which the curvature of @xmath20 changes its sign _ twice _ between @xmath21 and the fragmentation region .    essentially",
    "all models of multiplicity distributions predict a power - law increase with @xmath13 .",
    "this is a rather generic consequence of perturbative particle production mechanisms , which become more important with increasing @xmath25 .",
    "however , the power - law dependence of naive perturbative implementations is too strong to be reconciled with rhic data  this is arguably the main lesson learnt from the failure of many models at rhic .",
    "saturation models have received much attention recently , since they offer a fundamental reason for the very weak @xmath25-dependence of event multiplicities , namely the taming of the perturbative rise due to density - dependent non - linear parton evolution .",
    "still , saturation models assume that multiplicity distributions at ultra - relativistic energies are calculable within perturbation theory , since they are governed by a perturbatively high , @xmath25- and @xmath0-dependent momentum ( saturation ) scale @xmath26 .",
    "they predict essentially , that multiplicities at mid - rapidity rise @xmath27 times transverse area .",

    "are predicted .",
    "the pocket formula ( [ eq1 ] ) provides an explicit realization of the factorization property ( ii ) stated above , and accounts satisfactorily for the @xmath25- and @xmath0-dependences of charged multiplicity distributions from sps to maximal rhic energies  @xcite . for central pb - pb collisions at the lhc , equation  ( [ eq1 ] )",
    "leads to @xmath33 , which corresponds to the maximum of the dashed line in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "an alternative model implementation of saturation physics ideas arrives at @xmath34  @xcite . a similar value is also predicted by the ekrt final state saturation model  @xcite , which arrives at a @xmath35-dependence of the charged multiplicity at mid - rapidity .",
    "to arrive at a @xmath36-dependence in such schemes , one would have to invoke a mechanism , which amputates brutally the power - law tail in the spectrum for @xmath37 ( see e.g. the discussion of d. kharzeev in reference  @xcite ) .",
    "a complete list of model predictions is beyond the scope of this article .",
    "we emphasize , however , that none of these predictions can be reconciled with the assumption that the so - far universal extended longitudinal scaling persists at lhc energies .",
    "as seen from figure  [ fig1 ] , a distribution matching @xmath34 at mid - rapidity has to fall off significantly steeper than what is consistent with limiting fragmentation .",
    "also , the prediction @xmath33 , while being close to the maximum of what is consistent with limiting fragmentation , appears to deviate characteristically from the trapezoidal shape of all pseudo - rapidity distributions of charged multiplicity measured so far .    to summarize and generalize this discussion : either , the apparently universal `` structure '' seen in multiparticle production data at lower energies  @xcite is violated at the lhc . then , this violation is likely to provide highly discriminatory constraints on the dynamics underlying multiparticle production . or , the naive extrapolations of this structure to the lhc are confirmed .",
    "then , the central dynamical ideas advocated as explanations for the tamed growth of multiplicities up to rhic energies will have to be revisited .",
    "so , starting with the first day of operation , data from the lhc are likely to have profound consequences for our understanding of the matter produced in nucleus - nucleus collisions at the lhc _ and _ at rhic .",
    "the relative abundance of identified hadron species in heavy ion collisions follows a statistical ( `` thermal '' ) distribution pattern over a very broad energy range from sis / gsi ( @xmath38  gev ) up to rhic ( @xmath12  gev )  @xcite . for particle species ,",
    "for which global constraints ( such as total charge or flavour conservation ) are statistically unimportant because of sufficiently large event multiplicities , particle ratios are well described by the grand canonical ensemble of a hadron resonance gas .",
    "the only parameters of this model are the temperature @xmath39 at chemical decoupling , and the baryon chemical potential @xmath40 .",
    "fits to particle ratios reveal a characteristic @xmath13-dependence of these parameters , see figure  [ fig2 ] . the baryon chemical potential decreases by almost an order of magnitude from @xmath41  mev at the sps to @xmath42 - 40  mev at rhic and is generally assumed to be very small ( @xmath43  mev ) at lhc mid - rapidity .",
    "this reflects the expectation that due to the large difference between projectile and mid - rapidity at the lhc , the mid - rapidity region is almost net - baryon free .",
    "the chemical decoupling temperature approaches a @xmath13-independent limiting temperature @xmath44  mev , which seems to be almost reached at rhic and which is expected to persist at the lhc .",
    "these agnostic extrapolations to lhc energies have been used to predict the ratios of more than twenty hadron species , and there are computer codes implementing these model assumptions  .     and the baryochemical potential @xmath40 as a function of the centre - of - mass energy @xmath13 .",
    "data points up to rhic energies are taken from reference  @xcite .",
    "data points at @xmath45  tev are based on simple extrapolations of the observed tendency.,width=415 ]    early works on hadronic abundances used a strangeness saturation parameter  @xcite to account for enhanced strangeness production with increasing @xmath13 .",
    "this followed the idea that with increasing @xmath13 a gluon - rich initial system is formed , which is more efficient in producing strangeness .",
    "in contrast , the above - mentioned models do not fix the strangeness content with an additional parameter .",
    "these models explain strangeness increase by a _",
    "suppression _ of strange particles in low - multiplicity systems created at lower @xmath13 .",
    "this suppression is due to exact conservation laws , whose implementation leads to deviations from the grand - canonical limit  @xcite .",
    "the resulting canonical suppression factors are known analytically .    at rhic and at the lhc , canonical suppression is unimportant for strangeness , which is produced abundantly . on the other hand ,",
    "canonical suppression is important for open charm   and bottom production at the lhc . in this general sense , charm and bottom",
    "are likely to play at collider energies a similar role as strangeness played during the fixed - target era of heavy - ion physics .",
    "there is , however , one important difference : because of their large mass and small production cross section at thermal energies , the thermal production of charm and bottom quarks is disfavoured .",
    "thus , except for the very first proposals of thermal charm production  , models assume normally a production of heavy - flavoured quarks at perturbative rates , followed by a hadrochemical distribution of heavy - flavoured resonances according to the statistical model of hadroproduction  @xcite . in this approach , the centrality dependence of charm - flavoured particle ratios tests the transition from a canonical to a grand - canonical description .",
    "the models discussed so far implement the idea of statistical hadronization , but they do _ not _ specify the dynamics leading to the hadronic final state . in particular ,",
    "although the hadrochemical freeze - out temperature and baryochemical potential shown in figure  [ fig2 ] match within errors the qcd phase - space boundary determined in lattice qcd , the question whether this agreement implies the existence of dynamical thermalization processes lacks a more detailed support  @xcite .",
    "we conclude this section by listing three possibilities of how heavy - ion collisions at the lhc may help to elucidate the microscopic dynamics underlying hadronic abundances : first , it has been conjectured that charmonium production at the lhc is strongly enhanced above the perturbatively expected rates due to the recombination of @xmath46 and @xmath47 quarks originating in distinct hard partonic interactions  @xcite .",
    "establishing such a novel charmonium production mechanism could provide a strong indication that thermalization processes affect hadrochemical distributions .",
    "this is so , since transport of exogamous @xmath46- and @xmath47-partners is likely to be necessary to make their coalescence possible .",
    "second , we mention in passing a proposal that the abundances of strange hadrons could exceed significantly grand - canonical predictions . this is seen in models in which a _ sudden _ hadronization of an equilibrated plasma leads to strangeness over - saturation in the hadronic phase  .",
    "while arguably speculative , this example illustrates that the extrapolation of ( standard ) statistical model predictions to the lhc can serve as a powerful baseline on top of which novel dynamical effects may be established .",
    "third , the masses and widths of the resonances entering the statistical operator of a resonance gas model may receive significant medium - modifications .",
    "this may lead to deviations of some broad resonances ( such as @xmath48-mesons ) from the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "while not specific for the lhc , it is likely that any confirmation and extended systematics of such deviations will provide constraints on the in - medium dynamics of hadronic resonances near freeze - out .",
    "the transverse momentum dependence of identified single inclusive hadron spectra has been studied in heavy ion collisions from sis / gsi up to rhic energies . here , we follow the common practice of discussing these spectra as a function of their transverse mass @xmath49 , rather than their transverse momentum .",
    "the @xmath50-distributions are commonly characterized by a mono - exponential fit @xmath51 $ ]  @xcite , where the inverse - slope parameter @xmath52 characterizes the steepness of the distributions .",
    "the fit value @xmath52 can depend on the @xmath50-range over which the fit is performed , but despite the ensuing uncertainties , the following generic features can be stated :    1 .",
    "+ at given @xmath13 , the inverse - slope parameters of pions , kaons , and protons increase _ approximately linearly _ with the particle rest mass . in particular @xmath53 .",
    "the hadrons , which do not follow this systematics , such a the multistrange @xmath54 , the @xmath55 or the @xmath56 , show roughly the same value @xmath52 .",
    "a seemingly common denominator of these latter hadrons is their relatively small interaction cross sections with the expected constituents of the medium  @xcite .",
    "the spectra become flatter with increasing @xmath13 , so the inverse slope parameter @xmath52 increases .",
    "also , the mass - dependence of @xmath52 for pions , kaons and protons increases with @xmath13  .",
    "the inverse - slope parameter @xmath52 has been interpreted as a blue - shifted temperature , resulting from a combination of thermal emission from a source of temperature @xmath57 at freeze - out , and the collective motion with average transverse velocity @xmath58 of this particle emitting source .",
    "while @xmath57 and @xmath58 are difficult to disentangle on the basis of single inclusive spectra alone , two - particle correlations may be used to separate both contributions  @xcite .",
    "the increase of @xmath52 with particle rest mass [ point ( i ) ] is consistent with the interpretation of @xmath52 as a blue - shifted temperature  @xcite , if the particles decouple at the time of freeze - out . on the other hand , particles which decouple earlier due to their smaller cross sections",
    "would acquire less radial flow , and thus have a smaller @xmath52 . in this radial - flow picture , the growing difference between inverse - slope parameters as @xmath13 increases [ point ( ii ) ] is ascribed to the growth in the average transverse velocity @xmath58 .",
    "the above features emerge naturally in fluid - dynamics models without  @xcite or with  @xcite viscous corrections .",
    "we are not aware of full fluid - dynamic studies of these spectra at lhc energy . however , there are extrapolations of the fit parameters @xmath57 and @xmath58 , extracted from the approximately exponential @xmath50-spectra  @xcite . in these studies , the kinetic freeze - out temperature saturates at a value @xmath59  mev at sps energy , which may be expected to persist up to the lhc . the parameter @xmath58 is found to increase with @xmath13 ; it reaches @xmath60 at rhic , but it remains unclear whether this increase is smooth  @xcite .",
    "the statements made here are obtained within a blast - wave model  @xcite or within a fluid - dynamic picture supporting such a model .",
    "they generally indicate an increase of @xmath52 with @xmath13 . here , the real physical issue is to assess whether it is really a collective hydrodynamic mechanism , which determines the energy - dependence of @xmath52 . since the slope of spectra evolves significantly with @xmath13 also for more elementary proton - proton collisions , in which flow is either absent or at least different , it is not straightforward to disentangle flow effects from other mechanisms .",
    "this makes quantitative comparisons difficult and leads to a lack of precision in extrapolations to the lhc .",
    "we now turn to the azimuthal dependence of single inclusive transverse momentum spectra , where these difficulties appear to be less severe .",
    "in non - central collisions , the impact parameter selects a preferred direction in the transverse plane , breaking the rotational symmetry around the beam axis .",
    "consequently , observables can depend on azimuth , measured with respect to the reaction plane spanned by the impact parameter and the beam direction .",
    "the azimuthally - dependent effect most widely studied both experimentally , over the whole range of available collision energies , and theoretically , is the azimuthal anisotropy in particle production , often referred to as `` anisotropic ( transverse ) flow ''  @xcite .",
    "a non - vanishing anisotropic flow exists only if the particles measured in the final state depend not only on the physical conditions realized locally at their production point , but if particle production does also depend on the global event geometry . in a relativistic local theory ,",
    "this non - local information can only emerge as a collective effect , requiring interactions between many degrees of freedom , localized at different points in the collision region . in this general sense ,",
    "anisotropic flow is a particularly unambiguous and strong manifestation of collective dynamics in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "here , we discuss its features for hadrons at low-@xmath5 .",

    "the coefficients @xmath63 , where angular brackets denote an average over many particles and events , quantify the asymmetry .",
    "these coefficients are studied at all available energies as a function of transverse momentum , ( pseudo)rapidity , centrality of the collision and for various identified particle species .",

    "negative ) value of @xmath65 indicates an excess of particle production in ( resp .",
    "orthogonal to ) the reaction plane .",
    "the dependence of @xmath65 on centre - of - mass energy is known over three orders of magnitude , see figure  [ fig : flow2 ] .",
    "it can be understood qualitatively in terms of the following simple picture of a collective dynamics : at @xmath66  gev , the incoming nuclei transfer angular momentum to the nuclear matter in the overlap zone .",
    "the fast - rotating `` compound nucleus '' thus formed emits fragments , which lie preferentially in the reaction plane ( @xmath67 ) . as the centre - of - mass energy increases , the nuclear matter in the almond - shaped overlap region of the incoming nuclei",
    "is increasingly compressed in the collision .",
    "however , the parts of the nuclei that lie outside this overlap region ( `` spectators '' ) block the way for the compressed matter to expand within the reaction plane .",
    "squeeze - out _ the compressed matter orthogonal to the reaction plane ( @xmath68 ) . further increasing @xmath13 , the spectators are then fast enough to free the way , leaving behind at mid - rapidity an almond - shaped azimuthally asymmetric region of dense qcd matter .",
    "this spatial asymmetry implies unequal pressure gradients in the transverse plane , with a larger gradient in the reaction plane ( `` in - plane '' ) than perpendicular to it . as a consequence of the subsequent multiple interaction between many degrees of freedom",
    ", this spatial asymmetry leads to an anisotropy in momentum space : the final particle transverse momenta are more likely to be in - plane than `` out - of - plane '' , hence @xmath67 , as predicted in  @xcite .",
    "the momentum space asymmetries measured at collider energies are relatively large",
    ". since the prefactor of the cosine term in equation  ( [ eq2 ] ) is @xmath69 , a @xmath5-averaged value @xmath70 corresponds to a 20% variation of the average particle yield as a function of the angle with respect to the reaction plane . at high @xmath5 , where second harmonics at rhic approached values as large as @xmath71 , there are more than twice the number of particles emitted in the reaction plane than out - of - plane .",

    "this is of interest , since a @xmath13-independent slope of @xmath77 would imply e.g. that the increase of the @xmath5-integrated @xmath72 with @xmath13 arises solely from the increase of the average transverse momentum .",

    "third , mass - ordered @xmath77 at mid - rapidity are predicted in transport approaches  @xcite as well as in hydrodynamical models  @xcite , but details of the predicted mass hierarchy vary between models . for instance , two different ideal - fluid dynamics approaches predict scaling laws with different variables : the decoupling of all particle species from the same collective - flow field is argued in reference  @xcite to lead to a common @xmath89 for all hadrons ; while in the buda ",

    "quite generally , heavy quarks in equilibrium have a larger @xmath77 than non - equilibrated ones ; and the corresponding mesons have larger elliptic - flow values if they form through coalescence ( involving a light quark ) than if they come from heavy - quark fragmentation .",

    "the kinematically available @xmath5-range decreases with increasing rapidity , and data from rhic are currently limited to @xmath212  gev/@xmath46 for @xmath234 . within this limited range ,",

    "2 .    + at mid - rapidity , @xmath242 increases around the cronin peak for increasing centrality . in contrast , the centrality dependence at forward deuteron rapidity is inverted  @xcite : @xmath205 decreases with increasing centrality for @xmath243 , and the centrality dependence at @xmath238 is negligible .    in the context of rhic data ,",
    "the discussion of these phenomena has focused on two initial state effects , which we address now : multiple scattering and non - linear qcd evolution of the incoming parton distribution functions .",
    "the cronin peak is often thought of as the consequence of a multiple scattering picture , in which the partons in the deuteron wavefunction undergo multiple interactions in the target nucleus prior to producing relatively high-@xmath5 hadrons .",
    "incoherent multiple scattering of these incoming partons leads to a transverse momentum broadening of the initial parton distribution , which translates into a correspondingly broadened single inclusive hadron spectrum .",
    "this can account for the observed cronin peak at mid - rapidity  @xcite , though it is unclear whether it can account for the particle species dependence of the effect .",
    "moreover , at least in their current model implementations , such multiple scattering models predict the persistence of the cronin peak at forward rapidity , and they imply an increase of @xmath5-broadening with increasing centrality at all rapidities  @xcite .",
    "this contradicts the generic trends seen in the rhic data .    in studies of non - linear qcd evolution at small momentum fractions @xmath244 ,",
    "one generically finds that the growth of unintegrated gluon distribution functions with @xmath245 ( or with @xmath36 ) is saturated up to a scale @xmath246 , which grows with @xmath247 .",
    "moreover , above this saturation scale , non - linear qcd evolution characteristically changes the power - law in a wide geometric scaling window .",
    "contact between these findings and the phenomenology of d - au collisions is made by the following observations : first , toward deuteron projectile rapidity , smaller momentum fractions @xmath248 of the nuclear parton distribution functions become relevant for particle production .",
    "eventually , @xmath248 will become small enough for non - linear qcd evolution to be applicable .",
    "second , convoluting non - linear evolved unintegrated nuclear parton distributions schematically with hard processes , one finds that non - linear qcd evolution implies the decrease of @xmath231 with increasing @xmath249  @xcite .",

    "non - linear qcd evolution does not account for all trends seen in the data .",
    "in particular , the cronin peak itself is not a dynamical consequence of non - linear qcd evolution , it is just a conceivable initial condition , which is quickly washed out by the evolution .",
    "so , if saturation physics is the correct explanation for the rapidity dependence of @xmath205 , then one knows that it is not applicable at rhic mid - rapidity .",
    "also , while particle species identified data on @xmath205 are not accurate enough to allow for decisive tests , the question whether a purely partonic explanation is sufficient to account for @xmath205 in the experimentally tested range remained open so far .",
    "moreover , it is unclear on theoretical grounds whether saturation physics can be expected to apply for the relatively large values @xmath250",
    "@xcite which dominate forward particle production at rhic .",
    "experiments at the lhc will allow us to compare the @xmath13- and @xmath149-dependence . to illustrate that this may provide a decisive test for current models ,",
    "let us consider an alternative explanation of the rapidity dependence of @xmath205 at rhic , based on the following picture : partons in the deuteron wave function undergo _ inelastic _",
    "multiple scatterings on the nuclear target field .",
    "hence , these partons split due to interactions with the target .",
    "since splitting is very effective in energy degradation , this will deplete the hadron yield at forward rapidity but will enhance it at mid - rapidity .",
    "also , the opposite centrality dependence at mid - rapidity and forward rapidity [ point ( ii ) ] can be understood in this way . in this picture , the suppression in @xmath205 increases strongly with increasing projectile rapidity , because the energy degradation occurs on top of an increasingly steeply falling spectrum at forward rapidity .",
    "transverse momentum broadening could still contribute to the cronin peak at mid - rapidity , but would not be able to overcome the reduction at forward rapidity .",
    "this picture accounts for the same rapidity dependence as saturation models .",
    "in contrast to saturation models , however , it implies that the cronin peak will not disappear with increasing @xmath13 , but will persist at lhc energies .",
    "the example given above illustrates that comparing the @xmath13- and @xmath149-dependence at the lhc will provide a qualitatively novel test for the saturation physics interpretations of measurements at rhic .",
    "this is so , since an increase in both @xmath13 or @xmath149 gives access to smaller momentum fractions @xmath244 in the parton distributions , and thus has similar implications in saturation models . at the lhc ,",
    "the @xmath13-dependence of measurements , in combination with their @xmath149-dependence , will become a tool to discriminate effects from small-@xmath244 qcd evolution from other conceivable mechanisms .    focusing in the following solely on the nuclear modification factor , we now list phenomena which may affect significantly the @xmath149-dependence of @xmath183 at the lhc , and which may be disentangled by studying the @xmath13-dependence in a combination of data from rhic and lhc .",

    "+ the initial parton , produced in a hard collision , needs not be produced within longitudinal comoving matter . in case that it is not , there is a relative longitudinal velocity between the hard projectile and the medium , and energy loss is expected to be higher .",
    "this effect is likely to contributes to a _ decrease _ of @xmath183 with @xmath149  @xcite , though estimates of its magnitude vary widely  @xcite .",
    "+ as discussed above , the nuclear modification of parton distribution functions is expected to affect @xmath183 .",
    "in particular , models based on non - linear small-@xmath244 evolution predict  @xcite an additional _ decrease _ of @xmath183 with @xmath149 .",
    "these models can be tested by comparing the @xmath13- and @xmath149-dependences in @xmath134-pb collisions .",
    "the leading hadronic fragments of highly energetic parent partons , measured in single inclusive hadron spectra , are strongly modified at rhic and they are expected to be strongly modified at the lhc .",
    "any model of the dynamical mechanism underlying this medium modification has implications for the entire parton fragmentation pattern , and that is : jets and jet - like observables .",
    "jet measurements in heavy ion collisions are sensitive to how high - energy partons are attenuated in matter and how they equilibrate kinetically and chemically . in turn , these medium - modifications of jet fragmentation characterize properties of the produced medium .",
    "in general , parton fragmentation leads to multiplicity distributions with broad variances . as a consequence ,",
    "any particle trigger used to select jet - like observables will bias significantly the fragmentation pattern . even prior to invoking medium effects ,",
    "such biases have dramatic consequences : in a typical single inclusive hadron spectrum ( i.e. single particle trigger ) at @xmath253  gev/@xmath46 , the hadrons will typically carry on average @xmath254 of the energy of their parent partons .",
    "in contrast , the leading hadron in a 100  gev/@xmath46 jet , initiated by a light parton , carries typically only @xmath255 of the jet energy , simply because this jet fragmentation pattern is not biased by a single particle trigger . in the presence of a medium , additional `` trigger biases ''",
    "may arise .",
    "for instance , in the presence of strong final state energy loss , a high-@xmath5 particle trigger will select particles produced mainly at the outskirts of the nuclear overlap region .",
    "the parent partons of these hadrons have had a particularly small in - medium path length and thus suffered particularly little parton energy loss ( surface bias )  @xcite .",
    "also , a high-@xmath5 particle trigger will prefer events in which the initial state @xmath5-broadening effects move the dijet invariant mass towards the trigger .",
    "thirdly , triggering on a high - energy hadron or requiring a jet can lead to structures in the distribution of soft `` background '' particles , which are typically counted towards the medium , but which are related to the trigger and would not be found in minimum bias events .",
    "these general considerations prompt us to distinguish in the following discussion between `` true '' jets , jet - like particle correlations and soft structures causally related to high-@xmath5 triggers .",
    "`` true '' jet measurements , that is measurements of the _ entire _ fragmentation pattern of high-@xmath256 parent partons , have not been performed in heavy ion collisions so far . in the context of rhic data ,",
    "`` jet quenching '' refers to the suppression of single inclusive hadron spectra and high-@xmath5 particle correlations .",
    "yet , measurements at rhic , as well as models of parton energy loss , give rise to a set of general expectations for `` true '' jet measurements in heavy ion collisions :    1 .",
    "+ parton energy loss , combined with energy - momentum conservation implies that the energy lost by the leading parton or hadron in the parton shower reappears in additional multiplicity of softer fragments .",
    "the entire longitudinal jet multiplicity distribution is expected to soften , and the total jet multiplicity is expected to increase , see e.g. references  @xcite .",
    "+ essentially all models of parton energy loss assume a significant transverse momentum transfer from the medium to the jet projectile . as a consequence , parton energy loss",
    "is generally thought to be accompanied by a broadening of the jet fragmentation pattern in the plane orthogonal to the jet axis  @xcite . in case that the momentum transfer from the medium is asymmetric , for instance",
    "since the parton is embedded in a collective flow field , this jet broadening may show characteristic asymmetries  @xcite .",
    "3 .    + to date , most studies of jet medium - modifications focus on the longitudinal and transverse energy and multiplicity distributions",
    ". however , in current models of parton energy loss , the medium couples to the parton shower via gluon exchange , and thus alters the colour flow in the shower .",
    "this may be expected to affect the hadrochemical composition of the jet .",
    "also , in principle , other quantum numbers such as baryon number or flavour may be exchanged between the medium and the jet  @xcite .",
    "we note that even if the _ average _ longitudinal jet multiplicity distribution softens , it may be possible that high-@xmath5 triggered particle correlations remain insensitive to the properties of the medium .",
    "this is so , for instance , if the high-@xmath5 trigger should select the subset of parton fragmentation patterns , that escaped with a negligible medium modification e.g. due to a surface bias effect .",
    "similar remarks apply to the transverse jet multiplicity distribution and hadrochemical composition .",
    "there is a class of measurements , in which a trigger hadron of high transverse momentum @xmath257 is correlated with associated hadrons as a function of their transverse momentum @xmath258 and their azimuthal angle @xmath259 with respect to the trigger particle .",
    "we call such correlations `` jet - like '' , if @xmath258 is relatively large , @xmath260 , say . for a first theoretical work on jet - like correlations , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the generic trends seen in such correlation functions at rhic are :    1 .",
    "+   + in @xmath225 and au - au collisions at rhic , near - side ( i.e. small @xmath259 ) two - particle jet - like correlations show an enhancement characteristic of hard - scattering processes . compared to @xmath225 collisions , the yield of high-@xmath5 trigger particles decreases by a factor @xmath157 from peripheral to central au - au collisions at rhic .",
    "in contrast , jet - like two - particle correlations do not show a significant centrality dependence .",
    "for sufficiently high threshold trigger @xmath261 , the yield and @xmath262-width of the near - side distribution is insensitive to the centrality of au - au collisions , and coincides with the measurement in d - au collisions  @xcite .",

    "+   + for intermediate @xmath5 triggers ( @xmath263  gev/@xmath46 ) at rhic , the associated particle yield for @xmath264  gev/@xmath46 disappears as a function of centrality  @xcite . if one raises the trigger threshold to higher values ( @xmath265  gev/@xmath46 ) , then the back - side jet - like structure reappears again , but the yield strongly decreases with centrality .",
    "the back - side structure shows no sign of azimuthal broadening  @xcite .",
    "the above features are qualitatively consistent with a schematic all - or - nothing mechanism , based on the following picture : if a hadron is triggered on with a high @xmath257 , then it is the leading fragment of a parton shower , which propagated essentially unperturbed through the medium ( `` complete survival of entire jet structure '' ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if the parton shower is significantly perturbed by the medium , then the energy of the leading fragment is degraded to such an extent , that it becomes unlikely to find this fragment in a high-@xmath5 trigger bin ( `` no survival at all '' ) .",
    "this all - or - nothing picture may be regarded as the most extreme form of a trigger bias : the trigger selects the subclass of unmodified parton fragmentation patterns and the medium - modification establishes itself solely in the reduced yield . in this way , this all - or - nothing picture accounts for the strongly reduced yield of high-@xmath5 trigger particles , characterized e.g. by the nuclear modification factor , as well as for the suppression of the back - side yield .",
    "it can also account for the absence of broadening in both the near - side and the away - side peaks by arguing that the particle pairs entering the jet - like correlation function belong to parton showers which escaped the medium essentially without interaction and thus without signs of medium - induced broadening .",
    "the picture is also qualitatively consistent with finer features seen in the data , such as the observation that for near - side correlations , the particle yield as a function of the effective fragmentation variable @xmath266 is the same in d - au and au - au , independent of centrality ; on the away - side , the particle yield decreases with centrality but shows the same @xmath267-slope  @xcite .",
    "can such an all - or - nothing mechanism be consistent with the dynamics of qcd radiation physics ? to address this question , one may note first that for a steeply falling partonic @xmath5-distribution , it is conceivable that _ all _ high-@xmath5 trigger bins are dominated by hadrons , whose parent partons suffered no medium - induced parton energy loss  @xcite . in other words : while hadrons , whose parents suffered some medium - induced energy loss must end up in some @xmath5-bin , they can  for steeply falling distributions  always be shifted to an abundantly populated lower @xmath5-bin , in which their yield is statistically negligible .",
    "recent implementations of radiative parton energy loss can account at least qualitatively for this possibility by two features  @xcite : first , even for dense systems , recent models allow for a sizeable finite probability that the parton shower propagates unperturbed through the medium .",
    "second , the distribution of leading fragments in the parton shower turns out to be very fragile , once the parton shower has interacted with the medium . in this way",
    ", current model implementations contain the main ingredients needed for implementing a strong surface bias , which may underlie the all - or - nothing mechanism sketched above . in model studies",
    ", one has also addressed more refined questions , such as whether the surviving yield in the away - side correlation arises predominantly from particle pairs emitted tangentially to the surface of the collision region  @xcite , so that neither the trigger nor the associated recoil particle traverses a significant amount of matter .",
    "the all - or - nothing mechanism outlined here is a working hypothesis , which finds some support in rhic data and current model analyses .",
    "if true , it is a dramatic illustration that jet - like particle correlations fall short of characterizing the distributions of quenched jets , simply because they trigger mainly on the small fraction of unquenched survivor jets . to refine this all - or - nothing mechanism ( or rather : to replace it by a picture which allows for gradual manifestations of parton energy loss on jet - like correlations ) , one should study in particular correlations with lower @xmath258 .",
    "this is so , since the trigger particle of @xmath257 , to the extent to which it does not arise from a medium - independent fragmentation , should be accompanied by an increased associated yield at sufficiently small @xmath258 . at rhic , lowering @xmath258 below 2  gev/@xmath46 for au - au collisions , one has observed indeed an enhanced associated yield with clear indications of broadening of the away - side peak .",
    "however , the kinematic range @xmath268  gev/@xmath46 is difficult to disentangle from the large underlying event multiplicity and it may be affected by other mechanisms , see section  [ sec73 ] below .",
    "a trigger - biased class of jet measurements , which shows medium - modifications of associated jet multiplicity only below @xmath268  gev/@xmath46 , provides arguably only limited access to a study of the entire quenched jet fragmentation  except , of course , if one could demonstrate that this trigger bias is unimportant and that these jet - like correlations are characteristic for the _ average _ medium - modified parton shower .",
    "the wider kinematic reach of heavy ion collisions at the lhc may provide means to this end .",
    "a jet of @xmath269  gev has on average @xmath270 charged hadrons with @xmath271  gev/@xmath46 .",
    "although jet - like correlations based on single trigger particles will bias significantly the average jet fragmentation pattern , one expects qualitatively that the distribution of associated particles should show imprints of medium - modifications ( namely signs of @xmath5-broadening and enhanced yield ) in a wider range of @xmath258 , which can be disentangled more clearly from the underlying event multiplicity . however , this qualitative expectation is not yet supported by model studies .",
    "high-@xmath5 triggers affect the underlying event in hadronic collisions .",
    "for instance , in comparison to minimum bias data , triggering on a high-@xmath5 hadron in a @xmath225 collision increases the soft event multiplicity by a factor of order @xmath272 .",
    "the hard parton sits on top of a `` pedestal '' , which is wide in rapidity  @xcite . within perturbation theory ,",
    "such a pedestal may be expected , since large @xmath208-processes are accompanied by initial state radiation , which is broad in rapidity and which will manifest itself in additional low-@xmath5 hadrons . since this initial state radiation moves over long ranges with the beam fragments , non - perturbative physics may play an important role as well .",
    "also , multiple parton interactions may contribute to the pedestal effect  @xcite .",
    "the pedestal observed in high-@xmath5-triggered hadron collisions is the prototype of a phenomenon , which is clearly related to the presence of a high-@xmath208 process , but which is not due to final state parton fragmentation . as such , the pedestal is a structure in the low-@xmath5 trigger - associated particle yield , which one can not expect to reproduce in a model that superimposes a high-@xmath5 final state fragmentation pattern on the multiplicity distribution of a minimum bias event .",
    "the state of the art of modelling high-@xmath5 phenomena in heavy ion collisions is of the latter type , and one wonders whether there are  like the pedestal in @xmath225  characteristic features in heavy ion collisions , which one misses in models superimposing medium - modified hard processes on minimum bias soft background .",
    "one candidate for such a feature is the `` ridge '' : a trigger particle is accompanied by additional associated hadronic activity in some range of intermediate @xmath258 at the _ near - side only_. this additional multiplicity is wide in rapidity but , unlike the pedestal , it is not balanced by a similar amount of activity in the same range of @xmath258 on the away - side .",
    "this phenomenon may arise e.g. in a picture  @xcite , in which the pedestal is embedded in a transverse flow field .",
    "namely , triggering on a high-@xmath5 particle , one selects an interaction point which will preferably lie away from the centre of the collision region towards the direction of the trigger @xmath5 . at this point in the transverse plane",
    ", collective transverse flow is also expected to point in the direction of the trigger @xmath5 .",
    "so , any additional initial state hadronic activity , associated with this trigger , may be expected to be transported by transverse flow towards the near - side .",
    "the above is but one , albeit speculative , illustration that if one aims at studying values of @xmath258 comparable to those in the bulk multiplicity , the study of medium - modified jet measurements can not be limited to the study of medium - modified final state parton fragmentation patterns on top of minimum bias events . for low @xmath258 , it becomes difficult to establish which part of the additional hadronic activity emerges from the fragmentation and energy loss of a hard final state parton .",
    "we note that also the much - discussed , broad structures in the away - side correlations , which have been suggested to indicate the appearance of mach cones , do not persist for higher @xmath258 , but are only seen in a rather narrow range of low transverse momentum .",
    "radial flow , anisotropic flow , initial state radiation and trigger bias effects may all affect characteristic features of associated particle distributions in this low @xmath258-regime .",
    "heavy ion collisions at the lhc may help to clarify the dynamical understanding of such soft structures related to high-@xmath5 trigger particles , since the hadronic activity in both the incoming and the outgoing state is expected to increase significantly with the trigger @xmath5 , and may manifest itself in a wider range of @xmath258 .",
    "how collective phenomena emerge from the fundamental laws of elementary particle physics is a multi - faceted question , which in the range of extreme matter densities , where physics is determined by partonic degrees of freedom , has been addressed in different theoretical approaches .",
    "historically , high - temperature qcd equilibrium dynamics , studied non - perturbatively in lattice calculations or perturbatively in finite temperature field theory , has been the first theoretical approach with the potential of connecting heavy ion phenomenology with first principles of qcd . in particular , the most dramatic collective phenomenon ,",
    "expected in finite temperature qcd , namely the phase transition to a quark gluon plasma at a critical temperature and baryochemical potential , has been firmly established in lattice qcd . by now",
    ", these techniques are applied to many questions of phenomenological relevance at the lhc , including quarkonium suppression , the medium - modification of spectral functions , dissipative transport coefficients , and fluctuation measurements  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , heavy ion phenomenology has established over the last two decades strong indications that effects of directed collective motion are at least as important for understanding the dynamics of heavy ion collisions , than effects of random thermal motion .",
    "these two concepts , collective dynamics and local equilibrium , can coexist . indeed , the modelling of heavy ion collisions in terms of perfect fluid dynamics illustrates the extent to which a mesoscopic system with extreme position - momentum gradients may still maintain local thermal equilibrium . in the discussion of this hydrodynamic modelling",
    ", the emphasis has shifted gradually from fundamental tests of qcd thermodynamics ( namely whether the qcd phase transition and its order leave traces in the dynamical evolution ) to fundamental tests of qcd hydrodynamics ( namely the test of dissipative properties of the matter , such as viscosities ) .",
    "there are many reasons for this gradual shift of focus at collider energies , starting with the observation that at rhic and lhc energies one likely overshoots the critical energy density significantly , and ending with the notorious problem of identifying `` unambiguous '' signatures of the qcd phase transition . in principle",
    ", the characterization of hydrodynamic features in heavy ion collisions provides an opportunity of connecting heavy ion phenomenology to first principles in qcd , since both properties of the qcd phase transition and dissipative transport coefficients are calculable directly from the qcd lagrangian . in practice , however , one prerequisite for exploiting these opportunities is a very good experimental and theoretical control over the `` perfect fluid baseline '' on top of which one aims at establishing dissipative properties .",
    "our discussion in sections  [ s : hadrochemistry ] , [ s : anisotropic_flow ] and [ s : femtoscopy ] also identified how measurements at the lhc can help to establish whether conditions close to this perfect fluid baseline are realized at the lhc _ and _ whether they were realized at rhic .",
    "it would be an unwanted bias to limit the study of `` soft '' physics at the lhc to manifestations of qcd thermo- and hydrodynamics . in this review",
    ", we deliberately started from the observation that several apparently generic trends in the existing data ( e.g. in multiplicity distributions and collective flow ) have not yet found a satisfactory explanation .",
    "agnostic extrapolations of these trends to the lhc are at odds with the extrapolation of current models , be it hydrodynamics or saturation physics .",
    "this indicates that lhc will be a discovery machine also in the soft physics sector .",
    "in particular , the support for an interpretation of data in terms of hydrodynamics or saturation physics would be strengthened qualitatively , if one discovered at the lhc deviations from the so far apparently generic trends , which are characteristic for the currently advocated dynamical models ( such as a mild but distinct power - law @xmath13 increase of event multiplicity , or a deviation of @xmath65 from @xmath83-scaling ) .",
    "on the other hand , a confirmation of these trends may prompt us to reassess our understanding of the soft matter produced in heavy ion collisions at both lhc _ and _ rhic .",
    "lhc will also be a discovery machine outside the soft physics sector at mid - rapidity .",
    "this is so mainly because of the logarithmically wide range in transverse and longitudinal momentum , which opens up at 30 times higher @xmath4 tev .",
    "as discussed in sections  [ s : high_pt ] and [ s : high_pt2 ] , the resulting abundance of hard processes at the lhc provides many novel tools for probing the produced soft matter .",
    "the prerequisite for exploiting this opportunity is a very good experimental and theoretical control over how the medium modifies hard processes due to interactions in the final and initial state . our discussion in section  [ s : high_pt2 ] identified how measurements at the lhc can improve this control , in particular by extending jet quenching studies significantly beyond the analysis of medium - modified leading fragments .",
    "this is likely to refine our understanding of hard probes at the lhc _ and _ at rhic .",
    "it would be an unwanted bias to limit the study of hard physics at the lhc to its use as `` hard probes '' . with the significantly wider kinematic reach , heavy ion physics gains experimental access to other fundamental properties of qcd .",
    "in particular , medium modifications of the qcd - evolution in both @xmath208 ( mainly via the transverse momentum dependence ) and @xmath245 ( mainly via the rapidity and @xmath13-dependence ) become testable at the lhc . again",
    ", characteristic deviations of lhc measurements from the agnostic extrapolations discussed here may provide some of the cleanest possibilities of identifying and ultimately quantifying the manifestations of medium - dependent qcd evolution .",
