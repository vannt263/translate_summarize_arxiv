    "small noncoding rnas ( srnas ) have recently been discovered as key components of genetic regulation in systems ranging from bacteria to mammals  @xcite , and this has spurred much activity in understanding their functional advantages .",
    "for example , degradation of srna with their target mrnas has been proposed as a mechanism to obtain ultrasensitivity @xcite .",
    "one particular system which has been extensively studied is the fe - fur system in the bacterium _ escherichia coli _ which contains the regulatory srna ryhb  @xcite .",
    "this system is responsible for maintaining homeostasis of fe@xmath0 ions , which are essential for cell functioning but also poisonous at high concentrations . during aerobic exponential growth , iron - using enzymes in _ e. coli _",
    "utilize around @xmath1 fe atoms per cell generation , but more than @xmath2 fe@xmath0 ions in free or loosely - bound form is poisonous @xcite .",
    "thus , the cell faces the problem of maintaining a huge flux of fe through a small reservoir , and at the same time channeling this flux into its most essential functions when the cell is starved of iron : it needs to prioritize and sort the usage of a limited resource .",
    "reference @xcite describes a detailed model of the fe regulation in _",
    "e. coli _ , which incorporates several feedback mechanisms that together secure the system against both up and down shifts of the iron level .",
    "in this paper , we focus on the prioritization of the usage of iron by the srna regulation and its role in sudden iron depletion . the model in @xcite",
    "is simplified into a core  motif \" ( figure  [ motifs]a ) describing the negative feedback used in iron homeostasis .",
    "the motif consists of three variables , @xmath3 the iron - activated fur ( ferric uptake regulator ) protein complex that senses the fe@xmath0 level , @xmath4 , the srna ryhb , and @xmath5 , the mrna of iron - using proteins .",
    "the srna works by binding strongly to the mrna , after which this entire complex is rapidly degraded @xcite .",
    "the srna is in turn transcriptionally repressed by @xmath3 .",
    "thus , @xmath3 effectively activates @xmath5 , through a double negative link via the srna .",
    "interestingly , the regulation of iron homeostasis in the bacterium _ helicobacter pylori",
    "_ differs from that of _ e. coli _ in one important respect : the regulation via the srna ryhb is replaced by a direct transcriptional activation of the mrna @xmath5 by @xmath3 ( see figure  [ motifs]b ) @xcite .",
    "these two bacteria motivate us to compare the  srna motif \" with the corresponding  transcription motif \" .    by studying these motifs ,",
    "we demonstrate the following interesting aspects of srna regulation : ( i ) both motifs can be adjusted to have similar response times , but the metabolic cost is different for the two motifs .",
    "( ii ) a single type of srna can efficiently prioritize expression level of various downstream target mrnas , thus prioritizing the usage of a limiting resource .",
    "we also discuss possible experiments to test these results .    ,",
    "the fe - fur complex which depends on the amount of loosely bound iron , @xmath4 , the srna ryhb , and @xmath5 , the mrna of iron - using proteins .",
    "the red barred arrows between @xmath4 and @xmath5 represent the formation of the @xmath6 complex and its subsequent degradation .",
    "the other red barred arrow indicates transcriptional repression of @xmath4 by @xmath3 .",
    "the influx of @xmath3 , denoted by @xmath7 , is divided into the channel @xmath8 , regulated by @xmath5 ( green arrow ) , and the non - regulated channel @xmath9 .",
    "( b ) the transcription motif found in _",
    "h. pylori_. here , @xmath5 is transcriptionally activated by @xmath3 .",
    "[ motifs],width=302 ]",
    "in the motif of figure  [ motifs]a we focus on the case where srna binds to mrna and both rnas in the complex are degraded . in terms of an effective rate constant for the overall degradation , @xmath10 ,",
    "the dynamics of the concentrations of the srna ( @xmath4 ) and its target mrna ( @xmath5 ) can be described by @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 set the respective production rates , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 define the background degradation times .",
    "we next rescale the parameters by measuring concentrations in units of @xmath16 and measuring time in units of @xmath14 . , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "thereby , a unit of time corresponds to the degradation time of the srna , and the unit of production rates corresponds to the production rate of the target mrna . ]    to these rescaled equations we also add an equation for @xmath3 , a small - molecule - activated transcription factor for the srna ( as shown in figure  [ motifs]a ) .",
    "we simplify this two step reaction from @xmath3 to regulation by assuming that all bindings are first order , and by rescaling binding constants such that @xmath19 results in half - repression of the promoter of the srna gene . including the import and consumption of @xmath3 in analogy to the fe - fur system@xcite ,",
    "the full dynamics of the motif becomes : @xmath20 here the dimensionless mrna degradation time @xmath21 , and the dimensionless degradation rate of the rnas is related to the dimensionfull parameters as follows : @xmath22    in the absence of @xmath5 , @xmath4 is degraded relatively slowly because unbound srna are quite stable _ in vivo _ @xcite .",

    "@xcite .",
    "the most important parameters that determine the dynamics of srna regulation are @xmath25 and @xmath26 in eqs.([rs ] ) and ( [ ms ] ) .",
    "we can determine a reasonable range of values for these two parameters using experimental data .",
    "first , for the fe - fur system @xmath25 and @xmath26 are mutually constrained by the observation that the target mrna , sodb , is depleted around 5-fold within 3 minutes after full induction of the ryhb promoter@xcite .",
    "these 3 minutes include the time required for ryhb production , set by @xmath25 , plus the time for the produced ryhb to bind to sodb message and to degrade the complex , set by @xmath26 .",
    "for @xmath27 there will never be enough ryhb to deplete the message completely , whereas for @xmath25 slightly higher than 1 an extremely high @xmath26 is needed for efficient depletion .",
    "[ parameters ] illustrates this .",
    "we simulate eqs .",
    "( [ rs ] ) and ( [ ms ] ) to measure how long it takes for @xmath5 to be depleted 5-fold after fully - activating srna at @xmath28 by changing @xmath3 manually from @xmath29 to zero .",
    "the solid line in fig .",
    "[ parameters ] shows values of @xmath26 and @xmath25 that give a 3 minutes depletion - time for sodb mrna . with @xmath25 values in the range from 3 to 10",
    ", we see that physiological @xmath26 values would need to be between 100 and 10000 .",
    "in addition , the reduction of iron consumption occurs as soon as the srna - mrna complex is formed , even before the mrna is degraded , but the measurement of @xcite does not distinguish rna species in complexes from the free form .",
    "thus , the effective @xmath26 could be larger than the above estimate .",
    "the value of @xmath25 can be estimated from other data in ref .",
    "@xcite of ryhb and sodb time series after induction and repression of ryhb . from these data ,",
    "we estimate that @xmath25 is between 2 and 5 .",
    "in the rest of the paper , we explore the small rna motif for a range of @xmath25 and @xmath26 values , around the estimates made above .",
    "the three other parameters , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath7 , in the iron flux equation ( [ fs ] ) , we set using experimental data @xcite , as described in the appendix .      to model the transcription motif ( figure  [ motifs]b ) we replace ( [ rs ] ) and ( [ ms ] ) by the single equation : @xmath30 the first term models the direct transcriptional activation of @xmath5 production by @xmath3 , where @xmath31 sets the maximum production rate of @xmath5 and @xmath32 sets the binding constant between @xmath3 and the dna .",
    "the  hill coefficient \" @xmath33 sets the steepness of the response , and is related to the cooperativity in binding .",
    "we use the same values of the influx @xmath7 and two constants @xmath8 and @xmath9 in ( [ fs ] ) as those used in the srna motif .",
    "we choose @xmath31 and @xmath32 in the transcription motif to have the identical steady state values of the @xmath3 and @xmath5 to the corresponding srna motif ( parameterized by @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) for high iron ( @xmath34 ) and low iron ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "it is not obvious that this is possible for all values of @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "in fact , we found that it is not possible for @xmath36 , but when @xmath37 , we can set @xmath31 and @xmath32 such that the above conditions are fulfilled for @xmath38 $ ] and @xmath39 $ ] .",
    "therefore , henceforth we keep @xmath37 .",
    "figures  [ ss_and_dyn]a and b show how the steady state values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 depend on the steady state @xmath3 level , in the srna motif for two different @xmath26 values , and , respectively , in the corresponding transcription motif systems . for the srna motif , a larger @xmath26 results in a much larger ratio between maximum and minimum @xmath5 values , and a steeper drop between them ( figures  [ ss_and_dyn]a ) .",
    "this is expected because in the @xmath40 limit , @xmath41)$ ] , and this steepness in the srna regulation is referred to as `` ultrasensitivity '' in @xcite . for the transcription motif ,",
    "on the other hand , the dependence of @xmath5 on @xmath3 is weaker and nearly unaffected by the corresponding change in @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( figure  [ ss_and_dyn]b ) .",
    "this is because the steepness of the curve in the transcription motif is determined by the hill coefficient @xmath33 , which is set to be relatively high value 3 but still not enough to give as sharp slope as the srna motif with @xmath42 .",
    "the importance of @xmath26 is also evident in the dynamical response of the motifs to a sudden depletion in the external iron source @xmath7 ( figures  [ ss_and_dyn]c and d ) . for the srna motif ,",
    "figure  [ ss_and_dyn]c shows that a larger @xmath26 results in a faster drop in @xmath5 level , and a quicker approach to the new steady state level .",
    "the same is true for the @xmath3 level also .",
    "that is , a large @xmath26 naturally ensures a faster removal of all excess @xmath5 , while also allowing @xmath3 and @xmath5 to climb back to non - zero steady levels even after @xmath3 drops almost to zero during the initial shock .",
    "in contrast , the transcription motif displays approximately the same timescale of mrna drop for the two corresponding cases because a drop in @xmath5 takes a time proportional to @xmath15 , independent of other parameters .",
    ", at which @xmath3 recovers to and subsequently remains within 95% of the final steady state value .",
    "the corresponding transcription motif systems show a faster response in the shaded region .",
    "[ contour ] , width=302 ]    we investigate this further by quantifying the response time .",
    "looking at figure  [ ss_and_dyn]c , we see that the @xmath3 level drops very sharply and then rises towards its final steady state value . during this rise , at some time , @xmath43 , @xmath3 reaches within 95% of the final steady state value .",
    "we use @xmath43 as a measure of the response speed of the system . in figure",
    "[ contour ] we show a contour plot of @xmath43 for a range of values of @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the corresponding transcription motif systems show a faster response than the srna motif in the shaded region .",
    "the comparison indicates that srna based translational regulation produces a faster response than transcriptional regulation when @xmath44 ( and @xmath25 is not too large compared to the investigated range of @xmath3 ) and @xmath26 is larger than a critical level , around 150 ( the unshaded region in figure  [ contour ] ) .",
    "the relatively slow response of the transcription motif is , of course , because its response timescale is set by @xmath15 , which we keep constant .",
    "we emphasize that it is possible to achieve a fast response in the transcription motif also by decreasing @xmath15 .",
    "there are some costs associated with this alternative strategy though .",
    "faster mrna turnover due to lower @xmath15 requires a higher production to maintain the same homeostatic levels of @xmath3 . at high @xmath3 levels , where mrna is high , the srna motif secures a low degradation rate of mrna , whereas the transcription motif produces the mrna at its maximum rate . on the other hand , at low @xmath3 the srna motif maintains a high rate of mrna degradation , while the transcription motif saves resources by reducing mrna production .",
    "therefore , for a given response speed to sudden iron starvation , the srna motif is less costly if the bacterium usually lives in iron - rich conditions , whereas the transcription motif is preferable if the organism mostly lives in iron - poor conditions .",
    "the properties of srna regulation can be used in an interesting way when more than one kind of mrna is under regulation @xcite .",
    "different mrna can have hugely different binding strengths to the regulating srna , and thereby very different effective degradation timescales .",
    "this is because the binding strength of the @xmath4-@xmath5 complex is , to a first approximation , an exponential function of the number of matching base - pairs , which can vary by an order of magnitude across different mrna : the free - energy gain per matching base - pair is around 1 to 2 kcal / mol , which can give the difference in statistical weight @xmath45 to 30 .",
    "because of this property , srna regulation could be used to prioritize the degradation of different mrna .",
    "we illustrate this by adding a second mrna to the srna motif : @xmath46 for @xmath3 , we use ( [ fs ] ) , replacing @xmath5 by @xmath47 .",
    "the two mrnas , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , have different effective degradation rates , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , resulting in different steady state levels for a given @xmath7 value .",
    "other parameters are set as in the case with a single mrna .",
    "figure  [ sorting ] shows the behavior of this system . the steady state level in figure",
    "[ sorting]a shows that @xmath49 , the mrna with larger @xmath26 , is suppressed more than @xmath48 on depletion of @xmath3 .",
    "the prioritization behavior is easily understood by considering the extreme case where both @xmath26s are very large but @xmath52 .",
    "then , depending on the level of @xmath3 , the steady state is such that either ( i ) both mrnas are near - zero , ( ii ) only @xmath48 is non - zero , ( iii ) both @xmath48 and @xmath49 are non - zero .    taking into account finite @xmath26 values",
    ", the prioritization efficiency becomes , respectively ,    * @xmath53 and @xmath54 for small @xmath3 , i.e. @xmath55 , * @xmath56 and @xmath57 for intermediate @xmath3 , i.e. @xmath58 , * @xmath59 and @xmath60 for large @xmath3 , i.e. @xmath61 .    where the @xmath62 are some functions that are small and proportional to @xmath63 for small @xmath63 .",
    "case ( ii ) is what we refer to as the  prioritized state \" , where only one of the mrna ( the one with smaller @xmath26 ) is present and the other s level drops to near - zero . clearly , the larger the difference between the @xmath26 values of the mrnas , the better the prioritization ; the order of magnitude difference in @xmath26 is important to have the clear prioritization . in addition",
    ", @xmath25 , the srna production rate , determines the range of @xmath3 for which the srna is affected , and a larger @xmath25 results in prioritization being effective for a wider range of @xmath3 .",
    "in addition , the dynamics in figure  [ sorting]b shows that , when @xmath7 is suddenly dropped , the mrna with a larger @xmath26 value is rapidly depleted while the other mrna stays at a higher level .",
    "that is , the srna is not only able to prioritize the mrna steady state levels , but is also able to remove the `` unwanted '' mrna @xmath49 much quicker than the `` wanted '' mrna @xmath48 .",
    "it is clear that the prioritization can be generalized to the case of more than two kinds of mrnas regulated by a single type of srna .",
    "to illustrate this we ignore feedback through @xmath3 and consider the following general system with @xmath64 different types of mrnas : @xmath65 here , to focus on the prioritization , the production term of srna in ( [ 2rs ] ) which contains feedback from iron concentration is replaced by a constant @xmath66 .",
    "we assume @xmath67 without loss of generality , and rescale all variables to be dimensionless such that @xmath68 and the degradation time of srna are unity .",
    "figure [ sortingsimple]a shows the normalized steady state level of mrnas , @xmath69 , versus the production rate of the srna , @xmath66 . as @xmath66 becomes larger , srna increases and more mrnas are degraded . as shown in figure [ sortingsimple]a , the @xmath64-th mrna with the largest @xmath26",
    "is degraded first .",
    "this also `` protects '' other mrnas from degradation because the srnas are also degraded together with the @xmath64-th mrnas .",
    "the ( @xmath70)-th mrna starts to be degraded when the level of @xmath64-th mrna becomes low enough , which occurs roughly at @xmath71 .",
    "the ( @xmath72)-th mrna starts to be degraded when @xmath73 , and so on , and finally all the mrnas are almost completely degraded when @xmath74 .",
    "the separation of the level between the ( @xmath75)-th mrna and the @xmath76-th mrna for @xmath77 becomes clearer for larger difference between @xmath78 and @xmath79 for any @xmath80 , the steady state level of mrna for @xmath81 is estimated as follows : @xmath82 for @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 for @xmath86 .",
    "this multistep - switch - like degradation upon changing the value of @xmath66 is the characteristic feature of the srna regulation .",
    "this prioritization mechanism is schematically presented in figure [ sortfig ] , where the mrnas are degraded in descending order of the value of @xmath26 .",
    "( left boxes ) .",
    "( a ) when a small amount of srnas is produced , the mrnas with larger @xmath26 are degraded ( shaded region in the right box ) , while the levels of mrnas with small @xmath26 are scarcely affected .",
    "( b ) as more srna is produced , the mrnas with smaller @xmath26 are also degraded .",
    ", width=302 ]    we note that it is possible to have different steady state of mrnas in the transcriptional motif also .",
    "suppose @xmath4 is the concentration of the repressor with a production rate @xmath66 .",
    "then the simplest model for the mrna level is @xmath87 with a hill coefficient @xmath33 and binding constants @xmath88 ; we assume @xmath89 without loss of generality . here , the variables are rescaled to be dimensionless such that @xmath90 and the degradation time of @xmath4 are unity .",
    "the normalized steady state level is given by @xmath91 : the levels decrease as @xmath66 increases with the slope determined by the hill coefficient @xmath33 , and the characteristic value of @xmath66 where the @xmath92 level becomes half of its maximum is given by @xmath88 .",
    "figure  [ sortingsimple]b shows the separation of the steady state by transcription regulation with a relatively high value of the hill coefficient @xmath37 and various values of @xmath88 .",
    "we see that the separation of the @xmath92 level is not as sharp as with srna regulation , and @xmath92 does not change much upon changing @xmath66 especially for large @xmath88 .",
    "the srna regulation is more effective in the sense that the prioritization of the mrnas is sensitive to small changes in @xmath66 .",
    "our analysis pinpoints three features that are particular to srna regulation in a feedback system .",
    "first , as srnas act through degradation , the regulation can , in principle , be very fast , generating a near instant response .",
    "second , as the srna motif uses a double negative link , instead of a direct activation regulation , it has a higher metabolic cost for conditions where downstream targets are repressed .",
    "third , and most interestingly , it has the capability of efficiently prioritizing the usage of downstream target genes .",
    "it is essential for the prioritized expression of downstream targets that the srna as well as the mrnas are degraded together after they form a complex . in the large @xmath26 limit",
    ", the effective prioritization occurs because the degradation of @xmath49 interferes with the degradation of @xmath48 by sequestering @xmath4 , leaving less unbound @xmath4 to bind @xmath48 .",
    "indeed , if the srna simply catalyzed the degradation of the mrnas without itself being degraded ( i.e. , no @xmath93 terms in ( [ 2rs ] ) or ( [ mrss ] ) ) , the  protection \" of @xmath48 is also lost .",
    "the degradation of different mrnas does nt interfere as in the previous case , and thus the prioritization is less effective .",
    "the switch - like behavior due to the `` ultrasensitivity '' of the srna regulation @xcite together with the prioritization suggested in this work opens the possibility of more sophisticated regulation of gene expression . in particular , if each mrna is targeted by several kinds of srnas , the combinatorics allows one to realize various logic gates .",
    "for example , if different kinds of srnas can bind to the same part of the targeted mrna to trigger the regulation , it behaves as an `` or '' gate .",
    "such an example is known in _ v. cholerae _",
    ", where four different srnas regulate hapr and any one of them is enough for regulation@xcite .",
    "it is also , in principle , possible that one mrna has multiple binding sites for different srnas . in this case , if binding of all the srnas is necessary to trigger the regulation , it realizes an `` and '' gate .",
    "the concentration dependent prioritization can add more complicated functions to the logic gates .",
    "it is an interesting future issue to explore the possibility of combinatoric regulation by srnas .",
    "we have tested numerically that the results of this paper do not strongly depend on the specific form of ( [ fs ] ) for @xmath3 .",
    "as long as in- and out - fluxes are large enough to allow a much faster response of @xmath3 than of @xmath5 , then @xmath5 is the rate - limiting factor .",
    "another thing to note is that we assumed that the hill coefficient for the repression of srna by @xmath3 is 1 , though we introduced a hill coefficient @xmath37 in the transcription motif to achieve the sharp contrast in @xmath5 at high and low @xmath3 .",
    "if we put a hill coefficient @xmath94 in the srna motif by replacing the production term of @xmath4 with @xmath95 , the @xmath5 vs. @xmath3 curve becomes even steeper , which makes the response sharper .",
    "the suggested prioritization possibility for downstream mrnas invites experimental tests .",
    "one key quantity of interest is the degradation parameter @xmath26 , which in fact sets the efficiency of the whole srna regulatory system . for large @xmath26 ,",
    "the srna regulation works as a step function : when production of srna is larger than production of downstream targets , these are instantly removed .",
    "therefore it is essential to measure degradation times of downstream targets under various expression levels of the srna .",
    "these degradation times are tightly coupled to the steady state level of downstream mrna , and could therefore be obtained from bulk measurements , using for example microarrays for both ryhb and downstream targets . for a given @xmath4 ( = srna ) in the steady state , the downstream mrna level is @xmath96 , and therefore the slope of @xmath97 versus @xmath4 gives @xmath98 .",
    "an experimental test of the prioritization capability of the ryhb system is to consider homeostasis , and compare wild type with any mutant where the ryhb binding part of a downstream target gene is highly over - expressed .",
    "the over - expressed genes should be constructed such that they do not produce proteins that can bind fe , and thereby indirectly influence the free / loosely bound fe pool . for a given low level of external iron",
    ", the prioritized usage implies that for mutants where the over - expressed gene has small @xmath26 the expression levels of other genes would be almost the same as in wild type . for the remaining",
    ", there will be large changes associated to ryhb being depleted by the over - expressed gene with large @xmath26 .",
    "if the difference in @xmath26 between different target mrna is of an order of magnitude , i.e. , enough to have clear prioritization , the influence of the over - expressed gene should be quite sharp .",
    "further , our prioritization scheme implies that as the external fe is depleted further , the number of downstream genes which influence homeostasis should diminish monotonically .",
    "using the well characterized homeostatic response system for iron in bacteria , we analyzed the pros and cons of srna versus transcription regulation .",
    "the investigated negative feedback motif of fe @xmath99 fefur @xmath99 proteins @xmath99 fe brings out the functional similarities and differences between the two alternative strategies of regulating downstream targets . for sufficiently high hill coefficients ,",
    "transcriptional regulation can reproduce the same steady state behavior as the srna regulation .",
    "further , both regulations can in principle provide a fast response to sudden decreases in externally available iron . however , their functional capabilities differ in two important aspects .",
    "* first , adjusting parameters to obtain similar response times , the srna motif results in more turnover of target mrnas in iron - poor conditions , whereas the transcription motif results in more turnover in iron - rich conditions . * second , the srna allows a prioritization of expression level of downstream targets , thus efficiently regulating the usage of a limiting iron resource . at the same time , unwanted mrna is degraded more rapidly .",
    "this observation fits with the fact that the transcription motif is found in _",
    "h. pylori _ , a bacterium with a small genome and limited capacity for genome regulation , while _ e. coli _ , which has a larger genome and can benefit from fine tuning of mrna levels , has an srna motif .",
    "our analysis suggests new ways to analyze other systems where multiple srnas regulate a more complicated response , including for example quorum sensing  @xcite .",
    "there , mutual binding inhibition between the srnas and a central regulator ( luxr mrna in _ v. harveyi _",
    "@xcite , hapr mrna in _ v. cholerae _",
    "@xcite , and the translational regulator rsma in pseudomonas @xcite ) , may allow signals from adhesion and host factors to differentiate the srnas and thereby their downstream targets .",
    "overall , our analysis suggests that srnas or micro rnas may allow a near - digital reorganization of cellular composition , an observation which concurs with their ubiquity in regulatory processes associated with development .",

    "the value of @xmath8 is completely determined by the steady state level of @xmath5 , which depends on the parameters in the regulation part of the motif ( i.e. , @xmath25 and @xmath26 in the srna motif , or @xmath31 and @xmath32 in the transcription motif ) . for iron - starvation",

    "this condition is achieved by reducing @xmath7 , reflecting the reduction in extracellular iron .",
    "the @xmath7 change needed to get @xmath35 is dependent on the values of the regulation part of the motif .",

    "<S> firstly , we show that srna regulation can maintain a smaller turnover of target mrnas than transcriptional regulation , without sacrificing the speed of response to external shocks . secondly , we propose that a single srna can prioritize the usage of different target mrnas . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that srna regulation would be more common in more complex systems which need to co - regulate many mrnas efficiently .    </S>",
