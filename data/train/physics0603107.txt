    "a quantum system in direct contact with its immediate environment is of considerable practical interest to current and future efforts in quantum engineering .",
    "it is well understood that environment induced decoherence is a direct cause of the transition between quantum coherence and classical dissipation and diffusion @xcite . in a sample of dilute bosons , for example",
    ", dissipation , macroscopic loss of atoms , and thermal contamination can singly or simultaneously destroy the stability and coherence of the condensate and its wavefunction .    in order to manufacture a quantifiable and reproducible heating effect on ultracold atoms we utilize a kicked rotor . in connection with ultracold atoms ,",
    "the kicked rotor has a very rich history @xcite and is frequently associated with the quantum mechanical phenomenon of dynamical localization @xcite .",
    "the question of whether dynamically or spatially extended macroscopic quantum behavior can be realized has also been deeply explored for over a decade with ultracold atoms .",
    "the most natural and ideal experimental testing ground has been that of periodically kicked systems which can be used to distinguish classical diffusion from the purely quantum mechanical behavior of dynamical localization .",
    "analogously , recent experiments have also explored the possibility of seeing anderson - like localization in spatially random ( disordered ) media @xcite .",
    "these results have a classical description but their work optimistically suggests that such systems can also reveal , in a complementary manner to dynamical localization , a distinction between classically induced - disorder localization and a quantum suppression of spatial diffusion .",
    "in contrast to prior work involving the kicked rotor , in this work , we report a study of a driven dilute bose gas confined in a quasi-1d finite optical billiard . instead of dynamical localization , we observe a classical saturation of the energy of the atoms due to a competition between additional energy from a kicked rotor and finite boundaries that allow energetic atoms to leave . from a phase space density representation ,",
    "we characterize the heating rates of this system for both bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) and thermal atoms .",
    "we also measure the bec fraction as a function of number of kicks and identify a correlation between collisions and a rapid loss in phase space density .",
    "we observe that bec atoms are more sensitive to heating effects than thermal atoms .",
    "in this experiment , a zeeman - slower loaded magneto - optical trap of @xmath0 sodium atoms is used to produce @xmath1 bose - einstein condensate atoms in the @xmath2 state in a cloverleaf ioffe - pritchard type magnetic trap @xcite with trapping frequencies of @xmath3hz and @xmath4hz in the radial and axial directions respectively .",
    "we then create a magnetic waveguide by lowering only the axial trapping frequency to @xmath5hz in @xmath6ms .",
    "specific details of the creation , flatness , and isotropy of the magnetic waveguide are provided in @xcite .",
    "the atoms are now confined axially using two billiard beams , which are described below .",
    "this procedure has negligible heating effect and can efficiently transfer over @xmath7 atoms with condensate fractions of up to @xmath8 .",
    "lifetimes in this hybrid trap have been measured to be nearly @xmath9 seconds .",
    "similarly , there is no measurable increase in the thermal fraction or temperature for over @xmath10 second .     so that the intensity profiles are not saturated.,title=\"fig:\",width=226,height=151 ]   so that the intensity profiles are not saturated.,title=\"fig:\",width=245,height=177 ]    the finite potential barriers of the billiard are created by two far - off - resonance ( @xmath11 nm ) optical billiard beams .",
    "the location and power of each of the billiard beams are controlled in real time by an acousto - optic deflector ( aod ) .",
    "each of the beams forms a repulsive barrier in the axial direction and together they form the end caps for the atoms in the waveguide .",
    "they are separated by @xmath12 m along the waveguide axis and have an asymmetric spot size ( @xmath13 ) at the location of the atoms of @xmath14 m by @xmath15 m in the axial and radial directions respectively .",
    "each beam creates a potential barrier height of @xmath16khz ( @xmath17k ) , which can hold atoms with a velocity of up to @xmath18cm / s @xcite .",
    "the size of the billiard is chosen to mode match the transfer into the billiard .",
    "this mode matching helped minimize the heating during the magnetic field transformation .",
    "two independent techniques were used to determine the axial spot size , @xmath19 .",
    "the first technique was to measure the transmission probability through a single barrier with a known amount of laser power .",
    "the second technique was to measure the evolution of the aspect ratio of a bec released from the billiard when the beams are very close to each other .",
    "the two techniques give a consistent value for @xmath19 .",
    "additionally , the rayleigh length , @xmath20 , for the axial spot size is @xmath21 m which is much larger than @xmath22 , the radial extent of the atoms in the waveguide . in the radial direction",
    "the waist of each beam is @xmath23 times larger than the measured spatial extent of the atoms ( @xmath24 m ) , thereby causing deviations in the potential uniformity in the radial direction by @xmath25% .",
    "the experimental sequence is as follows : bec atoms are held in the billiard while being kicked , @xmath26 times , by the kicked rotor beams , which are described below . between consecutive kicks ,",
    "the atoms undergo free evolution inside the quasi-1d billiard .",
    "we then measure the momentum distribution of the atoms after @xmath27ms of free expansion .",
    "the rms width of the distribution is used to calculate the energy along the axial and radial directions .",
    "in order to create the kicked rotor beams with the same spatial profiles as the billiard beams but different deflection angles , an arbitrary waveform generator is also used to control the same aod . by applying the billiard and kicked rotor signals simultaneously , the desired spatial pattern of light can be drawn at the location of the atoms . as shown in fig.@xmath28[f.1](a ) , the kicked rotor is made up of five equally spaced beams contained within the billiard beams .",
    "the distance between adjacent beams is @xmath29 m .    as a benchmark for our experiment",
    ", we characterize the parameter space of our kicked rotor by the standard kicked rotor model . since the standard theory for a kicked rotor assumes a sinusoidal potential for the kicks , the inner spacing for our kicked rotor",
    "is chosen to emulate the sinusoidal characteristic of the intensity profile which determines , in a linear fashion , the amplitude of the potential @xmath30 . for a fixed length of @xmath12 m for our billiard , a five spot kicked rotor best approximates a sinusoidal potential .",
    "the size of the billiard and the corresponding number of spots for the kicked rotor was varied from @xmath31 , but this variation did not change the major results reported here . for the data presented in this paper ,",
    "the power of each kicked rotor beam , after subtracting the light - offset due to overlapping gaussian beams , is @xmath32mw , which corresponds to a potential height of @xmath33khz .",
    "the nearly sinusoidal potential , as shown in fig.@xmath28[f.1](b ) , corresponds to a characteristic momentum of @xmath34mm / s , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 m .",
    "the scaled kicked rotor hamiltonian is @xmath37 . here , the scaled momentum is written as @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the measured momentum and @xmath40 is a dimensionless parameter equal to @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath42 is the kick period , @xmath26 is the total number of kicks , and @xmath43 .",
    "the displacement of each atom in the axial direction is given by @xmath44 and @xmath45 measures time in units of the kick period .",
    "the stochasticity parameter , @xmath46 , determines the classical evolution of the system and can be written in dimensionless form as @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the finite pulse of the kicked rotor .",
    "when @xmath49 widespread chaos appears in a classical system leading to unbounded motion in phase space @xcite . for our experimental parameters , @xmath46 ranges from @xmath50 to @xmath51 and @xmath40 ranges from @xmath52 to @xmath53 for @xmath54 to @xmath55ms , respectively .",
    "since the optical pulses are restricted to have a finite width in time there is a classical momentum boundary for a particular pulse time which is given by @xmath56 .",
    "for the data presented in this paper , @xmath57s , and therefore @xmath58 becomes fixed at @xmath27cm / s ( @xmath59k ) , which is significantly higher than the barrier height and consequently higher than any energy measured .",
    "in contrast , the theory of the quantum kicked rotor predicts two non - classical results : the _ quantum break time _ or localization time , @xmath60 , and the _ quantum break energy _ , @xmath61 . for our experimental parameters ,",
    "@xmath62 is calculated to occur when @xmath63 and @xmath64 is found to be @xmath65k , corresponding to a velocity of @xmath66cm / s .",
    "these conditions are also never realized for this system since the barrier height is lower than @xmath64 .",
    "the dependence of energy and atom number on the number of kicks is presented in figs .",
    "[ f.2 ] . after a large number of kicks , typically @xmath67 , the energy of the system reaches a saturation value .",
    "the origin of this saturation in energy is purely classical and can be explained by considering the loss of high energy atoms over the barriers .",
    "the finite size of the barriers puts an inherent cutoff on the maximum energy that the atoms can possess in thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "this results in the system reaching a _ nonequilibrium steady state _ where the input of energy from each additional kick is exactly balanced with the energy lost due to the subsequent removal of the hottest atoms over the finite potential barrier .    figs .",
    "[ f.2](a ) and ( b ) present contrasting examples of energy growth along the axial and radial directions . for short time between kicks ,",
    "the axial and radial energies evolve very differently in their final values .",
    "if sufficient time passes between kicks ( @xmath68ms ) , then collisions play a major role in thermalizing the axial and radial components .",

    "[ f.2](a ) also shows that there is heating in the radial direction associated with the kicked rotor .",
    "it is likely that the radial kick strength is a consequence of a slight misalignment of the kicked rotor beams with respect to the waveguide , leading to a quantifiable , minimum heating rate . as mentioned before , the miminum potential uniformity in the radial direction is about @xmath9% , but the effect of misalignment is different from the effect of collisional interactions .",
    "the effect of misalignment is independent of the time period between kicks .",
    "our data reveals that this coupling between the radial and axial directions is dependent on the time period which is a property of collisional interactions , not misalignment .    in fig .",
    "[ f.3 ] , energy measurements are made for both the axial and radial directions after @xmath76 kicks . for short kick periods ,",
    "@xmath77ms , mixing increases between the axial and radial directions but remains stably separate up to @xmath76 kicks . for @xmath78ms ,",
    "the system becomes completely ergodic at @xmath76 kicks .",
    "it can also be seen that the atom loss rate is relatively constant for @xmath79 kicks for all kick periods .",
    "the fact that the atom number after @xmath80 kicks is nearly the same for all kick periods suggests that the atom loss rate is mostly due to the same amount of energy being added from each kick .    in both figs .",
    "( [ f.2 ] ) and ( [ f.3 ] ) , the result from a quantum numerical simulation is added for comparison with our data .",
    "the numerical simulation utilizes a discrete variable representation in order to approximate the hamiltonian of our system @xcite .",
    "the simulation assumes an initial sample of non - interacting thermal atoms with a constant collision rate of @xmath81hz .",
    "this assumption is consistent with the calculated initial value for the collision rate between atoms , namely , @xmath82hz , where @xmath83 is the mean density , @xmath84 is the collision cross section for sodium atoms , and @xmath85 is the rms velocity of atoms , which is initially measured to be @xmath86mm / s .",
    "most importantly , the simulation uses the exact optically - constructed potential used in the experiment as depicted in fig .",

    ", the simulation agrees very well for large kick periods where there is complete thermalization between axial and radial directions .",
    "when the model assumes there are no collisions between atoms , as shown in fig .",
    "( [ f.3 ] ) , the energy in the axial direction , @xmath70 , after @xmath76 kicks is independent of the kick period .",
    "this theoretical result confirms that collisions are necessary for mixing the two degrees of freedom .",
    "it also implies that any energy imparted radially must come from collisions and not directly from the kicks .",

    "[ f.4](a ) . here , a three dimensional phase space density is calculated using @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the thermal de broglie wavelength in the corresponding direction and @xmath89 is the density .",
    "two significant features warrant discussion .",
    "first , there is a marked difference between the initial psd decay rates for bec and thermal atoms .",
    "this difference is due largely to the comparable energy scale of the initial energy of the bec , @xmath90nk , and the energy added by a single kick , roughly @xmath91nk .",
    "consequently , only a few kicks are required to cause the bec atoms to be heated above their critical temperature , @xmath92 @xcite , which for our system is @xmath93nk .",
    "the atoms then follow the same psd trajectory as thermal atoms . on the other hand , in the case of thermal atoms ,",
    "the energy from a single kick is only a fraction of the initial energy , @xmath94k .",
    "the second , more remarkable feature of the psd plot applies to the time dependent behavior of both bec and thermal atoms . for both bec and thermal atom initial conditions , experimentally fitted exponential decay rates in psd are identical for large @xmath26 , i.e. , for times after a nonequilibrium steady state has been achieved . in both cases ,",
    "bec and thermal atoms achieve a nonequilibrium steady state that is independent of the kick period .    for small number of kicks , @xmath95 ,",
    "the measured exponential decay rate in psd for bec atoms is nearly seven times as fast as for thermal atoms .",
    "this exponential decay rate is coincident with a rapid decay in the condensate fraction , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f.4](b ) .",
    "data for the condensate fraction decay rate indicates that there are two distinct time scales , one for short kick periods @xmath96ms and one for the long kick periods @xmath97ms . for the short kick periods ,",
    "the number of collisions is approximately @xmath50% that of a longer kick periods .",
    "this implies that , for small @xmath26 and small @xmath42 , the condensate atoms remain unaffected by the thermal atoms between kicks .    , @xmath98 data points were taken for both thermal and bec atoms for n = 3 kicks .",
    "( b ) experimental data is sorted into short kick periods , @xmath99ms ( solid squares ) , and long kick periods , @xmath100ms ( solid circles ) .",
    "note that bec fractions below @xmath101% are not reliable .",
    "the insets are time of flight ( @xmath27ms ) axial profiles for @xmath102 kicks and @xmath103 kicks for @xmath104ms.,title=\"fig:\",width=245,height=177 ] , @xmath98 data points were taken for both thermal and bec atoms for n = 3 kicks .",

    "the system we report on is a classic driven system with loss @xcite .",
    "it is a system that , for a sufficient number of kicks , can be characterized by a simple decay rate of energetic atoms escaping from the billiard . in this system ,",
    "collisions play a dominant role in irreversibly mixing the axial and radial energies .",
    "collisions , however , do not cause the onset of a nonequilibrium steady state .",
    "we showed that the monotonic addition of energy from an initial kick ( @xmath105 ) causes the sharp rise in energy and hence , the sharp decrease in psd in a sample that is initially bec .",
    "since thermal atoms begin with an energy which is higher than the single kick energy , the additional energy from an initial kick is not as high . in the case of a bec ,",
    "we have seen that there seems to be a one to one correspondence between the loss of bec fraction with a rapid drop in the phase space density    this study is relevant to most conservative atom traps with finite trap depth and measurable heating rate . in the future ,",
    "very careful calorimetry measurements can be done to elucidate the nature in which small excitation affect and ultimately destroy condensate atoms .",
