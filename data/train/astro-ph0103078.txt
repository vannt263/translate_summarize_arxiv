    "the cosmic infrared background ( cib ) is an important cosmological constraint on the star formation history in the universe @xcite .",
    "the first detection of the cib was reported by @xcite for sub - millimetric wavelengths using data from the far infrared absolute spectrometer ( firas ) on - board the cosmic background explorer ( cobe ) .",
    "shorter wavelengths have been investigated with the help of the cobe diffuse infrared background experiment ( dirbe ) from 240  @xmath2 m to 1.25  @xmath2 m .",
    "@xcite measured the cib at 240 and 140  @xmath2 m and set upper limit for other wavelengths .",
    "@xcite proposed an estimation of the cib at 100  @xmath2 m .",
    "the cib is the signal that remains after subtracting from the total celestial brightness the emission from the interstellar medium , stars and interplanetary dust ( scattering and emission ) .",
    "however , estimating the contamination due to these three foreground components is challenging .",
    "the interstellar medium is the main contaminant for long wavelengths whereas starlight and zodiacal light dominate at wavelengths studied in the present paper ( @xmath14  @xmath2 m and @xmath15  @xmath2 m ) .",
    "stellar population models were used to estimate the brightness of starlight in the large beam dirbe data @xcite but this technique led only to upper limits .",
    "detections of the cib at 3.5  @xmath2 m ( @xmath16 ) and 2.2  @xmath2 m ( k ) were reported by @xcite using near - infrared observations of a @xmath17 dark spot to measure the brightness of stars in a few dirbe beams .",
    "@xcite confirmed the result at 2.2  @xmath2 m and proposed a weak limit for 1.25  @xmath2 m ( @xmath1 ) using data from the 2 micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ) for 4 dark spots . @xcite",
    "estimated the cib from 1.4  @xmath2 m to 4  @xmath2 m with the near infrared spectrometer ( nirs ) on - board the infrared telescope in space ( irts ) .",
    "although nirs provided a point source catalog limited to stars brighter than 7.5  mag at 2.24  @xmath2 m , significant stellar contamination remains and the cib estimate is strongly dependent on the stellar population model used to remove contribution from fainter stars .",
    "this work presents a large scale study of the cib using 2mass data for 1400  deg@xmath5 of the sky in order to estimate accurately the stellar contribution to the surface brightness observed by dirbe .",
    "section  [ data ] describes the 2mass and dirbe data .",
    "the method used to compare these two data sets is presented is section  [ method ] , and the following section presents the determination of the cib for @xmath1 and @xmath3 with the associated uncertainties .",
    "section  [ discussion ] is dedicated to the comparison with previous results and with galaxy counts .",
    "the 2mass second incremental data release from the 2mass survey covers 48% of the sky and contains @xmath18 stars @xcite .",
    "the point source catalog completeness limits are 15.8 and 14.3  mag with a signal - to - noise ratio greater than 10:1 for @xmath1 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "no photometry is provided for stars brighter than 4 - 5  mag ( see sect .",
    "[ verybright ] ) .",
    "since the catalog of the whole release is @xmath20 gb in binary format , we choose to work on integrated maps in which each pixel corresponds to the integrated flux in a @xmath21 box .",
    "these maps are constructed from the point source catalog clipped to remove sources fainter than the completeness limit .",
    "magnitudes are converted to flux density using the flux for zero magnitude @xmath22  jy defined by @xcite and @xmath23  jy which is an extrapolation of the @xmath1 value to the @xmath19 filter assuming a black body at 9700  k ( vega photometric system ) .",
    "uncertainties on these photometric zero points are about 2% and do not affect our results .",
    "each @xmath21 box contains the sum of the point source fluxes in the area .",
    "the resulting image in an aitoff ( equal area ) projection consists of @xmath24 pixels .",
    "this size is reasonable and the image can be handled globally .",
    "errors resulting from this pixelization are negligible since @xmath25 is small compared to the dirbe beam of @xmath26 ( see below )",
    ".    we should point out that the 2mass @xmath19 filter ( 2.17  @xmath2 m ) and the dirbe @xmath3 filter ( 2.2  @xmath2 m ) are slightly different .",
    "@xcite discuss the @xmath3 to @xmath19 transformation and present a list of photometric standards in both colors .",
    "moreover , as @xcite point out , the @xmath19 bandpass is intermediate between @xmath3 and @xmath27 and rough corrections of @xmath19 to @xmath3 can be obtained by averaging between @xmath27 and @xmath3 .",
    "this transformation is well defined by @xcite : @xmath28 for @xmath29 ( @xmath30 otherwise ) .",
    "hence , for a k5 spectral type star we would obtain @xmath31 for example .",
    "this correction is negligible compared to uncertainties described further in the paper and differences between 2mass and dirbe filters will be ignored in the following analysis .",
    "cryogenic dirbe operation took place from 1989 december to 1990 september . during these 10 months",
    ", the sky was observed at the rate of half of the sky per week in 10 bands from 1.25  @xmath2 m to 240  @xmath2 m @xcite .",
    "the dirbe instrument was designed to make accurate absolute sky brightness measurements , with a straylight rejection of @xmath32  nw  m@xmath9  sr@xmath7 and an absolute brightness calibration uncertainty of 0.05 and 0.03  nw  m@xmath9  sr@xmath7 , at 1.25 and 2.2  @xmath2 m , respectively .",
    "the zodiacal light is the first component along the light of sight and must be removed using a dust interplanetary model ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". however these models are not unique ( see @xcite for another model ) . artifacts still remain . in the following analysis , we use the zodi - subtracted mission average ( zsma ) maps produced by the dirbe team @xcite .",
    "the zodiacal light intensities were subtracted week by week and the residual intensity values were averaged to create the zsma maps .    to compare dirbe and 2mass , we need a precise knowledge of the dirbe beam in both @xmath1 and @xmath3 bands .",
    "the @xmath33 beam size commonly mentioned in the literature is only valid for daily maps , not the annual maps used here .",
    "the beam for the @xmath1 band is presented in the figure  [ dirbejbeam ] .",
    "this is an effective beam profile ( provided with dirbe maps ) , which measures the relative response of dirbe to a point source , including the effects of sky - scanning and data - sampling rates .",
    "the beam for the annual maps corresponds to an average of the effective beam for all orientations ( fig .",
    "[ dirbejbeam ] ) .",
    "similar results are obtained for @xmath1 and @xmath3 and the full width half maximum of both beams is @xmath34 ( solid angle @xmath35  deg@xmath5 ) .",
    "first , we exclude from this study regions of the sky for which we know that the cib can not be straightforwardly extracted , for example due to high stellar density fields , interstellar cirrus ( which is responsible for emission and scattering ) , and regions of residual zodiacal light structures in the dirbe maps .",
    "we keep only regions that satisfy the following criteria :    * high galactic latitude : @xmath36 * low dirbe 240  @xmath2 m flux in order to eliminate diffuse emission or scattered light from cirrus clouds : @xmath37  mjy  sr@xmath7 * high ecliptic latitude : @xmath38 * exclusion of the magellanic clouds    the most straightforward way to remove the stellar component ( 2mass ) from the dirbe flux is to work directly in the cobe coordinate system ( projection on a cube ) and to integrate the 2mass maps on each dirbe pixel .",
    "however , since the 2mass data still contain coverage holes , we kept only those that are completely covered by 2mass .",
    "the effective useful region covers finally about 1400  deg@xmath5 ( fig .",
    "[ integj ] ) .      in the remaining 1400  deg@xmath5 piece of sky , @xmath39% of pixels",
    "are contaminated by bright stars .",
    "stars bright enough to be detected as point sources in dirbe are saturated in 2mass .",
    "consequently their photometry can not be derived from 2mass to be subtracted from dirbe .",
    "moreover , the dirbe beam has a size of @xmath26 , but the sampling of the data is @xmath40 .",
    "several pixels are therefore contaminated by a bright star , and this contamination depends on the star position in the beam . to identify pixels affected by these stars we use a median filter which deals with the 2mass holes .",
    "a pixel is considered as contaminated if it is brighter than the threshold , @xmath41 , defined by the median plus @xmath42 , @xmath43 , of the surrounding pixels in a @xmath44 radius circle of the dirbe@xmath452mass map : @xmath46 pixels fainter than @xmath47 are also removed to avoid bias . in order to validate this operation , we use the 2mass bright infrared star compilation ( tam et al .",
    "1999 ) which contains photometry for stars as bright as @xmath48 mag in @xmath49 .",
    "this compilation consists of data taken from the literature and photometry extrapolations from iras , msx or 2mass . among the 343 stars brighter than @xmath50 mag in our regions of interest ,",
    "11 are not identified with the median filter ( eq.[eq_med ] ) .",
    "however , these remaining contaminated pixels are rejected by the robust linear fitting of dirbe/2mass brightness ( see fig .",
    "[ pointjk ] ) .    after removing bright stars ,",
    "1040  deg@xmath5 of the sky remain .",
    "the 2mass integrated brightness maps were limited to the formal completeness limits of 2mass ( @xmath51  mag , @xmath52  mag ) .",
    "a model is required to estimate the contribution of the fainter stellar population with respect to the position in the sky .",
    "we use a model in which the number and distribution of milky way stars as seen in the near to mid - infrared is adapted from the @xcite optical star count model .",
    "we have employed the discrete population formalism of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the model includes the class iii ( evolved giant ) , class iv ( subdwarfs ) and class v ( main sequence ) stellar populations .",
    "these are further divided into disk and spheroid spatial distributions ( ala bahcall & soneira ) .",
    "the stars are discretely binned according to their spectral types , ranging from the hottest o stars to the coolest m dwarfs , giving a total of 22 separate spectral bins for the main sequence , and 12 for the luminous giants ( ranging from g2 to m7 giant ) .",
    "the optical / infrared colors , fluxes and luminosity function per spectral type are based on empirical data ( e.g. , koornneef 1983 ; 2mass , iso and iras ) .",
    "interstellar extinction is applied as a smooth exponential function of galactic position , characterized by a scale height and disk length .",
    "the model parameters were tuned using deep optical and infrared star counts .",
    "the resultant model was validated using the 2mass survey down to @xmath53 and @xmath54  mag ( @xmath55  mjy ) .",
    "the result of the model for a typical high galactic latitude field ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 ) is presented in figure  [ cmodel ] . as expected ,",
    "2mass counts are complete at least to @xmath58  mag . according to the model , less than 3% ( 0.1% ) of the total stellar energy",
    "is contained in stars fainter than @xmath59 ( 19 ) .",
    "the model is useful for magnitudes ranging from 14.3 to @xmath60 in @xmath19 . assuming a conservative number density uncertainty of a factor of 2 for these faint magnitudes",
    ", the resulting error will not exceed 3% of the total stellar flux .",
    "we choose 4 areas with a radius of @xmath61 in order to illustrate the correlation between dirbe and 2mass .",
    "pixels contaminated by bright stars have been filtered .",
    "figure  [ pointjk ] show the correlations for @xmath1 and @xmath3 bands .",
    "the main characteristics for each region are summarized in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "we note that slopes are not exactly 1 ( @xmath62 for @xmath1 , @xmath63 for @xmath3 ) .",
    "this arises from the different calibration strategy used by dirbe and 2mass : dirbe is calibrated with sirius , 2mass with a list of calibration stars of many different spectral types @xcite .",
    "these calibration differences affect only the slope of the dirbe/2mass relation , not the value of the intercept which is the measure of the cib .",

    ". theoretical uncertainties in the zodiacal light model are further discussed by @xcite .",
    "statistical uncertainties that comes from the dirbe/2mass correlation and from the zodiacal light can be estimated directly from figure  [ eclip ] by measuring the root mean square deviation of the distribution .",

    "a summary of the different uncertainty contributions is presented in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "the presence of fluctuations in the residual sky brightness , especially in @xmath1 , suggests a small contribution to the sky brightness by starlight scattered off of interstellar dust grains .",
    "interstellar dust passing through the solar system will scatter and reemit absorbed sunlight .",
    "the volume within which sunlight is significant ( compared to the interstellar radiation field [ isrf ] ) is smaller than the size of the solar system itself : at visible wavelengths , sunlight exceeds the isrf out to the oort cloud ( @xmath94  au ) , while at far - ultraviolet wavelengths , sunlight exceeds the isrf only out to 800  au ( at 0.2 @xmath2 m ) or less . the amount of interstellar dust close to the sun was recently measured by the ulysses and galileo spaceprobes @xcite ; the volumetric cross - section is @xmath95  @xmath96  @xmath97 .",
    "it was found that the size distribution is deficient in small particles relative to the interstellar size distribution , such that the surface area is dominated by particles with size @xmath98 @xmath2 m .    to estimate the brightness of sunlight scattered by local interstellar dust",
    ", we assume the particles detected by ulysses are spread uniformly throughout the solar system .",
    "the emission from dust in the inner solar system will have a detectable dependence on solar elongation angle , and would have been included in the dirbe zodiacal emission model @xcite .",
    "therefore , we integrate from 3  au outward in calculating the brightness of sunlight scattered by interstellar dust and potentially contributing to an isotropic background .",
    "the brightness is @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the albedo , @xmath101 is the solar intensity , and @xmath102 is the scattering phase function . using the properties of a mixture of astronomical silicates and graphite @xcite , the albedo in the @xmath1 and @xmath3 bands is 0.42 and 0.21 , respectively .",
    "for the phase function , we used a henyey - greenstein function with the asymmetry factor appropriate for the same mixture of astronomical silicates and graphite ( @xmath103 , @xmath104 ) .",
    "the resulting brightness is @xmath105 and @xmath106  kjy  sr@xmath7 in the @xmath1 and @xmath3 bands , respectively .",
    "uncertainty in the estimate of the brightness of the local interstellar dust is due to three sources .",
    "first , our lack of accurate knowledge of the composition of the interstellar grains leads to a factor of approximately 2 uncertainty in their albedo ; this estimate is based on the difference between the albedos of silicate and graphite grains @xcite .",
    "second , the lack of precise distinction between the emission that would be effectively isotropic and that which would be incorporated into the zodiacal light model leads to a @xmath60  % uncertainty ; this is based on changing the minimum integration distance from 3 to 2.5  au .",
    "third , smaller particles that are not detected by ulysses may be present at larger distances from the sun ; these particles are likely to be produce an insignificant scattering because of the weakness of sunlight at large distances from the sun .",

    "although galaxies appear to be unable to explain the brightness of the cosmic background , there are other possible sources of energy production that could lead to an isotropic cosmic background in the near - infrared . an early burst of star formation inside or outside of galaxies , ( that is , either in primeval galaxies or in population iii stars ) , would result in a nearly uniform and isotropic background @xcite .",
    "the photospheric emission from these stars would be redshifted into the infrared . for @xmath162 ,",

    "the present abundance of heavy elements limits the amount of early star formation such that population iii stars are not likely to be a very significant mass contribution to the universe as a whole @xcite , but the amount of star formation required to explain the near - infrared cosmic background does not violate metallicity constraints .",
    "the implications of such early star formation , for the small - scale density fluctuations of primordial matter and for the nature of the intergalactic medium , would be significant .    depending on the power spectrum of small - scale density fluctuations , a population of black holes could form before galaxies .",
    "the accretion of surrounding material by these holes would generate energy that would make an isotropic background today .",
    "the temperature of the accretion disk would be @xmath163 k , and the accretion luminosity would be redshifted into the near - infrared if the accretion is active at @xmath16450 @xcite .",
    "our observed @xmath1 band background brightness , after subtracting the integrated light from galaxies , could be explained by the accretion luminosity of a population of black holes .",
    "such black holes would not comprise enough dark matter to close the universe , and their total mass would not violate constraints on the total baryon density inferred from models of primordial nucleosynthesis .",
    "but such a large population of objects ( comparable to the total mass of galaxies ) would contribute significantly to the total inventory of baryons .    massive particles that survive until redshift @xmath165 and subsequently decay into photons will produce a background of decay photons that is subsequently redshifted @xcite .",
    "for example , part of the @xmath1 and @xmath3 band background could be produced by the decay of relic 100  ev neutrinos at redshift @xmath166 .",
    "the number of plausible models is very large , and we can only speculate whether the background is due to such decaying particles .",
    "the integration of the 2mass catalog over 550  deg@xmath5 ( i.e. @xmath167 dirbe pixels ) leads to an estimate of the cib for @xmath1 and @xmath3 of @xmath6  kjy  sr@xmath7 ( @xmath8  nw  m@xmath9  sr@xmath7 ) and @xmath10  kjy  sr@xmath7 ( @xmath11  nw  m@xmath9  sr@xmath7 ) , respectively .",
    "we have selected the most reliable areas of the sky by eliminating pixels contaminated by bright stars , low galactic latitude regions , low ecliptic latitude regions and possible cirrus clouds contribution .",
    "a study of dirbe@xmath452mass versus ecliptic latitude clearly shows that the zodiacal light is responsible of most of the statistical uncertainty ( @xmath55  kjy  sr@xmath7 ) .",
    "the interplanetary dust model contains a systematic error which is actually the dominant uncertainty in our results ( @xmath168  kjy  sr@xmath7 ) .",
    "the integrated brightness of known galaxies ( down to the 30@xmath169 magnitude ) represents only a fraction of the cib .",
    "although the uncertainties due to residual contribution of the zodiacal light are significant , the discrepancy between dirbe@xmath452mass and galaxy counts would suggest that a significant part of the energy is still not observed in discrete sources .",
    "the slope of the galaxy luminosity functions may increase for galaxies fainter than the 30@xmath169 magnitude , in which case the counts would agree with the cib values .",
    "however , models predict other possible contributions to the background at these wavelengths @xcite such as a burst of star formation either in primeval galaxies or in population iii stars ( @xmath170 ) , very massive black holes ( accreting from an uniform pre - galactic medium at @xmath171 ) , massive decaying big bang relic particles ( @xmath172 ) .",
    "we have put new constraints in the near - infrared that encourage revisiting the importance of those contributions to the cib in cosmological models .",
    "the space infrared telescope facility ( sirtf ) may extend this result for the @xmath16 band at 3.5  @xmath2 m and might be able to constrain the contributions of the different components to the background .",
    "the final all - sky 2mass catalogs will permit a more accurate study of the near - infrared excess : 100% of the sky will be still available after integration on the dirbe beam , @xmath173 after bright star removal ( only 18% for the 2mass 2@xmath174 release presently used ) and about 5000  deg@xmath5 will remain at high galactic and ecliptic latitudes .",
    "this coverage should allow us to investigate structures in the zodiacal light and may help to improve interplanetary dust models .",
