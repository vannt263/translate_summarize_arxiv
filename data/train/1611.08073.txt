    "it is well known , especially in the field of condensed matter physics , a correspondence between some topological invariant for a gapped hamiltonian of an infinite system without edge and some topological invariant for a hamiltonian of a system with edge , which appeared in the theoretical study of the quantum hall effect . in @xmath1 , k. von klitzing",
    ", g. dorda and m. pepper discovered a quantization of the hall conductance of a two - dimensional electron gas in a strong magnetic field @xcite .",
    "such quantization of the hall conductance was explained by d. j. thouless , m. kohmoto , m. p. nightingale and m. den nijs from the topological point of view @xcite .",
    "they showed that the hall conductance in the infinite system corresponds to a first chern number ( called the tknn number ) of the bloch bundle on the brillouin torus , by using the kubo formula .",
    "y. hatsugai considered such phenomena on a system with edge , and showed that the hall conductance of such system corresponds to a winding number ( or a spectral flow ) counted on a riemann surface @xcite .",
    "these correspondences of hall conductances with integer valued topological invariants explain the quantization and the robustness of the observed hall conductance .",
    "the equality between the first chern number defined for such system without edge ( called the _ bulk index _ ) and the winding number defined for such system with edge ( called the _ edge index _ ) was proved by hatsugai @xcite .",
    "this is called the _ bulk - edge correspondence_.    g. m. graf and m. porta proved the bulk - edge correspondence in @xcite by using another vector bundle .",
    "they defined a vector bundle over some torus for a system without edge by using ( formal ) solutions of the hamiltonian which decays as it goes to a specific direction .",
    "this vector bundle is closely related to the winding number defined for a system with edge , and by using this bundle , they showed the bulk - edge correspondence for quantum spin hall systems , which was pointed out by c. l. kane and e. j. mele @xcite , and also for quantum hall systems .",
    "they defined such vector bundles by using the solvability of some second - order difference equation by an initial condition , and so they need to assume some invertibility conditions for hopping matrices of the hamiltonian to ensure such solvability .",
    "they also assumed that the band would be non - degenerated by some technical reasons . note that such vector bundles consist of decaying solutions",
    "were also considered in @xcite .",
    "graf and porta gave in @xcite another proof of the bulk - edge correspondence for quantum hall systems based on levinson s theorem in scattering theory .",
    "this point of view is not treated in this paper .    in this paper",
    ", we develop graf ",
    "porta s proof of the bulk - edge correspondence to use another vector bundle , from the point of view of @xmath0-theory and index theory .",
    "we give a proof of the bulk - edge correspondence for some two - dimensional type a topological insulators and topological superconductors in the altland - zirnbauer classification @xcite , based on the cobordism invariance of the indices .",
    "we see that graf  porta s vector bundle can be understood as a family index ( more precisely , kernels ) of some family of fredholm operators , and define such bundles for hamiltonians not necessarily have such invertibility conditions . in this way , we do not need to use the solvability of some second order difference equation by an initial condition , nor to assume the non - degeneracy of the band .",
    "the proof goes as follows .",
    "we first construct two elements of some compactly supported @xmath0-groups , and see that they map to , by inverse of thom isomorphisms , the @xmath0-class of the bloch bundle , and the @xmath0-class of the difference of the class of graf  porta s vector bundle and that of a trivial bundle , respectively .",
    "we then construct a cobordism between them . by using the cobordism invariance of the index ,",
    "we obtain an equality between the bulk index and the first chern number of graf ",
    "porta s vector bundle .",
    "we next show the equality between graf ",
    "porta s index and the edge index by using the excision property of the index .",
    "there are many other works about the bulk - edge correspondence , especially form the point of view of @xmath0-theory and index theory .",
    "starting from the pioneering work of j. bellissard , an approach from the point of view of the noncommutative geometry was developed , and the bulk - edge correspondence was proved by kellendonk ",
    "schulz - baldes , by using the six - term exact sequence for @xmath0-theory of @xmath2-algebras @xcite .",
    "simon considered an index theorem for a pair of projections in this context @xcite , and elbau  graf proved the bulk - edge correspondence by generalizing their method @xcite .",

    "carey  rennie to use the kasparov theory @xcite , by mathai ",
    "thiang to use the t - duality @xcite , by y. kubota to use the coarse mayer - vietoris exact sequence @xcite .",
    "although we use @xmath0-theory and index theory to prove the bulk - edge correspondence , the proof presented here is different from these methods and rather elementary .",
    "what we need is just basics of topological @xmath0-theory and index theory .",
    "the technique in the elementary proof of the bott periodicity theorem by m. f. atiyah and r. bott @xcite is used to calculate the family index .",

    "note also that @xmath0-theory is also used in the classification of topological phases @xcite .",

    "actually we can also prove the bulk - edge correspondence for such systems almost in the same way as presented in this paper , by using @xmath3-theory introduced by j. l. dupont @xcite .",
    "the proof of the bott periodicity theorem for such theory was given in @xcite .",
    "since the proof goes in the same way , we decided not to contain this case and consider just quantum hall systems , in order to make this paper appropriate length to introduce our idea .",

    "[ sec:6 ] , since the cobordism invariance of the index is the key to prove the bulk - edge correspondence , a simple proof of this property by using the whitney embedding theorem and the bott periodicity is contained .",
