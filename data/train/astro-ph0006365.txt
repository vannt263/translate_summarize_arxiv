    "the mid - infrared spectrum of herbig ae / be stars is rich in information that can be used to improve our understanding of the circumstellar environment .",
    "the wavelength interval between 6 and 13 @xmath2 m contains most of the infrared emission bands ( ieb ) , as well as the broad silicate feature centered at about 9.7 @xmath2 m .    from ground - based and kao spectroscopy ( roche et al .",
    "1991 , schutte et al .",
    "1990 ) it is known that ieb exist in the spectra of some herbig ae / be stars .",
    "a large number of herbig ae / be stars have been measured with the infrared space observatory ( iso ) .",
    "the iso sample will allow us to determine the properties and nature of the ieb carriers with unprecedented accuracy ( waelkens et al .",
    "these data will be crucial in solving the puzzle of the mid - infrared energetics of herbig ae / be stars , by determining to what extent ieb emission contributes to the observed mid - infrared luminosity , and how much ir emission comes from a circumstellar disk in herbig stars of different spectral type and age ( kenyon & hartmann 1991 , hillenbrand et al .",
    "1992 , natta et al .",
    "1993 ) .    a very important contribution to our understanding of the ieb and of their role in herbig ae / be stars is provided by spatial information on the extension and distribution of the emission at various wavelengths . for example , prusti et al .",
    "( 1994 ) were able to infer the presence of infrared emission bands ( ieb ) and to determine some of the properties of the distribution of the carriers around herbig ae / be stars from multi  aperture photometry in the three narrow - band filters n1 , n2 and n3 . natta & krgel ( 1995 ) , using the radiation transfer code developed by siebenmorgen et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , computed the expected intensity profile in the ieb and in the adjacent continuum as a function of the spectral type of the exciting star and of the surrounding shell parameters .",
    "however , until recently the scarcity of observed intensity profiles has greatly limited the usefulness of these calculations .",
    "spectro - photometric imaging observations using the circular variable filters ( cvf ) of isocam ( cesarsky et al .",
    "1996 ) are capable of producing the spatial information we want .",
    "in addition to the determination of the source size at the various wavelengths , they can also reveal additional emission structures and deviations from spherical symmetry .",
    "we present in this paper the results of isocam spectro  photometric , isopht ( lemke et al . 1996 ) multi  aperture and isosws ( de graauw et al . 1996 ) grating scan observations of a small sample of herbig ae / be stars that we consider particularly suited to this purpose .",
    "our sample includes 5 stars of spectral type b9/a0 ( hd  179218 , hd  176386 , ty  cra , hd  97048 and hd  97300 ) .",
    "they cover a small age interval , from 1 myr to @xmath3 myr ( table 1 ) . some of these stars ( i.e. , ty  cra and hd  97048 ) are known to have strong ieb features ( roche et al .",
    "1991 , deutsch et al .",
    "in addition , prusti et al .",
    "( 1994 ) could infer from multi  aperture study the presence of ieb for hd176393 , hd97048 and hd  97300 .",
    "in addition to these 5 stars , we have included in our sample two stars of later spectral type , namely hr  5999 ( spectral type a5/7 ) and t  cha ( spectral type g8 ) .",
    "the aim was to check the dependence of ieb band shapes and intensity profiles on the spectral type of the exciting star .",
    "ground - based observations in the 10 @xmath2 m region ( wooden 1994 ) seem to indicate that , as expected , ieb are weak or absent in herbig ae / be stars of later spectral type ( see also the 3.3 @xmath2 m survey of brooke et al .",
    "much more surprisingly , it was also found that the silicate feature appears in emission only in stars of later spectral types .",
    "there is no obvious reason why silicate emission should disappear in hotter stars .",
    "its absence is probably due to the geometrical distribution of the dust around the star .",
    "if we believe that the silicate emission is linked to the existence of a circumstellar disk ( chiang & goldreich 1997 ) , it is possible that early - type stars do not show the silicate feature because they do not have disks .",
    "this would confirm the results obtained with millimeter interferometry , namely that herbig stars of spectral type a show evidence of disks while very few herbig b stars do ( di francesco et al .",
    "it is possible that silicate emission disappears in b stars as they age , dissipating their disks and pushing farther away the residual envelopes . the discovery of `` transitional '' objects , showing both ieb and silicate emission would be very interesting in this context .",
    "a convincing answer to these questions requires a statistical ( i.e. large ) sample of spectra and intensity maps for herbig ae / be stars of different spectral type and age",
    ". however , we feel that our results can provide interesting clues to a possible answer .",

    "the results for the individual stars are presented and discussed in sect .",
    "a summary is given in sect .",
    "spectro - photometric images have been obtained with isocam for the stars in our sample in a number of cvf wavelength intervals , selected to probe the emission in ieb at 6.2 ,  7.7  , 8.6 and 11.3@xmath2 m .",
