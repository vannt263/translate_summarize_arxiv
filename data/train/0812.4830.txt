    "such cpv effect could be tested in the decays of the pseudoscalar mesons by measuring the polarization of the virtual photon and would result in an asymmetry in the angle @xmath3 between the planes containing the @xmath11 and the @xmath20 pairs in the meson rest frame , defined as : @xmath21 . this kind of asymmetry has been already studied @xcite and observed @xcite in the decay of the @xmath22 meson . in the @xmath4 decay",
