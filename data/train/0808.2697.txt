    "the adiabatic approximation , with its long history @xcite , has played a central role in quantum mechanics .",
    "this approximation states , roughly , that for a system initially prepared in an eigenstate ( e.g. , the ground state ) @xmath0 of a sufficiently slowly varying hamiltonian @xmath1 , the time evolution governed by the schrdinger equation @xmath2 will approximately keep the actual state @xmath3 of the system in the corresponding instantaneous ground state @xmath4 of @xmath1 , provided that there are no level crossings . quantitative statements of this approximation have a long history , with rigorous results appearing only in recent years .",

    "namely , the fidelity between the actual final state and the adiabatic eigenstate satisfies @xmath10 , where @xmath11 $ ] .",
    "unfortunately this simple criterion  while often useful , and widely used ( e.g. , in refs .",
    "farhi:00,farhi:01,roland:02 )  is in fact neither necessary nor sufficient in general , as recently confirmed experimentally @xcite .",
    "the inadequacy of the traditional criterion is well known and the criterion has been replaced by rigorous general results as can be found , e.g. , in refs .",
    "teufel : book , nenciu:93,avron:99,hagedorn:02,jansen:06 , and in the presence of noise , in ref .",
    "all these rigorous results are more severe in the gap condition than the traditional criterion , and they involve a power of the _ norm _ of time derivatives of the hamiltonian , rather than a transition matrix element . in this work",
    "we revisit the adiabatic approximation and prove a version of the adiabatic theorem that is motivated by recent developments in the field of quantum information science nielsen : book , namely the idea of adiabatic quantum computation ( aqc ) farhi:00,farhi:01 .",
    "aqc offers a fascinating paradigm for exploiting quantum mechanics in order to obtain a speedup for classically difficult computational problems . in aqc one",
    "solves a computational problem by adiabatically modifying a hamiltonian whose initial ground state @xmath0 encodes the input and whose final ground state @xmath12 encodes the output . the time @xmath13 taken to reach the final ground state is the running time  of the quantum adiabatic algorithm , which one would like to minimize while at the same time minimizing the distance @xmath14 between the actual final state @xmath15 and the desired final ground state @xmath12 .",
    "this , of course , is the subject of the quantum adiabatic theorem , and provides the motivation for the present paper . in quantum computation",
    "one is interested in how @xmath13 scales with problem size , which is typically encoded into the system size needed to represent the problem , e.g. , the number @xmath16 of quantum bits ( qubits ) .",
    "thus one expects both @xmath13 and @xmath14 to scale with @xmath16 .",
    "our goal is two - fold .",
    "first , to determine the scaling properties of @xmath13 and @xmath17 with @xmath16 .",
    "second , to show that @xmath17 can be made exponentially small in @xmath13 .",
    "aqc  was first proposed as an approach to solving optimization problems such as satisfiability of boolean formulas , by encoding a cost function into the hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "however , it was soon realized that aqc  is not limited to optimization :  from a computational complexity perspective aqc is equivalent in power to all other models for universal quantum computation @xcite .",
    "namely , aqc  and the other models for universal quantum computation can simulate one another with at most polynomial resource overhead .",
    "one of the reasons aqc  has generated much interest recently is that it has a rich connection to well studied problems in condensed matter physics .",
    "for example , because of the dependence of @xmath13 on the minimal gap , the performance of quantum adiabatic algorithms is strongly influenced by the type of quantum phase transition the same system would undergo in the thermodynamic limit @xcite , thus offering an interesting perspective on the connection between quantum information methods and problems in condensed matter physics .",
    "aqc also appears to offer advantages over classical simulated annealing in finding an approximate ground state energy of a complex system @xcite .",
    "to date , most aqc studies have relied on the traditional version of the adiabatic approximation .",
    "the main question we wish to address in this work is : what is the rigorous tradeoff between a small final error @xmath14 and the scaling of the final time @xmath13 with system size @xmath16 , or any other relevant parameter ?",
    "the reason one expects a dependence on @xmath16 is clear from the traditional criterion :  the gap @xmath18 and @xmath19 both depend on @xmath16 .",
    "it has been known for some years in the mathematical physics literature that exponential accuracy in the form @xmath20 ( @xmath21 is some constant ) is possible nenciu:93,hagedorn:02 , but the cost in terms of physical resources such as system size @xmath16 has thus far not been quantified in rigorous proofs of the adiabatic theorem , even those specifically aimed at aqc jansen:06,ohara:042319 .",
    "however , in aqc an understanding of the scaling of the running time with respect to problem size is of paramount importance .",
    "it is further important to stress that in aqc  one deals with designer hamiltonians , which contain controllable parameters beyond what is typically assumed in developments of the adiabatic approximation or proofs of the adiabatic theorem .",
    "that is , one envisions any number of control knobswhich allow one to realize the goal of transforming the initial to the final hamiltonian . here",
    "we prove a version of the adiabatic theorem which focuses on one such control knob : the number @xmath22 of vanishing initial and final time derivatives of the hamiltonian .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the hamiltonian satisfies certain analyticity properties .",
    "our theorem states , roughly , that for such hamiltonians , the deviation between the final state and the desired ( non - degenerate ) adiabatic eigenstate can be made exponentially small in @xmath22 , with a running time that scales as as a polynomial in @xmath22 times the square of the supremum of the norm of the time derivative of the hamiltonian , divided by the cube of the minimal gap . since the scaling of @xmath23 and of the gap @xmath18 can be quantified in terms of the system size @xmath16 for situations of interest in aqc ( see section [ sec : norm - bounds ] ) , this provides an answer to the scaling question we posed above , and our result should be particularly useful for aqc  applications . in proving this result",
    "we rely on the adiabatic exponential error estimate and asymptotic expansion due to hagedorn and joye @xcite .",
    "the structure of this paper is the following .",
    "we begin by stating our notation , definitions , and technical assumptions in section [ sec : prelim ] , and conclude this section with a statement of our version of the adiabatic theorem , including some remarks . before proving this theorem",
    ", we provide pertinent background in section [ sec : background ] , including a brief summary of key results from ref .",

    "we provide a discussion in section sec : discussion , including a comparison of our version of the adiabatic theorem to some of the results of refs .  @xcite . in the same section",
    "we also analyze the scaling of the running time and error with system size , give an explicit result ( corollary [ cor:2qpt ] ) for second order quantum phase transitions , find the minimum adiabatic time @xmath13 by optimizing the adiabatic interpolation and give an application of our adiabatic theorem in the open system setting ( theorem  [ th : full - open ] ) .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : conc ] with some remarks about future directions .",

    "if one does not know the final time @xmath13 exactly , one can still attempt to compute an estimate @xmath430 for @xmath13 , and set the final - time derivatives of the hamiltonian equal to zero at @xmath430 . provided @xmath431 , stretching the adiabatic evolution in such a manner can not result in a worse error than promised by theorem  [ th:1 ] for @xmath13 .",
    "second , in the context of aqc one would like to measure the final state , in order to extract the answer to the computation .",
    "for this reason it makes sense to simply make the hamiltonian constant for @xmath432 starting from a value slightly smaller than @xmath13  which implies that the derivatives of the hamiltonian at the final time @xmath13 vanish .",
    "this , of course , automatically satisfies the requirement of vanishing final - time derivatives .",
    "one can not make the same argument about initialization of the computation , however : initialization is a dynamic process ( e.g. , cooling into the ground state ) , so that one can not keep the hamiltonian constant for all @xmath433 .",

    "this is a reasonable physical assumption in many cases @xcite .",
    "coupling of the system to the bath introduces decoherence , and modifies the adiabatic condition relative to the closed system case we have discussed thus far @xcite .",

    "a useful fact is that taking the partial trace can only decrease the distance between states @xcite , i.e. , if @xmath451 and @xmath450 are states in the joint system - bath hilbert space @xmath452 , then @xmath453\\leq d[\\rho _ { 1},\\rho _ { 2 } ] ,   \\label{dtrb}\\]]where @xmath454 is the partial trace operation over the bath hilbert space : @xmath455\\equiv \\langle b^{\\prime } |b\\rangle |s\\rangle \\langle s^{\\prime } |$ ] , for arbitrary states @xmath456 and @xmath457 .",
    "inequality ( [ dtrb ] ) can be understood intuitively as a consequence of the fact that by erasing information ( taking the partial trace ) one can not make states more distinguishable , i.e. , their distance can not increase .",

    "[ gap ] for the isolated system .",
    "this means that @xmath13 can be expected to be very much larger in the open system case than for the same system without coupling to a bath .",

    "@xcite for a different approach leading to the same conclusion .",
    "in this work we aimed to bridge a gap between rigorous formulations of the quantum adiabatic theorem , leading to exponentially tight error estimates , and the field of adiabatic quantum computation ( aqc ) , where knowledge of the way the energy gap enters the conditions for the adiabatic approximation is crucial . to this end",
    "we have presented a version of the quantum adiabatic approximation that is useful for aqc , where there is a single non - degenerate ground state , the number of subsystems @xmath16 is variable , and where the interpolation from the initial to the final hamiltonian is fully controllable , at least in principle . in this case , we have shown that for a total time @xmath13 scaling as the product of the cube of the inverse gap and the square of the operator norm of @xmath473 , the error in the adiabatic approximation can be made exponentially small . since our version of the quantum adiabatic theorem explicitly accounts for the system size dependence ( see , e.g. , corollary [ cor:2qpt ] ) , this represents an advance over previous adiabatic theorems , where either the approximation error or the system - size dependence is not nailed down .",
    "our results imply that as long as our key assumption of analyticity of the interpolation in a domain can be satisfied , along with a degree of control that allows setting the initial and final time derivatives of the hamiltonian equal to zero , then from a closed - system perspective aqc has an important fault tolerance advantage over the circuit model of quantum computation @xcite .",
    "namely , whereas in the circuit model even unitary deviations from a prescribed set of gates can ruin a quantum algorithm , in aqc large deviations are permissible , as long as the interpolation ends at the desired final hamiltonian , whose ground state encodes the answer to the computational problem one is trying to solve . of course",
    ", this should not be misinterpreted as a claim that aqc is fully fault tolerant .",
    "it is well known that aqc is vulnerable to interactions with the environment sarandylidar:05,childs:01,rolandcerf:04,ashhab:052330,tiersch:07,amin:07 , and only preliminary steps have been taken towards a theory of fault tolerant aqc in an open systems setting @xcite .",
    "we have also reported a corollary regarding the adiabatic theorem for open quantum systems ( theorem  [ th : full - open ] ) , which shows that the time - scale for adiabaticity is determined by the gap of the full system - bath hamiltonian .",
    "there are indications that the adiabatic approximation fails for hamiltonians with several independent time - scales @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "this presents an interesting problem for aqc , even in our setting of a closed system with analytic hamiltonians .",
    "for example , consider a situation where there is some smooth control noise on the interpolation functions @xmath474 , which has an independent time - scale .",
    "then merely slowing down the evolution by elongating @xmath13 will have no impact on this noise , so that in its presence the time dilation - based error bound ( [ del - val ] ) can not be expected to apply . in other words ,",
    "noise with an intrinsic time scale that can not be stretched in the sense that makes @xmath156 in the asymptotic expansion ( [ 2.15 ] ) small , generates a violation of the assumptions used to derive the adiabatic theorem .",
