    "recently we have introduced a method for incorporating an external electromagnetic field into any model of hadrons whose strong interactions are described through the solution of integral equations @xcite .",
    "the method involves the gauging of the integral equations themselves , and results in electromagnetic amplitudes where an external photon is coupled to every part of every strong interaction diagram in the model .",
    "current conservation is therefore implemented in the theoretically correct fashion .",
    "initially we applied our gauging procedure to the covariant three - nucleon problem whose strong interactions are described by standard four - dimensional three - body integral equations @xcite .",
    "more recently we used the same method to gauge the three - dimensional spectator equation for a system of three - nucleons @xcite .    here",
    "we apply our gauging procedure to the more complicated case of the covariant @xmath0  system whose four - dimensional integral equations have only recently been derived @xcite . in this way",
    "we obtain gauge invariant expressions for all possible electromagnetic processes of the @xmath0  system , e.g. pion photoproduction @xmath4 , pion electroproduction @xmath5 , and because pion absorption is taken into account explicitly , we also obtain gauge invariant expressions for processes like deuteron photodisintegration @xmath6 and bremsstrahlung @xmath7 that are valid even at energies above pion production threshold .",
    "included in the electromagnetic processes described by our model is the especially interesting case of elastic electron - deuteron scattering . here",
    "the deuteron is described as a bound state of our full @xmath0model ; thus , after gauging , we obtain a rich description of the electromagnetic form factors of the deuteron with all possible meson exchange currents taken into account .",
    "since the early 1960 s many attempts have been made to formulate few - body equations for @xmath0-like systems using relativistic quantum field theory @xcite . yet",
    "all these attempts have had theoretical inconsistencies with perturbation diagrams being either overcounted or undercounted .",
    "the first consistent @xmath0  equations were derived by us only recently @xcite and have the feature of containing explicit subtraction terms in the kernels of the equations that eliminate all overcounting . at the same time",
    "the undercounting problem is eliminated by the retention of certain three - body forces .",
    "the same @xmath0  equations were later derived by phillips and afnan  @xcite using a different method . in this section",
    "we would simply like to restate these equations but in a form that is particularly convenient for gauging .",
    "it is easy to rearrange the four - dimensional @xmath0  equations of ref .  5 into a convenient form similar to the one used by afnan and blankleider  @xcite in a three - dimensional formulation of the @xmath0  system .",
    "for the distinguishable nucleon case we obtain t^d = v^d + v^d g_t^d t^d [ bs^d ] where @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are @xmath11 matrices given by t^d= (    cc t^d_nn & |t^d_n + t^d_n & t^d    ) ; v^d= (    cc v^d_nn & |f^d + f^d & g_0 ^ -1    ) ; g_t^d= (    cc d_0 & 0 + 0 & g_0 w^0 g_0    ) .",
