    "successful functioning of biological cells strongly depends on two classes of enzyme molecules , motor proteins and cytoskeleton proteins , that form the basis of the biological transport systems.@xcite motor proteins such as kinesins , dyneins , myosins , rna and dna polymerases , etc .",
    ", operate in cells by transforming the chemical energy of hydrolysis of atp ( or related compounds ) into the mechanical work , although the mechanism of this process is still largely unknown.@xcite the cytoskeleton proteins , such as microtubules and actin filaments , are rigid multifilament linear polymers that provide tracks for the motion of motor proteins.@xcite the growth dynamics of these proteins strongly influences their biological functions.@xcite one of the most striking properties of growing cytoskeleton proteins is the dynamic instability phenomena that observed both _ in vitro _ and _ in vivo _ in the microtubules@xcite and in parm proteins,@xcite closely related homologs of the actin filaments .",
    "recent experimental advances have allowed to determine the dynamics of motor proteins and the growth of cytoskeleton proteins with a single - molecule precision at different conditions.@xcite these experiments suggest that the complex biochemical transitions and intermediate states in the motor proteins and cytoskeleton proteins influence their dynamic properties and functions . in order to understand biophysical properties of these proteins all biochemical pathways and transitions",
    "should be taken into account .",
    "one of the most successful approaches to describe the dynamics of motor proteins and growth of cytoskeleton proteins is a method of multi - state discrete chemical kinetic or stochastic models.@xcite according to this approach , the motor protein molecule or the tip of the cytoskeleton filament moves between discrete biochemical states , and these transitions are governed by a set of stochastic rates .",
    "these biochemical pathways are periodic due to the periodicity in the structure of the cytoskeleton proteins .",
    "this method allows to obtain exact analytic expressions for the dynamic properties , such as mean velocity @xmath1 and dispersion @xmath2 , in terms of the transition rates for systems with arbitrary number of states in the periods.@xcite another advantage of the discrete stochastic models is the ability to describe the complexity of the underlying biochemical pathways , something that can not be done by other theoretical methods.@xcite currently , discrete stochastic models are developed , analyzed and applied for the simple sequential single - chain pathways@xcite , for the biochemical pathways with irreversible detachments@xcite , for the lattices with branched states,@xcite for the parallel - chain pathways,@xcite and for the systems with general waiting - time distributions for transitions between the states.@xcite    in order to describe better the complex biological transport processes , in this work we extend the discrete chemical kinetic approach by considering a two - chain model with a direct coupling between parallel lattices at each site , as illustrated in fig .",
    "1 . there are total @xmath6 sites in each period of the system , equally divided between the chains .",
    "each site corresponds to a specific biochemical state of the the motor protein or the cytoskeleton protein .",
    "the protein molecule can be found on the upper biochemical pathway ( chain 0 ) or it can move along the lower pathway ( chain 1 ) : see fig .",
    "1 . the particle at state @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) on the chain 0 can make a forward step with the rate @xmath9 and a backward step with the rate @xmath10  see fig .",
    "1 . it also can make a vertical transition to the state @xmath7 on the chain 1 with the rate @xmath11 .",
    "similarly , the particle at state @xmath7 on the chain 1 can diffuse forward ( backward ) with the rate @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) , while the transition to the upper channel is given by the rate @xmath14 , as shown in fig .",
    "the distance between identical states in different periods is equal to @xmath15 .",
    "this model can be used , for example , to analyze the dynamics of rna polymerases@xcite or it can describe the dynamic instability of microtubules and parm proteins.@xcite    our analysis of the periodic coupled parallel - chain discrete stochastic models is based on the derrida s method@xcite that allows to obtain explicit analytic expressions for the stationary - state drift velocity @xmath16 and dispersion ( or diffusion constant ) @xmath17,\\ ] ] where @xmath18 represents the spatial coordinate of the motor protein or of the tip of the cytoskeleton protein .    the paper is organized as follows . the results for discrete parallel - chain models in the limit of strong coupling between the pathways are outlined in section ii , while general explicit formulas for dynamic properties for @xmath3 and @xmath4 models are discussed in section iii . section iv summarizes and concludes are analysis .",
    "the details of mathematical calculations are given in appendix .",
    "consider the general periodic coupled two - chain discrete stochastic model as shown in fig .",
    "1 . let us define @xmath19 and @xmath20 as probability density currents between the states @xmath7 and @xmath21 in the channel 0 and 1 , correspondingly .",
    "also @xmath22 is a vertical probability density current from the state @xmath7 in the channel 0 to the state @xmath7 in the channel 1 , assuming that this current is positive in the downward direction ( see fig .",
    "the stationary - state conditions and the periodicity of the system require that @xmath23 to be a constant for any @xmath8 .",
    "then it leads to the following condition on the vertical currents , @xmath24    generally , each vertical current is not equal to zero , and to calculate the dynamic properties of the system analytically is mathematically very hard , except for @xmath3 and @xmath4 models as will be shown below .",
    "however , when the vertical transitions rates @xmath11 and @xmath14 are much larger than other transition rates , one expects that in the limit of large times there will be a `` dynamic '' equilibrium between two channels , i.e. , @xmath25 at each site .",
    "we call this a strong coupling limit . in this case , as shown in appendix , it is possible to obtain exact analytic expressions for the dynamic properties of the system .",

    "this is due to the dynamic equilibrium between two parallel pathways in the strong coupling limit .",
    "for the periodic two - chain coupled discrete stochastic models with @xmath3 the dynamics can be calculated explicitly for all parameters . because of eq .",
    "( [ vertical_currents ] ) the vertical current is always equal to zero at all sites , and the dynamics is the same as in the strong coupling limit . then the expressions for the mean velocity and dispersion can be easily obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ velocity ] ) and ( [ dispersion1 ] ) : @xmath34 @xmath35 it can be seen that both mean velocity and dispersion consist of two terms , corresponding to the motion along the pathways 0 and 1 . here",
    "@xmath36 and @xmath37 are the probabilities to find the particle on the channel 0 and 1 , respectively .",
    "now let us consider @xmath4 periodic two - chain discrete stochastic models . in this case",
    "the dynamic properties can be calculated by solving explicitly a set of master equations ( see appendix ) .",

    "it is interesting to compare these formulas with the results from the strong coupling limit .",
    "the mean velocity is given by a simpler equation , @xmath40 this formula directly corresponds to eq .",
    "( [ velocity ] ) .    in order to illustrate the effect of the coupling between the pathways we represent the vertical transition rates in the following form",
    "@xmath41 we take @xmath42 and @xmath43 as fixed parameters and vary only the parameters @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) and @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "the coefficient @xmath44 gives a measure of the coupling between the channels .",
    "when @xmath48 we reach the strong coupling limit , while for small values of @xmath44 the coupling is rather weak .",
    "the coefficient @xmath46 reflects the direction of the dominating vertical current .",
    "for @xmath49 the current is mainly upward from the chain 1 into the chain 0 , while for @xmath50 the vertical current changes the direction ( see fig .",
    "the mean velocities for @xmath4 model with different sets of parameters are presented in fig .",
    "it can be seen that the mean velocities do not depend strongly on the coupling between the pathways .",
    "thus the expression for the mean velocity generally can be well approximated by the strong coupling result .",
    "the situation is different for the diffusion constant .",
    "dispersions for different parameters are plotted in fig .",
    "3 . it is interesting to note that for a given set of the transition rates dispersion reaches a maximum for low values of @xmath44 and intermediate values of the parameter @xmath46 . when the coupling between the channels is weak ( @xmath51 ) the particle spends most of the time by diffusing in one of the channels before transferring to another one , and dispersion is large .",
    "however , for strong coupling ( @xmath52 ) the transitions between the vertical states are very frequent",
    ". the particle moves a short distance along the channel before transferring to the other chain , and , as a result , dispersion is low .",
    "the situation for low couplings between the channels is very similar to the picture of dynamic instability in microtubules.@xcite note also that this behavior can not be observed in @xmath3 models .",
    "this suggests that intermediate biochemical states might play a critical role for understanding dynamic instability in the cytoskeleton proteins .",
    "parallel - chain periodic discrete stochastic models with coupling between the channels are introduced and studied theoretically .",
    "the exact analytic expressions for the mean velocity and dispersion are found for the models with arbitrary period size in the limit of strong coupling .",
    "this corresponds to the dynamic equilibrium between the pathways and zero currents in the vertical directions at each state .",
    "for the two - chain discrete models with @xmath3 and @xmath4 periods the dynamic properties are calculated explicitly for general conditions .",
    "it is found that for weak coupling between the channels dispersion is maximal , while in the dynamic equilibrium regime it is significantly lower . at the same time",
    ", the effect of the coupling on the mean velocities is much smaller .",
    "our analysis can be extended to more general parallel - chain discrete stochastic models with more than two different pathways .",
    "in addition , it will interesting to to study the dynamics of these models under the influence of external forces.@xcite it is also suggested that these models can be used to investigate the transport of motor proteins and growth dynamics of cytoskeleton proteins .",
