    "as the underlying physical mechanism is believed to crucially depend on three - dimensional phenomena , such as turbulence , this is the only conceivable way towards self - consistent models of type ia supernova explosions .",
    "since @xcite reviewed type ia supernova explosion models , the field has witnessed a brisk development .",
    "progress in numerical methods and computational capabilities facilitated pioneering three - dimensional ( 3d ) simulations , which will be reviewed in the following .",
    "self - consistent sn  ia models are called for in order to achieve a sound understanding of the mechanism of these astrophysical events .",
    "this is motivated by their significant impact on many aspects of astrophysics and cosmology .",
    "being one of the main sources of iron group elements , sne  ia contribute to the chemical evolution of galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "they affect star formation and drive shock waves in the interstellar and intergalactic media .",
    "most remarkable , however , was the application of sne  ia in observational cosmology , where these objects were employed as distance indicators ( as put forward by * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "evidently , sne  ia are a valuable tool to extend the hubble diagram to large redshifts and to determine the hubble constant @xcite . at redshifts above 0.5 ,",
    "a significant deviation from the linear hubble law was noticed @xcite . here , sne  ia appear dimmer than expected in a matter - dominated flat or open friedmann - robertson - walker universe .",
    "this led to the spectacular interpretation that the expansion of universe is currently undergoing an acceleration .",
    "the determination of the driving force of this acceleration is one of the greatest challenges in contemporary physics .",
    "meanwhile it is parametrized as `` dark energy '' ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "determinations of cosmological parameters based on anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background radiation @xcite and on large - scale galaxy surveys provided independent confirmation of the sn  ia measurements .",

    "the simplest form of dark energy is a cosmological constant , but more complicated contributions to the energy - momentum tensor in the einstein equations are also conceivable .",

    "they can outshine an entire galaxy consisting of tens of billions of stars .",
    "sne  ia spectra are characterized by the lack of indications for hydrogen and helium which together with a pronounced p cygni silicon line at maximum light classifies these objects @xcite .",
    "lines of intermediate mass elements ( such as si , ca , mg and s ) and oxygen are observed in near - maximum light spectra ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with respect to light curve and spectra observations",
    "sne  ia form a class of remarkable homogeneity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "assuming supernovae to originate from single stellar objects , only their gravitational binding energy , released in a collapse towards a compact object @xcite , or its nuclear energy , released in explosive reactions @xcite , come into consideration as possible energy sources . in the particular case of sne",
    "ia no compact object is found in the remnant excluding the first possibility .",
    "the homogeneity of the class of sne  ia and the fact that no hydrogen is found in their spectra provides a strong hint that the object undergoing the nuclear explosion may be a white dwarf ( wd ) star consisting of carbon and oxygen ( c+o ) .",
    "lightcurves of sne  ia rise over a time scale of several days and decline over months .",
    "it is therefore clear that they can not be powered directly by the explosion since the temperatures fall off much too rapidly in the expansion .",
    "this problem was solved by @xcite and @xcite who suggested that the @xmath2ni produced in large amounts in the explosive thermonuclear burning provides the energy source for the optical event by radioactive decay to @xmath2co and @xmath2fe .",
    "a single wd is an inert object .",
    "how can it reach an explosive state ?",
    "the only way to introduce the necessary dynamics into the system is to assume it to be part of a binary system and to gain matter from the companion .",
    "several models have been proposed for this progenitor evolution .    in the _",
    "double degenerate _",
    "scenario @xcite , two c+o wds merge .",
    "the lighter of the two is disrupted and its matter accreted onto the heavier wd . to become a potential candidate for a sn  ia",
    ", the merger should eventually reach the chandrasekhar - mass ( i.e.  of the maximum mass that is supported against gravitational collapse by the pressure of the degenerate electrons ) .",
    "stellar evolution predicts that systems fulfilling this requirement should exist and indeed a potential candidate that will merge in less than one hubble time has been detected @xcite .",
    "mergers of two c+o wds provide a natural explanation for the absence of hydrogen .",
    "however , numerical simulations indicate that the high accretion rate onto the more massive wd leads to an off - center ignition and the subsequent burning could convert the material to oxygen , neon , and magnesium .",
    "a wd of this composition , however , tends to undergo a gravitational collapse rather than a thermonuclear explosion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the _ single degenerate _",
    "scenario @xcite , the wd accretes matter from a non - degenerate companion ( either a main sequence or an agb star ) .",
    "this idea was recently supported by the detection of the potential companion of tycho brahe s 1572 supernova @xcite , which is a solar - type star .",
    "a detailed analysis of this scenario , however , revealed that the accretion rates admissible here are restricted to a narrow window .",
    "too low rates evoke to nova eruptions in which the wd looses more material than accreted before and too high rates would lead to the formation of an extended he - rich envelope .",
    "moderate accretion rates build up a degenerate he - shell which could detonate and trigger a detonation of the carbon - oxygen core .",
    "since this happens before the wd reaches the chandrasekhar - mass limit , such a sn  ia model is termed _ sub - chandrasekhar _",
    "explosion @xcite .",
    "somewhat higher accretion rates , however , can lead to quiet hydrostatic burning of the accreted material processing it to carbon and oxygen . in this case",
    ", the wd may reach the chandrasekhar mass ( _ chandrasekhar - mass model _ , @xcite ) .",
    "potential candidates for such systems are supersoft x - ray sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the limitation the fuel available in the explosion to the chandrasekhar mass ( @xmath3@xmath4 ) makes the described scenario particularly favorable since it provides a natural explanation for the striking uniformity of sne  ia in the gross observational features . on the other hand ,",
    "it is afflicted with great uncertainties .",
    "achieving a stable mass transfer in the progenitor binary system to build up a chandrasekhar mass wd is highly non - trivial ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the observational evidence for such systems is sparse .",
    "although the striking homogeneity holds for most sne  ia ( so - called branch - normals , @xcite ) , some events differ significantly .",
    "these explode much weaker ( like sn  1991bg , see @xcite ) or more vigorous ( like sn  1991 t , see @xcite ) than the average . at present",
    "it is unclear , whether the entire class of sne  ia can be explained by only one progenitor scenario .",
    "the currently favored chandrasekhar - mass model may possibly only be able to explain the branch - normals while sub- and superluminous events require different progenitor scenarios .",
    "therefore , even if currently not in the focus of research , the double - degenerate and the sub - chandrasekhar mass scenarios may contribute to the sn  ia population . in the following , however , we will focus on the chandrasekhar - mass model , since it received most attention in recent theoretical modeling .    when the wd approaches the chandrasekhar limit , the density at the center of the wd increases rapidly so that fusion of carbon ignites .",
    "contrary to the situation in main sequence stars , the degenerate material of the wd does not allow for moderation of the burning by expansion .",
    "heat transport is achieved here by convection giving rise to a stage of convective carbon burning that lasts for several hundred years .",
    "this phase is terminated by one or more small spatial regions undergoing a thermonuclear runaway , marking the birth of a thermonuclear flame and the onset of the explosion . the convective burning stage and the conditions at flame ignition are extremely hard to model both analytically and numerically .",
    "therefore the exact shape and location of the first flame spark(s ) is not yet well constrained .",
    "these , however , are crucial initial parameters in multi - dimensional explosion models .",
    "only a few studies addressed the flame ignition process so far .",
    "@xcite simulated the thermonuclear runaway of a hot bubble floating upward from the center of the wd .",
    "they concluded that off - center and multi - spot ignitions are possible .",
    "a simular result was recently obtained by @xcite .",
    "the convective phase directly preceding the ignition crucially influences the configuration of the initial flame . here",
    "different studies led to controversial results .",
    "while @xcite and @xcite favor off - center , possibly multiple and asymmetrically distributed flame sparks , @xcite put forward a single central ignition .",
    "the goal of sn  ia explosion models is to follow the propagation of the thermonuclear flame from its ignition near the center of the wd outwards and to determine the composition and the distribution of the burning products in the ejected material .    theoretically , sn  ia explosions are governed by the equations of reactive fluid dynamics , i.e.  the navier - stokes equations extended with an equation of species balance , suitable terms for heat conduction , diffusion of species , and source terms of energy and species in combination with an equation of state ( eg .",
    "these equations allow for solutions of traveling reaction waves converting unburnt to burnt material . if the scales under consideration are much larger than the internal structures of these waves , a simplified description of the system is possible . neglecting all phenomena that actually govern the propagation of the reaction wave , i.e.  the reaction kinetics and transport processes ,",
    "the burning front is modeled as a moving discontinuity .",
    "this picture provides a description of the hydrodynamical state of the material in the unburnt and burnt regions and the equations simplify to the reactive euler equations . from these ,",
    "the rankine - hugoniot jump conditions for the state variables accross the burning front follow ( see * ? ? ? * ) which allow for two different modes of front propagation .",
    "one is the subsonic deflagration in which the flame is mediated by the thermal conduction of the degenerate electron gas and the other is a supersonic detonation in which the burning front is driven by shock waves .",
    "either one of these modes or a combination of both have been suggested in different explosion models .",
    "* _ the prompt detonation model _ was first applied in a numerical simulation by @xcite .",
    "a spherically symmetric detonation wave was initiated near the center of the wd and propagated outward .",
    "criteria for the spontaneous formation of a detonation wave have been investigated by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they reach the conclusion , that a detonation can initiate only under certain prerequisites . a prompt detonation as explosion model produces enough energy for a sn  ia event .",
    "however , ahead of a supersonic detonation wave the fuel can not expand and is therefore incinerated at the high densities of an equilibrium white dwarf .",
    "this results in the almost complete conversion of the material to nickel - peaked nuclear statistical equilibrium @xcite , which is in conflict with the intermediate mass elements observed in sn  ia spectra .",
    "these nucleosynthetic problems rule out a pure detonation scenario as a standard model for sn  ia explosions . *",
    "_ the deflagration model _",
    "@xcite assumes the flame propagating in the subsonic deflagration mode .",
    "the laminar burning speed of the deflagration flame is determined by microphysical transport processes . for conditions of carbon burning in c+o",
    "wds it is highly subsonic @xcite and therefore the flame propagates far too slowly to explain sn  ia explosions .",
    "the expansion of the star will quench burning before the wd gets unbound . on the other hand , this model can cure the problem of nucleosynthesis , since rarefaction waves travel ahead of the flame with sound speed and lower the fuel density prior to burning . thus the material can partly be processed into intermediate mass elements .",
    "+ the deflagration model undergoes a significant improvement when multidimensional effects are taken into account .",
    "the propagation of the deflagration front is subject to several instabilities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "of purely hydrodynamical origin is the landau - darrieus instability @xcite which in the nonlinear stage is stabilized in a cellular pattern @xcite thus enlarging the flame surface area and enhancing the net burning rate .",
    "the major effect accelerating the flame , however , is due to the buoyancy unstable flame propagation from the center of the star outwards .",
    "it leaves behind light and hot ashes below the dense fuel  a density statification inverse to the gravitational acceleration . in its non - linear stage",
    ", the rayleigh - taylor instability leads to the formation of mushroom - shaped burning bubbles raising into the fuel .",
    "the reynolds number typical for this situation is as high as @xmath5 .",
    "clearly , shear ( kelvin - helmholtz ) instabilities at the interfaces of these bubbles will generate turbulent eddies which then decay to smaller scales forming a turbulent energy cascade .",
    "the flame will interact with these eddies down to the gibson - scale at which the turbulent velocity fluctuations become comparable to the laminar flame speed .",
    "below the gibson scale , the flame burns faster through turbulent eddies than they can deform it , and the flame propagation is thus unaffected by turbulence there .",
    "this interaction corrugates the flame again increasing its surface and consequently accelerating the effective propagation speed . * _ the delayed detonation ( dd ) model _ conjoins the advantages of the deflagration and the detonation models .",
    "it was put forward by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "burning starts out in the slow deflagration mode pre - expanding the star .",
    "motivated by transitions from the deflagration to the supersonic detonation mode ( deflagration - to - detonation transition , ddt ) observed in terrestrial turbulent combustion processes , such a phenomenon is assumed to occur in sne  ia .",
    "its physical mechanism , however , remains unclear and therefore it enters the model as a free parameter .",
    "usually , in one - dimensional ( 1d ) simulations the ddt is artificially initiated once the flame reaches fuel of a certain transition density @xmath6 .",
    "the assumed detonation then burns the star until the flame is quenched by the expansion .",
    "this detonation is an easy way to explain the energy release necessary for a sn  ia explosion .",
    "the important notion in this model is that a detonation in low density fuel ( pre - expanded in the deflagration stage ) can lead to only partial burning and is therefore capable of generating intermediate mass elements .",
    "another possible advantage of this model derives from a problem of current 3d implementations of the pure deflagration scenario .",
    "the rayleigh - taylor bubbles being the origin of the turbulent flame acceleration cause considerable amounts of unburnt c+o matter to remain in `` fingers '' near the center of the star , which are possibly in conflict with spectral sn  ia observations . a detonation wave initiated at later stages of the evolution",
    "could be capable to burning out those fingers and to process the previously unburnt material .",
    "the best agreement with observations was achieved for @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the main disadvantage of the dd model is that this transition density remains an arbitrary parameter unless the mechanism of a possible ddt is physically determined ( if there exists one at all , cf .",
    "* ) . * _ the pulsational delayed detonation ( pdd ) model _",
    "@xcite is similar to the dd model in the sense that it combines an initial deflagration with a later detonation .",
    "the flame is assumed to propagate in the initial deflagration phase with its laminar burning speed and pre - expands the star .",
    "due to the slow flame velocity , the burning front stalls and fails to unbind the star .",
    "the wd then re - contracts giving the interface between burnt and unburnt material enough time to mix and to become nearly isothermal .",
    "compressional heating finally triggers a detonation at densities that are lower than that prior to the first expansion phase .",
    "@xcite employ this scenario in a phenomenological 1d model and conclude that it may account for sub - luminous sn  ia .",
    "however , the assumption that the flame propagates with the pure laminar burning velocity in the deflagration phase seems unrealistic , because of the flame instabilities and the resulting turbulent flame acceleration .",
    "recent multidimensional deflagration models @xcite demonstrated that taking into account these effects , the star is likely to get unbound instead of recontracting .",
    "the numerical implementation of sn  ia models accounting for the full exploding wd star in multiple dimensions is significantly complicated by the wide range of relevant length scales involved in the problem . from the radius of the wd star ( @xmath3@xmath8 at the onset of the explosion and expanding in the process ) it reaches down to the flame width which is well below one centimeter . in the deflagration model",
    "the relevance of turbulent effects amplifies the scale problem since the turbulent cascade extends to the even much smaller kolmogorov scale where the turbulent energy is dissipated into heat . here",
    ", the flame interaction with the turbulent cascade down to the gibson scale must additionally be taken into account .",
    "current 3d simulations capturing the entire star reach resolutions around one kilometer while the gibson scale is of the order of @xmath9 at the beginning of the explosion and decreases steadily .    for large - scale multi - dimensional sn  ia simulations",
    "this has three consequences .    1 .   [ enum2 ]",
    "the internal flame structure can not be resolved .",
    "thus , an effective flame model has to be applied and complementary small scale simulations are required .",
    "[ enum1 ] it is not possible to fully resolve the interaction of the flame with turbulence .",
    "therefore modeling of the effects on unresolved scales is necessary .",
    "assumptions about the flame properties at unresolved scales ( e.g.  stability below the gibson scale ) have to be validated in separate small - scale simulations .",
    "numerical models of sn  ia explosions have to face three major challenges .",
    "apart from the vast range of relevant length scales they need to take into account inherently three - dimensional physical phenomena and to solve the kinetics of nuclear burning . to meet all these requirements in a single simulation",
    "will be impossible in the foreseeable future .",
    "therefore the problem has been tackled in different approaches .    the first path towards sn  ia explosion modeling is to restrict the simulations to only one spatial dimension . here , in principle",
    "a resolution of the relevant scales is achievable and a detailed description of the nuclear reactions is feasible .",
    "however , crucial three - dimensional physical mechanisms are not explicitly taken into account and need to be parametrized .",
    "although such models were shown to yield good fits to observations and pioneered the insight into fundamentals of the explosion process , they lack consistency and are of little predictive power .    in multi - dimensional simulations ,",
    "contrariwise , the computational costs of modeling the explosion hydrodynamics is prohibitive to directly resolve all relevant scales as well as details of the nuclear processes .",
    "while the latter may be improved in the forthcoming years , and is meanwhile separated from the actual explosion simulations still maintaining a reasonable accuracy ( see below ) , even a drastic increase in computational capabilities will not allow for a resolution of all scales in multi - dimensional simulations .",
    "a third approach is to study specific effects on a limited range of spatial scales , to validate assumptions and improve modeling techniques of the large - scale sn  ia simulations .",
    "although we focus on multi - dimensional models of sn  ia explosions , we will first give a brief overview of 1d spherically symmetric simulations .",
    "since ( at least in the initial deflagration stage ) the propagation velocity of the thermonuclear flame is determined by multi - dimensional effects , such as instabilities and interaction with turbulent velocity fluctuations , a physically undetermined speed is ascribed to the spherical burning front .",
    "this free parameter can be used to fit the observations and therefore give a hint to the expected average temporal evolution of the flame in multi - dimensional simulations .",
    "the best known of these models , w7 , was presented by @xcite and @xcite and has been employed in several studies since then ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the flame propagation speed was modeled with mixing length theory and started slowly to pre - expand the star .",
    "later it strongly accelerated and consumed large fractions of the star converting the material to iron - group elements ( mainly @xmath2ni ) and intermediate mass elements .",
    "different ways to parameterize the flame propagation velocity were proposed by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "all these models conclude that a flame acceleration to one third of the sound speed is necessary for consistency of the results with observations .",
    "the problem of overproduction of neutron - rich iron - group material noted in these models may be significantly reduced when taking into account revised electron capture rates @xcite .    when applying 1d models to simulate delayed - detonation scenarios , the condition for the ddt comes into play as a second undetermined parameter .",
    "such models are capable of providing excellent fits to lightcurves and spectra and seem to yield reasonable compositions of the nucleosynthesis products @xcite .    although lacking consistency and therefore predictive power , 1d models have been employed to address questions arising from sn  ia cosmology , such as the origin of the diversity in these objects @xcite .      initiated by @xcite ,",
    "multi - dimensional models were applied to fix the turbulent flame propagation velocity undetermined in spherically symmetric simulations . given the wide range of scales on which the flame is affected by turbulence , this is an ambitious project , additionally challenged by the lack of resolution of the thermonuclear flame structure .",
    "for both problems , different approaches have been taken .",
    "all these were guided by the theory of turbulent combustion in terrestrial flames ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the hydrodynamical equations are discretized either in a lagrangean or eulerian approach .",
    "the smooth particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) technique used by @xcite falls into the first category , while an implicit scheme on an eulerian grid is applied by @xcite .",
    "most explicit eulerian approaches were based on versions of the prometheus implementation @xcite of the piecewise parabolic method ( ppm ) proposed by @xcite .",
    "these include the simulations of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach was taken by @xcite , who modified the hydrodynamical equations to account for low - mach number flows only .",
    "this provides an efficient scheme to numerically simulate subsonic deflagrations .",
    "the facts that the wd star is expanding and that the flame is not necessary domain - filling in all stages of the explosion is taken into account in the grid - based schemes in various approaches . while @xcite use a static computational grid with a fine - resolved central part and a coarse outer grid to account for the expansion , @xcite implemented a uniform moving grid that co - expands with the exploding wd . since on average",
    "the explosion process is more or less spherical , one can gain resolution in the part of the star occupied by the flame with nested moving grids @xcite .",
    "a different technique providing resolution where needed is adaptive mesh refinement as applied in the simulations by @xcite and @xcite .      in earlier works @xcite the flame",
    "was advanced according to discrete boolean criteria .",
    "a computational cell was burned if certain conditions in neighboring cells were fulfilled .",
    "this strategy is clearly dependent on the grid geometry and therefore in recent simulations different approaches have been taken .",
    "two major strategies to tackle the problem of the unresolved internal flame structure can be distinguished .",
    "@xcite adapted a flame capturing technique that mimics flame propagation by an artificial diffusion mechanism which broadens the internal flame structure to a certain number of computational grid cells .",
    "this method was applied in the sn  ia explosion simulations by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "a completely different approach was taken by @xcite , who treat the flame as a sharp discontinuity separating the fuel from the ashes .",
    "it is numerically represented applying the level - set technique @xcite . here",
    "the flame front is associated with the zero level set of a scalar function @xmath10 representing the distance from the interface . a model for flame propagation based on this technique",
    "was developed by @xcite and a modified version for thermonuclear flames in sn  ia explosion was presented by @xcite ( for details of the implementation see also * ? ? ?",
    "this scheme was applied in the simulations by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "as outlined above , sn  ia explosions are believed to at least start out subsonically in the deflagration mode of flame propagation .",
    "thus the flame is subject to the interaction with turbulence generated by instabilities .",
    "this mechanism turns out to be crucial to accelerate the flame propagation and must therefore be taken into account in any valid sn  ia model .",
    "the theory of turbulent combustion has been extensively developed for terrestrial combustion phenomena ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the nuclear reaction kinetics in thermonuclear combustion waves is much simpler than the chemical reactions in terrestrial flames and due to the high thermal conductivity of the degenerate electron gas in wd matter some of the characteristic nondimensional numbers differ . nonetheless , the turbulent combustion process in the deflagration mode in sne  ia bears striking similarity to _ premixed turbulent flames _ ( i.e.  turbulent flames in mixtures of fuel and oxidizer ) in terrestrial combustion processes .",
    "the wide range of scales involved in turbulent combustion phenomena renders direct simulations impossible for most situations .",
    "therefore only parts of the interaction range of the flame with turbulence and the resulting surface enlargement of the flame can be resolved .",
    "this is usually compensated by attributing an effective _ turbulent flame speed _",
    "@xmath11 to the unresolved flame front , which must be determined by theoretical considerations .",
    "one of the cornerstones of the theoretical description of turbulent combustion is the notion of different regimes of flame / turbulence interaction @xcite .",
    "these regimes are distinguished by the ability of turbulent eddies to penetrate the internal flame structure .",
    "since the gibson scale is much larger than the flame width for most parts of the sn  ia explosion , this will not be the case here and accordingly the combustion falls into the regime of _ wrinkled and corrugated flamelets_. here , the full flame structure is corrugated by the interaction with turbulence and the resulting surface enlargement accelerates its propagation . as first noted by @xcite , the flame propagation in this regime",
    "completely decouples from the microphysics of the burning for sufficiently strong turbulence .",
    "it is entirely determined by the turbulent velocity fluctuations , that is , @xmath11 is proportional to the turbulent velocity fluctuations .",
    "one of the challenges of deflagration models of sn  ia explosions is thus to determine these velocity fluctuations correctly .",
    "since the resolution in multi - dimensional simulations is insufficient to resolve the phenomena directly , modeling approaches have to be taken . in the simplest models , a minimal propagation velocity of the flame",
    "is artificially imposed , which is not physically determined in the model @xcite .",
    "contrary to this , @xcite , and @xcite assume the flame to be driven by buoyancy - induced instabilities on unresolved scales giving rise to a turbulent flame speed of @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 denote the gravitational acceleration and the computational grid cell size , respectively .",
    "@xmath15 is the atwood number derived from the density contrast over the flame front .",
    "a more sophisticated approach was proposed by @xcite .",
    "guided by the technique of _ large eddy simulations _ they implemented a turbulent subgrid - scale model @xcite in sn  ia explosion simulations .",
    "this model determines the turbulence energy on unresolved scales based on conservation laws .",
    "the hyperbolic nature of the equations of hydrodynamics , however , does not allow for a closed system of equations here so that closure assumptions have to be invoked .",
    "a physically better motivated approach based on localized closures was recently proposed by @xcite .    in the very late stages of the sn  ia explosion the fuel density drops due to expansion of the wd to values where the flame width becomes broader than the gibson length .",
    "then , turbulence penetrates the internal structure of the flame and it enters the regime of _ distributed burning _ @xcite . here , different scaling laws for the turbulent flame speed apply @xcite and a preliminary test of the effects on sn  ia models was given by @xcite .",
    "the computational expenses for a full nuclear reaction network are prohibitive to run it concurrently with the explosion hydrodynamics simulations in present multi - dimensional models .",
    "since here the only dynamically relevant parameter is the energy release in the reactions , it is sufficient to apply a simplified description . usually , only a few nuclei representative for the fuel mixture , the iron group elements and the intermediate mass elements in the ashes and effective reactions between them are accounted for ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , in order to derive observables ( such as lightcurves and spectra ) from the explosion models , the exact chemical composition of the ejecta needs to be known .",
    "this can be achieved by advecting a number of tracer particles in the explosion hydrodynamics simulations which record the evolution of temperature and density .",
    "this adds a lagrangean component to the eulerian code .",
    "based on the data gained from the tracer particles it is then possible to _ a posteriori _ reconstruct the detailed nuclear reactions in the burnt material with extended nuclear reaction networks .",
    "this technique was implemented for sne  ia by @xcite and also applied in the study by @xcite .      while earlier two - dimensional ( 2d ) deflagration models of sn  ia failed to explode ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) others succeeded to ( weakly ) unbind the wd @xcite .",
    "nowadays , it seems that a consensus has been reached on the general capability of the 3d version of this model to give rise to robust explosions @xcite .",
    "although the energetics ( asymptotic kinetic energy up to @xmath16 ) and the production of @xmath2ni ( @xmath3@xmath17 ) as the main global characteristcs fall into the range of observational expectations @xcite , they are still on the weaker side of `` normal '' sne  ia .",
    "since the initial flame configuration in the explosion is undetermined yet ( see sect .",
    "[ sect : progenitor_ignition ] ) , several studies addressed its effect on the outcome of the simulations .",
    "off - center ignitions were analyzed based on 2d - simulations by @xcite and 3d - full star simulations by @xcite .",
    "the latter study indicated that a single perfectly spherical off - center initial flame quickly emerges to the surface of the wd and fails to burn sufficient material to explode it .",
    "@xcite suggested that the material breaking through the surface of the still gravitationally bound wd may collimate on the opposite side of it , evoking a detonation there .",
    "contraty to that , @xcite found that a more structured off - center initial flame ( motivated by pre - ignition convection , cf .",
    "[ sect : progenitor_ignition ] ) stays more or less in place and gives rise to a viable explosion .",
    "the effects of the number of ignition spots have been addressed in several 2d studies @xcite giving a wide range of results dependent on the number and distribution of the initial flame kernels and in 3d simulations @xcite .",
    "these simulations indicate that multi - spot ignition scenarios can lead to more vigorous explosions than centrally ignited setups and put the deflagration scenario in better agreement with observations .",
    "interestingly , the 3d simulations , although also exhibiting a depencence on the number of ignition spots , gave much more robust results than the 2d studies @xcite .",
    "similar conclusions were drawn on the basis of a stochastic ignition model in which a spatial and temporal distribution of the flame ignition spots was assumed @xcite .",
    "a successful explosion , however , is not the only requirement for a valid sn  ia model .",
    "observables derived from such models must match the observations of sne  ia .",
    "moreover , the model must allow for a certain variation of the results in order to reproduce the observed range of diversity in the characteristics .",
    "no general consensus has been reached so far regarding these questions . besides the low explosion energies and @xmath2ni production the problems of most deflagration simulations include unburnt material left behind at low velocities in the ejecta due to downdrafts in the buoyancy - induced large - scale flame pattern and low production of intermediate mass elements .",
    "recently , a series of 3d simulaions was analyzed to determine wheter these shortcomings are generic to the deflagration model or caused by the simplicity of some setups .",
    "it seems that the model is generally capable of reproducing main observational features , but some of the problems persist ( see sect .",
    "[ sect : def ] for details ) .",
    "@xcite claim that a delayed detonation is necessary to achieve agreement with observations . in their 3d model ,",
    "a detonation front is artificially initiated after a deflagration stage at a pre - selected time and location .",
    "as expected , it travels through the wd burning most of the materinal in the inner parts .",
    "a 2d implementation of the delayed detonation model was recently presented by @xcite . here , the ddt is assumed to occur when the deflagration flame enters the distributed burning regime which appatently happens first in the outer parts of the flame front .",
    "this rises the question of whether the detonation ( if not allowed to travel through ashes ) can catch up with the expanding material on the opposite side of the wd .",
    "2d simulations by @xcite studied pure prompt detonation in rapidly rotating wds .",
    "although here regions may exist with densities allowing for the production of intermediate mass elements , the authors conclude , that the ratio of iron group elements to intermediate mass elements arising from such models is inconsistent with normal sne  ia .    to settle the question of the explosion mechanism , detailed analysis of the differnt models and comparison with observations on the basis of synthetic light curves and spectra are required .",
    "complementary studies of flame propagation on small scales focus on effects in only a narrow window in scale space .",
    "these therefore reach a much higher resolution and can model the processes in a more realistic way than sn  ia simulations on scales of the wd star .",
    "consequently , they give insight into mechanisms that are unresolved there either testing the validity of assumptions or providing input data to these models .    on the basis of",

    "most of these simulations confirm the assumptions made in large - scale sn  ia models .",
    "the question whether a transition of the turbulent burning regime from flamelet to distributed burning would cause a deflagration - to - detonation transition was addressed by @xcite , who conclude that such an event is very unlikely .",
    "to illustrate the numerical modeling of sn  ia explosions in three spatial dimensions , a deflagration model in a specific implementation shall be discussed in this section .",

    "the numerical techniques forming the foundation of the implementation of the deflagration sn  ia model presented here are described by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the fundamental approach is that of _ large eddy simulations _ , where hydrodynamics on the resolved scales is modeled in a _",
    "finite volume approach _ based on the prometheus implementation @xcite .",
    "the equation of state describing wd material contains contributions from an arbitrarily degerneate and relativistic electron gas , an ideal gas of nuclei , radiation , and possibly electron - positron pair creation and annihilation .    as a consequence of [ enum1 ] of the enumeration in sect .",
    "[ sect : scales ] , a _ subgrid - scale model _",
    "is applied to account for turbulent effects on unresolved scales .",
    "some older simulations follow the implementation suggested by @xcite , while one recent highly resolved run applied the updated modeling approach of @xcite .    according to [ enum2 ] of the enumeration , the flame representation is achieved in a modeling approach .",

    "the evolution of such an interface is the _ level set technique",
    "_ introduced to sn  ia modeling by @xcite . in this implementation",
    ", the flame propagation speed needs to be prescribed .",

    "nuclear burning terminates in nuclear statistical equilibrium represented by a mixture of @xmath2ni and @xmath21-particles .",
    "once the fuel density drops below @xmath22 , burning will become incomplete and intermediate mass elements ( represented by @xmath23 mg ) are produced .",
    "the respective difference in nuclear binding energy is released which provides sufficient accuracy to model the dynamics of the explosion .",
    "the chemical composition of the ejecta is derived in a postprocessing step @xcite .",
    "several simulations based on the implementation described above , both in two and three spatial dimensions , have been presented by @xcite . in the 2d simulations , numerical convergence in the global quantities",
    "was demonstrated .",
    "for the implementation on a co - expanding computational grid , a similar result was found by @xcite ( see fig .  [",

    "the numerical convergence naturally arises from the interplay of the resolved flame front representation with the turbulent subgrid - scale model .",
    "ideally , a lack of resolution of large - scale features in the flame front representation should be compensated by an increased turbulent flame propagation velocity determined from the subgrid - scale approach . of course",
    ", a certain threshold of resolution will need to be exceeded to reach this regime in the numerical implementation .",
    "one requirement to reliably derive observables from simulations is that the evolution of the models be followed to the stage of homologous expansion . in this hydrodynamically relaxed situation ,",
    "the velocity of the ejected material is proportional to its radius .",
    "obviously , a static computational grid that sufficiently resolves the flame propagation does not allow to follow the expansion over sufficiently long time scales",
    ". therefore @xcite proposed to use a moving computational grid that co - expands with the wd . with this implementation",
    "it is in principle possible to follow the evolution for arbitrary times , but @xcite showed that simulating the first @xmath24 after ignition is sufficient to reach homology with reasonable accuracy .",
    "an example of such a simulation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : c3 ] , where the isosurface represents the zero level set of @xmath10 and is associated with the flame front .",
    "this simulation was carried out on only one octant of the wd assuming mirror symmetry to the other octants .",
    "the flame was ignited centrally with a toroidal perturbation superposed to the spherical shape .",
    "of course , at times after @xmath3@xmath25 when burning terminates in the model , the zero level set of @xmath10 looses physical meaning , but it still indicates the approximate boundary between unburnt material and ashes .    due to the high computational expenses , most 3d simulations ( such as the one described above ) comprise only one octant of the wd . however , only full - star setups allow to account for asymmetry effects . on the basis of spectrapolarimetry observations of several sne  ia ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) these are expected to occur in at least some explosions .",
    "@xcite showed , that in the deflagration model such asymmetries arise exclusively from irregularities in the flame ignition conditions and not from large - scale instabilities and resulting prefered modes in the flow patterns .",
    "therefore , fixing a symmetric initial flame shape and studying the influence of other physical parameters on single - octant explosion models is a valid approach ( see sect .  [ sect : div ] below ) .    to illustrate the typical flame evolution in deflagration sn  ia models ,",
    "the full - star model presented by @xcite shall be described here .",
    "it started out from an asymmetric initial flame configuration which was set up by randomly distributing spherical flame kernels around the center of the wd .",
    "this resulted in a foamy structure slightly misaligned with the center of the wd .",
    "starting from this initial flame configuration ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : evo ] ) , the evolution of the flame front in the explosion process is illustrated by snapshots of the @xmath26 isosurface at @xmath27 and @xmath28 in fig .",
    "[ fig : evo ] .",
    "the development of the flame shape from ignition to @xmath27 is characterized by the formation of the well - known `` mushroom - like '' structures resulting from buoyancy .",
    "this is especially well visible for the bubbles that were detached from the bulk of the initial flame .",
    "but also the perturbed parts of the contiguous flame closer to the center develop nonlinear rayleigh - taylor like features . during the following flame evolution ,",
    "inner structures of smaller scales catch up with the outer `` mushrooms '' and the initially separated structures merge forming a more closed configuration ( see snapshot at @xmath29 of fig .",
    "[ fig : evo ] ) .",
    "this is a result of the large - scale flame advection in the turbulent flow and the expansion of the ashes . up to this stage",
    "the flame was strongly anisotropic .",
    "however , in the later evolution a preferentially lateral growth of bubbles filled with ashes smoothes out parts of the anisotropies .",
    "the flame develops a more spherical shape and only a slight anisotropy is retained .",
    "after about @xmath25 self - propagation of the flame due to burning has terminated in the model .",
    "the subsequent evolution is characterized by the approach to homologous expansion .",
    "the resulting density structure at the end of the simulation is shown in the @xmath30 snapshot of fig .  [",
    "fig : evo ] .",
    "the flame evolution agrees with the expectations outlined in sect .",
    "[ sect : flame_explosion ] .",
    "since the flame ignition process is not modeled in the explosion simulations , there exists considerable freedom in choosing the number and distribution of ignition kernels ( cf.sect .",
    "[ sect : progenitor_ignition ] ) .",
    "the results from models starting with a central ignition ( cf .  fig .",
    "[ fig : c3 ] ) indicate that such a setup leads only to weak explosions .",
    "recently , the capabilities of multi - spot ignition models have been analyzed in a systematic way .",
    "this was possible due to a modification of the moving grid implementation to two nested grids .",
    "an inner , fine - resolved grid follows the flame propagation while an outer coarse grid tracks the wd expansion @xcite . in this way",
    ", it is possible to accumulate a large fraction of the available computational cells in the inner regions thereby resolving detailed multi - ignition configurations . confining the ignition volume around the center of the wd",
    ", it may be expected that there exists a certain number of ignition spots which maximizes the burning and energy release .",
    "a sparse ignition would decrease the flame surface and thus the burning rate , while a too dense distribution of flame kernels will lead to a rapid merging of flame parts again decreasing the surface area .",
    "this was confirmed by the simulations , which however did not sharply single out an optimal number of ignition points but revealed a rather robust behavior over a wide range .",
    "extreme cases , however , reproduced the anticipated dependence .",
    "due to recent progress in deriving observables from multi - dimensional deflagration simulations , a direct comparison with details of observations of nearby sne  ia has come into reach .",
    "since these contain no other parameters than the initial conditions , the question arises if the outcome of simulations as the ones described above meets the observational constraints .",
    "such constraints result from the global characteristics derived from observations , observed light curves , and spectra taken from nearby sne ia .",
    "the global characteristics derived from sn  ia observations state that a valid explosion model should release around @xmath31 of energy and produce @xmath3@xmath32 of @xmath2ni in the nuclear burning @xcite . however , there exists a large diversity in the observations ranging from the class of sub - luminous sne  ia ( like sn  1991bg with probably @xmath3@xmath33 of @xmath2ni ) to super - luminous events ( e.g.  sn  1991 t with a @xmath2ni mass close to @xmath34 ) .",
    "deflagration models started with a multi - spot ignition setup typically possess @xmath35 of asymptotic kinetic energy of the ejecta .",
    "they produce up to @xmath36 of @xmath2ni .",
    "thus they fall into the range of observational expectations , but in the current stage do not account for the more energetic sne  ia .",
    "one reason for the low energetics may be that in the presented implementation nuclear burning is assumed to cease when the fuel density drops below @xmath37 , because the flame is then expected to enter the distributed burning regime .",
    "an approach to handling this stage was given by @xcite .",
    "+      a further requirement is that synthetic lightcurves agree with observed ones .",

    "a much harder test for the models is posed by the comparison of synthetic with observed spectra since these depend on details in the composition of the ejected material .",
    "nebular spectra provide a means of studying the central parts of the ejecta , since they are taken at epochs where these have become transparent due to expansion .",

    "an inconsistency of the model with the observed nebular spectra is the appearance of a pronounced oxygen line at @xmath39 .",
    "both features of the synthetic spectrum share a common origin .",
    "the broad iron lines are caused by nse material that is transported in the uprising plumes of ashes and thus distributed in velocity space . at the same time",

    "this abundance tomography of the ejecta can be compared with results of 3d models , when averaged over the angles .",
    "qualitatively , the mixed composition of the ejecta found by @xcite is reproduced by deflagration sn  ia models in a natural way since these predict a distribution of burnt material with the rising bubbles .",

    "such an approach was recently taken by @xcite and resulted in the first systematic study of progenitor parameters in 3d models .",

    "this finding is consistent with the flame very similar flame evolution in simulations with different carbon mass fraction of the wd ( cf .",

    "therefore less @xmath2ni is produced in these models .",
    "this effect is even more pronounced due to the fact that in low - density wds less material is present at sufficient densities to be potentially burnt to nse .",

    "here , electron captures will become important favoring neutron - rich isotopes over @xmath2ni in the nse .",
    "the dynamical effects of electron captures are , however , not yet implemented in the explosion model and therefore the survey of @xcite is restricted to relatively low central densities .    a higher metallicity of the main sequence progenitor star results in an increased @xmath40ne mass fraction in the wd .",
    "this is an isotope with neutron excess and therefore again favors the production of neutron - rich species over @xmath2ni in the nse .",
    "the results of @xcite confirm the analytic prediction by @xcite and agree with @xcite .",
