    "the @xmath14 evolution of the gluon distribution @xmath12 is described by dglap evolution equation @xcite . in the so - called @xmath0-factorization approach hadronic and partonic cross sections",
    "are related by the following condition @xcite : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the @xmath17-pair photoproduction cross section on off mass - shell gluon , @xmath18 is the gluon virtuality , @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the azimuthal angle in the transverse xoy plane between vector @xmath21 and the fixed ox axis .",
    "the unintegrated gluon distribution function @xmath22 can be related to the conventional gluon distribution by @xmath23 where @xmath22 satisfies the bfkl evolution equation @xcite . in formulae  ( 2 )",
    "the four - vector of a gluon momentum is presented as follows : @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the four - vector of a proton momentum . at the @xmath27",
    "the off mass - shell gluon has dominant longitudinal polarization along the proton momentum . taking into account the gauge invariance of a total amplitude involving virtual gluon",
    "we can write the polarization four - vector in two different forms : @xmath28 or @xmath29 as it will be shown above formulae ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) give the equal answers in calculating of squared amplitudes under consideration .",
    "our calculation in the parton model is down using the grv lo @xcite parameterization for the collinear gluon distribution function @xmath30 . in the case of the @xmath0-factorization approach we use the following parameterizations for an unintegrated gluon distribution function @xmath31 : jb by bluemlein @xcite ; js by jung and salam @xcite ; kmr by kimber , martin and ryskin @xcite .",
    "the detail analysis of the evolution equations lied in a basis of the different parameterizations is over our consideration . to compare different parameterizations",
    "we have plotted their as a function of @xmath13 at the fixed @xmath32 and @xmath33 in fig.1 and as a function of @xmath32 at the fixed @xmath13 and @xmath33 in fig.2 .",
    "note , that all parameterizations of an unintegrated gluon distribution function describe the data from hera collider for the structure function @xmath34 well @xcite .",
    "the photoproduction of the @xmath2 meson was studding experimentally by h1 and zeus collaborations at hera ep - collider ( @xmath35 gev , @xmath36 gev ) @xcite .",
    "because of the large mass of a @xmath37-quark usually it is assumed that @xmath2 meson production may be described in the fragmentation approach @xcite , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 is the universal fragmentation function of a @xmath37-quark into the @xmath2 meson at the scale @xmath40 .",
    "the fraction of the @xmath2 produced by a @xmath37-quark as measured by opal collaboration @xcite , @xmath41 has been used in our lo qcd calculations to normalize the fragmentation function .",

    "we used formulas for differential cross section in the following form : @xmath85 the differential cross section as a function of the @xmath2 pseudorapidity , which is defined as @xmath86 , where the polar angle @xmath87 is measured with respect to the proton beam direction , is shown in fig.3 where the kinematic ranges for the @xmath2 meson transverse momentum are @xmath88 gev , @xmath89 gev , @xmath90 gev , correspondingly from up to down .",
    "we see that the results of calculations performed in the collinear parton with lo in @xmath91 matrix element need additional @xmath92-factor @xmath93 to describe the data .",
    "the value of this @xmath92-factor is usual for a heavy quark production cross section in the relevant energy range .",
    "opposite the results obtained in @xmath0-factorization approach are agree with the data well . especially in case of the jb parameterization of a unintegrated gluon distribution function .",
    "the difference between the predictions obtained with the various parameterizations is about factor 2 near the peak of the cross section @xmath94 .",
    "note that our results coincide with the results of the ref.@xcite in case of the jb parameterization .",
    "the @xmath3 spectrum of @xmath2 meson in photoproduction at @xmath95 and @xmath68 gev are shown in fig.4 . the theoretical curve in the @xmath0-factorization approach obtained using the jb parameterization describes data well at the all @xmath3 .",
    "the curves obtained using kmr or js parameterizations coincide with the data only at the @xmath96 gev .",
    "the typical value of the @xmath92-factor in case of lo parton model calculation is equal 2 at the large @xmath3 .",
    "our results show that the introducing of a gluon transverse momentum @xmath0 in the framework of the @xmath0-factorization approach increase the @xmath2 meson photoproduction cross section at the large @xmath3 in case of the js parameterization , as it is predicted for the @xmath5 photoproduction @xcite ( see next part of the paper ) and at the all relevant values of the @xmath3 in case of kmr or jb parameterizations .",
    "the dependence of the @xmath2 meson production cross section on a total photon - proton center - of - mass energy w is shown in fig.5 . nowadays the experimental data for @xmath97 are absent .",
    "we see that the difference between the results obtained with the various parameterizations of a unintegrated gluon distribution function is about 50% . as well in the case of the @xmath98-spectra . at the all @xmath99",
    "the cross section calculated in the parton model is smaller than predictions obtained in the @xmath0-factorization approach .",
    "the main uncertainties of our calculation come from the choice of a @xmath37-quark mass in the partonic matrix elements ( 10),(11 ) and ( 13 ) , and from the choice of a parameter @xmath100 in the peterson fragmentation function @xmath101 .",
    "we see that agreement between the results obtained in the @xmath0-factorization approach and the data on the @xmath102 meson photoproduction is better at the large @xmath3 .",
    "this fact shows that in the @xmath0-factorization approach the next to leading order corrections are taken into account effectively .",
    "it is well known that in the processes of @xmath103 meson photoproduction on protons at high energies the photon - gluon fusion partonic subprocess dominates @xcite . in the framework of the general factorization approach of qcd the @xmath103 photoproduction cross section depends on the gluon distribution function in a proton , the hard amplitude of @xmath17-pair production as well as the mechanism of a creation colorless final state with quantum numbers of the @xmath103 meson .",
    "in such a way , we suppose that the soft interactions in the initial state are described by introducing a gluon distribution function , the hard partonic amplitude is calculated using perturbative theory of qcd at order in @xmath104 , where @xmath105 , and the soft process of the @xmath17-pair transition into the @xmath103 meson is described in nonrelativistic approximation using series in the small parameters @xmath91 and @xmath106 ( relative velocity of the quarks in the @xmath103 meson ) .",
    "as is said in nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) @xcite , there are color singlet mechanism , in which the @xmath17-pair is hardly produced in the color singlet state , and color octet mechanism , in which the @xmath17-pair is produced in the color octet state and at a long distance it transforms into a final color singlet state in the soft process .",
    "however , as it was shown in papers @xcite , the data from the desy ep - collider @xcite in the wide region of @xmath3 and @xmath6 may be described well in the framework of the color singlet model and the color octet contribution is not needed .",
    "based on the above mentioned result we will take into account in our analysis only the color singlet model contribution in the @xmath103 meson photoproduction @xcite . we consider here the role of a proton gluon distribution function in the @xmath103 photoproduction in the framework of the conventional parton model as well as in the framework of the @xmath0-factorization approach @xcite .",
    "there are six feynman diagrams ( fig.6 ) which describe the partonic process @xmath107 at the leading order in @xmath91 and @xmath108 . in the framework of the color singlet model and nonrelativistic approximation the production of the @xmath103 meson",
    "is considered as the production of a quark - antiquark system in the color singlet state with orbital momentum @xmath109 and spin momentum @xmath110 .",
    "the binding energy and relative momentum of quarks in the @xmath103 are neglected .",
    "in such a way @xmath111 and @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is the 4-momentum of the @xmath103 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 are 4-momenta of quark and antiquark . taking into account the formalism of the projection operator @xcite the amplitude of the process @xmath116 may be obtained from the amplitude of the process @xmath117 after replacement : @xmath118 where @xmath119 , @xmath120 is a 4-vector of the @xmath103 polarization , @xmath121 is the color factor , @xmath122 is the nonrelativistic meson wave function at the origin .",
    "the matrix elements of the process @xmath123 may be presented as follows : @xmath124 @xmath125\\mbox{,}\\ ] ] @xmath126\\mbox{,}\\ ] ] @xmath127\\mbox{,}\\ ] ] @xmath128\\mbox{,}\\ ] ] @xmath129\\mbox{,}\\ ] ] @xmath130\\mbox{,}\\ ] ] where @xmath131 is the 4-momentum of the photon , @xmath132 is the 4-momentum of the initial gluon , @xmath133 is the 4-momentum of the final gluon , @xmath134\\mbox{,}\\quad e_c=\\frac{2}{3}\\mbox{,}\\quad e=\\sqrt{4\\pi\\alpha}\\mbox{,}\\quad g_s=\\sqrt{4\\pi\\alpha_s}\\mbox{.}\\ ] ] the summation on the photon , the @xmath103 meson and final gluon polarizations is carried out by covariant formulae : @xmath135 in case of the initial bfkl gluon we use the prescription ( 5 ) . for studing @xmath103 polarized photoproduction",
    "we introduce the 4-vector of the longitudinal polarization as follows : @xmath136 in the high energy limit of @xmath137 the polarization 4-vector satisfies usual conditions @xmath138 , @xmath139 .",
    "traditionally for a description of charmonium photoproduction processes the invariant variable @xmath140 is used . in the rest frame of the proton one",
    "has @xmath141 . in the @xmath0-factorization approach the differential on @xmath142 and @xmath6",
    "cross section of the @xmath103 photoproduction may be written as follows : @xmath143    the analytical calculation of the @xmath144 is performed with help of reduce package and results are saved in the fortran codes as a function of @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 , @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "we directly have tested that @xmath151 where @xmath152 in the @xmath144 and @xmath153 is the square of the amplitude in the conventional parton model @xcite . in the limit of @xmath154 from formula ( 27 )",
    "it is easy to find the differential cross section in the parton model , too : @xmath155 however , making calculations in the parton model we use formula ( 27 ) , where integration over @xmath149 and @xmath62 is performed numerically , instead of ( 29 ) .",
    "this method fixes the common normalization factor for both approaches and gives a direct opportunity to study effects connected with virtuality of the initial bfkl gluon in the partonic amplitude .",
    "after we fixed the selection of the gluon distribution functions @xmath30 or @xmath156 there are two parameters only , which values determine the common normalization factor of the cross section under consideration : @xmath122 and @xmath157 .",
    "the value of the @xmath103 meson wave function at the origin may be calculated in a potential model or obtained from experimental well known decay width @xmath158 . in our calculation",
    "we used the following choice @xmath159 gev@xmath160 which corresponds to nrqcd coefficient @xmath161 gev@xmath160 as the same as in ref .",
    "note , that this value is a little smaller ( 30 % ) than the value which was used in our paper @xcite . concerning a charmed quark mass ,",
    "the situation is not clear up to the end . from one hand , in the nonrelativistic approximation",
    "one has @xmath162 , but there are many examples of taking smaller value of a @xmath37-quark mass in the amplitude of a hard process , for example , @xmath163 gev . taking into consideration above mentioned we perform calculations at @xmath164 gev .",
    "the cinematic region under consideration is determined by the following conditions : @xmath165 gev@xmath70 , @xmath166 gev , @xmath167 and @xmath168 gev , which correspond to the h1 collaboration data @xcite .",
    "we assume that the contribution of the color octet mechanism is large at the @xmath169 only . in the region of the small values of the @xmath170 the contribution of the resolved photon processes @xcite as well as the charm excitation processes @xcite may be large , too . all of these contributions are not in our consideration .    figs .",
    "710 show our results which were obtained as in the conventional parton model as well as in the @xmath0-factorization approach with the different parameterizations of the unintegrated gluon distribution function .",
    "the dependence of the results on selection of a hard scale parameter @xmath171 is much less than the dependence on selection of a @xmath37-quark mass and selection of a parameterization .",
    "we put @xmath172 in a gluon distribution function and in a running constant @xmath104 .",
    "the count of a transverse momentum of the bfkl gluons in the @xmath0-factorization approach results in a flattening of the @xmath3-spectrum of the @xmath103 as contrasted by predictions of the parton model . for the first time",
    "this effect was indicated in the ref .",
    "@xcite , and later in the ref .",
    "7 shows the result of our calculation for the @xmath3 spectrum of the @xmath103 mesons . using the @xmath0-factorization approach we have obtained the harder @xmath3-spectrum of the @xmath103 than has been predicted in the lo parton model .",
    "it is visible that at large values of @xmath3 only the @xmath0-factorization approach gives correct description of the data @xcite .",
    "however , it is impossible to consider this visible effect as a direct indication on nontrivial developments of the small - x physics . in the article @xcite",
    "was shown that the calculation in the nlo approximation using colliniar parton model gives a harder @xmath3 spectrum of the @xmath103 meson , too , which will agree with the data at the large @xmath3 .    in the @xmath0-factorization approach",
    "jb parameterization @xcite gives @xmath3-spectrum , which is very close to experimental data . from the another hand in the case of js parameterization",
    "@xcite the additional @xmath92-factor approximately equal 2 is needed .",
    "the @xmath6 spectra are shown in fig.8 at the various choice of the @xmath3 cut : @xmath173 , @xmath174 and @xmath175 gev , correspondingly .",
    "the relation between the theoretical predictions and experimental data is the same as in fig.7 .",
    "the @xmath0 factorization approach give more correct description of the data especially at large value of @xmath6 where the curve obtained in the collinear parton model tends to zero .",
    "fig.9 shows the dependence of the total @xmath103 photoproduction cross section on @xmath176 at @xmath177 and @xmath168 gev .",
    "the shape of this dependence agrees well with the result obtained using js parameterization @xcite or kmr @xcite parameterization .",
    "however , the predicted absolute value of the cross section @xmath178 is smaller by factor 2 than obtained data @xcite .",
    "the results of calculation using jb @xcite or grv @xcite parameterizations are larger and coincide with the data @xcite better .",
    "as it was mentioned above , the main difference between the @xmath0-factorization approach and the conventional parton model is nontrivial polarization of the bfkl gluon .",
    "it is obvious , that such a spin condition of the initial gluon should result in observed spin effects during the birth of the polarized @xmath103 meson .",
    "we have performed calculations for the spin parameter @xmath108 as a function @xmath6 or @xmath3 in the conventional parton model and in the @xmath0-factorization approach : @xmath179 here @xmath180 is the total @xmath103 production cross section , @xmath181 is the production cross section for the longitudinal polarized @xmath103 mesons , @xmath182 is the production cross section for the transverse polarized @xmath103 mesons .",
    "the parameter @xmath108 controls the angle distribution for leptons in the decay @xmath183 in the @xmath103 meson rest frame : @xmath184    the theoretical results for the parameter @xmath185 are very close to each other irrespective of the choice of an approach or a gluon parameterization @xcite .    for the parameter @xmath186",
    "we have found strongly opposite predictions in the parton model and in the @xmath0-factorization approach , as it is visible in fig .",
    "the parton model predicts that @xmath103 mesons should have transverse polarizations at the large @xmath3 ( @xmath187 at the @xmath188 gev ) , but @xmath0-factorization approach predicts that @xmath103 mesons should be longitudinally polarized ( @xmath189 at the @xmath188 gev ) .",
    "the experimental points lie in the range @xmath190 gev and they have the large errors .",
    "however , it is visible that @xmath7 decrease as @xmath3 changes from 1 to 5 gev .",
    "this fact coincide with theoretical prediction obtained in the @xmath0-factorization approach .",
    "nowadays , a result of the nlo parton model calculation in the case of the polarized @xmath103 meson photoproduction is unknown .",
    "it should be an interesting subject of future investigations .",
    "if the count of the nlo corrections will not change predictions of the lo parton model for @xmath186 , the experimental measurement of this spin effect will be a direct signal about bfkl gluon dynamics .    nowadays , the experimental data on @xmath103 polarization in photoproduction at large @xmath3 are absent .",
    "however there are similar data from cdf collaboration @xcite , where @xmath103 and @xmath191 @xmath3-spectra and polarizations have been measured .",
    "opposite the case of @xmath103 photoproduction , the hadroproduction data needs to take into account the large color - octet contribution in order to explain @xmath103 and @xmath191 production at tevatron in the conventional collinear parton model . the relative weight of color - octet contribution may be smaller if we use @xmath0-factorization approach , as was shown recently in @xcite .",
    "the predicted using collinear parton model transverse polarization of @xmath103 at large @xmath3 is not supported by the cdf data , which can be roughly explained by the @xmath0-factorization approach @xcite . in conclusion ,",
    "the number of theoretical uncertainties in the case of @xmath103 meson hadroproduction is much more than in the case of photoproduction and they need more complicated investigation , which is why the future experimental analysis of @xmath103 photoproduction at thera will be clean check of the collinear parton model and the @xmath0-factorization approach .",
