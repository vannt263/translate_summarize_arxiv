    "the purpose of this article is to give a geometrical generalization of the following classical routh s theorem , see p.82 of @xcite .",

    "denote by @xmath11 the point of intersection of lines @xmath12 and @xmath13 , by @xmath14 the point of intersection of lines @xmath15 and @xmath12 , and by @xmath16 the point of intersection of lines @xmath13 and @xmath15 - see figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "then the area of the triangle @xmath17 is @xmath18 and the area of the triangle @xmath19 is @xmath20    as a consequence of the routh s theorem we have the following ceva s theorem .",
    "the lines @xmath12 , @xmath15 and @xmath13 intersect at one point if and only if @xmath21 .",
    "our goal is to establish a three - dimensional analogue of routh s theorem .",
    "let us start with an arbitrary tetrahedron @xmath22 of volume @xmath1 .",
    "choose a point @xmath6 on the line segment @xmath7 and cut the tetrahedron @xmath22 by the plane @xmath23 as displayed on figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "next we construct three additional cutting planes : the plane containing the edge @xmath7 and a point @xmath2 on the edge @xmath24 , the plane containing the edge @xmath3 and a point @xmath4 on the edge @xmath25 , and the plane containing the edge @xmath26 and a point @xmath27 on the edge @xmath3 .",
    "this way the points @xmath28 lie on the edges of the cycle @xmath29 .",
    "all four cutting planes and their intersections are depicted on figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "we will write @xmath30 for the volume of a tetrahedron @xmath22 and use analogous notation for volumes of other tetrahedra . referring to figure [ fig3 ] , here",
    "is our main result , routh s theorem for tetrahedra :    [ tetra ] let @xmath22 be an arbitrary tetrahedron of volume @xmath1 . choose a point @xmath6 on the edge @xmath7 , a point @xmath27 on the edge @xmath3 , a point @xmath2 on the edge @xmath24 , and a point @xmath4 on the edge @xmath25 such that @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 . then @xmath35    the four planes given by the points @xmath36 , points @xmath37 , points @xmath38 , and points @xmath39 enclose a tetrahedron @xmath40 of the volume    @xmath41    it is clear that theorem [ tetra ] implies the following menelaus theorem for tetrahedra .",
    "the points @xmath42 in theorem [ tetra ] are coplanar if and only if @xmath43 .    as another consequence of theorem [ tetra ]",
    "we obtain the analogue of ceva s theorem .",
    "the four planes given by points @xmath36 , points @xmath37 , points @xmath38 and points @xmath39 as in theorem [ tetra ] intersect at one point if and only if @xmath43 .",
    "the statement of routh s theorem first appeared in the book @xcite , p.82 .",
    "different proofs of routh s theorem for triangles were given in papers @xcite .",
    "it is rather suprising that , after an extensive search of the literature , we did not find any geometric proof generalizing this classical theorem from plane geometry that would cover tetrahedra , the three - dimensional analogues of triangles .",
    "the only references we have found are the papers @xcite , where formulas generalizing routh s theorem to higher dimensions are obtained by means of the vector analysis .",
    "the paper @xcite seems to be the first work showing formulas for the volumes of both tetrahedra in theorem [ tetra ] .",
    "the notation of @xcite follows that of the paper @xcite and an earlier work @xcite , and the reader needs to adjust it to the notation used in the present article .",
    "it is rather unfortunate that paper @xcite is written in slovak and paper @xcite in chinese language which makes them inaccessible for most readers .",
    "in fact , we did not know about these papers before we obtained main results of this article .    we intent to give a more thorough review of the literature related to generalizations of theorems of routh , ceva , and menelaus in our forthcoming paper that starts with the geometry of tetrahedra and",
    "leads to an algebraic formula related to cycles of length @xmath44 that is interesting on its own even without the relationship to the routh s theorem .",
    "it was already observed in @xcite that if the points @xmath42 are coplanar , then @xmath43 .",
    "this is the only case when @xmath45 . by examining figure",
    "[ fig3 ] , one can notice that the vertices @xmath11 and @xmath16 of the tetrahedron @xmath40 lie on the line @xmath46 while the vertices @xmath47 and @xmath14 lie on the line @xmath48 . since this implies that @xmath45 if and only if @xmath49 , we also conclude that @xmath49 only when @xmath43 .",
    "note also that when we fix , for example , @xmath50 and @xmath51 and let @xmath52 increase starting at @xmath53 , the product @xmath54 also increases starting at @xmath53 , so the value @xmath43 occurs when the point @xmath2 moves from @xmath55 to @xmath56 .",
    "thus , before this occurrence , the points @xmath16 and @xmath55 belong to the same halfspace determined by the plane passing through the points @xmath57 and @xmath47 .",
    "this observation suggests that figure [ fig3 ] corresponds to the case where @xmath58 . in what follows",
    "we assume that , in theorem [ tetra ] , @xmath58 and derive formulas for the volumes of tetrahedra @xmath59 and @xmath40 .",
    "after that is done , we extend the formulas to the case @xmath60 by changing the orientation and applying a suitable substitution of the parameters @xmath61 .",
    "assume first that @xmath58 and refer to figure [ fig4 ] .    , height=336 ]    the following lemma will be used repetitively , often without explicit reference .",
    "[ lm1 ] in the notation of figure [ fig2 ] , we have @xmath62    we will also utilize the following consequence of lemma [ lm1 ] on a number of occasions .    [ l15 ] in the notation of figure [ fig5 ] ,        we have @xmath63    referring to figure [ fig4 ] , the tetrahedron @xmath22 contains seven smaller tetrahedra @xmath59 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 .    the critical observation that @xmath70 can be seen from figures [ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] .            by lemma [ l15 ] , we have @xmath71 @xmath72 applying lemma [ l15 ] in the second step of each of the following four calculations , we obtain @xmath73 @xmath74 @xmath75 @xmath76    therefore equation ( [ e0 ] ) yields @xmath77    assume now that @xmath60 . in order to reduce this case to the case @xmath58 , we can put the tetrahedron @xmath22 into a different perspective , namely , let us place the vertex @xmath56 at the original position of the vertex @xmath78 and run the edge @xmath79 along the original edge @xmath5 , in the same direction .",
    "if we now consider the cycle @xmath80 instead of the original cycle @xmath29 , the parameters @xmath61 switch to @xmath81 , respectively .",
    "since @xmath82 , we can apply the previous formula which yields @xmath83",
    "now we proceed to compute the volume of the smaller tetrahedron @xmath40 , carved up inside the original tetrahedron @xmath22 by the four cutting planes described earlier . assuming again @xmath58 and using the notation of figure [ fig8 ] ,                                  lemma [ lm3 ] applied to the triangle @xmath0 gives @xmath101 another application of lemma [ lm3 ] ,",
    "now to triangle @xmath23 , yields @xmath102 using these we derive @xmath103 and @xmath104 therefore @xmath105 similarly , @xmath106 and @xmath107    lemma [ lm3 ] applied to the triangle @xmath108 gives @xmath109 hence @xmath110 lemma [ lm3 ] applied to the triangle @xmath111 yields @xmath112 and therefore @xmath113 thus @xmath114 proceeding as before , we have @xmath115 where @xmath116    lemma [ lm3 ] applied to the triangle @xmath117 implies @xmath118 and this gives @xmath119 also , lemma [ lm3 ] applied to the triangle @xmath120 gives @xmath121 now , applied to the triangle @xmath120 , lemma [ lm3 ] yields @xmath122 and we derive @xmath123 therefore @xmath124 finally , @xmath125 and @xmath126"
