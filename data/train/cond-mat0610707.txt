    "the kondo effect in quantum dots ( qds ) has been extensively studied in the last years @xcite .",
    "the qds allow studying systematically the quantum - coherence many - body kondo state , due to the possibility of continuous tuning the relevant parameters governing the properties of this state , in equilibrium and nonequilibrium situations . recently",
    "kondo effect has been studied in side attach quantum dot @xcite and parallel quantum dots @xcite .",
    "recent electron transport experiments showed that kondo and fano resonances occur simultaneously @xcite .",
    "multiple scattering of traveling electronic waves on a localized magnetic state are crucial for the formation of both resonances .",
    "the condition for the fano resonance is the existence of two scattering channels : a discrete level and a broad continuum band @xcite .",
    "an alternative configuration consists of two single qds side attached to a perfect quantum wire ( qw ) .",
    "this structure is reminiscent of the cross - bar - shaped quantum wave guides @xcite . in this case , the qds act as scattering centers in close analogy with the traditional kondo effect @xcite .",

    "in this work we study the transport properties of two single quantum dots side coupled to a quantum wire in the kondo regime .",
    "we use the finite-@xmath0 slave boson mean - field approach , which was initially developed by kotliar and ruckenstein @xcite and used later by bing dong and x. l. lei to study the transport through coupled double quantum dots connected to leads @xcite.this approach enforces the correspondence between the impurity fermions and the auxiliary bosons to a mean - field level to release the @xmath1 restriction . in quantum dots ,",
    "this approach allows to treat the dot - lead coupling nonperturbatively for an arbitrary strength of the coulomb interaction @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "we have found that the transmission spectrum shows a structure with two anti - resonances localized at the renormalized energies of the quantum dots .",
    "the dos of the system shows that when the kondo correlations are dominant there are two kondo regimes each with its own kondo temperature .",
    "the above behavior of the dos can be explained by quantum interference in the transmission through the two different resonance states of the quantum dots coupled to common lead .",
    "this phenomenon is in analogy to the dicke effect in quantum optics , that takes place in the spontaneous emission of two closely - lying atoms radiating a photon into the same environment  @xcite . in the electronic case , however , the decay rates ( level broadening ) are produced by the indirect coupling of the up - down qds , giving rise to a fast ( _ superradiant _ ) and a slow ( _ subradiant _ ) mode .",
