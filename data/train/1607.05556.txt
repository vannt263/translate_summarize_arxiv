    "origin of non - zero neutrino masses and large leptonic mixing @xcite has been one of the longstanding puzzles in particle physics .",
    "although the 2012 discovery of the higgs boson at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) has confirmed the validity of the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics , the model however fails to account for the observations in the neutrino sector .",
    "this has given rise to several beyond standard model ( bsm ) physics proposals that can generate non - zero neutrino masses and mixing , in agreement with experimental observations .",
    "the @xmath6 global fit values of neutrino oscillation parameters that have appeared in the recent analysis of @xcite and @xcite are shown in table [ tab : data1 ] .",
    ".global fit @xmath6 values of neutrino oscillation parameters @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for the field content in table [ table1 ] , one can write down the corresponding superpotential similar to the way it was done in the original altarelli - feruglio model @xcite . here",
    "we show write down the corresponding superpotential and derive the light neutrino mass matrix .",
    "it is straightforward to write down the superpotential as @xmath7 the above superpotential , apart from being invariant under the mssm gauge symmetry as well as @xmath8 discrete symmetry also has an approximate global symmetry @xmath9 .",
    "since continuous global symmetries lead to phenomenologically unacceptable massless goldstone bosons after spontaneous symmetry breaking , we break this symmetry softly by the mass term @xmath10 of sterile neutrino by one unit .",
    "thus , @xmath11 can be naturally small ( of ev scale , say ) as @xmath12 recovers the full @xmath9 global symmetry of the superpotential .",
    "one can also extend it to @xmath9 gauge symmetry by introducing additional fields required for anomaly cancelation , which we do not pursue here and stick to this minimal structure of an illustrative toy model . as shown in @xcite ,",
    "the vacuum alignments @xmath13 give rise to a diagonal charged lepton mass matrix and a @xmath1 symmetric @xmath0 active neutrino mass matrix .",
    "this @xmath1 symmetric @xmath0 has a structure @xmath14 where @xmath15 .",
    "the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of @xmath16 is denoted by @xmath17 .",
    "this form of the mass matrix can be easily derived by using the @xmath3 product rules given in appendix [ appen2 ] with the above choice of vacuum alignments .",
    "this particular @xmath1 symmetric active neutrino mass matrix gives rise to the tbm mixing pattern discussed before .",
    "now , due to the presence of additional terms in the superpotential involving the sterile neutrino @xmath18 , the light neutrino mass matrix is @xmath19 having the following structure @xmath20 where @xmath21 contains the active - sterile mixing elements . assuming the simple vacuum alignments @xmath22 one can derive these mixing elements as @xmath23 thus , the sterile neutrino sector can break the @xmath1 symmetry if @xmath24 , which is easy to achieve by different choices of dimensionless couplings @xmath25 and singlet vev s @xmath26 .",
    "one can also achieve a @xmath1 symmetry breaking @xmath27 without introducing the singlet flavons @xmath28 if the triplet @xmath29 has a vacuum alignment @xmath30 with @xmath31 .",
    "it should be noted that , additional driving fields are needed to realise the desired vacuum alignment as discussed in @xcite .",
    "since those fields do not affect the general structure of the mass matrices , we have not incorporated them in the discussion of this toy model for illustrative purposes .",
    "in this section , we study the impact of @xmath1 symmetry in the @xmath32 active neutrino mass matrix on the neutrino parameters . unbroken @xmath1 symmetry in the @xmath32 block of the light neutrino mass matrix in @xmath4 framework give rise to additional constraints relating the neutrino parameters . in the diagonal charged lepton basis ,",
    "the diagonalising matrix of the @xmath19 neutrino mass matrix can be identified as the light neutrino mixing matrix .",
    "such a @xmath19 mixing matrix @xmath33 can be parametrised by six mixing angles and three dirac cp phases .",
    "there are three additional majorana cp phases if the light neutrinos are assumed to be of majorana nature .",
    "the @xmath19 unitary mixing matrix can be parametrised as @xcite @xmath34 where the rotation matrices @xmath35 can be further parametrised as ( for example @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) @xmath38 with @xmath39 and @xmath40 being the dirac cp phases whereas @xmath41 contains the three majorana cp phases . using this form of mixing matrix , the @xmath19 light neutrino mass matrix",
    "can be written as @xmath42 with @xmath43 being the diagonal mass matrix . using two",
    "mass squared differences from three neutrino global fit data @xcite , and another from sterile neutrino global fits @xcite , one can write down the light neutrino mass eigenvalues in terms of the lightest neutrino mass . for nh of active neutrinos the heavier neutrino masses can be written as @xmath44 similarly for ih of active neutrinos , the heavier masses can be written as @xmath45 where the lightest neutrino mass is @xmath46 for nh and @xmath47 for ih . using all these ,",
    "we can write down the @xmath19 neutrino mass matrix in terms of sixteen independent parameters : four mass eigenvalues , six mixing angles , three dirac cp phases and three majorana cp phases . the analytical expressions of the elements of this mass matrix are given in appendix [ appen1 ] . by demanding the active neutrino block to preserve this discrete symmetry",
    ", we numerically evaluate the neutrino parameters for two different cases , as discussed below .",
    "+          +          +          +                 +          for the case of general @xmath1 symmetry in the @xmath0 block of the @xmath19 mass matrix , one has the following constraints @xmath48 this is clear from the structure of the mass matrix given in equation .",
    "since the elements of the mass matrix are in general complex quantities , the above two constraints give rise to four real equations .",
    "these four coupled equations can be solved simultaneously to identify the @xmath4 neutrino parameter space that respects this general @xmath1 symmetric @xmath0 block of the @xmath19 mass matrix .",
    "we use the global fit @xmath6 values three active neutrino mixing angles , two mass squared differences from @xcite , the active - sterile mass squared difference @xmath49 ( nh ) , @xmath50 ( ih ) from @xcite . since the leptonic cp phases are not known yet , we vary them in their @xmath6 allowed range @xmath51 .",
    "this leaves us with three active - sterile mixing angles @xmath52 and the lightest neutrino mass @xmath53 as unknown parameters .",
    "they can be evaluated numerically by solving the four constraint equations mentioned above .      for the light neutrino mass matrix with @xmath1 symmetry in the @xmath0 block discussed within a minimal @xmath3 flavour model in section [ sec2 ] ,",
    "it is straightforward to see that there are more constraints relating the mass matrix elements than in the general case discussed above .",
    "these constraints are @xmath54 it is straightforward to realise these constraint equations from the structure of the mass matrix given in equation .",
    "these four complex constraints give rise to eight real constraint equations relating the sixteen neutrino parameters within a @xmath4 framework discussed above .",
    "we use @xmath6 global fit values of five mixing angles @xmath55 and three mass squared differences leaving eight unknown parameters : six cp phases , one mixing angle @xmath56 and the lightest neutrino mass @xmath57 .",
    "these eight parameters are determined by solving the eight constraints mentioned above .",
    "if neutrinos are majorana fermions , lepton number is violated giving rise to a non - zero amplitude of neutrinoless double beta decay .",
    "@xmath59 is a process where a heavier nucleus decays into a lighter one and two electrons @xmath60 without any neutrinos in the final state . for a review on @xmath59",
    ", please refer to @xcite .",
    "the contribution of light neutrinos in the sm to the amplitude of @xmath59 remain suppressed much below the sensitivity of ongoing experiments @xcite unless the lightest neutrino mass falls in the quasi - degenerate regime , which is already in tension with the planck data @xcite . in the presence of a light sterile neutrino with non - trivial mixing with active neutrinos",
    ", one can have sizeable contributions to the @xmath59 amplitude even if the lightest neutrino mass is much smaller than the quasi degenerate limit .",
    "some earlier works on light sterile neutrino contributions to @xmath59 can be found in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath59 amplitude corresponding to the light neutrino contribution can be written as @xmath61 with @xmath62 mev being the average momentum exchange for the process . in the above expression ,",
    "@xmath63 are the masses of light neutrinos for @xmath64 whereas @xmath65 is the fermi coupling constant and @xmath33 is the light neutrino mixing matrix .",
    "thus , the light neutrino contribution can be written in terms of @xmath66 which is a function of mixing angles @xmath67 , majorana cp phases @xmath68 and four mass eigenvalues @xmath69 as shown in appendix [ appen1 ] . using the numerically evaluated neutrino parameters for the two cases discussed above",
    ", one can calculate the numerical value of @xmath70 and compare against the most recent kamland - zen results , according to which the upper bound on @xmath71 is ( 0.06 - 0.16 ) ev at @xmath72 c.l . @xcite .",
    "we have studied the possibility of generating non - zero @xmath2 by breaking @xmath1 symmetry only in the sterile neutrino sector , while keeping it unbroken in the @xmath0 active neutrino mass matrix . in a scenario with three active and one light sterile neutrino",
    ", the @xmath19 mass matrix with @xmath1 symmetric @xmath0 active neutrino block can give rise to correct neutrino oscillation data provided the @xmath1 symmetry is broken in the sterile neutrino sector due to the inequality @xmath73 .",
    "considering such a mass matrix to have a general structure as well as the one within a minimal @xmath3 flavour model , we numerically evaluate the full parameter space that can give rise to such a mass matrix . in the general case ( denoted as case i in the previous section ) , the three active - sterile mixing angles generated from the constraint equations along with the lightest neutrino mass are shown in figures [ fig1 ] , [ fig2 ] for nh and ih respectively .",
    "it is interesting to note from the first three panels of these two figures that even if the present experiments @xcite completely rule out the light sterile neutrino parameter space suggested by @xcite in order to explain the neutrino anomalies discussed before , the present framework of generating non - zero reactor mixing angle can still survive .",
    "this is due to the fact that very small values of active - sterile mixing angles ( not excluded by present experiments ) are also consistent with correct neutrino oscillation data in the active sector .",
    "the last panel of these two figures [ fig1 ] , [ fig2 ] show the extent of @xmath1 symmetry breaking @xmath74 required to generate correct neutrino oscillation data .",
    "we repeat the same calculation for case ii that is , the minimal @xmath3 model discussed above . the plots in figures [ fig3 ] , [ fig4 ]",
    "show the relevant parameter space in active - sterile mixing angles , lightest neutrino mass for nh and ih respectively .",
    "similar to the general case , the last panel of figures [ fig3 ] , [ fig4 ] show the required deviation from @xmath1 symmetry in the sterile neutrino sector .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows some interesting correlations between the cp phases in case ii .",
    "we also calculate the effective neutrino mass @xmath75 in order to check the implications of the neutrino parameters evaluated above for neutrinoless double beta decay .",
    "the corresponding values of @xmath76 are shown as a function of lightest neutrino mass @xmath57 for both case i , ii as well as nh , ih in figure [ fig6 ] .",
    "it is interesting to note from these figures that the latest kamland - zen bound @xcite already rules out a small part of parameter space .",
    "an order of amplitude improvement in these experimental searches for @xmath59 will in fact rule out three of the scenarios discussed in this work .",
    "only the general @xmath1 symmetric case with nh will survive in that case , as it has some parameter space which predicts very small values of @xmath76 , way below the present sensitivity of kamland - zen experiment .    to summarise ,",
    "we have evaluated the @xmath4 neutrino parameter space obeying a discrete @xmath1 symmetry in the @xmath0 block of the @xmath19 neutrino mass matrix which is in agreement with the current neutrino data .",
    "such a symmetric active neutrino block of the @xmath19 mass matrix restrict the neutrino parameter space to some specific values , satisfying the constraints imposed by the @xmath1 symmetry , both in general as well as in the minimal @xmath3 model .",
    "this constrained parameter space can have interesting implications at oscillation as well as neutrinoless double beta decay experiments .",
    "we found that , correct active neutrino oscillation data can be generated for a @xmath1 symmetric @xmath0 active neutrino block within a @xmath19 mass matrix , even if the active - sterile mixing angles are smaller than the ones required by lsnd , miniboone and other neutrino data showing anomalies .",
    "this is interesting in the light of ongoing experiments @xcite which are claiming to rule out most part of parameter space required to explain the neutrino anomalies .",
    "although neutrino experiments may not be able to rule out these scenarios ( where non - zero @xmath2 originates from @xmath1 symmetry breaking only in the sterile sector ) in near future , an order of magnitude improvement in @xmath59 sensitivity should be able to rule out most of these models except a general @xmath1 symmetric case with normal hierarchy as discussed above .",
    "these scenarios could also shed more light into the fundamental symmetries behind the origin of leptonic mixing , similar to the particular example of @xmath3 symmetric model discussed in this work .",
    "@xmath3 , the symmetry group of a tetrahedron , is a discrete non - abelian group of even permutations of four objects .",
    "it has four irreducible representations : three one - dimensional and one three dimensional which are denoted by @xmath77 and @xmath78 respectively , being consistent with the sum of square of the dimensions @xmath79 .",
    "their product rules are given as @xmath80 @xmath81 @xmath82 @xmath83 @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 in the subscript corresponds to anti - symmetric and symmetric parts respectively .",
    "denoting two triplets as @xmath87 and @xmath88 respectively , their direct product can be decomposed into the direct sum mentioned above as @xmath89 @xmath90 @xmath91 @xmath92 @xmath93",

    "<S> we show that the @xmath0 active neutrino mass matrix can possess a @xmath1 symmetry and can still be consistent with non - zero value of the reactor mixing angle @xmath2 , provided the symmetry is broken in the sterile neutrino sector . </S>",
    "<S> we first propose a simple @xmath3 realisation of such a scenario and then numerically evaluate the complete @xmath4 neutrino parameter space that allows such a possibility . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the possible implications at neutrinoless double beta decay @xmath5 experiments . </S>"
