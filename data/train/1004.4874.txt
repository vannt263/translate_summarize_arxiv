    "einstein , podolsky , and rosen ( epr ) showed that quantum mechanics is incomplete , in the sense that not every element of reality has a counterpart inside the theory @xcite .",
    "epr proposed the following criterion to identify an element of reality : `` if , without in any way disturbing a system , we can predict with certainty ( i.e. , with probability equal to unity ) the value of a physical quantity , then there exists an element of physical reality corresponding to this physical quantity '' @xcite . in practice",
    ", nondisturbance can be guaranteed when the measurements are performed on distant systems .",
    "predictions with certainty are possible for states having perfect correlations .",
    "a quantum state @xmath2 has @xmath3 perfect correlations when there are @xmath3 different observables @xmath4 such that @xmath5 .",
    "thirty years after epr s paper , bell proved that there is a irresoluble conflict between epr s elements of reality and quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "all - versus - nothing ( avn ) proofs are the most direct way to reveal this conflict .",
    "an avn proof is based on a set of @xmath6 perfect correlations of a specific quantum state .",
    "the name `` all - versus - nothing '' @xcite reflects one particular feature of these proofs : if one assumes epr elements of reality , then @xmath7 of these perfect correlations lead to a conclusion that is the opposite of the one obtained from a subset of the other @xmath8 perfect correlations .",
    "if all @xmath6 correlations are essential to obtain a contradiction ( i.e. , if the contradiction vanishes when we remove one of them ) , then the avn proof is said to be critical .",
    "the first avn proof was obtained by heywood and redhead @xcite .",
    "however , the most famous avn proof is greenberger , horne , and zeilinger s ( ghz ) @xcite .",
    "the first bipartite avn proof with qubits is in refs . @xcite .",
    "the first bipartite avn proof with qubits and using only single - qubit measurements is in refs . @xcite .",
    "the interest of the case in which the parties are restricted to perform single - qubit measurements is motivated by the practical difficulty of making general @xmath9-qubit measurements ( @xmath10 ) when the qubits are encoded in different degrees of freedom of the same particle .",
    "recently , several @xmath0-qubit @xmath1-particle states ( @xmath11 ) having perfect correlations have been experimentally prepared , for instance , 4-qubit two - photon @xcite , 6-qubit two - photon @xcite , 6-qubit four - photon @xcite , 8-qubit four - photon @xcite , and 10-qubit five - photon graph states @xcite .    for these @xmath0-qubit @xmath1-particle states ,",
    "a natural problem is the following : consider @xmath1 distant parties ; party @xmath12 can perform single - qubit measurements on particle @xmath12 , particle @xmath12 contains @xmath13 qubits ( @xmath14 ) ; which @xmath0-qubit @xmath1-particle states allow @xmath1-partite avn proofs ?",
    "this problem has been solved for the case of @xmath15 particles / parties @xcite . in this article",
    "we address the problem for an arbitrary number @xmath1 of particles / parties .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] , we show that there is an equivalence between pure states allowing avn proofs and graph states .",
    "this will simplify the task of finding all inequivalent @xmath0-qubit @xmath1-partite avn proofs .",
    "an @xmath1-partite avn proof is specific for an @xmath0-qubit @xmath1-particle graph state when there is no graph state with fewer qubits satisfying the same correlations . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] we discuss the requirements of an @xmath1-partite avn proof to be specific for an @xmath0-qubit @xmath1-particle graph state , and describe a method to decide whether a given @xmath0-qubit @xmath1-particle graph state allows a specific @xmath1-partite avn proof .",
    "we apply this method to decide whether some @xmath0-qubit @xmath1-particle graph states recently prepared in the laboratory allow @xmath1-partite avn proofs . as supplementary material @xcite , we provide a computer program to decide whether a given @xmath0-qubit @xmath1-particle graph state allows a specific @xmath1-partite avn proof .    in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] we solve the following problem : given an @xmath0-qubit graph state , what is the minimum number @xmath1 of parties that allows a specific @xmath1-partite avn proof . as supplementary material",
    "( see footnote 1 ) , we provide a computer program to obtain , given an @xmath0-qubit graph state , all distributions between @xmath1 parties and all distributions between a minimum number of parties which allow avn proofs .",
    "the solution of the previous problem allows us to obtain all inequivalent distributions allowing avn proofs since any distribution obtained from one allowing a specific avn proof by giving qubits that originally belong to the same party to new parties will also allow an avn proof . as supplementary material",
    ", we provide all inequivalent distributions between a minimum number @xmath1 of parties allowing specific @xmath1-partite avn proofs for all @xmath0-qubit graph states of @xmath16 qubits . for all inequivalent distributions between a minimum number @xmath1 of parties allowing specific @xmath1-partite avn proofs for all @xmath0-qubit graph state of @xmath16 qubits . ]",
    "an avn proof requires an @xmath0-qubit quantum state distributed between @xmath1 parties .",
    "this state has a set of perfect correlations between the results of single - qubit measurements .",
    "these correlations must satisfy two requirements .",
    "first , they must allow us to define @xmath1-partite epr s elements of reality .",
    "this means that every single - qubit observable involved in the avn proof must satisfy epr s criterion of elements of reality ( i.e. , its value can be predicted with certainty using only the results of single - qubit measurements on distant particles ) .",
    "second , they must lead to a contradiction when epr s criterion of elements of reality is assumed .",
    "therefore the conclusion of an avn proof is that if the quantum predictions are correct , observables which satisfy epr s condition can not have predefined results since it is impossible to assign them values which simultaneously satisfy the perfect correlations predicted by quantum mechanics .",
    "perfect correlations are necessary to establish elements of reality and to prove that they are incompatible with quantum mechanics . therefore the states which allow avn proofs must be simultaneous eigenstates of a sufficient number of commuting @xmath0-fold tensor products of single - qubit operators . indeed ,",
    "the following observations lead us to the conclusion that without loss of generality , we can restrict our attention to a particular family of states .",
    "two different single - qubit operators @xmath17 and @xmath18 on the same qubit can not commute .",
    "a necessary condition to make @xmath0-fold tensor products be commuting operators is to choose @xmath17 and @xmath18 to be anticommuting operators .",
    "therefore , in an avn proof , all single - qubit operators corresponding to the same qubit must be anticommuting operators .",
    "the maximum number of anticommuting single - qubit operators is three .",
    "therefore , without loss of generality , we can restrict our attention to a specific set of three single - qubit anticommuting operators on each qubit , for example the pauli matrices @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .",
    "this leads us to the concept of stabilizer state .",
    "an @xmath0-qubit stabilizer state is the simultaneous eigenstate with eigenvalue @xmath22 of a set of @xmath0 independent commuting elements of the pauli group ( i.e. , the group , under matrix multiplication , of all @xmath0-fold tensor products of @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and the identity @xmath26 ) .",
    "the @xmath0 independent elements are called stabilizer generators and generate a maximally abelian subgroup , the stabilizer group of the state @xcite . the @xmath27 elements of the stabilizer group are the stabilizing operators and provide all the perfect correlations of the stabilizer state .",
    "a further simplification is possible since any stabilizer state is local clifford equivalent ( i.e. , equivalent under the local unitary operations that map the pauli group to itself under conjugation ) to a graph state @xcite .",
    "therefore the problem of which @xmath0-qubit pure states and distributions of qubits between the parties allow @xmath1-partite avn proofs is reduced to the problem of which @xmath0-qubit graph states and distributions allow @xmath1-partite avn proofs .",
    "a graph state @xcite is a stabilizer state whose generators can be written with the help of a graph .",
    "@xmath28 is the @xmath0-qubit state associated with the graph @xmath29 , which gives a recipe both for preparing @xmath28 and for obtaining @xmath0 stabilizer generators that uniquely determine @xmath28 . on one hand , @xmath29 is a set of @xmath0 vertices ( each representing a qubit ) connected by edges ( each representing an ising interaction between the connected qubits ) . on the other hand , the stabilizer generator @xmath30 is obtained by looking at the vertex @xmath12 of @xmath29 and the set @xmath31 of vertices which are connected to @xmath12 and is defined by @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 denote the pauli matrices acting on the @xmath12th qubit .",
    "@xmath28 is the only @xmath0-qubit state that fulfills @xmath36 therefore the stabilizer group is @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes a subset of @xmath39 .",
    "the stabilizing operators provide all the perfect correlations of @xmath28 : @xmath40 graph states associated with connected graphs have been exhaustively classified .",
    "there is only 1 two - qubit graph state ( equivalent to a bell state ) , only 1 three - qubit graph state ( equivalent to a ghz state ) , and 2 four - qubit graph states ( equivalent to a ghz and a cluster state ) , 4 five - qubit graph states , 11 six - qubit graph states , 26 seven - qubit graph states @xcite , and 101 eight - qubit graph states @xcite .",
    "the perfect correlations of any graph state associated with a connected graph of three or more vertices lead to contradictions with the concept of elements of reality when each qubit is distributed to a different party @xcite .",
    "however , the first problem consists of finding whether these contradictions are specific to a given distribution of a graph state or , on the contrary , they can be obtained with a graph state of fewer qubits .",
    "for example , take the four - party avn proof based on the following four perfect correlations of the distribution of the four - qubit fully connected graph state @xmath41 ( a four - qubit ghz state ) in which each qubit belongs to a different party :    @xmath42    this is an example of an avn proof which is nonspecific for the state @xmath41 , the reason being that neither the contradiction nor the definition of the elements of reality involved in this contradiction requires any choice from the party which has the fourth qubit .",
    "this party only has to measure @xmath43 and broadcast the result .",
    "the only role of the result of @xmath43 is to guarantee that @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 are elements of reality in a four - party scenario .",
    "however , the contradiction occurs for any result of @xmath43 .",
    "it occurs because the following equations can not be simultaneously satisfied : @xmath50 the particular value of @xmath43 is irrelevant .",
    "the same contradiction can be obtained using the perfect correlations of a three - qubit fully connected graph state @xmath51 ( a three - qubit ghz state ) distributed between three parties .",
    "the next example illustrates that whether an avn proof is specific can depend on the way in which the qubits are distributed between the parties .",
    "consider the avn proof based on the following four correlations of the four - qubit linear cluster state @xmath52 associated with the graph where qubit @xmath22 is connected to qubit @xmath53 , which is connected to qubit @xmath54 , which is connected to qubit @xmath55 :    @xmath56    if the qubits are distributed so that each qubit goes to a different party , then the avn proof is not specific since the party who has the fourth qubit does not need to make any choice , neither for the contradiction nor for the definition of the elements of reality .",
    "the contradiction @xmath57 can be obtained from the perfect correlations of a three - qubit linear cluster state @xmath58 associated with the graph where qubit @xmath22 is connected to qubit @xmath53 , which is connected to qubit @xmath54 .    however , if qubits @xmath22 and @xmath55 belong to alice , and qubits @xmath53 and @xmath54 belong to bob , then the only way to guarantee that , for example , @xmath46 is an element of reality in this scenario ( i.e. , that its result can be predicted using only the results of measurements on alice s side ) is by using the following perfect correlation of the @xmath52 : @xmath59 therefore the party who has qubit @xmath55 must choose between at least two measurements . to sum up",
    ", an avn proof is specific for a given distribution of a graph state when at least two observables of all the qubits are involved .",
    "since the additional correlations needed to define the elements of reality can ( together with those already used for the contradiction ) involve additional contradictions , it is appropriate that the observables needed to guarantee that other observables are elements of reality ( like @xmath60 and @xmath43 in the previous example ) are themselves elements of reality . therefore hereinafter we will focus on avn proofs in which at least two of the observables of all the qubits are elements of reality .",
    "it can be easily seen that when two pauli observables , for example , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , are elements of reality , then the third pauli observable , @xmath35 , is also an element of reality .",
    "therefore we shall focus only on those graph states and distributions in which the three pauli observables of each and every one of the qubits are elements of reality .",
    "the next problem is , given a distribution of an @xmath0-qubit graph state between @xmath1 parties , how to decide whether it is one in which all single - qubit pauli observables are elements of reality .",
    "for that purpose , it is useful to note that the @xmath27 perfect correlations ( i.e. , stabilizing operators ) of an @xmath0-qubit graph state can be classified in four classes :    \\1 .",
    "there are @xmath61 stabilizing operators ( i.e. , a quarter of the stabilizing operators of the graph state ) that allow us to predict @xmath33 from the results of measurements on other qubits : those that are products of the stabilizer generator @xmath30 [ defined in eq .",
    "( [ grule ] ) ] , an even number ( hereinafter `` even '' includes zero ) of @xmath62 with @xmath63 , and an arbitrary number ( hereinafter `` arbitrary number '' includes zero ) of @xmath64 with @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "there are @xmath61 stabilizing operators that allow us to predict @xmath34 from the results of measurements on other qubits : those that are products of @xmath30 , an odd number of @xmath62 with @xmath67 , and an arbitrary number of @xmath64 with @xmath65 and @xmath68 .",
    "there are @xmath61 stabilizing operators that allow us to predict @xmath35 from the results of measurements on other qubits : those that are products of an odd number of @xmath62 with @xmath63 and an arbitrary number of @xmath64 with @xmath65 and @xmath69 .",
    "there are @xmath61 stabilizing operators that contain @xmath70 : those that are products of an even number of @xmath62 with @xmath67 and an arbitrary number of @xmath64 with @xmath65 and @xmath68 .",
    "each particle can carry more than one qubit .",
    "it is therefore convenient to denote as @xmath71 the set of qubits which are in the same particle as qubit @xmath12 .",
    "the previous classification of the stabilizing operators is useful in the following sense : given the distribution of an @xmath0-qubit graph state between @xmath1 parties , @xmath33 is an element of reality if and only if there exists a stabilizing operator of the graph state which satisfies the following two requirements : ( 1 ) it does not contain @xmath62 for all @xmath72 but contains an even number of @xmath64 with @xmath73 and ( 2 ) it contains @xmath30 and an even number of @xmath74 with @xmath75 .",
    "for instance , consider the four - qubit linear cluster state @xmath52 associated with the graph where qubit @xmath22 is connected to qubit @xmath53 , which is connected to qubit @xmath54 , which is connected to qubit @xmath55 , distributed such that alice has qubits 1 and 4 and bob has qubits 2 and 3 .",
    "the question is , is @xmath44 an element of reality ?",
    "this is equivalent to the question , is there a stabilizing operator such that it does not contain @xmath76 [ since @xmath77 but contains an even number ( necessarily zero ) of @xmath78 [ since @xmath79 and @xmath80 and an even number ( necessarily zero ) of @xmath81 [ since @xmath82 ?",
    "the answer is yes ; the only stabilizing operator with these properties is @xmath83 .",
    "similarly , @xmath34 is an element of reality if and only if there is a stabilizing operator satisfying ( 1 ) and the following condition : ( 3 ) it contains @xmath30 and an odd number of @xmath74 with @xmath75 .    finally , @xmath35 is an element of reality if and only if there is a stabilizing operator satisfying ( 1 ) and the following condition : ( 4 ) it does not contain @xmath30 but contains an odd number of @xmath74 with @xmath75 .    to decide whether a specific distribution allows a specific avn proof , we first focus on qubit @xmath12 and test whether @xmath33 and @xmath34 are elements of reality .",
    "if either is not an element of reality , then the distribution does not allow a specific avn proof .",
    "if both are elements of reality , then we test whether @xmath84 and @xmath85 of qubit @xmath86 are elements of reality , and so on for all the qubits .",
    "if all @xmath33 and @xmath34 are elements of reality , then the distribution allows a specific avn proof .    indeed , there are simple cases where it can easily be seen that a distribution does not allow an avn proof .",
    "for example , if more than @xmath87 qubits are carried by the same particle , for qubits of the particle with more than @xmath87 qubits , either requirement ( 1 ) is incompatible with ( 2 ) , or ( 1 ) is incompatible with ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) .",
    "an alternative proof will be provided in sec .  [ sec:4 ] . if there is a qubit @xmath12 such that @xmath88 ( i.e. , if in the graph representing the state , qubit @xmath12 is connected only to qubits of the same particle ) , requirement ( 1 ) is incompatible with requirements ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) .",
    "as supplementary material ( see footnote 1 ) , we provide a computer program to decide whether a given @xmath0-qubit @xmath1-particle graph state allows a specific @xmath1-partite avn proof .      as an example of the application of these rules , it is interesting to discuss whether some recently prepared 6-qubit two- and four - particle states allow specific avn proofs , assuming the natural scenario in which each party has one particle",
