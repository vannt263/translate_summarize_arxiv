    "the @xmath0 resonance is a negative parity baryon resonance with spin 1/2 , isospin @xmath3 and strangeness @xmath4 .",
    "the resonance is located slightly below the @xmath2 threshold and decays into the @xmath1 channel through the strong interaction .",
    "the existence of @xmath0 was theoretically predicted in 1959 by dalitz and tuan  @xcite , based on the analysis of the experimental data of the @xmath2 scattering length .",
    "it is shown that the unitarity in coupled - channel @xmath2-@xmath1 system leads to a resonance pole in the @xmath1 amplitude .",
    "an experimental evidence of this resonance was reported as early as 1961 in the invariant mass spectrum of the @xmath1 channel in the @xmath5 reaction at 1.15 gev  @xcite .",
    "after a half century , @xmath0 has been well established experimentally and is currently listed as a four - star resonance in the table of the particle data group ( pdg )  . in recent years , the structure of @xmath0 has been found to be important in various aspects in the strangeness sector of nonperturbative qcd . at the same time ,",
    "the experimental information on @xmath0 is being rapidly improved by new data , such as the @xmath1 mass spectra in several reactions and the precise measurement of the energy level of the kaonic hydrogen .",
    "thus , it is an important and urgent issue to understand the nature of the @xmath0 resonance .",
    "there is a long - standing discussion on the interpretation of the @xmath0 resonance .",
    "it is known to be difficult to describe @xmath0 as an ordinary three - quark state in simple constituent quark models  @xcite , because @xmath0 has a lighter mass than the nucleon counterpart , the @xmath6 resonance . moreover , the mass difference from the @xmath7 resonance with @xmath8 , which is supposed to be the spin - orbit partner of @xmath0 , is too large in comparison with the splitting in the nucleon sector . according to these difficulties of the simple three - quark picture ,",
    "the meson - baryon quasi - bound picture of @xmath0 attracts much attention .",
    "in fact , the @xmath0 resonance can be naturally described as a quasi - bound @xmath2 state embedded in the @xmath1 continuum in coupled - channel meson - baryon scattering models , for instance , by the phenomenological vector - meson exchange potential with flavor su(3 ) symmetry  @xcite .",
    "strictly speaking , the meson - baryon picture of @xmath0 bears a complementary relationship to the three - quark picture . in reality",
    ", the physical @xmath0 resonance should be a mixture of both ( and with even more exotic structures ) , since all possible components with the same quantum number can mix with each other through the strong interaction .",
    "it is however meaningful to ask the dominant component in @xmath0 , for the understanding of its physical origin and the implication to the @xmath2 dynamics .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss the nature of the @xmath0 resonance based on the coupled - channel framework with chiral symmetry ( chiral unitary approach ) which combines the low energy interaction governed by chiral symmetry and the unitarity condition for the coupled - channel scattering amplitude  @xcite .",
    "this model successfully reproduces the observables in meson - baryon scattering and resonances are dynamically generated in the non - perturbative resummation of the interaction , along the same line with the phenomenological coupled - channel model  @xcite .",
    "not only the successful description of data , chiral unitary approach serves as a useful tool to investigate the structure of the resonances .",
    "the intensive studies of the @xmath0 resonance reveal the peculiar pole structure in the complex energy plane  @xcite , the meson - baryon nature of the resonance  @xcite , the quark structure of the resonance  @xcite , and the spatial size of the resonance state  @xcite .",
    "in addition , chiral unitary approach provides a unique baseline for various applications in low energy qcd . turning to the strangeness nuclear physics , one of the central issues is the study of the possible bound state of the antikaon in nuclei , the @xmath9 nuclei .",
    "based on the @xmath2 quasi - bound picture for @xmath0 , the @xmath9 nuclei was suggested to exhibit various interesting phenomena  @xcite .",
    "the interaction of the antikaon and the nucleon is a basic building block of the study of such multi - hadron systems with antikaons .",
    "traditionally , the @xmath9 nuclei has been studied by phenomenological approaches , where the connection with the underlying theory of qcd is not very much clear . at this point",
    "it is instructive to recall that the antikaon can be regarded as a flavor partner of the pion , which is the nambu - goldstone ( ng ) boson associated with the spontaneous breakdown of chiral su(3)@xmath10su(3)@xmath11symmetry in qcd .",
    "chiral unitary approach can shed light on this aspect of the @xmath2 interaction  @xcite , treating the non - perturbative dynamics of the strong attraction in the @xmath2 channel and its consequence for @xmath0 .",
    "such an approach is indispensable to discuss , for instance , the effect of the partial restoration of chiral symmetry on the dynamics of the @xmath9 in nuclear medium .",
    "the @xmath0 resonance in the meson - baryon picture can be a good candidate of the hadronic molecular state , in which the hadrons are loosely bound by the inter - hadron interaction  @xcite .",
    "this is because the antikaon is moderately heavy , and strongly interacts with the nucleon .",
    "the binding energy of @xmath0 , when regarded as a @xmath2 bound state , is much smaller than the mass scale of the hadrons , so the antikaon and the nucleon will behave as constituents by keeping their identities in @xmath0 .",
    "compared with the quark excitation inside hadrons , the hadronic molecular structure is expected to have a larger spatial size .",
    "physics of the hadronic molecular state is also related to the exotic hadrons and multi - quark states recently observed in heavy quark sector  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we overview the current status of experimental investigations and theoretical studies of @xmath0 .",
    "section  [ sec : chiralunitary ] introduces the chiral unitary approach in detail from the basic framework .",
    "several recent findings on the nature of the structure of @xmath0 in chiral unitary approach are summarized in section  [ sec : structurel1405 ] .",
    "we then discuss the properties of @xmath0 in various environments in section  [ sec : l1405many ] where hadronic molecular states emerge in the few - body systems .",
    "the last section is devoted to conclusion of this paper and the future perspective on the studies of @xmath0 .",
    "here we first go through the experimental investigations of the @xmath1 spectrum where the resonance peak of @xmath0 is observed .",
    "the information on the low energy @xmath12 scattering data is also presented .",
    "we then summarize typical theoretical studies on @xmath0 in the three - quark picture and in the meson - baryon picture .",
    "the @xmath0 resonance exclusively decays into the @xmath13 channel _ via _ strong interaction .",
    "since it is very hard to perform the scattering experiment in the @xmath1 channel directly , the properties of the resonance have been extracted by analyzing the invariant mass distribution of the @xmath1 final state in production experiments .",
    "initiated by ref .",
    "@xcite , several bubble chamber experiments with hadron induced reactions found the evidence for @xmath0 in the energy region @xmath14-@xmath15 mev ( a list of early references can be found in pdg  ) . among others ,",
    "it is worth mentioning that braun _",
    "_ studied the @xmath16 spectrum in @xmath17 reaction  @xcite where the resonance energy was found at 1420 mev .",
    "the @xmath18 spectrum in the pion induced reaction ( @xmath19 ) at 1.69 gev was investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this reaction",
    ", the mass of the resonance was found to be consistent with 1405 mev .",
    "the highest - statistics spectrum in bubble chamber experiments is given in ref .",
    "@xcite through the @xmath20 reaction at 4.2 gev in which the @xmath21 final state forms the @xmath22 resonance with the sequential decays of @xmath23 and @xmath24 . to enhance the @xmath25 production , events with low momentum transfer @xmath26 gev were selected , with the additional constraint on the invariant mass of the @xmath27 system to be @xmath28 gev .",
    "two different modes were analyzed : ( 1 ) @xmath29 and ( 2 ) @xmath30 where the @xmath1 pairs in parenthesis were combined to form @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath31 spectrum in the process ( 1 ) shows a clear peak structure of @xmath0 together with a small amount of @xmath7 . the @xmath16 spectrum in the mode ( 2 ) was also shown in that paper  @xcite .",
    "this spectrum is , however , largely contaminated by the nonresonant background contribution , presumably because of the final state interaction between the @xmath32 and the primary @xmath33 in the @xmath25 decay .",
    "thus , the cleaner @xmath31 spectrum is frequently shown as a representative of the @xmath0 spectrum and used for the input of theoretical models .",
    "in fact , dalitz and deloff analyzed this @xmath31 spectrum to extract the mass and width of @xmath0 using several fitting schemes  @xcite .",
    "this work is the only source of the  central values \" of the mass @xmath34 and the width @xmath35 shown in the current pdg  : @xmath36 it should be nevertheless emphasized that a single charged state of the @xmath1 channel may _ not _ be dominated by the @xmath3 resonant component in view of the strong isospin interference as reported in recent photoproduction experiments discussed below . in addition , since the energy of the @xmath27 system is restricted in the range @xmath28 gev , the higher tail of the @xmath31 spectrum is influenced by the phase space suppression .",
    "this effect should be taken into account when the spectral function of the theoretical model is compared with the experimental mass distribution in ref .",
    "@xcite .      on top of these classical results ,",
    "many new @xmath1 spectra in recent experiments are becoming available .",
    "the first photoproduction experiment was performed by leps collaboration at spring-8 using @xmath37 reaction with the photon energy 1.5 to 2.4 gev  @xcite . by excluding the @xmath38 production in the @xmath39 pair ,",
    "the charged @xmath1 invariant mass spectrum was reconstructed , showing a clear peak structure of @xmath0 .",
    "a remarkable fact is that the  lineshape \" of the @xmath0 resonance is different in @xmath31 and @xmath16 channels , as predicted by the chiral unitary model in ref .",
    "@xcite . neglecting the small @xmath40 component",
    ", the @xmath1 spectra can be decomposed as @xmath41 where @xmath42 represents the @xmath1 amplitude with isospin @xmath43 and @xmath44 stands for the invariant mass of the @xmath1 pair .",
    "it is obvious that the isospin interference term @xmath45 makes the difference of the charged @xmath18 spectra .",
    "lineshapes in @xmath16 and @xmath31 spectra primarily comes from the isospin interference effect . in a specific experiment",
    ", one should also take into account the final state interaction with the unpaired particles as in ref .",
    "it is _ not _ directly related to the two - pole structure discussed in section  [ subsec : doublepole ] . ]",
    "if the resonant @xmath3 amplitude were much larger than the other isospin components , all the @xmath1 spectra would be identical in the resonance energy region .",
    "this is not the case .",
    "leps collaboration further studied the same reaction in ref .",
    "@xcite where the total cross section of the @xmath0 photoproduction was measured for the first time .",
    "the production ratios of @xmath0 to @xmath46 were obtained at two regions of the photon energies . at lower energy ( @xmath47 gev ) , @xmath0 is produced about one half of @xmath46 , while at higher energy ( @xmath48 gev ) , the @xmath0 production is much suppressed .",
    "the absolute value of the differential cross section @xmath49 was obtained as 0.43 @xmath50b ( 0.072 @xmath50b ) for the photon energy @xmath47 gev ( @xmath48 gev ) .",
    "the difference in the charged @xmath1 spectra was again observed , while the shape of the peak was not consistent with the previous measurement  @xcite , presumably because of the different kinematical region of the final state pion .",
    "detailed theoretical analysis for the angular dependence of the @xmath37 reaction will make the situation clear .",
    "the neutral @xmath51 spectrum is observed by crystal ball collaboration in the @xmath52 reaction at @xmath53 - 750 mev  @xcite . as seen in eq .",
    ", the @xmath51 spectrum is free from the @xmath46 resonance with @xmath54 and the isospin interference term , so it is an ideal channel to study the @xmath0 spectrum .",
    "although it was not explicitly mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite , the peak of the spectrum in the @xmath52 reaction locates at 1420 mev  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath55 collision experiment was studied at cosy - jlich in the reaction @xmath56 with 3.65 gev proton beam  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath51 spectrum was constructed from the missing mass of @xmath57 by selecting the events with a @xmath58 in the final state and the constraint on the missing mass @xmath59 mev ( charged @xmath60 baryons do not decay into the final states with @xmath58 ) .",
    "the peak position of @xmath0 was found at 1405 mev .",
    "the total cross section of the @xmath61 reaction was obtained as 4.5 @xmath50b .",
    "there are also preliminary reports on some ongoing experiments .",
    "the result of the photoproduction @xmath62 by clas collaboration at jefferson laboratory was reported in ref .",
    "@xcite where all three @xmath1 charge states were measured in a single experiment for the first time . the differential cross section @xmath63 was also studied .",
    "it is remarkable that the interference pattern of the @xmath1 spectra by clas is different from that in the first data by leps  @xcite ; the peak of the @xmath64 channel is higher ( lower ) than the peak of the @xmath65 spectrum in leps ( clas ) data .",
    "since the theoretical prediction  @xcite reproduces the leps data  @xcite , it contradicts with the clas new data .",
    "we should however note that the angular dependence of the detector acceptance is different from leps to clas , and the theoretical prediction integrates the angles of the final states .",
    "the @xmath66-wave meson - baryon amplitude then contributes differently , which may cause the difference of the spectra . to consistently understand all the photoproduction results  @xcite",
    ", more refined reaction model should be constructed .",
    "the measurement of the @xmath1 spectrum in the @xmath55 collision at 3.5 gev was studied by hades collaboration at gsi  @xcite .",
    "the finalized results from these experiments , together with the planned experiments by e31 at j - parc  @xcite and ikon / kloe at da@xmath67ne  @xcite will further shed light on the structure of @xmath0 .",
    "since @xmath0 is located just below the @xmath2 threshold , the low energy @xmath12 scattering data is closely related to the properties of @xmath0 .",
    "the total cross sections of the @xmath12 scattering into various meson - baryon channels measured in bubble chamber experiments were shown , for instance , in refs .",
    "these data can be used to constrain the global behavior of the meson - baryon amplitude above the @xmath12 threshold , while some of the data points contradict with each other and the cross sections into the neutral final states ( @xmath51 , @xmath68 ) are relatively poor .",
    "the planned new experiment of the low energy @xmath12 scattering at da@xmath67ne  @xcite will improve the precision of the total cross section data .",
    "an important quantitative constraint can be given by the threshold branching ratios .",
    "they were accurately determined from the @xmath69 capture by hydrogen as  @xcite @xmath70 at the @xmath12 threshold .",
    "the ratio @xmath71 indicates that the double - charge exchange process @xmath72 is larger than the ordinary process @xmath73 .",
    "the @xmath2 scattering lengths @xmath74 are also important threshold quantities .",
    "the extrapolation of the low energy @xmath2 scattering , with the dispersion relations and @xmath34-matrix method , leads to the scattering lengths @xmath75 fm and @xmath76 fm  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath12 scattering length , which is the combination @xmath77 in the isospin limit , can be extracted from the measurement of the mass shift by strong interaction @xmath78 and the width @xmath35 of the @xmath79 level of the kaonic hydrogen . in general , the scattering length due to the strong interaction is related to the energy level of the mesic atom _ via _ deser - trueman formula  @xcite .",
    "systematic improvement of the formula has been achieved by the effective non - relativistic field theory for the kaonic hydrogen  @xcite and for the kaonic deuterium  @xcite . there",
    ", the isospin breaking correction turns out to be important .    the old experiments of the kaonic hydrogen found attractive energy shifts , which were in contradiction with the analysis of the low energy @xmath2 scattering  @xcite .",
    "the situation became clear by the precise measurement of the kaonic x ray at kek , which leads to the repulsive shift @xmath80 ev and the width @xmath81 ev  @xcite .",
    "this result agrees with the negative scattering length and the long - standing puzzle has been solved .",
    "however , the quantitative determination is not settled yet , because new data from the dear collaboration at da@xmath67ne  @xcite deviates from the kek result . in dear experiment , the shift and width were obtained as @xmath82 ev and @xmath83 ev . to resolve the discrepancy and further reduce the uncertainties ,",
    "siddharta collaboration has performed the newest measurement of the kaonic hydrogen x rays at da@xmath67ne  @xcite .",
    "they found @xmath84 ev and @xmath85 ev . the results have the smallest error bars and are closer to the kek measurement , rather than dear .",
    "the precise determination of the @xmath12 scattering length through the measurement of the kaonic hydrogen is an important input for the models of the @xmath4 meson - baryon scattering .",
    "there are plenty of theoretical studies on @xmath0 , for which we can not complete the list of references . here",
    "we pick up typical works in quark - model picture and meson - baryon picture , and summarize the status of lattice qcd simulation .    as mentioned in the introduction",
    ", the simple quark model picture  @xcite has some difficulties to reproduce @xmath0 . to describe negative parity baryons by three quarks , one of the quarks has to be excited to the @xmath86 orbit",
    "this excitation energy is usually normalized in the nucleon sector , where one of the lowest negative parity baryons is @xmath6 .",
    "thus , the excitation is roughly 600 mev , which indicates the negative parity @xmath87 around 1700 mev .",
    "in fact , in a simple three - quark picture , @xmath0 would be heavier than the @xmath6 since it contains one strange quark .",
    "moreover , for an @xmath86 state , the spin - orbit partner should appear in the @xmath8 channel . in the nucleon sector , the lowest @xmath8 state is the @xmath88 resonance which almost degenerates with @xmath6 , while @xmath0 and @xmath7 are split more than 100 mev .",
    "however , it is fair to mention that the mass of @xmath0 can be reconciled in the three - quark picture , with the help of certain specific mass splitting operators such as those in the @xmath89 permutation symmetry  @xcite and those in the @xmath90 expansions  @xcite expansion for the negative parity baryons , however , it is found that the mass of the @xmath0 can not be reproduced  @xcite when the exact wavefunction is adopted instead of the truncated wavefunction used in ref .",
    "@xcite . ] .",
    "in addition , five - quark picture can reproduce the low mass of @xmath0  @xcite because the negative parity state can be expressed by putting four quarks and one antiquark in the @xmath91 orbit . the five - quark picture",
    ", however , predicts more excited baryons in addition to those observed in experiments .    the meson - baryon picture has been studied in the vector - meson exchange models  @xcite .",
    "more quantitative discussion was made in the meson - exchange potential models as in refs .",
    "@xcite . in these studies",
    ", @xmath0 can be dynamically generated from the meson - baryon interactions , without introducing the bare field .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that @xmath0 can be described by the kaon bound state approach in the skyrme model  @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "strange baryons are described as bound states of a kaon in the background field of the two - flavor skyrmion . from the quantitative point of view , the binding energy is generally overestimated with typical parameters of the skyrme model , while the splitting with @xmath7 is rather reasonable .",
    "electromagnetic structures of @xmath0 in this approach were studied in ref .",
    "more quantitative studies have been performed using the three - flavor cloudy bag model  @xcite which is an extension of the quark bag model to incorporate the meson cloud .",
    "the model contains both the bare @xmath0 state and the meson - baryon state whose interactions are constrained by chiral symmetry , and the dominance of the meson - baryon component was pointed out .",
    "one of the interesting consequences of the cloudy bag model lies in the pole structure in the complex energy plane . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the meson - baryon scattering amplitude was analyzed in the complex energy plane using several potential models and the cloudy bag model of ref .",
    "@xcite . by fitting the scattering data ,",
    "the potential models generate one pole for @xmath0 , while in the cloudy bag model , _ two poles _ were found in the energy region of @xmath0 .. ] this is the first mentioning of the double - pole structure of @xmath0 in literature , which will be discussed in detail in section  [ subsec : doublepole ] .",
    "lattice qcd is the most promising approach to the nonperturbative regime of strong interaction . in lattice qcd",
    ", the mass of a hadron is usually extracted from the two - point correlation function using some operator which creates and annihilates the hadron state of interest .",
    "the lattice investigation of @xmath0 , together with negative parity excited baryons , was started by quenched simulations with three - quark operators  @xcite .",
    "it was found that the simple three - quark picture did not reproduce the mass of @xmath0 and some multiquark and/or meson - baryon components would be necessary . in response to these results ,",
    "the simulation with five - quark operators  @xcite was performed , while the lowest energy state was found in heavier region than @xmath0 .",
    "the full qcd simulation with three - quark operator was done in ref .",
    "@xcite , including the mixing of the flavor singlet and octet states . in this case , again , the low mass of 1405 mev was not reproduced .",
    "thus , at present , the description of @xmath0 is a difficult but challenging issue in lattice qcd .",
    "one should also note that @xmath0 is a resonance at physical point , although it is a bound state below the threshold in the heavy pion mass region .",
    "the recent development of lattice qcd enables one to describe excited hadrons as resonances in the hadron - hadron scattering  @xcite",
    ". such an approach may be more appropriate to describe the @xmath0 resonance in the @xmath2-@xmath1 scattering system , rather than the extraction from the two - point correlation functions .",
    "the chiral unitary approach is a powerful theoretical tool to describe the hadron scattering amplitude including resonances .",
    "this approach is based on two guiding principles ; chiral symmetry for low energy hadron dynamics , and general properties of the scattering amplitude such as unitarity and analyticity .",
    "the @xmath0 resonance in the @xmath4 meson - baryon scattering is well described in this approach . in this section ,",
    "we formulate the chiral unitary approach for meson - baryon scattering .    after a brief overview of the framework",
    ", we construct effective lagrangian of chiral perturbation theory for the meson - baryon system , starting from the chiral symmetry of qcd in section  [ subsec : chpt ] .",
    "the low energy meson - baryon interaction is derived in section  [ subsec : interaction ] up to @xmath92 order in chiral perturbation theory .",
    "the nonperturbative unitarized amplitude is derived in two different ways .",
    "one is to use the scattering equation with the on - shell factorization method ( section  [ subsec : lseq ] ) , and the other is based on the n / d method in scattering theory ( section  [ subsec : n / d ] ) .",
    "we show that both the methods lead to the same scattering amplitude . in section  [ subsec : origin ] ,",
    "we discuss how the resonances are described in the scattering amplitude .",
    "the origin of resonances is investigated from the viewpoint of renormalization schemes .",
    "the low energy qcd exhibits rich spectra and complicated dynamics of hadrons due to color confinement and chiral symmetry breaking . the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking causes the appearance of the nambu - goldstone ( ng ) bosons as the light pseudoscalar mesons and the dynamical mass generation of hadrons  @xcite .",
    "in addition to these static properties , the dynamics of the ng bosons is constrained by chiral symmetry through the low energy theorems .",
    "for instance , the scattering length of the ng boson with a target hadron is determined up to its sign and strength through the weinberg - tomozawa theorem  @xcite , which works quite well for the @xmath93 and @xmath94 channels .",
    "the dynamics of hadrons and ng bosons are concisely summarized in chiral perturbation theory with the systematic power counting scheme  @xcite , in which the low energy theorems are correctly encoded as the leading order result of the perturbative expansion .",
    "thus , chiral perturbation theory describes the low energy limit of the meson - baryon scattering amplitude .    on the other hand , physical scattering amplitude should satisfy the unitarity condition of the s - matrix which follows from the probability conservation during the time evolution of the system .",
    "although a solution of the nonperturbative scattering equation satisfies the unitarity condition , perturbative calculation of the amplitude can spoil the unitarity .",
    "for instance , since the amplitude in chiral perturbation theory is expanded in powers of the energy of the ng boson , as we go to higher energy , the amplitude monotonically increases and eventually violates the unitarity bound at certain kinematical scale .",
    "this does not cause a serious problem for the description of the low energy behavior of the amplitude , but resonances can not be treated in perturbative calculation unless they are introduced as explicit degrees of freedom .",
    "thus , the naive extrapolation of the amplitude to the higher energy region is not justified .",
    "the importance of the unitarity and nonperturbative dynamics has been pointed out for the @xmath2-@xmath1 system  @xcite where the inter - hadron interaction is considered to be strong . in order to extend the low energy chiral interaction to the resonance energy region ,",
    "it is mandatory to combine the interaction with some kinds of unitarization technique .    in this way ,",
    "chiral symmetry for the low energy ng boson dynamics and the unitarity of the scattering amplitude are important guiding principles to construct hadron scattering amplitude .",
    "attempts to combine the unitarity condition with chiral perturbation theory have been started using the inverse amplitude method in meson scattering sector  @xcite , and using the lippmann - schwinger equation in baryon sector  @xcite .",
    "the recent development of the analysis of baryon resonances owes much to the framework based on the n / d method  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the chiral unitary approach reproduces hadron scattering amplitude successfully .",
    "thanks to the universality of the chiral interaction for the ng boson dynamics , the approach has been applied to various hadron scatterings with the ng bosons as shown in section  [ subsec : application ] . in this section",
    "we illustrate the theoretical framework of the chiral unitary approach for @xmath95-wave meson - baryon scattering amplitude in detail .",
    "see also the review article of the chiral unitary approach  @xcite .",
    "the strong interaction is governed by quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) which is a color su(3 ) gauge theory of quarks as fundamental fields and gluons as gauge fields . the three - flavor ( @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath95 ) massless qcd lagrangian is given by @xmath98      + \\bar{q}i\\gamma^{\\mu}d_{\\mu}q      \\label{eq : qcd0 } , \\\\      & \\quad       g_{\\mu\\nu}=\\partial_{\\mu}a_{\\mu}-\\partial_{\\nu}a_{\\mu }      -ig[a_{\\mu},a_{\\nu } ] ,      \\quad       d_{\\mu}=\\partial_{\\mu}-iga_{\\mu } ,      \\quad      a_{\\mu}=\\sum_{a}t^{a}a_{\\mu}^{a }      \\nonumber , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath99 is the quark field , @xmath100 are the gluon fields , @xmath101 are the generators of the color su(3 ) group with gell - mann matrices @xmath102 , and @xmath103 is the gauge coupling constant .",

    "it is useful to define the left- and right - handed quarks as @xmath104 with projection operators @xmath105 . in terms of the left- and right - handed quarks , the lagrangian",
    "can be expressed as @xmath106      + \\bar{q}_{l}i\\gamma^{\\mu}d_{\\mu}q_{l }      + \\bar{q}_{r}i\\gamma^{\\mu}d_{\\mu}q_{r } .",

    "by virtue of the power counting rule , chiral perturbation theory is renormalizable and crossing symmetric at given order .",
    "the unitarity of the amplitude is however satisfied only perturbatively , and resonances can not be treated dynamically . in the chiral unitary approach ,",
    "on the other hand , the infinite resummation of diagrams recovers the unitarity of the amplitude . at the same time , the resummation spoils the systematic power counting , so the amplitude @xmath272 in general depends on the cutoff parameter , the subtraction constant .",
    ", as was done in the meson sector  @xcite . in the baryon sector , this requires the computation of the interaction kernel up to @xmath166 . ]",
    "since the contributions from the unphysical cuts are neglected , the crossing symmetry is lost in the above formulation .",
    "thus , it is important to choose the appropriate scheme for the analysis of the system in question .",
    "for instance , the leading order chiral interaction for @xmath94 channel   is not strong enough to generate bound states and resonances , which is in accordance with the absence of @xmath95-wave resonances around the @xmath94 threshold .",
    "therefore , the @xmath95-wave @xmath94 system around the threshold can be well described in chiral perturbation theory . on the other hand , in the @xmath2-@xmath1 system",
    ", chiral interaction is found to be strong and it is experimentally known that the @xmath0 resonance exist below the @xmath2 threshold . in the latter case ,",
    "the unitarization is mandatory to deal with the strong dynamics of the hadronic interaction .",
    "we have discussed the construction of the meson - baryon scattering amplitude .",

    ", we show the basic properties of the resonance pole and study the origin of resonances through the renormalization procedure .",
    "the resonance state is expressed in the scattering amplitude as a pole singularity in the second riemann sheet of the complex energy plane and the two momenta are mapped onto the same energy . in the first riemann sheet , only bound state poles can appear as singularities , while resonance poles lie in the second riemann sheet . ] .",
    "the real and imaginary parts of the pole position correspond to the mass @xmath319 and the half width @xmath320 of the resonance state , respectively , and the residue of the pole is the product of the coupling strength @xmath321 of the resonance to the channel @xmath190 . on the real axis , the scattering amplitude can be written as the sum of the breit - wigner pole term and the nonresonant background contribution @xmath322 which is assumed to be a slowly varying function of @xmath193 : @xmath323    since the amplitude of the chiral unitary approach is given in analytic form , it is easy to perform the analytic continuation to the complex energy plane . in the chiral unitary approach ,",
    "the riemann sheet of the amplitude is fully specified by the loop function which contains the information of the relative momentum of the two - body system . in practice",
    ", the amplitude in the second riemann sheet can be obtained by using the following loop function : @xmath324 from the expression of the amplitude  , it is possible to extract the coupling strengths @xmath321 to the meson - baryon channel @xmath190 by calculating the residues of the pole : @xmath325 with @xmath326 . in this way",
    ", the properties of the resonance can be extracted from the pole of the amplitude .",
    "in general , the origin of resonances in the two - body scattering amplitude can be classified into two categories .",
    "one is the preexisting elementary state in the free hamiltonian .",
    "if there are open channels at the energy of this state , it acquires a finite width through the couplings to the channels .",
    "the other is the state which is dynamically generated by two - body attraction and does not exist in the free hamiltonian . in the terminology of scattering theory ,",
    "the former state is introduced additionally to the scattering equation as a pole term called the cdd pole  @xcite .",
    "taking only the hadronic degrees of freedom into account , we regard the former ( latter ) state as the elementary ( composite ) particle .    the investigation of the compositeness / elementarity of a particle is a long - standing problem  @xcite .",
    "for instance , the property of the deuteron is studied using the relation between the compositeness and the binding energy  @xcite . in the chiral unitary approach",
    ", the nonperturbative resummation can generate composite states dynamically , while the contribution from elementary particles can be included in the interaction kernel @xmath273 .",
    "therefore , it has been considered that the origin of the resonance is identified from the structure of the interaction kernel .",
    "for instance , the resonances generated by the wt interaction were considered as the hadronic molecular resonances , since the interaction kernel has no pole term contribution .",
    "however , it is found that the cdd pole contribution can also be hidden in the cutoff parameter in the loop function  @xcite .",
    "let us discuss the origin of resonances in the amplitude in the chiral unitary approach . for simplicity ,",
    "we consider the single - channel case .",
    "the extension to the multi - channel problem is discussed in ref .",
    "as explained in section  [ subsec : lseq ] , the subtraction constant has to be introduced to determine the finite part of the loop function . in the conventional approach , the subtraction constant is regarded as a cutoff parameter and is used to fit experimental data .",
    "although the choice of the cutoff is not constrained _ a priori _ , certain value of the subtraction constant can bring in a seed of the resonance . to demonstrate this ,",
    "let us examine the loop function @xmath309 in detail .",
    "discretizing the energy of the intermediate state as @xmath327 , the loop function in eq .",
    "can be schematically represented by @xmath328 where @xmath329 is a real non - negative function representing the spectral density of the state @xmath153 .",
    "if the model space consists exclusively of the meson - baryon scattering states , the energy of the lowest - lying state @xmath330 is given by the threshold , and @xmath331 for all @xmath153 .",
    "noting that the spectral function is positive definite , the loop function @xmath309 should be negative for the energy below the threshold , @xmath332 .",
    "however , if we choose the subtraction constant @xmath333 freely , the loop function below the threshold can become positive .",
    "the meaning of the violation of negativity of the loop function is understood in the following way . in the first place , the interaction @xmath273 and the loop function @xmath130",
    "are entangled and can not be determined separately .",
    "this is schematically written by introducing @xmath333 dependence in @xmath273 as @xmath334 there are infinitely many combinations of @xmath335 and @xmath336 which reproduce the same amplitude @xmath337 .",
    "the formulation in the previous sections was based on the phenomenological renormalization scheme , in which the interaction @xmath273 is determined by chiral perturbation theory first and the subtraction constant in the loop function @xmath130 is fixed by experimental data . with the weinberg - tomozawa interaction , the scattering amplitude",
    "is given by @xmath338 where @xmath339 denotes the subtraction constant chosen to reproduce experimental data .",
    "in this scheme , the subtraction constant represents the effects which are not included in the interaction kernel .",
    "although the low energy constants in the higher order terms contain the information of the contracted resonance propagator  @xcite , it is clear from eq .   that there is no s - channel resonance contribution in the wt interaction",
    "this means that , in the framework of eq .  , the loop function @xmath130 should be responsible for the contribution from independent particles , if they exist",
    "this effect is considered as the cdd pole contribution hidden in the loop function . in this case ,",
    "the origin of the resonance in the amplitude @xmath272 is not exclusively related to the structure of the interaction kernel @xmath273 .    to discuss the origin of the resonance in a transparent manner , it is desirable to construct the renormalization condition such that the loop function is free from the cdd pole contribution and all the nontrivial structures are embedded in the interaction kernel . to this end ,",
    "the _ natural renormalization scheme _ has been proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . as discussed above , when the model space of the theory contains only the two - body meson - baryon scattering states , the loop function necessarily has negative values below the threshold : @xmath340 for @xmath341 .",
    "in addition , since the interaction kernel @xmath273 is derived in chiral perturbation theory , we require that the amplitude @xmath337 should reduce to the tree level @xmath342 at some matching scale @xmath343 .",
    "this is achieved by @xmath344 where the scale @xmath345 should be chosen in the low energy region @xmath346 .",
    "noting that the loop function is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath193 in the region of @xmath347 , to satisfy both the requirements , we obtain @xmath348 and the renormalization condition is determined uniquely as @xmath349 the subtraction constant @xmath350 obtained in this equation is called the natural subtraction constant . in this scheme , since the loop function is determined by the theoretical argument , the interaction kernel @xmath273 should be adjusted to reproduce experimental data .",
    "thus , the scattering amplitude is expressed by the loop function with the natural subtraction constant and the effective interaction in this scheme @xmath351 as @xmath352 by the definition of the natural subtraction constant , the loop function does not contain any seed of resonance , so the nontrivial origin of resonances should be attributed to the interaction kernel @xmath273 . if eq",

    "and are the different expressions of the same physical amplitude @xmath337 .",
    "so , by equating two amplitudes , we obtain @xmath353 the left hand side is completely determined by chiral perturbation theory and data fitting , while the natural subtraction constant in the right hand side is fixed by eq .   theoretically .",
    "thus , solving this equation for @xmath351 , we obtain the effective interaction in the natural scheme .",
    "this can be expressed as the sum of the original wt interaction and a pole term : @xmath354 where we have used the explicit forms of @xmath355 in eq .   and @xmath336 in eq .   for the single - channel scattering and ignored the small energy dependence of the kinematical factor in the interaction @xmath356 .",
    "the mass of the pole term is given by the difference of the subtraction constants @xmath357 as @xmath358 it is important to note that the numerator of the pole term in eq .",
    "is quadratic in the meson energy @xmath359 , so this term is in higher order than the wt interaction .",
    "namely , the low energy theorem is maintained in the effective interaction  .",
    "equation   shows that any slight difference of the phenomenologically determined subtraction constant from the natural value introduces a pole term in the interaction kernel in the natural renormalization scheme . for a molecular type resonance , the phenomenological subtraction",
    "constant is close to the natural value and @xmath360 becomes small .",
    "therefore , the effective mass   takes a large value and the pole term goes away from the relevant energy region of resonances . on the other hand , as the deviation of the phenomenological constant from the natural value increases ,",
    "the pole mass approaches the baryon mass @xmath34 and the pole term will substantially affect the amplitude around the resonance . in this case , the origin of the resonance can be attributed to this pole term , rather than the dynamical meson - baryon molecule .",
    "it is important that the contribution from the independent particle can be hidden in the loop function through the renormalization procedure .",
    "the natural renormalization scheme is used to analyze the origin of the physical baryon resonances in section  [ subsec : lambda1405mbstate ] .",

    "it was turned out that , according to the su(3 ) flavor relation of the meson - baryon couplings , the @xmath412 ( @xmath121 ) exchange is dominated in the @xmath479 ( @xmath480 ) transition , and thus the ratio of the transition rates of @xmath481 to @xmath395 and @xmath482 is strongly sensitive to the @xmath474 coupling strengths to @xmath361 and @xmath1 . the partial decay width of @xmath0 in the non - mesonic decay was found to be around 20 mev at the nuclear saturation density .",
    "the understanding of @xmath0 is an interesting and challenging subject in hadron physics after fifty years since its discovery . in this article , we have summarized the status of experimental and theoretical investigations on the @xmath0 resonance . among others ,",
    "we present a detailed introduction of chiral unitary approach as a successful and promising theoretical framework to describe @xmath0 .",
    "the meson - baryon scattering amplitude is formulated with the basic principles of hadron scattering : chiral symmetry of qcd for the low energy interaction and unitarity of the s - matrix .",
    "excited baryons are described as pole singularities in the scattering amplitude , whose physical origins are discussed at length .",
    "the observables in @xmath4 meson - baryon scattering as well as the properties of the @xmath0 resonance are well described in the chiral unitary approach .",
    "the structure of @xmath0 has been studied from various aspects in the chiral unitary approach .",
    "it is shown that the @xmath0 resonance is associated with two poles in the complex energy plane as a consequence of the two attractive components of the chiral low energy interaction .",
    "we summarize how the mass spectra of the @xmath1 channel in various reactions are reflected by the pole structure together with possible contamination which modifies the experimental spectra .",
    "we then focus on the internal structure of @xmath0 . through the analysis of the renormalization procedure ,",
    "we show that the possible seed of the resonance is hidden in the loop function which can be extracted by the use of the natural renormalization scheme . in the case of @xmath0 , such nontrivial contribution",
    "is found to be small at the energy region of the resonance , implying the dominance of the meson - baryon structure in @xmath0 .",
    "the analysis of the @xmath483 scaling shows that the three - quark component of @xmath0 is small .",
    "the electromagnetic size of @xmath0 turns out to be larger than the typical three - quark hadrons .",
    "all these findings consistently indicate the meson - baryon molecular structure of @xmath0 .",
    "we have also briefly reviewed the application of the chiral unitary approach to various hadron resonances in different flavor - spin sectors .",
    "finally we have also discussed the properties of @xmath0 in various environments , especially in few - body systems .",
    "thanks to the @xmath2 quasi - bound component of @xmath0 , we expect further various hadronic molecular systems with kaons and nucleons systematically .",
    "this novel structure is driven by the two - sided nature of the antikaon ; the @xmath412 meson has the nature of the nambu - goldstone particle associated with the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry , which deduces @xmath95-wave attractions in @xmath361 and @xmath418 , but at the same time @xmath412 is moderately heavy due to the strange quark mass . in the nuclear matter ,",
    "@xmath0 exhibits complicated dynamics due to the strong coupling to @xmath2 and @xmath1 channels . in summary ,",
    "the large meson - baryon component in @xmath0 is responsible for the peculiar features of @xmath0 in many - body systems .    at present",
    ", there are several directions of studies of @xmath0 to be pursued . in closing this paper ,",
    "we summarize future perspectives below .    *",
    "_ exploration of the structure _ : it has been shown that @xmath0 is dominated by meson - baryon molecular structure , based on several theoretical arguments .",
    "although this is a reasonable and plausible scenario , it is important to examine this picture in experiments , by relating the internal structure with experimental observables .",
    "an attempt in this direction has been recently presented in ref .",
    "@xcite ; it is shown that the production yield of a particle in heavy ion collisions can be used to investigate its internal structure .",
    "it is also desirable to establish a model - independent and quantitative argument to assess the structure of resonances . for this purpose ,",
    "compositeness of bound states defined in refs .",
    "@xcite may be used as a baseline of the discussion  @xcite . *",
    "_ theoretical foundation of resonances _ : we have discussed that some quantities concerning @xmath0 , such as coupling constants and the form factors , are obtained as complex numbers in the dynamical framework .",
    "this is because @xmath0 is not a stable particle but an unstable resonance state .",
    "in order to give an interpretation to these results , resonance states should be formulated on a firm theoretical ground . *",
    "_ realistic @xmath2-@xmath1 interaction _ : quantitatively refined theoretical models for the @xmath2-@xmath1 amplitudes are essential both for the study of the structure of @xmath0 and for the applications to the @xmath9 few - body systems .",
    "one of the key quantities is the binding energy of the quasi - bound @xmath2 system ( position of the higher energy pole ) , which is closely related to the @xmath2 scattering length and the @xmath1 mass spectrum .",
    "the present analysis can be systematically improved by including new experimental data and higher order terms of the chiral lagrangian .",
    "determination of the @xmath1 threshold behavior is also essential to constrain the @xmath2-@xmath1 amplitude  @xcite .",
    "this allows one to extrapolate the amplitude down to the lower energy region . * _ experiments and lattice qcd _ : to pin down the property and structure of the @xmath0 resonance , experimental studies are indispensable . as mentioned above , an urgent issue is to accumulate precise data of the @xmath2 scattering length and the @xmath1 spectrum .",
    "the interpretation of experimental results should be guided by theoretical investigations of the reaction mechanism such as ref .",
    "@xcite . in the longer term",
    ", the improvement of the cross sections of low energy @xmath362 scattering and the threshold information of the @xmath1 channel will help the calibration of the theoretical models .",
    "experimental searches for the @xmath9 few - body systems will also complement the constraints . currently , direct application of the lattice qcd technique to the @xmath0 resonance is no simple task .",
    "it is however becoming possible to extract the meson - baryon interaction in lattice qcd  @xcite .",
    "this will assist the determination of the observables for which experimental studies are difficult .",
    "the experimental activities and lattice qcd simulations , together with theoretical studies of the @xmath0 resonance will open new paradigm for the hadron and nuclear physics .",

    "<S> the @xmath0 baryon resonance plays an outstanding role in various aspects in hadron and nuclear physics . </S>",
    "<S> it has been considered that the @xmath0 resonance is generated by the attractive interaction of the antikaon and the nucleon as a quasi - bound state below its threshold decaying into the @xmath1 channel . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the structure of @xmath0 is closely related to the @xmath2 interaction which is the fundamental ingredient to study few - body systems with antikaon . in this paper , after reviewing the basic properties of the @xmath0 resonance , we introduce the dynamical coupled - channel model which respects chiral symmetry of qcd and the unitarity of the scattering amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the structure of the @xmath0 resonance is dominated by the meson - baryon molecular component and is described as a superposition of two independent states . </S>",
    "<S> the meson - baryon nature of @xmath0 leads to various hadronic molecular states in few - body systems with strangeness which are hadron composite systems driven by the hadronic interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we summarize the recent progress in the investigation of the @xmath0 structure and future perspective of the physics of the @xmath0 resonance . </S>"
