    "<S> we investigate through non - equilibrium molecular dynamic simulations the flow of core - softened fluids inside nanotubes . </S>",
    "<S> our results reveal a anomalous increase of the overall mass flux for nanotubes with sufficiently smaller radii . </S>",
    "<S> this is explained in terms of a transition from a single - file type of flow to the movement of an ordered - like fluid as the nanotube radius increases . </S>",
    "<S> the occurrence of a global minimum in the mass flux at this transition reflects the competition between the two characteristics length scales of the core - softened potential . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , by increasing further the radius , another substantial change in the flow behavior , which becomes more evident at low temperatures , leads to a local minimum in the overall mass flux . </S>",
    "<S> microscopically , this second transition results from the formation of a double - layer of flowing particles in the confined nanotube space . </S>",
    "<S> these special nano - fluidic features of core - softened particles closely resemble the enhanced flow behavior observed for liquid water inside carbon nanotubes .    </S>",
    "<S> the recent development of nanofabrication techniques have opened the possibility of building nanoscale structures  @xcite that can effectively mimic biological channels  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this new technology has generated devices with application not only as controlled models for biological systems , but also as laboratory gatekeepers that are chemically selective and could therefore eventually function as nanofilters  @xcite .    at the nanoscale , however , fluid properties differ significantly from what usual hydrodynamics would predict . for instance , this is the case of recent experiments highlighting the exceptional properties of carbon nanotubes  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> precisely , these studies revealed that certain microelectromechanical fabrication processes are capable to assemble a macroscopic collection of carbon nanotubes with diameters in a range as small as @xmath0-@xmath1 nm . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it has been shown that the water flux in these special membranes can be three to four orders of magnitude larger than the value prediction from the continuum - based no - slip hagen - poiseuille ( hp ) relation  @xcite , as also confirmed by computer simulations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this water flow increase is not uniform with the different nanotube radius . </S>",
    "<S> as the nanotube radius is reduced , the flow decreases up to a certain threshold , and for smaller radius it increases again , as reported by computational  @xcite and experimenal  @xcite works . </S>",
    "<S> this non - monotonic behavior is attributed to the transition from continuum to sub - continuum transport as the nanotube shrinks  @xcite and can also be driven by hydrophobicity  @xcite . however , despite the use of all atom models for water , the computational results are only qualitatively comparable to the experiments . the approximations employed in the water models and friction effects might be the origin of these numerical differences  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the different atomistic models for water give , therefore , a qualitative description of the experimental enhancement flow . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the major ingredient for the rapid flux is not related to the details of the model , but to the effective interactions that they do represent .    in the last two decades a number of effective model potentials have been suggested for water  @xcite . despite their simplicity , </S>",
    "<S> these models exhibit in bulk the thermodynamic , dynamic and structural anomalies of water and also predict the existence of a second critical point hypothesized by poole and collaborators for the st2 water model  @xcite . in this way </S>",
    "<S> , we test if this effective models for water - like fluids can qualitatively reproduce the anomalous enhanced flux in nanotubes with small radius , observed in experiments for water  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . the presence of this anomalous behavior will show that the enhanced flow will occur to liquids without any directionality , and can not depend on the formation and destruction of hydrogen bonds .    </S>",
    "<S> the fluid is modeled as point - like particles with effective diameter @xmath2 and mass @xmath3 , interacting through the three dimensional core - softened potential  @xcite    @xmath4 +   u_0 { \\rm{exp}}\\left[-\\frac{1}{c^2}\\left(\\frac{r - r_0}{\\sigma}\\right)^2\\right]\\;. \\label{alaneq}\\ ] ]    where @xmath5 is the distance between particles @xmath6 and @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the first term on the right is the standard 12 - 6 lennard - jones ( lj ) potential  @xcite and the second corresponds to a gaussian centered at @xmath8 , with depth @xmath9 and width @xmath10 . for @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , the potential ( [ alaneq ] ) displays two different length scales , namely , one at @xmath14 , where the force has a local minimum , and another at @xmath15 , where the fraction of imaginary modes shows a local maximum  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has been previously observed @xcite that the pressure - temperature phase diagram of this system at equilibrium exhibits features similar to the anomalies present in water  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> here we study the dynamic behavior of this fluid confined in a nanotube connected to two reservoirs , namely , cv@xmath16 on the left of the nanotube and cv@xmath17 at the right . </S>",
    "<S> an illustration of the nanotube - reservoir setup is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the simulation box is a parallelepiped with dimensions @xmath18 in @xmath19- , @xmath20 and @xmath21-directions , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the box size in the @xmath19-direction is defined as @xmath22 for all simulations , and for the @xmath23 and @xmath21-directions is @xmath24 for all nanotubes with radius @xmath25 , and @xmath26 otherwise . </S>",
    "<S> the tube structure is built as a wrapped sheet of lj particles with diameter @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> nanotube and water - like particles interact through the purely repulsive weeks - chandler - andersen ( wca ) potential @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the nanotube entrances are surrounded by flat walls , which also interact with the fluid particles through the wca potential .    , and a low density reservoir , cv@xmath17 , connected by a nanotube . for better visualization , </S>",
    "<S> only half of the nanotube particles are shown . </S>",
    "<S> flat and repulsive walls surround each entrance of the nanotube ( not shown ) . </S>",
    "<S> the cylindrical nanotube in the center has radius @xmath28 and length @xmath29.,width=302 ]    the average temperature of the system is fixed by means of the nose - hoover heat - bath scheme with a coupling parameter @xmath30 , and </S>",
    "<S> periodic boundary conditions are applied in all directions . for simplicity </S>",
    "<S> , we also assume that the nanotube atoms are motionless ( i.e. , not time - integrated ) during the entire simulation . </S>",
    "<S> a constant time step of @xmath31 , in lj time units  @xcite is adopted .    </S>",
    "<S> a steady state flux through the nanotube is induced by fixing a higher density in the reservoir cv@xmath16 , @xmath32 , and a lower density in cv@xmath17 , @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> the initial configuration of the particles in the system is generated using a standard gcmc simulation in each reservoir , during @xmath34 steps , with the initial velocity for each particle obtained from a maxwell - boltzmann distribution at a desired temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the density in the reservoirs is maintained constant using the dual control volume grand canonical molecular dynamics ( dcv - gcmd ) method  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> precisely , the desired densities are restored in cv@xmath16 and cv@xmath17 by intercalating the md steps with a number of gcmc steps inside the corresponding control volumes , as depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] . in our simulations , </S>",
    "<S> an initial @xmath34 md steps were used for equilibration of the system , and 150 gcmc steps were performed for every 500 md steps during the dcv - gcmd process . </S>",
    "<S> final results were typically obtained after performing a total of @xmath35 md steps for each simulation , and averaging over @xmath36 to @xmath37 independent runs to evaluate relevant physical quantities .    </S>",
    "<S> the axial flux of particles through the tube , @xmath38 , is computed by counting the number of particles that cross the channel from left to right , @xmath39 , and the particles flowing from right to left , @xmath40 @xcite , @xmath41 where @xmath42 , @xmath43 is the total number of steps used in the simulation , and @xmath44 is the md time step . in an entirely similar way </S>",
    "<S> , we evaluate the flux in the @xmath19-direction for the non - confined case , @xmath45 .    , in units of the non - confined flux , @xmath46 , for different interaction potentials . </S>",
    "<S> the inset shows the fluid - fluid interaction , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ alaneq ] ) , as function of the separation distance @xmath47 between two particles , and for different values of @xmath48.,width=302 ]    here we assume that the fluid - fluid interaction , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ alaneq ] ) , has a cutoff radius @xmath49 for all cases . </S>",
    "<S> the nanotube radius is varied from @xmath50 to @xmath51 , and , in all simulations , the tube length is fixed to @xmath52 . in order to characterize the effect of the two length scales in the potential ( [ alaneq ] ) , simulations were performed for four values of the parameter @xmath48 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , where this last case corresponds to the standard @xmath57 lj fluid .    figure  [ fig2 ] illustrates the dependence of the mass flux with the nanotube radius for different values of @xmath48 . the inset shows how this parameter affects the shape of the interaction potential . in all models </S>",
    "<S> the temperature was fixed to @xmath58 , where @xmath59 and @xmath60 is the boltzmann constant . for @xmath53 and sufficiently large values of the nanotube radius , </S>",
    "<S> the flux reaches a maximum which is approximately equal to its corresponding bulk value . </S>",
    "<S> as expected , by decreasing the radius , the flux gradually decreases from this saturation value , due to the obvious mass transport limitations of the confined nanotube geometry . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , as the radius is reduced even more , the flux reaches a minimum at @xmath61 and starts to increase sharply , revealing anomalously large values for a range of significantly reduced nanotube radii . </S>",
    "<S> anomalies in the transport behavior have also been previously observed with atomistic  @xcite and effective models  @xcite of water . in these cases , </S>",
    "<S> the diffusion coefficient is evaluated in confined environments , but under equilibrium conditions , which leads to an apparent measure . </S>",
    "<S> this can be substantially different from the effective mass transport @xmath62 quantified here .    as shown in the inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] , the interaction potential for @xmath63 displays a shoulder - like profile with a small barrier between the two length scales . </S>",
    "<S> our simulations for this case also indicate the presence of a minimum followed by anomalously large flux values for radii smaller than the critical radius , as can be seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , despite the decrease in the energy barrier from @xmath53 to @xmath63 , the critical radius is the same for both potentials since they still possess identical characteristics lengths .    </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath64 , the potential exhibits a quasi - lj shape , as shown in the inset of the fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] , with a small attractive well in the first characteristic length and a small barrier between this and the second characteristic length . as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] , the anomalous behavior vanishes in this case . the competition between the two length scales becomes irrelevant as it becomes energetically viable for a particle to transit from positions corresponding to the first and second characteristic lengths . </S>",
    "<S> previous works for this core - softened models show that , even in bulk , this fluids only feature water anomalies when exist competition between the length scales in the interaction potential  @xcite . finally , as expected for simple lj liquids ( i.e. , @xmath65 )  @xcite , we do not observe the anomalous increase in flux for small radius , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] .     at temperature @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> an ordered liquid behavior is observed for a nanotube with @xmath67 ( a ) , a solid - like behavior for @xmath68 ( b ) , and a disordered structure appears for @xmath69 ( c).,width=302 ]    we can understand the dynamical behavior of the system through its underlying structural properties . </S>",
    "<S> here we consider typically the simulation results obtained with @xmath11 at temperature @xmath58 . fluids modeled with two - length scales potential tend to display an ordered structure in bulk , which corresponds to the situation shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]a , where the confining nanotube has a large radius , @xmath70 . the ordered behavior and </S>",
    "<S> the resulting high flux reflects the quasi - discrete nature of the particle flow . </S>",
    "<S> the distance between the two peaks of density is approximately equal to @xmath2 , the first length scale of the core - softened potential . </S>",
    "<S> the fluid therefore experiences a solid - liquid - like behavior due to changes in relative positions of interacting particles from one density peak to another . </S>",
    "<S> the highly ordered density profile of the fluid observed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]b at the critical nanotube radius is responsible for the low particle flux . </S>",
    "<S> this solid - like state of minimum mobility appears as a special condition due to a combined action of confinement and the presence of two lengths scales in the potential . as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]c , ordering disappears under extreme confinement to generate a single - file flow of enhanced flux , where the particles are obliged to remain at the first length scale .     </S>",
    "<S> case at different values of temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the anomalous enhanced flux in narrow nanotubes is observed for both temperatures , and a second anomalous behavior is clear for low temperatures.,width=302 ]    finally , we investigate the fluid flow behavior in the nanotube for @xmath53 at different temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> a similar behavior is observed , with the minimum flux located at the same value of radius , as shown in fig  [ fig4]a for @xmath58 and @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , a second anomalous behavior is revealed at lower temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> the system at @xmath72 shows a anomalous flux increase in the region @xmath73 . looking in detail the curve for @xmath58 </S>",
    "<S> , the same behavior can be observed in the region @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> this anomaly occurs due to changes in the fluid structure from a double layer of flowing particles ( i.e. , a cylindrical layer near the nanotube wall and a linear central layer ) to a single cylindrical layer structure . for nanotubes with radius @xmath75 </S>",
    "<S> , the system displays the same double layer structure for both temperatures , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5]a . for @xmath76 , </S>",
    "<S> the single layer structure appears at @xmath58 , while the fluid at a lower temperature @xmath72 still flows through a double layer structure , as depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5]b . </S>",
    "<S> this change in the fluid conformation causes the observed flux anomaly , being a consequence of the competition between the fluid - fluid and the fluid - wall interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the fluid particles tends to form structures that increase the enthapic contribution to the free energy , minimizing it . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , the confinement imposes restrictions to ordering , increasing the entropic contribution to the free energy  @xcite . as a consequence , the transition from the structure with two to one single cylindrical layer takes palce first in systems at higher temperature , or higher entropic contribution . for sufficiently low values of the nanotube radius , </S>",
    "<S> the flowing system is characterized by a single cylindrical layer , regardless of the temperature , which is the case for @xmath76 , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5]c .     </S>",
    "<S> ( black circles ) and @xmath77 ( red stars ) , and radius ( a ) @xmath78 , ( b)@xmath76 and ( c ) @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> these results indicate that the transition from a double layer structure to a single cylindrical layers is temperature dependent . </S>",
    "<S> the snapshots show the different structures.,width=302 ]    in summary , here we studied the effect of confinement in the flow of particles interacting through core - softened potentials . in the presence of two competing length scales , </S>",
    "<S> our results show an anomalous non - monotonic behavior in the form of a global minimum flux with the nanotube radius , which is compatible with a transition from single - file flow to the flow of an ordered - like fluid . at increased values of the radius , </S>",
    "<S> a local minimum in the overall mass flux appears , which is more evident at low temperatures , and reflects the formation of a double - layer of flowing particles through the nanotube . </S>",
    "<S> these anomalous flow properties of core - softened particles in confined cylindrical geometries provide useful insight to the microscopical description of the flow behavior of liquid water in carbon nanotubes . </S>"
