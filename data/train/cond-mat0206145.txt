    "<S> models of one - dimensional driven diffusive systems sometimes exhibit an abrupt increase of the correlation length to an anomalously large but finite value as the parameters of the model are varied . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior may be misinterpreted as a genuine phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> a simple mechanism for this sharp increase is presented . </S>",
    "<S> the mechanism is introduced within the framework of a recently suggested correspondence between driven diffusive systems and zero - range processes . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that when the dynamics of the model is such that small domains are suppressed in the steady - state distribution , anomalously large correlation length may build up . </S>",
    "<S> the mechanism is examined in detail in two models .    </S>",
    "<S> driven diffusive systems have been studied extensively in recent years  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> particular attention has been given to one - dimensional models , which have been shown to behave very differently from systems in thermal equilibrium  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in contrast to equilibrium systems with short range interactions , non - equilibrium systems , characterized by dynamics which does not obey detailed balance , may exhibit spontaneous symmetry breaking and phase separation even when the dynamics is local .    </S>",
    "<S> it has recently been noted that numerical simulations may be rather misleading in attempting to determine whether or not a particular model exhibits phase separation . for example , direct numerical simulations of a single - lane three - species model introduced by arndt  @xcite ( ahr ) strongly indicate that two phase transitions take place in the model . </S>",
    "<S> the first transition is from a homogeneous state to a mixed state , in which the system separates into two phases : one with a high density and the other with a low density . in the second transition , which takes place from the latter state , the system further phase separates into three pure phases . </S>",
    "<S> analytical studies of the model @xcite have shown that the mixed state suggested by the numerical studies is in fact homogenous , and the model exhibits only one transition , from the homogeneous to the three - phase state . at the apparent transition to what was misinterpreted as a mixed state the model exhibits a sharp increase of its correlation length @xmath0 to an anomalously large but finite value . </S>",
    "<S> the change in @xmath0 is very sharp and it occurs over a narrow range of the parameters defining the model . such a behavior may be easily misinterpreted in numerical studies of systems smaller than @xmath0 as a genuine phase transition .    </S>",
    "<S> recently a simple criterion for the occurrence of phase separation in one - dimensional systems has been proposed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this criterion does not rely on direct numerical simulations , and it enables one to determine whether or not a particular model exhibits phase separation . </S>",
    "<S> it has been applied to a two - lane driven model , introduced by korniss  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> direct numerical simulations of this model have indicated that it exhibits phase separation in a region of its parameter space . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , numerical simulations , to be discussed below , show what seems like a sharp transition between a homogeneous and a phase separated states as the parameters defining the model are varied . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , the criterion conjectured in @xcite indicates that in fact this model , too , does not exhibit phase separation . </S>",
    "<S> thus the apparent phase separation observed in the numerical studies may again be due to a sharp crossover which results in a large but finite correlation length . </S>",
    "<S> the criterion @xcite addresses the issue of the existence of phase separation however it does not provide an understanding as to why the correlation length becomes anomalously large in certain cases , and why the increase in @xmath0 takes place over such a narrow range of model parameters .    in this letter we suggest a simple mechanism which accounts for the large correlation lengths and sharp crossover phenomena observed in some driven systems . </S>",
    "<S> we show that when the dynamics is such that small domains of the high density phase are suppressed in the steady state distribution , the resulting correlation length becomes anomalously large , leading to an apparent phase separation in numerical studies of finite systems . </S>",
    "<S> the mechanism is discussed within the framework put forward in @xcite . in this framework </S>",
    "<S> a correspondence is made between one - dimensional driven systems and zero - range processes . </S>",
    "<S> we use this correspondence to analyze the crossover phenomena observed in the ahr and the two - lane models , and discuss the underlying mechanism in detail .    </S>",
    "<S> we start by briefly reviewing the physical framework of the criterion introduced in @xcite . in this framework </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of the driven system is modelled by a zero - range process ( zrp ) . </S>",
    "<S> such a process @xcite is defined on a one - dimensional lattice of @xmath1 sites , or `` boxes '' , with periodic boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> particles , or `` balls '' , are distributed among the boxes , with the box @xmath2 occupied by @xmath3 balls . at each time step a box @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> is chosen at random and a ball is removed from it and transferred to one of its nearest neighbors with rate @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the rate @xmath4 depends only on the occupation number , @xmath3 , in that box . </S>",
    "<S> the steady - state weights of the zrp are known to have the form @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the fugacity , @xmath7 for @xmath8 , and @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the correspondence to driven systems is made by identifying occupied boxes with domains of the high density phase . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , a configuration of the driven system can be described as a sequence of high - density domains separated by low - density intervals . in the zrp , </S>",
    "<S> each high density domain is represented by a box , and the number of balls in that box corresponds to the domain length . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of the driven model may be studied by considering the currents flowing in and out of the high density domains . </S>",
    "<S> this dynamics may be represented by a zrp , with the rate @xmath10 taken as the current @xmath11 leaving a domain of size @xmath12 . within this picture </S>",
    "<S> , the existence of phase separation in the driven model corresponds to a macroscopic occupation of one of the boxes in the zrp .    in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> it was conjectured , based on the correspondence to a zrp , that the existence of phase separation is related to the asymptotic large @xmath12 behavior of the currents @xmath11 on blocks of size @xmath12 . for @xmath11 of the form </S>",
    "<S> @xmath13 with @xmath14 , the existence of phase separation depends only on the coefficient @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> phase separation takes place at high densities only if @xmath16 , and does not take place at any density if @xmath17 </S>",
    "<S> . moreover , when @xmath11 is asymptotically decreasing to zero at large @xmath12 , phase separation takes place at any density .    </S>",
    "<S> we now utilize the correspondence between the zrp and driven systems to gain insight into the sharp crossover phenomena discussed above in the ahr and two - lane models . </S>",
    "<S> we begin by considering the ahr model . </S>",
    "<S> this is a three - state model on a ring . </S>",
    "<S> each site is either empty ( @xmath18 ) , or occupied by a positive ( @xmath19 ) or a negative ( @xmath20 ) particle . </S>",
    "<S> the model evolves by a random sequential dynamics in which a pair of nearest neighbor sites is chosen at random and exchanged with the following rates : @xmath21 this dynamics conserves the densities of particles of each type . </S>",
    "<S> the two particle densities are taken to be equal . </S>",
    "<S> exact calculations within the grand - canonical ensemble @xcite have shown that this model has two states : a fully ordered state for @xmath22 , in which the system strongly phase separates into three phases ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath18 ) , and a disordered state for @xmath23 where particles and vacancies are homogeneously distributed . in the regime </S>",
    "<S> @xmath23 the current is an analytical function of @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the vicinity of a particular value @xmath25 ( which depends on @xmath26 and the density @xmath27 ) a sharp crossover takes place from a regime in which the correlation length @xmath0 is relatively small ( @xmath28 ) to a regime in which @xmath0 is anomalously large , but finite ( @xmath29 ) . in this regime </S>",
    "<S> the correlation length was found to reach values of the order @xmath30 for some range of the parameters . </S>",
    "<S> this makes it clear why numerical simulations of chains of length of the order of a few thousands suggest a phase - separated state for @xmath29 .    to make the correspondence of the ahr model to the zrp , </S>",
    "<S> high - density domains are identified as uninterrupted sequences of positive and negative particles , bounded by vacancies . </S>",
    "<S> the number of boxes @xmath1 in the zrp is equal to the number of vacancies in the ahr model , and the number of balls @xmath31 is equal to the number of positive and negative particles . </S>",
    "<S> hence the mean occupation of a box in the zrp , @xmath32 , is related to the density @xmath27 in the ahr by @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics within a domain is given by the rates for the positive and negative particles exchange in ( [ eq : rates ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the flow of particles in and out of a domain is controlled by the exchange rate @xmath26 of particles with vacancies .    </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics within each domain is thus given by the well studied partially asymmetric exclusion process ( pasep )  @xcite with particles injected and ejected from the boundaries with rate @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> for this process the asymptotic form of the current is known to take the form ( [ eq : jn ] ) with @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> the coefficient @xmath15 of the leading order correction is @xmath35 for @xmath36 , and @xmath37 for @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> note that in the case @xmath39 the current is an increasing function of the domain size . </S>",
    "<S> therefore small domains are more stable than large ones , and large correlation lengths can not build up . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore concentrate only on the regime @xmath40 , where the sharp crossover has been observed .    </S>",
    "<S> it has been noted that the domain size distribution of the ahr model is exactly given by that of the corresponding zrp @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> taking @xmath41 to order @xmath42 it is straightforward to show that for large @xmath12 the domain size distribution is given by @xmath43 with @xmath40 </S>",
    "<S> . the correlation length @xmath0 is determined by the equation for the density @xmath44 since @xmath17 a finite correlation length @xmath0 may be found for any density @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the distribution ( [ eq : dist ] ) is valid for any density and no phase separation takes place in this case . on the other hand for @xmath16 the distribution ( [ eq : dist ] ) can support only sufficiently low densities , and therefore one expects phase separation at high densities , with a macroscopic occupation of one of the boxes , in analogy to bose - einstein condensation . to this order , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 is determined by the density , and is independent of @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the @xmath24 dependence of @xmath0 and the sharp crossover observed in simulations must come from higher order corrections to the current . </S>",
    "<S> as will be shown below , the main effect of these corrections is to suppress the small domains . </S>",
    "<S> this results in a large correlation length in the system .    </S>",
    "<S> 5 cm 5 cm    to demonstrate this point we first consider @xmath11 to order @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore study the zrp with the currents @xmath11 given by @xmath47 in making the correspondence to the ahr model we take @xmath40 , and note that to leading order in @xmath48 the current @xmath11 takes the form  @xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50 is independent of @xmath24 . expanding this expression in powers of @xmath42 </S>",
    "<S> we find that to leading order in @xmath48 , the coefficient @xmath51 diverges as @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , @xmath51 ( and in fact all higher - order corrections ) is @xmath24-dependent , and becomes large near @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> using the form ( [ eq : jtoy ] ) of the current , the domains size distribution for large @xmath12 ( [ eq : dist ] ) becomes @xmath54 the value of @xmath0 for a given density is determined by ( [ eq : phi ] ) , and is therefore a function of @xmath51 . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : xiofc ] we plot this function for several values of the density @xmath45 . for any density the correlation length @xmath0 exhibits two distinct regions in @xmath51 with a sharp crossover between them but no singularity . </S>",
    "<S> for small @xmath51 the correlation length seems to increase exponentially with @xmath51 , while for large @xmath51 the increase appears to be faster than exponential . </S>",
    "<S> this can be seen in the inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : xiofc ] , where we zoom on a very narrow range of values of @xmath51 at the crossover . the crossover point increases with @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> since , as argued before , @xmath51 of the ahr model diverges at @xmath53 , we expect the crossover value to take place for some @xmath23 , as observed in direct numerical simulations of the model and in accordance with the exact results .    </S>",
    "<S> we now note that a similar sharp crossover phenomenon also takes place when one considers the behavior of the current as a function of the density . within the zrp </S>",
    "<S> the quantity which corresponds to the current of the ahr model is @xmath55 where @xmath41 is given by the current @xmath11 of ( [ eq : jtoy ] ) to order @xmath46 with @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> it is straightforward to show that in the grand - canonical ensemble @xmath57 . using this relation , we plot @xmath58 as function of @xmath45 for fixed values of @xmath51 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : jofrho ] . here </S>",
    "<S> again two distinct regions can be observed for sufficiently large @xmath51 . at low </S>",
    "<S> density @xmath58 exhibits a noticeable increase with @xmath45 , while it slowly approaches its maximal value @xmath59 at high densities . </S>",
    "<S> between the two regimes one finds a sharp crossover but no singularity . </S>",
    "<S> the current density relation obtained here for the zrp has the same features as that of the ahr model ( compare fig . 2 of @xcite to fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : jofrho ] here ) . to get a better understanding of this behavior </S>",
    "<S> , we note that the effect of large @xmath51 on the domain size distribution is to suppress the weight of small domains . </S>",
    "<S> this results in a large correlation length needed to sustain the density . in the ahr model , where the correspondence to the zrp is exact , this suppression </S>",
    "<S> is achieved by large high - order corrections to the current @xmath11 . from fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : xiofc ] it can be seen that for a given density the sharp crossover occurs only for sufficiently large @xmath51 . in this case </S>",
    "<S> it is evident that the high - order corrections can take high enough values as @xmath24 is increased , since these corrections diverge at @xmath53 . however , in other models this suppression may be induced by other mechanisms , which do not require large high - order corrections to the current of the form discussed above . to demonstrate this point we consider a zrp defined by the transition rates @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are free parameters , and @xmath61 directly controls the weight of small domains . </S>",
    "<S> sufficiently large @xmath61 destabilizes small domains and suppresses them in the steady - state distribution . </S>",
    "<S> this model with @xmath63 has been discussed previously in the context of zrp and demonstrated to exhibit a sharp crossover by evans  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a straightforward calculation leads to the domain size distribution @xmath64 with @xmath65 and @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the @xmath67 expression is valid only for large @xmath12 . in order to suppress small domains </S>",
    "<S> one needs @xmath68 which yields @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> larger @xmath62 or @xmath61 result in a stronger suppression of small domains , increasing the weight of the tail of the distribution . </S>",
    "<S> we have calculated @xmath70 as a function of @xmath61 for fixed density , and found that it exhibits similar features to those of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : xiofc ] , with a sharp crossover taking place at a value of @xmath61 which decreases with @xmath62 . for example , for @xmath71 , the crossover takes place at @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> we thus conclude that the sharp crossover is a direct result of suppression of small domains . the suppression of small domains results in an increase of the tail of the domain size distribution in order to keep the average density of particles . </S>",
    "<S> this results in a larger correlation length . </S>",
    "<S> of course , the details of the suppression mechanism may differ from model to model , and will affect the exact from of the distribution .    5 cm 5 cm    we now turn to consider the two - lane model introduced in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the model is defined on a @xmath73 periodic lattice , where each site is either empty , or occupied by a positive or a negative particle . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics within a lane is governed by the rates ( [ eq : rates ] ) with @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> particles are also allowed to hop between lanes with the rates @xmath75 direct numerical simulations suggest that for large @xmath26 the model exhibits phase separation  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> this model has recently been studied  @xcite using its conjectured correspondence to the zrp , where the existence of a phase transition is determined by the leading finite - size correction to the current . </S>",
    "<S> it was suggested that the model does not exhibit phase separation . in analogy with the analysis of the ahr model , </S>",
    "<S> the current of a finite domain has been studied by considering an open system of length @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> this system is fully occupied by positive and negative particles . in the interior </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics follows the same rates of the model given by eqs . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : rates ] and [ eq : twolanerates ] , although here there are no vacancies . at the boundaries positive ( negative ) particles </S>",
    "<S> are injected with rate @xmath26 at the left ( right ) . </S>",
    "<S> this automatically implies that particles are removed at the other end with the same rate @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics within a domain is therefore given by the particle exchange rates ( [ eq : rates ] ) and ( [ eq : twolanerates ] ) with @xmath74 in the interior , together with the following rates at the boundaries of both lanes @xmath76 this is a generalization of the totally asymmetric exclusion process with open boundary conditions to two lanes . </S>",
    "<S> for this model no analytical expression for the current @xmath11 of a domain of size @xmath12 is available . </S>",
    "<S> extensive numerical studies  @xcite have shown that the asymptotic form of the current is given by eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : jn ] with @xmath77 for any @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the model does not phase separate at any value of the parameters . </S>",
    "<S> however , as in the ahr model , keeping the density fixed one observes in numerical simulations of finite systems a sharp crossover in the current as the parameter @xmath26 is changed . </S>",
    "<S> this can be seen , for example , in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : twolanecurr ] , where the current @xmath79 of a two - lane system is plotted as a function of @xmath26 . here , </S>",
    "<S> too , the sharp crossover seen in simulations may be misinterpreted as a phase transition .    </S>",
    "<S> we now show that in the regime where phase separation seems to take place , the statistical weight of small domains is suppressed , in accordance with the mechanism suggested above . to this end </S>",
    "<S> we have studied the domain size distribution in the two - lane model by direct numerical simulations ( see fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : hist ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is instructive to compare these results with the distribution function ( [ eq : dist ] ) with @xmath80 , obtained from the zrp where small domains are not destabilized . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that small domains in the two - lane system are significantly suppressed as compared with this distribution . </S>",
    "<S> this suppression is easily understood since small domains which form on one lane can readily dissolve through the exchange to the other lane . as discussed above this could lead to a sharp crossover in the correlation length . for comparison we also plot the distribution function ( [ eq : distwn0 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> although one does not expect the details of the distribution to agree it is evident that the general behavior is captured .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> a simple mechanism for the occurrence of a sharp crossover to anomalously large correlation length exhibited in some driven systems is suggested . </S>",
    "<S> the mechanism is examined in detail for two models , and is shown to be consistent with analytical results in one model , and with numerical results in the other .    </S>",
