    "today is widely acknowledged that for the proper management of assets and prices ( and the related investment risks ) it is required the proper modeling of the return distribution of financial assets .",
    "for instance , the answer to whether it is possible to beat the market except by chance depends on whether stock market prices display long memory and how probable are very large price fluctuations .",
    "the crucial difficulty is , however , that the financial market is a very complex system ; it has a large number of non - linearly interacting internal elements , and is highly sensible to the action of external forces .",
    "even more , the real challenge here is that the number of the system constituents , and the details of their interactions and of the external factors acting upon it are actually barely known .",
    "physicists have a long tradition of dealing with similar systems .",
    "the statistical description of systems of many particles was developed in parallel with the statistical analysis of market dynamics @xcite .",
    "for instance , taking into account the wide applicability of the central limit theorem , bachelier assumed that the return over a given time scale is the consequence of many independent ",
    "microscopic \" events , which then lead to a normal distribution of returns .",
    "thus , he modeled their dynamics as an uncorrelated random walk with independent , identically gaussian distributed random variables , i.e. , as a brownian motion @xcite .",
    "since then , the gaussian assumption for the distribution of returns has been frequently used in mathematical finance and is one of the key assumptions behind the classic black - scholes option pricing formula @xcite , which is based on a wiener process in the continuous - time setting or on appropriate discrete - time versions such as binomial trees .    thought",
    "the simplifications the normal distribution provides in analytical calculation are very valuable , empirical studies @xcite show that the distribution of returns has a tail heavier than that of a gaussian . to illustrate this fact , we show in fig.[fig : histo ]    the histogram for daily logarithm differences of the mexican ipc index from april 9th , 2000 to april 9th , 2010 .",
    "clearly , large events are very frequent in the data , a fact largely underestimated by a gaussian process and of upmost importance for financial management .",
    "it is remarkable that such a feature is present in quite different markets @xcite .",
    "one of the skills of physicists is the search for universal laws , i.e. , common features in most particular realizations of a general class of phenomena .",
    "this can be done even if the  microscopic \" details distinguishing each case are not fully understood .",
    "heavy tailed distributions are commonly described by a power law ( at least in a range of scales ) , which in turn implies scale invariance , a distinct signature of fractals .",
    "fractals have been shown to be a common geometrical pattern in many natural systems .",
    "finally , many of these systems may be in a state of self - organized criticality , a paradigm that would explain how organization arises in complex systems and make them more predictable .",
    "this could be also the case for other dynamical systems outside the realm of natural sciences . in his pioneering analysis of cotton prices , mandelbrot @xcite ( the founder of fractal geometry )",
    "observed that in addition to being non - gaussian , the process of returns shows another interesting property : time scaling , that is , the distributions of returns for various choices of @xmath3 , ranging from one day up to one month have similar functional forms .",
    "as it was already mentioned , observed stock market prices are assumed to be the sum of many small terms , hence a statistical model to describe them must be such that the sum of two independent random variables having the given distribution ( with a parameter @xmath1 describing the decay of the tail ) yields again the same kind of distribution ( with the same value of @xmath1 ) . motivated by these empirical findings and reasoning , mandelbrot proposed that the returns can be modeled as a kind of stable process introduced by lvy in 1925@xcite .",
    "lvy stable distributions are attractive because they are supported by the generalized central limit theorem .",
    "the theorem states that stable laws are the only possible limit distributions for properly normalized and centered sums of independent , identically distributed random variables .",
    "an issue here is whether the underlying distributions are actually stable .",
    "stability only holds for @xmath4 $ ] and some authors have found that the tails of some financial time series have to be modeled with @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "conclusive results on the distribution of returns are difficult to obtain , and require a large amount of data to study the rare events that give rise to the fat tails @xcite .",
    "another issue is that according with cont @xcite , in order for a parametric distributional model to reproduce the properties of the empirical distribution it must have at least four parameters : a location parameter , a scale parameter , a parameter describing the decay of the tails and an asymmetry parameter .",
    "and we know of several other heavy - tailed alternative distributions ( such as student s t , hyperbolic or normal inverse gaussian ) which fullfil this condition . therefore , in order to grasp the universal laws behind markets dynamics , it is important to keep accumulating empirical facts about the statistics of different financial indices around the world .",
    "the aim of this paper is to provide a rigourous statistical analysis of log - return daily fluctuations of the ipc , the leading mexican stock market index . after considering the gaussian , normal inverse gaussian and lvy distributions",
    ", we found that this last provides the best fit and we show that the corresponding @xmath1 is indeed in the range for a stable lvy distribution .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we review the basic properties of lvy - stable distributions . in section [ sec : stats ] we proceed to introduce and analize the ipc data . in section [ sec : comparison ]",
    "we discuss the similarities and disagreements between our results and results in previous works .",
    "finally we present our conclusions in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "lvy - stable distributions were introduced by paul lvy @xcite during his investigations of the behavior of sums of independent random variables .",
    "a lvy skew alpha - stable distribution is specified by scale @xmath6 , exponent @xmath1 , skewness parameter @xmath7 and a location parameter @xmath8 .",
    "since the analytical form of the levy stable distribution is known only for a few cases , they are generally specified by their characteristic function .",
    "the most popular parameterization is defined by samorodnitsky , g. and taqqu , @xcite with the characteristic function : @xmath9 \\right ) } , & \\text{if $ \\alpha=1$}.\\\\      \\exp{\\left(-\\gamma^\\alpha |t|^\\alpha \\left[1-i\\beta\\tan\\left(\\frac{\\pi \\alpha}2\\right ) { \\rm sign}(t ) + i\\mu t\\right ] \\right ) } , & \\text{otherwise}.    \\end{cases}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 stands for the sign of @xmath3 .",
    "then , the probability density function is calculated from with the inverse fourier transform in the form : @xmath11    lvy distributions are characterized by the property of being stable under convolution , i.e , the sum of two independent and identically lvy - distributed random variables , is also lvy distributed with the same stability index @xmath1 .",
    "the stability parameter @xmath1 lies in the interval @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "small @xmath1 represents a sharp peak but heavy tails which asymptotically decay as power laws with exponent @xmath13 . for the normal distribution @xmath14 . for the symmetric distributions ( like the normal distribution ) , the skewness parameter @xmath15 .",
    "the skewness parameter must lie in the range @xmath16 $ ] .",
    "when @xmath17 , one tail vanishes completely .",
    "the parameter @xmath6 lies in the interval @xmath18 , while the location parameter @xmath8 is in @xmath19 .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour of the lvy distributions is described by the expression @xmath20 hence , the variance of the levy stable distributions is infinite for all @xmath21 .",
    "the dependence on @xmath1 is illustrated in the semilog plots in figure [ fig : levypdf ] .    in our computations the stable library developed by nolan was used .",
    "our ipc data set covers the period from april , 2000 to april , 2010 , and comprises 2502 returns .",
    "the index was label as @xmath22 and the data is written as the successive differences of the natural logarithm of the returns , @xmath23 the daily closure values of the ipc were used , so @xmath24 day .",
    "[ fig : series ]    displays the index value as a function of trading day and the corresponding histogram for @xmath25 is presented in figure [ fig : histo ] . in table",
    "[ tab : stats ]    .mean variance , skewness and kurtosis of the ipc log - return time series . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as can be observed in table [ tab : longrun ] , for @xmath26 a value of @xmath27 was obtained which is also outside the levy regime .",
    "these simulations suggest that high frequency data is needed in order to obtain reliable results while estimating the tail index[12 ] .",
    "the results obtained in section 3.1 are in general in agreement with previous results obtained in @xcite , where a better fit than the gaussian was obtained for the nig distribution . in that paper the data set under analysis covered the period january , 1993-january 2003 , and",
    "comprises 2505 returns .",
    "the ks goodness of fit analysis was performed at the @xmath28 significance level .",
    "a clear rejection of normality was obtained by those authors . at this",
    "significance level their fit of the data using a nig was not rejected .",
    "nevertheless , our results clearly show that the @xmath1-stable distribution provides a better fit than the nig distribution for daily fluctuations of the ipc data .",
    "the three tests we have used forceful rejected that the data of the mexican financial index , ipc , is normally distributed . likewise , at the @xmath2 significance level , the corresponding tests force us to reject the null hypothesis of the data being distributed as a normal inverse gaussian . on the other hand ,",
    "the null hypothesis that our sample comes from @xmath1-stable levy distribution can not be rejected at the @xmath2 significance level .",
    "our analysis of the impact of the sample size on the estimation of the tail index confirms that high frequency data is needed in order to determine whether or not a given distribution is stable .",
    "of the three distributions we have considered , the @xmath1-stable distribution provides the best fit for daily fluctuations of the ipc data .",
