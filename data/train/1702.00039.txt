    "we have seen that @xmath148 is self - dual and it is of the form ( [ kl ] ) , so @xmath149 by symmetry between @xmath34 and @xmath35 we have that @xmath150    it is easy to see that @xmath151 .",

    "this is the basic insight of the following example .",
    "kazhdan - lusztig polynomials were discovered ( or invented ) in 1979 , but it was only in 1990 that matthew dyer gave a formula @xcite to calculate inductively the kazhdan - lusztig basis for a universal coxeter system ( we will not reproduce here the proof , although it is not a difficult one ) . in this case , every element has only one expression as a product of elements of @xmath6 .",
