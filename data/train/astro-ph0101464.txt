    "does @xmath9 vary over the starburst region ? and does it correlate with the observed physical conditions of the molecular gas ? with these goals in mind , we obtained @xmath11 resolution owens valley millimeter interferometer images of c@xmath1o(2 - 1 ) , c@xmath1(1 - 0 ) , 2.6 mm and 1.3 mm continuum of the central region of ic 342 , giving spatial resolutions of @xmath12 pc .",

    "aperture synthesis observations of both c@xmath1o(1 - 0 ) ( 109.782 ghz ) and c@xmath1o(2 - 1 ) ( 219.560 ghz ) were made with the owens valley radio observatory ( ovro ) millimeter interferometer between 1997 october 22 and 1997 december 15 ( table 2 ) .",
    "the interferometer consists of six 10.4 meter antennas with cryogenically cooled sis receivers @xcite .",

    "the true noise level is slightly lower ( @xmath19 ) at the phase centers and somewhat higher towards the edge of the primary beams .",
    "all further data reduction was done with the nrao aips package . in making the zeroth moment ( integrated intensity ) maps ,",
    "only emission greater than 1.2@xmath20 was included . due to the fact that the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) is lower in the c@xmath1o(2 - 1 ) map , the choice of 1.2@xmath20 could , in principle , lower the integrated intensities of the c@xmath1o(2 - 1 ) map relative to the higher sensitivity c@xmath1o(1 - 0 ) map .",
    "however , the ratio of the integrated intensity maps made with no clipping is identical to those with clipping to within 5% , indicating this effect is not important .",

    "the basic morphology of the nuclear mini - spiral seen in c@xmath1o(1 - 0 ) is similar to the @xmath4co(1 - 0 ) transition , but there are noticeable differences",
    ". observations of @xmath4co and hcn show that there are five major peaks of molecular gas in the nucleus @xcite .",
    "gmc c , along the northern arm , is brightest in @xmath4co , gmc b is the molecular cloud associated with the starburst , and gmc a is the nearest to the dynamical center of ic 342 .",
    "gmcs d and e are more distant gmcs along the northern and southern arms , respectively .",
    "all gmcs except gmc a are readily seen in c@xmath1o(1 - 0 ) .",
    "gmc a is substantially weaker in the 1 - 0 transition of c@xmath1o relative to the @xmath4co(1 - 0 ) transition .",
    "however , in the 2 - 1 transition of c@xmath1o , gmc a is similar in relative strength .",
    "the weakness of gmc a in c@xmath1o(1 - 0 ) is probably a temperature effect (  3.2.1 ) .",
    "another difference is that c@xmath1o(1 - 0 ) distribution , like @xmath5co(1 - 0 ) @xcite , appears more symmetric than @xmath4co(1 - 0 ) . in @xmath4co(1 - 0 ) , the northern arm is brighter than the southern arm by about 50% ( the integrated flux of the entire northern arm is 1200 jy km s@xmath14 , while the entire southern arm is 800 jy km s@xmath14 ) . in c@xmath1o(1",
    "- 0 ) it is only @xmath715% percent brighter ( the integrated flux of the entire northern arm is 15.4@xmath242.5 jy km s@xmath14 , as compared to 13.6@xmath242 jy km s@xmath14 for the southern arms ) .",
    "c@xmath1o(1 - 0 ) preferentially arises from the outside ( leading ) edges of the arms , similar to the @xmath5co(1 - 0 ) , while @xmath4co(1 - 0 ) comes from broad arms with abundant diffuse emission upstream from the arms .",
    "the less abundant isotopomers do not show the broad diffuse arms nearly as dramatically as the @xmath4co @xcite .",
    "although the sensitivity of the c@xmath1o(1 - 0 ) maps are not extremely high , the high sensitivity @xmath5co(1 - 0 ) line displays the same trend .",
    "these differences between @xmath4co and the rarer isotopes can be understood if the geometry and excitation of the nuclear gas clouds are considered .      from figure 4",
    ", it can be seen that the two molecular arms in the nucleus of ic 342 progress inward and wrap around the central starburst .",
    "the arms appear to terminate in a partial ring surrounding the burst . if the two arms are due to a trailing density waves with orbital motions predicted for barred spiral arms outside of the inner lindblad resonance ( ilr ) ( eg .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , then the velocity pattern implies the northern arm is behind the starburst in projection and the southern arm is in front .",
    "comparisons of h@xmath25 to thermal radio continuum and observations of b@xmath26/h@xmath25 confirm that extinction towards the southern portion of the starburst complex is substantially higher than towards the north ( figure 4 ; figure 5 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this geometry implies that from our perspective , we are seeing the `` starburst lit '' face of the molecular clouds when viewing the northern arm ( seeing the surface pdr regions ) , and the `` backside '' of the molecular clouds for the southern arm ( seeing the ambient molecular gas ) . for optically thick transitions such as those of @xmath4co , which trace the cloud photospheres @xcite",
    ", the lines should appear brighter along the northern arm relative to the southern arm , hence are sensitive to temperature effects .",
    "whereas the optically thin transitions will trace column density .",
    "therefore this asymmetric pattern can manifest itself in optically thick transitions , but not in transitions that are either inherently optically thin due to opacity , or effectively thin due to large velocity gradients .",
    "because of its low opacity and higher critical density , c@xmath1o(2 - 1 ) emission , like @xmath5co(2 - 1 ) , is dominated by the dense giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) seen in hcn emission @xcite .",
    "the c@xmath1o(2 - 1 ) observations have the highest spatial resolution yet obtained ( @xmath7 13 pc ) in ic 342 , sufficient to resolve the nuclear gmcs into substructure .",
    "c@xmath1o(2 - 1 ) is used to derive the properties of the individual gmcs .",
    "each cloud , identified only as a region of spatially and spectrally localized emission , not necessarily a gravitationally bound entity , has been fit with an elliptical gaussian to determine its size , linewidth , location and intensity .",
    "of the five gmcs identified by @xcite , only gmcs a , b , c and e are fit since gmc d is at the edge of the c@xmath1o(2 - 1 ) primary beam .",
    "the four major gmcs are resolved into eight components ( numbers are added to the letter designations in the case of substructure ) .",
    "the results of the fits are tabulated in table 4 .",
    "all clouds are resolved ( fitted sizes @xmath81/2 the fwhm of the beamsize ) except cloud c3 .",
    "the gmcs are composed of several smaller clouds that are @xmath27 pc in size , with masses of about @xmath28 and fwhm linewidths of 20 - 30 @xmath22 .",
    "the gmcs tend to be non - spherical with axial ratios @xmath72 and position angles generally oriented in the direction of the spiral arms .",
    "this is consistent with the presence of arm streaming motions over the nuclear region @xcite .",
    "beam averaged densities for the molecular clouds that make up the gmcs are @xmath29 (  3.2.3 ) .",
    "these values are quite similar to those found for the `` envelope '' of the galactic center gmc , sgr b2 ( eg . , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) .",
    "comparisons between rotational lines with different j states of optically thin transitions allow for the mapping of gas excitation temperatures ( t@xmath13 ) . generally , the main isotopomers of co are optically thick in galactic nuclei and as such are of little use in constraining t@xmath13 ( eg .",
    "moreover , gradients in temperature over small scales appear to dominate the @xmath4co line ratios rather than t@xmath13 @xcite . optically thin line ratios , on the other hand , can be quite constraining , making the c@xmath1o(2 - 1)/c@xmath1o(1 - 0 ) line ratio a sensitive measure of t@xmath13 in ic 342 .",

    ". ratios of integrated intensities are used instead of the peak main - beam temperatures to increase the s / n .",
    "this requires that the c@xmath1o(2 - 1 ) and c@xmath1o(1 - 0 ) line profiles be the same .",
    "this is a good approximation ( compare figure 1 and 2 ) . in generating the ratio maps , the integrated intensity maps for c@xmath1o(2 - 1 ) and c@xmath1o(1 - 0 ) were convolved to matching beamsizes , divided , and blanked anywhere where emission was @xmath35 in either map .",
    "errors in the ratio maps are conservatively estimated to be @xmath3635% in magnitude and @xmath37 in position .",
    "aside from the two peaks seen in the ratio map , the c@xmath1o(2 - 1)/c@xmath1o(1 - 0 ) ratio map has relatively constant values of 0.7 - 1.3 over much of the central mapped region , with lower values preferentially found in the south .",
    "the highest c@xmath1o(2 - 1)/c@xmath1o(1 - 0 ) peak , with a value of 2.2 , is found at the starburst region .",
    "the heating source for the warm molecular gas at this location is probably the massive stars of the starburst .",
    "the second ratio peak is at gmc a. gmc a is unusual in that it is not near either of the major radio continuum sources (  3.3 ) , which suggests that the heating of gmc a is not due to star formation .",
    "some dynamical heating mechanism may be at work here , such as shock heating due to large scale bar - driven gas flows , which is consistent with the fact that it is the gmc closest to the dynamical center of the galaxy , and to the ring of hot shocked gas seen in h@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "a map of t@xmath13 for the nuclear region derived using the c@xmath1(2 - 1)/c@xmath1(1 - 0 ) ratio is displayed in figure 5b .",

    "the implied filling factors are @xmath43 , which given the different beamsizes , are consistent with those found for @xmath5co .",
    "this implies that the c@xmath1o(2 - 1 ) emission detected arises predominately from the same molecular gas component as the @xmath5co(2 - 1 ) emission @xcite .",
    "comparison of the abundant and optically thick @xmath4co line with its less abundant and thinner cousins , @xmath5co and c@xmath1o , can be used to trace optical depths and place limits on isotopic abundances .",
    "the isotopic line ratios are displayed in figure 6a - c and table 3 .",

    "regions that are blanked due to low s / n tend to correspond to high @xmath4co / c@xmath1o ratios since the weakness of the c@xmath1o(1 - 0 ) line is the limiting factor . at the sites of the gmcs ,",

    "as in the galactic center @xcite , variations in this ratio in the nucleus of ic 342 are substantial over small ( @xmath730 pc ) spatial scales .",
    "the highest column density regions at peaks b , c , and e tend to have the lowest isotopic ratios .",
    "this is expected since these are presumably the optically thickest regions .",
    "the central trough region has surprisingly low values of @xmath4co / c@xmath1o and @xmath5co / c@xmath1o line ratios .",
    "the central trough region , which is a site of weak emission in all observed transitions , is the only firmly established region of optically thin @xmath5co gas over the central distribution @xcite . as such",

    "surprisingly , both isotopic ratios , @xmath4co / c@xmath1o = 24 and @xmath5co / c@xmath1o = 3.2 , are @xmath47 here than the average across the rest of the spiral arms ( c@xmath1o overluminous ) . along the spiral arms , the @xmath4co tends to dominate c@xmath1o ( highest ratios ) on the upstream sides of the arms .",
    "c@xmath1o becomes relatively more prominent as one moves towards the leading edge of the spiral arms ( low ratios ) .",
    "the same effect is seen in @xmath4co/@xmath5co observations with higher sensitivity to extended structure @xcite .",
    "much of the structure seen in the isotopic ratio maps appear to be due to excitation effects .",
    "the peak in the @xmath4co / c@xmath1o ratio map at gmc a and towards the starburst near gmc b result from depopulation of the 1 - 0 level in the optically thin c@xmath1o due to the increased t@xmath13 , as confirmed by the high c@xmath1o(2 - 1)/c@xmath1o(1 - 0 ) ratios .",
    "the trend of decreasing ratio counter - clockwise across the arms likely results from changes in density across the spiral arm due to the density wave @xcite .",
    "the variation in excitation demonstrates the importance of observing higher j transitions when dealing with optically thin transitions .",
    "if one relies , as is often the case for extragalactic studies , on just the observations of the ( 1 - 0 ) transition of co and its isotopomers , it is possible that variations in excitation can be mistaken for variations in morphological structure or column density .",

    "the low ratios in this region imply that c@xmath1o is overabundant relative to @xmath4co and @xmath5co .",
    "neither isotope - selective photodissociation nor isotope - selective fractionation can be the explanation because in both cases the abundance of @xmath4co and @xmath5co are predicted to be larger relative to c@xmath1o , not smaller @xcite .",
