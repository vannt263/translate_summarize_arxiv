    "bootstrap percolation on a graph @xmath10 is defined as the spread of _ activation _ or _ infection _ according to the following rule , with a given threshold @xmath11 : we start with a set @xmath12 of _ active _ vertices .",
    "each inactive vertex that has at least @xmath3 active neighbors becomes active .",
    "this is repeated until no more vertices become active , that is , when no inactive vertex has @xmath3 or more active neighbors .",
    "active vertices never become inactive , so the set of active vertices grows monotonously .    to avoid confusion , we will use the terminology that each active vertex _ infects _ all its neighbors , so that a vertex that is infected ( at least ) @xmath3 times becomes active .",
    "we are mainly interested in the final size @xmath13 of the active set , and in particular whether eventually all vertices will be active or not .",
    "if they are , we say that the initial set @xmath14 _ percolates _ ( completely ) .",
    "we will study a  sequence of graphs of order @xmath15 ; we then also say that ( a sequence of ) @xmath14 _ almost percolates _ if the number of vertices that remain inactive is @xmath9 , that is , if @xmath16 .",
    "bootstrap percolation on a lattice ( which is a  special example of a  cellular automata ) was introduced in 1979 by chalupa , leath and reich @xcite as a  simplified model of some magnetic systems .",
    "since then bootstrap percolation has been studied on various graphs , both deterministic and random .",
    "one can study either a  random initial set or the deterministic problem of choosing an initial set that is optimal in some sense .",
    "a simple example of the latter is the classical folklore problem to find the minimal percolating set in a two - dimensional grid ( i.e. , a finite square @xmath17 ^ 2 $ ] in the square lattice ) ; see balogh and pete @xcite and bollobs @xcite .",
    "( these references also treat higher - dimensional grids @xmath17^d$ ] . )",
    "another extremal problem is studied by morris @xcite .",
    "the problem with a random initial set was introduced by chalupa , leath and reich @xcite ( lattices and regular infinite tree ) , and further studied on lattices by schonmann @xcite ; it has , in particular , been studied on finite grids ( in two dimensions or more ) , see aizenman and lebowitz @xcite , balogh and pete  @xcite , cerf and cirillo @xcite , cerf and manzo @xcite , holroyd @xcite , balogh , bollobs and morris @xcite , gravner , holroyd and morris @xcite . in a recent paper , balogh et al .",
    "@xcite derived a sharp asymptotic for the critical density ( i.e. , the critical size of a random initial set ) for bootstrap percolation on grids of any dimension , generalizing results of balogh , bollobs , and morris @xcite .",
    "grids with a different edge set where studied by holroyd , liggett and romik @xcite .",
    "the study of bootstrap percolation on lattices is partly explained by its origin in statistical physics , and the bootstrap process is being successfully used in studies of the ising model ; see @xcite . lately",
    "bootstrap percolation has also been studied on varieties of graphs different from lattices and grids ; see , for example , balogh and bollobs @xcite ( hypercube ) ; balogh , peres and pete @xcite ( infinite trees ) ; balogh and pittel @xcite , janson @xcite ( random regular graphs ) ; an extension where the threshold may vary between the vertices is studied by amini @xcite . an anisotropic bootstrap percolation was studied by duminil - copin and van enter @xcite .",
    "further , a graph bootstrap percolation model introduced by bollobs @xcite already in 1968 , where edges are infected instead of vertices , was analyzed recently by balogh , bollobs and morris  @xcite and balogh et al .",
    "@xcite .    in the present paper , we study bootstrap percolation on the erds  rnyi random graph @xmath0 with an initial set @xmath14 consisting of a given number @xmath18 of vertices chosen at random .",
    "( by symmetry , we obtain the same results for any deterministic set of @xmath18 vertices . ) recall that @xmath0 is the random graph on the set of vertices @xmath19 where all possible edges between pairs of different vertices are present independently and with the same probability  @xmath20 . as usual",
    ", we let @xmath7 depend on @xmath4 .",
    "a problem equivalent to bootstrap percolation on @xmath0 in the case @xmath21 was studied by scalia - tomba @xcite , although he used a different formulation as an epidemic .",
    "( ball and britton @xcite study a more general model with different degrees of severity of infection . ) otherwise , bootstrap percolation on @xmath0 was first studied by vallier @xcite ; we here use a simple method ( the same as @xcite ) that allows us to both simplify the proofs and improve the results .",
    "we will state the results for a general fixed @xmath11 ( the case @xmath22 is much different ; see remark  [ r1 ] ) ; the reader may for simplicity consider the case @xmath23 only , since there are no essential differences for higher @xmath3 .",
    "we will see that there is a threshold phenomenon : typically , either the final size @xmath13 is small ( at most twice the initial size @xmath18 ) , or it is large [ sometimes exactly @xmath4 , but if @xmath20 is so small that there are vertices of degree less than @xmath3 , these can never become active except initially so eventually at most @xmath8 will become infected ] .",
    "we can study the threshold in two ways : in the first version , we keep @xmath4 and @xmath20 fixed and vary @xmath18 . in the second version",
    ", we fix @xmath4 and  @xmath18 and vary @xmath20 .",
    "we will state some results for both versions and some for the former version only ; these too can easily be translated to the second version .",
    "we will also study dynamical versions , where we add new external infections or activations or new edges until we reach the threshold ; see section  [ sdyn ] .",
    "apart from the final size @xmath13 , we will also study the time @xmath24 the bootstrap process takes until completion .",
    "we count the time in _ generations _ : generation  0 is @xmath14 , generation 1 is the set of other vertices that have at least @xmath3 neighbors in generation  0 , and so on .",
    "the process stops as soon as there is an empty generation , and we let @xmath24 be the number of ( nonempty ) generations . thus ,",
    "if we let @xmath25 be the set of vertices activated in generation @xmath26 , then @xmath27    bootstrap percolation does not seem to be a good model for usual infectious diseases ; see , however , ball and britton @xcite .",
    "it might be a better model for the spread of rumors or other ideas or beliefs ; cf .",
    "the well - known rule , `` what i tell you three times is true '' in carroll @xcite .",
    "bootstrap percolation can be also viewed as a simplified model for propagation of activity in a neural network .",
    "although related neuronal models are too involved for a rigorous analysis ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) they inspired study of bootstrap percolation on @xmath0 by vallier @xcite .",
    "there is a further discussion on the application of bootstrap percolation on @xmath0 to neuromodelling in @xcite .    instead of @xmath0",
    ", one might consider the random graph @xmath28 , with a given number @xmath29 of edges .",
    "it is easy to obtain a  result for @xmath28 from our results for @xmath0 , using monotonicity , but we usually leave this to the reader . [ in the dynamical model in section  [ ssdynm ] , we consider @xmath28 , however . ]",
    "an alternative to starting with an initial active set of fixed size @xmath18 is to let each vertex be initially activated with probability @xmath30 , with different vertices activated independently .",
    "note that this is the same as taking the initial size @xmath18 random with @xmath31 . for most results the resulting random variation in @xmath18 in negligible , and we obtain the same results as for @xmath32 , but for the gaussian limit in theorems [ tac][tac0 ] and  [ tdg2 ] , the asymptotic variances are changed by constant factors .",
    "we leave the details to the reader .",
    "some open problems arise from our study . in @xcite ,",
    "balogh , bollobs and morris determine the critical probability for bootstrap percolation on grids when the dimension @xmath33 .",
    "a similar idea translated to the @xmath34 graph would be to study what happens when @xmath35 .",
    "this problem is not treated here although our methods might be useful also for such problems .",
    "the problem of majority percolation where a vertex becomes activated if at least half of its neighbors are active [ @xmath36 has been studied on the hypercube by balogh , bollobs and morris @xcite . on the @xmath37-dimensional grid @xmath38 but on the @xmath34 graph",
    ", this problem is completely different and still open .",
    "( we thank the referee for these suggestions . )",

    "the main results are stated in section  [ smain ] , with further results in sections [ sdyn ] and  [ sbound ] .",
    "proofs are given in sections  [ soverview][slast ] .",
    "all unspecified limits are as @xmath39 .",
    "we use @xmath40 for convergence in distribution and @xmath41 for convergence in probability of random variables ; we further use @xmath42 and @xmath43 in the standard sense ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) , and we use w.h.p .",
    "( with high probability ) for events with probability tending to 1 as @xmath39 . note that , for example , `` @xmath44 w.h.p . ''",

    "occasionally we use the subsubsequence principle ( @xcite , page 12 ) , which says that to prove a limit result ( e.g. , for real numbers , or for random variables in probability or in distribution ) , it is sufficient to show that every subsequence has a subsubsequence where the result holds .",
    "we may thus , without loss of generality , select convenient subsequences in a proof , for example , such that another given sequence either converges or tends to @xmath5 .",
    "[ ssetup ]    in order to analyze the bootstrap percolation process on @xmath0 , we change the time scale ; we forget the generations and consider at each time step the infections from one vertex only .",

    "mark _ ; we then say that @xmath60 is _ used _ , and let @xmath61 be the set of used vertices at time 1 .",
    "we continue recursively : at time @xmath62 , choose a vertex @xmath63 .",
    "we give each neighbor of @xmath64 a new mark .",
    "let @xmath65 be the set of inactive vertices with @xmath3 marks ; these now become active , and we let @xmath66 be the set of active vertices at time @xmath62 .",

    "the final active set is @xmath75 ; it is clear that this is the same set as the one produced by the bootstrap percolation process defined in the ; only the time development differs .",
    "hence we may as well study the version just described .",

    "thus @xmath64 will always be one of the oldest unused , active vertices , which will enable us to recover the generations ; see further section  [ sgen ] . in section  [ sdyn ] , we consider other ways of choosing @xmath76 . ]",

    "we analyze this process by the standard method of revealing the edges of the graph @xmath0 only on a need - to - know basis .",
