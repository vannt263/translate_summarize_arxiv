    "when stellar systems can be resolved into individual stars such as open and globular star clusters in the milky way and local group galaxies , one can derive their ages and metallicities via isochrone fitting to the main sequence turnoff and red giant branch in the color - magnitude diagram and fitting luminosity functions to the white dwarf cooling sequence ( hansen et al . 2002 ) .",
    "this luxury does not exist for more distant systems , however , so one must rely upon their integrated colors or spectra .",
    "calibrating theoretical spectrophotometric quantities using local , resolved systems is then surely a necessary step ( e.g. , gibson et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "since local and nearby extragalactic globular clusters ( gcs ) are easily detected and feasible for analysis due to their rather simple nature , there have been many photometric studies of globular cluster systems in external galaxies which have revealed important information regarding the link between gc systems and their host galaxies ( see ashman & zepf 1998 for a recent review ) .",
    "information regarding their relative ages within a given galaxy or between galaxies is particularly relevant for studying the hierarchical formation of galaxies . as globular",
    "cluster ages and metallicities become better constrained , the opportunities for understanding the process of galaxy formation and its subsequent evolution can only increase .    in recent years",
    ", there have been many efforts to develop evolutionary population synthesis models ( e.g. , bruzual & charlot 1993 ; worthey 1994 ; buzzoni 1995 ; vazdekis et al .",
    "1996 ; maraston 1998 ; lee 2001a , 2001b ) in order to analyze the integrated spectrophotometric quantities from globular clusters and galaxies and to derive their mean ages and metallicities .",
    "it is true that those integrated quantities are indeed determined by age and metallicity of those stellar systems , but it also should be kept in mind that they are the two most arguably dominant parameters that determine globular clusters horizontal - branch ( hb ) morphologies .",
    "therefore , the integrated colors of gcs should be affected to some degree by differing hb morphologies at the similar metallicity ( the ` second parameter ' effect ) .",
    "it is now generally accepted that age is the _ global _ second parameter that controls hb morphology [ after the first parameter , metallicity ",
    "lee , demarque , & zinn 1994 ; sarajedini , chaboyer , & demarque 1997 ; salaris & weiss 2002 ] , although for some gcs a third ( or more ) parameter may be needed to explain their peculiar hb morphologies [ such as blue tail phenomenon  recio - blanco et al .",
    "2002 ] .",
    "we are extending this second parameter analysis to broader age ranges in this work , applicable even to potentially older stellar systems than we have in the milky way , and investigate how variation of hb morphology influences the integrated photometric quantities . with a better understanding of post - main sequence stellar evolution , it is now feasible to study the systematic effects of those evolved stars on the integrated spectrophotometric values .",
    "one vivid example has already appeared in lee , yoon , & lee ( 2000 ; hereafter paper i ) for the realistic assessment of ages of old stellar systems using the h@xmath10 index .",
    "a unique aspect of these models lies in its treatment of the systematic variation of hb morphology as a function of age and metallicity . in this paper , we present a detailed quantitative analysis toward the effects of hb morphology on theoretical integrated broad - band colors ranging from far - uv to near - ir at various stages of age and metallicity .",
    "in addition , integrated broad - band colors that have been used to estimate the metallicity of globular clusters are examined with our models in order to check the veracity of the so - called color - metallicity transformation relations that are widely used , but based solely upon galactic gcs .    in section 2 ,",
    "our population models developed with and without consideration of hb stars are presented and compared with those of other groups .",
    "we first consider optical to near - ir colors , including those using the washington photometric system , an investigation of uv to optical colors is then presented .",
    "section 3 corroborates the validity of our models with hb stars by calibrating them using a sample of relatively low - reddened galactic gcs and our results are then used to assess several color - metallicity transformation relations .",
    "we compare our models with available uv to near - ir data for gc systems in m31 , m87 , and ngc 1399 ( e.g. , cohen , blakeslee , & ryzhov 1998 ; kissler - patig et al .",
    "1998 ; forbes et al . 2001 ) .",
    "in most cases , we have specially sought age - sensitive colors , to combine with spectroscopic metallicity information .",
    "a discussion of the implications of our work is provided in section 4 .",
    "the present models were constructed , in essence , from the same evolutionary population synthesis code , developed to study the stellar populations of globular clusters ( paper i ) . in summary , we have used the yale isochrones ( demarque et al .",
    "1996 ) rescaled for @xmath11-element enhancement / fe ] = 0.4 for [ fe / h ] @xmath9 @xmath11.3 , [ @xmath11/fe ] goes from 0.4 to 0.0 as [ fe / h ] goes from @xmath11.3 to 0.0 , and [ @xmath11/fe]=0.0 for [ fe / h ] @xmath12 0.0 ( wheeler , sneden , & truran 1989 ) . ] ( salaris , chieffi , & straniero 1993 ) and the hb evolutionary tracks by yi , demarque , & kim ( 1997 ) . for metal - rich ( [ fe / h ] @xmath12 @xmath10.5 ) populations , the value of the helium enrichment parameter , @xmath13_y_/@xmath13_z _ = 2 , was assumed . the standard salpeter ( 1955 )",
    "initial mass function was adopted for calculating the relative number of stars along the isochrones . for the conversion from theoretical quantities to observable quantities",
    ", we employed the stellar library of lejeune , cuisinier , & buser ( 1997 , 1998 ) in order to cover the largest possible range in stellar parameters such as metallicity , temperature , and gravity .",
    "as discussed in paper i , we have rescaled the isochrone ages , such that the 15 gyr isochrones now corresponds to present day 12 gyr old populations and @xmath13_t _ = 0 corresponds to t @xmath14 12 gyr .",
    "the treatment of the detailed systematic hb morphology variation with age and metallicity is also compatible with that of paper i. figure 1 presents our model isochrones as a function of hb morphology [ ( b@xmath1r)/(b+v+r ) , where b , v , and r are the numbers of blue hb stars , rr lyrae variables , and red hb stars , respectively ; lee et al .",

    "the updated hb types are adopted from the harris ( 1996 , june 1999 version ) compilation . in order to match the observed hb morphology of inner halo galactic gcs ( galactocentric radius @xmath15 8 kpc ) at their currently favored mean age ( @xmath3 12 gyr , @xmath13_t _",

    "it is useful to note here that the inner halo galactic gcs ( filled circles ) are not only systematically older , but also more tightly grouped along our model @xmath3 13 kpc , @xmath17 @xmath3 1 kpc ) and therefore it may not belong to the true inner halo cluster category ( see also section 4 .",

    "we have not taken into account the effects of extended blue tails on the hb , or blue stragglers , in this work , as it remains difficult to quantify them systematically with age and metallicity .",
    "we recognize though that some uv indices and colors may be affected by their inclusion . furthermore , except for the case of uv to optical colors , post - asymptotic giant branch ( pagb ) stars are not considered here .      here",
    "we address the theoretical integrated broad - band colors in the standard @xmath18 filter system .",
    "the following is a brief summary of the computational procedure .",
    "first , for each star ( or group of stars , after binning ) with a given metallicity , temperature , and gravity , we find the corresponding colors and the bolometric correction values from the color tables of lejeune et al . ( 1998 ) .",
    "second , these are converted into each bandpass luminosity .",
    "finally , after each bandpass luminosity has been summed , for a simple stellar population of a given metallicity and age , we compute the integrated photometric magnitudes for each bandpass .",
    "integrated broad - band colors are then calculated from these computed magnitudes .",
    "figure 2 presents our theoretical predictions for the integrated broad - band colors , ( a ) @xmath19 @xmath1 @xmath2 , ( b ) @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 , ( c ) @xmath2 @xmath1 @xmath4 , and ( d ) @xmath2 @xmath1 @xmath20 as a function of [ fe / h ] .",
    "we find that our models with hb stars ( thick lines ) show quantifiable differences from those without hb stars ( thin lines ) , notably in figure 2b .",

    "other colors appear to be affected to some degree by our treatment of hb morphology variations , but the effects are not as prominent in the age - range investigated here . in the succeeding investigation , we will mainly concentrate on @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 and @xmath2 @xmath1 @xmath4 because these two colors are two of the most frequently referred to in the literature .",
    "there have been related studies of the theoretical integrated broad - band colors in recent years ( e.g. , worthey 1994 ; kurth , fritze - von alvensleben , & fricke 1999 ; brocato et al .",
    "2000 ) , however , the different stellar physics and calibrations result in inevitable differences in their predictions .",
    "in particular , the different treatment of the hb is noteworthy and may result in significant differences in the models .",
    "for instance , worthey ( 1994 ; w94 ) treated hb stars as a rather simple red clump , providing results similar to those of our models without hb stars ( cf .",
    "http://astro.wsu.edu/worthey/ ) .",
    "both kurth et al .",
    "( 1999 ; kff99 ) and brocato et al .",
    "( 2000 ; bcpr00 ) include hb stars in their models but their values of @xmath16 , the efficiency of mass loss , are different ( @xmath16 = 0.35 in kff99 and @xmath16 = 0.4 in bcpr00 ) from ours ( @xmath16 = 0.65 ) probably because they adopted @xmath3 15 gyr for the absolute age of galactic gcs ( see table 1 of yi et al .",
    "1999 for the different choice of @xmath16 in connection with that of the absolute age of galactic gcs ) .",
    "for example , figure 3 shows significantly different hb morphologies at the same metallicity and similar age as different values of @xmath16 ( different amounts of mass loss ) are adopted . the padova isochrones ( girardi et al .",
    "2000 ) employ the smaller value of @xmath16 = 0.4 compared to that which we use in this study ( open circles and small points ) and seemingly no mass dispersion is taken into account ( triangles ) .",
    "combination of these issues results in different model predictions , particularly for temperature - sensitive indices .",
    "bcpr00 tested several values of @xmath16 and showed that higher values of @xmath16 gave bluer colors ( see their fig . 8) .    despite these differences ,",
    "it is interesting to note that both kff99 and bcpr00 do show slight crossovers among different ages at the low metallicity region in the @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 vs. [ fe / h ] plane ( see fig . 3 of kff99 and fig . 9 of bcpr00 )",
    "in addition , it is noted that almost all models reveal some non - linear feature in the @xmath2 @xmath1 @xmath4 vs. [ fe / h ] plane , being flatter in the low metallicity range , [ fe / h ] @xmath9 @xmath1 1.0 .",
    "the importance of this non - linearity will be addressed further in section 3.1 when the empirical _ linear _ color - metallicity relations are assessed with our models .",
    "the washington photometric system introduced by canterna ( 1976 ) was originally developed as an optimum system for deriving temperatures ( @xmath6 and @xmath21 filters ) and abundances ( @xmath5 and @xmath7 filters ) for late - type giant stars .",
    "in essence , the @xmath5 filter covers about two thirds of the @xmath19 and @xmath0 filter , and the @xmath7 filter has its peak between the @xmath0 and @xmath2 filters and covers about half of each filter .",
    "the @xmath6 and @xmath21 filters are almost identical to the @xmath22 and @xmath4 filters , respectively ( see , fig . 1 of lejeune & buser 1996 ) . because of its efficiency with the broader bandpasses than the commonly used @xmath23 , the popularity of this system has grown in recent years , when obtaining integrated colors of gc systems in distant galaxies ( e.g. , geisler & forte 1990 ; lee & geisler 1993 ; secker et al .",
    "1995 ; zepf et al . 1995 ; ostrov et al .",
    "perhaps the most important use of this system is in the determination of metallicities for distant gcs from their integrated colors , especially ( @xmath5 @xmath1 @xmath6 ) , with its very long color baseline ( geisler & forte 1990 ) .",
    "although the number of observational studies using the washington photometry has been increasing , little has yet been done in modeling the colors for the system , at least in comparison with the extant body of model colors for the @xmath23 system . in this context , we investigate the theoretical integrated colors using the washington photometric system .",
    "the computation of integrated colors using the washington system required some modifications to the procedure described in section 2.1 .",
    "first , we generate the integrated spectral energy distributions ( seds ) for a simple stellar population of a given metallicity and age using the flux tables ( lejeune et al .",
    ". then the fluxes within each bandpass of the washington photometric system are integrated using the relative filter response functions , and we calculate the integrated magnitudes and colors . we have taken the response functions of the washington system from kpno homepage ( http://www.noao.edu ) .",
    "figure 4 shows effects of hb stars on ( a ) @xmath7 @xmath1 @xmath6 and ( b ) @xmath5 @xmath1 @xmath6 colors , as predicted from our models , as a function of [ fe / h ] .",
    "thin lines represent models without hb stars , while thick lines include the effects of hb stars , based on the model loci of figure 1 .",
    "it is found that both @xmath7 @xmath1 @xmath6 and @xmath5 @xmath1 @xmath6 colors are affected by blue hb stars and become bluer by @xmath3 0.08 mag and by @xmath3 0.2 mag , respectively , than the models without hb stars , similar to the feature seen in figure 2b [ ( @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 ) ] and the h@xmath10 index seen in figure 6 of paper i. geisler , lee , & kim ( 1996 ) examined the age , hb morphology , and metallicity sensitivities of the integrated @xmath5 @xmath1 @xmath6 color , based on the work of cellone & forte ( 1996 ) and concluded it was an efficient metal abundance index , in contrast , we have found that the integrated @xmath5 @xmath1 @xmath6 is , to some degree , affected by the systematic variation of hb morphology with age and metallicity .",
    "it is difficult to compare our results directly with those of cellone & forte ( 1996 ; cf96 ) , because cf96 give their outputs only at two given ages ( 5 and 15 gyr ) and base their predictions upon the older buzzoni ( 1989 , 1995 ) population synthesis code .",
    "however , it is evident even in cf96 that the predicted @xmath5 @xmath1 @xmath6 with an intermediate hb morphology is bluer than that of a red hb , at the same metallicity ( see fig .",
    "7 of geisler et al .",
    "theoretical modeling of the washington photometric system based on a large sample of individual stars would undoubtedly give more credibility to this particular aspect of stellar population synthesis work ( e.g. , lejeune & buser 1996 ) .      the computational procedure for the relevant uv bandpass magnitudes",
    "is almost identical to that which we described in section 2.2 .",
    "for the case of uv to optical colors of an old stellar population , however , the contribution from pagb stars is considered .",
    "a small number of pagb stars can have a significant impact upon the integrated uv flux .",
    "the pagb contribution is somewhat stochastic by nature , due to small number statistics being driven primarily by their short lifetimes .",
    "for instance , the evolutionary lifetime of a 0.565 m@xmath24 pagb star is only 40,000 years ( schnberner 1983 ) compared to about 100 myrs for hb stars .",
    "we have quantified the expected number ratio of pagb to hb stars based on the ratio of their evolutionary lifetimes after more than 10 simulations and added the corresponding averaged fluxes using schnberner s ( 1983 ) evolutionary track for a 0.565 m@xmath24 pagb star .",
    "figure 5 shows several integrated seds from our models , with and without pagb stars .",
    "three ages ( @xmath13_t _ = + 4 , 0 , and @xmath1 4 gyr ) are illustrated at the given metallicity ( [ fe / h ] = @xmath1 1.17 ) .",
    "all fluxes have been normalized to unity at 5550  and then converted into magnitudes .",
    "one can then easily estimate magnitude differences relative to the @xmath2-band from figure 5 .",
    "for the ensuing investigation , 15 @xmath1 @xmath2 and 25 @xmath1 @xmath2 are defined as the magnitude differences between the far - uv and the near - uv band centered at 1550  and 2490  , respectively , with 150  bandwidths , as indicated by the grey columns in figure 5 , and the visual band .",
    "the dashed lines in figure 5 ( @xmath13_t _ = @xmath1 4 gyr ) show that old stellar systems with only red hb stars would have minimal far - uv flux without a pagb contribution . from the dotted lines in figure 5 ( @xmath13_t _ = + 4 gyr )",
    ", we can see that once hot blue hb stars begin to become important for very old systems , the pagb contribution becomes increasingly insignificant .",
    "consequently , it is seen that the older populations with the bluer hb stars should be relatively uv bright , especially in the far - uv range . in the near - uv range , however , it is seen that the contribution from pagb stars is relatively unimportant .    in figure 6",
    ", 15 @xmath1 @xmath2 and 25 @xmath1 @xmath2 colors from our models including contributions from pagb stars are plotted against [ fe / h ] for five relative ages ( @xmath13_t _ = @xmath1 4 , @xmath1 2 , 0 , + 2 , and + 4 gyr , respectively ) .",
    "the 15 @xmath1 @xmath2 vs. [ fe / h ] plot ( figure 6a ) is reminiscent of figure 1 , which suggests that the far - uv to optical colors also describe the hb morphology , in a manner similar to that of the optical to near - ir colors .",
    "this leads us to believe that far - uv photometry , in combination with optical data , will provide a useful age discriminant for gc systems . in figure 6b , however , it is found that 25 @xmath1 @xmath2 from our models is relatively insensitive to the variation of hb morphology , compared to 15 @xmath1 @xmath2 .",
    "this is because in the near - uv range the contribution from main sequence turnoff stars is not insignificant .",
    "these models will be tested using the available uv datasets of galactic and m31 gcs in section 3.3 .",
    "having discussed the theoretical aspects of generating integrated broad - band colors in section 2 , we now provide an empirical calibration for the models using the milky way s gc system .",
    "we adopt harris ( 1996 ) dataset for calibration purposes , but restrict ourselves to those clusters with line - of - sight reddenings @xmath8(@xmath0",
    "@xmath1 @xmath2 ) @xmath9 0.2 .",
    "the more highly - reddened clusters possess increasingly uncertain photometry . when needed , the extinction law of cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 ) is adopted .",
    "figure 7 contrasts this sample of galactic gcs ( where filled circles represent inner halo clusters , and open circles , outer halo clusters ) with our models in the ( a ) ( @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2)@xmath25 , ( b ) ( @xmath2 @xmath1 @xmath4)@xmath25 , ( c ) ( @xmath7 @xmath1 @xmath6)@xmath25 , and ( d ) ( @xmath5 @xmath1 @xmath6)@xmath25 vs. [ fe / h ] planes . the integrated @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 and @xmath2 @xmath1 @xmath4 colors of galactic gcs",
    "have essentially negligible uncertainties , due to the intrinsic brightness of the sample ; the largest uncertainties can be traced to the uncertainty in foreground reddening , which corresponds to @xmath9 0.02 mag for this sample .",
    "the limited sample of galactic gcs with washington photometry ( harris & canterna 1977 ) is shown along with our models in figure 7c and 7d . as a matter of fact , this is a first ever try to separate the milky way globulars into subpopulations and to address their relative age differences using broadband colors .",
    "it appears that our models reproduce the differences between inner and outer halo clusters noted in figure 1 , in the sense that the inner halo clusters are not only more tightly grouped along the isochrone than the outer halo counterparts , but also relatively older from the eye fit .    in figure 7 , we applied 0.03 mag , 0.01 mag , and 0.05 mag zero - point offsets to the models in @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 , @xmath7 @xmath1 @xmath6 , and @xmath5 @xmath1 @xmath6 , respectively , in order to minimize the residuals between the models and the data .",

    "strom et al . ( 1981 ) suggest that uncertainties in their color zero - points amount to 0.1 - 0.2 mag .",
    "we found that zero - point offsets of 0.08 mag in @xmath19 @xmath1 @xmath0 , 0.11 mag in @xmath19 @xmath1 @xmath22 , and 0.01 mag in @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath22 were necessary to match our models to their photographic photometry .",
    "the models are consistent with the data , particularly for the brighter clusters with smaller observational uncertainties .",
    "although difficult to extract robust age information from this sample , figure 10c nevertheless shows that higher quality data paricularly in the regime of [ fe / h ] @xmath9 @xmath1 1 may allow for a useful age discrimination in the future .",

    "it appears that this sample of m87 gcs also exhibits systematic zero - point offsets , as noted by couture et al .",
    "of the order of @xmath27 0.04 mag in color . with only 9 clusters in common between couture et al .",
    "( 1990 ) and cohen et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , it is difficult to obtain useful age information of this system mainly because of the residual observational uncertainties .",
    "additional high - quality photometric data ( at least @xmath0 , @xmath2 , and @xmath4 ) is urgently required , in order to examine any potential age differences between gc systems in m87 and the milky way .",
    "the washington ccd photometry for the m87 gcs is compared with our models in figure 12 .",
    "thirty - two clusters have both photometry ( lee & geisler 1993 ; lg93 ) and spectroscopy ( cohen et al .",
    "we have used only 25 of these here , excluding the c field ( photometric uncertainty ) and w field ( non - photometric night ) data of lg93 ; they are plotted in figure 12(a ) and 12(b ) .",
    "the typical photometric error in @xmath5 @xmath1 @xmath6 for the cluster sample is 0.06 mag , but far smaller for the brighter gcs .",
    "the typical uncertainty in spectroscopic metallicity is @xmath3 0.2 dex , and is not displayed here for clarity .",
    "the qsnr , defined by cohen et al .",
    "( 1998 ) in their spectroscopic analysis , correlates with photometric magnitude in the sense that brighter clusters are of higher qsnr .",
    "the large filled circles of figure 12 have qsnr @xmath12 50 , and are the relatively bright clusters with relatively high accuracy in photometry as well as in spectroscopy .",
    "it is seen from figure 12 that even though our models trace the data reasonably well , the low quality of the m87 gcs photometry prevents us from any precise age estimation .    in figure 13 , we present a comparison of the ngc 1399 gcs ( photometric data from kissler - patig et al .",
    "1997 , [ fe / h ] from kissler - patig et al .",
    "1998 ) with our models in the [ fe / h ] vs. ( @xmath2 @xmath1 @xmath4)@xmath25 plane .",
    "there appears to be a systematic offset between the data and our models .",
    "kissler - patig et al.s ( 1998 ) color - metallicity transformation relation ( figure 8b ) differs substantially from other comparable relations , therefore it would be worthwhile to get more number of fine photometry of metal - rich clusters to address this seeming discrepancy .",
    "we can conclude from section 3.2 that reliable age information for extragalactic gc systems is difficult to obtain with the currently available optical to near - ir data . as suggested in section 2.3 though , far - uv photometry would appear to be more useful as an age discriminant .",
    "here , we examine whether our theoretical uv to optical colors can be applied to the available uv photometry of globular clusters in the milky way and m31 .    in figure 14 , data for the galactic gcs from the _ orbiting astronomical observatory _",
    "( _ oao 2 _ , filled circles ) and the _ astronomical netherlands satellite _ ( _ ans _ , filled squares ) and those for the m31 gcs from the _ ultraviolet imaging telescope _ ( _ uit _ , open circles ) are plotted with our models .",

    "there are 7 far - uv and 13 near - uv data points from the _ oao 2 _ , and 17 far - uv and 22 near - uv data points from the _ ans _ ( dorman , oconnell , & rood 1995 ) .",
    "bohlin et al . ( 1993 ) report 43 near - uv and 4 far - uv detections of m31 gcs using the _",

    "( 2000 ) .",
    "the predicted ( 15 @xmath1 @xmath2)@xmath25 colors from our models as a function of [ fe / h ] are compared with galactic gcs in the left panel of figure 14 .",
    "the _ oao 2 _ photometry is shown in figure 14a , and figure 14b presents that from the _ ans_. the errors associated with the _ oao 2 _ data amount to @xmath3 0.5 mag , and are omitted in figure 14a . as we compare it to figure 1 ,",
    "it is noted that the observations fall within the suggested age range of our model predictions .",
    "moreover , the far - uv flux from the well - known second parameter pair , m3 and m13 ( depicted as crosses ) , is explicable with a relative age difference of @xmath3 1.5 gyr between the pair .",
    "this is consistent with the recent age estimation for these clusters based on their optical ccd photometry ( rey et al .",
    "we also note that 47 tuc ( figure 14a ) is well reproduced by our models , verifying our estimation of the pagb star contribution to the integrated far - uv flux .",
    "the use of far - uv to optical colors is , therefore , suggested as the most promising chronometer for gc systems , with the admitted caveat that there are a few peculiar gcs , such as ngc 6388 and ngc 6441 with unexpected extended blue hb stars ( rich et al .",
    "if there are significant age differences between milky way and giant elliptical gc systems , in the sense of the latter being 2 - 3 gyr older ( as suggested in paper i ) , then we predict that the majority of metal - rich clusters would be far - uv bright compared to galactic counterparts . in this respect ,",
    "the results from the recent hst far - uv photometry of gc systems in virgo ellipticals ( go 8643 & go 8725 ) are highly anticipated .    in the right panel of figure 14 ,",
    "the ( 25 @xmath1 @xmath2)@xmath25 colors of m31 gcs ( _ uit _ data , open circles ) are shown with our models as a function of [ fe / h ] .",
    "in addition , the relevant data for galactic gcs ( _ oao 2 _ ; figure 14c , _ ans _ ; figure 14d ) are overplotted for comparison .",
    "we have recalibrated the ( 25 @xmath1 @xmath2)@xmath25 colors of the m31 gcs by adopting @xmath2 and @xmath8(@xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 ) from barmby et al .",
    "our models represent the near - uv photometry of m31 gcs , as well as those in the milky way , with no significant differences seen between the two systems , especially when disregarding the highly - reddened clusters ( triangles ) .",
    "this again suggests that the m31 and milky way gc systems are fundamentally similar , in agreement with the analysis of optical to near - ir colors seen in section 3.2 , and consistent with the earlier conclusions of bohlin et al .",
    "( 1993 ) . as discussed in section 2.3 , it is somewhat difficult to discriminate age differences of gc systems using the near - uv photometry alone .",
    "far - uv photometry of the m31 gcs would be highly desirable to better quantify our findings . in this respect , a large uv photometry dataset for the m31 gc system from the upcoming _ galex _",
    "( http://www.srl.caltech.edu/galex/ ) mission will become an invaluable resource .",
    "the primary goal of our paper was to investigate the effects of horizontal - branch stars on the integrated broad - band colors of old , simple , stellar populations .",
    "to do so , we have employed a unique , self - consistent , treatment of hb morphology as a function of age and metallicity .",
    "we have found that some temperature - sensitive integrated broad - band colors are significantly affected by the presence of blue hb stars within our investigated age range of @xmath1 4 gyr @xmath15 @xmath13_t _ @xmath15 + 4 gyr ( i.e. , 8 gyr @xmath15 t @xmath15 16 gyr ) . the close agreement between our models and the relatively low - reddened inner halo galactic gcs in both the johnson - cousins and washington filter systems is encouraging . the use of far - uv to optical colors is suggested to be a powerful age - dating regime for old stellar systems , when coupled with realistic hb morphologies ( lee 2001a , 2001b ) .",
    "future observations of gc systems in external galaxies from large ground - based telescopes and space uv facilities will enable us to quantify any systematic age differences between the various systems .",
    "a more sophisticated understanding of the theory governing mass loss and helium enrichment will also contribute to a better understanding of stellar age determination using far - uv photometry ( oconnell 1999 ) .",
    "in the case of the m31 gc system , our work suggests that it is not fundamentally different from the galactic system , from the uv through to the near - ir .",
    "this is in contrast to several studies which have claimed that the metal - rich m31 gcs could be much younger than the metal - poor sample ( e.g. , burstein et al .",
    "1984 ; barmby & huchra 2000 ) .",
    "future far - uv datasets to be provided , for example , by the _ galex _",
    "mission should aid in resolving this controversy .",
    "further washington system photometry will also be valuable ( lee et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the study of extragalactic gc systems today is being driven primarily by an attempt at understanding the bimodal color distributions seen from many early - type galaxies ( e.g. , larsen et al .",
    "2001 ; kundu & whitmore 2001 ) as well as from some spirals ( forbes , brodie , & larsen 2001 ) . the origin of these blue and red subpopulations and the implication for the formation of their host galaxies remains unclear . if a relative age difference exists between the subpopulations , an important piece of the galaxy formation puzzle will have been found .",
    "identifying useful age discriminants remains an important component of cosmology and galaxy formation .",
    "the broad - band photometric predictions described here , in combination with the spectroscopic discriminants of paper i , should provide observers with the necessary tools to discriminate age differences amongst gc subpopulations .",
    "finally , we conclude that several of the canonical _ linear _ color - metallicity transformation relations should be used with caution if there are sizable age differences amongst globular clusters within and between galaxies .",
    "it remains to be seen if bimodal color distributions can be interpreted as simple metallicity or age differences , or whether a more complicated interplay between metallicity and age must be involved .",
