    "in real life there are many tasks , which depend on such topological characterization as either a possibility or impossibility to place the graph on the plane .",
    "so , let us begin with the brief review of the planar graph s properties , which were proved at various times by different authors .    the boundaries of the different finite faces in the planar topological graph @xmath0 form the base of the independent cycles @xcite .    for the planar map there exists the euler formula @xcite : @xmath1 , where : @xmath2",
    " is a number of the vertexes ; @xmath3  is a number of the edges ; @xmath4  is a number of the graph s faces .",
    "indeed , the number of the finite faces is equal to the cyclomatic number @xmath5 , so : @xmath6 . and , finally : @xmath1 .",
    "many corollaries come from the euler theorem , all of them were presented by frank harary @xcite .    if @xmath0 is a planar @xmath7 map , in which every face presents a @xmath2cycle , then : @xmath8 .",
    "if @xmath0 is a maximal planar @xmath7 graph , then its every face is a triangle and @xmath9 .",
    "if @xmath0 - is a planar graph , in which any face is 4 cycle , then @xmath10 , so , the number of the vertexes is even .    if @xmath0  is an arbitrary planar @xmath7 graph and @xmath11 , then : @xmath12 .",
    "if graph @xmath0 is doubly connected and does not contain the triangles , then : @xmath13 .    every planar graph @xmath0 with @xmath14 vertexes",
    "has at least @xmath15 vertexes , which degrees are not more then @xmath16 .",
    "the graph is the maximal planar graph if and only if it is a planar triangulation @xcite .",
    "the graph is planar if and only if every its block is planar .",
    "it is evident that any planar graph can be lied ( stacked ) down on the sphere .",
    "the opposite is also true .",
    "it may be done with the help of different methods @xcite .",
    "the necessary and sufficient conditions at which graph @xmath0 appears to be the planar graph consists in the fact that the graph can not contain the partial subgraphs ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) of type either @xmath17 or @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the proof can be found in the book of berge @xcite .",
    "it is said that the graph @xmath19 satisfies the condition of harary  tutte , if it is impossible to turn it s skeleton into either the graph @xmath20 , or into the graph @xmath21 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) @xcite .    for more understanding of the behaviour of the dual planar graphs it will be necessary to examine their basic properties and also their numeric properties in order to determine the interrelations between them for the comparable graphs .",
    "the main of the properties are : the number of the vertexes , the number of the edges , the chromatic number , the cyclomatic number and the chromatic class .    also it will be very interesting to examine the properties of the dual matrixes in order to determine their form and size .",
    "so , let us introduce the conjugated planar triangulation .",
    "let us examine the planar triangulation and present some new theorems , because the solution of the four color problem for the maximal graph @xmath22 means its solution for an arbitrary planar graph .",
    "it is well known that the planar triangulation possesses a number of important properties :    * the planar graph @xmath22 has @xmath23 finite faces and one infinite face . *",
    "it is impossible to add to graph @xmath22 such an edge , which will not traverse some other edge , or which will not coincide with one or another already existing edge , or which will not cut off one more finite face from the infinite face . *",
    "the addition of the planar graph @xmath24 to the planar triangulation @xmath22 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) by means of the new edge s insertion indicates the adding of the restrictions , which does not reduce the cyclomatic number of graph @xmath22 in comparison with the cyclomatic number of graph @xmath24 .    and",
    "starting from this moment we ll begin to examine the planar triangulation together with its dual graph  the conjugated planar triangulation .",
    "let us introduce the planar conjugated triangulation , which appears to be a graph dual to the planar triangulation .",

    "[ fig:2 ] ) appears to be the graph of the medians faces of the triangulation @xmath22 .",

    "two medians of the finite face are incident to the vertex @xmath31 ; in another case four medians are incident to the vertex @xmath31 .",
    "that is why the degrees of the graph s @xmath30 vertex @xmath31 can have only two values : either 2 , or 4 . the theorem is proved .",
    "the planar triangulation @xmath26 contains the euler circuit ( contour ) , which goes exactly twice times along all the inner vertexes @xmath33 .",
    "the proof evidently comes from the euler theorem @xcite : graph possesses the euler circuit if and only if it is connected and the number of the vertexes with the odd degrees is equal either to 0 or 2 .",
    "all the vertexes of the planar conjugated triangulation have the even degrees of the vertexes .",
    "in addition , all the inner vertexes have the degree , equal to four .",
    "the theorem is proved .",
    "let us denote such euler circuit as the bi  euler circuit .",
    "the edges @xmath34 of the planar conjugated triangulation may be orientated in the direction of passing the euler circuit .",
    "the finite graph s @xmath30 faces @xmath35 put together two and only two subsets of the elements ( or two classes of the equivalence ) :    1 .",
    "the first subset of the faces , notably @xmath36 , includes the faces , the boundary of which is made up from the medians of one face of graph @xmath32 .",
    "these faces are situated inside the faces @xmath37 .",
    "all these faces @xmath29 are the triangles .",
    "the second subset of the faces , notably @xmath38 includes the faces , inside which the vertexes @xmath39 of the initial graph are situated .",
    "all these faces have the polygon form with the number of the sides : @xmath11 .    by the construction inside each face @xmath28 from @xmath32 the face @xmath29 of graph @xmath26",
    "is formed .",
    "these faces are formed by the medians of the @xmath28 faces .",
    "if the vertex @xmath40 from @xmath32 has the degree @xmath41 , then in this vertex the vertexes of the @xmath41 faces of the @xmath32 are concentrated . inside each face",
    "@xmath28 of graph @xmath22 the face @xmath29 is situated .",
    "its one side is directed to the @xmath40 vertex ( the vertex of the initial graph @xmath22 ) .",
    "the sides , which are gathered out of the faces @xmath29 , generate the cycle , which form the boundary of the polygon face of graph @xmath26 , inside which one vertex of graph @xmath32 is situated .",
    "the number of the sides of the @xmath29 faces , which compose the self - contained cycle around the @xmath40 vertex is equal to the degree of the vertex , notably @xmath42 .",
    "so , these faces are @xmath43angle ; the number of the sides in each of them is equal to @xmath42 .",
    "on the other hand , the planar conjugated triangulation has both the inner vertexes and the external vertexes .",
    "the external vertexes are those ones , which enter the boundary of the infinite face .",
    "the closed circuit out of the finite faces medians can not be generated around such vertexes ( fig .",

    "but the closed circuit out of the medians is simply generated around each inner vertex .",
    "none of the inner vertexes of the triangulation @xmath22 can have the degree @xmath44 .",

    "the theorem is proved .",
    "two faces of the second subset @xmath38 can have one shared vertex , but they can have no shared edges ( fig . [ fig:3 ] ) .",
    "the validity of the theorem comes from the previous theorem .",
    "indeed , the boundary of any face @xmath52 of the second subset forms the sides of the faces @xmath53 of the first subset .",
    "so , by no means two faces @xmath52 and @xmath54 can have a shared edge .    in each external vertex @xmath55 of graph",
    "@xmath30 , which has the degree @xmath56 , accurately meet a vertex of some face @xmath29 of the first subset and some vertex of the infinite face . in every external vertex @xmath55 , which has the degree @xmath57 ,",
    "the vertexes of two faces of the first subset @xmath58 , of one face of the second subset @xmath59 and of the infinite face @xmath60 are converged .    in each inner vertex @xmath61 of graph",
    "@xmath30 exactly converge the vertexes of two faces of the @xmath58 set and , therefore , of two faces of the @xmath59 set .",

    "the validity of the theorem comes from the fact that the boundary of any face of the second subset @xmath62 is formed by the sides ( edges ) of the faces @xmath58 of the first subset .",
    "if some edge enters two faces , then two vertexes ( the ends of the edge ) enter the same faces .",
    "the theorem is proved .",

    "the boundary of any face @xmath63 of the second subset consists only of the sides of the faces @xmath64 of the first subset .",
    "two vertexes are corresponding ( or belong ) to each of these sides . besides two sides of the face @xmath63 , two sides of the face @xmath64",
    "enter every such vertex .",
    "so , all the vertexes , which enter the boundary of the face @xmath63 have the degree equal to @xmath15 ( fig . [ fig:3 ] ) .",
    "the theorem is proved .",
    "only the external vertexes of the planar conjugated triangulation have the degree equal to @xmath18 .    indeed , the degree @xmath18 can have only those vertexes of graph @xmath26 , which correspond to those edges of graph @xmath22 , which enter the boundary of the external face , i.e. the external vertexes .",
    "the external vertexes of the planar conjugated triangulation can have the degrees @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "all the inner vertexes of the planar conjugated triangulation always have the degree @xmath66 .    if graph @xmath26 has the cut nodes , then such vertexes always have the degree @xmath66 .",
    "according to the construction .",
    "also , it is seen by the construction , that graph @xmath26 always can be presented as the graph , which is constructed out of the triangle faces , connected with the help of the vertexes .    our final target is the proof of the possibility of the coloring of graph s @xmath26 vertexes with three colors .",
    "graph @xmath26 is the adjacency graph of the edges of the planar triangulation @xmath22 . and",
    "if it is proved that graph s @xmath26 vertexes by all means can be colored with three colors , then four color hypothesis will become the proved theorem .",
    "let us formulate this theorem .",
    "let @xmath26 be the planar conjugated triangulation .",
    "its chromatic class is : @xmath67 .",
    "it comes from the brook s theorem .",
    "then its chromatic number is : @xmath68 .    before beginning the proof of this theorem we ought to study many other properties of the planar triangulation . but",
    "first of all we will examine the properties of the special graphs .",

    "if @xmath70  is a number of the edges ( arcs ) , @xmath71  is a number of the vertexes of graph @xmath22 , then for pct ( graph @xmath26 ) the dependences will be : @xmath72 and @xmath73 .    according to the construction of graph @xmath26 : @xmath74 . the number of the finite faces in graph @xmath26 : @xmath75 , where @xmath76",

    "that is , the number of the triangle faces @xmath29 in graph @xmath26 is equal to the number of all the faces @xmath80 of graph @xmath22 ( according to the construction ) . under theorem 8 the number of all the polygon faces in graph @xmath26 , including the infinite face , is equal to the number of the faces in pt and makes up : @xmath81 . at",
    "that the number of the finite faces is equal to : @xmath82 . according to the construction of graph @xmath26 ,",
    "the number of the graph s edges is equal to : @xmath83 .",

    "remark 1 _ : some of these formulas can be found in the works of other authors , for example , harary .",
    "but , as you can see , they also may be obtained applying the dual graphs .",
    "a cyclomatic number is always equal to the maximal number of the independent cycles in the graph .",
    "each step , increasing the cyclomatic number , also increases the maximal number of the independent cycles . and",
    "this fact leads to the increasing of the graph s complexity .",
    "a cyclomatic number of the planar conjugated triangulation @xmath26 depends only on the number of the vertexes @xmath97 in graph @xmath26 and is equal to : @xmath98 .",

    "the theorem is proved .",
    "as far as the number of the edges @xmath100 in the planar conjugated triangulation @xmath26 is equal to : @xmath99 , then the dependence of the cyclomatic number on the number of the edges may be presented as : @xmath101 .",

    ".    _ remark 2 _ : the previous theorem and corollary are very important and specify the fact that the number of the logical equations , which connect the pairs of differently colored vertexes in graph @xmath22 between themselves , is equal to the number of the logical equations , which connect between themselves the differently colored vertexes in graph @xmath26 .",
    "_ remark 3 _ : in each case the number of the equations is a unit more than it is necessary to have in the system of the linearly independent equations .",

    "the algorithms of obtaining the exact solution are absent for such equations systems .",
    "maybe such circumstances will help us to understand the reasons for the absence of the local algorithms intended for the vertexes coloring in the planar triangulations in a general case .",
    "and maybe it will help us to understand actual reasons for the numerous attempts to solve the four color problem with the help of the mathematical statistics methods .",
    "let us examine the mutual relations between the cyclomatic numbers of different planar graphs , taking into account the planar graph , the planar triangulation ( pt ) and the planar conjugated triangulation ( pct ) .",
    "so , at last we have the planar homogeneous graph @xmath24 , the planar triangulation @xmath22 ( generated out of graph @xmath24 ) and the planar conjugated triangulation @xmath26 ( generated out of graph @xmath22 ) .",
    "let us prove some theorems .",

    "next : @xmath118    or : @xmath119 .    or : @xmath120 , where @xmath121 ( the increment of the cyclomatic number ) . from this fact",
    "it also comes that the increment of the cyclomatic number is always even .",
    "_ remark 5 _ : this result shows us that at the conversion of pt into pct the cyclomatic number increases , at that the increment of the cyclomatic number depends on the value of the initial cyclomatic number . as for the applications",
    ", we can say that the graph s complexity ( a number of the independent cycles ) at the process of the conversion into the conjugated graph increases .",
    "the more complicated the initial graph was , the bigger is the increments growth . at the first sight it seems that the application of the properties of the dual graphs @xcite to the examining of the properties of the planar triangulations may make the results worse .",
    "but step - by - step it will be shown that only the introduction of pct permits us to widen considerably our view on the properties of pt .",
    "it is known that the cyclomatic number is always integer . from the formula above ,",
    "notably , @xmath122 it comes that the cyclomatic number is multiple to 3 .",
    "this dependence is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] .",
    "the graphical representation , of course , is somehow a little bit relative because the cyclomatic number is always even .",
    "this fact is displayed with the help of the markers .",
    "but it ( fig . [ fig:6 ] ) again shows us that the cyclomatic number increases at the conversion from the pt to pct .",
    "but in spite of the fact that the complexity increases , our chance to find the solution is not equal to zero .",

    "so , the very important conclusion follows that not a single adjacency vertexes matrix @xmath192 , which has the number of the vertexes of the initial triangulation more than @xmath207 @xmath208 can be subjected to the operation of the reverse converting .",
    "we must draw special attention to this conclusion , because exactly this one will be needed at the examining the necessary and sufficient conditions of the right coloring of the graph into four colors .",

    "so , graph @xmath209 ( the straight conversion of graph @xmath26 ) always has hamilton cycle @xcite .",

    "it is possible only if graph @xmath0 exists as an inverse conversion of graph @xmath26 .    but graph @xmath0 can not exist as an inverse conversion at the number of the vertexes @xmath210 .",
    "so , it is impossible to prove the existence of hamilton cycle in graph @xmath26 , relying on the operation of the inverse conversion of graph @xmath26 .",
    "thus , it is impossible in the limits of the existing axiomatic system .",
    "meanwhile , it will be useful to recollect hedel s theorem on the incompleteness @xcite .",
    "it is proved there that any formal axiomatic system contains the unsolvable hypotheses or that in any sufficiently complicated non contradictory theory a statement exists , which can not be either proved or disproved by means of this theory .",
    "the meaning of hedel s theorem is also in the statement that any sufficiently strong formal non contradictory logic - mathematical system obligatory contains either the formula or the statement , which can not be either proved or disproved in this system , but which is true .",
    "but this fact may be shown only with the help of some other methods , which go beyond the scope of the existing system .",
    "hedel s theorem is applicable not only to the arithmetic , but also to every science , including philosophy .",
    "the global meaning of hedel s theorem is in the fact that every science has problems , which can not be solved beyond the scope of this science , but only in the scopes of a new more general extended theory .",
    "the methodological significance of hedel s theorem consists in the fact that any fundamental theory is either the contradictory one , or is insufficient for the solution of some problems , which are arising in it .",
    "the appearing of the solution of the four color problem with the help of the computer may serve one of the possible withdrawals for the four color problem .",
    "so , let us make first , sufficiently wary suggestion that the four color problem is the statement , which we perhaps will not be able to prove in theorems because of hedel .",
    "but , though the four color problem contains the affirmation on its improvability , however , it is true . on the one hand ,",
    "the computer proofs exist . on the other hand , over a period of one hundred and sixty years",
    "no contrary instances were found .",
    "let us suggest that the four color problem is the true proposition , in spite of all the attempts to prove it with the help of the existing axiomatic system . hence a quite acceptable conclusion follows : the existing axiomatic system is incomplete .",
    "it seems most probably that we must do the following : we ought to accept the four color problem as an axiom and thus enlarge the existing list of the today s axiomatic system .",
    "the system will appear to become a complete one .",
