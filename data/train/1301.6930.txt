    "golf and virgo / spm instruments have been used since 1996 to study the characteristics of low - degree , solar - acoustic modes @xcite and even to unveil the asymptotic properties of dipole gravity modes @xcite .",
    "thanks to their high - quality observations , we were able to measure all the p - mode properties with very high precision not previously attainable , including mode asymmetries @xcite . moreover , the temporal variations of the p - mode parameters during cycle 23 were studied @xcite .",
    "the unexpected long activity minimum between cycles 23 and 24 @xcite reminds us that the physical processes governing the magnetic activity in the sun are not yet well understood .",
    "we analyzed observations collected by the space - based golf @xcite and virgo @xcite instruments onboard soho .",
    "a total of 6000 days were analyzed covering nearly 16.5 years between 1996 and 2012 .",
    "these datasets were split into contiguous 365-day subseries , with a one - fourth overlap .",
    "the power spectrum of each subseries was fitted to extract the mode parameters using a standard likelihood maximization function ( power spectrum with a @xmath0 with 2 d.o.f .",
    "statistics ) .",
    "each mode component was parameterized using an asymmetric lorentzian profile @xcite .",
    "the temporal variations of the frequency shifts were defined as the difference between reference values ( taken as the average over 1996 - 1997 ) and the parameters of the corresponding modes observed at different dates .",
    "subseries with duty cycles less than 90% ( around the soho vacation ) were not taken into account for this analysis .",
    "the weighted averages over the central part of the 5-min oscillation power from 2200 to 3400 @xmath1hz of the temporal variations of the mode parameters were then calculated .",
    "mean values of daily measurements of the 10.7-cm radio flux were used as a proxy of the solar surface activity .",
    "linear regressions were performed between the temporal variations of the mode parameters and the radio flux using independent points only .",
    "in fig .  [ fig1 ] we show the average temporal variations of the l=0,1 , and 2 p - mode frequencies observed by golf and virgo following @xcite .",
    "the 11-year solar cycle is clearly visible superimposed to the the 2-year modulation originally described by @xcite , and fully discussed by @xcite .",
    "the frequency shifts are anticorrelated with the amplitude of the modes .",
    "no significant temporal variations have been found on the rotational splittings in agreement with @xcite .    left panel : temporal variations of low - degree modes as described in the text ; golf(black ) and virgo ( blue ) .",

    "the temporal variations of the mode amplitudes , @xmath2@xmath3@xmath4 , and linewidths , @xmath2@xmath5@xmath4 , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] computed using the three virgo / spm channels .",
    "note that due to absolute calibration problems and the changes of the observing wings @xcite , the golf amplitudes and linewidths are not exploitable for the moment for this analysis .",
    "a proper calibration is currently underway .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we show the variations of @xmath6 @xcite as it is usually done in asteroseismology to track down activity cycles @xcite computed following @xcite .",
    "the results are comparable to the average of the individual mode amplitudes as shown in fig.[fig2]a .",

    "in fig .  [ fig4 ] , the temporal variations of the peak asymmetry @xmath2@xmath7@xmath4 of the modes observed by golf and virgo / spm are shown . due to the change in the golf observing configuration between the blue and the red wings @xcite , the variations ( gradient ) with the cycle are different ( see fig.4b ) .",
    "by correcting the raw virgo / spm averaged data using the algorithms used to process _",
    "data @xcite , we are able to measure the time evolution of the rotation signature produced by the sunspots crossing the visible solar disk .",
    "the projection of the wavelet power spectrum @xcite in the range 6 to 60 days onto the time domain , provides us with a proxy of the 11-year magnetic activity cycle .",
    "this methodology could be use to track magnetic activity cycles in other stars .",
