    "a key prediction of the cold dark matter ( cdm ) model is that a network of low - density filaments connects dark matter halos .",

    "the most prominent of these diffuse filaments are expected to thread the most massive dark matter halos in the universe , where galaxy clusters will form .",
    "the existence of this filamentary structure is widely accepted , however there is limited direct observational evidence of these dark - matter dominated filaments .",
    "one of the best ways to probe the structure of dark matter is by weak gravitational lensing , where the distortion of background galaxies can be used to map out the foreground distribution of mass density .",

    "the weak lensing signal - to - noise of a single filament between a single pair of galaxy groups is expected to be much less than unity .",
    "the approach of this paper will be to stack many thousands of filaments between pairs of luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) .",
    "lrgs inhabit halos of masses of a few times @xmath7 and so can be used as a proxy for galaxy groups @xcite . when stacking filaments , the signal is best understood as the ensemble average of shear ( or projected surface mass density ) around halo pairs .",

    "[ sec : sdss ] below , the disadvantage is that the relatively large error in photometric redshifts ( @xmath8 or @xmath9 ) will scatter physically connected pairs of galaxies away , and scatter seemingly independent pairs together , and so complicates the interpretation of the results .",

    "the published version of the same paper @xcite instead compared the data with stacked filaments from n - body simulations , finding reasonable agreement .",

    "the lrg - pair stacking procedure is outlined in section [ sec : measure ] , and the results are presented in both shear and convergence maps .",

    "finally , we provide an empirical measurement of the stacked filament surface mass density and total mass . in section [ sec:3pcf ] , we describe a model for stacked filament in the context of the perturbation theory , starting from the three - point galaxy - galaxy - convergence correlation function .",
    "we compare this model with the data , and discuss possible improvements to the model .",
    "section [ sec : conc ] summarizes our results throughout this work we adopt a cosmology with the following parameters : @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "in order to study the weak lensing signal of filaments one requires two sets of data : a catalogue of galaxy groups and cluster lens pairs , and a catalogue of background source galaxies with accurate ellipticity measurements .",
    "the cfhtlens data were derived from the wide component of the canada - france - hawaii telescope legacy survey ( cfhtls ) , which was optimized for weak lensing measurements .",
    "observations were taken between march 2003 and november 2008 with the cfht megaprime instrument which has roughly a @xmath16 field of view .",
    "the cfhtls wide data includes photometry in five optical passbands ( @xmath17 ) and covers @xmath18 square degrees in four patches on the sky ( w1-w4 ) , 3 of which have substantial overlap with boss / sdss - iii as discussed below . the deepest band ( @xmath19 ) data yields 17 resolved galaxies per square arcminute @xcite .",
    "galaxy ellipticity measurements were obtained with the ` _ _ lensfit _ _ ' algorithm @xcite , modelled with bulge and disk components ultimately giving the two ellipticity parameters , @xmath20 and @xmath21 by bayesian marginalization over galaxy size , centroid and bulge fraction .",
    "a corresponding _ lensfit _ weight was assigned to each galaxy given the variance of the ellipticity likelihood surface defined in equation 8 of @xcite .",
    "after weighting , the effective source density is 11 galaxies per square arcminute @xcite .",
    "photometric redshifts ( photo-@xmath22s ) were estimated using the bayesian photometric redshift ( bpz ) code outlined in @xcite , making use of the five - band photometry available from cfhtls @xcite , yielding a mean photometric redshift of 0.75 , much deeper than the lens sample of @xmath23 .",
    "the photo-@xmath22s are limited to the range @xmath24 , with a scatter of @xmath25 and a catastrophic outlier rate of @xmath26 @xcite . for a detailed description of the methods used to estimate the photo-@xmath22s , see @xcite .      in n - body simulations ,",
    "filaments connect the high density nodes where galaxy groups and clusters will be forming.to identify pairs of galaxy groups and clusters that are connected by a filaments , one requires an accurate estimate of their location in redshift space .",
    "unfortunately , the uncertainty associated with photometric redshifts will scatter true physical pairs away from each other and scatter false projected pairs to the same redshift .",
    "for example , if there are two physically - associated galaxies are scattered by a photometric redshift of @xmath27 ( the typical photo-@xmath22 uncertainty in cfhtlens ) , the corresponding scatter in their line - of - sight separation would be @xmath9 .",
    "this is much larger than the physical line - of - sight separation of order @xmath28 . to mitigate this issue , physical pairs",
    "should be identified with spectroscopic redshifts , which have orders of magnitude better redshift accuracy ( @xmath29 or @xmath30 km / s ) .",
    "boss has obtained spectroscopic redshifts for a large sample of lrgs , an excellent proxy for the centres of galaxy groups and clusters . in this study",
    "both the boss cmass and lowz sample galaxies were selected using the color - magnitude cuts from @xcite .",
    "the majority of the overlap on the sky between the boss and cfhtlens surveys is in the w1 , w3 and w4 patches ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see ) , and giving @xmath31 lrgs in total .",
    "a catalogue of lrg pairs was constructed by selecting pairs that were separated in redshift by @xmath32 ( corresponding to @xmath33 mpc comoving if in the hubble flow ) , and separated in projection ( i.e.  on the sky ) by @xmath34 .",
    "this gave a sample of @xmath35 pairs of lrgs , with a mean physical separation of @xmath36 , a mean redshift @xmath37 , and a mean stellar mass of @xmath38 . according to @xcite ,",
    "these lrgs are expected to lie in halos of total mass @xmath39 , corresponding to galaxy groups .",
    "in  [ sec : lensing ] , we outline the technical details of stacking the shear signal from the lens - source system and describe our method for isolating the filament signal between the lrgs . in  [ sec : emp_results ] we present results for stacked lrg pairs .      unlike galaxy - galaxy lensing , where one is interested in the circularly averaged _ tangential _ shear around individual galaxy centers , measuring the shear signal around pairs of lrgs is more complicated .",
    "the main complication arises because signal is not spherically symmetric , producing a shear signal that is not purely tangential .",
    "when stacking the lens - pair - source system , it is necessary to keep track of both components of the source ellipticity , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "in addition , one must account for the random orientations of lrg pairs , and their variable separation length . in ",
    "[ sec : coords ] below we develop a standardized coordinate system that allows for the stacking of arbitrary orientations and length , and in  [ sec : stack ] the actual stacking procedure is outlined .",
    ", as measured in the tangent plane projection relative to the @xmath42-axis , see equation ( [ eqn : theta_pair ] ) .",
    "it is clear that the lrgs are distributed uniformly from @xmath43    in galaxy - galaxy lensing , one bins source galaxies in radial annuli around the lens centre . here",
    ", however , we wish to stack lrg pairs which have uniform random orientations relative to the background galaxies ( see figure [ fig : orient_dist ] ) , and varying physical separations . to account for this ,",
    "we define a standardized coordinate system , normalized by pair separation , @xmath44 , and rotated such that the lrg pair coordinates will translate to @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the source galaxies positions and ellipticities must also be translated into this coordinate system as follows .    1 .",
    "first the galaxy s position is translated such that the central right ascension and declination , @xmath47 , of the lrg pair is at the origin , then projected into the tangent plane of the central point , @xmath48 2 .",
    "next the coordinates are rotated such that the lrg pair lies along the @xmath49-axis .",
    "this is done using the rotation matrix , @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the angle between the individual lrgs about the central point in the tangent plane , @xmath52 the subscripts @xmath53 represent the  left \" and  right \" lrgs in the pair .",
    "finally the coordinates are rescaled by the separation between the two lrgs in the tangent plane , @xmath54 this is the angular separation that corresponds to a projected physical separation , @xmath44 .",
    "putting it all together , the final position of a galaxy in this coordinate system will be , @xmath55 \\nonumber \\\\          y_{\\mathrm{g } } & = & \\frac{1}{s}\\left [ -(\\alpha_{\\mathrm{c } } - \\alpha_{\\mathrm{g } } ) \\cos{\\delta_{\\mathrm{c}}}\\sin{\\theta } + ( \\delta_{\\mathrm{g } } - \\delta_{\\mathrm{c } } ) \\cos{\\theta }          \\right ]       \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the source galaxies in the new coordinate system , their ellipticities also need transformed .",
    "the 2 components of ellipticity only need to be rotated .",
    "the rotation matrix is nearly the same as ( [ eqn : rot_mat ] ) , however the property that ellipticity is invariant under @xmath56 rotation requires that the angle just be doubled , @xmath57      the signal from an individual filament is expected to be very weak because the filament density is much lower than that of a galaxy or cluster of galaxies , so it is necessary to stack lrg pairs , _",
    "i.e. _ to take an ensemble average . to stack the source ellipticities around a pair of lrgs ( from here on referred to as the ` lens ' ) , a two dimensional grid is prepared based on the @xmath58 coordinate system developed in ",
    "[ sec : coords ] . for each lens ,",
    "at all @xmath59 cells of the grid , the the shear components are computed by averaging the source galaxy ellipticities ( @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) according to their _ lensfit _ weights , @xmath60 , with an additional factor of @xmath61 as in @xcite .",
    "the additional factor of @xmath61 is used to down - weight sources that are near the lens in redshift , for which the signal is expected to be very weak .",
    "the critical surface density , @xmath62 , is given by @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the angular diameter distance to the lens , @xmath65 is the angular diameter distance to the source , and @xmath66 is the angular diameter distance between the lens and source .",
    "to summarise , the ellipticities are stacked to obtain estimates of the shear according to @xmath67 where the average is over all lenses , @xmath68 , and background sources , @xmath69 , that belong to cell @xmath59 after the coordinate transformation .",
    "an additive correction is applied to the @xmath70 component ( before rotating ) when computing the shears , according equation ( 19 ) of @xcite , that accounts for a bias in cfhtlens lensfit ellipticity measurement",
    ". additionally , @xcite found that a multiplicative correction for noise bias needs to be applied _",
    "after _ the ellipticities are stacked , calculated from @xmath71 w_{j }               \\sigma^{-2}_{\\mathrm{crit};\\ell , j}}{\\sum_{\\ell}\\sum_{j}w_{j}\\sigma^{-2}_{\\mathrm{crit};\\ell , j } } .\\ ] ] the resulting corrected shears are",
    "then @xmath72      one problem with examining shear maps directly is that they are difficult to interpret . unlike the case of galaxy - galaxy lensing , where one can interpret the stacked tangential shears in terms of the mean excess mass density , in the case studied here",
    ", there is no analogous interpretation of the individual shear components .",
    "one solution is to use the method of @xcite to convert the shear map into a convergence map , which is proportional to the surface mass density in the lens plane . from the definition of convergence ,",
    "we easily convert it to the surface mass density @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the ensemble average , calculated using @xmath75 the mean @xmath74 was found to be @xmath76 for our sample .",
    "the goal of this paper is to study the filaments that link groups and clusters .",
    "filaments themselves are difficult to define . for our purposes",
    ", we will define the filament as the excess mass present in a pair of lrgs , over and above that expected from the individual haloes of the lrgs themselves .",
    "therefore the contribution from the two lrgs must be removed .",
    "one requires a method that will remove any tangential shear produced by the lrg halos , leaving behind a signal only from the filament .",
    "@xcite introduced an elegant nulling method based on combining shear data at four different points , rotated with respect to the two lrgs in such a way as to null the spherically symmetric part of the signal .",
    "the disadvantage of their scheme is that the resulting signal combines signal from several locations and so it is difficult to visualize and understand . in this paper , we opt for a simpler approach : compare physical lrg pairs with `` non - physical '' ( projected ) lrg pairs .",
    "a particular pair of lrgs are likely to be physically connected if their line - of - sight separation is small . in this paper , we have adopted @xmath77 , corresponding to a line - of - sight separation @xmath78 mpc , to define physical pairs . by contrast , the same approach can be used to find lrg pairs that have such a large line - of - sight separation that the probability of being connected by a filament is negligible .",
    "such pairs only appear to be pairs in projection , and we shall refer to them as `` non - physical '' pairs .",
    "non - physical pairs of lrgs are selected to have a line - of - sight separation between 100@xmath2mpc and 120@xmath2mpc corresponding to a separation in redshift of @xmath79 . for determining background sources",
    ", we assume that the lens redshift is the average of the pair .",
    "when the ellipticities of sources that are behind the non - physical pairs are stacked , there should only be contributions from the two lrgs .",
    "therefore by subtracting the stacked map of the non - physical pairs from that of the physical pairs , the remaining signal should be due to the filament . with this method ,",
    "the data can be compared to the model in terms of shears or in terms of convergence ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "since it is easier to interpret the convergence signal , the remainder of the paper will focus on the @xmath80 maps .",
    "+    the shear map after stacking pairs of lrgs with projected separations between 6@xmath2mpc and 10@xmath2mpc ( average 8.23 @xmath2mpc ) is shown in figure [ fig : shear_map ] .",
    "figure [ fig : convergence ] shows the resulting convergence map , with the upper panel showing the convergence around physical pairs of lrgs .",
    "the striking feature in this panel is the clear structure connecting the two physical lrgs .",
    "the lower panel of figure [ fig : convergence ] shows the convergence map from the lensing signal for non - physical lrg pairs , in the same projected separation range ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "a key feature of the lower panel is the lack of `` bridge '' between the two lrgs that is seen in the upper panel .    to measure the residual filament signal , we begin by subtracting the convergence map of non - physical pairs ( lower panel of figure [ fig : convergence ] from the convergence map of physical pairs ( upper panel of figure [ fig : convergence ] ) .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ fig : conv_sub ] .",
    "the excess surface mass density is clearly visible around the filament midpoint @xmath82 .    to quantify the filament mass",
    ", we place a box of dimensions @xmath83 , representing the projected dimensions of the stacked filament ( see figure [ fig : conv_sub ] ) , and measure the average excess convergence contained inside the box . after performing the direct subtraction of physical and projected pairs",
    ", there may be a small over- or under - subtraction of the convergence in the regions closest to the lrg positions due to a small differences in the mean physical and non - physical pair lrg masses .",
    "moreover , the halos are likely to be elliptical and pointed along the line connecting the lrgs .",
    "therefore , we wish to exclude from our definition of the filament , regions where the elliptical component of the lrg halos dominates the convergence .",
    "we note that some studies suggest that the @xmath84 of a dark matter halo may not be the optimal definition of its boundary with accreting matter extending well beyond @xmath84 ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to avoid including these lrg halo regions in the filament mass estimate",
    ", we only consider the filament to include points farther than @xmath85 from either lrg .",
    "the final width @xmath86 corresponds to 7.1 @xmath2mpc .",
    "we estimate uncertainties via monte carlo simulations of the shape noise .",
    "specifically , we generate 1000 realizations by adding artificial scatter to the galaxy ellipticities consistent with shape noise .",
    "these noisy realizations are propagated to the @xmath80 maps generated by the @xcite method , and through the subtraction of non - physical pairs ( the map of which has independent noise ) .",
    "finally these uncertainties are propagated to the enclosed masses and mean @xmath80 measurements discussed below .",
    "figure [ fig : kappa_v_dy ] shows the resulting mean convergence within the box as the width of the box , @xmath87 , is increased .",
    "we then convert the convergence to a surface mass density using eq .",
    "( [ eqn : sigcrit_field ] ) .",
    "it is then straightforward to calculated the average mass contained within the filament box , shown in figure [ fig : av_mass ] . from figure",
    "[ fig : kappa_v_dy ] , we see that the signal - to - noise peaks around @xmath88 corresponding to a physical width of @xmath89 at a significance of @xmath90 .",
    "the corresponding mass contained within the filament is @xmath91 .",
    "the filament mass shows no sign of increasing beyond this @xmath87 so we adopt @xmath89 as the fiducial width .",
    "the filament region has a projected length of @xmath92 mpc on the sky .",
    "we estimate that this corresponds to a true length @xmath93 mpc when the line of sight depth is included .",
    "assuming that the filament is a uniform density cylinder of length 8 @xmath2mpc and diameter 2.5@xmath2mpc , the corresponding excess density within the cylinder is then @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the mean density within the cylinder and @xmath96 is the background matter density .",
    "the filament mass found here is a factor of a few less massive than the one reported by @xcite , and about one order of magnitude less massive than the one reported by @xcite .",
    "the difference in mass is likely due to the typical halo masses that connect the filament .",
    "the average host halo mass here is the order of @xmath97 , corresponding to a rich group rather than a massive cluster .",
    "in contrast , the host halos considered in @xcite and @xcite have masses of a few @xmath98 up to @xmath99 for @xcite , corresponding to rich clusters of galaxies .",
    "the study of @xcite is similar to this work in the sense that it studies stacked filaments between lrgs .",
    "their sample of lrgs was selected from sdss - ii , similar to the lrgs used in this study .",
    "their paper does not provide a filament mass , perhaps because of the way in which the nulled filament is measured in their work makes it difficult to constrain directly .",
    "they do analyze a set of stacked n - body filaments , which provide a reasonable fit to their signal .",
    "examination of the convergence map of these filaments in their figure 5 , and allowing for the difference in @xmath100 suggests that the signals are comparable in mass .",
    "figure [ fig : conv_sub ] shows the stacked excess surface mass density around many pairs of lrgs .",
    "it therefore does not correspond to an individual filament but an ensemble average of stacked filaments . to model it",
    ", we therefore consider the galaxy - galaxy - convergence ( gg@xmath80 ) 3-point correlation function ( 3pcf ) derived from perturbation theory and developed in @xcite . here",

    "also shown is the total averaged convergence within the filament box . at a glance , it appears the three - point function fits the data well , however the model lies slightly above the best fitting value . while the model appears to be a good fit to the central filament region ( @xmath114 ) , the data do not appear to show the excess around the two lrgs ( @xmath115 ) that is both predicted by the 3pcf and seen in simulations @xcite . neglecting this and simply performing a least squares fit to the entire @xmath49 range",
    "suggests that the model overestimates the data by a factor of @xmath116 .",
    "the required re - scaling of the 3pcf model is relatively small , being on the order of uncertainty in the data ( roughly @xmath117% ) .",
