    "in the fundamentals of radiation transfer in the static atmosphere , in order to solve moment equations truncated at the finite order , we need some relation to close the sequence ( chandrasekhar 1960 ; mihalas 1970 ; rybicki , lightman 1979 ; mihalas , mihalas 1984 , shu 1991 ) .",
    "when moment equations are truncated at the second order , we usually adopt the _ eddington approximation _ in the inertial frame ( laboratory frame ) as a closure relation , @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the radiation energy density and the radiation stress in the inertial frame , respectively . in a relativistic radiative flow , where the gas moves at a relativistic speed",
    ", we also assume the eddington approximation in the comoving frame ( fluid frame ) , @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the radiation energy density and the radiation stress in the comoving frame , respectively .",
    "then , this closure relation in the comoving frame is transformed to the relation in the inertial frame ( lindquist 1966 ; hsieh , spiegel 1976 ; fukue et al .",
    "1985 ; kato et al . 1998 ) .",
    "these relations are valid in the diffusion limit , where the photon mean - free path is sufficiently smaller than the scalelength of the system in the optically thick regime . in other words , in such a diffusion limit , the radiative diffusion is supposed to be _ isotropic _ , and the so - called _ eddington factor _",
    "@xmath12 is set to be @xmath13    however , in the optically thin regime , where the photon mean - free path is sufficiently larger than the scalelength of the system , the radiative diffusion generally becomes _",
    "anisotropic_. for example , in the spherically symmetric case , the eddington factor should be unity in the streaming limit ( it should be noted that in the plane - parallel case the eddington factor is always 1/3 ) .",
    "hence , in order to bridge the optically thick to thin regimes , a variable eddington factor , which depends on the optical depth @xmath4 , is usually adopted , @xmath14 in the spherically symmetric case ( tamazawa et al .",
    "1975 ) .",
    "recently , relativistic radiative flows were rigorously solved under a simple situation by fukue ( 2005b ) .",
    "he examined a flow radiatively - driven perpendicular to a luminous disk under a fully special relativistic treatment , taking into account radiation transfer .",
    "he adopted the current formalism as well as the eddington approximation in the comoving frame ( e.g. , kato et al . 1998 ) .",
    "when he arranged the basic equations of relativistic radiation hydrodynamics for the one - dimensional flow without gravity or other forces , he found the _ singularity _ in the sense of `` sonic '' points , where the flow speed is equal to the relativistic sound speed of @xmath15 .",
    "this singularity originates from the closure relation ( [ p0e0 ] ) for the radiation fields , and the appearance of the singularity suggest that the eddington approximation would be invalid in the relativistic flow with strong velocity gradients ( cf .",
    "turolla , nobili 1988 ; dullemond 1999 ) .    in analogy to the optically thick - thin transition",
    ", the possible invalidity of the eddington approximation in such a relativistic flow can be understood as follows . when the radiative flow is accelerated up to the relativistic regime and the flow velocity becomes of the order of the speed of light , the velocity gradient also becomes very large in the direction of flow . as a result , even in the comoving frame of the gas , the velocity fields as well as density distributions are no longer uniform , and the photon mean - free path would be longer in the downstream direction than in the upstream or other directions .",
    "hence , the radiative diffusion becomes _ anisotropic _ , and we should consider a variable eddington factor : the eddington factor may depend on the _ flow velocity _ @xmath0 ( @xmath16 ) in the form such as @xmath17    in several literatures ( e.g. , mihalas , mihalas 1984 ; mihalas 1986 ; kato et al .",
    "1998 ) , the influence of the flow velocity on radiation transfer was discussed in the context of the description between the comoving and inertial frames .",
    "that is , at the lowest order of the flow velocity to the speed of light , the closure relation in the inertial frame must be modified to the order of @xmath18 . in the comoving frame , however , the eddington approximation ( [ p0e0 ] ) was adopted , and no one considered the possible violation of the eddington approximation in the comoving frame .    in this paper",
    ", we thus propose a _ velocity - dependent variable eddington factor _ for the relativistic radiative flow , whose velocity becomes of the order of the speed of light .    in the next section",
    "we describe the basic equations for the one - dimensional vertical radiative flow , in order to show the typical problem which needs the velocity - dependent eddington factor . in section 3",
    ", we examine several properties required for the velocity - dependent eddington factor . in section 4",
    ", we solve a relativistic radiative flow under the appropriate boundary conditions at the flow base and top , and display the effect of the velocity - dependent eddington factor .",
    "the final section is devoted to the discussion on the physical reason of the present problem , the generalization of the variable eddington factor , and concluding remarks .",
    "in order to demonstrate the present problem inherent in the relativistic radiation transfer flow , we examine a simple one - dimensional flow in what follows .",
    "we consider the plane - parallel case in the vertical direction ; a luminous flat disk or thin skin above a luminous sphere .",
    "the radiative energy is transported in the vertical direction , and the gas itself also moves in the vertical direction by the action of radiation pressure . for simplicity , in the present paper ,",
    "the radiation field is sufficiently intense that both the gravitational field , e.g. , of the central object , and the gas pressure are ignored .",
    "the internal heating is also ignored . as for the order of the flow velocity @xmath0",
    ", we consider the fully relativistic regime , where the terms are retained up to the second order of @xmath19 . under these assumptions ,",
    "the radiation hydrodynamic equations for steady vertical ( @xmath20 ) flows are described as follows ( kato et al .",

    "the first term in the square bracket on the right - hand side of equation ( [ u1 ] ) means the radiatively - driven force , which is modified to the order of @xmath34 , whereas the second term is the radiation drag force , which is also modified , but roughly proportional to the velocity .    in the no - gas pressure approximation and without heating ,",
    "the energy equation is reduced to a radiative equilibrium relation , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the emissivity defined in the comoving frame . in this equation ( [ j1 ] ) , the third and fourth terms on the right - hand side appear in the relativistic regime .    for radiation fields , the zeroth - moment equation becomes @xmath37 .",

    "we then solve equations ( [ u ] ) [ or ( [ beta ] ) ] , ( [ k ] ) , and ( [ l ] ) for appropriate boundary conditions at the moving surface , as discussed in fukue ( 2005b ) , and for a suitable form of the variable eddington factor @xmath42 .",
    "we here briefly discuss the constraints on the velocity - dependent variable eddington factor @xmath42 and choose a preferable candidate for @xmath42 .    at first",
    ", this function must be reduced to 1/3 in the non - relativistic limit of @xmath53 . in the extremely relativistic limit of @xmath54 with strong velocity gradients , where the photon mean - free path becomes large",
    ", this function would approach unity , as in the case of the streaming limit for an optically thin regime . hence",
    ", the function @xmath42 must satisfy the boundary conditions , @xmath55 and should monotonically increase from 0 to 1 .",
    "another constraint comes from the critical conditions .",
    "as can be seen in equations ( [ u ] ) and ( [ beta ] ) , these equations have _ singularities _ ( critical points ) . that is , when the condition , @xmath56 is satified at some @xmath57 , the denominator of equation ( [ beta ] ) vanishes , and the equation becomes singular .",
    "for example , if the eddington factor is fixed as @xmath58 , the equation becomes singular at @xmath59 , or at the point , where the flow velocity is equal to the relativistic sound speed of @xmath15 .",
    "as already pointed out in dullemond ( 1999 ) , this singularity originates from the finite number of moments and the closure relation adopted ( see also fukue 2005b ) . in order for the relativistic transfer flow to be always regular , the condition",
    ", @xmath60 should be satisfied for @xmath61 .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath62 at @xmath54 , the equation is marginally critical ( @xmath63 ) at @xmath54 .    in addition , from the linear analysis around a critical point of equation ( [ u ] ) , the velocity gradient near to the singularity is found to be @xmath64 where the subscript c denotes the values at the critical point .",
    "if the eddington factor is fixed as @xmath58 , the velocity gradient becomes @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) . or",
    ", the transonic solution for the outflow ( @xmath67 ) must be decelerated at the critical point , as was discussed in fukue ( 2005b ) , where the subsonic solutions were obtained .",
    "hence , in order for the flow to be accelerated , even if the solution is marginally critical ( @xmath63 ) at @xmath54 , the velocity gradient @xmath68 should be negative ( or zero ) there for the outflow ( @xmath67 ) solutions .",
    "since the numerator on the right - hand side of equation ( [ dudtau ] ) is always positive , the velocity gradient is negative if the denominator of equation ( [ dudtau ] ) is negative : @xmath69 \\right|_{\\rm c }     = \\left .",
    "\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u }     \\left [ ( 1-f)\\gamma^2 \\right ] \\right|_{\\rm c } < 0,\\ ] ] or equivalently , @xmath70    now , bearing these constraints in mind , we examine several possible candidates of velocity - dependent eddington factors .",
    "one simple case is a form of @xmath71 where @xmath72 is constant . in this case , the eddington factor is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath57 , which satifies the boundary conditions at @xmath53 and 1 .",
    "however , since @xmath73 becomes negative at some @xmath57 for large values of @xmath72 ( @xmath74 ) , the values of @xmath72 should be restricted as @xmath75 .",
    "moreover , for this form , the equation is marginally critical at @xmath54 , and the velocity gradient at the critical point is negative , zero , and positive for @xmath76 , 2 , 3 , respectively .",
    "hence , the case of @xmath77 is rejected , and the cases of @xmath76 and 2 are retained ; the simplest case is @xmath76 .",
    "alternative is a form of @xmath78 where @xmath72 is constant . in this case , @xmath12 is also monotonically increasing , but @xmath73 becomes negative for large @xmath72 ( @xmath79 ) , and the values of @xmath72 may be around unity .",
    "moreover , for this form , the equation is marginally critical at @xmath54 , and the velocity gradient at the critical point is positive , and this form may be inadequate .    in analogy to a variable eddington factor for the optically thick - thin transition",
    ", we can consider a form of @xmath80 in this case , @xmath12 is monotonically increasing , but @xmath73 becomes negative at large @xmath23 .",
    "similar forms such as @xmath81 or @xmath82/[1 + 3/(\\gamma-1)^n]$ ] would be also inadequate , although we have not checked all possible cases one by one .",
    "consequently , we adopt the simplest case of @xmath83 in this paper .",
    "in this section we show several examples of solutions of equations ( [ beta ] ) , ( [ k ] ) , and ( [ l ] ) with velocity - dependent eddington factors under appropriate boundary conditions at the moving surface .",
    "as already pointed out in fukue ( 2005b ) , the usual boundary conditions for the static atmosphere can not be used for the present radiative flow , which moves with velocity at the order of the speed of light .    when there is no motion in the gas ( `` static photosphere '' ) , the radiation field just above the surface under the plane - parallel approximation is easily obtained .",
    "namely , just above the disk with surface intensity @xmath84 , the radiation energy density @xmath85 , the radiative flux @xmath86 , and the radiation pressure @xmath87 are @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 , respectively , where the subscript s denotes the values at the disk surface .",
    "however , the radiation field just above the surface changes when the gas itself does move upward ( `` moving photosphere '' ) , since the direciton and intensity of radiation change due to relativistic aberration and doppler effect ( cf .",
    "kato et al . 1998 ; fukue 2000 ) .",
    "let us suppose a situation that a flat infinite photosphere with surface intensity @xmath84 in the comoving frame is not static , but moving upward with a speed @xmath91 ( @xmath92 , and the corresponding lorentz factor is @xmath93 ) , where the subscript s denotes the values at the surface .",
    "then , just above the surface , the radiation energy density @xmath85 , the radiative flux @xmath86 , and the radiation pressure @xmath87 measured in the inertial frame become , respectively , @xmath94 where @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) is the flow four velocity at the surface ( fukue 2005b ) .",
    "thus , we impose the following boundary conditions : at the flow base ( deep `` inside '' the atmosphere ) with an arbitrary optical depth @xmath97 , the flow velocity @xmath23 is zero , the radiative flux is @xmath98 ( which is a measure of the strength of radiation field ) , and the radiation pressure is @xmath40 ( which connects with the radiation pressure gradient and relates to the internal structure ) , where the subscript 0 denotes the values at the flow base . at the flow top ( `` surface '' of the atmosphere ) where the optical depth is zero , the radiation field should satisfy the values above a moving photosphere given by equations ( [ es2])([ps2 ] ) .    applying boundary conditions ( [ es2])([ps2 ] ) to equations ( [ k ] ) and ( [ l ] )",
    ", we have two relations on the boundary values and mass - loss rate : @xmath99    physically speaking , in the radiative flow starting from the flow base with an arbitrary optical depth @xmath97 , for initial values of @xmath98 and @xmath40 at the flow base , the final values of the radiation fields @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and the flow velocity @xmath91 at the flow top can be obtained by solving basic equations .",
    "furthermore , the mass - loss rate @xmath24 is determined as an eigenvalue so as to satisfy the bondary condition at the flow top ( cf .",
    "fukue 2005a in the subrelativistic regime ) .    in the present , fully relativistic case , however , the final values of the radiation fields at the flow top depend on the flow velocity there , and the final values at the flow top can not be analytically expressed by the initial values at the flow base .",
    "hence , in this paper we determine the mass - loss rate as follows .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)figure01a.eps    ( 80mm,80mm)figure01b.eps    in the radiative flow with optical depth @xmath97 , we first give the final flow velocity @xmath91 ( and @xmath93 ) , instead of the initial value of @xmath40 .",
    "then , the final values of radiation fields @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 can be fixed by equations ( [ es2])([ps2 ] ) .",
    "next , we give a trial value for the mass - loss rate @xmath24 , and the initial values of @xmath40 and @xmath98 can be fixed by equations ( [ bc1 ] ) and ( [ bc2 ] ) . since all the parameters are temporarily fixed , we solve equation ( [ beta ] ) from @xmath100 to @xmath101 .",
    "generally , however , the obtained final velocity at @xmath101 is different from a given @xmath91 .",
    "thus , we vary the value of @xmath24 and follow iterative processes , so that the calculated final velocity coincides with a given final velocity @xmath91 .    finally , we adopt the velocity - dependent eddington factor of the form ( [ eddington ] ) .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)figure02.eps    examples of the relativistic radiative flows under the present velocity - dependent eddington factor are shown in figures 1 and 2 .    in figure 1",
    "we show the flow three velocity @xmath0 ( solid curves ) , the radiative flux @xmath32 ( dashed curves ) , and the radiation pressure @xmath33 ( doted curves ) , as a function of the optical depth @xmath4 for several values of @xmath91 at the flow top and for @xmath102 and 10 . the quantities are normalized in units of @xmath25 and @xmath89 .",
    "in contrast to fukue ( 2005b ) , where the acceleration solution beyond @xmath15 was not obtained by the presence of the singularity , originating from the usual fixed eddington factor , the present flow velocity can easily exceed @xmath15 to be accelerated toward the highly relativistic regime , since the singularity is evaded by the adoption of the velocity - dependent eddington factor ( [ eddington ] ) .",
    "other properties of the flow are similar to the previous case .",
    "for example , when the initial radiative flux @xmath98 at the flow base is large , the flow is effectively accelerated , and the final speed of the flow becomes large .",
    "the mass - loss rate @xmath24 is not given arbitrarily , but is determined as an eigenvalue ( fukue 2005a , b ) .",
    "in figure 2 we show the final velocity @xmath91 at the flow top ( solid curves ) and the mass - loss rate @xmath24 ( chain - dotted ones ) , as a function of @xmath40 for several values of @xmath97 at the flow base .",
    "the quantities are normalized in units of @xmath25 and @xmath89 .",
    "for example , the unit of @xmath24 is @xmath103 .    as can be seen in figure 1 , as the radiative flux increases , the final flow velocity at the flow top increases .",
    "moreover , as can be seen in figure 2 , and similar to the previous case ( fukue 2005a , b ) , in order for the flow to exist , the radiation pressure @xmath40 at the flow base is restricted in some range . in the subrelativistic case without gravity and heating ( fukue 2005a ) , the initial pressure @xmath40",
    "is proved to be restricted in the range of @xmath104 . in the present case ,",
    "the initial pressure is also restricted in some range , but is modified due to the relativistic effect and the velocity - dependent eddington factor .",
    "in addition , the loaded mass increases as the initial optical depth increases , even if the final flow speeds are the same .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)figure03.eps    for comparison , we show in figure 3 the results for several other forms of velocity - dependent eddington factors . in figure 3 , the parameters are fixed as @xmath102 and @xmath105 .",
    "a solid curve is for the case of @xmath106 , whereas a dashed one is for the case of @xmath107 , and a dotted one is for the case of @xmath108 .",
    "the boundary conditions at the flow top are the same in each case , but the radiation fields ( @xmath98 and @xmath40 ) at the flow base and the loaded mass @xmath24 are different in each case .",
    "in particular , the loaded mass in the case of @xmath106 is larger than those in other cases examined , and this is another reason to prefer the present form .",
    "it should be finally noted that , thanks to the velocity - dependent eddington factor , the relativistic radiative flow can be accelerated to reach an extremely relativistic regime , and the barrier of the magic speed above the static atmosphere ( icke 1989 ) would be now completely cleared away .",
    "moment equations for relativistic radiation transfer have been derived in several literature ( lindquist 1966 ; anderson , spiegel 1972 ; hsieh , spiegel 1976 ; thorne 1981 ; udey , israel 1982 ; schweizer 1982 ) .",
    "a complete set of moment equations for relativistic flow is given by the projected , symmetric , trace - free formalism by thorne ( 1981 ) .",
    "since a moment expansion gives an infinite set of equations , one must truncate the expansion at the finite order by adopting a suitable closure assumption , in order to make the transfer problem tractable .",
    "when one truncate at the second order , for example , the eddington approximation is usually adopted as a closure relation .    such radiation moment formalism is quite convenient , and it is a powerful tool for tackling problems of relativistic radiation hydrodynamics .",
    "however , its validity is never known unless fully angle - dependent radiation transfer equation is solved .",
    "actually , the pathological behavior in relativistic radiation moment equations has been pointed out ( turolla , nobili 1988 ; dullemond 1999 ) .",
    "namely , moment equations for relativistic radiation transfer can have singular ( critical ) points .",
    "for example , in the one - dimensional relativistic radiation flow using the eddington approximation ( [ p0e0 ] ) , where the moment equations are truncated at the second order , the singularity appears when the flow velocity becomes @xmath109 ( e.g. , fukue 2005b ) . as a result",
    ", solutions behave pathologically in regions of strong velocity gradients .",
    "the appearance of singularities is explained because we approximate the full transfer equations with a finite number of moments ( dullemond 1999 ) .    in order to avoid the singularity , in this paper , we thus propose and examine a _ velocity - dependent variable eddington factor _ in radiation transfer in relativistic radiative flows , which are accelerated up to a relativistic speed with strong velocity gradients .    as already stated in section 1 ,",
    "the physical reason is clear . in an optically thick , low velocity regime ,",
    "the mean free path of photons are the same in all directions , and the radiative diffusion is isotropic . in a relativistically accelerated flow",
    ", however , the velocity gradient of the flow becomes very large , and the density distribution also becomes non - uniform even in the comoving frame of the gas .",
    "hence , the mean free path becomes longer in the downstream direction than in the upstream and other directions , even in an optically thick regime , and the radiative diffusion becomes anisotropic .",
    "thus , in the case of subrelativistic to relativistic regimes , as in the case of optically thick to thin regimes , we should consider a variable eddington factor which depends on the flow velocity @xmath0 .",
    "the most preferable one , we propose , is @xmath110 where @xmath3 .    by adopting the velocity - dependent eddington factor ,",
    "the singularity found under the traditional formalism is removed , and the relativistic radiative flow can be solved from a low velocity regime to an extremely relativistic regime .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the present approach is relevant only for moment expansion up to the second order . if we attempt to solve the moment equation up to higher order , we may search alternative ways .",
    "we also propose a general form of a variable eddington factor @xmath113 , which would be useful for an arbitrary optical depth @xmath4 , and for an arbitrary velocity @xmath0 ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the conditions for such a generalized eddington factor are : ( i ) in the low velocity limit ( @xmath114 ) , it has the similar form as equation ( [ ftau ] ) , ( ii ) in the optically thick limit ( @xmath115 ) , it becomes the presently proposed form , ( iii ) in the optically thick , low velocity limit , it is 1/3 , and ( iv ) in the optically thin limit ( @xmath116 ) and/or in the relativistic limit ( @xmath117 ) , it approaches unity . for a spherically symmetric case , in order to satisfy these conditions , we apply the relativistic summation rule for the flow speed @xmath0 and the photon diffusion speed @xmath118 , and obtain a generalized eddington factor as @xmath119 it should be noted that , in the low velocity limit ( @xmath114 ) , this hybrid form ( [ ftaubeta ] ) becomes @xmath120 , which is somewhat different with equation ( [ ftau ] ) , but essentially the same . in the optically thick limit ( @xmath115 ) , this equation ( [ ftaubeta ] ) is reduced to equation ( [ eddington ] ) . for a plane - parallel case , on the other hand , equation ( [ fbeta41 ] ) can be used for an arbitrary optical depth .",
    "the velocity - dependent variable eddington factor for relativistic radiative flows proposed in the present paper is fundamentally important in various aspects of relativistic astrophysics with radiation transfer .",
    "for example , the present form may be applied to the cases of black - hole accretion flows with supercritical accretion rates , relativistic jets and winds driven by luminous central objects , relativistic explosions including gamma - ray bursts , neutrino transfers in supernova explosions , and various events occured in the proto universe .",
    "of course , the present proposition is only the first one , and not the final one .",
    "there exist many points to be improved , including more suitable forms for velocity - dependent eddington factors .",
    "for example , the eddington factor may depend not on the velocity , but on the velocity gradient . in this field of relativistic radiation tranfer , there still remain many problems to be solved .",
