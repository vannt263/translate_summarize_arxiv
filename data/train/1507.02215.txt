    "this work dedicated to the study of the so - called multilayer saint - venant system , which arises as an approximate model for the propagation of waves in the ocean or atmosphere , when density stratification can not be neglected .",
    "we will refer to as _ free surface system _ the following first - order , quasilinear system of @xmath0 coupled evolution equations : @xmath1 here , the unknowns @xmath2 and @xmath3 represent respectively the deformation of the @xmath4 interface and the layer - averaged horizontal velocity in the @xmath4 layer , at time @xmath5 and horizontal position @xmath6 where @xmath7 ; see figure  [ f.sketchofthedomain ] . if @xmath8 , then we denote @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "we denote by @xmath11 the mass density of the homogeneous fluid in the @xmath4 layer , whereas @xmath12 is the gravitational acceleration .",
    "finally , @xmath13 is the depth of the @xmath4 layer . by convention",
    ", we set @xmath14 ( above the upper free surface is vacuum ) , and @xmath15 ( the bottom is flat ) .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the setting of stable stratification , namely @xmath16        we may rescale the variables so as to replace the factor @xmath17 more precisely , we use the following nondimensionalization : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a characteristic horizontal length ( say the wavelength of the flow ) , @xmath20 is a characteristic vertical length ( say the typical depth of one layer at rest ) , and @xmath21 is a velocity .",
    "such that @xmath22 , then @xmath23 measures the typical velocity of propagation of the baroclinic modes ; see appendix  [ s.spectral ] . ]    although @xmath24 does not appear in our system , it plays a very important role as the saint - venant system may be seen as the first - order asymptotic model obtained from the full multilayer water - wave system in the limit @xmath25 ; see  @xcite in the one - layer case and  @xcite in the bilayer ( albeit irrotational ) setting .",
    "it may also be formally obtained using the hydrostatic and columnar motion assumptions ; see  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we ask + * qn : * _ what is the behaviour of the solutions to   in the limit @xmath26 ? _",
    "the first observation is that the velocity evolution equations become singular , as @xmath27 since @xmath28 by convention , so that even the existence of solutions on a non - trivial time interval is far from straightforward .    at the linear level ,",
    "it is known  @xcite ( see also appendix  [ s.spectral ] ) that the flow may be decomposed into @xmath29 modes , propagating as linear wave equations with distinct velocities . in our setting , the first mode , _",
    "i.e. _  the barotropic mode , propagates much faster than the other , baroclinic modes , in the sense that the former is typically of size @xmath30 while the latter are uniformly bounded when @xmath31 ; hence the singularity .",
    "while such a decomposition is exact only in the linear setting , we show in this work that the flow behaves in a similar way in the weak density contrast limit even when strong nonlinearities are present , provided that the initial surface deformation is small , the depth of each layer remains positive and shear velocities are not too large . roughly speaking ,",
    "we show that one may then approximate the flow as the superposition of rapidly propagating acoustic waves and a non - singular `` slow '' mode with non - trivial dynamics .",
    "let us be more precise .",
    "asymptotically , the fast mode describes the propagation of the free surface , @xmath32 , and total volume flux , namely @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the orthogonal projection onto irrotational vector fields .",
    "one has at first order , in dimension @xmath8 and provided that @xmath32 and @xmath36 are initially balanced so that @xmath37 , the linear acoustic system @xmath38 the slow component contains all the baroclinic modes which interact strongly one with each other in the nonlinear setting .",
    "we show that it is asymptotically described by the _ rigid - lid model _ , which is obtained from the free - surface system by setting @xmath39 in the mass conservation equations , and replacing @xmath40 with @xmath41 in the velocity evolution equations ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , we apply the so - called _ boussinesq approximation _ ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) to the limit system , that is we set @xmath42 in the velocity evolution equations while @xmath43 remains fixed and non - trivial .",
    "this yields @xmath44 with the same notation as before , except @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "in particular , the first equation is not an evolution equation but a constraint ( conservation of total mass ) , namely @xmath47 physically speaking , @xmath48 is ( up to a constant ) the pressure at the flat , rigid lid . from a mathematical viewpoint",
    ", @xmath49 is the lagrange multiplier associated with the above divergence - free constraint .",
    "it may be reconstructed from the knowledge of @xmath50 by solving the poisson equation @xmath51    we thus offer a rigorous justification ( the formal justification is generally attributed to armi  @xcite ) of the widely used rigid - lid and boussinesq approximations for free surface multilayer shallow - water flows with a small density contrast .      before stating our main results ,",
    "let us recall for convenience the system of equations at stake : @xmath52 where @xmath53 with convention @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "in the following , we fix parameters @xmath56 ; and denote @xmath57 we can then reconstruct @xmath58 with @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) and @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the only parameter allowed to vary , and by assumption @xmath63 it is also convenient to denote ( notice the @xmath64 prefactor ; see remark  [ r.small-surface ] below ) @xmath65 so that the control of @xmath66 in sobolev space @xmath67 ( see appendix  [ s.notations ] for notations ) yields , when @xmath8 , @xmath68    let us now state the main results of this work .",

    "[ r.small-surface ] as mentioned in the introduction , our hypotheses contain a smallness assumption on the initial deformation of the surface , namely @xmath97 .",
    "this assumptions is natural so as to balance the contributions in the ( preserved in time ) energy : @xmath98 without this assumption , the flow possesses a strongly nonlinear barotropic component , and energy methods yield a well - posedness theory over a small time - domain , @xmath81 , @xmath99 ; see proposition  [ p.wp-naive ] and remark  [ r.naive ] , below . on this timescale ,",
    "the baroclinic component do not evolve , so that all the dynamics is described by the barotropic component ( asymptotically as @xmath100 ) .",
    "the requirement @xmath83 does not lose in generality in theorem  [ t.wp ] : the case of non - small @xmath62 follows from the standard well - posedness theory of quasilinear systems , as proved by monjarret in  @xcite and stated in proposition  [ p.wp-naive ] , below .    our proof does not rely on , but rather provides , the existence and uniqueness of strong solutions of the limit ( rigid - lid ) system . in that respect ,",
    "one may see the free - surface system   as a penalized model for   relaxing the rigid - lid constraint .",
    "sharper well - posedness results for the rigid - lid system in the two - layer case and without the boussinesq approximation are provided in  @xcite .",
    "theorem  [ t.convergence ] is restricted to @xmath8 because we use dispersive decay estimates on rapidly propagating acoustic waves in order to control nonlinear coupling effects between the fast and slow modes . in the case of dimension @xmath101 , and provided that the initial data is sufficiently localized in space , we justified in  @xcite a similar mode decomposition of the flow , by making use of the different spatial support of each mode after small time .",
    "proposition  4.4 therein , together with proposition  [ p.energy-estimate-hs ] in the present work , offer a convergence between the exact and the approximate solution with rate @xmath102 .",
    "the same convergence rate holds in the case of dimension @xmath8 and well - prepared initial data , in the sense of proposition  [ p.well-prepared initial data ] .    in the following , for the sake of simplicity , we limit our study to the case of dimension @xmath8 , although we find it more telling to keep the notation @xmath103 .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ t.wp ] is easily adapted to the case of dimension @xmath101 .",
    "one could add , without any additional difficulty , a uniformly bounded and order - zero term to the system , so as to take into account for instance the coriolis force , atmospheric pressure variations , or bottom topography .",
    "notice however that these terms should be of size @xmath102 in the evolution equation for @xmath32 ; in particular , only small topography may be dealt with using directly our strategy .",
    "similarly , except in the one - layer case where the the component due to coriolis effect is an anti - symmetric perturbation of a symmetric system , one can not allow a rapid rotation such as in the quasi - geostrophic regime , which would correspond here to @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the rossby number ; see  @xcite .",
    "our results are valid for arbitrary @xmath29 , but not uniformly",
    ". in particular , we can not control the dependence of @xmath106 as @xmath29 grows .",
    "thus our strategy can not be adapted to study the system in the limit @xmath107 , corresponding to the physically relevant situation of continuous stratification .",
    "a similar shortcoming was already noticed and discussed by ripa in @xcite .",
    "a well - posedness result on system   is stated and proved in  @xcite .",
    "it follows from a standard analysis on quasilinear systems since a symbolic symmetrizer may be exhibited ( see section  [ s.wp-naive ] below ) .",
    "however , due to the presence of singular components in the system , the _ a priori _ maximal time of existence of the solutions may be bounded from below only as @xmath108 using this method . such a result is unsuitable for our purpose as the time interval shrinks to zero in the considered limit , and is inconsistent with oceanographic observations of large amplitude internal waves propagating over long distances ; see _ e.g. _  @xcite and references therein .    in order to go beyond this analysis and provide a time of existence of solutions uniformly bounded from below with respect to @xmath62 small , we need to take advantage of some additional structural properties of the system . this structure is put to light by a suitable change of variable , which we describe below .",
    "let us introduce the shear velocities , @xmath109 , and the total horizontal momentum , @xmath110 , as follows : @xmath111 so that , conversely , for any @xmath112 , @xmath113    one may rewrite system   using the new variables as follows : @xmath114 where @xmath115 , and @xmath116 are meant as the expressions in terms of @xmath117 given in  .",
    "the above change of variables may be seen as an approximate normal form allowing to decouple the slow and fast components of the flow . indeed , since @xmath118 one sees immediately that the singular terms appear only as linear components on the evolution equations for @xmath119 and @xmath110 or more precisely @xmath33 and involve only @xmath119 and @xmath33 .",
    "in other words , the leading - order terms form a system of rapidly propagating acoustic waves in @xmath120 : @xmath121 the remainder contains quasilinear components depending on both the fast ( @xmath122 ) and slow ( @xmath123 ) variables , so we need to consider the full system of equations   in order to obtain the desired uniform energy estimates .",
    "let us now , for the sake of simplicity , restrict our discussion to the case of dimension @xmath101 . from the above , we may rewrite the system   as @xmath124\\partial_x{{\\sf v}}=\\partial_t{{\\sf v}}+ \\frac1{\\varrho}{{\\sf l}}\\partial_x{{\\sf v}}+ { { \\sf c}}[{{\\sf v}}]\\partial_x{{\\sf v}}=0\\ ] ] where @xmath125 , so that @xmath126 represents the above acoustic wave system for the fast variables , while @xmath127 ; and @xmath128 $ ] contains lower - order ( in terms of @xmath62 ) and coupling terms .",
    "we shall make use of the fact that one can construct a `` good '' symmetrizer of the system under the form  , namely we exhibit real , positive - definite matrices @xmath129 $ ] such that @xmath129=({{\\sf t}}[{{\\sf v}}])^\\top$ ] and @xmath129{{\\sf b}}[{{\\sf v}}]=({{\\sf t}}[{{\\sf v}}]{{\\sf b}}[{{\\sf v}}])^\\top$ ] , and satisfying the decomposition @xmath130={{\\sf t}}_{(0)}+{{\\sf",
    "t}}_{(1)}[{({{\\sf id}}-{\\sf \\pi}_{\\rm f})}{{\\sf v}}]{({{\\sf id}}-{\\sf \\pi}_{\\rm f})}+{\\mathcal{o}}({\\varrho}),\\ ] ] where @xmath131 is the orthogonal projection onto @xmath132 , the slow variables",
    ". indeed , one obtains an energy estimate by taking the @xmath133 inner - product of the equation with @xmath129{{\\sf v}}$ ] , which only requires to estimate @xmath134{{\\sf b}}[{{\\sf v } } ] ) } _ { l^\\infty}+\\norm { \\partial_t ( { { \\sf t}}[{{\\sf v } } ] ) } _ { l^\\infty}.\\ ] ] using that @xmath135 and @xmath136 are constant operators and that @xmath137\\partial_x{{\\sf v}}={\\mathcal{o}}(1)$ ] , we see that the above are estimated uniformly with respect to @xmath62 small ; thus we have a uniform control of the @xmath133 norm .",
    "the corresponding @xmath138 estimate with @xmath69 does not bring additional difficulties , using that @xmath135 commutes with the fourier multiplier @xmath139 .",
    "there remains to understand why such symmetrizer exists for our system  .",
    "one could check , after tedious calculations , that the explicit one provided by monjarret in  @xcite ( after applying the congruent transformation associated with the change of variables ) satisfies the necessary hypotheses , but we offer in appendix  [ s.spectral ] an alternative and more robust construction .",
    "we show that , provided that @xmath140 satisfies  , , then @xmath141 $ ] has @xmath142 real and distinct eigenvalues .",
    "two of them are asymptotically equivalent to @xmath143 as @xmath100 while the other ones are uniformly bounded with respect to @xmath62 small .",
    "the spectral projection corresponding to the former converge towards the projections onto the eigenspaces corresponding the two non - trivial eigenvalues of @xmath135 . using the scale separation between the eigenvalues",
    ", one shows that the spectral projections corresponding to the latter are uniformly bounded , and that they converge as @xmath144 towards independent , rank - one projections onto subspaces of @xmath132 .",
    "our symmetrizer is then , classically , @xmath130{\\stackrel{\\rm def}{=}}\\sum_{j=1}^{2n } ( { { \\sf p}}_j[{{\\sf v}}])^\\top { { \\sf p}}_j[{{\\sf v}}]\\ ] ] where @xmath145 $ ] is the spectral projection onto the @xmath146 eigenspace of @xmath147 $ ] . that @xmath129 $ ] enjoys the desired properties follows , using standard perturbation theory  @xcite , from the fact that @xmath135 is constant , @xmath148 and the strong scale separation between @xmath149 and uniformly bounded eigenvalues .",
    "an additional difficulty arises in the situation of horizontal dimension @xmath8 , due to the fact that the symmetrizer of the system which is constructed from the symmetrizer in dimension @xmath101 and a rotational invariance property is only a symbolic symmetrizer , as opposed to symmetrizers in the sense of friedrichs .",
    "thus we rely on para - differential calculus , but extra care must be given to `` lower order terms '' in the sense of regularity , which may effectively hurt our energy estimates if they are not uniformly bounded with respect to @xmath62 . as a matter of fact , we use that one can construct an explicit operator ( defined as a fourier multiplier ) which symmetrizes the linear , singular contributions of the system , and use para - differential calculus only on the next order components in terms of @xmath62 .",
    "given the uniform ( with respect to @xmath62 small ) energy estimates , the large time well - posedness ( theorem  [ t.wp ] ) follows from the standard theory for quasilinear hyperbolic systems .",
    "the convergence results ( theorem  [ t.convergence ] as well as additional assertions in section  [ s.convergence ] ) proceed from rather standard techniques in the study of singular systems ; see references below .",
    "in  @xcite , the author studied the so - called inviscid bilayer saint - venant ( or shallow water ) system in the limit of small density contrast .",
    "the change of variables allowing for uniform energy estimates was exhibited therein , and convergence towards a solution of the rigid - lid limit , as well as a second - order approximation , was deduced in the case of well - prepared initial data .",
    "this work is therefore an extension of these results to the situation of ( horizontal ) dimension @xmath8 , ill - prepared initial data as well as arbitrary number of layers .",
    "as already noticed in the aforementioned work , our problem has many similarities with the ( two - dimensional ) incompressible limit for euler equations , as studied initially in  @xcite . as a matter of fact ,",
    "if we consider only one layer of fluid , then our problem corresponds exactly to a special case of the isentropic incompressible limit , and we recover the results of ukai  @xcite and asano  @xcite .",
    "we will not detail the very rich history of results concerning this problem ( we let the reader to @xcite for comprehensive reviews ) but rather aim at pointing out similarities and differences of our situation .",
    "let us first recall the two - dimensional isentropic euler equations for inviscid , barotropic fluids : @xmath150 where @xmath151 is a given pressure law , @xmath152 is the density , @xmath153 the velocity , and @xmath154 the dimensionless mach number . as claimed above , one recognizes exactly   in the one layer setting ( @xmath155 ) , by setting @xmath156 , and identifying @xmath157 of course , the difficulty in our case is that , as one considers additional layers of fluids , these equations are coupled with additional equations on additional unknowns , so as to produce a full quasilinear system . since these additional equations are non - singular with respect to the small parameter , it is tempting to compare our situation with the incompressible limit for the non - isentropic euler equations , where   is coupled with an additional evolution equation for the entropy , @xmath158 : @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "our situation , however , is quite different .",
    "this can be seen from the fact that , contrarily to the non - isentropic euler equations , the linearized system is balanced , in the sense that a small perturbation of the `` slow '' component of the reference state induces only a small deviation for the solution . in other words , using the notation of the above discussion , the symmetrizer of the non - isentropic euler equations does not satisfy @xmath129={{\\sf t}}_{(0)}+{{\\sf t}}_{(1)}[{({{\\sf id}}-{\\sf \\pi}_{\\rm f})}{{\\sf v}}]{({{\\sf id}}-{\\sf \\pi}_{\\rm f})}+{\\mathcal{o}}({\\varrho})$ ] but only @xmath129={{\\sf t}}_{(0)}+{{\\sf t}}_{(1)}[{({{\\sf id}}-{\\sf \\pi}_{\\rm f})}{{\\sf v}}]+{\\mathcal{o}}({\\varrho})$ ] ; see discussion in  @xcite .",
    "this additional property in our situation allows in particular to straightforwardly deduce @xmath138 energy estimates from the corresponding @xmath133 energy estimate ; and to obtain the strong convergence result of theorem  [ t.convergence ] simply from dispersive estimates on the `` acoustic '' component of the flow , as originally carried out by ukai  @xcite and asano  @xcite in the isentropic case .    in order to deal with this situation , mtivier and schochet  @xcite",
    "( see also  @xcite ) rely on the fact that their system enjoys a diagonal block structure and that the symmetrizer commutes exactly with the singular operator , denoted @xmath161 in the above discussion",
    ". roughly speaking , this means that we may control the compressible and isentropic component of the flow independently of the acoustic component by simply projecting onto @xmath132 .",
    "since such assumptions are only approximately satisfied in our situation , our system is rather related to the `` @xmath62-balanced '' ( and not `` @xmath62-diagonal '' ) systems studied by klainerman and majda  @xcite , although we do not restrict ourselves to well - prepared initial data .    in this spirit ,",
    "our proofs rely as little as possible on explicit calculations , thus we expect that the general strategy may be successfully applied to other situations and other frameworks , such as the ones presented in  @xcite .",
    "this is why we use mostly in the following the terminology of `` fast _ vs _ slow '' mode / component instead of `` barotropic _ vs _ baroclinic '' which is more relevant to our initial oceanographic motivation ( see  @xcite ) ; or `` acoustic _ vs _ incompressible '' associated with euler equations .      in section  [ s.wp-naive ]",
    ", we recall that our quasilinear system admits an explicit ( symbolic ) symmetrizer , which yields immediately a well - posedness theory for  , for any fixed @xmath162 .    in section  [ s.normal-form ] , we exhibit the structural properties enjoyed by our system , after the change of variables  , , and which allow the uniform ( with respect to @xmath62 small ) energy estimates provided in section  [ s.energy-estimates-l2 ] ( proposition  [ p.energy-estimate-l2 ] ) and section  [ s.energy-estimates-hs ] ( proposition  [ p.energy-estimate-hs ] ) .",
    "we deduce in section  [ s.wp ] the large - time well - posedness result of theorem  [ t.wp ] .",
    "additionally , we show in proposition  [ p.well-prepared initial data ] that an assumption of well - prepared initial data is propagated by the flow for positive times .",
    "section  [ s.convergence ] is dedicated to convergence results .",
    "we first state in proposition  [ p.weak-convergence ] a weak convergence result for the solutions of the free - surface system as @xmath100 . as in the incompressible limit for euler equations ,",
    "the convergence can not be strong uniformly in time , due to the rapidly propagating fast mode .",
    "however , we show in proposition  [ p.convergence-wp ] that this small initial layer in time vanishes in the case of well - prepared initial data , and then characterize the defect for general initial data in section  [ s.convergence-strong ] , yielding theorem  [ t.convergence ] .",
    "appendix  [ s.notations ] contains a description of some notations used throughout the text , as well as a short review of standard results concerning product and commutator estimates in sobolev spaces ( section  [ s.product ] ) and bony s paradifferential calculus ( section  [ s.para ] ) .",
    "finally , appendix  [ s.spectral ] is dedicated to some results on the eigenstructure of our system , which are used in section  [ s.normal-form ] .",
