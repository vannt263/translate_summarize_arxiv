    "variational inequalities ( vis ) provide a versatile background for the analysis and modelling of physical phenomena which involve free boundary problems .",

    "the wide range of applications of this kind of free boundary problems make the analysis and the numerical simulation of their associated vis a quite interesting and challenging field of research .    on the other hand",
    ", the @xmath0-laplacian operator has been widely analysed as a model case for quasilinear and degenerate elliptic equations ( see @xcite ) . regarding the @xmath0-laplacian problem ,",
    "several analytical results , concerning existence and multiplicity of solutions , have been obtained in , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite .",
    "further , the numerical analysis of the @xmath0-laplacian problem has been a productive field of research .",
    "mainly , the finite element approximation has been broadly studied in the literature in , for example , @xcite and the references therein .",
    "the numerical realisation of the @xmath0-laplacian has been carried out by the augmented lagrangian method @xcite and , recently , by using optimization and variational techniques @xcite and multigrid algorithms @xcite .    in spite of the fact that the @xmath0-laplacian operator is a extensively studied field , scarce work can be found in the numerical analysis of variational inequalities involving this differential operator .",
    "the obstacle problem with associated operator of the @xmath0-laplacian type has been analyzed in @xcite .",
    "there , the authors analize a finite element approximation of the problem and provide error estimates for such approximation . in @xcite , the obstacle problem in the context of a glaceology application has been studied .",
    "the authors consider a variational inequality of the first kind , involving the @xmath0-laplacian operator .",
    "they analyze the existence , uniqueness and regularity of solutions , and propose a finite element approximation of the problem .",
    "elliptic and parabolic quasi - variational inequalities involving quasilinear operators are considered in @xcite . in these papers ,",
    "the authors propose and study a semismooth newton approach for the numerical solution of these problems , and provide several theoretical results regarding existence and regularity of solutions .",
    "finally , in @xcite , the authors propose a finite dimensional descent algorithm for the numerical solution of several differentiable problems , including the classical dirichlet @xmath0-laplacian problem and a class of variational inequalities wich combines the laplacian and the @xmath0-laplacian operators , for @xmath1 .",
    "in contrast with the previous contributions , in this paper we are concerned with variational inequalities of the second kind . the importance of this class of variational inequalities lies on the fact that they can be used to model the flow of a particular class of viscoplastic materials : the herschel - bulkley fluids .",
    "herschel - bulkley is a power - law model with plasticity .",
    "this model is used to simulate some materials whose behaviour depends on the flow index @xmath0 .",
    "this constant measures the degree to which the fluid is shear - thinning ( @xmath2 ) or shear - thickening ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the herschel - bulkley model can be seen as a generalization of the classical bingham model , which is retrieved from the first one by taking @xmath4 ( @xcite ) .",
    "depending on the value of the power index , this model can be used to simulate a wide range of materials from nail polish or whipped cream ( shear - thinning fluids ) to quicksand or silly putty ( shear - thickening fluids ) ( see @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the herschel - bulkley model has proved to be accurate in the modelling of blood , a known shear - thinning fluid @xcite",
    ".    in consequence , the numerical resolution of vis involving a @xmath0-laplacian operator is an important research field .",
    "a classical approach to these problems is the augmented lagrangian method ( see @xcite ) , while , from our point of view , the application of optimization and variational techniques has not been explored enough in this context .",
    "several optimization problems involving non differentiable functionals have been successfully analyzed by using this approach ( see @xcite ) .",
    "further , the analysis of this kind of methods in function spaces is a challenging but promising research field .    as stated before , in this paper we are concerned with a class of variational inequalities of the second kind involving the @xmath0-laplacian operator and the @xmath5-norm of the gradient .",
    "our main intention is to develop an efficient algorithm for the numerical solution of these problems .",
    "the main challenge in this aim consists in designing a numerical strategy , which allows to obtain an accurate solution with a fast convergent method . in the context of numerical solution of vis of the second kind , the local smoothing techniques , such as huber regularization ,",
    "have proved to be an effective way to achieve such a goal ( see @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we study the variational inequality as an equivalent minimization problem of a non differentiable functional , and we regularize the functional by a huber procedure .",
    "further , the convergence of the regularized solutions to the original one is established .    for the numerical solution of the vis under study ,",
    "we propose a preconditioned descent algorithm in function spaces .",
    "several issues arise in this approach .",
    "mainly , we need to discuss the existence of admissible search directions and admissible step sizes .",
    "admissibility of step sizes depends on the line search strategy .",
    "here , we propose a backtracking algorithm which approximates the objective functional by polynomial models . in this way",
    ", the algorithm provides admissible step sizes with low computational effort .",
    "the existence of admissible search directions is analyzed considering the two cases @xmath2 and @xmath3 , separately . in the case",
    "@xmath2 , we first discuss the properties of a suitable hilbert space in which we will propose and analyse the algorithm .",
    "next , we define the preconditioner and prove the existence of admissible search directions .",
    "this is achieved by discussing the conditions for the zoutendijk condition to hold ( @xcite ) . finally , we state and prove a global convergence result for this algorithm .",
    "the case @xmath3 poses analytical issues which prevent us from studying the algorithms in function spaces .",
    "in fact , it is not possible to prove existence of admissible search directions in the same function space in which the elliptic preconditioner is defined .",
    "we discuss in detail these issues and propose an alternative algorithm in a finite element space .",
    "next , we state and prove a global convergence result for this algorithm as well .",
    "though the descent algorithms are usually slow , in our case the design of suitable preconditioners and the use of an innovative line search algorithm help us to obtain a robust algorithm which only needs the solution of one linear system per iteration .",
    "further , since the algorithms are proposed , at least in the @xmath2 case , in function spaces , they are expected to exhibit mesh independence .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : statandreg ] we introduce and analyze the variational inequality and its associated optimization problem .",

    "let us turn our attention to problem .",
    "first , we define @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and we identify the dual space of @xmath58 with @xmath59 ( see ( * ? ? ? * th . 4.11 ) ) .",

    "it can be easily verified that these two functionals are convex , continuous and proper .",

    "@xmath77    the active and inactive sets of the problem are defined by @xmath78 respectively .",
    "the non - differentiability of problem can provoke instabilities in several numerical schemes , such as a primal - dual algorithm ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this issue can be appreciated in the fact that system does not have a unique solution .",
    "further , this lack of regularity prevents us from developing an algorithm based on optimization techniques , as proposed . a classical approach to this kind of problems",
    "is regularization .",
    "however , the question about what kind of regularization procedure is the most suitable is a hot topic ( see @xcite ) .    in this work",
