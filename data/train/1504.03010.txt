    "if we consider , instead , a circular disk of radius @xmath16 and an annulus of inner radius @xmath17 and outer radius @xmath18 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : att]b ) , we can then impose a homothetic transformation independently on either the disk or the annulus . by defining @xmath19 as the mismatch between the disk and the annulus , it is immediately apparent that if @xmath20 the two structures are incompatible and the annulus must be stretched ( @xmath21 ) or compressed ( @xmath22 ) to fit the circular disk ( fig .",
    "[ fig : att]c ) . when the inner radius of the annulus is bonded to the edge of the circular disk ,",
    "the resulting disk is a geometric composite that may be roughly modeled as a body having the following target metric in polar coordinates @xmath23 this metric is flat within each of the two domains , but the metric of the geometric composite is not flat , _ i.e. _ there does not exist any parabola that fits @xmath24 , the azimuthal covariant metric coefficient . as in",

    "the energy is quadratic in @xmath38 and therefore can be minimized analytically ; notice that , if the annulus is neither deformed ( @xmath40 ) nor present ( @xmath41 ) , the energy is a simple parabola in @xmath38 with the minimum at @xmath42 since the disk is not constrained , and does not need to bend .",
    "similarly , when the disk is not considered ( @xmath43 ) , the annulus does not need to bend either , and stays flat ( @xmath42 ) with a radial stretch equal to @xmath44 .",
    "once the stretching energy is minimized , we observe that the bending energy density is equal to @xmath45 for dome  like shapes  ( @xmath46 ) and to  @xmath47 for saddle  like shapes . in the latter case , since  @xmath48 , the disk tries to morph into a minimal surface  ( @xmath49 ) .",

    "the annuli of polyvinylsiloxane elastomer were stretched homothetically and bonded to the inner disk . upon release from the molds ,",
    "the disks spontaneously morphed into domes or saddles .",
    "the annuli may be thought of as springs that want to release the energy by recovering their original shapes : for example , figure  [ fig : att ]  ( c ) shows how the annulus must be compressed to get a saddle .",
    "we measured the shape of the deformed disks to determine the two principal radii of curvature , and plotted the gaussian curvature in figure  [ fig : att ] .",
    "these measurements confirmed the assumption used in our analysis that  @xmath38 is approximately constant across the disk .",
    "we also carried out numerical simulations to solve the problem within the context of finite incompressible tridimensional elasticity with large distortions using a neo  hookean material model  @xcite implemented in the commercial software comsol multiphysics .",

    "this explains why the realized metric stays in between the target metrics , and closer to the target metric in the disk .",

    "this indetermination does not affect the predictability of axisymmetric shapes like domes , but it does affect the one of saddles that have an axisymmetric metric but a not axisymmetric embedding . while we can predict the magnitude of the principal curvatures , the principal directions of curvature are dictated by imperfections in both experiments and numerics when the target metric is hyperbolic .     as the disk is stretched homothetically .",

    "when this ratio is between @xmath82 and @xmath83 , the gaussian curvature can not be approximated as homogenous throughout the disk but attains two constant values in the inner disk and the annulus .",
    "however , the metric does not diverge much from the constant curvature solution , and the analytical model gives a result that is in good agreement with the mean gaussian curvature of the disk , which is exactly what we measured experimentally .",

    "residual swelling is a fairly more complicated phenomenon than the geometrical confinement that dictated the shape change in the simplified mechanical problem . swelling ",
    "induced deformations can not be seen as distortions , as they are related to both the elastic properties of the gel , and the chemical conditions of the residual free polymer chains . moreover , in this case swelling is driven by the concentration gradient of these chains across the entire structure .",
    "we used the circular molds of the mechanical analog to cast samples with polyvinylsiloxane as shown in figure  [ figcartoon ] ( pvs  zhermack elite double 32 for the annulus and zhermack elite double 8 for the inner disk ) .",

    "we measured the time evolution of the gaussian curvature of each disk with the same procedure used for the mechanical analog , repeated every three hours .      while this problem couples nonlinear geometric mechanics with elastomer swelling , we can provide insight into this process by incorporating swelling into our mechanical analogy .",
    "the stretching ratio @xmath44 now dictates the metric that each part of the disk would realize upon swelling if it were free ( not bonded to the other ) .",
    "the inner disk and the annulus would like to shrink and swell , respectively , as molecules are flowing from the former to the latter .",
    "we assume that if the annulus would like to swell by a factor @xmath44 , the inner disk would like to shrink by a factor @xmath90 . incorporating the difference between the two young s moduli ,",
    "the functional in equation   is modified as @xmath91 notice that , since no pre ",
    "stretch is applied , the radius of the disk is @xmath18 , _ i.e. _ it coincides with the outer radius of the green annulus .",
    "the young s moduli of the green annulus and the pink disk are denoted as @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively . and",
    "its variation with swelling is neglected . ]",
    "to analytically determine how @xmath44 should vary with @xmath87 , we denoted as @xmath94 and @xmath95 the concentrations of the diffusive species in the disk and in the annulus , respectively . since molecules flowed from the disk to the annulus , we fixed @xmath96 and imposed the conservation of mass as @xmath97 , where  @xmath98 denotes the concentration at equilibrium .",
    "then , we reasoned that the stretching ratio @xmath44 will be proportional to the cubic root of the mass uptake inside the annulus so that @xmath99 .",

    "the presence of a concentration gradient of polymer chains with a polydisperse molecular weight makes identifying this parameter difficult , and beyond the scope of this work .",
    "qualitatively , the bigger the free chains , the higher @xmath101 should be . notice that @xmath44 is equal to @xmath58 when the mass uptake is zero , that is when the structure is homogeneous ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "this is the important difference with the mechanical analog , since  @xmath101 is not known for swelling as it depends on the material and chemical properties of the elastomers ; we therefore used it as a fitting parameter .",
    "figure  [ fig : kr ] shows the stationary values of the gaussian curvature of the seven disks after residual swelling as obtained in the experiments ( triangles ) , numerics ( circles ) and analytics ( solid curve ) .",
    "numerical and analytical results are obtained by using   in   and setting @xmath103 equal to  @xmath104 that sets @xmath105 from  .",
    "the three linear regimes identified in figure  [ fig : kr ] point out that the maximum of the gaussian curvature is not attained for @xmath106 but for @xmath107 .",
    "a similar result was obtained for the mechanical analog as can be seen in the inset in figure  [ fig : att ] .",
    "these two observations let us conclude that both the dimensionality of the swelling and simple geometry shift the maximum of the gaussian curvature to high radii ratios instead of @xmath106 . by the conservation of mass , it can be demonstrated that if the swelling had been @xmath58d , the maximum mass uptake would have been attained at @xmath106 ; if it had been @xmath0d , the maximum would have been attained at @xmath108 . in our @xmath1d case ,",
    "the maximum is attained when @xmath109 as also experiments showed .",
    "so , in general , if @xmath110 is the dimensionality of the swelling , the maximum mass uptake is achieved for @xmath111 .",
    "the agreement among experiments , numerics and analytics is quite good , and it is remarkable that the analytical model captures the linear regimes with the same slopes .",

    "this simplified expression is represented in figure  [ fig : kr ] as a grey dashed line , and is very close to the full solution : the linear regimes highlighted in the figure are in excellent agreement with our timoshenko  like formula .",
    "the physical interpretation of our first order taylor approximation is that the strains are assumed to be small , which is the same limit that timoshenko obtained his formula within .",

    "three different regimes may be identified as the radii ratio varies . in the first one ( i )",

    "we assume that the swelling dynamics may be described as a diffusive process with a fourier  like differential equation .",
    "the main features of a diffusive equation are that it is of the first order in time , giving rise to transients that are described by the exponential of time up to the steady  state , and of the second order in space ( quasi1d in our case ) .",
    "as we are studying the transient by looking at a homogeneous field  the gaussian curvature @xmath38  we focus on its variation with time , and note that the dashed lines in figure  [ fig : kt ]  ( a ) correspond to an exponential of time ( @xmath117 ) , as expected .",

    "] this numerical fitting is shown in the plot as a straight dashed grey line . following activation ,",
    "the diffusive shape change is characterized by the time constant  @xmath123 that dictates the time scale of the transient as it is the time at which the gaussian curvature reaches the  @xmath124 of its stationary value .",
    "figure  [ fig : kt ]  ( a ) shows that the disk corresponding to @xmath125 is faster than the other geometries ; indeed , we found that its time constant is approximately @xmath126  h whereas all the other disks have @xmath127  h as shown in figure  [ fig : kt ]  ( c ) .",
    "as this is a diffusive process , we expect the dynamics will scale with the square of the characteristic length scale in the problem .",
    "we believe the observed difference in dynamics is the result of a change in the relevant characteristic length scale , _",
    "i.e. _ from the total radius of the disk to the width of the annulus . the characteristic time scale ( time constant ) of a diffusive process is equal to @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is the characteristic length and @xmath130 is the diffusivity . while the latter is a property of the materials , the former is dictated by geometry . to identify the characteristic length",
