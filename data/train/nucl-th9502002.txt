    "physics of quark - gluon plasma is one of the most important problems in high energy physics .",
    "quark - gluon plasma state is expected to be produced in extremely high temperature , which will be realized in ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions . to obtain the higher temperature ,",
    "experimental setting has been growing in three directions : the higher incident energy par nucleon , the heavier incident nucleus , and the heavier target nucleus . in any case , colliding energy is getting larger , but the larger energy does not directly mean the higher temperature .",
    "it is not obvious , whether large fraction of colliding energy will be transferred into thermal energy ( temperature ) or kinetic energy ( systematic flow ) .",
    "especially , the heavier target does not correspond to the larger colliding velocity in the center of mass system .",
    "hence , if we stand on the landau - type  simple stopping \" picture , achieved energy density must become lower for larger target mass . in this paper",
    ", we will analyze the recent experimental data for various target nuclei and discuss systematic change of initial parameters in hydrodynamical model .    in a previous paper@xcite we formulated a semi - phenomenological quantum transport theory for a quark - gluon plasma fluid based on an operator valued langevin equation .",
    "putting a mode spectrum and a damping into this formula , we can easily evaluate thermodynamical quantities and transport coefficients . introducing a simple model spectrum to this formula",
    ", we have already discussed the space - time evolution of ( 1 + 1)-dimensional viscous quark - gluon plasma fluid @xcite and ( 3 + 1)-dimensional perfect fluid quark - gluon plasma with phase - transition @xcite .",
    "we have also discussed the case of baryon - rich quark - gluon plasma with phase - transition @xcite , in which one of the conclusions was that the baryon - number effect was not so much large .",
    "hence , although the existing experiments do not seem to be baryon - free , we apply a simple baryon - free quark - gluon plasma model to analyses of available experiments .",
    "following @xcite , we here introduce a simple model mode spectrum , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a parameter that adjusts the degrees of modes and @xmath3 is the critical temperature responsible for the reliant phase transition .",
    "supposing that the high temperature phase is dominated by massless u- , d- , s - quarks and gluons and the hadronic phase is dominated by pions and kaons , we can put @xmath4 , @xmath5 mev , @xmath6 mev , and @xmath7 mev . with these parameters",
    ", we can easily obtain an equation of state with phase transition - like behavior ( fig.1 ) , which seems to reproduce the lattice qcd result @xcite .",
    "the hydrodynamical equation is given by , @xmath8 for perfect fluid . here",
    "@xmath9,@xmath10 and @xmath11 are , respectively , energy density , pressure and local four velocity . for cylindrically symmetric expansion along the collision axis ,",
    "it is convenient to introduce new variables , @xmath12 ,  @xmath13 ,  @xmath14 and @xmath15 defined by @xmath16 instead of ordinary coordinate @xmath17 ,  @xmath18 ,  @xmath19 and @xmath20 . as for the local four velocity",
    ", we represent it by four components , @xmath21 ,  @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 associated with the new variables , @xmath25 because of @xmath26 and the cylindrical symmetry , the four components can be reduced to two variables @xmath27 and @xmath28@xcite , @xmath29    taking account of the formation time , let us put the temperature distribution on @xmath13 and @xmath14 at @xmath30 , @xmath31 assuming that the hydrodynamical expansion starts at @xmath32 fm later than the collision instance at @xmath33 fm .",
    "@xmath34 represents the initial temperature , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are measures of the longitudinal and transverse spreads in @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "@xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36,@xmath37 and @xmath38 are input parameters to characterize our model on which we should impose a constraint given by a fixed value of the initial fluid energy @xmath39 ( @xmath40 standing for the total collision energy and @xmath41 for the inelasticity ) . as for the initial condition of the local velocity",
    ", we use bjorken s scaling solution , @xmath42 , in the longitudinal direction , by which we can take the initial longitudinal flow into account .",
    "initial values of these parameters should be determined on the basis of an appropriate physical discussion , but details of these parameters are deeply connected to the interaction mechanism and the thermalization process . in this paper , standing on _ phenomenological _ point of view , we try to choose these parameters so as to reproduce experimental results of both momentum spectrums .",
    "the numerical solution of the hydrodynamical equation gives us the momentum distribution of hadrons , coming out from a local system with volume @xmath43 in local equilibrium with freeze - out temperature @xmath44 , through the formula @xmath45 where @xmath46 with hadron mass @xmath47 ( see ref.@xcite ) . integrating eq.([5.3 ] ) on the hypersurface with @xmath44",
    ", we obtain @xmath48 for the y - distribution , @xmath49 for @xmath50-distribution , where @xmath51 stands for the pseudorapidity distribution , and @xmath52 for the @xmath53-distribution .    our numerical results given by eq.([5.5 ] )",
    "is shown in fig.2 .",
    "as is well known , the freeze - out temperature @xmath54 is directly connected with the @xmath53 slope and we should determine it from the experimental @xmath53-spectrum .",
    "however , throughout this paper , we fix it equal to @xmath55mev because of the lack of sufficient experimental data .",
    "our numerical solution of hydrodynamical model is so designed as to describe the head - on collision of the same kind of nuclei in the center of mass system . in order to apply the solution to the asymmetric collision , such as wa80 and na35",
    ", we estimated effective participants in large target nucleus as , @xmath56,\\ ] ] @xmath57 and @xmath58 being target mass and projectile mass , respectively .",
    "our hydrodynamical model contains many parameters to be adjusted .",
    "we have already fixed freeze - out temperature as @xmath55mev from fig.2 in the previous section . we may put formation time equal to @xmath59 fm and initial transverse size equal to the size of smaller nucleus ,    @xmath60{a_{proj } } - \\sigma_{r }   \\mbox{\\quad ( fm)},\\ ] ]    where @xmath61 . as for the local velocity ,",
    "we use bjorken s scaling solution , @xmath42 , neglecting initial transverse flow .",
    "therefore , the residual parameters to be adjusted are only initial temperature @xmath62 at central point , and longitudinal size at initial time , @xmath63 and @xmath37 .",
    "we try to adjust these parameters so as to reproduce existing experiments .",
    "our results for sulphur beam experiments are shown in fig.3 , and the values of parameters for sulphur and for oxygen beam are summarized in table 1 . in any case , our model seems to reproduce the experimental results well with plausible values of the parameters .",
    "table 2 stands for the results given by a equation of state in the limit @xmath64 , which corresponds to a hot hadron - gas model . in this case",
    ", @xmath41 became an unphysical value , larger than unity .",
    "it means that _ we failed to reproduce experimental results with the hot hadron - gas model_.    these results tell us that larger nuclei are more effective to make a high temperature fluid than smaller nuclei can do even in target experiment . for larger targets ,",
    "the initial temperature must become higher , the longitudinal size smaller , and the inelasticity larger .",
    "this kind of tendency is just desired for the experimental quark - gluon plasma production .",
    "sometimes , it has been pointed out that the present cern energy is not high enough to make the bjorken s scaling quark - gluon plasma , and the stopping picture of landau type is then realized . however , the simple stopping picture is not in agreement with our results . in the simple stopping picture ,",
    "the only collision parameter is the colliding relative velocity @xmath65 , and the longitudinal size contracts with @xmath66 and the energy density increases with @xmath67 . in target experiments ,",
    "the larger target mass means the higher collision energy , but does not means the higher collision velocity .",
    "table 3 shows the our results and relative velocities .",
    "the tendency is opposite to the simple landau picture .",
    "of course , it only means the failure of the _ simple _ stopping picture and we may describe the phenomena which require to introduce additional phenomenological parameters , such as energy dependent inelasticity @xcite .    in this paper , we have fitted hydrodynamical parameters in a purely phenomenological manner without resorting to any dynamical model for initial collision process .",
    "although we need a dynamical model for the quark - gluon plasma formation to understand the results in the table 1 , we may extrapolate our phenomenological results in order to obtain the rough sketch of coming experiments .",
    "figure 4 indicates us that parameters in pb + pb 150 gev / a collision are @xmath68mev and @xmath69 .",
    "the possible psuedorapidity - distribution of hadrons is shown in fig .",
    "5 and the total charged hadronic multiplicity ( pions and kaons ) reaches 2095 .",
    "we have applied our ( 3 + 1)-dimensional hydrodynamical model with phase - transition to the recent heavy - ion experiments .",
    "our results show that the inelasticity increases with target mass , the longitudinal size is getting smaller with target mass , and the initial temperature becomes higher .",
    "such a tendency is very promising for our aim of producing quark - gluon plasma experimentally and also for understanding the future experimental results at cern and rhic .",
