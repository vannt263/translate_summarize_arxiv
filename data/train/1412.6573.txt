    "sound propagation plays a fundamental role in understanding the superfluid behavior @xcite .",
    "ever since the first achievement of bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) in atomic gases , the sound velocity has been one of the first things to be studied theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite on a bec in the presence of harmonic traps @xcite , optical lattices @xcite and disorder @xcite , etc .",
    "more recently , the studies on the sound velocity have been renewed , which are much more in line with its important applications in quantum simulations involving superfluid @xcite . for instance , in recent proposals concerning the preparations of many - body states and non - equilibrium quantum phases based on engineering a superfluid reservoir @xcite , the sound velocity acts as a key parameter in determining the system - bath coupling .",
    "the control of sound velocity of a superfluid , such as by using various carefully configured external traps @xcite , therefore constitutes an important ingredient of the reservoir engineering .    in this work , we study the sound velocity of a bec loaded in an optical superlattice ( osl ) . the motivation behind this work ties closely to the recent progress in engineering novel optical lattices in atomic setups , which is highlighted by the advances in the superlattice technology .",
    "compared with conventional monochromatic optical lattice ( ol ) , an osl is characterized by several distinguishing features @xcite that we have : ( i ) an additional ol of @xmath1 periodicity superimposed on a fundamental ol of @xmath2 periodicity , and ( ii ) a complete control of the relative phase between two lattices . in the early days of osl experiments , the most of investigations have either focused on the static and dynamical properties of the condensate like the coherence @xcite or employed two non - commensurate lattices to simulate disorder quantum system @xcite .",
    "more recently , emphasis has been shifted to a bec loaded in an osl that has emerged as a novel kind of superfluid with tunable real - space lattice topologies ( sub - structures within the unit cell ) and band structures @xcite . in more details , loading cold atoms in an osl with configurable structures , together with non - equilibrium control of lattice intensity and phases , has led to , for example , the observation of the zak phase connected to the topology of the band structure at one dimension ( 1d ) @xcite , as well as opened a new avenue in atomic implementations @xcite , such as the simulations of dirac fermions in interacting relativistic field theories @xcite , and the controlled coherent transport of atomic wave packets @xcite or charge pumping @xcite . along this research line",
    ", we expect that an osl can lead to new features on the sound velocity not present in the conventional monochromatic ol .    to further motivate our investigation on the sound velocity of a bec in an osl , we first recall that , in an ol , the behavior of sound velocity of a bec is believed to be determined by the interplay among three parameters : the strength of the optical lattice , @xmath3 ; the interaction between atoms , @xmath4 ; and the lattice dimension , d ( d=1 , 2 , and 3 ) .",
    "theoretical studies have shown : ( i ) when d=1 , the sound velocity always decreases monotonically with increasing @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "( ii ) for d=2 and 3 , when @xmath4 exceeds a critical value , the sound speed first increases to a maximum value and then decreases with increasing @xmath3 @xcite . when d=3 , the sound velocity can even oscillate with respect to @xmath3 @xcite",
    ". such rich behavior of sound velocity in an ol can be understood in terms of compressibility @xmath5 and effective mass @xmath6 as @xmath7 .",
    "so far all the investigations suggest that the sound velocity of an optically - trapped 1d bec always decreases monotonically with increasing the lattice strength . considering that both @xmath8 and @xmath5 may be strongly affected by the topological structure of a 1d osl due to the introduction of additional freedom",
    ", we expect that a different behavior of sound velocity of a bec in an osl may occur .    in this paper",
    ", we are then motivated to launch systematic studies on an interacting bec loaded into an osl at quasi-1d using both the analytical and numerical methods and show that these systems display the nontrivial properties of the sound velocity , which share the same physical origins of sound velocity in 2d ( 3d ) bec in terms of @xmath9 .",
    "for example , our analytical results in the limit of weak potential display that both the relative phase and the strength of the two lattices that form a 1d osl can significantly influence the sound velocity of a bec . in particular , a surprise indeed arises that the sound velocity can first increase and then decrease when the osl strength increases even at 1d , which presents a contrast to a quasi-1d bec in a 1d monochromatic ol where the sound velocity always decrease with increasing lattice strength",
    ". such behavior of sound velocity are then verified by the numerical results and can be understood in terms of the competition between the compressibility @xmath5 and the effective mass @xmath8 . in addition , our further numerical results show that the sound velocity exhibits very rich behavior with respect to various choices of osl parameters .",
    "our study suggests a new route to engineer the sound velocity by loading a superfluid in an osl .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : model ]",
    "we derive the effective model for a quasi-1d bec in an osl . in section  sec : methods we study the sound propagation and its velocity of the model system , using both analytical and numerical approaches , in different parameter regimes , and finally in section  [ sec : summary ] we summarize our results and give an outlook .",
    "we consider a bulk bec ( see fig . [ fig:1]a ) trapped in an osl of @xmath10 along the @xmath11-direction , whereas the model system is uniform in the @xmath12- and the @xmath13-directions @xcite .",
    "the osl of @xmath10 is made of a fundamental lattice in the @xmath11-direction with the spatial period @xmath14 denoted as the primary lattice , and an additional lattice with a period @xmath15 named by the secondary lattice .",

    "such an osl in equation ( [ eq1 ] ) has been experimentally realized for quantum gases in references @xcite with @xmath20 depending on the internal state of an atom ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1]b for a typical scheme of osl in bosonic atomic gases ) . for the condensate density along the transverse directions in uniform , the freedom along @xmath12- and @xmath13-directions decouples from the @xmath11-direction , leading to the realization of a quasi-1d geometry",

    "this feature immediately distinguishes the bloch state in an osl from the one in an ol , where @xmath59 must be real .",
    "the origin of such difference is that the conventional ol of @xmath81 has a parity symmetry ( @xmath82 ) , which dictates the imaginary part of @xmath59 to varnish , whereas an osl of @xmath83 usually does not have such symmetry , i.e. @xmath84 for @xmath85 .",
    "in addition , the superposition of an additional lattice gives rise to the emergence of substructures in each lattice unit cell in the real space , which can result in substantial modification of the band structure .",
    "for example , for suitable choices of @xmath86 and @xmath20 as have been pointed out in references @xcite , the dispersion relation in the region between the first and second bloch band can be tuned to be linear , a feature reminiscent of relativistic particles .      for an optically trapped bec",

    "the sound propagation and its velocity can be viewed from two different perspectives @xcite .",

    "this can be traced back to the fact that the substructures in each lattice well have been neglected in the tight - binding treatment , which nevertheless plays increasingly important role on determining the sound speed for larger @xmath162 .     in unit of @xmath166 for a bec in an osl via the osl strength of @xmath171 .",

    "[ fig:4 ] ) , we choose a strong intensity @xmath167 ( @xmath187 in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] ) , and scan the sound velocity as a function of @xmath66 for various choice of @xmath46 . as shown in figures [ fig:4]a and [ fig:4]b , it turns out that the sound velocity achieves a maximum value for @xmath188 , @xmath189 .",
    "these results in figures [ fig:4]a and [ fig:4]b are not conflict with equation ( [ eq21 ] ) , which suggests that a maximum of sound velocity can be only developed for @xmath188 , @xmath189 , because equation ( [ eq21 ] ) becomes to be invalid in the case of strong @xmath3 .",
    "we attribute the explanation for figures [ fig:4]a and [ fig:4]b to the competition between the compressibility and effective mass through equation ( [ eq13 ] ) and such competition is supposed to manifest itself quite differently with respect to the various choices of osl s parameters , resulting in the difference between figures [ fig:3 ] and [ fig:4 ] . on the other hand , motivated by reference @xcite , another possible intuitive explanation for sound velocity in  figures [ fig:3 ] and [ fig:4 ]  can be carried out in terms of the effective dimensionality seen by a bec .",
    "the lattice of @xmath66 consists of the @xmath11-direction of our system , while the introduction of the strong strength @xmath3 plays the role of squeezing a bec reminiscent of the other spatial dimensionality of the model system .",
    "therefore , we can reasonably view our system as an effective 2d bec loaded in a monochromatic ol with the role of the dimensionality taken by the @xmath3 from the view of they both squeezing the condensate .",
    "figures [ fig:3 ] and [ fig:4 ] become to be understood in the framework of reference @xcite , i.e. sound velocity of an optically - trapped bec in 2d may develop a maximum with the increasing lattice strength . more importantly , in figure [ fig:4 ] , the maximum of sound velocity can exceed that for @xmath181 with the same @xmath3 by @xmath190 .",
    "moreover , the maximum falls into the superfluid regimes , and should be observable within the current experimental conditions . finally , to make our investigation of sound velocity",
    "more completely , we have plotted figure [ fig:5 ] with the fixed value of @xmath188 , which shows how the sound velocity varies via both the @xmath191 and @xmath192 .",
    "meanwhile , as shown by the right panel of figures [ fig:2]-[fig:4 ] , we have monitored that the exponent @xmath0 of off - diagonal one - body density matrix is always much smaller than 1 , justifying the calculations of sound speed in the framework of the mean - field theory based on gpe .",
    "note that our study on the sound propagation has been done based on the gpe which consists of ignoring the quantum fluctuations and temperature effects .",
    "to study the effects of finite temperature and fluctuations , particularly near the transition point of superfluid and mott insulator , one has to use other theories @xcite .",
    "the present model on the sound velocity of a quasi-1d bec in an osl is based on gpe and highlights the competition between the compressibility @xmath5 and the effective mass @xmath8 .",
    "we have shown that the sound velocity is characterized by four parameters : the effective interatomic interaction @xmath4 , the lattice intensities @xmath20 and the relative phase @xmath46 between the fundamental lattice and the double - period lattice .",
    "all these quantities are experimentally controllable using state - of - the - art technologies .",
    "the interatomic interaction can be controlled in a very versatile manner via the technology of feshbach resonances @xcite . in typical experiments to date @xcite , the values of @xmath4 range from @xmath193 to @xmath194 .",
    "the strength of both @xmath3 and @xmath66 an be tuned from @xmath195 to @xmath196 almost at will .",
    "phase control @xcite between the two standing wave fields allows @xmath46 to scan the whole range @xmath197 $ ] .     in unit of @xmath166 for a bec in an osl via both the lattice strengths of @xmath167 and @xmath171 .",
    "the parameters are given by @xmath175 and @xmath170.,scaledwidth=46.0% ]    central to testing the validity of the prediction in this article is the experimental ability to measure the sound velocity in a bec .",
    "the experimental approaches so far to sound velocity are based on analyzing the linear response of a fluid to an external velocity boost .",
    "the key quantity to measure in these approaches is the dynamic structure factor of the model system @xcite .",
    "the speed of sound of a bec in an ol may be measured with a similar technique as was used in references @xcite .",
    "another option is to employ bragg spectroscopy @xcite to the excitation spectrum .",
    "the sound velocity can be extracted from the slope of the linear part of the excitation spectrum .",
    "another difficulty may arise from the typical application of an external harmonic trap with the frequency of @xmath198 in the bec experiments , which will lead to the discrete spectrum due to the finite size of the trapped bec @xcite .",
    "the detailed concern is as follows : our definition of sound velocity is based on equation ( [ eq13 ] ) , where the presence of the ol has been accounted for through renormalizing compressibility @xmath5 and the effective mass @xmath8 . as a result , despite the presence of the lattice , one can study the sound velocity of a bec using equation ( [ eq13 ] ) as if the space is homogeneous .",
    "in such , with the considerations of the harmonic trap , the condensate wave - function is non - vanishing over a size of the @xmath199 in the thomas - fermi approximation . as a compression ,",
    "the frequencies of the lowest collective excitations are proportional to @xmath200 , being simply proportional to the trapping frequencies , which do not yield direct information of the sound velocity .",
    "therefore , in order to observe the sound speed , one must excite the perturbation much smaller than the size of the condensate by ruling out the collective excitation of the model system .",
    "on overcoming the preceding two difficulties , the experimental realization of our scenario amounts to controlling four parameters whose interplay underlies the physics of this work .",
    "therefore , the phenomena discussed in this article should be observable within the current experimental capability , which would constitute an important step in understanding the effect of an osl on the superfluidity of a bec .    in summary ,",
    "we have studied analytically and numerically the sound speed of a 1d bec in an osl .",
    "our results show that the interplay between two constituting lattices that have different periods can significantly influence the sound velocity of the bec system",
    ". in particular , unusual behavior of sound propagation in an osl compared to the case in an ol at 1d has been found , i.e. the sound speed can first increase and then decrease as the lattice strength @xmath66 increases .",
    "such behavior can be understood using our analytical results for weak lattices . as a consequence ,",
    "an experimentalist can , in principle , engineer the rich behavior of the sound speed by altering osl s parameters , which can find the direct applications for manipulating system bath coupling in driven open system with atoms .",
