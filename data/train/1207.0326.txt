    "bose - einstein condensation is a very general physical phenomenon which takes place in the systems of bosonic atoms at ultralow temperatures , as well as in optical wave systems @xcite .",
    "it appears in the fields of condensed matter , atomic and elementary particle physics and astrophysics @xcite .",
    "the majority of important features of the condensation in such diverse systems can be captured by the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation , which is a variant of the nonlinear schrdinger equation with a trap potential . due to the nonlinearities arising from the interatomic interactions and due to the presence of a confining potential in the gp equation",
    ", many studies have been performed either by solving the corresponding gp equation numerically or by using perturbative methods ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however the construction of exact solutions of the gp equation can help to advance our understanding of the various physical phenomena governed by this nonlinear equation .",
    "for instance , the exact analytical solutions can contribute to select the experimental parameters , to analyze the stability of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) and to check numerical analysis of this nonlinear equation @xcite .",
    "therefore , the construction of the exact solution of the gp equation is one of the most relevant challenges to take up . to this end",
    ", many works have proposed several methods to exactly solve the gp equation , such as the darboux transformation method , the hyperbolic - function method , the elliptic - functions method , the inverse - scattering method , the generalized @xmath0-expansion method , the hirota bilinear method , the painlev analysis , the lie symmetry , the tanh - function method and the extended tanh - function method ( see for instance @xcite and references therein )",
    ". finding the nontrivial seed solutions that mimics the sought solutions of the gp equation always remains a hard task .",
    "recently , there have been some experimental reports on solitons in the quasi one - dimensional ( 1d ) system which have been observed by magnetically tuning the interparticle interaction from repulsive to attractive .",
    "experimentally , for the realization of 1d systems , one should make the radial frequency much larger than the axial frequency and strongly confine the radial motion .",
    "the state in this cylindrical harmonic - oscillator trap represents a nonlinear matter wave .    the formation and propagation of matter waves , such as dark solitons , bright solitons , four - wave mixing and moving or stationary gap solitons @xcite are among the most interesting dynamical features in bose - einstein condensation",
    "of course , such dynamics depends on the types of interactions in which the system is subjected to . for atoms in the nk - mk temperature regime , the effect of the earth s gravitational field is by no means negligible especially in the case of magnetic trapping .",
    "the gravitational field plays a subtle role in the topological formation of stable vortices within the field reverse time in bec experiments with heavier atoms like @xmath1rb @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the gravitational field can change the propagation trail of the bright soliton trains without changing the peak and width of the soliton in the parabolic background @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the presence of a homogeneous gravitational field can decrease the condensation temperature of bose gases @xcite .",
    "becs also appear in the astrophysical context .",
    "for example , one has recently argued that dark matter @xcite , an unknown component which corresponds to approximately 25 % of the energy content of the universe , is currently under the form of a bec @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "bosonic dark matter particles underwent a phase transition forming a bec at some point during the evolution of the universe . as a consequence ,",
    "one opens the possibility of admitting the existence of becs subjected to many gravitational effects .",
    "this seems to be a very promising line of research for the next years .    in this paper",
    ", we study the dynamics of becs in a magnetic trap in the presence of gravity .",
    "we construct an exact solution of the gp equation which has as special cases the well - known bright and dark solitons .",
    "the work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we present the model . then in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , by utilizing the extended tanh - function method , we find the various soliton solutions . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] we examine the dynamical properties of these solutions . finally in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] , we summarize our results and conclude the work . +",
    "as is well known , in the mean field approximation , the full dynamics of a bec in a trap potential @xmath2 satisfies the time - dependent gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 , with @xmath5 being the atomic mass and @xmath6 the _ s_-wave scattering length which can be either _ positive _ ( the case of @xmath1rb atoms with @xmath7 nm and then repulsive interactions)@xcite or _ negative _ ( the case of @xmath8li atoms with @xmath9 nm and then attractive interactions ) @xcite . it has been shown that , for alkali atoms at least , the effect of gravity is non - negligible @xcite .",
    "we recall that in the usual experimental traps , the atomic clouds are confined with the help of laser or magnetic trapping . for alkali atoms such as rubidium , which is the most used boson for experiments on cold atoms ,",
    "most of the existing traps can be well approximated by a three - dimensional harmonic oscillator @xcite .",
    "we consider a trapped bose gas of non - relativistic particles immersed in a newtonian gravitational field . in this case",
    ", the external confining potential must take into account the contribution of both the magnetic trapping field and the gravitational field .",
    "it is given by the sum of the quadratic and gravitational potentials generated by these respective fields @xcite : @xmath10 where @xmath11 , with @xmath12 , denote the frequencies of the harmonic oscillator along the coordinate axes .",
    "the parameter @xmath13 , which represents the acceleration of gravity , is taken as constant since the gravitational field is homogeneous . the gravitational potential represented by the last term of eq .",
    "( [ eq00a ] ) is also present in the case of the tilted trap @xcite .    in general , the harmonic - oscillator potential represented by the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq00a ] ) is anisotropic , i.e. , the trapping frequencies @xmath11 are all different . for a trap that is axially symmetric along the @xmath14- axis , we have @xmath15 . in such a case",
    ", @xmath16 is referred to as the longitudinal frequency ( along the axial direction ) while @xmath17 is the radial frequency of the anisotropic harmonic trap .",
    "( [ eq00 ] ) reduces to the following three - dimensional gp equation : @xmath18 \\psi + g_{0 } |\\psi|^{2 } \\psi , \\label{eq02}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the radial distance .",
    "the radial motion can be strongly confined by making the radial frequency much larger than the axial frequency , i.e. @xmath20 . in this case",
    "the condensate is cigar - shaped , and owing to that @xcite , one can take @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the ground state of the radial problem , with @xmath23 . then multiplying both sides of the gp equation ( [ eq02 ] ) by @xmath24 and integrating over the transverse variable @xmath25 we obtain a quasi - one - dimensional gp equation in the form : @xmath26 .",
    "the @xmath27-wave scattering length @xmath6 can be managed through the feshbach resonance technique @xcite .",
    "additionally , the effect of the acceleration of gravity @xmath13 in the bec experiment can be tiny varied or even cancelled in drop tower experiments @xcite . in the astrophysical context , we know that bec might exist ( in a speculative scenario ) and can be subjected to very high gravitational fields ( close to black holes , for example ) .",
    "this suggests the possibility to vary the gravitational field .",
    "hence one has some freedom in choosing the physical parameters of the system . in what follows , we set @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 .",
    "we follow the ideas of refs . @xcite and seek the exact solitonic solutions of eq .",

    "in fact , the bias magnetic field may be the analog of gravitational field since both fields are represented by the linear term in the trapping potential . from the results of @xcite , we infer that the kink solitons created in a bias magnetic field alone behave like a classical particle in a pure free fall motion led by the `` gravity '' in the @xmath168 space . in the present case ,",
    "the gravitational field is not alone .",
    "the presence of the parabolic magnetic potential changes the effect of the gravitational field .",
    "for instance , when the initial speed of the bright or dark soliton is zero , then both the velocity and the acceleration at any time are zero too .",
    "the present study suggests three ways to generate bright and dark solitons in bec systems by time - varying the _ s_-wave scattering length ( through the feshbach resonance ) without changing the magnetic potential .",
    "this can be done by tuning the scattering length to @xmath169 when the condensate is confined in an attractive magnetic trap , i.e. @xmath48 is positive .",
    "we may also tune the scattering length to @xmath170 , or @xmath171 , in the case of expulsive magnetic trap , i.e. @xmath48 is negative .",
    "in conclusion , we have considered the gp equation with time - dependent cubic nonlinearity which describes the dynamics of the bec matter - waves in a magnetic field and under the effect of a homogeneous gravitational field . with the help of the extended tanh - function method",
    ", we have obtained a solution which has as special cases the bright and dark solitons .",
    "as has been discussed , these solitons can be generated by properly tuning the _ s_-wave scattering length of the condensed particles , depending on whether the magnetic trapping is attractive or expulsive .",
    "the dynamics and kinematics of these matter waves have been presented and discussed .",
    "we have found that the gravity reshapes the repel force of the magnetic trap , and then drives the matter waves towards the region around the position @xmath167 .",
    "the matter waves may remain in that position for scattering lengths @xmath170 or @xmath171 , and may oscillate around it for @xmath169 . by comparing the results obtained here with those of @xcite , we have found that the role of gravitational field depends on the type of trap in which the condensate is confined .",
    "the study of the dynamics and stability of a bec under the effect of very strong gravitational field , that could occur ( in a speculative way ) for instance close to black holes , appears to pose an interesting issue to investigate in future works .",
