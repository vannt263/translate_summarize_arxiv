    "measurements of rates for single - inclusive @xmath1 annihilation ( sia ) into a specific hadron @xmath2 , @xmath3 play a similarly fundamental role as those of the corresponding crossed ` space - like ' deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) process @xmath4 .",
    "their interpretation in terms of scale - dependent fragmentation functions @xmath5 , the ` time - like ' counterparts of the parton distribution functions @xmath6 of a hadron @xmath2 , hence provides a further important , complementary test of perturbative qcd .",
    "the production of @xmath0 baryons appears to be particularly interesting , also from a different point of view .",
    "contrary to spinless mesons like pions and kaons , the @xmath0 baryon offers the rather unique possibility to study for the first time spin transfer reactions .",
    "the self - analyzing properties of its dominant weak decay @xmath7 and the particularly large asymmetry of the angular distribution of the decay proton in the @xmath0 rest - frame allow for an experimental reconstruction of the @xmath0 spin .",
    "such studies of @xmath0 polarization could provide a completely new insight into the field of spin physics whose theoretical understanding is still far from being complete despite of recent progress , and they might also yield further information on the hadronization mechanism .    in @xcite",
    "a strategy was proposed for extracting in @xmath1 annihilation the functions @xmath8 describing the fragmentation of a longitudinally polarized parton into a longitudinally polarized @xmath0  @xcite . at high energies , such as at lep ,",
    "even _ no _ beam polarization is required since the parity - violating @xmath9 coupling automatically generates a net polarization of the quarks . here ,",
    "aleph @xcite , delphi @xcite and opal @xcite have recently reported first results for the polarization of @xmath0 s produced on the ` @xmath10-resonance ' .    on the other hand , after the scheduled upgrade of the hera electron ring with spin rotators in front of the h1 and zeus experiments , longitudinally polarized electrons will be also available for high - energy @xmath11 collisions , and semi - inclusive dis ( sidis ) or photoproduction measurements with polarized @xmath0 s in the final state could be carried out .",
    "furthermore , having also a polarized proton beam available at hera would allow the measurement of various different twist-2 asymmetries depending on whether the @xmath12 and/or the @xmath13 beam and/or the @xmath0 are polarized , i.e. , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 ( as usual , an arrow denotes a polarized particle ) .",
    "so far estimates for future @xmath0 experiments have relied on simple models  @xcite or on monte - carlo simulations tuned with several parameters and parametrizations of scale-_in_dependent spin - transfer coefficients @xmath17 which link longitudinally polarized and unpolarized fragmentation functions via @xcite @xmath18 of course , such relations can not in general hold true in qcd . due to the different @xmath19-evolutions of @xmath20 and",
    "@xmath21 the assumed scale independence of @xmath17 in ( [ eq : ctrans ] ) can not be maintained at different values of @xmath19 , and therefore one has to specify a scale at which one implements such an ansatz .    in the following",
    "we will address the issue of fragmentation into polarized @xmath0 s within a detailed qcd analysis . here",
    "it will be possible for us to work even at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) accuracy , as the required spin - dependent ` time - like ' two - loop evolution kernels were derived recently @xcite .",
    "for the first time , we will provide some realistic sets of unpolarized and polarized fragmentation functions for @xmath0 baryons .",
    "since there are hardly any data sensitive to the polarized fragmentation functions @xmath20 , one has to rely on reasonable assumptions . a useful constraint when constructing models",
    "is provided by the positivity condition ( similarly to the ` space - like ' case ) , i.e. @xmath22 the unpolarized @xmath23 will be taken from an analysis of the unpolarized case where several different and rather precise measurements already exist @xcite .",
    "of course , it will turn out that the available sparse data from lep @xcite are by far not sufficient to completely pin down the @xmath8 .",
    "our various proposed sets for @xmath20 , which are all compatible with the lep data @xcite , are particularly suited for estimating the physics potential of hera to determine the polarized fragmentation functions more precisely .",
    "we hence present detailed predictions for future sidis and photoproduction measurements at hera using our @xmath20 .",
    "the remainder of this contribution is organized as follows : in the next section we briefly sketch the required formalism for unpolarized sia and discuss our analysis of unpolarized leading order ( lo ) and nlo @xmath0 fragmentation functions . in section 3",
    "we turn to the case of longitudinally polarized @xmath0 production and present our different conceivable scenarios for the @xmath20 . in section 4",
    "we analyze in detail possible sidis and photoproduction measurements at hera as a way to further discriminate between the different proposed sets of polarized fragmentation functions .",
    "finally our results are summarized in section 5 .",
    "further details of our analysis will be published in @xcite .",
    "the cross section for the inclusive production of a hadron with energy @xmath24 in sia at a c.m.s .",
    "energy @xmath25 , integrated over the production angle , can be written in the following way  @xcite : @xmath26 \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath27 ( @xmath28 being the momentum of the intermediate boson , @xmath29 ) and @xmath30 is the the total cross section for @xmath31 .",
    "the sum in ( [ eq : cross ] ) , runs over the @xmath32 active quark flavours @xmath33 , and the @xmath34 are the corresponding appropriate electroweak charges .",

    "the corresponding nlo expressions for @xmath39 and @xmath40 which include the relevant nlo coefficient functions are too lengthy to be given here but can be found in @xcite .",
    "needless to say that when going to nlo , the @xmath19-evolution of the @xmath41 also has to be performed to nlo accuracy .",
    "the unpolarized two - loop ` time - like ' splitting functions required here have been published in @xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned that our nlo distributions refer to the @xmath42 scheme .    in the last few years several experiments",
    "@xcite have reported measurements of the unpolarized cross section for the production of @xmath0 baryons , which allows an extraction of the unpolarized @xmath0 fragmentation functions required for constructing the polarization asymmetries and as reference distributions in the positivity constraint ( [ eq : positivity ] ) .",
    "we emphasize at this point that the wide range of c.m.s .",
    "energies covered by the data @xcite ( @xmath43 gev ) makes a detailed qcd analysis that includes the @xmath19-evolution of the fragmentation functions mandatory . as pointed out in  @xcite , the qcd formalism is strictly speaking only applicable to strongly produced @xmath44 .",
    "a certain fraction of the data  @xcite will , however , consist of secondary @xmath0 s resulting from @xmath45 with the subsequent decay @xmath46 , not to be included in the fragmentation functions @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", we will ignore this problem and ( successfully ) attempt to describe the full data samples by fragmentation functions that are evolved according to the qcd @xmath19-evolution equations .    unless stated otherwise",
    ", we will refer to both @xmath47 and @xmath48 , which are not usually distinguished in present @xmath1 experiments @xcite , as simply ` @xmath0 ' . as a result",
    ", the obtained fragmentation functions always correspond to the sum @xmath49 this also considerably simplifies the analysis , since no distinction between ` favored ' and ` unfavored ' distributions is required . since no precise sidis data are available yet , it is not possible to obtain individual distributions for all the light flavours separately , and hence some sensible assumptions concerning them have to be made . employing naive quark model @xmath50 arguments and neglecting any mass differences between @xmath51 ,",
    "we _ assume _ ] that all the light flavours fragment equally into @xmath0 , i.e. @xmath52 needless to say that the @xmath33 and @xmath53 fragmentation functions in ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) are equal due to eq .",
    "( [ eq : lamlambar ] ) .    for our analysis , we choose to work in the framework of the radiative parton model which is characterized by a rather low starting scale @xmath54 for the @xmath19-evolutions .",
    "the radiative parton model has proven phenomenologically successful in the ` space - like ' case for both unpolarized  @xcite and polarized  @xcite parton densities , and also in the ` time - like ' situation for photon fragmentation functions  @xcite .    at the initial scale ( @xmath55 , @xmath56 )",
    "we choose the following simple ansatz : @xmath57 where @xmath58 , and @xmath59 . for details on the treatment of the heavy flavour contributions ,",
    "i.e.  by @xmath60 and @xmath61 quarks , which are of minor importance in our analysis , we refer to @xcite . utilizing eq .",
    "( [ eq : ansatz ] ) a total of 10 free parameters remains to be fixed from a fit to the available 103 data points @xcite ( as usual , see , e.g. @xcite for a recent analysis of pion and kaon data , we include only data with @xmath62 in our fit to avoid possibly large non - perturbative contributions induced by finite - mass corrections ) .",
    "the total @xmath63 values are 103.55 and 104.29 in nlo and lo , respectively , and the optimal parameters in ( [ eq : input ] ) can be found in  @xcite .    a comparison of our lo and nlo results with the data is presented in fig .  1 , where all the existing data @xcite have been converted to the ` format ' of eq.([eq : cross ] ) .",
    "one should note that the lo and the nlo results are almost indistinguishable , demonstrating the perturbative stability of the process considered .",
    "furthermore , there is an excellent agreement between the predictions of our fits and the data even in the small-@xmath64 region which has not been included in our analysis .",
    "having obtained a reliable set of unpolarized fragmentation functions we now turn to the polarized case where unfortunately only scarce and far less precise data are available .",
    "in fact , no data at all have been obtained so far using polarized beams .",
    "the only available information comes from _",
    "un_polarized lep measurements @xcite profitting from the parity - violating electroweak @xmath9 coupling .    for such measurements , done at the mass of the @xmath10 boson ( ` @xmath10-resonance ' ) , the cross section for the production of polarized hadrons can be written as @xcite @xmath65 \\ ; .\\ ] ] if , as for the quoted experimental results  @xcite , the cross section is integrated over the angle @xmath66 , the anyway small contribution from @xmath67 vanishes .",
    "one can then define the asymmetry @xmath68 which corresponds to the ` @xmath0-polarization ' observable measured at lep .",
    "the polarized _ non_-singlet structure function @xmath69 is given at lo by @xmath70\\;\\;\\;,\\ ] ] where the @xmath71 are the appropriate effective charges ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the complete nlo qcd corrections can be found in @xcite .",
    "note that only the _ valence _ part of the polarized fragmentation functions can be obtained from the available lep data  @xcite , and that @xmath47 s and @xmath48 s give contributions of opposite signs to the measured polarization and thus to @xmath72 .",
    "unfortunately , it turns out that with the available lep data  @xcite , all obtained on the @xmath10-resonance , it is not even possible to obtain the valence distributions for all the flavours , so some assumptions have to be made here .",
    "obviously , even further assumptions are needed for the polarized gluon and sea fragmentation functions in order to have a complete set of fragmentation functions suitable for predictions for other processes , in particular for those relevant for hera .",
    "the heavy flavour contributions to polarized @xmath0 production are neglected , and @xmath73 and @xmath74 fragmentation functions are taken to be equal in this analysis . furthermore , polarized unfavored distributions , i.e. @xmath75 , etc . , and the gluon fragmentation function @xmath76",
    "are assumed to be negligible at the initial scale @xmath54 , an assumption which of course might deserve a further scrutiny in the future .",
    "the remaining fragmentation functions are parametrized in the following simple way @xmath77 and are subject to the positivity constraints ( [ eq : positivity ] ) .",
    "these input distributions are then evolved to higher @xmath19 via the appropriate altarelli - parisi equations . for the nlo evolution",
    "one has to use for this purpose the spin - dependent ` time - like ' two - loop splitting functions as derived in  @xcite in the @xmath42 scheme .    within this framework",
    "we try three different scenarios for the polarized fragmentation functions at our low initial scale @xmath54 to cover a rather wide range of plausible models :    * scenario 1 * corresponds to the expectations from the non - relativistic naive quark model where only @xmath78-quarks can contribute to the fragmentation processes that eventually yield a polarized @xmath0 , even if the @xmath0 is formed via the decay of a heavier hyperon .",
    "we hence have @xmath79 in ( [ eq : polinput ] ) for this case .",
    "* scenario 2 * is based on estimates by burkardt and jaffe @xcite for the dis structure function @xmath80 of the @xmath0 , predicting sizeable negative contributions from @xmath73 and @xmath74 quarks to @xmath80 by analogy with the breaking of the gourdin - ellis - jaffe sum rule @xcite for the proton s @xmath81 . assuming that such features also carry over to the ` time - like ' case @xcite",
    ", we simply impose @xmath82 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "* scenario 3 : * all the polarized fragmentation functions are assumed to be equal here , i.e. @xmath83 , contrary to the expectation of the non - relativistic quark model used in scen .  1 .",
    "this rather ` extreme ' scenario might be realistic if , e.g. , there are sizeable contributions to polarized @xmath0 production from decays of heavier hyperons who have inherited the polarization of originally produced @xmath73 and @xmath74 quarks .    our results for the asymmetry @xmath84 in ( [ eq : lepasym ] ) within the three different scenarios are compared to the available lep data  @xcite in fig .  2 . the optimal parameters in ( [ eq : polinput ] ) for the three models can be found in @xcite .",
    "as can be seen , the best agreement with the data is obtained within the ( naively ) most unlikely scen .",
    "the differences occur mainly in the region of large @xmath64 , where scen .",
    "1 and 2 can not fully account for the rather large observed polarization due to the positivity constraints ( [ eq : positivity ] ) .",
    "for instance , in the case of scen .  1 , the asymmetry behaves asymptotically roughly like @xmath85 , and even when saturating the positivity constraint ( [ eq : positivity ] ) at around @xmath86 it is not possible to obtain a polarization as large as the one required by the lep data .",
    "of course , such an argument still depends strongly on the assumed @xmath87 symmetry for the _ un_polarized fragmentation functions , which could be broken .",
    "the situation concerning the @xmath0 fragmentation functions can only be further clarified by future precise sidis and photoproduction measurements for unpolarized _ and _ polarized beams .    finally , in fig .",
    "3 we show the lo and nlo partonic fragmentation asymmetries for each flavour distribution separately , i.e. , @xmath88 . a rather large polarized gluon fragmentation function has built up in the @xmath19-evolution in spite of the vanishing input at @xmath89 .",
    "equipped with various sets of polarized fragmentation functions , let us now turn to other processes that might further probe our distributions .    the sidis process @xmath90 is also very well suited to give information on fragmentation functions . in this case , the cross section is proportional to a combination of both the parton distributions of the nucleon @xmath91 and the fragmentation functions for the hadron @xmath2 .",
    "the latter thus automatically appear in a constellation different from the one probed in @xmath92 annihilation .    in this work",
    ", we will only refer to the current fragmentation region by implementing a cut @xmath93 on the feynman - variable .",
    "target fragmentation can be accounted for by the introduction of ` fracture functions ' @xcite , but is beyond the scope of this analysis @xcite .    in the particular case",
    "where both nucleon and hadron are unpolarized , the cross section can be written in a way similar to the fully inclusive dis case : @xmath94\\ ] ] with the structure function @xmath95 given at lo by @xmath96 the corresponding nlo corrections can be found in @xcite . as already mentioned in the introduction",
    ", three other possible cross sections can be defined when the polarization of the lepton , the initial nucleon and the hadron are taken into account . if both nucleon and hadron are polarized and the lepton is unpolarized , the expression is similar to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sidis]),([eq : nopol ] ) above with , however , the unpolarized parton distributions _ and _ the fragmentation functions to be replaced by their polarized counterparts . in the case that the lepton and either the nucleon or the hadron are polarized , the expression for the cross section is given as in the fully inclusive case by a single structure function @xmath97 : @xmath98   \\ ; .\\ ] ] here the polarized structure function @xmath99 can be written as @xcite @xmath100 the position of the @xmath101 depending on which particle is polarized .",
    "the corresponding nlo corrections for the various polarized cross sections can be found in @xcite .",
    "the most interesting observable at hera with respect to the determination of the polarized @xmath0 fragmentation functions is of course the asymmetry for the production of _ polarized _",
    "s from an unpolarized proton , defined by @xmath102 @xcite .",
    "such a measurement would be particularly suited to improve the information on polarized fragmentation functions . in fig .",
    "4a ) , we show our lo and nlo predictions for hera with polarized electrons and _ un_polarized protons using the grv parton distributions @xcite , integrated over the measurable range @xmath103 .",
    "the values for @xmath19 that correspond to each @xmath104 have been chosen as in @xcite .",
    "good perturbative stability of the process is found .",
    "as can be seen , the results obtained using the three distinct scenarios for polarized fragmentation functions turn out to be completely different . since the asymmetry at small @xmath104",
    "is determined by the proton s sea quarks , its behaviour can be easily understood : in scen .",
    "1 only @xmath78 quarks fragment to polarized @xmath0 s , giving an asymmetry which is positive but about three times smaller than the one of scen .  3 where all the flavours contribute .",
    "in the case of scen .",
    "2 the positive contribution from @xmath78-quark fragmentation is cancelled by a negative one from @xmath73 and @xmath74 , resulting in an almost vanishing asymmetry . the interpretation is similar for the region of large @xmath104 , where only the contribution involving @xmath105 is sizeable and the asymmetry asymptotically goes to @xmath106 for each scenario .",
    "we have included in fig .",
    "4a ) also the expected statistical errors for hera , computed assuming an integrated luminosity of @xmath107 pb@xmath108 and a realistic value of @xmath109 for the efficiency of @xmath0 detection @xcite .",
    "comparing the asymmetries and the error bars in fig .",
    "4a ) one concludes that a measurement of @xmath84 at small @xmath104 would allow a discrimination between different conceivable scenarios for polarized fragmentation functions .",
    "4b ) shows our results vs.  @xmath110 for fixed @xmath111 .",
    "again , very different asymmetries are found for the three scenarios .",
    "the particular case of both target and hadron being polarized was originally proposed as a very good way to obtain the @xmath112 distribution  @xcite .",
    "the underlying assumption here was that only the fragmentation function @xmath113 is sizeable ( as realized , e.g. in our scenario 1 ) , and that therefore the only contribution to the polarized cross section has to be proportional to @xmath114 . in order to analyse the sensitivity of the corresponding asymmetry to @xmath112 , we compute it using the two different grsv sets of polarized parton densities of the proton @xcite , which mainly differ in the strange distribution : the so - called ` standard ' set assumes an unbroken @xmath87 symmetric sea , whereas in the ` valence ' scenario the sea is maximally broken and the resulting strange quark density quite small .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "5 . unfortunately  and not unexpectedly  it turns out that the differences in the asymmetry resulting from our different models for polarized @xmath0 fragmentation are far larger than the ones due to employing different polarized proton strange densities .",
    "in addition , a distinction between different @xmath112 would remain elusive even if the spin - dependent @xmath0 fragmentation functions were known to good accuracy , as can be seen from the error bars in fig .",
    "5 which were obtained using the same parameters as before .",
    "finally , let us examine the case of photoproduction of @xmath0 s at hera .",
    "we can be very brief here and refer the reader to the dedicated report on photoproduction for this workshop @xcite , where all details like , e.g. the polarized parton distributions of the photon and the kinematical cuts suitable for photoproduction , are discussed .    here",
    "it appears very promising to study the @xmath115-distribution of the photoproduction cross section for @xmath0 s and the corresponding asymmetry , where @xmath115 is the laboratory frame rapidity defined to be positive in the proton forward direction .",
    "6 shows our results for such a calculation where we have integrated over @xmath116 . to calculate the resolved photon contribution to the cross section we have used two conceivable , extreme scenarios for the experimentally completely unknown parton distributions of a longitudinally polarized photon @xmath117 ( see @xcite for details ) . as can be inferred from fig .",
    "6 there is a strong sensitivity to our proposed different scenarios for the @xmath20 , but a comparison of the upper and lower parts of fig .",
    "6 , which have been calculated for different assumptions for the resolved contribution , also reveals that our ignorance concerning the @xmath117 sets a potential limitation to an extraction of the fragmentation functions .",
    "the @xmath117 can of course be further constrained in other conceivable photoproduction measurements in polarized @xmath11 collisions at hera like dijet production @xcite .",
    "finally it should be stressed that due to the small @xmath19 , photoproduction benefits from larger rates , and hence reasonable measurements can be performed at even rather low luminosities of about @xmath118 .",
    "we have analyzed hera s capability of pinning down the spin - dependent fragmentation functions for @xmath0 baryons via semi - inclusive deep - inelastic scattering or photoproduction of @xmath0 s .",
    "working within the framework of the radiative parton model , our starting point has been a fit to unpolarized data for @xmath0 production taken in @xmath92 annihilation , yielding a set of realistic unpolarized fragmentation functions for the @xmath0 .",
    "we have then made simple assumptions for the relation between the spin - dependent and the unpolarized @xmath0 fragmentation functions at the input scale for the @xmath19 evolution .",
    "taking into account the sparse lep data on @xmath0 polarization , we were able to set up three distinct ` toy scenarios ' for the spin - dependent @xmath0 fragmentation functions .",
    "we emphasize that our proposed sets can by no means cover all the allowed possibilities for the polarized fragmentation functions , the main reason being that the lep data are only sensitive to the valence part of the polarized fragmentation functions .",
    "thus , there are still big uncertainties related to the ` unfavored ' quark and gluon fragmentation functions , making further measurements in other processes indispensable .    under these premises",
    ", we have considered @xmath0 production at hera , both in a situation with polarized electrons scattered of unpolarized protons and vice versa .",
    "it turns out that sidis measurements in the first case should be particularly well suited to yield further information on the @xmath119 : differences between the asymmetries obtained when using different sets of @xmath20 are usually larger than the expected statistical errors .",
    "in contrast to this , having a polarized proton beam does not appear beneficial in any way as far as @xmath0 production at hera is concerned .",
    "finally , we found that also photoproduction of @xmath0 s in scattering of polarized photons off the unpolarized proton beam at hera shows strong sensitivity to the @xmath20 , even though here the unknown contribution from resolved photons will set limitations to an extraction of the polarized fragmentation functions .",
    "the work of one of us ( ddf ) was partially supported by the world laboratory .",
