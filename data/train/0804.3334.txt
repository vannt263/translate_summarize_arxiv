    "since decades the so  called rosenbluth separation has been utilized to extract the electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon from the differential cross section for unpolarized electron nucleon scattering .",
    "more recently , polarization measurements have become available that provide additional information on these form factors .",
    "surprisingly , substantial inconsistencies between these two measurements of the same physical quantity seem to emerge .    to start discussing the problem we introduce the relevant lorentz invariant kinematical variables .",
    "first we have = = - [ eq : deftau ] where @xmath0 is the momentum transfer and @xmath1 the nucleon mass . for space  like processes , such as the elastic electron nucleon scattering , @xmath2 is non  negative .",
    "the second lorentz invariant variable is the photon polarization parameter = = ( k+k^)(p+p^ ) .",
    "[ eq : defeps ]    the leading ( tree level ) contribution to elastic electron nucleon scattering is shown as feynman diagram in figure  [ fig : leading ] . in this one  photon exchange ( or born ) approximation",
    "the unpolarized elastic electron nucleon scattering cross section is = ( ) _ mott [ eq : rbluth ] in the limit of vanishing electron mass , @xmath3 , which is well justified in the considered kinematical regime . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rbluth ] ) @xmath4 are the electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon to be further specified later .",
    "the rosenbluth separation to extract these form factors from data is to display the ratio of the measured cross section and the mott cross section at a given momentum transfer , _",
    "@xmath5 as function of @xmath6 .",
    "after multiplicating this function with @xmath7 , the intercept and slope yield @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .    however , since the relative contribution of @xmath9 to the cross section quickly decreases with growing momentum transfer , this type of analysis becomes increasingly difficult already at @xmath10 .",
    "yet the results of this separation have turned out consistent with the assumption that the ratio r(q^2)= , [ eq : ratio ] where @xmath11 is the proton magnetic moment , approximately equals unity  @xcite .",
    "more recently , it has become possible to directly extract this ratio from polarization observables  @xcite , thereby avoiding the potentially uncertain separation technique .",
    "most surprisingly , these direct measurements exhibited a linear fall r(q^2)1 - 0.13(q^2[gev]^2 - 0.04 ) [ eq : rpol ] indicating an eventual root at about @xmath12 .",
    "such a behavior was already suggested as early as 1973  @xcite within semi  empirical fits to existing data .",
    "more recently this structure has been predicted within a chiral soliton model study  @xcite . to resolve this puzzle ,",
    "the rosenbluth separation has been repeated with significantly improved precision  @xcite . for this technique to be operative ,",
    "it is important that the data are indeed consistent with this linear relation  @xcite .",
    "not only is this indeed the case but also the previous result @xmath13 is reproduced .",
    "hence we face the paradox situation that two distinct methods to experimentally determine a fundamental nucleon property yield inconsistent results  @xcite .",
    "a possible resolution could be that contributions to the cross section that stem from two  photon exchanges but have been omitted so far , are amplified with increasing @xmath14 . in turn , the rosenbluth separation yields modified form factors that significantly deviate from the ones that are defined via a one photon exchange  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "symmetry properties require that the two  photon exchange contributions alter the ( linear ) dependence on the photon polarization parameter @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "yet the data are consistent with but not restricted to this linear dependence  @xcite .",
    "it is widely believed  @xcite that the two  photon mainly effects the rosenbluth method but are negligibly small for the polarization process . we will therefore focus on the former .",
    "there are two types of two  photon exchange feynman diagrams that we display in figures  [ fig : box ] and  [ fig:2ph1 ] .",
    "the box diagrams in figure  [ fig : box ] are essentially iterations of the one  photon exchange shown in figure  [ fig : leading ] .",
    "any estimate of these box diagrams require additional information about the off  shell behavior of the photon ",
    "nucleon vertex .",
    "furthermore the intermediate baryon is not restricted to be the nucleon , it could be any nucleon resonance that possesses a sizable electro  production potential .",
    "many assumptions and modeling of baryon properties enter the computation of these diagrams  @xcite . for a recent review on both the experimental and the theoretical situations see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the second type of diagrams shown is in figure  [ fig:2ph1 ] and has the photon coupled to the nucleon at a single vertex .",
    "such diagrams are curious because they do not appear in simple dirac theories of the nucleon which are linear in the covariant derivative .",
    "nevertheless , such diagrams are not unknown in hadron physics .",
    "in particular , the @xmath15 decay induces such a vertex as shown in figure  [ fig : pion2ph ] . in that case the intrinsic structure of the @xmath16 vertex is dictated by the quark triangle diagram , _",
    "i.e. _  the axial anomaly .",
    "so we may imagine the nucleon coupling to an ( off  shell ) pion via a yukawa interaction and the pion subsequently decaying into an electron ",
    "positron pair as in figure  [ fig : pion2ph ] .",
    "as we will observe , this process is negligible since ( after renormalization ) this diagram turns out to vanish in the limit @xmath17 .",
    "the reason is that in the interaction lagrangian the two photons couple to the derivative of the pion field and , when computing the feynam diagram , an integration by parts produces a factor @xmath18 .",
    "hence the single pion exchange can not produce a significant contribution to electron proton scattering .",
    "however , in chiral model multiple pion exchanges cease to have derivative couplings to the two photons and are hence not necessarily suppressed when @xmath17 .",
    "the main purpose of the present investigation is to point out that this anomaly induced process has a considerable affect for two photon contributions in the rosenbluth analysis and that this process has not been considered previously .",
    "of course , this process by itself can not fully explain the discrepancy to the polarization analysis .",
    "the required anomaly contribution to the local process shown in figure  [ fig:2ph1 ] can be perfectly studied within chiral soliton models for baryons . in these models the chiral field @xmath19 not only is the non  linear representation of the pion field but also describes the nucleon as a ( topological ) soliton excitation . in these models",
    "we may understand the two  photon exchanges shown in figure  [ fig:2ph1 ] as the coupling of the nucleon s pion cloud to the electron through the anomaly .",
    "we will particularly compute the diagram in figure  [ fig:2ph1 ] within the skyrme model and focus on the anomaly contribution which is unique because it reflects a qcd property .",
    "diagrams that have two photons coupled to the nucleon at a single vertex are unique to chiral models because they are formulated in meson degrees of freedom .",
    "there are also non  anomalous local two  photon couplings .",
    "these are quite model dependent .",
    "therefore we will here only consider the one induced by the non ",
    "linear @xmath20 model as an example and observe that its contribution vanishes as @xmath17 .",
    "the soliton model successfully describes many properties of baryons and baryon resonances . though quantitatively the agreement with empirical data is on the @xmath21 , _",
    "i.e. _  30% , qualitative aspects are well explained , as has been recently reviewed in ref .",
    "this makes this model a perfect candidate to explore the above posed problem .",
    "the use of model calculations is the more unavoidable since in due time lattice calculations for ( off  shell ) two  photon form factors will not be available .",
    "furthermore we recall that in soliton models two  photon interactions have previously been successfully considered to compute static nucleon polarizabilities  @xcite .",
    "of course , the current problem goes beyond treating these interactions in a static framework .",
    "we consider the two  flavor skyrme model for baryons as the simplest of many models that support the soliton picture . in terms of the non  linear representation for the isovector pion field @xmath22",
    "u = exp , [ eq : defu ] where @xmath23 is the vector of pauli matrices , this model is defined by the lagrangian = ( _ u^u^ ) + ( ) + ( u+u^-2 ) . [ eq : skyrme ] the leading contribution is the non ",

    ", the skyrme term coupling @xmath26 may vary within a certain regime imposed by reproducing nucleon static properties reasonably well .    the hedgehog configuration that builds the soliton and carries unit baryon number reads u_0()=exp[eq : hedeghog ] where @xmath27 .",

    "we subsequently introduce collective coordinates @xmath31 u(,t)=a(t)u_0()a^(t ) [ eq : collcord ] that parameterize the spin  flavor orientation of the hedgehog and quantize them canonically .",
    "this turns the time variation of the collective coordinates into the spin operator , = ^2[u_0]tr , [ eq : spin ] where the moment of inertia , @xmath32 $ ] is a functional of the classical hedgehog field .",
    "its invariance under combined spin and isospin rotations yields the isospin operator as i_a =- d_abj_b d_ab = tr .",
    "[ eq : isospin ] in this relation @xmath33 refers to the adjoint representation @xmath33 of the collective rotations .",

    "[ eq : bwf ] here @xmath37 represents a nucleon state with spin and isospin projections @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "the identification of total spin and isospin originates from the hedgehog structure upon which rotations in coordinate and iso space are identical .    in practice",
    "we obtain operators for observables that are expressed in terms of the collective coordinates and their time derivatives .",
    "we use eqs  ( [ eq : spin ] ) and  ( [ eq : isospin ] ) to write the latter as operators in the space of the collective coordinates and sandwich them between the wavefunctions eq .",

    "0.2 cm    these features are quite different from the contributions of the box diagrams ( figure  [ fig : box ] ) that were estimated in ref .  @xcite outside of any soliton model .",
    "we stress that this is not a contradiction , rather the opposite is the case because these results must be added in a full computation of the two  photon effects onto the rosenbluth method .",

    "( [ eq : ima ] ) we argued that we set the renormalization scale @xmath57 and considered three cases @xmath137 that are suggested by the data for the decay @xmath117 .",
    "we display the corresponding variations for the cross section in figure  [ fig : delta ] .",
    "this uncertainty translates into an 1020% effect for the two  photon contribution to the cross section .",
    "these minor variations with the uncertainty in the fixing the model parameter from the underlying process @xmath45 is reassuring as it shows that the @xmath138 effects are not as severe as suspected .",
    "all results shown in figures  [ fig : f1f4 ] and  [ fig : f1f2 ] refer to the central value @xmath139 .",
    "we have also investigated the non  anomalous two  photon vertex that originates from the non ",
    "linear @xmath20model , eq .",
    "( [ eq : twogacoup ] ) . since this interaction does not have any derivative operator , the corresponding triangle diagram is ultra  violet finite and thus no counterterm is required .",
    "yet we find that the corresponding matrix element , @xmath140 vanishes as @xmath3 .",
    "hence this interaction gives negligible contribution within the rosenbluth method , if at all .",
    "we have performed a model calculation to shed some light on the discrepancies that arise from different methods to extract the nucleon electro  magnetic form factors from data .",
    "these discrepancies are assumed to be resolved by the inclusion of two  photon processes in the computation of electron ",
    "proton reactions .",
    "here we have focused on the contribution of such a process with the least model dependence and fewest assumptions about off  shell form factors .",
    "this appears to be the anomaly induced two  photon vertex because it actually is a qcd property .",
    "it naturally emerges from the nucleon pion cloud coupling to the qcd anomaly .",
    "this particular two  photon exchange contribution to the elastic electron nucleon scattering has previously been overlooked presumably because it vanishes in the one  pion exchange approximation .",
    "however there is no reason for it to be particularly small beyond that approximation . for these reasons we focus on this particular process , which of course does not fully explain the observed discrepancies by itself",
    "nevertheless , it is interesting to investigate this effect by its own as it has not been considered previously in the context of electron nucleon scattering .",
    "of course , there is no reason to assume that this piece by itself fully resolves the discrepancy between the rosenbluth and polarization analyses . at face value",
    "the corresponding feynman diagram is ultra  violet divergent and requires renormalization .",
    "we impose a renormalization condition that reproduces the empirical decay width for the process @xmath141 .",
    "this is an _",
    "ad hoc _ attempt to deal with the ( unknown ) off  shell behavior of the anomalous @xmath141 interaction that has been successfully utilized for the description of the pion decay .",
    "the skyrme soliton model is a perfect and the simplest tool to study this anomalous contribution to electron proton scattering because it provides both , the pion cloud picture of the nucleon and a unique description of the pion anomaly coupling via the wess  zumino term .",
    "we do not exclude that more sophisticated models might provide more reliable estimates of this effect .",
    "computed anomaly contribution to the unpolarized cross section has a minor effect on the cross section , of the order of a few per cent .",
    "this is to be anticipated for an order @xmath142 contamination . even though this contribution corrects the leading order result into the proper direction these corrections",
    "are not sufficient to fully explain the observed discrepancy . in this context",
    "we stress that this anomaly contribution must be considered in addition to contributions from the box diagrams in figure  [ fig : box ] .",
    "unfortunately , their computation is quite model dependent thereby leading to quite some uncertainties , in particular at large momentum transfers .",
    "eventually they can be reduced somewhat by phenomenological input for the generalized parton distributions from the amplitude of deeply virtual compton scattering  @xcite .",
    "the studies of ref .",
    "@xcite indicate that these box diagrams are the most significant for @xmath135 ( the two  photon piece in the unpolarized cross section ) at small @xmath6 .",
    "the anomaly contribution that we have computed enhances @xmath135 at moderate @xmath6 so that we expect a negative , say about 5% , effect at small and moderate @xmath6 while at the boundary @xmath132 the contributions of both , the anomaly and the box diagrams are compatible with zero .",
    "in general the model contains additional triangle diagram ( non  anomalous ) type two  photon processes like those shown in figure  [ fig:2ph1 ] where the two photons couple simultaneously to the pion cloud of the nucleon . in the present model it is natural to assume that the dominant such process stems from the non ",
    "linear @xmath20 model .",
    "we have seen that it vanishes as the momentum transfer is large compared to the electron mass .    in the next step",
    "we will have to investigate the anomaly contribution in the framework of the polarization method .",
