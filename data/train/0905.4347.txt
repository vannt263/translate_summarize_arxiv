    "the start - up of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) will scan a new range of energy and mass to solve the well known unanswered questions in particle physics ; especially concerned , two of them are flavor problem and electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the unification of these two problems is the major motivation to consider fourth family .",
    "in addition to the lhc , @xmath3 facility will also provide complementary information for new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) . the large hadron electron collider ( lhec )",
    "@xcite will consist of a new linear accelerator or a storage ring to collide electrons with energy of 70/140 gev with the existing 7 tev proton beam from the lhc .",
    "this will result in deep inelastic scattering interactions with a center of mass energy of 1.4/1.9 tev , and with a luminosity of up to @xmath4 @xmath5s@xmath6 , both significantly greater than the only previous electron - proton collider at hera .",
    "the lhec will also be expected to have sensitivity to new physics and new states of matter .",
    "it would give a possibility for polarized @xmath3 scattering to investigate the couplings of new fermions to the standard model ( sm ) fermions .",
    "it is well known that the sm does not predict the number of fermion families .",
    "the fermion family replicants remain a mystery of the flavor problem .",
    "the discovery of a sequential fourth family may play an important role in understanding the flavor structure of the sm .",
    "determination of the number of fermion families will be an important goal of the upcoming experiments at the lhc @xcite , and further at the ilc and clic @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the production of fourth family quarks via flavor changing neutral current interactions are investigated at future colliders @xcite .",
    "the experiments at tevatron have already constrained the masses of fourth family quarks .",
    "the collider detector at fermilab ( cdf ) has searched strong pair production of @xmath0 with its associated anti - quark , each decaying to a @xmath7 boson and a jet , with 2.8 @xmath8 of data run ii of tevatron setting a lower bound on mass of @xmath0 quark , @xmath9 gev at @xmath10 cl @xcite .",
    "there seems to be some parameter space ( mass vs. mixing angle ) of the fourth family quarks which could be explored at future searches @xcite .    in this study",
    ", we investigate the discovery potential of the lhec for the single production of sequential fourth family @xmath0 quarks via the process @xmath11 with the 70 gev electron and 7 tev proton beam energies .",
    "we have calculated the cross sections of signals and corresponding backgrounds .",
    "the decay widths and branching ratios of @xmath0 quark are calculated in the mass range 300 - 800 gev .",
    "all the calculations have been performed with comphep @xcite by including the new interaction vertices .",
    "the extension of the sm is simply to add a sequential fourth family fermions where left - handed components transform as a doublet of @xmath12 and right - handed components as singlets .",
    "the interaction of the fourth family @xmath0 quark with the quarks @xmath13 via the sm gauge bosons ( @xmath14 ) is given by    @xmath15    where @xmath16 , @xmath17 are the electro - weak coupling constants , and @xmath18 is the strong coupling constant .",

    ", we use the parametrization @xcite , @xmath31=0.063,@xmath32=0.46,@xmath33=0.47 , which were optimized for a @xmath34 deviation over the average values of the ckm matrix elements .",
