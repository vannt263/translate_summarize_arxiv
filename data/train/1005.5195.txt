    "concepts of entanglement for many - body quantum systems have recently proven useful to devise new methods for the numerical simulation of quantum spin chains .",
    "it has been shown that the very successful density matrix renormalization method ( dmrg )  @xcite can be rephrased as a variational method over the class of matrix product states ( mps )  @xcite ; this realization clarified the relatively poor performance of dmrg for systems with periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) , as mps with open boundary conditions ( obc ) do not have the right entanglement structure .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite how this could be cured by using a mps with pbc . however , due to the cyclic structure of the underlying mps , the computational cost of the simulation in terms of the mps bond dimension @xmath0 grew from @xmath10 to @xmath11 .",
    "this was subsequently lowered to @xmath10 in  @xcite .",
    "an important motivation to study finite chains is that one can compute bulk properties of the system in the thermodynamic limit by extrapolating results obtained for increasingly large chains @xcite . in this context",
    ", it is relevant whether obc or pbc are considered . for a finite chain with obc ,",
    "local expectation values differ from those in thermodynamic limit due both to finite - size effects and to boundary effects , and larger chains need to be considered . in contrast , with pbc only finite - size effects are present .",
    "this makes the extrapolation to the thermodynamic more transparent and smaller systems need to be simulated .",
    "another important advantage of pbc is that only in this case a finite chain can be translation invariant ( ti ) .",
    "is infinite from the start , there can not be finite - size or boundary corrections to the bulk properties of the system .",
    "however , in this case numerical results are contaminated by effects due to the finite bound dimension @xmath0 of the mps .",
    "interestingly , one can apply `` finite - d '' scaling techniques to extract accurate estimates of bulk properties  @xcite .",
    "] this is crucial feature for the present work , where ti is exploited in order to reduce the computational costs of simulating finite chains .",
    "pippan , white and evertz  @xcite recently showed how to simulate spin chains with pbc with an mps algorithm whose computational cost given in terms of @xmath0 scales like @xmath10 . the intuition behind this scaling can be understood if one first considers systems with a correlation length @xmath2 that is much shorter than the system size @xmath1 .",
    "let us choose a block of sites with size @xmath12 such that @xmath13 ( see figure  [ fig : xi_effect_on_pbc_chains]a ) . in this case correlations between the left and the right ends of the block",
    "are mediated only through the sites inside the block .",
    "it is clear that the properties of this block are exactly the same as those of a block of equal length embeded in the bulk of a sufficiently large system with obc .",
    "it is then not surprising that computing observables that are contained within the block has a cost proportional to @xmath6 , as in the case of obc .",
    "this is basically due to the fact that such calculations involve contracting a tensor network that has , as _ uncorrelated _ left and right boundary conditions , two _ boundary vectors _ with @xmath14 components @xcite .",
    "now imagine we are interested in the description of properties contained in a larger block such that @xmath15 ( see figure  [ fig : xi_effect_on_pbc_chains]b ) .",
    "this block is small enough for its ends to have correlations that are mediated via its own sites , yet large enough that correlations are also mediated via the sites outside the block , since now @xmath16 . if these externally mediated correlations are relatively small , the situation is not very different from the previously described case where @xmath17 .",
    "all we have to do is to replace the two uncorrelated _ boundary vectors _ with a low rank _ boundary matrix _ that contains the small amount of correlations .",
    "if the rank of the matrix is @xmath18 , then the cost of this algorithm will be proportional to @xmath19 .",
    "we emphasize two important aspects of the computational cost of the algorithm in ref .",
    "the _ first _",
    "one is that the cost is also proportional to the system size @xmath1 , due to the usual sweeping procedure that optimizes one site at each instant .",
    "we will show below how , in the case of a ti chain , one can get rid of this factor .",
    "the cost will not depend on @xmath1 at all .",
    "if @xmath20 on the other hand the cost will contain a factor that is smaller @xmath1 but is nevertheless an artifact thereof .",
    "] this is achieved by using a ti mps , where the @xmath1 tensors of the mps are chosen to be identical . for all @xmath0 ,",
    "the precision of our results is comparable to that reported in ref .",
    "this indicates that restricting the mps ansatz to be ti does not lead to a loss of precision , while yielding a substantial reduction of the computational cost .",
    "second _ one is the multiplicative factor @xmath18 corresponding to the rank of the boundary matrix that transfers correlations between the ends of a block . in the case where the correlation length @xmath2 is of the order of the system size @xmath1 ( see figure  [ fig : xi_effect_on_pbc_chains]c ) , this factor may not be small . in a worst case scenario , where strong correlations between distant sites would force the boundary matrix to be full rank , i.e. @xmath21 , the approach in ref .",
    "@xcite would not be better than the @xmath11 algorithm of ref .",
    "thus for critical systems where @xmath20 it is a priori unclear what the overall scaling of the computational cost in @xmath0 will be . however , in ref .  @xcite it has been indicated that if @xmath0 is not too large , the ground state energy of a critical spin chain obtained using a small constant @xmath18 is satisfactory , in that its accuracy scales with @xmath0 in a similar way as it would in an obc chain of the same size .",
    "here we shall show how to exploit ti to obtain a faster algorithm that , for instance , does not scale with @xmath1 when @xmath5 .",
    "however , except for the case @xmath22 , we still lack a precise characterization of how the cost scales as a function of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we benchmark the present approach by addressing both critical ( i.e. @xmath20 ) and non - critical ( i.e. @xmath22 ) chains .",
    "an important observation is that in the case of critical systems the finite bond dimension @xmath0 of the mps introduces an effective correlation length @xmath23 @xcite that depending on @xmath0 can be much smaller than the actual one .",
    "this implies that as @xmath1 grows , a larger bond dimension @xmath24 needs to be considered if correlations between distant sites of the chain with pbc are to be properly captured our numerical results are consistent with a complex scenario where the cost of simulations is dominated by the crossover between finite-@xmath1 and finite-@xmath0 corrections , as further discussed in  @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is structured as follows : we start by sketching the main idea of the approach in sect . [",
    "sec : overview ] , followed by an in - depth presentation of the algorithm in sect .",
    "[ sec : algorithm ] . in sect .",
    "[ sec : numerical_results ] we present numerical results for the critical quantum ising and heisenberg spin-@xmath7 models as well as for the non - critical heisenberg spin-@xmath8 model .",
    "finally sect .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] contains some conclusions .",
    "this work is concerned with the approximation of ground states ( gs ) within the variational class of mps with pbc defined in  @xcite .",
    "since critical systems are arguably among the most challenging ones from a computational perspective , we will apply the approach to investigate critical spin chains ( although non - critical chains can also be considered ) .",
    "an important restriction is that we only consider ti systems , which we will analyse with a ti mps ansatz , namely an mps where the tensors corresponding to different sites are all equal .",
    "the resulting variational class is a subclass of the one defined in @xcite .",
    "the ti mps with pbc reads @xmath25 with identical matrices @xmath26 at every site .",
    "note that since for fixed @xmath27 , each @xmath26 represents a matrix , the mps is completely characterized by the three dimensional tensor @xmath28 .",
    "furthermore we should point out that we will mostly be interested in hamiltonians that are real and reflection invariant ; these symmetries can be implemented at the level of mps by choosing the matrices @xmath26 real and symmetric . this extra constraint does not seem to deteriorate the accuracy of the variational procedure .",
    "since our ansatz consists of @xmath1 copies of the same tensor , the energy is not a quadratic expression in the variables defined by the tensors @xmath26 ; this implies that we can not use the sweeping procedure described in  @xcite or any other procedure that lowers the energy by minimizing it for one site at a time .",
    "while this might seem a reason to be concerned at first , it will actually be the key to reducing computational costs .",
    "the advantages of a ti mps ansatz ( with periodicity one or two ) have already been exploited in the context of infinitely long chains  @xcite .",
    "@xcite used a ti mps in the context of infinite system dmrg . in ref .",
    "@xcite , instead , a ( two - site periodic ) mps approximation to ground states was obtained by imaginary time evolution . refs .  @xcite discussed how to compute ground states with a one - site ti mps when the imaginary time evolution operator can be well enough approximated by layers of one - site ti matrix product operators .",
    "an attempt to adapt that method to finite chains with pbc yielded results that are not as accurate as one might expect .",
    "finally , we also point out that a ti mps with pbc was already used in ref .  @xcite together with monte carlo sampling techniques , with a formal cost @xmath29 . in that case , the use of sampling techniques reduced the cost from @xmath11 to @xmath10 , but at the same time enforced the multiplicative factor @xmath1 , since a ti mps does not represent a ti state once a given configuration is chosen during the sampling .",
    "an obvious way to find the ti - mps with minimal energy is a multidimensional minimization procedure that requires only evaluations of the function itself , such as the downhill simplex method  @xcite . when no further information about the function is available , this is indeed the method of choice .",
    "it is extremely robust but also extremely slow .",
    "however , if there is a feasible way to obtain more elaborate information such as the gradient or the hessian , there are methods relying on these quantities that are clearly superior in what regards the speed of convergence and the required storage space .    in the following",
    "we will present an efficient algorithm to calculate the gradient of the energy @xmath30 where the argument @xmath31 denotes the vector containing all entries of the mps tensor @xmath32 .",
    "the result will then be used by a standard numerical library conjugate gradient algorithm to find a minimum of @xmath33 .",
    "we must emphasize that this minimum is by no means guaranteed to be the global one i.e. the optimal ground state approximation within the subspace defined by our special mps ansatz .",
    "however , our numerical results seem to be slightly more accurate than previous results @xcite , while we have obtained a reduction in computational costs",
    ". we will illustrate the accuracy of this approach by applying it to two exactly solvable models in order to give exact values for the numerical errors .",
    "the computational cost will turn out to scale as @xmath34 where @xmath0 is the virtual bond dimension and @xmath35 and @xmath18 are some parameters to be specified below . briefly speaking",
    ", the scaling can be understood as follows : first we approximate large powers of the mps transfer matrix , whose exact definition will be given later in the text , within a reduced subspace of dimension @xmath18 .",
    "treating each of the @xmath18 dimensions separately allows us to transform the contraction of a tensor network with pbc ( which scales as @xmath11 ) into @xmath18 contractions of tensor networks with obc ( each of which scales as @xmath10 ) . as we will explain in more detail in the next section",
    ", the resulting tensor networks will still contain at most one portion represented by say @xmath35 adjacent transfer matrices that is not connected to the already approximated one .",
    "if @xmath35 is large , this second portion can again be approximated within a @xmath18-dimensional subspace thereby yielding the scaling @xmath36 .",
    "if @xmath35 is small , we are forced to contract the transfer matrices one after the other which gives the scaling @xmath37 .",
    "let us rearrange the mps tensor components in a vector @xmath31 which allows us to write the energy as a function over the manifold of free parameters in the mps    @xmath38    note that due to the constraints that the matrices are real and symmetric , the number of vector components in @xmath39 has been reduced to @xmath40 . as we will treat only spin-1/2 chains ( i.e. @xmath41 ) in this work ,",
    "the variational parameter manifold is actually @xmath42-dimensional .",
    "furthermore we will denote expectation values taken with respect to the mps defined by the tensor @xmath32 as @xmath43 .    also note that ( [ eq : eexpval_veca ] ) can have local extrema as opposed to @xmath44 which is a convex quantity in the exponentially large hilbert space .",
    "the mps - parametrization restricts the full parameter space to a submanifold thus possibly generating local extrema where all derivatives in this subspace vanish . if one uses as a starting point of the conjugate gradient algorithm a random vector @xmath45 , the search algorithm will typically get stuck in a local minimum . in order to avoid getting stuck in one of these",
    ", we will choose as a starting point a vector @xmath46 of which we can be sure that it is close to the global minimum .",
    "this approach turns out to be very robust and fast .",
    "if we are interested in ground states of chains with very large @xmath1 , the most natural choice for the starting vector is an mps approximation of the gs of the same model in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "note that this mps must have exactly the same symmetry properties as our ansatz .",
    "it was shown in previous work @xcite how to obtain this mps and we will actually use the tensors computed there as starting points for the present algorithm .",
    "it is obvious why the mps for the gs of the infinite chain is a good choice if one is interested in finite pbc - chains with @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the correlation length induced by finite @xmath0 .",
    "however , it turns out that this approach also works satisfactory for moderately large @xmath1 . of course",
    ", if there already is any pbc solution available , using that one as a starting point may provide a gain in convergence time , especially if the chain lengths are similar .     of a ti spin chain with 4 sites .",

    "( c ) norm of a state @xmath51 .",

    "( e ) the expectation value is expanded in powers of @xmath50 .",

    "first , since we assume a translationally invariant hamiltonian with nearest neighbour interactions , we have @xmath54 hence the first term in ( [ eq : grad_eexpval_veca ] ) is proportional to the gradient of the energy density @xmath55 , @xmath56 $ ] ( see figure  [ fig : pbc_expval_a_expansion_large]d ) .",
    "second , we can obtain gradients such as the ones occurring in ( [ eq : grad_eexpval_veca ] ) numerically at a given point @xmath39 by expanding the differentiated quantity in powers of @xmath57 and computing the coefficient of the linear term .",

    "the computational cost for the _ exact _ contraction of the tensor networks in @xmath60 scales as @xmath64  @xcite",
    ". we will give below a prescription of how this can be improved to @xmath34 for chains of arbitrary lengths .",
    "furthermore we will show how to choose the smallest possible parameters @xmath35 and @xmath18 such that no loss in precision occurs and why the scaling reduces to @xmath65 in the case of very long chains .     and",
    ", scaledwidth=90.0% ]    the other piece that is necessary for the computation of @xmath30 , is the derivative occurring in the second term of ( [ eq : grad_eexpval_veca ] ) ; this term can be obtained in a very similar way ( see figure  [ fig : heff_neff ] ) .",
    "we will use the notation @xmath66 for the object defined by @xmath67 . due to the simpler structure of the tensor network",
    "the computational cost here will scale as @xmath68 for arbitrary chains and as @xmath10 for very long chains .",
    "now let us introduce the following convention for denoting incomplete tensor networks where merely one of the mps tensors is missing : @xmath69}$ ] shall henceforth denote the expectation value of the operator @xmath70 with respect to the ti mps defined by the tensor @xmath49 , where one tensor @xmath49 has removed been removed from @xmath71 at site @xmath72 .",
