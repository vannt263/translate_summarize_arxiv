    "<S> it is found that the spin - relaxation time can be infinite if those coupling strengths @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 satisfy either condition ( i ) @xmath4 or ( ii ) @xmath5 , which correspond to the vanishing yang - mills magnetic field . the effect caused by the application of an external magnetic field is also discussed . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the longitudinal and in - plane spin components can possess infinite life time when the spin components , the larmor precession frequency and the external magnetic field satisfy certain relations . </S>"
