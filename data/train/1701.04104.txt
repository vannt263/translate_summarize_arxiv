    "the discovery of iron - based superconductors @xcite was followed by an outpouring of theoretical and experimental studies of those and related materials @xcite . of these studies",
    "some were addressing specific details of the superconducting and the associated vortex state , whereas others were targeted comprehensive characterization of the general physical properties of iron - based superconductors and related materials .",
    "mssbauer effect spectroscopy is widely accepted as one of the most sensitive techniques in terms of energy resolution .",
    "historically , this technique has been applied to studies of superconductors for decades,@xcite however its sensitivity specifically to the superconducting state is ambiguous .",
    "@xcite it is quite natural that mssbauer spectroscopy was widely used for studies of iron - based superconductors that naturally contain the common mssbauer nuclide , @xmath0fe , in the structure,@xcite : no additional doping with @xmath0fe ( that can alter the properties of the material ) is needed , and use of partially enriched fe was required in only few , very specific cases .",
    "this technique was very successful in addressing the evolution of magnetic order , @xcite structural phase transitions , @xcite and phase purity @xcite in these materials .",
    "recently , a new family of iron - based superconductors with rather high superconducting transition temperature , @xmath6 k , has been discovered .",
    "@xcite it was found that structurally ordered caafe@xmath3as@xmath3 ( 1144 ) compounds can be formed for a = k , rb , cs , and the key to the formation is the difference in ionic sizes between the ca and the a ion .",
    "this family is not a ( ca@xmath7a@xmath8)fe@xmath5as@xmath5 solid solution , where the ca and a ions randomly occupy a single crystallographic site .",
    "@xcite along the @xmath9-axis , the ca and a ions in this family form alternating planes that are separated by the fe - as slabs ( fig .",
    "in essence , the caafe@xmath3as@xmath3 structure is similar to the cafe@xmath5as@xmath5 structure , just with layer by layer segregation of the ca and a ions .",
    "the ordering of the layers causes a change of the space group from @xmath10 to @xmath11 and the fe site in the 1144 structure has its point symmetry lowered to orthorhombic ( from the tetragonal in the 122 structure ) .",
    "the 1144 structure was also found for srafe@xmath3as@xmath3 ( a = rb , cs ) @xcite and euafe@xmath3as@xmath3 ( a = rb , cs ) .",
    "@xcite    we were able to grow single - crystalline , single - phase samples of cakfe@xmath3as@xmath3 and measure their anisotropic thermodynamic and transport properties .",
    "@xcite the data indicated that cakfe@xmath3as@xmath3 is an ordered stoichiometric superconductor with @xmath12 k and no other phase transition for 1.8 k @xmath13 300 k. it appeared to have properties very close to what is referred to as an optimally - doped , on a generalized phase diagram , iron - based superconductor .",
    "being an ordered stoichiometric compound with a high value of @xmath14 and a single crystallographic fe site , cakfe@xmath3as@xmath3 offers an exceptional opportunity to determine whether any of the hyperfine parameters exhibit an anomaly at superconducting transition .",
    "additionally , this time with a local probe , we can evaluate the phase purity ( in terms of possible fe - containing phases ) of the samples and the presence of static magnetic moment on the iron site .",
    "furthermore , we can compare the temperature dependencies of the hyperfine parameters with those of the closely related compounds , cafe@xmath5as@xmath5 and kfe@xmath5as@xmath5 .    in this work we will present results of the @xmath0fe mssbauer spectroscopy measurements between @xmath1 k and @xmath2 k on a mosaic of the oriented single crystals of cakfe@xmath3as@xmath3 and",
    "will compare the results with similar sets of data for cafe@xmath5as@xmath5 and kfe@xmath5as@xmath5 .",
    "whereas there are available literature data for cafe@xmath5as@xmath5 , @xcite the published mssbauer data for kfe@xmath5as@xmath5 apparently is limited to three temperature points @xcite so we have chosen to collect a comprehensive set of data for kfe@xmath5as@xmath5 as a part of this work .",
    "cakfe@xmath3as@xmath3 single crystals were grown by high temperature solution growth out of excess feas . the growth and basic physical properties are described in detail in ref .",
    "the crystals were screened as described in ref .",
    "@xcite to avoid possible contaminations by cafe@xmath5as@xmath5 and kfe@xmath5as@xmath5 minority phases .",
    "the superconducting transition in the cakfe@xmath3as@xmath3 crystals used for the mssbauer study was sharp with @xmath15 k ( fig .",
    "[ f2 ] ) .",
    "kfe@xmath5as@xmath5 single crystals were also grown using a high - temperature solution growth technique .",
    "starting elements were packed in an alumina frit - disc crucible set @xcite with a molar ratio of k : fe : as = 8:2:10 .",
    "the crucible set together with the material were then welded in a ta tube and sealed in a silica ampoule under a partial ar atmosphere .",
    "a detailed drawing of such an assembly can be found in ref @xcite .",
    "the ampoule was slowly heated up to 920@xmath16 c over @xmath17 hours , held at 920@xmath16 c for 10 hours , quickly cooled to 850@xmath16 c over 3 hours and then slowly cooled to 700@xmath16 c over 3 days . at 700@xmath16 c ,",
    "the silica ampoule was inverted and decanted in a centrifuge .",
    "remaining solution ( primarily k - as ) on the single crystals was rinsed off using ethanol .",
    "the resulting crystals had high residual resistivity ratio ( @xmath18 ) and @xmath14 values consistent with other high quality kfe@xmath5as@xmath5 crystals .",
    "@xcite    mssbauer spectroscopy measurements were performed using a see co. conventional , constant acceleration type spectrometer in transmission geometry with a @xmath0co(rh ) source kept at room temperature . both for cakfe@xmath3as@xmath3 and",
    "kfe@xmath5as@xmath5 the absorber was prepared as a mosaic of single crystals held on a paper disk by a small amount of apiezon n grease .",
    "the gaps between the individual crystals were kept as small as possible .",
    "the mosaic had the @xmath9 axis perpendicular to the disks and arbitrary in - plane orientation for each of the crystals .",
    "the @xmath9 axis of the crystals in the mosaic was parallel to the mssbauer @xmath19 beam .",
    "the absorber was cooled to a desired temperature using a janis model shi-850 - 5 closed cycle refrigerator ( with vibration damping ) .",
    "the driver velocity was calibrated using an @xmath20-fe foil , and all isomer shifts ( is ) are quoted relative to the @xmath20-fe foil at room temperature .",
    "the mssbauer spectra were fitted using either the commercial software package mosswinn , @xcite or the mossa package @xcite with both analyses giving very similar results .",
    "a subset of mssbauer spectra for cakfe@xmath3as@xmath3 , taken at different temperatures , is shown in fig .",
    "the absorption lines are asymmetric , suggesting that each spectrum is a quadrupole split doublet with rather small value of the quadrupole splitting , qs .",
    "there are no extra features observed , confirming that the samples are single phase .",
    "the results of fits to these data are shown in fig .",
    "the linewidth of the spectra ( fig .",
    "[ f4]d - fwhm ) varies between @xmath21 mm / s and is consistent with well ordered crystals .",
    "none of the hyperfine parameters has a detectable feature at @xmath12 k that rises above the scattering of the data or the error bars .",
    "[ f4]a presents measured isomer shift ( is ) which increases upon cooling .",
    "the isomer shift includes contributions from both the chemical shift and the second - order doppler shift .",
    "the latter is known to increase convexly upon decreasing temperature , due to gradual depopulation of the excited phonon states , but should be constant at low temperature , because of the quantum mechanical zero - point motion .",
    "the chemical shift should not depend on temperature .",
    "the main contribution to the temperature dependence of the isomer shift then is considered to be from the second - order doppler shift , and is usually described by the debye model : @xcite + @xmath22 + where @xmath9 is the velocity of light , @xmath23 is the mass of the @xmath0fe nucleus , and @xmath24 is the temperature - independent part . for the isomer shift data in fig.[f4]a debye fit yields @xmath25 k.    the quadrupole splitting increases with decrease of temperature ( fig . [ f4]b ) .",
    "the behavior can be described reasonably well with the empirical `` @xmath4 law ''",
    "@xcite , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is temperature dependent quadrupole splitting , @xmath28 is its value at @xmath29 k , @xmath30 is a parameter that was found @xcite to vary between @xmath31 and @xmath32 k@xmath33 . in our case",
    "the value of @xmath34 k@xmath33 falls within the expected range .",
    "whereas the physics behind the `` @xmath4 law '' is not fully understood ( it is considered that that it originates from thermal vibrations of the lattice @xcite ) , this relation describes reasonably well the temperature dependencies of @xmath35 observed in non - cubic metals . @xcite    the spectral area under the doublet increases on cooling ( fig .",
    "[ f4]c ) . the temperature dependence of the spectral area can also be fitted with the debye model @xcite : + @xmath36   \\right\\},\\ ] ] + where @xmath37 is the recoilless fraction , which is proportional to the area for a thin sample and e@xmath38 is the @xmath19-ray energy .",
    "the estimate of the debye temperature from the fit gives @xmath39 k , a value that is about 125 k less than the value estimated by temperature dependence of @xmath40 .",
    "although part of this discrepancy could be due to deviations from the thin absorber conditions of the measurements , it should be mentioned that similar differences were found earlier in studies of lu@xmath5fe@xmath41si@xmath42 , fese@xmath43te@xmath43 and @xmath0fe doped yba@xmath5cu@xmath41o@xmath44 compounds .",
    "@xcite this discrepancy may be explained by the fact the area reflects the average mean - square displacements , whereas @xmath40 is related to the mean - square velocity of the mssbauer atom .",
    "both quantities may respond in a different way to lattice anharmonicities .",
    "the temperature dependent linewidth of the spectra is shown in fig .",
    "overall the linewidth increases by a few percent on cooling from room temperature to the base temperature .",
    "the observed spectral lines for cakfe@xmath3as@xmath3 are somewhat narrower than those in cafe@xmath5as@xmath5 @xcite and kfe@xmath5as@xmath5 ( see below ) single crystal measurements , and measurably sharper than the mssbauer spectra lines in the substituted ca(fe@xmath45co@xmath46)@xmath5as@xmath5 @xcite that vary in the range of 0.28 - 0.35 mm / s between room temperature and 5 k. this suggests that cakfe@xmath3as@xmath3 crystals used in this work are well ordered .    in the afe@xmath5as@xmath5 ( a = ba , sr , ca , cs , rb , k ) compounds the point symmetry ( @xmath47 ) and the location of the fe site in the crystal structure constrains the principal axis of the local electric field gradient tensor to the @xmath9-crystalline axis ; as a result , a doublet lines intensity ratio of 3:1 is expected for the mosaic with the @xmath9 - axis parallel to the @xmath19 - beam . per contra , in the cakfe@xmath3as@xmath3 the point symmetry ( @xmath48 ) of the fe site formally does not impose such constrain @xcite and some deviation from the 3 : 1 ratio is expected .",
    "this said , the fe - as1 and fe - as2 bond lengths as well as as1 - fe -as1 and as2 - fe - as2 bonds angles are very similar and we would not expect significant difference from the afe@xmath5as@xmath5 case .",
    "the experimentally observed room temperature ratio is @xmath49 , and it decreases to @xmath50 at the base temperature ( fig . [ f4]e ) . very similar deviations from the 3:1 ratio were observed for measurements on cafe@xmath5as@xmath5 single crystals @xcite and several possible reasons for the doublet lines intensity ratio being different from 3:1 were discussed , e.g. a `` thick '' absorber conditions of the measurements and some misorientation of the crystals that form the absorber mosaic .",
    "the same arguments , in addition to the different point group symmetry for fe , are probably appropriate when considering the cakfe@xmath3as@xmath3 results .",
    "[ f5 ] shows a subset of mssbauer spectra of kfe@xmath5as@xmath5 taken at different temperatures .",
    "the asymmetry is even less pronounced than in the cakfe@xmath3as@xmath3 spectra above .",
    "still , good fit of the data can be obtained by using a doublet with small quadrupole splitting . for kfe@xmath5as@xmath5 , similarly to the cakfe@xmath3as@xmath3 , the principal axis of the local electric field gradient tensor should be parallel to the @xmath9-crystalline axis and the doublet lines intensity ratio of 3:1 is expected .",
    "if the fits are performed with this ratio left as a free parameter , within the error bars the expected @xmath51 is obtained for all temperatures . to reduce the uncertainty in particular , in the small values of quadrupole splitting",
    ", we repeated the fits with fixed the @xmath51 parameter .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ f6 ] . in comparison with the data obtained on powders at three different temperatures , @xcite ,",
    "our linewidth is smaller and values of the isomer shift are bigger , although the overall changes , @xmath52 , from room temperature to the base temperatures are very similar .",
    "the linewidth and its temperature dependence ( fig .",
    "[ f6]d ) are similar to those observed for cakfe@xmath3as@xmath3 .",
    "the temperature dependent isomer shift and spectral area are well fit using the debye model , as described above ( fig .",
    "[ f6]a , c ) .",
    "these fits yield the values of @xmath53 of @xmath54 k ( from @xmath55 ) and @xmath56 k ( from temperature dependent spectral area ) . in comparison with cakfe@xmath3as@xmath3 ,",
    "the debye temperatures are higher in kfe@xmath5as@xmath5 , suggesting that the lattice is stiffer .",
    "the values of quadrupole splitting ( fig .",
    "[ f6]b ) for kfe@xmath5as@xmath5 are significantly smaller than those for cakfe@xmath3as@xmath3 , moreover @xmath35 decreases with decrease of temperature , as opposed to increase following the `` @xmath4 law '' in cakfe@xmath3as@xmath3 .",
    "although the theoretical foundations of the empirical `` @xmath4 law '' are not well understood and different ( constant , vs @xmath4 ) @xmath27 behavior has been observed for related ( ce@xmath57feco@xmath41sb@xmath58 vs ce@xmath59fe@xmath3sb@xmath58 ) materials,@xcite this observation in iron - arsenides calls for further studies .",
    "since , naively speaking , the cakfe@xmath3as@xmath3 structure can be viewed as being costructed from the alternating slabs of cafe@xmath5as@xmath5 and kfe@xmath5as@xmath5 structures , it would be of use to compare the @xmath0fe hyperfine parameters of these three compounds .",
    "whereas cakfe@xmath3as@xmath3 and kfe@xmath5as@xmath5 do not exhibit static magnetic order or a structural transition below room temperature , cafe@xmath5as@xmath5 is known to be more complex .",
