    "the mechanism of supernova explosions of massive stars is still not satisfactorily understood .",
    "detailed numerical models showed that the hydrodynamic shock , which is launched when the collapsing stellar core bounces abruptly by the stiffening of the equation of state ( eos ) at nuclear densities , can not propagate out promptly but stalls because of energy losses due to photodisintegration of iron - group nuclei and neutrino emission from the shock - heated matter ( e.g. , bruenn 1985 , 1989a , b ; myra et al .",
    "early suggestions that energy deposition by neutrinos might cause an explosion reach back to colgate & white ( 1966 ) .",
    "the modern version of the neutrino - driven `` delayed '' explosion mechanism is due to wilson ( 1985 ) , who found that neutrino energy deposition can revive the stalled shock on a time scale of several hundred milliseconds after bounce ( bethe & wilson 1985 ) . because of the complexity of the involved physics and the low efficiency of the neutrino energy transfer it remained unclear for years whether the explosions are sufficiently energetic and whether the delayed mechanism works for a larger range of stellar masses ( wilson et al .",
    "1986 ; bruenn 1993 ) . recognizing that neutron - finger convection in the newly formed neutron star could increase the neutrino luminosities , wilson & mayle ( 1988 , 1993 ) managed to obtain healthy explosions .",
    "however , the question of neutron star convection is not finally settled and currently it is not clear whether neutron - finger instabilities or ledoux convection ( burrows 1987 , pons et al .",
    "1999 ) or quasi - ledoux convection ( keil , janka , & mller 1996 ; janka & keil 1998 ) or none ( bruenn et al .  1995 ; bruenn & dineva 1996 ; mezzacappa et al .",
    "1998a ) occur and how they affect the explosion .",
    "multi - dimensional hydrodynamic models ( herant et al .  1994 ; miller , wilson , & mayle 1993 ; burrows , hayes , & fryxell 1995 ; janka & mller 1996 ; mezzacappa et al .",
    "1998b ) have demonstrated the existence and the importance of convective overturn in the neutrino - heating layer behind the supernova shock .",
    "driven by a negative entropy gradient which emerges behind the weakening prompt shock and is enhanced by the neutrino energy deposition , the convective motions transport energy from the region of strongest heating to the shock , thus raising the postshock pressure and pushing the shock farther out . at the same time , cold , low - entropy matter is advected downward where it can readily absorb energy from the upstreaming neutrinos .",
    "these hydrodynamic instabilities have a bearing on the measured kick velocities of pulsars ( lyne & lorimer 1994 , cordes & chernoff 1998 ) and the anisotropies observed in many supernovae .",
    "they are essential to understand the production of radioactive elements in the vicinity of the nascent neutron star and their large - scale mixing into the hydrogen and helium layers of the exploding star ( kifonidis et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "all multi - dimensional simulations have so far been carried out with serious simplifications of the neutrino transport .",
    "even the most advanced spherically symmetric post - bounce models have only employed mgfld ( bruenn 1993 , bruenn et al .",
    "1995 ) until recently .",
    "the significance of an accurate neutrino transport for the delayed explosion mechanism , however , has long been recognized ( janka 1991 , messer et al .",
    "1998 , yamada , janka , & suzuki 1999 , burrows et al .",
    "it is therefore a natural step that a new generation of supernova models will employ schemes based on a solution of the boltzmann equation .",
    "in fact , mezzacappa et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have published results for a 13 m@xmath0 star which show that a better transport can make a qualitative change to the outcome of the simulations .",
    "however , they considered a model with an exceptionally small iron core of 1.17 m@xmath0 ( nomoto & hashimoto 1988 ) and the explosion energy was only @xmath10erg at a post - bounce time of @xmath11ms .",
    "the growth rate of this energy of @xmath12erg per 100@xmath5ms can not easily be extrapolated in time and will probably not increase the explosion energy significantly , because the density around the mass cut drops rapidly and the heating region is evacuated by the developing bifurcation between neutron star and ejecta .    in this _ letter _ we present results for a newtonian simulation of a 15 m@xmath0 star with a 1.28 m@xmath0 iron core ( woosley & weaver 1995 ) which show that an accurate neutrino transport does not produce an explosion for this star in spherical symmetry .",
    "we have developed a new transport code which determines the neutrino phase - space distribution by iteratively solving the radiation moment equations for neutrino energy and momentum coupled to the boltzmann equation .",
    "the code takes into account effects due to the motion of the stellar medium to order @xmath3 and determines the neutrino quantities in a comoving frame of reference ( rampp 2000 ; rampp & janka 2000 , in preparation ) .",
    "it allows a general relativistic treatment , but for comparison with published results we have restricted ourselves to the newtonian case .",
    "the angle dependence of the distribution function is accounted for by the use of a grid of tangent rays which exploits spherical symmetry .",
    "closure of the set of moment equations is achieved by a variable eddington factor calculated from the solution of the boltzmann equation , and the integro - differential character of the latter is tamed by making use of the integral moments of the neutrino distribution as obtained from the moment equations .",
    "the method is similar to the one described by burrows et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . in order to fulfill lepton number conservation ,",
    "we employ additional moment equations for neutrino number density and number flux .",
    "severe time step restrictions are avoided and proper establishment of equilibrium is ensured by integrating the set of transport equations implicitly in time . the stiff character of the source terms for neutrino energy and lepton number requires a simultaneous implicit update of the temperature and electron fraction of the stellar medium .",
    "the transport is coupled to the hydrodynamics code _ prometheus _ , which integrates the continuity equations for mass , momentum , energy and particle species in a conservative way on a moving radial grid by explicit time stepping .",
    "the integration is accurate to second order in space and time .",
    "shocks are treated as local riemann problems at the zone interfaces ( fryxell , mller & arnett 1989 ) .",
    "the source terms for energy and momentum due to gravity and neutrinos , and for lepton number due to neutrino emission / absorption are handled by an operator - splitting technique .",
    "the stellar background and the neutrinos are evolved on different radial grids and with different time steps , which are constrained by changes per transport step ( which is typically larger than the hydrodynamical step ) of at most 10% for the neutrino quantities and",
    "5% for the fluid quantities .",
    "interpolation between both grids is done in a conservative manner .",
    "we used the eos of lattimer & swesty ( 1991 ) ( with nuclear incompressibility modulus of @xmath13 mev ) which is extended to densities and temperatures below the regime of nuclear statistical equilibrium by an ideal gas equation of state , corrected for coulomb - lattice effects , that includes arbitrarily relativistic and degenerate electrons and positrons , photons , and a mixture of predefined nuclear species .",
    "nuclear burning was not taken into account in the present simulation .",
    "the hydrodynamics was solved on a grid with 400 radial zones out to 20000@xmath5 km , which were moved with the matter of the iron core during collapse to ensure good spatial resolution at all times , and kept fixed later . for the transport we used a eulerian grid with 210 geometrically spaced radial zones , 230 tangent rays and 27 energy bins",
    "geometrically distributed between 0 and 380 mev , the zone center of the first zone being at 1 mev .",
    "the quality of the energy conservation limits the error in the net energy deposition by neutrinos to @xmath14erg , and lepton number is globally conserved to better than 0.1% .",
    "the present simulation includes only @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the corresponding rates for charged - current and neutral - current reactions with nucleons and nuclei and for neutrino - electron scattering were taken from bruenn ( 1985 ) , mezzacappa & bruenn ( 1993 ) and bruenn & mezzacappa ( 1997 ) .",
    "we neglect production and annihilation of @xmath15 pairs , which are of minor importance compared to the charged - current reactions with nucleons .",
    "a detailed comparison of core - collapse results with published models of bruenn & mezzacappa ( 1997 ) showed excellent agreement .",
    "disregarding muon and tau neutrinos and antineutrinos and @xmath15 pair processes has virtually no effect on the neutrino heating ( see bruenn 1993 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ] shows the trajectories of selected mass shells as a function of time . the bounce shock forms 211.6@xmath5ms after the onset of the collapse at a radius of 12.5@xmath5 km with an enclosed mass of @xmath16 m@xmath0 . the central density at this time is @xmath17g@xmath5@xmath18 ( cf .",
    "bruenn & mezzacappa 1997 ) . by the rapid accretion of mass ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) the shock is pushed out to @xmath6 km .",
    "when the accretion rate drops significantly at @xmath19ms after bounce , neutrino heating is able to support further shock expansion to a radius of 350@xmath5 km . after some time",
    ", however , the shock retreats again and finally turns into a standing accretion shock around 250@xmath5 km , still within the collapsing silicon shell of the progenitor star .",
    "no indication for the possibility of an explosion was visible when the simulation was terminated at 350@xmath5ms after bounce . at this time the shock was stagnant and enclosed a mass of 1.5 m@xmath0 with increasingly negative postshock velocities .",
    "the decreasing density in the neutrino - heating region and the decay of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 luminosities do not give hope for a later rejuvenation of the shock . the overall evolution in our simulation",
    "is very similar to model wpe15ls(180)newt20 in bruenn et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , who used mgfld for the neutrino transport .",
    "the most obvious difference is a larger maximum radius of the shock , 350@xmath5 km compared to only @xmath6 km in the calculation by bruenn et al .",
    "( 1995 ) . also , the shock is able to stay near its maximum radius for a longer time and afterwards does not recede as far as in model wpe15ls(180)newt20 .",
    "the @xmath1 and @xmath2 luminosities and the root - mean - squared energies at 1000@xmath5 km are shown as functions of time in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "the prompt @xmath1 burst with a peak luminosity of @xmath20erg@xmath5s@xmath21 arrives at this radius only @xmath22ms after core bounce .",
    "about 50@xmath5ms after bounce the @xmath1 and @xmath2 luminosities have become roughly equal with a fairly stable value of ( 2.5@xmath23erg@xmath5s@xmath21 . by the end of our simulation",
    "they begin to decrease slowly , different from the mean energies , which show a gradual rise to 11.2 mev for @xmath1 and 15.5 mev for @xmath2 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] we present profiles of the net energy deposition rate by @xmath1 and @xmath24 , of the electron fraction @xmath25 and of the entropy per baryon for times 330@xmath5ms , 380@xmath5ms and 561@xmath5ms . the gain radius , below which net neutrino cooling and above which net heating occurs , is at 120140@xmath5 km ( see also fig .  [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "the heating rates peak somewhat outside the gain radius and reach up to @xmath26 mev@xmath5s@xmath21 per baryon .",
    "the cooling rate below the gain radius can exceed 200 mev@xmath5s@xmath21 per baryon at late times .",
    "maximum entropies around 13 @xmath27 per nucleon are seen at the end of the simulation , when the density behind the shock is lowest because of the decreasing mass accretion rate .",
    "the negative entropy gradient implies potential instability against convective overturn in the region between maximum heating and supernova shock . in this layer @xmath25",
    "climbs to values _",
    "larger _ than 0.5 and also develops a negative gradient .",
    "values @xmath8 were also found by mezzacappa et al .",
    "( 2000 ) in the neutrino - heated ejecta behind the outgoing shock for the successful explosion of a 13 m@xmath0 star .",
    "the neutronization of the neutrino - heated medium is determined by the absorption of @xmath1 on neutrons and of @xmath2 on protons and the inverse processes .",
    "it is sensitive to the luminosities and spectra but also to the angular distributions of the neutrinos in the heating region , which govern the efficiency of energy deposition as well as the lepton exchange with the medium .",
    "since @xmath1 decouple at a larger radius than @xmath2 , their distribution is more isotropic in the heating region , leading to a higher probability of @xmath1 absorption and thus to an increase of @xmath25 .",
    "this is enhanced by the recombination of @xmath28 particles ( fuller & meyer 1995 ) .",
    "our spherically symmetric , newtonian simulation of a 15 m@xmath0 star with a 1.28 m@xmath0 iron core , using a new boltzmann solver for the neutrino transport , did not give an explosion until 350@xmath5ms after core bounce , although the shock reached a larger maximum radius than in a comparable mgfld simulation of bruenn et al .",
    "this is probably explained by stronger neutrino heating of the postshock medium with the more accurate boltzmann transport . since both simulations were done with the same progenitor , eos , and neutrino opacities , and excellent agreement during the core - collapse phase was found , uncertainties due to the different numerics seem to be minimized .",
    "although we have only included @xmath1 and @xmath2 in our simulation , we consider our conclusions as solid , because muon and tau neutrinos would drain energy from the @xmath1 and @xmath2 luminosities but contribute to the postshock heating only at an insignificant level due to the lack of charged - current interactions .",
    "the main effect of adding pair processes would be a weakening of the early shock propagation by additional energy losses .",
    "also general relativity would probably hamper an explosion ( fryer 1999 ) , but the situation is still ambiguous ( de nisco , bruenn , & mezzacappa 1998 ; baron 1988 ) .",
    "the importance of an accurate @xmath1 and @xmath2 transport is emphasized by the finding that @xmath8 in the region of net neutrino energy deposition .",
    "this is interesting because @xmath29 was obtained in the neutrino - heated ejecta in supernova models , e.g. , by herant et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , burrows et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and janka & mller ( 1996 ) , causing a large overproduction of neutron - rich nuclei around @xmath30 and @xmath9 ( @xmath31sr , @xmath32y , @xmath33zr ) .",
    "this is in conflict with measured galactic abundances . with values",
    "@xmath8 this problem disappears ( hoffman et al .",
    "1996 ) .    using their boltzmann solver for the neutrino transport , mezzacappa et al .",
    "( 2000 ) obtained a successful , but weak explosion in case of a 13 m@xmath0 progenitor with an extraordinarily small iron core of 1.17 m@xmath0 .",
    "for a 15 m@xmath0 star with a larger core ( and therefore most likely also for more massive progenitors ) , we can not confirm a qualitative difference from spherically symmetric simulations with mgfld transport , although we find important quantitative differences with our more accurate neutrino transport . in order to obtain explosions via the neutrino - heating mechanism ,",
    "multi - dimensional simulations seem indispensable for stars with typical iron core masses .",

    "1999 )  could raise the neutrino emission significantly on the relevant time scale of a few 100@xmath5ms after bounce , and convective overturn in the postshock region has been shown by several groups to support the explosion .",
