    "there has been a surge of research in power assignment problems since 2000 ( among the earlier papers are @xcite ) this class of problems take as input a directed simple graph @xmath0 and a cost function @xmath1 .",
    "the _ power _ of a vertex @xmath2 in a directed spanning simple subgraph @xmath3 of @xmath13 is given by @xmath4 , and corresponds to the energy consumption required for wireless node @xmath2 to transmit to all nodes @xmath5 with @xmath6 .",
    "the _ power _ ( or _ total power _ ) of @xmath3 is given by @xmath7 .",
    "the study of the min - power power assignment was started by chen and huang @xcite , which consider , as we do , the case when @xmath9 is bidirected , ( that is , @xmath14 if and only if @xmath15 , and if weighted , the two edge have the same cost ; this case was sometimes called  symmetric \" or  undirected \" in the literature ) while @xmath3 is required to be strongly connected .",
    "we call this problem _ min - power strong connectivity_. we use with the same name both the ( bi)directed and the undirected version of @xmath13 .",
    "@xcite prove that the bidirected version of a minimum ( cost ) spanning tree ( mst ) of the input graph @xmath13 has power at most twice the optimum , and therefore the mst algorithm has approximation ratio at most 2 .",
    "this is known to be tight ( see section [ s_prel ] ) .",
    "we improve this to @xmath12 by combining techniques from robins - zelikovsky @xcite for steiner tree , caragiannis , flammini , and moscardelli @xcite for the broadcast version of symmetric power assignment ( assuming a bidirected @xmath16 and a  root \" @xmath17 is given , @xmath3 must contain a directed path from @xmath2 to every vertex of @xmath13 ) , together with a simple idea inspired by byrka , grandoni , rothvo , and sanit ( 2010 ) .",
    "very restricted versions of min - power strong connectivity have been proven np - hard @xcite .",
    "other than @xcite , we are not aware of better than a factor of 2 approximation except for @xcite , ( where @xmath18 , for @xmath19 ; see also @xcite ) , @xcite ( where @xmath20 is assumed to be a metric ) , and the exact ( dynamic programming ) algorithms of @xcite for the specific case where each vertex of @xmath13 maps to a point on a line , and @xmath21 is an increasing function of the euclidean distance between the images of @xmath2 and @xmath5 .",
    "a related version , also np - hard , asks for @xmath3 to be bidirected ( also called  undirected \" or  symmetric \" in previous papers ) .",
    "this problem is called min - power symmetric connectivity , and the best known ratio of @xmath22 @xcite is obtained with techniques first applied to steiner tree ; when @xmath18 one gets @xmath23 with the same method @xcite .",
    "in fact , many but not all power assignment algorithms use techniques from steiner tree variants ( or direct reduction to steiner tree variants ; these connections to steiner tree are not obvious and can not be easily explained ) , and in particular caragiannis et al @xcite uses the relative greedy heuristic of zelikovsky @xcite .",
    "new interesting techniques were also developed for power assignment problems , as in @xcite , an improvement over @xcite .",
    "the existing lower bound of the optimum , which we use , is the cost of the minimum spanning tree of @xmath13 . indeed",
    "( argument from @xcite ) , the optimum solution @xmath24 contains an in - arborescence rooted at @xmath5 , for some @xmath25 , and then , for all @xmath26 , @xmath27 is at least the cost of the directed edge connecting @xmath2 to its parent in this in - arborescence , whose total cost is at least the cost of the minimum spanning tree of @xmath13",
    ".    we also use a relative greedy method as in @xcite ; robins - zelikovsky @xcite is rarely used as a technique , and not by only citing the ratio ( improved by now in @xcite ) .",
    "we use the natural structures of @xcite to improve over the minimum spanning tree : these are _ stars _ , directed trees of height 1 .",
    "our second lower bound ( improved over @xcite ) comes from  covering \" the edges of the a spanning tree by the stars of the optimum solution . with precise definitions",
    "later , we just mention that an edge of a tree is covered by a star if it is on a path of the tree between two vertices of the star .",
    "a  cheap \" fractional covering can be easily obtained from either optimum or the linear programming relaxation . in our earlier work @xcite",
    ", we used an integer cover which was extremely hard to obtain .",
    "using fractional covers ( inspired by @xcite ) is the only significant difference of this version versus @xcite . also , interestingly",
    ", the submodularity of the covering function is only used implictly .",
    "in directed graphs , we use _ arc _ to denote a directed edge . in a directed graph @xmath28 ,",
    "an _ incoming arborescence _ rooted at @xmath29 is a spanning subgraph @xmath30 of @xmath28 such that the underlying undirected graph of @xmath30 is a tree and every vertex of @xmath30 other than @xmath31 has exactly one outgoing arc in @xmath30 .",
    "given an arc @xmath32 , its _ undirected version _ is the undirected edge with endpoints @xmath31 and @xmath33 .",
    "arcs @xmath32 and @xmath34 are _ antiparallel _ , and the antiparallel arcs resulting from undirected edge @xmath35 are @xmath35 and @xmath36 ; if undirected edge @xmath35 has cost , then each of the two antiparallel arcs resulting from undirected edge @xmath35 have this cost .",
    "we sometimes identify a spanning tree @xmath30 with its set of edges .",
    "an alternative definition of our problem ( how it was originally posed ) is : we are given a simple undirected graph @xmath0 and a cost function @xmath1 .",
    "a power assignment is a function @xmath37 , and it induces a simple directed graph @xmath38 on vertex set @xmath39 given by @xmath32 being an arc of @xmath38 if and only if @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the problem is to minimize @xmath42 subject to @xmath38 being strongly connected . to see",
    "the equivalence of the definition , given directed spanning subgraph @xmath3 , define for each @xmath17 the power assignment @xmath43 .",
    "the following known example ( see figure [ f_2mst ] ) shows that the ratio of 2 for the mst algorithm is tight .",
    "consider @xmath44 points located on a single line such that the distance between consecutive points alternates between 1 and @xmath45 , and let the cost function @xmath20 be the square of the euclidean distance then the minimum spanning tree mst connects consecutive neighbors and has power @xmath46 . on the other hand , the bidirected tree @xmath47 with arcs connecting each other node ( see figure [ f_2mst](b ) ) has power equal @xmath48 .",
    "when @xmath49 and @xmath50 , we obtain that @xmath51 . on the other hand ( argument taken from @xcite ) , for any input graph , the power of the bidirected minimum spanning tree @xmath30 is at most @xmath52 where @xmath53 for an optimum solution @xmath24 ( the last inequality is from the introduction ) .",
    "the example above may give intuition on how power assignment ( and even more specifically , min - power symmetric connectivity - the variant when @xmath3 must be bidirected mentioned in the introduction ) relates to the @xmath54-restricted steiner trees , with stars ( trees of height 1 ) taking the place of restricted components .",
    "another example from @xcite , ( see figure [ asymm ] , and the following paragraph ) , shows how min - power strong connectivity differs from min - power symmetric connectivity , and may give intuition how min - power strong connectivity relates to travelling salesman , and also min - cost strong connectivity and min - cost two - edge connectivity ( a two - edge - connected graph has an edge orientation that makes it strongly connected - see for example chapter 2 , written by a. frank , of @xcite ) .",
    "however we can not think of direct reductions either way , and , as we mention in conclusions , the methods we use only apply to certain instances of min - cost strong connectivity and min - cost two - edge connectivity .",
    "the power of a min - power strong connectivity optimum solution can be almost half the power of a min - power symmetric connectivity optimum solution for the same instance : we present a series of examples illustrated in figure [ asymm ] .",
    "the @xmath55 vertices are embedded in the plane in @xmath56 groups of @xmath57 points each .",
    "each group has two  terminals \" ( represented as thick circles in figure [ asymm ] ) , and the @xmath44 terminals are the corners of a regular @xmath44-gon with sides of length 1 .",
    "each group has another @xmath58 equally spaced points ( dashes in figure [ asymm ] ) on the line segment between the two terminals .",
    "the cost function @xmath20 is the square of the euclidean distance .",
    "it is easy to see that a minimum power assignment ensuring strong connectivity assigns a power of 1 to one thick terminal in each group and a power of @xmath59 to all other points in the group - the arcs going clockwise .",
    "the total power then equals @xmath57 . for symmetric connectivity",
    "it is necessary to assign power of 1 to all but two of the thick points , and of @xmath60 to the remaining points , which results in total power @xmath61 .",
    "also , keep in mind that the minimum spanning tree solution is a symmetric solution .",
    "this section is dedicated to proving the main result of this paper :    there exists a polynomial time algorithm for min - power strong connectivity with approximation ratio @xmath12 .",
    "[ t_main ]    the outline of the proof of theorem [ t_main ] , is as follows :    1 .   in the first subsection",
    ", we present the greedy algorithm , preceded by necessary notation .",
    "2 .   then we establish ( lemma [ l_output_good ] ) that the algorithm s output is strongly connected .",
    "3 .   a second subsection gives the analysis .",
    "it starts with the new lower bound , the fractional cover of tree edges by stars .",
    "4 .   finally ,",
    "lemma [ l_zel ] shows how the greedy method of @xcite ( applied with new parameters ) combines the two lower bounds ( the one above , and the cost of the minimum spanning tree ) to obtain the claimed approximation ratio .",
    "our algorithm uses a greedy approach similar to @xcite .",

    "moreover , any star @xmath253 has @xmath254 .",
    "thus @xmath255    from now on we coppied from the previous proof : @xmath188 where the inequation is from ( [ e_frac_cover ] ) .",
