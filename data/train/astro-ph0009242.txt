    "the amanda - b10 high energy neutrino detector was constructed between 15002000 m below the surface of the antarctic ice sheet where the optical properties are suitable for track reconstruction@xcite .",
    "the instrumented volume forms a cylinder with outer diameter of 120 m. the surface electronics are located within a kilometer of the amundsen - scott research station at the geographic south pole . the detector was commissioned in february 1997@xcite@xcite , and initial scientific results were presented at the xxivth international cosmic ray conference@xcite . reconstruction methods and detector calibration techniques",
    "are introduced in reference @xcite .",
    "amanda - b10 consists of 302 optical modules ( oms ) that contain an 8 inch diameter photomultiplier tube controlled by passive electronics and housed in a glass pressure vessel .",
    "they are connected to the surface by an electrical cable that provides high voltage and transmits the signals from the om .",
    "the simple , reliable system architecture is responsible for the low fraction of om failure ( @xmath2 10% after several years of operation , although most of the failures occur within a week of deployment ) .    in january , 2000",
    ", amanda - ii was completed .",
    "it consists of 19 strings with at total of 677 oms arranged in concentric circles , with the ten strings from amanda - b10 forming the central core of the new detector .",
    "new surface electronics consolidates several triggering functions and adds functionality .",
    "new scalers were installed that provides millisecond resolution - important for supernova studies .",
    "several technologies were deployed to evaluate their utility and readiness for future expansion to larger systems .    the search for astrophysical sources of high energy ( @xmath3 1 tev ) neutrinos is one of the central missions of the amanda detector .",
    "figure  [ fig : theory ] provides a survey of model predictions for the flux of high energy neutrinos from point objects .",
    "it also contains the flux limit reported in this manuscript for sky bins with declinations greater than 30 degrees .",
    "most theoretical models of potential astrophysical sources of neutrinos predict that the energy spectrum is very hard , approximately @xmath4@xcite .",
    "due to the hard energy spectrum , the most probable energy of the detected neutrino is well above 1 tev ( typically 10 - 30 tev ) .    in this report",
    ", we describe the status of a general search for continuous emission from point sources in the northern sky , restricted to declination greater than + @xmath5 .",
    "the observation of atmospheric neutrinos and detailed studies of downgoing atmospheric muons have been used to study the sensitivity of the detector .",
    "the observed differences between observation and prediction are within @xmath630% , which is within the systematic uncertainty . by restricting the atmospheric neutrino analysis to a search cone with a half angle of @xmath7 about zenith",
    ", a search was made for neutrino emission from wimp annihilation near the center of earth . finally , we report preliminary results for a search for high energy neutrinos from gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "neutrino signal from grbs should be correlated in direction and time , greatly simplifying background rejection .",
    "all results reported here are based on data collected between april and october of 1997 .",
    "due to limitations in the data acquisition and archiving system at that early phase of operation , the livetime ranges between 130 and 140 days , depending on the details of the analysis .",
    "the various physics objectives are best addressed by specialized analyses , although most are closely related .",
    "the search for sources of point emission can be used to illustrate the general methods .",
    "trigger events are dominated by downgoing atmospheric muons , so analysis techniques were developed to reject this background while retaining good efficiency for upgoing neutrino - induced muons . unlike many neutrino detectors , the effective sensitivity depends strongly as a function of the background rejection requirements , which are considerably weaker for searches for point sources than diffuse emission .",
    "the analysis procedure utilizes two essential characteristics of the signal to simplify the analysis relative to atmospheric neutrino measurements .",
    "first , the sources are assumed to be point sources in the sky , so only events within a selected angular region are considered .",
    "secondly , we use the topological characteristics of spectrally hard neutrino signal to reject poorly reconstructed atmospheric muons and atmospheric neutrinos , both of which have softer spectra .",
    "topological variables include an estimate of muon energy and an assessment of the spatial fluctuation of the detected signals in a given event .",
    "the complete suite of variables was able to differentiate signal events from several classes of background topologies .",
    "monte carlo based simulation programs determined the effective area for background and neutrino -induced muons .",
    "several important results from these programs were tested by comparing the background simulation to the experimental data at various steps along the analysis chain .",
    "an iterative analysis procedure was developed to maximize the @xmath8 , where the signal , s , was computed with an energy spectrum proportional to @xmath4 for the source .",
    "bg is background from atmospheric muons . after optimizing the analysis parameters ,",
    "the sensitivity was evaluated for power law spectra with indices between 2.0 and 3.0 .",
    "the space angle resolution is determined from simulation .",
    "the upper panel of figure  [ fig : angle ] shows that the median resolution is 3 degrees , and the lower panel indicates that this value only weakly depends on energy .",
    "two studies were used to check the angular resolution and absolute offset .",
    "first , events that simultaneously trigger the gasp act@xcite and amanda provide a `` test beam '' containing single muons with directional information provided by gasp . to improve the statistical accuracy of the investigation , a second study involved events which simultaneously trigger the spase air shower array@xcite and amanda .",
    "although the interpretation of these special events is complicated by the presence of multiple muons , which tend to reconstruct with worse angular precision than single muon events , the response of the detector to these events appears to be correctly modeled .",
    "[ h ]    the point source analysis yields an event sample of 1097 events which are distributed on the sky as shown ( fig.[fig : sky ] ) :    [ h ]    guided by the estimate of angular resolution , the sky was divided into 319 non - overlapping angular bins .",
    "the distribution of counts per sky bin is consistent with random fluctuations , which were determined by selecting all events within a declination band and randomly redistributing them in right ascension .",
    "[ h ]    the neutrino limits were computed according to @xmath9    where @xmath10 , is the neutrino effective area weighted by the assumed neutrino energy spectrum .",
    "this quantity is related to the muon effective area shown in figure  [ fig : area ] .",
    "the factor @xmath11 is the livetime , and @xmath12 is the efficiency due to finite angular resolution and also accounts for non - central source placement within an angular bin .",
    "the term @xmath13 generates the 90% cl according to feldman and cousins@xcite for signal events given the measured number of events in the bin , @xmath14 and the expected background @xmath15 determined from the events in the declination band containing the source bin .",
    "the results of this calculation are shown in figure  [ fig : limit ] for various assumed spectral indices .",
    "[ h ]    the inferred limits on neutrino flux apply to point sources with continuous emission ( or episodic emission averaged over a time interval of approximately 0.6 years ) and power law energy spectra with a fixed spectral index above the energy threshold of the detector .",
    "the limits for sources at large positive declination are comparable to the best published limits in the southern sky@xcite .",
    "the final event sample in the search for point sources contains both atmospheric neutrinos and poorly reconstructed downgoing muons .",
    "the fraction of atmospheric @xmath16 in the sample can be enhanced at the expense of sensitivity .",
    "experimental data is dominated initially by background events - typically downward going atmospheric muons with poorly known directions .",
    "this can be seen in figure  [ fig : atmnu_bg ] . as indicated by the flat behavior for less restrictive selection criteria ( quality @xmath17 ) .",
    "as selection criteria become progressively more restrictive ( increasing values along the x - axis ) , the asymptotic flattening of the ratio ( experimental data)/(signal mc atm.@xmath16 ) indicates that the evolution of the experimental data becomes consistent with signal expectation in the vicinity of the plot where the ( bg mc)/exp ratio approaches zero . from this evidence ( and visual inspection ) , we conclude that the contamination in the atmospheric neutrino sample from known physics effects is small ( @xmath18% ) for values of the event quality parameter greater than five .",
    "background simulations with much greater statistical precision are currently underway .",
    "[ h ]    figure  [ fig : atmnu_cos ] shows that the angular distribution of 188 events is also consistent with the simulated distribution of atmospheric @xmath16 events . due to the elongated cylindrical geometry of amanda - b10 , the acceptance shows strong dependence on zenith angle .",
    "thus , the angular dependence of the atmospheric neutrino sample is consistent with expectation and contamination from background is small .",
    "finally , the distribution of the number of oms in an event is also consistent with expectation ( see figure  [ fig : diffuse ] ) .",
    "there is strong evidence for a non - baryonic component in the dark matter in the universe .",
    "supersymmetric extensions to the standard model provide promising dark matter candidates , such as the neutralino .",
    "dark matter in the galactic halo can interact with nuclei in the earth , lose energy and become trapped .",
    "the annihilation of neutralinos within the core of the earth will generate high energy neutrinos in the nearly vertical direction ( cos@xmath19 ) .",
    "for this highly restricted search cone , the number of events observed agrees with prediction ( 17 predicted , 15 observed ) .",
    "therefore , the lack of a statistically significant excess of neutrino events in the nearly vertical direction can be used to constrain the flux of neutrinos from neutralino annihilation .",
    "figure  [ fig : wimp ] compares the amanda limits with predictions@xcite for a broad class of supersymmetric models , and with curves derived@xcite from published limits by macro@xcite and baksan@xcite , illustrating the potential of the technique .",
    "systematic errors associated with detector sensitivity and neutrino oscillation physics are currently under investigation , but are expected to weaken the limits .",
    "many models of diffuse emission from unresolved sources predict an energy spectrum that is much harder than the atmospheric neutrino spectrum .",
    "therefore , a limit on the diffuse flux can be extracted by searching for an excess of events at large energies .",
    "a simple , although not very precise , measure of energy of the neutrino - induced muons is counting the number of hit channels - optical modules that detected cherenkov light .",
    "figure  [ fig : diffuse ] shows the distribution of the hit multiplicity for experimental data , for simulated atmospheric neutrinos , and for an arbitrarily normalized , relatively hard energy spectrum .",
    "the experimental data agree with the atmospheric neutrino spectrum . from the non - observation of an excess of high multiplicity events , we derive an upper limit on an assumed diffuse @xmath4 spectrum .",
    "the preliminary limit ( 90% cl ) is of order @xmath20 .",
    "this experimental limit is below several models ( e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , although still above the recent bound established by waxman and bahcall@xcite .",
    "the experimental limit can be improved by developing better energy estimators using charge and topological distributions .",
    "the response of the detector to muons with energies in excess of 100 tev is still under investigation .",
    "gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) are thought to be produced by highly relativistic outflows originating from a compact , explosive event .",
    "a search for emission of high energy neutrinos correlated in time and direction with grbs was performed .",
    "we examined a total of 78 grbs detected by batse .",
    "the @xmath21 duration of the bursts , defined as the time required to accumulate between 0.05 - 0.95 of the total counts , varied between 0.2s and 200s .",
    "guided by several models for neutrino emission@xcite@xcite , the analysis procedure optimized the effective area of the amanda detector for neutrino energies between 100 tev and 1 pev .",
    "the lack of a statistically significant excess from any grb examined in 1997 leads to a range of limits ( the variation is primarily due to attenuation by the earth which depends on arrival direction ) on the fluence that span from @xmath22 .",
    "the parameter @xmath23 , which is of order 500 tev , is the energy that characterizes the change in the power law of neutrino spectrum ( approximately @xmath24 for @xmath25 and @xmath4 for neutrinos with energies larger than @xmath23 .",
    "another change in the spectral index is expected at even higher energies , but this feature does not impact our analysis . using all of the grbs , a preliminary cumulative upper limit of @xmath26 was also",
    "for comparison , waxman and bahcall@xcite predict a fluence of @xmath27 .",
