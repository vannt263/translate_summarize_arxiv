    "<S> kilometer@xmath0-scale neutrino detectors such as icecube , antares , and the proposed km3net neutrino observatory in the mediterranean have measured , and will continue to characterize , the atmospheric neutrino spectrum above 1 tev . </S>",
    "<S> such precise measurements enable us to probe new neutrino physics , in particular , those that arise from lorentz violation . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we first relate the effective new physics hamiltonian terms with the lorentz violating literature . </S>",
    "<S> second , we calculate the oscillation probability formulas for the two - level @xmath1 sector . finally , we comment on some of the challenges and outlook for this analysis .    </S>",
    "<S> neutrino oscillations arise from the non - alignment of the propagation and the weak - interaction hamiltonian eigenstates . in vacuum , </S>",
    "<S> the former basis is given by the neutrino mass eigenstates and scales as @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this scaling implies that precise observation of the properties of high energy neutrinos should explore small perturbations due to new physics . </S>",
    "<S> such cases have been studied in the context of astrophysical neutrinos.@xcite furthermore , the high energy component of the atmospheric neutrino spectrum  before the onset of the astrophysical component  is well understood and can also be used to look for small perturbations in the standard hamiltonian . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the oscillation probabilities that affect those high energy atmospheric neutrinos in the presence of lorentz violation .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the most generic ways to introduce new physics in neutrino oscillations is to extend the hamiltonian that drives neutrino oscillations in the following way , @xmath3 where the first term is the standard neutrino hamiltonian and the second term has the following components : @xmath4 and @xmath5 is a unitary matrix . @xmath6 and @xmath7 set the scale of the new physics and @xmath5 is the mixing matrix describing the new physics flavor structure.@xcite such new operators are explicitly introduced in the context of lorentz symmetry violation and , in general , depend on the neutrino four - momentum , @xmath8 . in the minimal standard - model extension ( sme ) , which restricts itself to dimension - four operators , only two terms are introduced:@xcite those corresponding to @xmath9 and @xmath10 . in the sme notation </S>",
    "<S> they are , respectively , denoted by @xmath11 and @xmath12 ; where @xmath13 are indices that dictate the flavor structure and @xmath14 are lorentz indices . these terms can be explicitly written in the following way @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the neutrino four - momentum . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we will impose the simplifying assumption that @xmath11 and @xmath12 are isotropic tensors , i.e. , they only have time components.@xcite in this scenario , the spatial dependence is neglected and is called isotropic lorentz violation . </S>",
    "<S> further , as the terms need to be traceless in the lorentz indices , a factor of 4/3 needs to be included . with these assumptions , eq .   simplifies to @xmath17 under this simplification , the relationship between eqs .   and </S>",
    "<S> is now apparent . in order to make it more comparable we choose to redefine @xmath18 in what follows in this paper .    </S>",
    "<S> having introduced these new terms in the hamiltonian , we must now consider where they are relevant . </S>",
    "<S> the standard hamiltonian comprises two pieces : @xmath19 and @xmath20 . the first term scales like @xmath21 , while the second one is proportional to the matter density . </S>",
    "<S> the largest squared - mass - difference makes @xmath22 gev . within the earth </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath20 has only one relevant component which is @xmath23 gev . if we then restrict ourselves to scenarios in which we consider only the @xmath24-@xmath25 sector , then only the @xmath19 scaling matters . </S>",
    "<S> this scenario leads to a back of the envelope sme parameter sensitivity estimation of @xmath26-@xmath27  gev and @xmath28-@xmath29 , where the upper and lower sensitivity ranges correspond to neutrino energies of 1 tev and 1 pev .    </S>",
    "<S> the left ( right ) figure shows the @xmath24 survival probability calculated according to eq .   for @xmath30.,title=\"fig : \" ] the left ( right ) figure shows the @xmath24 survival probability calculated according to eq .   for @xmath30.,title=\"fig : \" ]    now that we have established the scale of our search , we proceed to calculate the oscillation probabilities in this regime . </S>",
    "<S> since , in the @xmath24-@xmath25 sector , the matter potential drops out of the hamiltonian we can write it in the following way,@xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the cpt conserving @xmath33-term , for @xmath9 , and the cpt violating @xmath34-term , for @xmath10 , respectively </S>",
    "<S> . then the transition probabilities are@xcite @xmath35 where @xmath36 with @xmath37 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : oscillations ] we show the effect on @xmath24 disappearance for two values of @xmath34 ; results with @xmath33-terms have similar features .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> we start from a general parametrization of new neutrino oscillation physics , as introduced , e.g. , in argelles , @xcite and relate the the terms that arise from lorentz violation . </S>",
    "<S> then , we explicitly calculate the oscillation probabilities in the @xmath24-@xmath25 sector . </S>",
    "<S> the next step of this work requires modelling the event expectation for experiments that measure the high energy atmospheric neutrino component , such as icecube and antares . </S>",
    "<S> we then need to proceed to include systematic errors associated with the atmospheric neutrino fluxes , as considered in ref .  . </S>",
    "<S> then , we will proceed to search for the existence of lorentz violation in high energy @xmath24 data . </S>"
