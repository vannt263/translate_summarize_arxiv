    "even at the classical level , general relativity differs from other physical theories in that it accepts several alternative ` definitions ' of quasilocal energy . despite considerable efforts , no definite expression for quasilocal",
    "energy has yet appeared .",
    "in fact , different proposals provide satisfactory definitions of energy when applied to the appropriate physical situations . in the present paper",
    "we study the quasilocal energy recently proposed in ref.@xcite as applied to a kerr black hole @xcite .",
    "one of the appealing features of the definition of quasilocal energy adopted in this paper is its straightforward derivation from the gravitational action for a spatially bounded region @xcite . consider a spacetime @xmath0 foliated by spacelike hypersurfaces denoted by @xmath1 .",
    "the spacetime is spatially bounded by the three - dimensional surface @xmath2 , and the intersection of @xmath1 with the boundary @xmath2 is a two - dimensional surface @xmath3 with induced two - metric @xmath4 .",
    "the quasilocal energy of @xmath1 contained within the two - dimensional boundary @xmath3 arises from the action as the value of the hamiltonian that generates unit time translations in @xmath2 orthogonal to the surface @xmath3 .",
    "it can be expressed as the proper surface integral @xcite @xmath5 involving the trace @xmath6 of extrinsic curvature of @xmath3 as embedded in @xmath1 .",
    "the extrinsic curvature is defined so that @xmath6 equals ( minus ) the expansion of the unit outward - pointing spacelike normal to @xmath3 in @xmath1 , and units are chosen so that @xmath7 , and @xmath8 .",
    "this expression for the energy also appears in the study of self - gravitating systems in thermal equilibrium , where it plays the role of the thermodynamical energy conjugate to inverse temperature @xcite .",
    "a definition of quasilocal energy intimately related to the energy ( [ energy ] ) has been proposed in ref .",
    "for a discussion of quasilocal energy proposals , see refs . @xcite and references cited therein .",
    "the expression ( [ energy ] ) includes a subtraction term @xmath9 .",
    "this term reflects the subtraction term proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite for the gravitational action and represents a normalization of the energy with respect to a reference space .",
    "the reference space is a fixed hypersurface of some fixed spacetime and @xmath10 the trace of extrinsic curvature of a two - dimensional surface in this space whose induced metric is @xmath4 .",
    "the proposal ( [ energy ] ) is only sensible if the metric @xmath4 can be embedded uniquely in the reference space .",
    "the reference space is usually assumed to be a flat three - dimensional slice @xmath11 of flat spacetime . in this case",
    "several theorems exist @xcite that guarantee that the function @xmath10 is uniquely determined for all topologically spherical surfaces with positive curvature two - metrics . to specify the quasilocal energy one requires therefore the intrinsic metric of the surface @xmath3 and its embedding in @xmath1 as well as the embedding in the three - dimensional reference space @xmath11 of a surface whose intrinsic geometry equals that of @xmath3 .",
    "the energy ( [ energy ] ) has been previously calculated for static spacetimes @xcite , where the negative contributions to the energy arising from gravitational binding have been studied .",
    "it is of interest to extend this analysis to stationary spacetimes , and particularly to kerr black holes . besides its possible astrophysical applications ,",
    "this analysis is necessary in the study of rotating black holes in thermal equilibrium with a heat bath .",
    "for instance , one of the boundary data specified at the boundary surface for the density of states in a microcanonical ensemble description of rotating black holes @xcite is precisely the quasilocal energy ( [ energy ] ) .",
    "we evaluate in what follows the quasilocal energy ( [ energy ] ) for constant stationary time kerr slices @xmath1 spatially bounded by three different types of boundary surfaces @xmath3 with two - sphere topology .",
    "however , it is not easy to evaluate ( [ energy ] ) exactly . besides the technical problems arising from the complicated structure of the spacetime , it is not possible to embed an arbitrary two - dimensional boundary surface of the kerr space @xmath1 in @xmath11 and therefore to calculate the subtraction term @xmath9 .",
    "while exact results will be provided whenever possible , most of the energy calculations have to be performed in the slow rotation regime .",
    "this regime consists of assuming @xmath12 ( with @xmath13 denoting the specific angular momentum of the black hole and @xmath14 an appropriately defined radial distance ) , but imposes no constraints on the behavior of the adm mass @xmath15 @xcite . whilst this approximation can not give a fair description of the fast rotation regime ,",
    "it is nevertheless physically interesting and allows one to study the effects of angular momentum on the quasilocal energy .",
    "we discuss in detail the embedding for all choices of boundary surface in this approximation and estimate separately the terms @xmath16 and @xmath9 .    in section ii we present general expressions for the proper integrals involved in the quasilocal energy for arbitrary stationary axisymmetric spacetimes ( that is , without assuming the kerr metric form ) .",
    "these expressions will be useful to calculate not only @xmath16 for different choices of surfaces embedded in the kerr slice @xmath1 but also @xmath9 for appropriate surfaces embedded in @xmath11 .",
    "in section iii we consider the quasilocal energy contained within two - surfaces @xmath3 defined by constant value of the boyer - lindquist radial coordinate .",
    "these surfaces are natural counterparts ( in the case of non - zero angular momentum ) to surfaces of constant schwarzschild radius .",
    "they are naturally adapted to the coordinates and considerably simplify the calculation of the energy .",
    "in particular , the outer horizon of the kerr spacetime is a surface of this type .",
    "we then present various properties and limiting values of the energy for these surfaces and discuss the contributions due to gravitational binding .",
    "we turn in section iv to the energy contained within a round spherical boundary of the kerr slice @xmath1 .",
    "there are two advantages in the use of round spheres in the present calculation : firstly , a sphere can be always embedded in flat three - dimensional space and consequently the subtraction term @xmath9 can be easily determined .",
    "secondly , a spherical surface is particularly useful in the study of black hole thermodynamics .",
    "besides the quasilocal energy mentioned above , the boundary data for rotating black holes in a microcanonical ensemble include a chemical potential ( associated with the conserved angular momentum ) and the two - geometry @xmath17 of the two - dimensional boundary @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the adm mass @xmath15 and specific angular momentum @xmath13 of rotating black hole configurations in thermal equilibrium inside the cavity are not free parameters but have to be determined as functions of those boundary data by inverting the boundary data equations @xcite .",
    "though this procedure will not be discussed here , it is greatly simplified whenever the boundary surface is a sphere ; in this case the information about the two - geometry of the boundary surface is fully contained in the area of the sphere , which does not depend explicitly on the parameters @xmath15 and @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the quasilocal energy expressions obtained in this section are then contrasted in the appropriate limits with the corresponding expressions obtained in section iii .",
    "the quasilocal energy within the ergosurface is calculated in section v. the result is contrasted with the energy at the horizon evaluated in section iii , with the energy within a @xmath18 surface , and with the energy within a constant radius surface whose area equals the surface area of the ergosurface .",
    "we conclude with a summary of the results and some comments regarding their generalization beyond the slow rotation regime .",
