    "current fluctuations , while probably disturbing in technical applications , can be useful for understanding quantum mechanical transport processes @xcite .",
    "for instance , an open transport channel with transmission close to unity leads to sub poissonian noise , while super poissonian noise may hint on bistabilities @xcite .",
    "external driving fields enable the control of the noise level via the driving amplitude and frequency @xcite .",
    "particular examples of such driven conductors with low current noise are pumps that transport a fixed charge per cycle @xcite .",
    "moreover , noise measurements may provide evidence for the correct operation of protocols that induce a steady - state version @xcite of coherent transport by adiabatic passage @xcite .",
    "current fluctuations can be characterized by the low - frequency limit of the current correlation function which corresponds to the variance of the transported charge @xcite .",
    "this allows one to introduce the fano factor as a dimensionless measure for the noise level using the poisson process as reference @xcite .",
    "going beyond the variance , one may consider the full counting statistics of the transported electrons @xcite or the related waiting - time distribution of consecutive transport events @xcite .    for master equation descriptions of _ time - independent _ transport",
    ", the calculation of the full counting statistics can be formulated as a non - hermitian eigenvalue problem with a subsequent computation of derivatives with respect to a counting variable @xcite . for systems with very few degrees of freedom",
    ", this may provide all cumulants analytically @xcite . for a numerical treatment",
    ", however , one likes to avoid the probably unstable computation of higher - order derivatives , which can be achieved by an iterative scheme based on rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "these eigenvalue based methods are generally not applicable for conductors with an arbitrary _ time - dependence _ , so that one has to seek for alternatives .",
    "one option is a number - resolved master equation in which the number of transported electrons is introduced as an additional degree of freedom @xcite .",
    "however , the distribution of this number may be rather broad and , thus , the computational effort may become tremendous . a more efficient approach is based on a density operator like object that contains information about the second moment of the transported charge @xcite . a numerical solution of the corresponding equations of motion provides the current and its variance with moderate numerical effort . with the present work we generalize this idea and derive a propagation method for computing current cumulants up to a given order .",
    "our paper is structured as follows . in sec .  [",
    "sec : formalism ] , we introduce a master equation description of the full - counting statistics and derive our iteration scheme . in sec .",
    "[ sec : testcases ] , we explore the numerical stability of our method for two time - independent test cases and finally in sec .",
    "[ sec : applications ] study cumulants of higher order for two driven models of recent interest , namely steady - state ctap and lzsm interference .",
    "we consider transport problems that can be captured by a master equation of the form @xmath0 + \\sum_\\ell\\mathcal{l}_\\ell(t)\\rho \\equiv \\mathcal{l}(t)\\rho , \\ ] ] where @xmath1 accounts for the coherent quantum dynamics of a central conductor such as a quantum dot array driven by time - dependent gate voltages .",
    "the conductor is coupled to two or more electron reservoirs that allow for incoherent electron tunneling from and to the reservoirs .",
    "these processes are described by the generally also time - dependent super operators @xmath2 which contain the forward and backward current super operators @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively . for a specific example of these super operators , see sec .",
    "[ sec : testcases ] .      the electron transport can be considered as a stochastic process with the random variable @xmath5 , the net number of electrons transported to lead @xmath6 or , equivalently , the electron number in that lead ( to achieve a compact notation , we henceforth suppress the lead index @xmath6 and the time argument ) .",
    "its statistical properties can be captured by the moment generating function @xmath7 with the moments @xmath8 , while their irreducible parts , the cumulants @xmath9 , are generated from @xmath10 @xcite . for markovian time - independent transport problems ,",
    "the cumulants eventually grow linearly in time @xcite which motives the definition of the _ current cumulants _ as the time derivatives @xmath11 , which are our main quantities of interest .",
    "their generating function reads @xmath12 which implies @xmath13 .",
    "while the master equation contains the full information about the central conductor , the leads degrees of freedom have been traced out in course of its derivation . to nevertheless keep track of the electron number in lead @xmath6 , one multiplies the full density operator by a counting factor @xmath14 for the lead electrons to obtain the generalized density operator @xmath15 .",
    "it relates to the moment generating function via @xmath16 and obeys the generalized master equation @xcite @xmath17 r(\\chi ) .\\ ] ] the additional term @xmath18 is composed of the forward and the backward current operators @xmath19 mentioned above .",
    "the generalized master equation together with the generating functions and in principle already provides the current cumulants @xmath20 .",
    "the direct numerical evaluation of these expressions , however , is hindered by two obstacles .",
    "first , the numerical computation of derivatives becomes increasingly difficult with the order .",
    "second , the relation between cumulants and moments is known only implicitly via the taylor series for @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "therefore we have to bring the generalized master equation to a form that is more suitable for extracting information about the @xmath20 .",
    "we start by writing the current cumulant generating function in terms of the generalized density operator @xmath15 . from the definitions @xmath23 and @xmath24 together with the generalized master equation follows",
    "straightforwardly @xmath25 ( notice that @xmath26 ) with the auxiliary operator @xmath27 moreover , we find the equation of motion @xmath28 x(\\chi ) .\\ ] ] we continue by substituting the dependence on the continuous counting variable @xmath29 by the taylor coefficients @xmath30 and @xmath31 which we define via the series @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "notice that @xmath34 such that @xmath35 while for @xmath36 , @xmath37 . finally , we obtain from eqs .   and the hierarchy of equations @xmath38 it constitutes the central formal achievement of this paper and forms the basis of the numerical results presented below .",
    "two features are worth being emphasized .",
    "first , in the limit @xmath39 , @xmath40 becomes the reduced density operator , i.e. , for @xmath41 , eq .",
    "is identical to the master equation .",
    "second , as an important consequence of @xmath35 and @xmath42 , the summations on the r.h.s .  of these equations terminate at @xmath43 , which implies that @xmath44 and @xmath20 depend only on terms of lower order .",
    "this enables the truncation at arbitrary order and , thus , the iterative computation of the current cumulants .    the numerical effort of our scheme can be estimated as follows .",
    "let us assume that ( if necessary after a full or a partial @xcite rotating - wave approximation ) the liouvillian @xmath45 can be written as a @xmath46-matrix and that its smallest decay rate is @xmath47 .",
    "then to compute the first @xmath48 cumulants , we have to propagate @xmath49 scalar equations for a time @xmath50 , where one is typically interested in the first @xmath51@xmath52 cumulants .",
    "to highlight the efficiency of our method , we compare this effort with that of the number - resolved master equation @xcite , for which the density operator is extended by a variable @xmath53 that accounts for the number of transported electrons . in the markovian case ,",
    "coherences between different @xmath54 do not play a role , such that one essentially has to replace @xmath55 by the @xmath56 density operators @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the probability that @xmath54 electrons have arrived at a certain lead . during the time @xmath59 , on average @xmath60 electrons flow , so that one would have to employ a number - resolved master equation with @xmath61 , i.e. , one has to integrate @xmath62 scalar equations .",
    "this means that whenever @xmath63 , our method outperforms this alternative significantly .",
    "this is for example the case when the system infrequently switches between two states with different conductance @xcite .",
    "a further advantage of our method is that it provides direct access to the cumulants , such that the detour via the moments can be avoided .",
    "equations   and resemble the iterative scheme derived in refs .",
    "@xcite for the cumulants of _ time - independent _ transport problems .",
    "let us therefore establish a connection between both methods .",
    "if @xmath45 is time - independent , the original master equation possesses a stationary solution @xmath64 which for @xmath41 also solves eq .  .",
    "for @xmath36 , we make use of the fact that @xmath65 which implies @xmath66 .",
    "consequently , eq .   possesses also for @xmath36 a stationary solution .",
    "formally it can be written with the help of the pseudo - inverse of the liouvillian @xmath67 , where @xmath68 projects to the subspace in which @xmath45 is regular .",
    "therefore , the condition @xmath69 together with @xmath70 results in @xmath71 while @xmath72 .",
    "equations   and represent the time - independent markovian limit of the known iteration scheme for cumulants @xcite .",
    "before addressing time - dependent transport problems , let us start with two time - independent systems which can be solved either analytically or with the iteration scheme of ref .",
    "this allows us to draw conclusions about the numerical stability of our method . to this end",
    ", we consider the cumulant ratio @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the fano factor .    despite the general validity of our formalism ,",
    "in all applications , we consider an array of @xmath54 quantum dots with the first dot coupled to an electron source @xmath75 , while the last site is coupled to a drain @xmath76 .",
    "then the dot - lead tunnelings can be written as @xmath77 with the lindblad form @xmath78 and the tunnel rates @xmath79 .",
    "we evaluate the current at the source , @xmath80 , such that the forward current operator becomes @xmath81 , while the backward current operator @xmath82 vanishes .       for time - independent test cases .",
    "the symbols are obtained with our propagation method , while the lines interpolate the results of the iteration scheme based on eq .  .",
    "( a ) asymmetric single - electron transistor for large bias and various dot - lead rates @xmath79 .",
    "( b ) triple quantum dot in ring configuration with @xmath83 , where dot  2 is detuned by @xmath84 . for graphical reasons , we plot @xmath85 . ]",
    "one of the simplest transport setups is the single - electron transistor which consists of a resonant level between two strongly biased leads .",
    "it can be occupied by at most one electron so that the liouvillian and the forward current operator read @xmath86 respectively . for the symmetric case , @xmath87 ,",
    "the cumulants of the single - electron transistor are known analytically as @xmath88 @xcite , which makes this system an ideal test case .",
    "consequently , all cumulant ratios @xmath89 are identical to the fano factor .",
    "for any @xmath90 , the cumulants can not be written in a closed form , but exhibit a generic behavior : while cumulants of low order reflect the nature of the transport process , high - order cumulants oscillate in a universal manner @xcite .",
    "therefore the symmetric case with its constant @xmath91 is rather special and should be sensitive to numerical errors .    by solving eqs .   and",
    "numerically , we have found that for @xmath87 , the first @xmath92 cumulant ratios agree with the analytical prediction with a precision @xmath93 ( not shown ) . for slight asymmetries ,",
    "we compare in fig .",
    "[ fig : test](a ) our results with those obtained by the traditional iteration scheme .",
    "both agree rather well also for orders at which the cumulants exhibit universal oscillations .      as a further test case",
    ", we consider a ring of three quantum dots , where dots  1 and 3 are is coupled to source and drain , respectively , while dot  2 is detuned by a onsite energy @xmath94 .",
    "the corresponding single - particle hamiltonian reads @xmath95 transport may thus occur by direct tunneling from the first to the last dot or via dot  2 . for strong detuning , @xmath96 ,",
    "the latter path has the effective tunnel matrix element @xmath97 .",
    "thus in the limit of strong coulomb repulsion , the situation is that of a slow and a fast channel which block one another .",
    "this typically leads to bunching visible in a super poissonian fano factor @xcite .",
    "the triple quantum dot ring combines several difficulties such as different time scales , quantum interference , and cumulants that grow exponentially with their index @xcite .",
    "the corresponding stiff differential equations represent challenging test cases for propagation methods .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : test](b ) we again compare the results of our method with those of the iteration of eq .  . as for the double quantum dot",
    ", we find that for the first 20 cumulants , the results of both methods are practically indistinguishable .",
    "owing to the mentioned difficulties , however , calculations for more than roughly 15 cumulants require a rather high numerical precision and , thus , are time consuming .",
    "nevertheless , we can conclude that for the experimentally relevant orders , our scheme is still efficient and numerically stable .",
    "to demonstrate the practical use of our time - dependent iteration scheme , we apply it to various physical situations that have been studied recently , i.e. , we generalize previous calculations of the current or the fano factor to cumulants of higher order .      .",
    "the delay within a double pulse is @xmath98 , while the time between the pairs is @xmath99 .",
    "( b ) corresponding time evolution of the current cumulants @xmath20 , @xmath100 , for the dot - lead rates @xmath101 @xcite . ]     together with the cumulants @xmath102 for @xmath103 .",
    "all other parameters are as in fig .",
    "[ fig : ctap ] . ]",
    "let us consider a triple quantum dot described by the single - particle hamiltonian @xmath104 if the tunnel couplings @xmath105 are switched adiabatically slowly , the system may follow the adiabatic eigenstate @xmath106 .",
    "in this way , it is possible to transfer an electron from the first dot to the last dot without populating the middle dot @xcite , an effect known as ctap .",
    "this non - local version of an optical lambda transition @xcite has also been predicted for atoms in multi - stable traps @xcite .    experimental evidence of the direct tunneling from the first to the last dot is hindered by the backaction of a population measurement , which creates decoherence @xcite and , thus , may induce the effect that one wishes to demonstrate . to circumvent this problem ,",
    "is has been suggested @xcite to contact the triple quantum dot to an electron source and drain and to employ the sequence of double gauss pulses @xmath107\\ ] ] with width @xmath108 , delay @xmath109 , and repetition time @xmath110 , as is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : ctap](a ) .",
    "notice the so - called counter intuitive order of the pulses in which the tunnel matrix element @xmath111 is active before @xmath112 .",
    "in the ideal case , this sequence will lead to the transport of one electron per double pulse and , thus , induce a current with a low fano factor which may serve as experimental verification of ctap .",
    "while in ref .",
    "@xcite only the second current cumulant have been considered , we here focus on cumulants of higher order .",
    "we again assume that coulomb repulsion inhibits the occupation with more than one electron .",
    "then we have to add the empty state to the hamiltonian , while the dissipative parts of the liouville equation and the current operator remain the same as in the last section .",
    "figure  [ fig : ctap](b ) shows the time evolution of the first four current cumulants . after a transient stage of roughly @xmath113 ,",
    "the dynamics assumes its long time limit , from which we compute the steady state values of the cumulants as the average over the driving period .",
    "the time evolution illustrates that generally the duration of the transient stage increases with the cumulant order .",
    "the central issue of verifying ctap via noise measurements is the correlation between the fano factor and the population of the middle dot as a function of the driving period @xmath110 .",
    "by contrast , the current correlates only weakly with the population and can not serve as indicator @xcite .",
    "notice that a non - trivial value for the correlation coefficient requires a non - monotonic variation of both curves , which indeed is the case .",
    "going beyond this , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : ctapf ] the corresponding cumulants of higher order averaged over one driving period in the long - time limit .",
    "we find that the third cumulant also correlates with the occupation , while for the fourth cumulant only the absolute value behaves in this way .",
    "interestingly enough , the profile of @xmath114 and @xmath115 cumulant is even sharper than that of the zero - frequency noise @xmath116 considered in ref .",
    "thus , the measurement of further cumulants will strengthen the evidence for the correct operation of a steady - state ctap protocol .",

    "the dashed horizontal lines mark the amplitude considered in fig .",
    "[ fig : lzsm ] . ]     for the lzsm interference patterns for the driving amplitude @xmath121 marked in fig .",
    "[ fig : lzsm2d](a ) by a horizontal line . ]",
    "a paradigmatic example for time - dependent quantum mechanics is a two - level system with the single - particle hamiltonian @xmath122 the tunnel matrix element @xmath123 , and the time - dependent bias @xmath124 for driving amplitudes @xmath125 , the eigenenergies of @xmath1 as a function of time form avoided crossings . at these crossings ,",
    "an electron may perform landau - zener transitions , such that repeated sweeps lead to the so - called lzsm interference . in a closed system , this is visible in a characteristic pattern of the population as a function of the detuning @xmath126 and the amplitude @xmath118 @xcite . having been measured originally for the population of superconducting qubits @xcite , such patterns have been found also for the current in a biased open double quantum dot @xcite . for deeper understanding , we extend previous results for the average current to a study of current cumulants .",
    "figure  [ fig : lzsm2d](a ) shows the lzsm interference pattern for the time - averaged current , i.e. , the first cumulant @xmath127 .",
    "it exhibits the typical structure found in the high - frequency limit , namely lorentzian resonance peaks which by and large are modulated along the @xmath118-axis by the squares of bessel functions @xcite . for the second cumulant [ fig .",
    "[ fig : lzsm2d](b ) ] , the corresponding peaks split into double peaks whose local minima coincide with the current maxima . as a consequence , the corresponding fano factor [ fig .",
    "[ fig : lzsm2d](c ) ] assumes clearly sub poissonian values of @xmath128 , while off the resonance , the fano factor indicates poissonian transport .    for a closer and more quantitative investigation , we depict in fig .",
    "[ fig : lzsm ] the first 4 cumulants as a function of the detuning @xmath126 for constant driving amplitude . on the one hand",
    ", this highlights the double peak structure of @xmath116 and indicates that at the edge of the current peaks @xmath129 which corresponds to the poissonian @xmath130 .",
    "the third and the fourth cumulants possess a similar double peak structure , where the magnitude of the @xmath20 diminishes with the order @xmath131 .",
    "this affirms the low - noise properties of resonantly driven transport in coupled quantum dots  @xcite .",
    "we have developed a method for the iterative computation of current cumulants for conductors described by a time - dependent markovian master equation . for such transport problems",
    "the only generic way to obtain a solution is a numerical propagation while generally eigenvalue - based methods are not applicable .",
    "our scheme is based on a hierarchy of density operator like objects truncated according to desired number of cumulants .",
    "the cumulants follow in a direct manner by taking the trace . as compared to the propagation of a number - resolved density matrix , our scheme possesses two advantages .",
    "first , it generally gets along with a significantly smaller set of equations .",
    "second , there is no need to compute the cumulants from the moments , a numerically critical task that may involve computing small differences of much larger numbers .    as a test bench ,",
    "we have employed two time - independent master equations which can be solved also with previously known eigenvalue - based methods .",
    "this indicated that our scheme provides reliable results for roughly the first 10 cumulants even for challenging test cases . for less demanding situations , computing more than 30 cumulants",
    "is feasible .",
    "thus , we reach orders way beyond the present experimental needs .    we have applied our scheme to two time - dependent systems of recent interest . for steady - state ctap",
    ", we have found that not only the second cumulant , but also higher ones correlate with the population of the middle dot .",
    "therefore they may provide additional evidence for the correct operation of a ctap protocol .",
    "a similar conclusion can be drawn for landau - zener interference patterns of the current in open double quantum dots .",
    "the higher - order cumulants substantiate the conclusions drawn from studies of the fano factor .    in this spirit",
    ", our approach enables studies of the current noise for time - dependent transport beyond the second cumulant with a moderate computational effort .",
    "this may provide additional insight to the underlying transport mechanisms and a deeper understanding of the electron dynamics controlled by arbitrarily shaped pulses .",
