    "unitary braid representations have been constructed in several ways using the representation theory of kac - moody algebras and quantum groups , see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "such representations easily lead to representations of @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the center of @xmath0 , and @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the center of @xmath16 .",
    "we give a complete classification of simple unitary representations of @xmath0 of dimension @xmath1 in this paper . in particular , the unitarizability of a braid representation depends only on the the eigenvalues @xmath17 of the images the two generating twists of @xmath0 .",
    "the condition for unitarizability is a set of linear inequalities in the logarithms of these eigenvalues . in other words ,",
    "the representation is unitarizable if and only if the @xmath18 is a point inside a polyhedron in @xmath19 , where we give the equations of the hyperplanes that bound this polyhedron .",
    "this classification shows that the approaches mentioned previously do not produce all possible unitary braid representations .",
    "we obtain representations that seem to be new for @xmath20 .",
    "as any unitary representation of @xmath21 restricts to a unitary representation of @xmath0 in an obvious way , these results may also be useful in classifying such representation of @xmath21 .",
    "i would like to thank my advisor , hans wenzl for the ideas he contributed to this paper and nolan wallach for his suggestions .",
    "let @xmath0 be generated by @xmath2 and @xmath3 with the relation @xmath22 .",
    "it is well - known that the center of @xmath0 is generated by @xmath23 .",
    "let @xmath24 be any field .",
    "if @xmath25 is a simple representation of @xmath0 on a @xmath24-vector space @xmath26 , then @xmath27 must act on @xmath26 as a scalar @xmath28 .",
    "since @xmath2 and @xmath3 are conjugates via @xmath29 , their images @xmath30 and @xmath31 have the same eigenvalues @xmath17 .",
    "we will need the following two results from @xcite .",
    "[ mainbraidthm ]    1 .",
    "let @xmath24 be an algebraically closed field , @xmath26 a @xmath32-dimensional @xmath24-vector space , and @xmath33 , where @xmath34 .",
    "there exists a simple representation @xmath4 such that the eigenvalues of @xmath30 satisfy @xmath35 for all @xmath36 where the polynomials @xmath37 are as follows : @xmath38 @xmath39 with @xmath40 .",

    "a simple representation of @xmath0 of dimension @xmath1 is uniquely determined up to isomorphism by the eigenvalues of @xmath30 ( for @xmath46 ) and @xmath47 , where @xmath48 ( for @xmath49 ) .",
    "explicit matrices for @xmath30 and @xmath31 are also listed in @xcite .",
    "the functions @xmath37 are defined in @xcite by @xmath50 , where @xmath51 . note that substituting @xmath52 and taking logarithms reduces the problem of finding the zeroes of @xmath37 to solving a system of linear equations in the @xmath53 .",
    "( see example [ exampled=3 ] . )",
    "let @xmath4 be a simple representation of dimension @xmath1 .",
    "then the minimal polynomials of @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the same as their characteristic polynomials .",
    "an immediate consequence of this is    [ diagonalizable ] if @xmath54 ( or @xmath55 ) is a diagonalizable matrix , then it has distinct eigenvalues @xmath17 .",
    "since @xmath54 is conjugate to some diagonal matrix @xmath56 , its minimal polynomial is just @xmath57 where the @xmath58 are the distinct diagonal entries of @xmath56 . by the previous proposition , @xmath59 ,",
    "hence @xmath56 must have @xmath32 distinct diagonal entries .",
    "thus all of the diagonal entries of @xmath56 are distinct .",
    "since we are interested in unitarizable representations , we will let @xmath60 and we will require that @xmath61 . let @xmath62 be a simple @xmath32-dimensional representation ( @xmath1 ) , and @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "any unitarizable complex matrix is diagonalizable , so we can assume that @xmath54 and @xmath55 are diagonalizable .",
