    "resonant tunneling in semiconductor heterostructures has been widely investigated ever since tsu and esaki proposed the double - barrier resonant - tunneling diode@xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "new developments came through from studies of interlayer tunneling spectroscopy between parallel two - dimensional electron systems ( 2des ) using the technique of independent contacts to closely located 2des .",
    "the 2des are formed in two gaas quantum wells ( qw ) separated by a al@xmath0ga@xmath1as barrier . because the in - plane momentum and the energy are conserved , the 2d-2d tunneling current exhibits sharp resonance peak whose broadening is determined by different collision processes in the nonideal double quantum well ( dqw ) structure .",
    "this property allows to study scattering mechanisms through tunneling spectroscopy method.@xcite furthermore , broadening effects may be important in a novel quantum transistor based on 2d-2d tunneling in independently contacted dqws.@xcite    the aim of this paper is to describe the lineshape of the resonant tunneling current in nonideal dqws with independent contacts to each qw , when , in addition to usual homogeneous broadening induced by short - range scattering , the inhomogeneous broadening due to large - scale variations of heterointerfaces is taken into account .",
    "the latter scattering mechanism has an essential effect on the form of the peak , because smooth variations of the dqw energy levels due to large - scale random variations of the widths of right ( @xmath2- ) and left ( @xmath3- ) qws can not be screened , even though the screening potential involves all possible redistributions of electrons within the dqw structure .",
    "even though the averaged large - scale potential is screened in heavily doped structures , the intersubband energy is still nonuniform over the plane of the quantum well . in fig .",
    "1 , a schematic view of the band diagram of dqws and spatial variations of the energy levels are depicted for illustration .",
    "our theory is valid when the dqw width is smaller than the correlation length @xmath4 for nonuniformities of the heterointerfaces in the dqw .",
    "a very similar mechanism was recently proposed in a single quantum well for describing the inhomogeneous broadening of intersubband transitions , with one subband occupancy , @xcite and for new effects in classical magnetotransport in the case of double subband occupancy.[8 ]    we show that the lorentzian lineshape for the tunneling current peak , in the case of short - range collision - induced broadening , assumes a gaussian shape due to the inhomogeneous broadening , if nonlocal effects are discarded due to sufficiently large @xmath4 .",
    "however , for not too large @xmath5 we obtain the transformation from a gaussian to lorentzian lineshape due to nonlocal effects on the inhomogeneous broadening .",
    "moreover , inhomogeneous and nonlocal effects essentially modify the half width at half maximum ( hwhm ) of the peak .",
    "as it is shown below , our theoretical results are in quite reasonable agreement with the experimental ones of ref .",
