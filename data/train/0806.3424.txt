    "is actually devoted to the stability analysis of the scalar gurtin - maccamy model @xcite , but it can be extended straightforwardly to the @xmath262-dimensional system ( @xmath263 ) @xmath264 where @xmath265\\times[0,+\\infty)\\rightarrow\\mathbb{r}^{m}$ ] is the @xmath262-vector of population densities , @xmath266\\times\\mathbb{r}^{n}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{r}^{m\\times m}$ ] are the matrices of mortality and fertility rates , respectively , and @xmath267 ( @xmath268 ) is the @xmath269-vector of population sizes , i.e. a selection of @xmath269 homogeneous population sub - classes through the weight function @xmath270\\rightarrow\\mathbb{r}^{n\\times m}$ ] .     as @xmath36 varies ( @xmath271 in ( [ plus])).,width=283 ]    the epidemic model ( [ eq ] ) we are interested in fits into ( [ gurt ] ) by choosing @xmath272 , @xmath273 , the population vector @xmath274 and the size vector @xmath275 which corresponds to selecting @xmath276 moreover , the matrices relative to the vital rates are given by @xmath277 and @xmath278    within this framework we consider the special choices of section [ secexun ] , namely ( [ choices ] ) and ( [ plus ] ) with @xmath271 , letting @xmath36 vary along the corresponding equilibrium curve represented in figure [ fig2 ] ( the third curve from the right ) .",
    "for each point on the curve ( included those corresponding to the disease - free equilibrium for @xmath279 ) we are able to compute the rightmost characteristic root ( rounded to machine precision , see @xcite ) and thus to say whether the corresponding equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable or not .",
    "the overall situation is illustrated in figure [ fig3 ] where solid lines denote stability and dashed lines denote instability .",
    "we start our analysis from the right hand branch of the disease free equilibrium by investigating , for instance , the spectrum for @xmath280 ( a in figure [ fig3 ] and figure [ fig6 ] ) : the rightmost roots have negative real part and hence the trivial equilibrium is stable . by decreasing @xmath36 the real root moves to the right until at @xmath281 it crosses the imaginary axis rightward ( b ) .",
    "this first bifurcation makes the trivial equilibrium lose its stability and a branch of endemic equilibria raises . following the disease - free branch by further decreasing",
    "@xmath36 it is confirmed that the instability persists ( c , @xmath282 ) .",
    "going back to the bifurcation point at @xmath283 , we now follow the endemic branch by increasing @xmath36 .",
    "the branch is unstable ( d , @xmath284 ) until at @xmath285 the leading root crosses the imaginary axis leftward ( e ) .",
    "( @xmath271 in ( [ plus])).,title=\"fig:\",width=219 ]   ( @xmath271 in ( [ plus])).,title=\"fig:\",width=219 ]   ( @xmath271 in ( [ plus])).,title=\"fig:\",width=219 ]   ( @xmath271 in ( [ plus])).,title=\"fig:\",width=219 ]   ( @xmath271 in ( [ plus])).,title=\"fig:\",width=219 ]   ( @xmath271 in ( [ plus])).,title=\"fig:\",width=219 ]   ( @xmath271 in ( [ plus])).,title=\"fig:\",width=219 ]    this second bifurcation makes the endemic equilibrium gain back its stability",
    ". then the branch continues by decreasing @xmath36 again and at @xmath284 ( f ) the second endemic equilibrium is stable opposite to the first one for the same value of @xmath36 ( d ) . the branch remains stable by further decreasing @xmath36 ( f , @xmath282 ) .",
    "as @xmath36 varies ( left ) and relevant characteristic roots ( right ) for @xmath286 , value at which a hopf bifurcation occurs ( black dot in the left figure).,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]   as @xmath36 varies ( left ) and relevant characteristic roots ( right ) for @xmath286 , value at which a hopf bifurcation occurs ( black dot in the left figure).,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]    similar trends are obtained for other values of @xmath162 for which double endemic equilibria exist . on the other side , for those values of @xmath162 for which only one endemic equilibrium exists ( for instance @xmath287 in figure [ fig2 ] ) , it can be observed by the roots computation that at the first bifurcation the disease - free equilibrium loses its stability in favour of the endemic one .",
    "this latter then preserves its stability for decreasing values of @xmath36 down to @xmath119 .    as a consequence of the destabilisation shown in section [ secsette ] , it is possible that under different choices of the parameters a hopf bifurcation occurs . in fact , if we consider the same choices made in ( [ choices ] ) for @xmath288 and @xmath289 , but set @xmath290 we get the bifurcation diagram represented in figure [ fig4 ] ( left ) .",
    "the black dot , corresponding to @xmath291 , indicates a hopf bifurcation through which the equilibrium on the stable branch ( as usual in solid line ) loses its stability and a limit cycle arises .",
    "the right figure shows the existence of the corresponding couple of characteristic roots crossing the imaginary axis from left to right as @xmath36 decreases .",
    "thus , in this case the disease - induced mortality has a stabilising effect .",
    "we can also show a choice of the parameters for which the diagram is closed and there is , for increasing @xmath36 , a destabilisation and , successively , a stabilisation .",
    "in fact , for @xmath292 one has the bifurcation diagram of figure [ fig5 ] .     as @xmath36 varies .",
    "the dotted line corresponds to periodic solutions.,width=302 ]",
    "the epidemic model studied here differs from the classical ones for the population size , which is not constant .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , this leads to the possibility of having multiple endemic equilibria . in our case , which is regulated by a very different mechanism , we are able to show that under some conditions two endemic equilibria occur .",
    "one of them is unstable and the other is stable .",
    "it is well known that , when the population size is fixed and transmission is inter - cohort , one has uniqueness of endemic states .",
    "see for example @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the stability of the steady states is studied in @xcite , @xcite and we obtain here an analogous stability change for the trivial equilibrium .    for the sake of simplicity we have limited ourselves to investigating the case of inter - cohort transmission . allowing for a general transmission kernel",
    "@xmath293 makes the analysis of the model very difficult already in the case of constant population size ( see @xcite ) , while we wished to emphasise the peculiarities due to infection - related deaths .",
    "the situation where multiple endemic equilibria exist may not be realistic .",
    "in fact , the model studied assumes that contagion can happen only in the first and in the last period of an individual life .",
    "a somehow similar situation was studied in @xcite , where the infection rate is piecewise constant .",
    "more precisely , juveniles and noncore adults can not be infected , while only core adults can .",
    "we have shown that the model with age - structured contact rates and variable population , because of infection - related deaths , has a much richer bifurcation diagram than models with only one of these features .",
    "for example , if ( [ choices - stab ] ) , ( [ hyp - radim ] ) and ( [ choices - stab2 ] ) hold , there is a change of stability and the presence of the extra - mortality destabilises the endemic equilibrium . moreover , if either ( [ choices2 ] ) or ( [ choices3 ] ) holds , hopf bifurcations occur .",
    "we believe to have shown the main theoretical steps necessary to determine the stationary solutions of the model and their stability properties , adding the use of the numerical tool provided in @xcite whenever analytical conclusions are hard , when not impossible , to draw .",
    "we also have highlighted the complexity of this model , that presents different kinds of dynamics .",
