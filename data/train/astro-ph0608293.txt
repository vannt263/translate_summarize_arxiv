    "in late october of 2003 the earth experienced an extraordinary amount of solar and geomagnetic activity originating from solar region noaa 10486 , including an x17 flare which was one of the largest solar flares since 1976 @xcite .",
    "this flare was detected beginning at 9:51  ut on october 28 , 2003 ( day 301 ) and peaked at 11:10  ut the same day .",
    "this flare had an associated cme with a transit time from the sun to the earth of only 19 hours , making it one of the the fastest on record .",
    "the shock from the cme impacted the earth s magnetic field as a strong sudden impulse ( an abrupt increase in the horizontal component of the geomagnetic field ) at 6:13 ut on october 29 , 2003 ( day 301 ) @xcite .",
    "this cme caused a drop in the counting rate of ground - based cosmic ray detectors .",
    "the counting rate for neutron monitor stations remained suppressed for roughly twelve days after the impact of the shock .",
    "project grand @xcite , an extensive air shower array of proportional wire chambers , is a useful tool for studying the ground - level effects of cosmic rays .",
    "grand s median energy for vertically incident cosmic rays is 56 gev , higher than that for neutron monitors .",
    "this allows grand to complement neutron monitor data by studying higher energy effects .",
    "grand has an angular resolution of @xmath0 on a projected plane for incoming muon tracks .",
    "the angular resolution , primary energy sensitivity , and large detector area of this experiment ( 82  @xmath1 ) make it an excellent instrument to to study forbush decreases .",
    "secondary muon data obtained by grand during the time of the october 29 forbush decrease are discussed .",
    "in addition , a simple model for a cme ejecta is proposed and some of the consequences of this model are discussed .",
    "project grand is located at @xmath2 n and @xmath3 w at 220 meters above sea level .",
    "its array of 64 proportional wire chamber stations are arranged in a 8 @xmath4 8 grid that covers 100  m @xmath4 100  m. each station contains four pairs of wire chamber planes .",
    "each pair has a top plane with wires running north / south and a bottom plane with wires running east / west .",
    "each plane contains 80 wire cells with a total active area of 1.29  @xmath1 .",
    "the pairs of planes are placed vertically above one another , with a separation of 197  mm between pairs .",
    "there is a 51  mm steel plate above the bottom pair of planes , allowing muons to be differentiated from electrons ( which scatter , shower , or stop in the steel ) .",
    "the angle of the incoming tracks is determined from the difference between the location of the wires hit on the top plane and the bottom plane .",
    "the stations have a maximum sensitivity for vertical tracks and a cutoff of @xmath5 from vertical in each projected plane due to the size and separation of the planes .",
    "grand runs with two triggers : 1 ) single tracks from individual stations and 2 ) multiple stations in time coincidence .",
    "the data presented in this paper comes solely from trigger ( 1 ) analyzed for those single tracks which are identified as muons .",
    "the monte - carlo program fluka @xcite,@xcite was used to simulate primary protons in the atmosphere for energies of interest ( 1  -   3000  gev ) .",
    "the results of these simulations were originally shown in @xcite for primary protons and @xcite for primary gamma rays .",
    "the results of the number of muons reaching ground level per proton of a given primary energy are shown in figure [ flukafig ] .",
    "protons were used for this simulation because the majority of the primaries which generate ground level muon counting rates are protons    the response of grand to background cosmic rays can be determined by using the results from the fluka simulation and folding it with the cosmic ray spectrum at those angles .",
    "a primary spectrum of    @xmath6    was used @xcite and is shown in figure [ primary ] . the combined response to vertical primary protons is shown in figure [ response ] , showing grand s median primary rigidity at 56 gv .",
    "further information on the response function and operation of project grand is available from @xcite , @xcite , and references therein .",
    "the muon data rate for october 29 and 30 , 2003 is shown in figure [ grand ] .",
    "grand s data rate shows a decrease of 8% from the counting rate prior to the decrease .",
    "data following the forbush decrease show that it takes grand nine days to recover to its original counting rate .    in order to ensure that the data reflected only physical variations ,",
    "a cut was performed to select only the best stations for analysis for this event .",
    "the r.m.s .",
    "deviation was calculated for each of the stations and compared to the expected statistical fluctuation ( the square root of the mean number of counts ) .",
    "all stations with a ratio higher than 8.0 were eliminated from this analysis , leaving 17 stations .",
    "angular information for the muons was also analyzed during october 29 and october 30 .",
    "the average angles in the north / south direction and the east / west direction were calculated and are shown in figure [ angle ] . while the east / west direction shows little change in activity above statistics , the north / south angle shows a swing where more particles originate from the north during the time of the forbush decrease . since a forbush decrease is caused by a large solar coronal ejection whose magnetic field deflects the incoming cosmic ray particles when it impacts the earth , it should be expected that this causes a deficiency in particles from a particular direction .    the magnetic field near the earth",
    "was also studied @xcite during the time of this event and is shown in figure [ forbushace ] .",
    "the magnetic field shows an increase during the time of the decrease which maintained for a day following the impact .",
    "this is consistent with a large coronal mass ejection with its own magnetic field interacting with the earth s magnetic field at the time of impact .",
    "this increased magnetic field can result in a higher cutoff rigidity for cosmic rays near the earth , resulting in a decrease in the counting rate as seen from the ground .",
    "decreases in cosmic - ray intensity in coincidence with changes in the magnitude of the horizontal component of the geomagnetic field ( the component of the magnetic field parallel to the earth ) were first noticed by scott forbush in the 1930s .",
    "@xcite stated that the sun would occasionally emit magnetized plasma from active regions .",
    "these clouds would affect the cosmic - ray rate in interplanetary space and produce magnetic storms on the earth .",
    "satellites were able to detect changes in the rate of cosmic rays ( along with a simultaneous increase in magnetic field strength ) in interplanetary space in 1959 and 1960 confirming this hypothesis @xcite .",
    "these magnetic clouds have been identified as the ejecta from coronal mass ejections on the sun . in order to properly understand the mechanisms of forbush",
    "decreases it is necessary to study the propagation of ejecta in the solar wind @xcite .",
    "cmes often originate in the solar corona near magnetic field lines and typically follow a coronal helmet streamer @xcite .",
    "this streamer gets distorted and is finally disrupted by the expanding closed field region underneath it .",
    "the cme speed is typically between 20 and 2000 km / s and have an average speed of 400 km / s @xcite which is greater than the typical solar wind speed from the sun .",
    "when the fast ejecta meets with the slower solar wind , a shock is created @xcite . it should be noted that while cmes and flares often are associated , one is not necessary for the other .",
    "a simple model for the propagation of the ejecta generated by a cme is presented here . with a given initial radius and magnetic field near the surface of the sun , the intended goals are to determine how it propagates through the solar system , the time of flight from the sun to the earth , the magnetic field of the ejecta when it reaches the earth , and the extent of the ejecta at earth .",
    "the information on the size and magnetic field will be used to evaluate the prospect that high energy cosmic rays may be occluded by the material .",
    "the model presented here is a simple model that assumes a bulk size , shape , pressure , and magnetic field",
    ". this may not be the case if the structure created during the formation of the cme is maintained .",
    "the model , however , is adequate for determining scale values for the magnetic field and size of the ejecta when it impacts the earth .",
    "the first assumption is that it is the solar wind which is responsible for convecting the cme material to the earth and therefore the flight time for the cme ejecta is connected to the solar wind .",
    "any relative motion between the cme ejecta and the solar wind would dissipate as a shock or pressure fluctuation .",
    "the time scale for the solar wind to travel from the sun to the earth and the time scale of a cme ejecta transit are quite similar , positing a relationship between the two which is explored further in section 5 .    in order to construct a simple model ,",
    "it is necessary to know the properties of the solar wind as it propagates from the sun to the earth .",
    "pressure balance between the solar wind and the cme ejecta is then used to determine the properties of the cme ejecta as they flow toward the earth .",
    "the results of a calculation of solar wind velocity and temperature with respect to distance from the sun are given in @xcite , shown here as figure [ axpic ] .",
    "for the purposes of discussion in this work only the damped waves will be considered ( dotted lines ) .",
    "these values of @xmath7 and @xmath8 from figure [ axpic ] are then used to determine the density of the solar wind at a given distance from the sun using a few basic principles .",
    "we assume that the mass of the wind is constant as it expands and that its expansion is spherically symmetric :    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the distance from the sun , @xmath7 is the velocity of the solar wind , and @xmath11 is the density of the solar wind .",
    "also it is assumed that the wind and cme follow the ideal gas law .",
    "the mass continuity equation is used to derive an equation for the density based on initial conditions :    @xmath12    @xmath13    this equation for density is then used to determine the density of the wind at all distances given the velocity of the solar wind and the distance from the sun . @xcite",
    "gives @xmath14 of @xmath15 particles/@xmath16 and a @xmath17 of 3.3@xmath18  cm / s at a @xmath19=6.96@xmath20  cm ( one solar radius ) .",
    "the pressure of the solar wind will be important in determining the size of the cme as it propagates through the solar system .",
    "the total pressure of the cme is balanced by the pressure of the solar wind .",
    "as the pressure due to the solar wind decreases , the cme expands . in this case",
    "we assume that the solar wind behaves like an ideal gas .",
    "we use @xmath21 to represent the effective mass . from the ideal gas law ,",
    "the gas pressure of the solar wind is @xmath22 .",
    "there is also a contribution to the pressure in the solar wind from the interplanetary magnetic field , making the total pressure due to the solar wind ( in cgs units ) :    @xmath23    the values for @xmath11 can be found in equation ( [ densityeq ] ) and the values for @xmath8 are those from @xcite . the values for @xmath24 assume a parker spiral @xcite which has the form of @xmath25 .",
    "a value of 7  nt is used for @xmath26 at a distance @xmath27 .",
    "this value is a mean value of the magnitude of the imf as recorded by ace on october 27 , 2003 @xcite .",
    "the initial density of the solar wind at the sun was given in @xcite .",
    "since @xmath11 can be found at all distances , @xmath10 , and since @xmath8 can be read from figure [ axpic ] , @xmath28 can be determined at all distances , @xmath10 .    in order to maintain dynamical equilibrium at each radius , the pressure of the cme ejecta continually adjusts to match that of the ambient solar wind .",
    "the cme ejecta has contributions to the pressure from magnetic pressure and gas pressure .",
    "the adiabatic equation is assumed and gives the gas pressure of the cme , @xmath29 :    @xmath30    the development of @xmath31 is determined by the geometry of the cme and is dependent on its formation in the solar corona and the structure of the magnetic field within it .",
    "typically the cme structure can be complex , for example the structure given in @xcite is a cme with a three - part structure , the center of which is typically an erupted solar prominence .",
    "this is surrounded by a cavity which is , in turn , surrounded by a leading plasma loop .",
    "this gives a cme structure which is a magnetic field embedding a magnetic flux rope which originates at the base near the corona .",
    "if the height of the eruption is similar to the width of the loop of the magnetic field lines , the cme will have a mostly spherical structure . if the height of the prominence is larger than the radius of the magnetic field loop then the structure of the cme will be more cylindrical in nature .",
    "both geometries are explored below .    for a cme with",
    "spherical geometry , the continuity equation is @xmath32 . for a cme with cylindrical geometry ,",
    "the continuity equation changes to @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the radius of the cme ejecta .",
    "we are assuming here that cylindrical cme ejecta might arise from an arcade flare - like structure .",
    "in general , the spherical and cylindrical geometries represent two structural extremes and we can also envision an intermediate case with @xmath35 with @xmath36 . for this work we used @xmath37.we explore the spherical ( denoted sph . ) , cylindrical ( denoted cyl . ) , and intermediate ( denoted int . ) cases below . substituting these relationships into the pressure equation above",
    ", we get the development of the gas pressure of the cme with respect to radius .",
    "@xmath38    conservation of magnetic flux in the cme ejecta requires that    @xmath39    combining that with the magnetic pressure and substituting this into the magnetic pressure equation gives ,    @xmath40    as a result , assuming that the cme ejecta are in pressure balance with the ambient solar wind as they propagate toward earth , we get :    @xmath41    [ completeeqns ]    the initial radius is based on the final reported radius for the october 28 , 2003 cme @xcite which was @xmath42 .",
    "the initial magnetic field of 1.0  g is a typical field at that distance from the sun and was chosen based on estimates made in @xcite .",
    "the results were also determined for magnetic fields of 0.3 and 3.0 gauss .",
    "this range of an order of magnitude in initial magnetic field gives information on initial magnetic pressure for the cme over the range of two orders of magnitude .",
    "@xmath43 was obtained by solving each of the equations shown in equation ( [ completeeqns ] ) using initial conditions and @xmath44 .",
    "finally , @xmath34 , the size of the cme ejecta , was solved numerically for different values of solar wind pressure and temperature ( effectively solving for @xmath34 as a function of distance from the sun ) .",
    "once that is done , equation ( [ mag ] ) can be used to solve for the magnetic field as a function of radius .",
    "the flight time of the cme to reach one au was calculated and is independent of the geometry . the flight time predicted by the model was 54 hours .",
    "the typical values for cme speeds range from 20 - 2000 km / s @xcite which correspond to flight times from 21 hours to 86 days .",
    "the predicted flight time falls within this range .",
    "the measured time of flight was 19 hours .",
    "the radial extent of the cme at 1 au was determined for all three geometrical cases and for a range of magnetic fields .",
    "if an initial magnetic field of 1.0  g is used , the spherical situation gives a cme with a radius of 1.9  au and the cylindrical cme has a radius of 0.60  au and the intermediate geometry cme has a radius of 0.98  au .",
    "the speed of the solar wind near the earth as reported by ace @xcite during the event ( 5:00 - 19:00  ut ) was used to determine the size of the cme .",
    "this gives a cme size of 0.54  au .",
    "the progression of the radial size as a function of distance from the sun for all three geometries is shown in figure [ modelr ] .",
    "figure [ cylex ] shows the radius as a function of distance for the cylindrical geometry for all three inital magnetic field strengths .",
    "the magnetic field of the cme was also calculated at various points between the sun and the earth .",
    "these are shown in figure [ modelb ] .",
    "given an initial magnetic field of 1  g , the cylindrical case gives a mean magnetic field of 250  nt at 1 au while the spherical case shows a mean field of 24  nt and the intermediate case gives a mean field of 90  nt .",
    "the range in magnetic field for the cme at 1 au is between 6.9 and 160  nt for the spherical case while the cylindrical model yields a range between 110 and 310  nt and the intermediate model gives a range from 28 to 280  nt .",
    "data from ace show that the imf fluctuates during this storm between 20 and 60  nt @xcite .",
    "figure [ sphex ] shows the progression of the magnetic field for the spherical model given the three different initial magnetic fields .",
    "a summary of the results for all three models and all initial magnetic fields is shown in table [ table ] .",
    "the three models presented here provide a parameter range that agrees with the data for this event .",
    "given the simplicity of this model , an exact fit was not expected .",
    "the spherical model gives a value for the magnetic field of the cme at earth that is consistent with that observed during the forbush decrease of october 29 , 2003 where the cylindrical model gives a value for the cme radius more consistent with the data .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the cme observed is from one of the largest flares on record and is most likely different from a  typical \" cme .",
    "this model is adequate if used as a scaling argument .",
    "if it is assumed that grand s drop of 8% in its counting rate is caused by an increased magnetic field which prohibits lower energy primaries from reaching the earth , the minimum energy primaries observed by grand during the decrease can be determined . eliminating the lower",
    "8% of grand s cosmic rays leaves primaries with energies above 10  gev . given @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is effectively the energy of a charged particle , b is the magnetic field , and @xmath47 is the gyroradius for a particle in that field",
    ", a 10  gev particle in a 24  nt field has a gyroradius of 0.0087  au , larger than the earth s radius and much smaller than the size of the cme .",
    "this implies that a magnetic field of the size and strength calculated is strong enough to have an effect on grand s counting rate .",
    "project grand sees an 8% drop in its secondary muon counting rate during the forbush decrease of october 29 , 2003 .",
    "a shift is also observed in the mean angle of incident muons in the north - south plane .",
    "a simple model for the propagation of a cme through the solar system is presented . within a range of initial conditions for the cme ,",
    "the model is consistent with satellite observations near earth during the october 29 , 2003 storm .",
