    "the _ unintegrated _ parton distributions ( upd s ) have been considered in numerous works on applications of perturbative qcd @xcite .",
    "these distributions are generalizations of the usual integrated parton distributions ( pd ) , and in some sense more basic objects , as pd s are obtained from upd s by integration over the transverse momentum of the parton .",
    "the notion of upd s relies on the @xmath9-factorization , and , in the spirit of the ccfm equations @xcite , introduces two scales : the probing scale , @xmath10 , and the transverse - momentum scale , @xmath9 .",
    "recently , the upd gained substantial attention , since they enter many exclusive physical processes , such as the production of the higgs boson @xcite , the @xmath11 boson @xcite , heavy flavors @xcite , the jet production @xcite , particle production @xcite , or hadron production in relativistic heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "the unintegrated distributions were also used in studies of the longitudinal @xcite , charmed @xcite , and spin @xcite structure functions of the nucleon , as well as analyzed in the dipole picture of qcd @xcite .",
    "the upd s , similarly to other entities in qcd , undergo evolution with the change of the probing scale @xmath10 .",
    "the philosophy adopted here is similar to the case of the integrated pd . at some initial scale @xmath12",
    "we need to know the non - perturbative quantity from measurements , models , or lattice calculations , and then we can evolve it to a different scale @xmath10 with the help of suitable qcd evolution equations . in the case of integrated pd",
    "we need to assume the dependence of pd on the bjorken @xmath13 variable at the initial scale @xmath12 . for the upd we need to know in addition the dependence on the transverse momentum , @xmath9 , or , equivalently , the transverse coordinate @xmath0 , which is the variable fourier - conjugated to @xmath9 . knowing this , we compute , with no extra physical input apart for the assumptions entering the qcd evolution , the unintegrated distribution at the final scale @xmath10 .",
    "important physics questions may be answered . in particular , the upd evolve in such a way that the average transverse - momentum increases in a specified way with the scale @xcite .",
    "this spreading can be studied quantitatively within the approach .",
    "this constrains the freedom in phenomenological analyses of processes involving the upd s .    in his studies of the problem ,",
    "kwieciski started from the ccfm formalism @xcite , which explicitly involves two separate scales : the probing scale , @xmath10 , and the transverse momentum of the parton , @xmath9 .",
    "the ccfm equations were subsequently extended to include the quarks , as well as reduced to the single - loop approximation .",
    "in addition , the non - sudakov form factor was dropped .",
    "kwieciski found that in this approximation the equations diagonalize in the space fourier - conjugated to the transverse momentum , where they assume a particularly simple and elegant form in a close resemblance of the dglap @xcite equations for the integrated pd .",
    "the only , but most important , difference is the appearance of the bessel function @xmath14 in the evolution kernel .",
    "thus , the evolution depends on the transverse coordinate @xmath0 . in the original work of ref .",
    "@xcite these equations were called `` the ccfm equations for the upd in the transverse - coordinate space in the single - loop approximation '' . due to numerous steps leading away from the original ccfm",
    ", we find it more appropriate to call the equations of refs .",
    "@xcite _ the kwieciski equations for the upd evolution_. since in the case of integrated pd these equations reduce to the usual lo dglap , the range of applicability of the kwieciski equations is not larger as for the lo dglap , with not too small and not too large values of the bjorken @xmath13 variable .",
    "formally , the kwieciski equations are integro - differential equations with the kernel depending on the transverse coordinate @xmath0 ( _ cf .",
    "[ sec : keq ] ) . as such",
    ", they are not trivial to solve numerically .",
    "the method of the original works @xcite involved the chebyshev interpolation in the @xmath13 and @xmath10 spaces for each value of @xmath0 . in this paper",
    "we offer an alternative method , based on the evolution of the @xmath13-moments of upd . in the moment ( mellin ) space , the evolution equations become a set of ordinary differential equations , which can be solved numerically in a very efficient way ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : keqmel ] ) .",
    "we derive analytic expressions for the @xmath0-dependent anomalous dimensions , which can be written in terms of hypergeometric functions .",
    "then , the inverse mellin transform to the original @xmath13-space is performed via numerical integration with oscillatory functions .",
    "we show that the procedure is fast and stable , providing a useful numerical tool for evolving the upd .",
    "the mellin - transform method allows us to carry analytic considerations , such as studies of certain limits of the equations , specifically the cases of low and and large @xmath0 , and @xmath13 approaching the endpoints .",
    "we pursue these considerations , which can be done since the form of the @xmath0-dependent anomalous dimensions is analytic .",
    "in addition to developing a different numerical method ( sec .  [ sec : keqmel ] ) , our study differs from ref .",
    "@xcite in two physical aspects .",
    "firstly , rather than guessing the initial shape in @xmath0 , we use the results of low - energy chiral quark models ( sec .",
    "[ sec : init ] ) .",
    "we consider two models : the recently proposed spectral quark model of ref .",
    "@xcite and the nambu  jona - lasinio model with the pauli villars regularization @xcite .",
    "these models were used before to describe the integrated pd @xcite , and were shown to do a surprisingly good job , in particular for the valence distribution in the pion .",
    "they were also used to describe successfully other aspect of high - energy processes , such as the pion distribution amplitude @xcite and generalized ( off - forward ) pd of the pion @xcite .",
    "the models give the initial condition at the model scale @xmath12 in a particularly simple , factorized form .",
    "the valence quarks are distributed uniformly in @xmath13 , while the gluons and the sea quarks vanish .",
    "the @xmath0-dependence is a simple , analytic function with exponential fall - off at large @xmath0 .",
    "we stress that the @xmath0 dependence is a prediction of the model , rather than a mere guess , as is frequently made . secondly , our implementation of the evolution switches from three to four flavors above the charm - production threshold , customarily taken at @xmath15 .",
    "our numerical results are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : num ] , where we show the dependence of the upd s on @xmath13 and @xmath0 .",
    "since the analytic forms of the anomalous dimensions involve generalized hypergeometric functions , which may be cumbersome to program , we have developed a low-@xmath0 expansion ( sec .",
    "[ sec : lowb ] ) , which makes the calculations simpler when @xmath0 is not too large .",
    "the expansion is in powers of @xmath1 , and is fast and stable . for the opposite problem , where @xmath16 is large",
    ", we have obtained asymptotic expansions ( sec .",
    "[ largeb ] ) , which allow to deal numerically with the generalized hypergeometric functions .",
    "our method of solving the equations in the mellin space carries additional bonuses .",
    "in particular , it allows us for analytic considerations in the investigation of formal limits at @xmath5 ( sec .  [ sec : x1 ] ) and @xmath4 ( sec .  [ sec : x0 ] ) . at @xmath5",
    "we show that the @xmath0-dependent non - singlet distribution approaches very fast the integrated non - singlet distrtibution . at @xmath4",
    "we find generalizations of the double - leading - logarithm ( dlla ) formulas of ref .",
    "finally , we examine the large-@xmath0 behavior , where we show that the evolution - generated upd s from the kwieciski equations exhibit power - law behavior at large @xmath0 .",
    "the fall - off is much faster for the gluons than for the quarks .",
    "widening in the transverse momentum of all partonic distributions is confirmed .",
    "we show that @xmath8 grows with the probing scale as @xmath17 .",
    "we write an approximating formula for the width for each partonic species , which may be useful in practical applications with the pion ( sec .",
    "[ sec : kt ] ) . the widening effect becomes stronger and stronger as @xmath10 increases or @xmath13 decreases , and it is bigger for the gluons than for the non - singlet and singlet quarks ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : kt ] ) .    the numerical method of this paper , which is easy to program and numerically fast and efficient , can be used for other initial conditions as well , for instance for the grs @xcite parameterization of the pion or the grv parameterization @xcite , of the nucleon , supplied with a profile in the transverse coordinate , as originally studied in ref .",

    "then , the original ccfm equations were supplemented with the quarks , as well as reduced to the single - loop approximation .",
    "the latter approximation replaces the angular ordering of the emitted gluons with the ordering of their transverse momenta .",
    "in addition , the non - sudakov form factor was dropped .",

    "<S> the kwieciski equations for the qcd evolution of the unintegrated parton distributions in the transverse - coordinate space ( @xmath0 ) are analyzed with the help of the mellin - transform method . </S>",
    "<S> the equations are solved numerically in the general case , as well as in a small-@xmath0 expansion which converges fast for @xmath1 sufficiently small . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the asymptotic limit of large @xmath2 and show that the distributions generated by the evolution decrease with @xmath0 according to a power law . </S>",
    "<S> numerical results are presented for the pion distributions with a simple valence - like initial condition at the low scale , following from chiral large-@xmath3 quark models . </S>",
    "<S> we use two models : the spectral quark model and the nambu  jona - lasinio model . </S>",
    "<S> formal aspects of the equations , such as the analytic form of the @xmath0-dependent anomalous dimensions , their analytic structure , as well as the limits of unintegrated parton densities at @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and at large @xmath0 , are discussed in detail . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of spreading of the transverse momentum with the increasing scale is confirmed , with @xmath6 growing asymptotically as @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> approximate formulas for @xmath8 for each parton species is given , which may be used in practical applications . </S>"
