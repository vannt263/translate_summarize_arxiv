    "let @xmath9 be a dominant rational self - map of the complex projective plane  @xmath10 .",
    "a great deal of effort has gone into understanding how the ergodic theory of @xmath11 is governed by two numerical invariants , the first and second dynamical degrees @xmath12 and @xmath13 , of @xmath11 .",
    "the two cases @xmath14 and @xmath15 are well - studied , the former corresponding to `` predominantly repelling dynamics '' and the latter to `` predominantly saddle - type dynamics . ''",
    "the borderline case @xmath16 has received much less attention . in this paper",
    "we provide many examples of rational maps @xmath17 with @xmath18 that exhibit both repelling and saddle - type dynamics equally .    in order to situate and state our main results ,",
    "let us discuss what is and is not known in a bit more detail .",
    "if we write @xmath11 in homogeneous coordinates as @xmath19 $ ] , with the @xmath20 having no common factors of positive degree , then the common degree of the @xmath20 is called the _ algebraic degree _ @xmath21 .",
    "the _ first dynamical degree _ is then the asymptotic growth rate @xmath22 of the algebraic degrees .",
    "if @xmath23 for all @xmath24 then @xmath11 is said to be _ algebraically stable _ and we have @xmath25 .    the _ topological degree _ @xmath13 is the number of preimages @xmath26 of a generic point @xmath27 .",
    "it is well - behaved under iteration , satisfying @xmath28 , and thus is also called the _ second dynamical degree _ of @xmath11 .",
    "the basic ergodic theoretic invariant of @xmath11 is its topological entropy @xmath29 .",
    "gromov @xcite and dinh - sibony @xcite showed that entropy is controlled by the dynamical degrees .",
    "specifically , @xmath30 guedj @xcite and dinh - nguyen - truong @xcite , following briend and duval @xcite , showed further that when @xmath31 , the map @xmath11 has a unique invariant measure @xmath32 of maximal entropy @xmath33 , that @xmath32 is mixing and repelling ( both lyapunov exponents are positive ) , that repelling periodic points for @xmath11 are asymptotically equidistributed with respect to @xmath32 , and that @xmath32 does not charge small ( i.e. pluripolar ) sets .    on the other hand , work of diller - dujardin - guedj @xcite",
    "gives that when @xmath34 and certain additional technical hypotheses are satisfied , then @xmath11 has ( again ) a mixing invariant measure @xmath35 of maximal entropy @xmath36 .",
    "but in this case @xmath35 is of _ saddle _ type ( one lyapunov exponent is positive and the other is negative ) , and saddle periodic points for @xmath11 are asymptotically equidistributed with respect to  @xmath35 .",
    "uniqueness of the measure of maximal entropy when @xmath37 has been established only in special cases , notably for polynomial automorphisms of @xmath38 @xcite and for surface automorphisms @xcite .    almost nothing beyond the bound on topological entropy",
    "is known about the ergodic theory of rational maps with equal dynamical degrees @xmath16 .",
    "products @xmath39 of one dimensional maps @xmath40 in which one of the factors is linear furnish simple examples of plane rational maps with @xmath41 , and these suggest some possibilities for the ergodic theory .",
    "consider for example the rational maps @xmath42 , given on @xmath38 by @xmath43 each of these has @xmath44 .",

    "however , if one changes surface , compactifying @xmath38 by @xmath50 instead of @xmath10 , the resulting map @xmath51 acquires a second measure of maximal entropy @xmath35 given by normalized lebesgue measure on @xmath52 .",
    "the measure @xmath32 is repelling , while @xmath35 is of saddle type . finally , for each @xmath53 the map @xmath54 has normalized lebesgue measure on the unit circle @xmath55 as measure of maximal entropy within each vertical complex line @xmath56 .    of course , not all maps with equal dynamical degrees are products , but many non - product examples @xmath57 are still semiconjugate to rational maps @xmath58 via a some rational map @xmath59 .",
    "such maps are said to have ` invariant fibrations ' .",
    "they include @xcite all maps with @xmath60 ( i.e. all examples where @xmath11 is birational ) and examples @xcite that arise in connection with spectral theory for operators on self - similar spaces .",
    "based on this evidence , guedj asked whether any rational map with equal ( maximal ) dynamical degrees must preserve a fibration @xcite .",
    "however , examples were recently found by bedford - cantat - kim @xcite and kaschner - prez - roeder @xcite showing that this is not the case .",
    "the product examples @xmath61 defined above are each degenerate in another way .",
    "the ergodic measures of maximal entropy for these three maps are all supported in algebraic curves ( lines , in fact ) . since birational changes of coordinate can contract curves , such measures are not very robust .",
    "the measures obtained in @xcite and @xcite for ` cohomologically hyperbolic ' cases @xmath62 are much more diffuse ; in particular they do not charge algebraic curves .",
    "the main results of this paper show that there are large families of rational maps with equal dynamical degrees @xmath16 that admit exactly two measures of maximal entropy without any of the above problems .",
    "let @xmath57 be a rational map with equal algebraic and topological degrees @xmath63 .",
    "then there is an open subset of linear maps @xmath64 for which the map @xmath65 satisfies the following .",
    "* @xmath5 is algebraically stable and therefore has @xmath66 .",
    "* there is no @xmath5 invariant foliation ; in particular , @xmath5 is not rationally semiconjugate to a holomorphic self - map of a riemann surface .",

    "* @xmath5 is uniformly hyperbolic of saddle type on @xmath69 . *",
    "neither @xmath69 nor @xmath68 are contained in any algebraic curve . *",
    "any point @xmath70 whose forward images are not indeterminate for @xmath5 has a forward orbit asymptotic to either @xmath68 , @xmath69 or one of finitely many attracting periodic points .",
    "it is easy to find mappings @xmath11 satisfying the hypothesis of theorem  a. for example , suppose @xmath71 is an endomorphism and @xmath72 is a birational map , both of algebraic degree @xmath73 .",
    "then , @xmath74 has @xmath75 .",
    "the subset of @xmath8 from theorem a is open with respect to the metric topology on @xmath8 , not the zariski topology .",
    "( in fact , we will never use the zariski topology in this paper . )",
    "therefore , we do not know whether there might be different , but also fairly robust possibilities for the ergodic theory of a rational map with equal degrees .",
    "are there for instance , large families of such maps with exactly one measure of maximal entropy ?",
    "more than two ?",
    "however each of the first two conclusions of theorem a are obtained by ( essentially ) verifying that @xmath7 can be chosen to avoid countably many algebraic coincidences .",
    "so once the conclusions hold for one @xmath7 , they apply ` generically . '",
    "this is the content of the next result , which answers a question posed to us by charles favre .",
    "let @xmath57 be a rational map with equal algebraic and topological degrees @xmath63 .",
    "then for all @xmath76 outside a countable union of proper algebraic subsets ,    * @xmath5 is algebraically stable , with @xmath77 .",
    "* there is no @xmath5 invariant foliation .",
    "the connection between dynamical degrees and ergodic theory extends to the much more general context of meromorphic self - maps on compact khler manifolds of any dimension .",
    "the reader may consult  @xcite to gain a good sense of the larger picture , much of which is still conjectural .",
    "however , a recent paper of vigny  @xcite validates this picture for `` generic cohomologically hyperbolic rational maps '' of @xmath78 .",
    "some necessary background on the dynamics of rational maps is presented in   [ sec_ref ] .  [ sec_proofs ]",
    "gives the proofs of theorems a and b. the main techniques that we use are hyperbolic dynamics , elementary geometry of algebraic curves , and an application of theorem 4.1 from @xcite .",
    "one can obtain some ( though not nearly all ) of the conclusions of theorem a with less exertion by appealing to work of de thlin and vigny ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1 ) . in order to keep the discussion more",
    "self - contained , we do not take this route here .",
    "given a rational map @xmath57 with equal degrees @xmath79 , one can in principle use our arguments for theorem a to identify a specific linear transformation @xmath76 for which @xmath5 satisfies all conclusions of the theorem . in practice",
    "however , it seems a bit daunting to arrange everything we need from @xmath7 to make the theorem work .",
    "hence in the final section  [ sec_perturbed_chebyshev ] of this paper , we consider a family of rational maps @xmath80 that depend on a single real parameter @xmath81 $ ] and for which symmetry considerations allow us to verify the conclusions of theorem a more directly .",
    "the initial map @xmath82 is closely related to the one variable quadratic chebyshev map .",
    "we show that the conclusions of theorem a hold for all @xmath83 $ ] close enough to @xmath46 .",
    "an interesting additional outcome is that for all such  @xmath84 , the measure @xmath32 is real , supported on @xmath85 , whereas the measure @xmath35 is not .",
    "throughout this paper @xmath10 will denote the complex projective plane .",
    "unless otherwise specified , we will measure distance between points with the usual fubini - study metric , normalized so that @xmath10 has unit volume .",
    "for any set @xmath86 and @xmath87 , we let @xmath88 be the @xmath89-neighborhood of @xmath90 .",

    "@xmath11 is given by @xmath19 $ ] , where the components @xmath91 $ ] are homogeneous polynomials , all of the same degree @xmath92 and with no non - constant common factors .",
    "the common zeroes of the components @xmath93 correspond to a finite set @xmath94 on which @xmath11 is not definable as a continuous map .",
    "on @xmath95 , the map @xmath11 is well - defined and holomorphic .",
    "we define the  image \" of a point @xmath96 to be the set @xmath97 of all possible limits @xmath98 .",
    "this is always a non - trivial algebraic curve .",
    "note that here and in the rest of the paper , algebraic curves are allowed to be reducible unless otherwise noted .",
    "we assume throughout that @xmath11 is _ dominant _ , meaning that @xmath99 is not contained in an algebraic curve .",
    "we define the ` image ' of an algebraic curve @xmath100 under @xmath11 to be its ( set - theoretic ) proper transform @xmath101 if @xmath102 is irreducible , then @xmath103 is either another irreducible algebraic curve or a point . for a rational map of @xmath10",
