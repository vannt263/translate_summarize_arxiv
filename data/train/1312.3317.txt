    "with the discovery  @xcite last year of a new resonance , whose properties so far show no deviations from those of the long sought - after higgs boson , a new era started in the understanding of the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics . in the absence of any evidence for any other new degree of freedom at the weak scale ,",
    "a mass gap is likely to separate the sm particles from the dynamics generating and stabilizing the higgs potential .",
    "our ignorance about the new physics sector can thus be conveniently parametrized in terms of a set of higher dimensional operators built out of sm fields obeying the sm symmetries . for a single family of fermions",
    ", there are 59 independent ways to deform the sm  @xcite .",
    "of particular interest are the 30 deformation directions affecting higgs physics  @xcite .",
    "actually , @xmath10 of them were already constrained at the per - mil / per cent level before the higgs discovery itself , thanks to electroweak measurements involving massive gauge bosons and bounds on quark and lepton dipole moments .",
    "the higgs data collected by atlas and cms ( as well as by the tevatron experiments ) start putting interesting bounds on the remaining 8 @xmath11-even and 2 @xmath11-odd directions  @xcite . in this regard ,",
    "a higgs mass around 125gev offers remarkable opportunities to probe these directions , since it opens numerous decay channels with a rate accessible with the current integrated luminosity delivered by the lhc .    among these operators , four are particularly important , since they control the main production mechanism of the higgs , namely gluon fusion .",
    "these are denotes the qcd gauge - field strength and @xmath12 its dual .",
    "@xmath13 is the qcd coupling strength .",
    "@xmath14 is the sm higgs doublet and @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the sm higgs vacuum expectation value related to the fermi constant by @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the sm top yukawa coupling , and finally @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the @xmath21 quark doublet and charge-2/3 quark singlet of the third generation . ]",
    "@xmath22 added to the sm as @xmath23 from this lagrangian we can extract the terms relevant to higgs production in gluon fusion , in @xmath24 and @xmath25 observables . ]",
    "@xmath26 where at linear order in the coefficients multiplying the operators in eq .",
    "we find @xmath27 the first two terms in eq .",
    "are invariant under @xmath11 , whereas the third and fourth terms violate @xmath11",
    ". we will be mainly interested in @xmath11-conserving effects , therefore we set @xmath28 in the following .",
    "we will however return briefly to the @xmath11-odd case later ( notice that since there is no interference between the @xmath11-even and -odd amplitudes for @xmath29 , the two cases can be discussed separately ) .",
    "the coefficient @xmath30 corrects the top yukawa coupling , which controls the top loop contribution to @xmath31 production , whereas the coefficient @xmath32 gives a direct contribution to this process .",
    "unfortunately , the lightness of the higgs boson plays a malicious role and makes it impossible to disentangle short- and long - distance contribution to the gluon fusion total rate .",
    "this limitation is embodied in the higgs low energy theorem  @xcite that ensures that the inclusive production cross section is proportional to @xmath33 .",
    "in fact , from eq .",
    "we readily obtain @xmath34 where in the second equality we neglected corrections that will remain untouchable at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "the only hope then to have a direct access to the top yukawa coupling is through the @xmath35 process , which is notoriously difficult due to its high threshold , its small rate and its complicated final state with copious decay products .",
    "exploratory studies concluded that the sensitivity in the measurement of the top yukawa coupling through the @xmath36 process will be limited to about 10% within the lhc high - luminosity program  @xcite and higgs factories like a 500-gev ilc or a 80/100-km tlep will be needed to bring this sensitivity down to a few per - cent level  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we propose an alternative way to break the degeneracy between the two coefficients @xmath30 and @xmath32 and thus to provide direct information on the top yukawa coupling .",
    "our idea relies on the use of extra radiation in the @xmath31 process that will allow us to explore the structure of the top loop .",
    "when the extra radiation carries away a large amount of energy and boosts the higgs boson , the process effectively probes the ultraviolet structure of the top loop .",
    "notice that the extra radiation can not be in the form of a photon , as the amplitude for @xmath37 vanishes due to furry s theorem .",
    "one is therefore led to consider the production of @xmath38 in association with a jet .",
    "is also interesting , despite being subleading with respect to the tree - level contribution from @xmath39 .",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite for very recent studies . ]    resolving the degeneracy between the two contributions to gluon - fusion higgs production is not a mere academic exercise .",
    "there exist some new physics scenarios whose identification is endangered by the limitation of the lhc to separately measure @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the prime examples are composite higgs models : the top sector is enlarged and encompasses extra heavy vector - like fermions that mix with the sm top quark .",
    "these top partners have a double effect to simultaneously shift the top yuakwa coupling and to also give rise to a contact interaction between the gluons and the higgs boson . as it was first noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite and later explored in refs .",
    "@xcite , these two effects precisely annihilate in the @xmath31 process in minimal ( and most popular ) models .",
    "another cancellation can occur in natural supersymmetric ( susy ) scenarios , when a large mixing between the stops conspires to nullify the total stop contribution to @xmath31 .",
    "even though this is a particular region in the susy parameter space , an accumulation of experimental hints might point to such a situation and some experimental ingenuity will be required to directly see the low - lying stops  @xcite .",
    "thus new physics might well be present in the data already collected at the lhc , while the measurements performed up to now remain blind to it .",
    "we advocate that the @xmath42 channel can be competitive or at least complementary with the more studied @xmath43 channel to unveil hidden new physics . for previous studies addressing",
    "the use of the higgs transverse momentum distribution as a handle on new physics , see for example refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : analysis ] we present our analysis of the @xmath44 process , by adopting an effective theory approach to describe the effects of heavy new physics . in order to obtain an estimate of the lhc potential to disentangle the current degeneracy in the plane of effective couplings , we focus on the promising channel where the higgs boson decays to two collimated tau leptons .",
    "section  [ sec : mchm ] studies the ability of the boosted higgs regime to probe the spectrum of top partners in composite higgs models , whereas section  [ sec : susy ] looks at the @xmath45 process as a way to probe light stops in supersymmetric extensions of the sm .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : conclusions ] collects our conclusions .",
    "we also include an appendix , where formulae for the @xmath46 cross section mediated by @xmath11-violating couplings are reported .",
    "at the parton level , three subprocesses contribute to the @xmath48 cross section : these are @xmath49 . by @xmath50 . ]",
    "the expressions of the sm matrix elements for @xmath51 and @xmath52 , mediated by quark loops , were first calculated at lo in qcd in ref .",

    "<S> the higgs production and decay rates offer a new way to probe new physics beyond the standard model . </S>",
    "<S> while dynamics aiming at alleviating the hierarchy problem generically predict deviations in the higgs rates , the current experimental analyses can not resolve the long- and short - distance contributions to the gluon fusion process and thus can not access directly the coupling between the higgs and the top quark . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the production of a boosted higgs in association with a high - transverse momentum jet as an alternative to the @xmath0 channel to pin down this crucial coupling . presented first in the context of an effective field theory , our analysis </S>",
