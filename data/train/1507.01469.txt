    "the varying _ cis_-fraction of dye with depth and time , @xmath120 , arises from penetration of a _",

    "sometimes this front is loosely called a bleaching wave or front , since the converted dye is not an effective absorber of the original colour of light when in the _ cis _ state .",
    "however this bleaching is reversible ( not chemical ) and is otherwise referred to as saturated absorption @xcite . the resulting curvature ( [ eq : curvature ] ) determined by @xmath64 is thus a function of time , non monotonic since @xmath40 depends on the spatial variation of @xmath121 .",
    "thus we have time dependent over - bend , and this is further complicated by ( a ) the flux driving the depletion front varies with @xmath74 , which results from the accumulation of curvature @xmath122 from @xmath123 to @xmath73 , and ( b ) development of angles @xmath124 giving eclipsing , the incident light being blocked from falling on the sheet at arc positions before that @xmath73 where @xmath125 .",

    "the latter is beer s law of exponential decay @xmath138 of light in an as - yet undepleted dye population .",
    "this 2nd condition needs careful reexamination after eclipsing when sheets start to be irradiated from the back face .",
    "we solve ( [ eq : a ] ) ( see @xcite ) for depletion front solutions and inject them into ( [ eq : curvature - a ] ) for @xmath139 .",

    "the sheet starts bending from an initially flat shape .",
    "one already sees overshoot at @xmath149 .",
    "the overshot section is now illuminated on what was the back face , while at least part of the sheet with @xmath150 is eclipsed .",
    "the maximum curvature is more or less in the middle of the sheet where it was most strongly bent before being eclipsed .",
    "after overshoot , parts with @xmath151 bend backward because of the reversed illumination , as can be seen in @xmath152 , while eclipsed parts unbend exponentially in time since they are in the dark .",
    "approach to the stationary state takes a long time , in terms of the fundamental time scale @xmath9 , because of the complex sequence of overshoots .",
    "[ fig : dynamics](b ) has @xmath93 , which is slightly less than the maximal value @xmath153 for @xmath60 . now strongest bending is closer to the fixed end , as expected from fig .",
    "[ fig : stationary shape ] for this @xmath154 .",
    "overshoot is not so extreme and the approach to stationarity is much quicker . for smaller @xmath154 , for instance 0.5 for this length @xmath90 ,",
    "overshoot still occurs , but only slightly , whereas for @xmath155 with this @xmath90 , it is lost .",
    "we have demonstrated that because the effective illumination is controlled by orientation , and at the same time drives orientation since it induces bend , the bending of photo - responsive sheets is subtle . to explore the qualitative behaviour that should arise , both in statics and in dynamics , a simple geometrically - inspired dependence of light penetration on angle of incidence is adopted .",
    "the other essential physical driver of this photo - mechanics is that conversion of the isomerising guest dye molecules to their excited state has to be considerable ( i ) to perturb the local structure of the glass and induce mechanical change , and ( ii ) to allow deep penetration ( via a front of depletion of the ground state species ) so that bend can actually occur .",
    "we then find :    * photo - stationary shapes arising are qualitatively different according to whether the intensity of illumination normally incident is more or less than a characteristic value that depends on both a material constant and on the thickness of the sheet reduced by the beer length for adsorption .",
    "these stationary states can not be self - eclipsing .",
    "* seminal experiments on nematic glass bend response did display self - eclipsing as response proceeded . by analysing the dynamical evolution of the mechanics ,",
    "we show that this must have arisen as a transient effect and , accordingly , must be impossible to explain with just linear , lambert - beer , light absorption .",
    "we further predict that the route to the final photo - stationary state must show partial unbending via back bend , and could display multiple eclipses .",
    "the two regimes both suggest further experiments which should also give insight into how complex the true angular dependence of absorption is .",
    "for example the experiments of ikeda and yu @xcite could be illuminated for longer , such that appreciable backbend ( in addition to eclipsing ) is observed . eclipsing itself",
    "depends quite crucially on the length of the photo - responsive sheets , therefore repeating the experiments of ikeda and yu with different sample lengths should also reveal a complicated behaviour .",
    "perhaps most simple of all would be to coat the back face of the sheet with a reflective coating , thus removing effects from illuminating the back surface and allowing one to focus entirely on front - surface illumination and eclipsing .",
