    "dark matter stars are modelled in our work as a free or self - interacting fermion gas at zero temperature .",
    "the possible candidates for dark matter particles are a type of fermion predicted in extensions of the standard model including supersymmetric particles , the neutralino , the gravitino and the axino @xcite . in our discussion",
    ", we consider dark matter to be made of fermionic particles with a mass of 100 gev , the classical wimp mass scale .",
    "we assume that the dark matter particles can not self - annihilate as in asymmetric dark matter ( adm ) @xcite .",
    "self - annihilating wimp dark matter with masses above a few gev accreted onto neutron stars may trigger a conversion of most of the star into a strange star @xcite or the accreted dark matter may significantly affect the kinematical properties of the compact star @xcite .",
    "constraints on the properties of dark matter candidates can be obtained from stars which can accrete asymmetric dark matter in its lifetime and then collapse into a neutron star @xcite .",
    "constraints on the mass of dark matter candidates can also be obtained by the possible collapse of compact stars due to dark matter accretion @xcite .",
    "the cooling process of compact objects can be affected by the capture of dark matter which can annihilate the star @xcite .",
    "recent studies have been done to explore compact stars with non self - annihilating dark matter to analyze the gravitational effects of dark matter on the stellar matter under intense conditions @xcite . in these studies , masses of dark matter in the gev range has been assumed .",
    "studies have also been performed to investigate the compact objects formed due the admixture of neutron star matter and dark matter @xcite leading to the possibilities for new stable solutions of compact stars with planet like masses . to study of the effect of dark matter on compact objects is therefore of great interest .",
    "if quark stars do exist in nature , they can also accumulate dark matter and hence their properties might change .",
    "this accumulation will lead to various changes in the mass - radius relation of a quark star which is studied in this work .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : in section 2 , we shortly discuss about the two fluid tov equations . in section 3 , we discuss the equations of state for both quark matter and fermionic dark matter and discuss the general scaling solutions for these stars . in section 4 , we present the numerically obtained results ( mass - radius relations ) for quark matter stars by solving the tov equations . in section 5 ,",
    "tov equations are solved for dark matter composed of both strongly self - interacting and free fermions and their corresponding mass - radius relations are obtained .",
    "section 6 is dedicated to the numerical solutions of two fluid tov equations namely , dark matter and quark matter which are coupled together only by gravity .",
    "we demonstrate that the maximum mass of the quark star admixed with dark matter reduces due to the presence of dark matter and decreases in a linear fashion in case in strongly self - interacting dark matter fermions while for free dark matter , the maximum mass remains almost unaffected . finally , in section 7 , we summarize our findings and discuss our results .    throughout the paper ,",

    "we could separate out the hydrostatic equilibrium condition for the two stars into equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) because the interaction acts only through gravity and nothing else .",
    "the gravitational interaction is taken into account because of the fact that the mass that is considered in the equation _",
    "m(r ) _ is the total mass of both the fluids at radius _",

    "<S> compact stars consisting of massless quark matter and fermionic dark matter are studied by solving the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equations for two fluids separately . </S>",
    "<S> dark matter is further investigated by incorporating inter - fermionic interactions among the dark matter particles . </S>",
    "<S> the properties of stars made of quark matter particles and self - interacting and free dark matter particles are explored by obtaining their mass - radius relations . </S>",
    "<S> the regions of stability for such a compact star are determined and it is demonstrated that the maximum stable total mass of such a star decreases approximately linearly with increasing dark matter fraction . </S>"
