    "the impact of shot noise can be reduced , but not indefinitely : the resources available may be limited , and excessive amounts of power may start introducing additional sources of noise . even under optimal conditions for the control of thermal effects ,",
    "the radiation pressure of the intense field inevitably impinges on the measurement system .",
    "as the shot noise performance is improved by increasing power , the quantum radiation pressure noises places a new limit on the measurement .",
    "the trade - off between shot noise and radiation pressure noise is a manifestation of the  standard quantum limit \" ( sql )  @xcite .",
    "it is this issue that will pose a problem to long - baseline interferometric gravitational - wave sensors  @xcite in the near future .",

    "the current procedure employs phase - squeezed light , which is effective against the photon shot noise at higher frequencies .",
    "this is optimal provided the laser power is not high enough to cause radiation pressure noise at low frequencies  @xcite .",
    "the next generation of gravitational wave detectors will have high enough laser power to generate significant quantum radiation pressure at low frequencies , and their sensitivity would be enhanced by a phase - squeezed state due to excess noise of its amplitude quadrature .",
    "it is well known that quantum radiation pressure noise and photon shot noise can be simultaneously suppressed if the squeezing angle is frequency dependant , with amplitude squeezing to reduce radiation pressure noise at low frequencies and phase squeezing at higher frequencies to reduce shot noise  @xcite .",
    "broadband enhancement would thus be achieved when the squeezed angle rotates by @xmath0 over frequencies around the point of optimal sensitivity for gravitational waves , which is approximately @xmath1 .",

    "technical impediments such as decoherence and degradation can impact the effectiveness of this method  @xcite , and cavity losses represent the most significant limitation : to achieve the necessary storage time , the length of the resonators would need to be between a few tens of meters and the entire length of the interferometer arms  @xcite .",

    "we aim to extend the set of tools available to gravitational - wave detectors by exploring the effects of injecting squeezing generated by an optomechanical system  @xcite into the system .",
    "quadrature rotation naturally occurs in optomechanical squeezing due to the dispersive nature of the interaction between light and mechanics .",
    "appropriate tuning of the optomechanical cavity could make this rotation proximate to the one required for ideal interferometric measurements , providing an alternative to filter cavities and fixed - angle squeezing injection .",

    "the crucial element for the generation of squeezed states is a source of field non - linearity that introduces cross - correlations between different noise quadratures , opening up the opportunity to transfer the uncertainty of one onto the other .",
    "typically , the non - linear optical interaction is obtained through optical parametric oscillator ( opo ) crystals , whose refractive index depends on the intensity of the field traversing the material .",
    "cavity optomechanics presents an alternative method to generate analogous non - linear effects thanks to the mutual dependence of the intensity of the intra - cavity field and the relative position of the end mirrors of the cavity .    assuming a linear optical cavity with one fixed input mirror and the other end mirror oscillating at a mechanical frequency @xmath2 , the hamiltonian describing the system is @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the operators of the optical mode within the cavity , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the position and momentum operators of the moving mirror and @xmath8 is its mass . the resonance frequency of the cavity @xmath9 can be expanded in terms of the mirror position to make the optomechanical interaction explicit . to linear orders in @xmath6 , ignoring the constant terms and the contribution of the vacuum to the interaction ,",

    "the equations of motions are non - linear , and before looking at the quadratures of the optical field we will need to transform the variables and consider their fluctuation terms .",

    "[ eqn : bistability condition ] is that , for a parameter regime which allows the quadratic @xmath29 to attain negative values , more than one solution is possible .",
    "this arises from the fact that for high coupling strengths ( or high powers ) the thrust of radiation pressure force pushes the mirror enough to detune the cavity outside of its linewidth , even during the build - up of the intra - cavity field .",
    "the asymmetry of the ponderomotive detuning skews the common intensity profile of the cavity response , creating a region where two stable ( and one unstable ) solutions are possible .    to look at the dynamics of small fluctuations we consider perturbation of the variables around their corresponding steady states : @xmath30 the non - vanishing correlations of the optical input modes , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , increase with the mean thermal occupation of the photons @xmath33 . as we consider coherent states satisfying @xmath34 , we can validly approximate @xmath35 . for the thermal drive of the mechanical oscillator",

    "the thermal spectrum @xmath37 can be approximated to @xmath38 when the thermal phonon occupation number is @xmath39 at high temperatures .",
    "note that the main noise contribution for the system , coming from thermal fluctuations , is directly proportional to the temperature but inversely proportional to the mechanical quality factor . in terms of the thermal noise ,",
    "having the oscillator at a specific temperature is equivalent to having a better oscillator at higher temperature , and it is ultimately the ratio @xmath40 that determines the coherence of the system and the squeezing attainable . even though extremely high mechanical quality factors have been reported at room temperature  @xcite , lower temperatures are still appealing as they allow a relaxation of the requirements on the oscillator .",
    "after the expansion in terms of the fluctuation variables , we can identify two main interaction terms : one is linear in @xmath41 and proportional to the complex field amplitude @xmath42 , the other is non - linear and quadratic in the fluctuations of the optical mode . allowing @xmath43 , the non - linear interaction has a negligible contribution and one obtains linearized equations of motion : @xmath44          \\delta\\dot{\\hat{a } } = ( -\\kappa+i\\delta)\\delta\\hat{a}+ig_0\\alpha_\\textrm{s}\\delta\\hat{x}+\\sqrt{2\\kappa}\\delta\\hat{a}_\\mathrm{in } ,      \\end{cases } \\label{eqn : linearized equations of motion}\\ ] ] where we introduced the effective detuning @xmath45 . to solve the linear system of differential equations we move to the fourier domain with the transform @xmath46 ( the tilded superscript will be dropped for simplicity of notation ) .",

    "the quantum fluctuation operators of the output field @xmath41 and @xmath56 are correlated with each other .",
    "this arises from the fact that the original input shot noise acts on the mirror which then transduces the fluctuations back to the optical field .",
    "entering from two channels , the noise can destructively interfere and the optical modes can undergo a reduction in quantum fluctuations , or squeezing . it should be noted that a similar response is obtained by dissipative optomechanics  @xcite , however the typical coupling strengths of this scheme are generally too weak to apply a significant contribution and will not be considered for the following analysis . from eq .",
    "[ eqn : output field solution ] one can recognize that the effective mechanical susceptivity @xmath57 plays a role analogous to that of the optomechanical coupling strength @xmath24 in the cross - coupling .",
    "this factor , opportunely modulated by the airy functions @xmath58 , contributes to the frequency dependence of the correlations terms at the origin of optomechanical squeezing .",
    "it is also a consequence of @xmath57 that the coupled dynamics vanish at high frequencies .",

    "when phase squeezing ( @xmath136 ) is injected , the photon - counting noise is effectively reduced , improving sensitivity at higher frequencies .",
    "however , the motion of the test masses becomes subject to higher fluctuations induced by anti - squeezing on the amplitude quadrature , and the sensitivity at lower frequencies is compromised .",
    "the impact of phase squeezing is equivalent to having higher power available in the arms of the interferometer , without the complications arising from increased thermal noise on the test masses and their suspension .",
    "squeezing of the amplitude quadrature ( @xmath137 ) prompts the opposite effect , and sensitivity is enhanced in the lower - frequency band while noise increases at the other side of the spectrum .",
    "hybrid squeezing ( @xmath138 ) , can beat the sql close to the frequency of optimal sensitivity for gravitational waves at @xmath1 , but the increased noise due to traces of anti - squeezing in both phase and amplitude degrade the quality of the measurement outside of this bandwidth .",
    "this kind of measurement could be useful for detection enhancement of signals from known gravitational wave sources , like pulsars .",
    "as we have shown , squeezing obtained via an optomechanical system has an inherent frequency dependence that could compensate for the effects of @xmath139 over a wider section of the measurement band compared to squeezing at a fixed quadrature .",
    "however , in the optomechanical system it is not just the squeezed angle that is frequency dependent : the squeezing factor , as inferred from fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum]b - d , also varies across the spectrum .",
    "this seemingly undesirable property could prove advantageous if we consider that the frequency dependence of the squeezed quadrature might not accomplish the full rotation desired .",
    "when the squeezed quadrature deviates significantly from @xmath139 , the measurement would mostly be obstructed by anti - squeezing and it would be preferable to renounce all cross - correlations between the quadratures .",
    "this is also common to fixed - quadrature squeezing , where the sensitivity is degraded by anti - squeezing in half of the total spectrum .",
    "thus , even if broadband enhancement is not achieved , the absence of interaction away from the dispersive centre could be used to one s advantage if the system is prepared to provide high squeezing in a region with reduced quadrature rotation ( for example , from @xmath140 to @xmath141 ) and no change from a conventional interferometer elsewhere .    the performance of gravitational - wave interferometers in different set - ups is shown in fig .  [ fig : sensitivity ] , which compares the sensitivity of a traditional interferometer with no squeezing injection ( black ) to that obtained by injecting frequency - independent squeezing from a traditional source ( blue ) and frequency - dependent squeezing obtained via optomechanics ( orange ) .",

    "[ eqn : standard quantum limit ] calculated at @xmath142 and additionally rescaled in terms of frequency by @xmath143 .",
    "the squeezing at a fixed quadrature is taken with a uniform squeeze factor of @xmath144 , comparable to the finest optomechanical squeezing achievable with the chosen parameters .",
    "realistic interferometers are subject to propagating losses that may reduce the operative squeezing from @xmath144 to @xmath145  @xcite , but as this would apply equally regardless of the source we consider the former for a clearer comparison . at no detuning ( @xmath118 ,",
    "[ fig : sensitivity]a ) , optomechanical squeezing can perform generally better than fixed hybrid squeezing at all frequencies ; the advantage is particularly noticeable at frequencies higher than @xmath1 , where most of the rotation takes place and the difference between the two traces gets as high as @xmath146 before the interaction becomes too weak and the trace converges to that of a conventional interferometer .",
    "the situation is similar with a negative detuning ( @xmath124 , fig .",
    "[ fig : sensitivity]b ) : compared with pure amplitude squeezing , optomechanical squeezing avoids the additional noise introduced by anti - squeezing at high frequencies while still achieving noise cancellation in the lower end of the spectrum , although of slightly lower calibre . a positive detuning ( @xmath124 , fig .",
    "[ fig : sensitivity]c ) can result in a broad sensitivity enhancement in the region between @xmath1 and @xmath147 without the need to sacrifice too much sensitivity at lower frequencies , as opposed to the frequency - independent squeezing that can not neutralize anti - squeezing in the wrong quadrature",
    ". one should remember that there is a singularity at the effective mechanical frequency @xmath114 , and deviation from the optimal quadrature close to this frequency might introduce undesired noise into the system .",
    "considering imperfections in the precision of the lock systems , we can see the effects of deviations by up to @xmath148 of a radian on the sensitivity in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : sensitivity]a .",
    "quadratures different from @xmath149 induce a small region of better sensitivity before a spike of overwhelming noise takes over around the resonance . as the angle gets closer to the optimal one",
    ", this effect spans a narrower region until it gets completely cancelled for @xmath150 , for which the spectrum is identical to the original shot noise .",
    "the reason why better sensitivity is still possible for quadratures that differ from @xmath149 lies in the fact that the rotation achieved by the optomechanical system is not the ideal one required by the gravitational wave detector , and a slight deviation may actually bring it closer .",
    "we characterized the frequency - dependent properties of optomechanical squeezing and found that the quadrature rotation observed could have interesting applications in gravitational - wave detectors . compared to squeezing from a traditional opo source , injection of optomechanically - generated squeezing",
    "can be both beneficial and detrimental for the sensitivity of the interferometric signal .",
    "the inherent quadrature rotation extracted from the coupled dynamics of the light and the resonator is an attractive option to counteract the combined action of radiation pressure and shot noise , and could provide an elegant alternative to rotation obtained through a filter cavity .",
    "we project a sensitivity enhancement of up to @xmath146 in the measurement band above @xmath1 when the two methods are compared at a cap of maximum squeezing of @xmath144 . additionally , the response of the optomechanical cavity to different detunings offers extended flexibility and a broader choice on the type of enhancement accessible .",
    "the extensive efforts placed by the gravitational - wave community in the suppression of mechanical noise , particularly in the bandwidth of interest , should pose a strong foundation for the experimental implementation of an optomechanical system with specifications similar to the ones suggested .",
    "unfortunately there could be several obstacles to be overcome before the realization of a full implementation : for example the thermal requirements might prove hard to meet , or locking might not be good enough and oppressive noise due to anti - squeezing of nearby quadratures could compromise the measurement . on the other hand ,",
    "the technical feasibility of cavity - induced rotation at @xmath151 has yet to be demonstrated . a cavity approaching that required exists  @xcite , but the losses are still unfavourable .",
