    "the multi - tev energies available at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) have opened up the possibility to measure , for the first time in heavy - ion collisions , various large - mass elementary particles .",
    "after the first observations of the @xmath12  @xcite and @xmath13  @xcite bosons , as well as bottom - quark ( @xmath14-jets )  @xcite , there remains only three standard model ( sm ) elementary particles to be directly measured in nucleus - nucleus collisions : the @xmath15 lepton , the higgs boson , and the top quark . whereas the @xmath15 measurement should be straightforward , that of the higgs boson is beyond the lhc reach as it requires much larger cross sections and/or luminosities  @xcite , such as those reachable at the proposed future circular collider ( fcc )  @xcite with about seven times larger center - of - mass energies than at the lhc .",
    "the study presented here shows , for the first time , that the top - quark the heaviest elementary particle known will be produced ( singly or in pairs ) in sufficiently large numbers to be observed in lead - lead ( pb - pb ) and proton - lead ( p - pb ) collisions at the lhc and fcc .",
    "since the width of the top - quark ( @xmath16  2  gev ) is much larger than the parton - to - hadron transition scale given by @xmath17  0.2  gev , the top - quark is the only coloured particle that decays before its hadronization .",
    "its short lifetime , @xmath18  0.1  fm / c , implies that the top decays into a @xmath19 final - state with a nearly 100% branching ratio  @xcite mostly , and the lorentz - boost factor is @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the @xmath22-quark rapidity . at the lhc ( @xmath23 ) the lorentz - dilated mean decay time is @xmath24 , and at the fcc ( @xmath25 ) , @xmath26 ; to be compared with the typical qgp formation time of @xmath27  fm / c , and lifetime of @xmath28  fm / c . ] within the strongly - interacting medium , such as the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , formed in nuclear collisions . the large top - quark mass ( @xmath29  173  gev ) provides a hard scale for high - accuracy perturbative calculations of its quantum - chromodynamics ( qcd ) and electroweak production cross sections ( next - to - next - to - leading - order , or nnlo , is the current theoretical state - of - the - art  @xcite ) .",
    "at hadron colliders , top quarks are produced either in pairs , dominantly through the strong interaction , or singly through the weak interaction . at the energies considered here , the dominant production channels , as obtained at nlo accuracy with the mcfm  code  @xcite ,",
    "are : ( i ) gluon - gluon fusion , @xmath30 , contributing by 8095% to the total pair production ( the remaining 520% issuing from quark - antiquark annihilation ) , ( ii ) @xmath22-channel single - top electroweak production @xmath31 ( the @xmath32-channel process , decreasing with energy , amounts to 51.5% of the total single-@xmath22 cross section ) , and ( iii ) associated top plus @xmath12-boson , @xmath33 , production ( increasing with energy , it amounts to 2550% of the @xmath22-channel process ) .",
    "the theoretical motivations for a dedicated experimental measurement of the top - quark in heavy - ion collisions are varied and include , at least , the following studies :    \\(i ) constraints on nuclear parton distribution functions ( npdfs ) .",
    "the @xmath6 cross sections in proton - proton ( p - p ) collisions can be used to constrain the proton pdfs  @xcite . in the heavy - ion case ,",
    "top - pair production probes the nuclear gluon density in an unexplored kinematic regime around bjorken-@xmath34 values , @xmath35  5@xmath3610@xmath370.05 , and virtualities @xmath38  gev@xmath10 , a region characterized by net positive , albeit small , anti - shadowing corrections .",
    "in addition , at the fcc , the @xmath14-quark npdf ( in single - top production ) , and even the top - quark npdf itself , are generated dynamically by the constituent gluons and become necessary ingredients of the theoretical cross section calculations .",
    "\\(ii ) heavy - quark energy loss dynamics .",
    "the top quark can radiate gluons before its @xmath39 decay which , given its very - short lifetime , occurs mostly inside the qgp .",
    "medium - induced gluon radiation off light - quarks and gluons , leading to `` jet quenching ''  @xcite , results in a factor of two reduction of jet yields in pb - pb  compared to p - p  collisions at @xmath2  =  2.76  tev  @xcite .",
    "although solid theoretical expectations for heavy - quark radiation predict a reduced amount of gluonstrahlung at small angles due to the `` dead cone '' effect  @xcite , the experimental data somehow unexpectedly shows the same amount of suppression for jets from light - flavours and @xmath14-quarks  @xcite .",
    "the relative role of elastic and radiative scatterings on the energy loss of heavy - quarks is an open issue in the field  @xcite .",
    "the detailed study of top - quark production in heavy - ion collisions would therefore provide novel interesting insights on the mechanisms of parton energy loss .",
    "in addition , the study of boosted top - pairs ( with transverse momenta above @xmath40  1  tev ) traversing the qgp as a colour - singlet object for a fraction of their time , will allow one to probe the medium opacity at different space - time scales .",
    "\\(iii ) colour reconnection in the qgp .",
    "the top mass , featuring the strongest coupling to the higgs field , is a fundamental sm parameter with far - reaching implications including the stability of the electroweak vacuum  @xcite .",
    "currently , the dominant @xmath41 systematic uncertainty is of theoretical nature and connected to the modeling of the colour connection and qcd interferences between the @xmath6 production and decay stages , and among the hadronic decay products .",
    "indeed , the colour - flow ( through gluon exchanges and/or non - perturbative string overlaps ) between the @xmath22 and @xmath42 quarks , their decayed @xmath14-quarks , and the underlying event from multi - parton interactions and beam - remnants surrounding the initial hard scattering  @xcite , results in uncertainties on the reconstructed @xmath41 of a few hundred mev .",
    "the amount of top quark interactions with the colour fields stretched among many partons involved in nuclear collisions will be obviously enhanced compared to more elementary systems .",
    "thus , the reconstruction of the top - quark mass in the qgp ( assuming its feasibility is not jeopardized by the large @xmath14-quark energy loss already observed in the data ) , or in proton - nucleus interactions , would provide interesting insights in non - perturbative qcd effects on a crucial sm parameter .    in this paper",
    "we mostly focus on npdf constraints through top - pair production in p - pb  and pb - pb  collisions .",
    "we also provide the expected @xmath43 reach of top quark spectra at various energies to indicate where boosted final - states can be measured for energy loss studies .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec:2 ] the theoretical setup used",
    "is outlined , which is then used to compute the nlo cross sections at the lhc and fcc , and associated yields expected after typical acceptance and efficiency cuts , for top - pair and single - top production , presented in section  [ sec:3 ] .",
    "section  [ sec:4 ] quantifies the impact on the nuclear pdfs provided by the measurement of the rapidity distributions of the decay leptons from top - quark pairs produced at the lhc and fcc , using a hessian pdf reweighting technique  @xcite .",
    "the main conclusions of the work are summarized in section  [ sec:5 ] .",
    "the top - pair and single - top cross sections are computed at nlo accuracy with the mcfmcode  @xcite ( version 6.7 ) using the nlo ct10 proton pdfs ( including its 52 eigenvector sets )  @xcite corrected for nuclear effects ( shadowing , antishadowing and emc )  @xcite through the eps09 npdfs ( including its 30 error sets ) for the pb ion  @xcite .",
    "as our main purpose is to provide estimates for the feasibility of different top - quark measurements in nuclear collisions , we do not discuss here the ( subleading ) sensitivity of the cross sections to different sets of proton pdfs ( nor associated variations of the strong coupling @xmath44 ) .",
    "also , while there are other nuclear pdf sets available  @xcite , we only employ eps09 here as it is the only npdf set that is consistent with the dijet measurements in p - pb  collisions at the lhc  @xcite ( the data would probably agree also with the latest npdfs by ncteq  @xcite , but these sets are not available at the time of writing this article ) .",
    "we run the following mcfm  processes : @xmath45 for @xmath6 production , @xmath46 for single-(anti)top in the @xmath22-channel , @xmath47 in the s - channel , and @xmath48 for associated @xmath49 production .",
    "we note that , at nlo , the theoretical processes defining @xmath49 production partially overlap with those contributing to top - quark pair production  @xcite .",
    "this is accounted for in our mcfm@xmath49 cross sections calculations by vetoing the additional emission of a @xmath14-jet .",
    "the code also properly accounts for the different isospin ( @xmath51- and @xmath52-quark ) content of the pb nucleus , which has a small impact on the electroweak single - top processes .",
    "all numerical results have been obtained using the latest sm parameters for particle masses , widths and couplings  @xcite , and fixing the default renormalization and factorization scales at @xmath53  =  @xmath41 for @xmath6 and @xmath22-,@xmath32-channel single - top , and at @xmath54  =  @xmath55  gev for the @xmath49 processes .",
    "the nlo calculations used here reproduce well the cross sections experimentally measured at the lhc in p - p  collisions at @xmath56  =  7 ,  8  tev for @xmath6  @xcite , @xmath22-channel single - top  @xcite , and associated @xmath49  @xcite production .",
    "incorporation of next - to - nlo corrections  @xcite would increase the theoretical cross sections , by about 10% , i.e. the so - called @xmath57-factor amounts to @xmath58  1.10 , and further improve the data - theory agreement .",
    "the computed nucleon - nucleon cross sections are scaled by the pb mass number ( @xmath59  =  208 ) to obtain the p - pbcross sections , and by @xmath60  =  43264 in the pb - pb  case , as expected for hard scattering processes in nuclear collisions .",
    "the uncertainties of the theoretical cross sections are obtained from the values computed using the eigenvector sets of , first , the ct10 and , then , eps09 pdfs and adding them in quadrature , as well as by independently varying the renormalization and factorization @xmath61 and @xmath62 scales within a factor of two ( for the central ct10 and eps09 set ) . the pdf and scale uncertainties amount each to 310% for @xmath6 and 36% for single top .",
    "the scale uncertainties have no impact on the npdf constraints derived below given that the scale dependence of the nuclear modifications in pdfs around @xmath63 is very mild ( see e.g. fig .  1 in ref",
    ".  @xcite ) and that differences between proton and nuclear pdfs are obtained via ratios of ( p - pb , pb - pb)/(p - p ) cross sections at the same colliding energy , where those mostly cancel out .",
    "table  [ tab:1 ] collects the total cross sections , and associated scale and pdf uncertainties , for top - pair and single - top production in p - pb  and pb - pb  collisions at lhc and fcc energies , obtained as described in the previous section . in the case of @xmath6 and @xmath49 production , a net eps09 gluon antishadowing in collisions with pb ions results in an increase of the total production cross sections by about 28% compared to those ( @xmath59-scaled ) obtained for p - p  collisions using the proton ct10 pdf . for @xmath22- and @xmath32-channel single - top cross sections ,",
    "the overall nuclear modifications are quite insignificant , @xmath642% depending on the energy .",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ] shows the total top - pair and single - top cross sections as a function of collision energy for p - p , p - pb  and pb - pb  collisions in the range of c.m .",

    "the single - top curves are obtained adding the @xmath22-,@xmath32-channel and @xmath49 cross sections listed in table  [ tab:1 ] . in general ,",
    "top - quark pair production is a factor of two ( four ) larger than the sum of single top processes at the lhc ( fcc ) .",
    "the nominal lhc and fcc energies for p - pb  and pb - pb  collisions are indicated by dashed boxes in the plot .",
    "going from lhc to fcc , the total cross sections increase by significant factors , @xmath66(5590 ) for @xmath6 and @xmath66(3040 ) for single - top .",

    "the first uncertainty is due to theoretical scale variations , and the second one to the ct10 and eps09 pdf errors added in quadrature . [ tab:1 ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in order to provide an idea of the top - quark @xmath43 reach accessible in the different measurements listed in table  [ tab : yields ] , we have also computed the expected @xmath67 transverse - momentum distributions in pb - pb  and p - pb  collisions , after all acceptance and efficiency criteria applied ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ptreach ] ) .",
    "the maximum top - quark @xmath43 experimentally measurable per lhc ( fcc ) year will be around @xmath68  300 ( 1500 )  gev for pb - pb , and @xmath68  500 ( 1800 )  gev for p - pb . given the limited lhc top - quark statistics , the study of boosted - tops will be thus only accessible at the future circular collider .",
    "as aforementioned , 8095% of the total pair production at lhc  fcc comes from gluon - gluon fusion processes and , thus , @xmath6 cross sections can be used to constrain the relatively badly - known gluon densities in the pb nucleus . in this section",
    "we quantify the impact that top - quark measurements at the lhc and fcc would have on better constraining the nuclear pdfs through the so - called hessian pdf reweighting technique  @xcite .",
    "such pdf reweighting procedure is based on the fact the error sets @xmath70 defined in hessian pdf - fits correspond to a certain increment @xmath71 ( @xmath72 for eps09 ) of the global `` goodness - of - fit '' @xmath73 function whose minimum @xmath74 is achieved with the central set @xmath75 .",
    "the error sets thereby constitute a parametrization of the original @xmath73 function which can be taken advantage of in order to determine the associated pdf uncertainty after adding new experimental datasets .",
    "more precisely , the hessian method @xcite for determining the pdf errors writes the response of the original @xmath73 function to fit - parameter variations @xmath76 as @xmath77 where the hessian matrix @xmath78 is diagonalized in the last step .",

    "the corresponding theoretical values are denoted by @xmath84 and they depend on the pdfs .",
    "to first approximation , the @xmath85 dependence of each @xmath84 is given by @xmath86 where @xmath87 , @xmath88 is the theory value computed with the central set @xmath75 , and @xmath89 is the theory value evaluated with the error set @xmath70 . inserting eq .",

    "as noted earlier , the _ total _ @xmath69 production cross section is expected to undergo only a mild increase due to nuclear effects in the npdfs , and it may be challenging to resolve such an effect from overall normalization uncertainties .",

    "the pair - production cross sections are @xmath0  =  3.4  @xmath1b for pb - pb  at @xmath2  =  5.5 , and @xmath0  =  50  nb for p - pb  at @xmath2  =  8.8  tev . at the fcc energies of @xmath2  =  39,63  tev , the same cross sections are factors of 90 and 55 times larger respectively .",
    "the total @xmath6 cross sections are enhanced by 38% in nuclear compared to p - p  collisions at the same c.m .",
    "energies , due to an overall net gluon antishadowing , although different regions of the top - quark differential distributions are depleted due to shadowing and emc - effect corrections .",
    "the total cross sections for single - top , including the sum of @xmath22- and @xmath32-channels plus associated @xmath49 processes , are a factor of two ( four ) smaller than that for top - pair production at the lhc ( fcc ) and feature minimal nuclear modifications ( @xmath642% depending on the energy ) .    after applying typical acceptance and efficiency cuts in the leptonic final - state , @xmath146",
    ", one expects about 100 and 300 ( anti)top - quarks per lhc - year and 5@xmath147 and 10@xmath148 per fcc - year at the nominal luminosities in pb - pb  and p - pbcollisions respectively . at the end of the lhc heavy - ion programme , with @xmath149  10  nb@xmath150,1  pb@xmath150",
    "integrated pb - pb  and p - pb  luminosities , about 2.5 thousand ( fully - leptonic ) @xmath67-quarks should have been measured individually by the cms and atlas experiments .",
    "the number of visible single - top quarks produced in association with a w boson , in the similar @xmath151 final state , is lower by a factor of about 30 compared to @xmath6 production , due to the combination of lower cross sections , smaller reconstruction efficiencies , and only one top - quark per event .",
    "the proposed top - quark measurements at the lhc and fcc would not only constitute the first observation in nuclear collisions of the heaviest - known elementary particle , but would open up interesting novel physics opportunities such as constraints of nuclear parton densities in an unexplored kinematic range , studies of the dynamics of heavy - quark energy loss in the qgp , and colour - reconnection effects on the top - quark mass .",
    "we have , in particular , quantified the impact on the nuclear pdfs of the rapidity - differential distributions of the decay leptons from top - quark pairs , through the hessian reweighting technique , finding that the data can be used to reduce the uncertainty on the pb gluon density at high virtualities by up to 30% using the full lhc heavy - ion programme , and by about 70% with just one fcc - year .",
