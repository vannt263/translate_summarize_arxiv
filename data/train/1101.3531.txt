    "the broad - band infrared ( ir ) observations are well suited for the study of the evolution of snrs . besides the general advantage of suffering less extinction effects , there are diverse important phenomena related to supernova remnants ( snrs ) which are bright in the ir wavebands . in the near- and mid - ir regimes , for example , one can study the distributions of dense ejecta from core - collapse supernova explosions ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , circumstellar material produced by mass loss of the progenitors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , shock interactions between snrs and nearby molecular clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and hot dust synthesized in ejecta ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , along with the emission from the central compact objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the far - ir observations of snrs , on the other hand , are relatively rare but very efficient to investigate cold dust which often contributes to a significant portion of the total mass of the dust in snrs .",
    "first , it is studied that the swept - up dust in snrs is responsible for the most of cooling of snrs and plays a critical role in the evolutions of snrs in dense medium @xcite .",
    "secondly , the far - ir observations of snrs appear to provide better means of studying the dust formed during the process of supernova explosion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "finally , if an snr is interacting with a nearby molecular cloud , its far - ir emission is expected to be significantly enhanced by the swept - up , inter - clump medium in the cloud or by the evaporation of dense clumps ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although the reality of these processes is yet to be confirmed observationally .",
    "kes 17 , known as g304.6@xmath80.1 , is such an object in which broad - band ir observations can play an important role in our understanding of snrs . until recently this snr has only been studied in radio continuum and oh line observations @xcite , revealing broken radio shell structures in the west and south .",
    "the recent @xmath2 observations , however , detected very bright ir emission in the 38  @xmath0 m range @xcite , which makes it in fact one of the brightest snrs in the wavelength range .",
    "the follow - up spectroscopic observations in the 530  @xmath0 m range also detected many strong  emission lines @xcite .",
    "very recently , the xmm - newton x - ray observations detected centrally filled thermal x - ray emission inside the non - thermal radio shell , listing it as a member of the class of mixed - morphology snrs @xcite .",
    "all these indicate that kes  17 is interacting with nearby molecular gas and that more ir observations are needed to better understand its nature . in this paper , we present extensive broad - band ir observations of kes  17 using the @xmath1 satellite , together with new analyses of archival @xmath2 and radio continuum data .",
    "for the distance to kes  17 , only a lower limit of 8  kpc , corrected for the distance between the sun and the galactic center of 8.5 kpc , is known from the observations of  line @xcite .",

    "the @xmath1 imaging observations of kes  17 were carried out covering the mid - ir ( 1327 @xmath0 m ) and far - ir ( 50180 @xmath0 m ) bands on 2007 february 5 and 6 , respectively .",

    "the most conspicuous feature in the ir images is the bright emission of @xmath3 5 in the western shell apparent in all of the ir bands .",
    "the emission appears to be clumpy and filamentary in the near- and mid - ir bands up to 24 @xmath0 m , whereas it becomes unresolved in the longer ( 65160 @xmath0 m ) wavelength images due to increasingly large beam sizes .",
    "this ir emission in the western shell partly overlaps that of the radio continuum emission .",
    "in addition to the bright western shell , there is relatively weak mid - ir ( 15 and 24 @xmath0 m ) emission in the southern shell overlapping the radio continuum emission in this region .",
    "there exists noticeable background emission in the direction of kes  17 in all the images longer than 4.5 @xmath0 m ( figure  [ fig_ir ] ) , especially in the northeast . in order to identify the southern shell emission in the 15 and 24 @xmath0 m images more clearly",
    ", we subtract the background emission from both the images as follows : first , given that both the 4.5 and 8 @xmath0 m emission of kes  17 is due to the same origin ( i.e. , emission from shocked ; see   4 for the details ) in the western shell , we obtain a linear correlation with a correlation coefficient @xmath15 @xmath11 0.86 between the 4.5 and 8 @xmath0 m emission of the shell . based on the correlation , we scale the 4.5 @xmath0 m emission to 8 @xmath0 m and subtract the scaled emission from the observed 8 @xmath0 m emission to create a background image at 8 @xmath0 m .",
    "next , we obtain a linear correlation of @xmath15 @xmath11 0.89 between the background 8 @xmath0 m emission and the 24 @xmath0 m emission outside the boundaries of kes  17 , and then scale the 8 @xmath0 m emission to 24 @xmath0 m using the correlation .",
    "we subtract the scaled emission from the observed emission at 24 @xmath0 m , which finally gives the background - removed 24 @xmath0 m image of kes  17 ( figure  [ fig_mid ] ) .",
    "the peak surface brightnesses of the western shell after the background subtraction are 6.1  @xmath16  1.5 and 6.4  @xmath16  1.5 mjy sr@xmath10 for 15 and 24 @xmath0 m bands , respectively .",
    "we apply the same method to obtain the background - removed @xmath1 15 and 24 @xmath0 m images . in all these processes , we convolved the images of different beam sizes with that of the 24 @xmath0 m images . in figure  [ fig_mid ]",
    "we can now easily identify the existence of the southern shell at 15 and 24 @xmath0 m which overlaps that of the radio continuum .",
    "for far - ir images of 65 , 90 , 140 , and 160 @xmath0 m , we estimate the background emission by taking the median value in the region between 4@xmath17 and 6@xmath17 radius from the center of kes 17 .",
    "after background subtraction , the peak surface brightnesses of the western shell are 108  @xmath16  24 , 135  @xmath16  45 , 173  @xmath16  84 , and 117  @xmath16  55 mjy sr@xmath10 for 65 , 90 , 140 and 160 @xmath0 m bands , respectively .",

    "the errors in the flux measurements are mainly caused by the uncertainties in the background measurements and also by those associated with the calibrations of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 observations .",
    "we estimate the line contributions to the observed fluxes of the 15 and 24 @xmath0 m bands using the @xmath2 irs 838 @xmath0 m spectra .",
    "we construct the irs spectra by subtracting the background obtained outside the shell structure and integrate them over the bandpass .",
    "the estimated line contributions are 75  @xmath16  21 ( 15 @xmath0 m ) and 38  @xmath16  10 % ( 24 @xmath0 m for both @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) , respectively .",
    "the line emission in these bands is dominated by  and ionic lines .",

    "the line contributions in these bands are mostly due to [ ] at 63 @xmath0 m . for the 140 and 160 @xmath0 m bands , we expect the line contributions to be less than 5  % by scaling the flux of the [ ] 63 @xmath0 m line that we obtain above to those of [ ] 145 @xmath0 m and [ ] 153 @xmath0 m lines in a shocked region @xcite . figure  [ fig_sed ] shows the flux distribution of the western shell excluding the line contributions .",
    "the ir synchrotron flux expected from an extrapolation of the radio fluxes applying synchrotron power - law index of @xmath140.54 @xcite is less than a few percents of the measured ir values , supporting that the observed continuum is dominated by dust emission . in order to calculate temperatures of the dusts responsible for the mid- and far - ir emission of kes  17",

    "the mass of the hot ( 79  k ) dust is @xmath19  @xmath20  @xmath7 and that of the cold ( 27  k ) dust is 6.7  @xmath16  4.0  @xmath20  @xmath7 .",
    "the luminosities of the dust emission are ( 9.5  @xmath16  6.1 )  @xmath5  10@xmath21  @xmath20 @xmath22 and ( 8.1  @xmath16  5.0 )  @xmath5  10@xmath23  @xmath20 @xmath22 for the hot and cold components , respectively .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that the hot dust temperature could have been overestimated if there is any contribution from stochastically heated small grains to the 15 and 24 @xmath0 m continuum fluxes @xcite .",

    "( see table  4 for their coordinates . )",

    "the linear correlation between the upper energy level and the upper column density represented by a straight line in figure  [ fig_lpop ] indicates the level population of the local thermodynamic equilibrium at the excitation temperature of 2200  @xmath16  400  k. the spectra of other positions , which have smaller number of detected lines , show similar excitation temperatures to that of b2 .",
    "the ir emission of kes  17 shows the existence of both the western and southern shell structures .",
    "the former is visible in all the ir bands , while the latter is visible only in the mid - ir bands of 15 and 24 @xmath0 m .",
    "the near - ir emission of the western shell is dominated by  line emission ( figure  [ fig_spec ] ) , which suggests that kes  17 is interacting with molecular gas in this region , consistent with the results of previous observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the distribution of the mid - ir emission overlaps that of the radio continuum emission in the western and southern shells ( figure  [ fig_mid ] ) , supporting the interpretation that it represents swept - up dust at the boundary of the snr . on the other hand ,",
    "the far - ir emission is similar to the near - ir emission with only the western shell being readily identifiable .",
    "the coexistence of the far - ir emission from the cold dust and the near - ir line emission form shocked molecular gas in the western shell suggests that the bright far - ir emission of kes  17 in this region is also related to the interaction of the source with a nearby molecular cloud .",
    "the far - ir luminosity of kes  17 ( @xmath3  8100  @xmath20  @xmath22 ;   3 ) makes it one of the most luminous snrs in the far - ir wavebands and the second ( after cassiopeia a ) galactic snr detected up to 160 @xmath0 m in the ir wavebands @xcite . for comparison ,",
    "only eight snrs were detected by iras at 100 @xmath0 m with far - ir luminosity larger than kes  17 @xcite , five of them interacting with molecular clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our observations also strongly suggest that the far - ir emission of kes  17 is originated from the dust in a molecular cloud interacting with the snr .",
    "however , molecular shocks producing strong  lines in a dense molecular cloud can not directly generate bright far - ir dust continuum emission .",
    "this is because , in the non - dissociative molecular shock with shock speeds of @xmath18 50 km s@xmath10 , the gas temperature does not rise above a few thousand degrees @xcite .",
    "this is inadequate to heat the dust grains sufficiently high enough to emit bright far - ir continuum emission . instead ,",
    "if a molecular cloud is clumpy , composed of clumps and inter - clump medium , then the far - ir emission may be produced by faster shocks propagating in the inter - clump medium of lower densities .",
    "even though the density of inter - clump medium is lower than that of the h@xmath24 emitting clumps , it can still be high enough to contain large amount of dusts and reduce shock speeds significantly . in the",
    "following we consider these possibilities .",
    "when snr shocks propagate into a clumpy molecular cloud , hot gas in swept - up inter - clump medium behind shock front collisionally heats dusts to produce the ir emission .",
    "the estimated dust mass of the western shell of kes  17 is @xmath27  m@xmath28 .",
    "if the cloud initially occupies the entire western region with normal dust - to - gas ratio of 1  % , the pre - shock inter - clump density is @xmath29 @xmath30 . assuming that kes  17 is in a sedov phase with radius of @xmath3  7  @xmath9  pc , the shock velocity in the inter - clump medium is @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the sn explosion energy in the unit of 10@xmath33 erg and @xmath34 is the density of the inter - clump medium . in this swept - up inter - clump gas ,",
    "the ir surface brightness of the dust by strong shocks is @xcite @xmath35 around 90 @xmath0 m , which , for the obtained inter - clump density and velocity of @xmath3 40 @xmath30 and @xmath3 200 km s@xmath10 , gives comparable surface brightness to the observed value .",
    "note that the calculation by @xcite expects the peak of dust emission power ( @xmath36 ) at the mid - ir wavelength ( @xmath37 m ) , while our observations indicate a somewhat flat @xmath36 peak around the 6590  @xmath0 m bands .",
    "this is suggestive that there may be a significantly increased amount of large dusts contributing effectively in the far - ir regime if the shocked inter - clump medium is responsible for the observed emission of kes  17 .",
    "alternatively , the bright far - ir emission of kes  17 may be the emission of dusts injected from an evaporating cloud @xcite .",
    "if so , the expected ir luminosity of an evaporating cloud in the hot gas of an snr is @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the radius of the cloud and @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the density and temperature of the hot gas , respectively .",
    "the x - ray emitting gas was recently detected inside the radio shell of kes  17 @xcite , suggesting that the evaporation should occur at the surface of an ir emitting cloud where it is in contact with the hot interior gas .",
    "the temperature and density of the hot x - ray gas are @xmath42  k and @xmath43  @xmath30 , respectively @xcite .",
    "we expect the ir luminosity of an evaporating cloud to be @xmath3 2,000  @xmath44 @xmath22 using the cloud radius of 3  @xmath9  pc ( @xmath45 ) at 90 @xmath0 m ( figure  [ fig_ir ] ) .",
    "this is somewhat smaller than the observed far - ir luminosity ( @xmath3 8000 @xmath22 , ",
    "3 ) of kes  17 , indicating that the dust emission from an evaporating cloud may contribute only a small amount of the far - ir emission of kes  17 , although we can not rule out the possibility completely given the various uncertainties involved in the measurements .",
    "another explanation of the bright far - ir emission of kes  17 may be that the dusts in a pre - shock molecular cloud heated by strong radiation of the snr shocks in a radiative phase emit the observed emission .",
    "the shocks propagating into a molecular cloud at the western shell of kes  17 can easily become radiative for the pre - shock density of @xmath46 100  @xmath30 if gas cooling is efficient . taking a power - law temperature dependence of the cooling efficiencies ( @xmath47 ;",
    "* ) , @xcite calculated a radiative shell forming at the radius @xmath48 with a shell velocity @xmath49 for a pre - shock density @xmath50 and a radiative shell forming time @xmath51 = 10,000 yrs .",
    "this indicates that kes  17 likely has a radiative shell , if the pre - shock density is @xmath52 20 @xmath30 . using the shell forming values and a cloud radius of @xmath39 = 3  @xmath9  pc ,",
    "the luminosity of a radiative shock at the western shell of kes  17 is expected to be @xcite @xmath53 which appears to be adequate to explain the observed luminosity of the western shell (   3 ) . in this case",
    ", we expect the peak of the dust emission power to be at the far - ir ( @xmath54 60 @xmath0 m ) region for the dusts of mixture of carbonaceous and silicate grains @xcite , consistent with the results of this study .",
    "this can also explain the absence of the x - ray emission in the western shell of kes  17 as the lack of x - ray emitting high temperature gas in the radiative phase @xcite .",
    "our near - ir ( 2.55.0 @xmath0 m ) spectra of the western shell of kes  17 indicate the excitation temperature of 2200  @xmath16  400  k for  gas in this region ( figure  [ fig_spec ] ) .",
    "this is different from the previous results based on the @xmath2 observations where a mixture of two components of  gas of @xmath3 300  k and @xmath3 1200  k was proposed to explain the observed intensity distribution of  lines of the western shell in the 528 @xmath0 m range @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy in the excitation temperature suggests that the  gas in the western shell is in a thermal admixture as found in other  gas interacting with snrs @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig_lcal ] shows the excitation diagram of  lines detected in both the @xmath2 and @xmath1 observations , covering the upper energy level of 100017,000  k. ( note that while the @xmath2 results represent the levels of @xmath46 7,000  k , the @xmath1 results do the levels of higher temperatures . )",
    "we fit the observed excitation diagram with a thermal admixture model where the column density of  gas is related to a power of its temperature of 1004,000  k : @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "the ortho - to - para ratio is fixed to be 3 in the fit .",
    "the best fit gives 3.0  @xmath16  0.1 , ( @xmath56  @xmath26 , and ( @xmath57  @xmath30 for the power index , column density , and number density , respectively . the solid curve in figure  [ fig_lcal ] represents the best - fit model to the observed data , where we can identify that the model prediction matches the observed values well .",
    "this column density is twice that of the two temperature model of the @xmath2 observations , while the number density is between those obtained for the warm and hot components of the @xmath2 results @xcite .",
    "the obtained power index of 3.0  @xmath16  0.1 is comparable to what obtained from other sources @xcite , and is not far from 3.8 obtained for bow shocks @xcite .",
    "if kes  17 is indeed interacting with clumpy molecular gas ( see   5.1 ) , it can be easy to develop a group of shocks around dense clumps with various shock velocities , which in turn naturally leads to an admixture of  gas of different temperatures .",
    "we show in this paper that kes  17 is one of the most luminous snrs in the ir wavebands , reaching the far - ir luminosity of @xmath3 8100 @xmath22 .",
    "its ir emission is concentrated on the western and southern shell structures .",
    "the western shell is bright in the mid- and far - ir continuum and the near - ir  line emission , whereas the southern shell is visible only in the mid - ir continuum emission .",
    "the far - ir continuum and near - ir  line emission of the western shell is related to its interaction with nearby molecular gas .",
    "it is apparent that there exists dense shocked molecular gas , excited to @xmath3 2,000  k , in this region that produces the observed  line emission .",
    "if the molecular gas is clumpy , the observed far - ir emission can be produced by the dust associated with inter - clump molecular gas of lower densities .",
    "the far - ir emission may originate from the dust emission of the swept - up inter - clump molecular gas , the dust emission from an evaporating cloud , or the dust emission exposed to strong radiative shocks .",
    "the mid - ir emission of kes  17 is bright in both the western and southern shells and overlaps radio continuum emission which forms a partly - broken circular shell structure .",
    "this suggests that the mid - ir and radio continuum emission delineates the boundary of kes  17 made by the swept - up material .",
    "the sed distribution of the ir emission of kes  17 indicates the existence of two dust components : hot ( 79  @xmath16  6  k ) component of @xmath19  @xmath20  @xmath7 and cold ( 27  @xmath16  3  k ) component of 6.7  @xmath16  4.0  @xmath20  @xmath7 .",
    "the former is responsible for most of the mid - ir continuum emission , while the latter is for the far - ir emission .",
    "the observed flux distribution of the  lines , on the other hand , can be explained with a thermal admixture of the shocked molecular gas of different temperatures in the 1004,000  k range .",
    "this thermal admixture of the shocked molecular gas may be a natural consequence of the interactions between kes  17 and clumpy molecular gas in which various shock velocities can easily produce thermal admixture of the molecular gas .",
    "overall , it appears that combined far - ir continuum and near - ir spectroscopic observations are very useful to studying snrs interacting with molecular gas , as was the case for kes  17 in this paper , providing information for both the gas and dust components associated with the shock interactions .",

    "<S> we present the results of infrared ( ir ; 2.5160 @xmath0 m ) observations of the supernova remnant ( snr ) kes  17 based on the data obtained with the @xmath1 and @xmath2 satellites . </S>",
    "<S> we first detect bright continuum emission of its western shell in the mid- and far - ir wavebands together with its near - ir molecular line emission . we also detect hidden mid - ir emission of its southern shell after subtraction of the background emission in this region . </S>",
    "<S> the far - ir luminosity of the western shell is @xmath3 8100 @xmath4 , which makes kes  17 one of the few snrs of significant far - ir emission . </S>",
    "<S> the fittings of the spectral energy distribution indicate the existence of two dust components : @xmath3 79  k ( hot ) and @xmath3 27  k ( cold ) corresponding to the dust mass of @xmath3 6.2  @xmath5  10@xmath6 @xmath7 and @xmath3 6.7 @xmath7 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the hot component represents the dust emission of the material swept up by the snr to its western and southern boundaries , compatible with the distribution of radio continuum emission overlapping the mid - ir emission in the western and southern shells . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of hot ( @xmath3 2,000  k ) , shocked dense molecular gas revealed by the near - ir molecular line emission in the western shell , on the other hand , suggests that the cold dust component represents the dust emission related to the interaction between the snr and nearby molecular gas . </S>",
    "<S> the excitation conditions of the molecular gas appear to be consistent with those from shocked , clumpy admixture gas of different temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss three possibilities for the origin of the bright far - ir emission of the cold dust in the western shell : the emission of dust in the inter - clump medium of shocked molecular clouds , the emission of dust in evaporating flows of molecular clouds engulfed by hot gas , and the emission of dust of nearby molecular clouds illuminated by radiative shocks . </S>"
