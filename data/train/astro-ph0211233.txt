    "relativistic jets originating in the close environment of a rotating black hole are observationally indicated for two categories of sources concerning mass and energy output . in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , the jets are launched in the magnetized environment around a rotating , super massive black hole ( blandford & payne  1982 , sanders et al .  1989 ) .",
    "the discovery of galactic microquasars has proven superluminal motion on a much smaller energy scale ( mirabel & rodriguez 1994 ) , the central engine , however , is believed to work similarly to the agn .    from the observations we know that astrophysical jets are collimated to almost cylindrical shape .",
    "relativistic jets are generally detected in non - thermal radio emission , clearly indicating the magnetic character of jet formation  magnetic acceleration and collimation .",
    "there is clear evidence that jet formation is always connected to the existence of an accretion disk . as the central object in agn and microquasars is a black hole ,",
    "the surrounding accretion disk is the only possible location for a magnetic field field generation . considering the before mentioned observational constraints",
    ", it is clear that a theoretical , quantitative analysis of the jet structure in these sources must take into account both magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) effects and ( general ) relativity .",
    "relativistic mhd implies that electric fields , which are unimportant in newtonian mhd , can not be neglected .    due to the complexity of the mhd equations , all stationary , relativistic models of magnetic jets",
    "so far , rely on simplifying assumptions such as self - similarity ( contopoulos 1994 ) , some other prescription of the field structure ( li 1993 , beskin 1997 ) or the restriction to asymptotic regimes ( e.g. appl & camenzind 1993 ; nitta 1997 ; beskin & malyshkin 2000 ) . as",
    "relativistic jets must be highly magnetized , the force - free limit of mhd may be applied .",
    "this allows for a truly _ two - dimensional _ ( 2d ) calculation of the field structure ( camenzind 1987 ; fendt et al .",
    "1995 ; fendt 1997 ; fendt & memola 2001 ) , in contrast to the self - similar treatment .",
    "the stationarity assumption itself is essential in order to obtain a _",
    "global _ solution of the equations . yet , time - dependent mhd simulations of relativistic jet formation are limited in spatial scale and to a short time evolution ( koide et al .",
    "2000 ) . on the other hand",
    ", we do not really know whether a stationary mhd solution obtained is actually stable .",
    "the axisymmetric , stationary electromagnetic equations in the context of kerr metric were first derived by znajek ( 1977 ) .",
    "the more comprehensible formalism of a `` 3 + 1 split '' has been introduced by thorne et al .",
    "( see thorne et al .",
    "camenzind ( 1986 , 1987 ) formulated a fully relativistic stationary description of axisymmetric mhd flows presenting solutions of the grad - shafranov and the wind equation . an essential step to obtain the _ global _ magnetic field structure is to take into account properly the regularity condition along the light surface .",
    "this matching problem of relativistic magnetospheres has been solved by fendt et al .",
    "( 1995 ) . the general relativistic version of the grad - shafranov equation including inertial terms and entropy has been presented by beskin & pariev ( 1993 ) .",
    "solutions of the wind equation in kerr geometry considering the stationary plasma motion along the magnetic field were obtained by takahashi et al .",

    "@xmath11 @xmath9 denotes a global time in which the system is stationary , @xmath12 is the angle around the symmetry axis , and @xmath13 are similar to the flat space spherical coordinates .",
    "the electromagnetic field @xmath14 , the current density @xmath15 , and the electric charge density @xmath16 are measured by the zamo according to the locally flat minkowski space .",
    "these local experiments are put together by a global observer at a certain global time using the lapse and shift function to transform from local to global frames . in spite of this transformation , maxwell s equations in the 3 + 1 split",
    "look similar to those in minkowski space .",
    "the axisymmetric field structure follows from the force - balance across magnetic flux surfaces .",
    "the magnetic flux function @xmath17 measures the magnetic flux through a loop of the killing vector @xmath18 .",
    "similarly , the total poloidal current is defined by integrating the poloidal current density over the same loop @xmath19 the indices p and t denote the poloidal and toroidal components of a vector . in the force - free limit , @xmath20 we have @xmath21 and , thus , @xmath22 . for a degenerated magnetosphere , @xmath23 another conserved quantity",

    "the derivative of the time component of the vector potential defines the iso - rotation parameter @xmath24 which is sometimes interpreted as angular velocity of the magnetic field lines .",

    "for a polytropic gas law ( @xmath45 ) , the wind equation can be converted into a polynomial equation ( camenzind 1986 ) , where the coefficients @xmath46 depend on the radius along @xmath34 , the field strength and the parameters @xmath47 .",
    "the magnetization @xmath48 measures the poynting flux in terms of mass flux .",
    "we now discuss the gse solution for a force - free , collimating jet in the general relativistic context ( see fendt 1997 ) , assuming @xmath49const . as asymptotic boundary condition",
    "we apply the analytical , special relativistic 1d gse solution of appl & camenzind ( 1993 ) .",
    "since @xmath50 , this asymptotic solution provides the gse source term also for the collimation region .",
    "the disk magnetic field distribution is parameterized as @xmath51 , here , the magnetic flux anchored in the black hole is @xmath52 with @xmath53 and a core radius @xmath54 .",
    "the asymptotic jet radius can be parameterized in terms of the light cylinder radius @xmath55 or the gravitational radius @xmath1 . for @xmath56 , @xmath57 ,",
    "the jet radius is @xmath58 corresponding to @xmath59 .",
    "the main features of the calculated jet magnetosphere are the following ( fig.1 , _ left _ ) .",
    "the field lines originate near the inner light surface close to the rotating black hole and collimate to an asymptotic jet of finite radius of several ( asymptotic ) light cylinder radii .",
    "the solution is defined on a global scale , satisfying the regularity condition along the light surfaces .",
    "we find a rapid field collimation within @xmath60 distance from the source .",
    "the near - disk solution has three different regimes . here ,",
    "the magnetic flux is either outgoing towards the asymptotic jet or in - going towards the black hole .",
    "but there exist also flux surfaces near the axis which not connected to the disk . thus ,",
    "if we imagine a mass flow associated with the field lines , we expect three different flow regimes  accretion , outflow , and a region empty of a plasma flow .    extending our work on relativistic magnetospheres , we have investigated jets with non - constant @xmath61 ( see fendt & memola 2001 ) . here , _",
    "relativity is not taken into account .",
    "since astrophysical jets seem to be always connected to an accretion disk , differential rotation of the field lines should be a natural ingredient for any jet model .",
    "however , as a difficulty , then the position and shape of the light surface singularity is not known a priori , but have to be calculated iteratively with the field distribution .",
    "similar to @xmath62 , also the rotation law @xmath61 can be taken from the asymptotic gse solution .",
    "the calculated magnetic field structure is shown in fig.1 ( _ right _ ) .",
    "the differentially rotating magnetosphere is collimated into a narrower jet .",
    "this , however , can be balanced by an increase of electric current .",
    "comparison to high - resolution radio observations of the m87 jet ( junor et al .",
    "1999 ) shows good agreement in the collimation distance . for m87",
    "we derive a light cylinder ( jet ) radius of 50 ( 120 ) schwarzschild radii .",
    "the field structure is governed by @xmath62 and @xmath61 . in combination with the disk magnetic flux distribution this allows to determine the magnetic angular momentum loss from the disk in the jet and the toroidal magnetic field along the disk .",
    "the angular momentum flux per unit time per unit radius is @xmath63 along the disk . in our solutions ,",
    "most of the magnetic angular momentum is lost in the outer part of the disk ( fendt & memola 2001 ) .      here , we discuss solutions of the stationary , general relativistic , mhd wind equation ( 3 ) along collimating magnetic flux surfaces .",
    "the solutions are calculated on a global scale up to several 1000 gravitational radii .",
    "different magnetic field geometries were investigated , parameterized by the shape of the magnetic flux surface and the flux distribution ( fendt & greiner 2001 , fg01 ) .",
    "applying microquasar parameters , we obtain the following results ( fig.2 ) .",
    "the solution passes all three critical points ( slow , alfvn and fast magnetosonic point ) .",
    "substantial acceleration is achieved also beyond the alfvn point due to the magnetic nozzle effect ( camenzind 1986 , li 1993 ) .",
    "the temperature in the inner jet is up to @xmath64k .",
    "the jet injection radius is at @xmath65 .",
    "comparison to solutions with smaller injection radius ( @xmath66 ) allows to clarify the role of general relativity for the jet acceleration . in this case , the asymptotic velocity is much higher due to the faster rotation @xmath67 at smaller radii . with @xmath68 the asymptotic velocity increases to @xmath69 ( fg01 ) .    in the limit of minkowski",
    "metric the jet magnetization can be low , although the asymptotic speed is the same as for schwarzschild metric ( fg01 ) .",
    "the jet flow is not affected by gravity and , thus , needs less magnetic energy to gain the same asymptotic speed by magnetic acceleration .",
    "solutions for different kerr parameter @xmath70 show that the jet is faster for smaller @xmath70 ( see fg01 ) .",
    "the reason for this seems to be the fact that the effective potential of a black hole weakens for increasing values of @xmath70 .",
    "these results might not be surprising as just demonstrating the fact of a _ magnetically driven _ jet .",
    "mhd theory tells us that magnetic acceleration takes place mainly around the alfvn point .",
    "if that is far out , the influence of general relativity must be marginal .",
    "the mhd wind solutions discussed above provide the flow dynamics along a prescribed poloidal magnetic field line with maximum temperatures up to @xmath64k in the innermost part of the jet . here",
    ", we calculate the thermal optically thin x - ray spectrum of such a jet . prescribing the jet mass flow rate @xmath71 together with the shape of the field line ,",
    "the wind solution gives a unique set of parameters of the flow .",
    "for each volume element of the expanding jet flow with decreasing temperature and density and increasing velocity we compute the continuum spectrum and the emission lines of an optically thin plasma ( see memola et al .",
    "the spectra of the single volumes are then put together to an overall spectrum taking into account the doppler factor @xmath72 for shifting ( @xmath73 ) and boosting ( @xmath74 ) the emitted energy @xmath75 and luminosity @xmath76 .",
    "these factors vary due to the different velocity @xmath77 of the matter in these volumes and the different inclination @xmath78 of the velocity vectors to the line of sight .",
    "figure 3 shows the spectra of two example volume elements of different temperature ( and velocity ) for different jet inclinations .",
    "the combined total spectrum of all volume elements within the collimating jet cone is shown in fig.3 ( _ right _ ) .",
    "we find a x - ray luminosity @xmath79 ( @xmath80 for a microquasar .",
    "the 6.6 and 6.9kev emission lines can be identified as @xmath81 iron lines , while the one at 8.2kev could be the @xmath82 .",
    "we emphasize that our approach is not a _ fit _ to certain observed spectra . in contrary , for the first time , for a jet flow with characteristics defined by the solution of the mhd wind equation , we derive its x - ray spectrum .",
