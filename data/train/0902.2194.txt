    "the possibility of producing mini black holes in high energy collisions is one of the exciting prospects of research at the lhc .",
    "it appears as one of the major implications of brane - world models , where the presence of extra dimensions opens up the possibility for a lowered planck scale @xmath0 @xcite , so that gravity is much stronger in the spacetime which includes the extra dimensions and black holes can then be produced in high energy collisions @xcite .",
    "two key signatures of such black holes would be the observation of hawking radiation and the measurement of quasi - normal mode frequencies @xcite .",
    "although at the horizon of a black hole the emitted hawking radiation is a perfect black - body radiation , for an observer at infinity the radiation appears modified .",
    "this is because in escaping from the black hole the radiation needs to cross the non - trivial potential around the black hole which implies that part of the radiation will backscatter , resulting in a frequency - dependent factor that modifies the otherwise ideal black body radiation .",
    "this is known as a grey - body radiation and has a spectrum described by a modified black - body emission rate , which in @xmath1 dimensions is of the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 stands for the angular momentum quantum number , and @xmath4 for any other quantum numbers of the emitted particles .",
    "@xmath5 is the grey - body factor modifying the black - body radiation at the horizon to the spectrum observed at asymptotic infinity away from the black hole .",
    "the hawking temperature @xmath6 for a schwarzschild black - hole is given in terms of the horizon radius @xmath7 and the number of extra dimensions @xmath8 @xcite , @xmath9 for such a black hole , @xmath7 is enhanced and given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the mass of the black - hole .    clearly , an experimental observation of hawking radiation from such black holes is a very exciting prospect as it constitutes direct observational evidence of black - holes .",
    "it should provide a rich source of information about the dimensionality and structure of spacetime as well as constitute a first step toward establishing quantum gravity as a discipline accessible to experimental investigation .",
    "one way of exploring experimental implications of such theories that can be observed at accelerators has been through event generators .",
    "many such programs have appeared over the years @xcite , the most recent and comprehensive of which is perhaps blackmax @xcite .",
    "based on phenomenologically realistic models free of serious problems that plague low - scale gravity , it incorporates all grey - body factors known to date along with several effects that make predictions which are as realistic as possible .    in brane - world models ,",
    "we need to localize standard model ( sm ) particles on a 3-brane yet allow gravity full access to the bulk .",
    "such a localization is often done via a projection from higher dimensional spacetime onto a four - dimensional hypersurface identified as a 3-brane representing our world .",
    "while this method succeeds in describing the geometry , it fails to capture the defining feature of the brane , which is its tension .",
    "the latter is often neglected owing to the difficulties in obtaining exact solutions of einstein s equations in higher dimensions in the presence of a brane of finite tension .",
    "recently , a solution that incorporates a 3-brane of finite tension in six - dimensional spacetime was constructed by kaloper and kiley for static black holes @xcite .",
    "it was subsequently extended to include rotating black holes @xcite . in this model , at the position of the brane a conical singularity forms that acts to off - load tension thereby keeping both bulk and brane locally flat .",
    "some work @xcite has already been done to study the implications of including tension in this way , resulting in qualitative as well as quantitative modifications which may affect the interpretation of experimental results .",
    "the present work aims at continuing in that line by studying analytically the effects of including tension on grey - body factors . in detail , section [ sec2 ] is a quick review of the main effects of including tension in the schwarzschild case and the attendant modifications of the parameters of the black - hole . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we obtain analytical expressions for low - frequency grey - body factors for bulk as well as brane - localized emissions , and and then compare with exact numerical results . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we calculate analytically grey - body factors in the case of large imaginary frequencies , again for emissions both in the bulk and on the brane . in the tensionless limit ,",
    "our expressions are valid for arbitrary number of extra dimensions .",
    "finally , section [ sec5 ] contains our conclusions .",
    "black - holes formed through high energy collisions are expected to evaporate through several phases ( e.g. @xcite ) . after the initial `` balding '' phase where the gauge hair and other asymmetries are lost , a spin - down phase ensues , with a small portion of mass being lost by radiating away the angular momentum .",
    "however , it is expected that the black - hole will spend most of its life in the schwarzschild phase emitting spherically symmetric hawking radiation . in what follows",
    "we will concentrate only on this phase .    in brane - world scenarios , a small black hole with radius @xmath7 which is much smaller than the size of the extra dimensions @xmath12 is in fact completely immersed in the full @xmath13 dimensional spacetime . in",
    "asymptotically flat space , the metric that describes a non - rotating black - hole in higher dimensions is a generalization of the 4-dimensional schwarzschild metric @xcite , @xmath14 where the element @xmath15 defines a @xmath16-sphere . to geometrically localize fields on the brane ,",
    "what has often been done is to project onto the brane by setting all angular coordinates @xmath17 to @xmath18 , except for the usual 4-dimensional angles @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting 4d metric then reads @xmath21 as mentioned earlier , such treatments neglecting the tension @xmath22 of the brane are mainly due to the the difficulty of obtaining higher - dimensional solutions of einstein s equations in the presence of a brane of finite tension .",
    "they can be justified on the grounds that in order for a black hole to be treated semi - classically , its mass must be much bigger than the planck scale , so that the tension of the brane does not appreciably alter the black hole background and at a scale @xmath23 the solution is flat .",
    "while this is in principle true , it turns out that for a black hole to be clear of the quantum regime in this context , given a gravity scale of the order of @xmath24 , the mass of the black hole needs to be on the order of just a few tev @xcite .",
    "however , because brane tension will be generated from contributions to vacuum fluctuations due to brane - localized fields , one expects the tension to be of the same order as the fundamental scale of the theory .",
    "therefore , in order to be realistic , the brane tension ought to be taken into account .    by introducing tension using the kaloper - kiley codimension-2 setup @xcite , the tension of the brane does not curve either the brane or the bulk , but forms a conical singularity instead , creating a deficit angle @xmath25 . by adapting to brane tension",
    ", @xmath25 provides a self - tuning mechanism which leaves both bulk and brane locally flat .",
    "it is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 .",
    "the resulting geometry is the same as that of schwarzschild , except that a wedge defining the deficit angle is now cut out with its edges identified , or equivalently , the coordinate @xmath28 gets rescaled .",
    "the resulting metric reads @xmath29 with @xmath30\\ ] ] one significant implication that can be readily shown is that the radius of the horizon gets enhanced , @xmath31 hence also the geometrical cross - section and production rate , which is important from an experimental point of view .",
    "semi - classically , we can study the propagation of particles of spin @xmath32 in the vicinity of a black hole by writing the corresponding field equation in the background of the metric of the black hole .",
    "the resulting equation can then be separated into a radial equation and a set of angular equations .",
    "the radial equation is most conveniently dealt with by casting it into a schrdinger - like form , @xmath33\\right)\\psi \\left(r_*\\right)=0\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the `` tortoise coordinate '' defined by @xmath35 and @xmath36 is an effective potential which depends on the type of particle considered .",
    "the potential also depends on the eigenvalues of the angular equations , so that in order to find the observationally significant eigenvalue @xmath37 of the radial equation , we need to first solve the angular eigenvalue problems .",
    "an exact solution for the angular eigenvalues for integer spin was first obtained in @xcite .",
    "it was subsequently derived using jacobi polynomials for dirac fermions in @xcite .",
    "we can sum up the effects of including tension in the codimension-2 model for emissions in the bulk by the following replacement rules @xmath38{b}},\\quad \\ell _",
    "i\\to \\lambda _ i=\\ell _",
    "i+\\left(\\frac{1}{b}-1\\right)m,\\quad \\psi \\to b \\psi\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the orbital quantum number for the @xmath40th angular equation , and @xmath41 is the magnetic quantum number . for brane - localized emissions",
    "the same rules apply except that the orbital quantum number does not get modified . in subsequent sections",
    "these rules will be the main ingredient in obtaining explicit analytical expressions for grey - body factors including brane tension .",
    "calculations of grey - body in the case of low - frequency have been performed both for bulk @xcite and brane - localized emissions @xcite . in this section",
    "we shall extend these results to include brane tension .    in general",
    ", one tries to find an approximate solution of the radial equation which is valid at infinity and another one valid near the horizon .",
    "then by matching the two solutions in the common domain of validity one can extract the coefficients of reflection and transmission and hence deduce the absorption coefficient ( grey - body factor ) as a function of frequency .    for bulk emissions of integer spin",

    "the solution can be written in terms of bessel functions , @xmath67 in the low frequency regime , @xmath68 the asymptotic solution ( [ eq23 ] ) may be approximated near the horizon by @xmath69 matching the two asymptotic solutions in the intermediate region ( ( [ eq25 ] ) and ( [ eq26 ] ) , respectively ) , we obtain @xmath70 where we used @xmath71 ( eq .",

    "let us first look at some graphical representations of this result .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] depicts the absorption probability as a function of @xmath76 with @xmath77 fixed .",
    "as can be seen , all types of perturbation exhibit the same qualitative behavior with the probability vanishing as @xmath78 and increasing monotonically as @xmath75 .",
    "this behavior persists qualitatively at high frequency as demonstrated in figure [ fig2 ] which was obtained from points generated by exactly solving for absorption probability numerically .",
    "a further demonstration of how tension suppresses the absorption probability is provided in figure [ fig3 ] , where probability _ vs _ frequency in the case of a scalar perturbation is plotted for various values of @xmath76 in the small frequency regime .",
    "the graph also has points representing exact numerical calculations .",
    "as expected , the predictions of the analytical formula diverge from the exact values with increasing frequency .",
    "finally , figure [ fig4 ] shows the effect of the magnetic quantum number @xmath41 in the case of scalar emission .",
    "the qualitative behavior of all curves is the same , however the absorption probability varies over many orders of magnitude depending on @xmath41 . in figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] , the type of perturbation chosen has a negligible effect on the outcome .    moving on to the case of brane localized modes ( the photon , massless fermion and scalar )",
    ", we note that because we are projecting onto the brane , angles @xmath79 and @xmath28 will be fixed , so that the dependence of the metric on @xmath76 will only be through @xmath7 inside the metric function @xmath80 . aside from that , the results pertaining to the grey - body factors will be identical to those in the tensionless case . to find these grey - body factors we follow the same procedure as above , but instead using an equation analogous to the teukolsky equation on the brane . for a static background ,",
    "the radial wave equation is ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath81 + \\left\\ { { \\frac{{\\omega ^2 r^2 } } { f } + 2is\\omega r - \\frac{{is\\omega r } } { f}(n + 1)(1 - f ) } \\right .",

    "the corresponding angular equation reads @xmath83 where @xmath84 are known as the spin - weighted spherical harmonics . for @xmath85 ,",

    "one can see from the expressions above that only the first few values of @xmath89 contribute to the emission spectrum making the emission rate for scalars higher than for gauge vectors in this frequency range .",
    "this can be seen numerically in the absence of tension in the results of @xcite . at higher frequencies",
    "the situation reverses , and the rate for scalars becomes smaller .",
    "graphs analogous to those for bulk emissions are shown in figures [ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] for scalars . for low frequencies , the behavior with varying tension is now reversed and emission is enhanced with increased tension . for higher frequencies the trend is not as conclusive .",
    "the difference between the two cases can be understood in terms of two competing effects : _ ( a ) _ the enhancement of the geometrical cross - section with tension implies an increased rate of emission for both bulk and brane - localized modes , and _",
    "( b ) _ the fact that the angular eigenvalues increase with tension and appear only in the bulk potential ( causing the potential barrier to increase ) results in suppression of only bulk emissions .    from an experimental point of view , it is of great interest to know the relative emissivities between brane and bulk modes .",
    "the above discussion seems to hint that the inclusion of tension favors the ehm conjecture @xcite , namely , that black holes emit mainly on the brane . to verify this in our case ,",
    "let us consider the emission spectrum as defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) for scalars . for that",
    ", we need to write the grey - body factor @xmath92 in terms of the absorption probability @xmath93 and scalar multiplicities @xmath94 . for either bulk or brane - localized emissions",
    "it is of the form @xmath95 in the bulk , the scalar multiplicities are @xcite @xmath96 whereas on the brane they they are equal to the standard value @xmath97 . starting with the bulk , we numerically solve eq .",
    "( [ eq16 ] ) for the absorption probability with @xmath98 , and using eq .",
    "( [ eq83 ] ) , we end up with the spectrum shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] . a similar calculation for brane - localized scalars",
    "is done by projecting the bulk equation on the brane , and the result is shown in fig .",
    "notice that in both figures , the emission rates are enhanced with tension .",
    "the reason for this comes primarily not from the grey - body factor , but rather from the denominator in the black - body distribution which depends on the hawking temperature that is common to both types of emission .",
    "we can discount this effect by looking at the relative emissivity , in which we take the ratio of the emission rate in the bulk to that on the brane . figure [ fig10 ] shows this for scalars .",
    "similar plots are obtained for gauge vectors . on the brane",
    ", we again have the multiplicities @xmath97 , but in the bulk we have @xmath99 in the bulk , we solve eq .",
    "( [ eq16 ] ) with @xmath100 , and on the brane eq .",
    "( [ eq36 ] ) is solved with @xmath87 .",
    "the results of doing this are shown in figures [ fig11 ] through [ fig13 ] . in this case",
    "the emissivity is only partial , since the scalar degree of freedom is not included .",
    "we can see that in both cases , in the range shown , the emission rate is greater on the brane than in the bulk , in support of the ehm claim . it should be pointed out , however , that even though mini black - holes at the lhc will spend most of their life in the schwarzschild phase , they first form with non - zero angular momentum .",
    "this has been shown to modify the hawking radiation due to super - radiance in such a way that emission in the bulk at the initial phase dominates over emission on the brane @xcite .",
    "next we turn our attention to grey - body factors at large imaginary frequencies .",
    "we shall discuss different values of spin and take into account the extra dimensions as well as the brane tension in the codimension-2 model @xcite .",
    "the calculation will follow the method of andersson and howls @xcite which was then used by cho @xcite .",
    "it is a combination of the monodromy argument of motl and neitzke @xcite and the standard complex - coordinate wkb method .",
    "the first step is to rewrite the master equation ( [ eq11 ] ) in a form suitable for the application of the wkb method . to this end",
    ", we introduce the redefinition of the wavefunction , @xmath101 which reduces ( [ eq11 ] ) to @xmath102 the resulting wkb solution is @xmath103\\ ] ] with @xmath104 being a reference point , and @xmath105\\ ] ] integer spin particle are described by the potential ( [ eq9 ] ) .",
    "following motl and neitzke @xcite , we go around a contour in the complex @xmath106-plane and impose preservation of monodromy . because of the exponential nature of the wkb solutions , dominance will be exchanged between the two exponentials as we move around the complex plane .",
    "this implies that some terms that are exponentially small and can be overlooked in one region of the complex plane can grow exponentially in a different region . to take this into account",
    ", one needs to resort to the stokes phenomenon which keeps track of these changes .",
    "in such an analysis , we need to pay attention to the zeroes and poles of @xmath107 .",
    "in particular , it can be shown that from each simple zero of @xmath108 there emanate 3 stokes lines along which @xmath109 is imaginary .",
    "this means that one of the two solutions @xmath110 will grow exponentially whereas the other one will decay as we move away from the reference point @xmath104 . on the other hand , we can also define anti - stokes lines emanating from each zero of @xmath108 along which @xmath111 is real and @xmath110 are oscillatory functions . by crossing anti - stokes lines , the exponential behaviors of the two solutions",
    "are switched , while extending the solution across a stokes line , the linear combination defining the solution is changed in a well - defined way : the coefficient of the dominant term stays the same , but that of the sub - dominant term picks up a contribution proportional to the coefficient of the dominant term .",
    "thus we see that the appropriate contour that can be used will trace anti - stokes lines and cross stokes lines .",
    "figure [ fig7 ] shows such a contour for schwarzschild geometry assuming ( large ) purely imaginary frequency .",
    "one can see from the potential ( [ eq9 ] ) that for @xmath112 , all zeroes of @xmath108 approach the origin and the potential may be approximated by its expansion around @xmath113 . in this case , the @xmath46-dependent terms are negligible .",
    "they enter in subleading contributions @xcite .",
    "near @xmath113 , keeping only the most singular term , the potential in ( [ eq9 ] ) , which describes integer - spin perturbations , becomes : @xmath114 and the resulting wkb equation is : @xmath115 where @xmath116\\ ] ] however , one can show @xcite that the solutions @xmath117 so obtained by identifying @xmath118 with @xmath119 , do not have the right behavior near the origin when compared with the exact solution near there .",
    "this can be rectified by using a slightly different @xmath120 , which is permissible .",

    "a master equation potential based on a higher - dimensional dirac equation potential was derived in @xcite , @xmath134 + f\\left ( { \\frac{{\\ell   + \\frac{{d - 2 } } { 2 } } } { r } } \\right)^2\\ ] ] by expanding near @xmath113 , we find this potential to be proportional to @xmath135 , which , for the present purpose , can be treated as zero when compared to the other bulk perturbation given by ( [ eq72 ] ) . at this approximation , therefore , we may use @xmath136 for a bulk dirac fermion .    turning our attention to the actual calculation of grey - body factors ,",
    "we see that since @xmath77 in the present case is not real , the conservation of flux will take on the following generalized form : @xmath137 and therefore , we consider two separate solutions representing the boundary condition at physical infinity ; one with frequency @xmath138 and the other with @xmath139 . in the first case ,",

    "the special case of two extra dimensions with tension was seen to follow from a simple modification of the hawking temperature .",
    "we compared our analytic expressions in the two asymptotic regimes of low and high frequencies , respectively , with exact numerical solutions and discussed the range of intermediate frequencies where our analytic expressions are not accurate .",
