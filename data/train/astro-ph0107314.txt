    "the eastern clump is comparatively diffuse , whereas the western clump is smaller and denser .",
    "to get an indication of temperature variations in the cluster , we created a map of the hardness ratio .",

    "we also discarded pixels with less than twice the background to reduce inaccuracies near the edge of the cluster where we have low counts .",

    "this hardness ratio map is shown in figure 8 .",
    "lighter colors correspond to a higher hardness ratio and may indicate higher temperatures .",

    "the eastern clump does appear to have a higher hardness ratio and , therefore , a higher temperature than the western clump .",
    "there does not appear to be a shock between the two clumps .",
    "indeed , the interclump region is cooler than the cluster as a whole .",

    "( na00 , d98 ) .",
    "na00 also find two components and identify the eastern clump as the main cluster component .",
    "indeed our position of the eastern clump is quite close to the central cd galaxy which has r.a.(2000 ) = 10@xmath2156@xmath2259@xmath23.9 and decl.(2000 ) = @xmath003@xmath2437@xmath2537@xmath26.3 ( d98 ) .",
    "the western clump could either be a subgroup falling into the cluster or a foreground group of galaxies .",
    "since we detect an iron line , we fit for the redshift of the western clump in xspec and get a value of z = @xmath44 , which agrees well with the redshift of the cluster .",
    "substructure can also be seen in the weak lensing analysis of the optical data . in their weak lensing study ,",
    "hoekstra et al .",
    "( 2000 ) find three clumps in the mass distribution that all appear to have similar masses .",
    "an approximate overlay of the chandra x - ray contours on their weak lensing mass reconstruction is shown in figure 9 .",
    "their central and western clumps seem to correspond to our eastern and western clumps .",
    "however , we do not detect the north - eastern weak lensing clump .",
    "this result was noted by clowe et al .",
    "( 2000 ) when they overlaid the _ rosat / hri _ contours on the keck weak lensing data .",
    "it is possible that this third peak is not as fully collapsed as the other two and , therefore , is not yet visible in x - rays .",
    "alternatively , reanalysis of the weak lensing data shows that the details of the substructure are not well constrained by the data ( marshall 2001 ) .",
    "we used the galaxy redshifts published in tran et al .",
    "( 1999 ) to estimate the mean velocity of each of the three weak lensing clumps . for the north - eastern , central , and western clumps the mean velocities and one sigma errors are @xmath45 km s@xmath14 , @xmath46 km s@xmath14 , and @xmath47 km s@xmath14 respectively .",
    "the difference in the velocities of the unseen north - eastern peak and central peak is @xmath48 km s@xmath14 , indicating that a significant relative velocity is possible but not required by the limited data ( 6 - 7 galaxies per clump ) .    in the hst image ,",
    "ms  1054 has a filamentary appearance .",
    "it is possible that this cluster is in reality a series of clumps along a filament that are in the process of merging .",
    "the clear separation of the two x - ray peaks indicate that the cluster is most likely in a pre - merger state .",
    "when considering the overlay of the x - ray contours on both the hubble mosaic and the weak lensing mass map it appears that both the cluster galaxies and mass associated with the western subclump lie below the x - ray peak .",
    "this leads to the interesting possibility that the gas in the subclump is being stripped off as it falls into the cluster .    in light of this cluster s complicated structure using a spherical , hydrostatic",
    ", isothermal model may lead to errors in estimating the mass . to get an indication of these errors",
    ", we turn to cluster simulations .",
    "simulations show that mergers can introduce large errors in mass estimates using x - ray properties , but generally produce underestimates ( mathiesen & evrard 2001 ; evrard , metzler , & navarro 1996 ; roettiger , burns , & loken 1996 ; schindler 1996 ) . in section 4",
    "we estimate the virial mass of the cluster using a scaling relation between the mass and x - ray temperature .",
    "scaling relations between cluster virial mass and temperature are normalized through cluster simulations and use either a mass weighted or emission weighted temperature .",
    "these temperatures are not necessarily the same as the spectral temperature obtained from observations .",
    "recently , mathiesen & evrard ( 2001 ) have used simulations to investigate the relationship between these three temperatures . as they note , one might expect that a subclump containing cooler gas would cause an underestimation of the cluster temperature and mass , whereas a shock containing hotter gas would cause an overestimate of these properties",
    ". however , the larger effect will be due to the subclump which is more massive and luminous than the gas in the shock , and mergers will lead to an underestimate of the mass .",
    "indeed , they find that the spectrally determined temperatures are nearly always lower than both the emission and mass - weighted temperatures with typical errors of 10 - 20% . in the case of the mass - weighted temperature",
    "they show that all large underestimates of the temperature occur close to a merger .",
    "we conclude that if ms  1054 is not in hydrostatic equilibrium , then we should underestimate its mass .",
    "this only strengthens our conclusions about @xmath5 .",
    "we resolve nine point sources within a 3@xmath25 radius of the cluster center . from a nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) search ,",
    "one of these corresponds to lcrs  b105416.2@xmath0032123 , which is an agn detected at radio frequencies with a redshift of 0.2 .",

    "although this object was not found in the ned database , there is a small object in the hst image that may correspond to it .",
    "using the x - ray temperature for the full cluster , @xmath1 kev , we can estimate both the velocity dispersion and mass of ms  1054 and compare to optical results . from the _ chandra _ temperature the implied velocity dispersion is @xmath55@xmath49@xmath56 km s@xmath14 .",
    "this agrees well with the observed velocity dispersion of @xmath57 km s@xmath14 ( tran et al .",
    "1999 ) and the velocity dispersion derived from weak lensing of @xmath58 km s@xmath14 ( hoekstra , et al .",
    "2000 ) .    the virial mass of the cluster can be estimated for @xmath5 = 1 by assuming that the mean density in the virialized region is @xmath59200 times the critical density at the cluster s redshift and that the cluster is isothermal ( evrard et al .",
    "1996 , hjorth , oukbir , & van kampen 1998 , d98 ) . from the simulations of evrard",
    "et al . ( 1996 ) , the mass - temperature relation for the mass within a region whose density is 200 times the critical density is @xmath60 ( arnaud & evrard 1999 ) .",
    "this scaling law method of estimating the mass of clusters is more accurate than estimates derived from a @xmath12-model fit to the surface brightness because the scaling law has a smaller variance and is less sensitive to the cluster s dynamical state .",
    "however , the scaling law method depends on the normalization of the m - t relation which is derived from cluster simulations ( evrard et al .",
    "bryan & norman ( 1998 ) compare the normalizations from several cluster simulation studies and find that the scatter in normalizations is small , similar to the scatter of clusters around the m - t relation .",
    "we use the relation given by evrard et al .",
    "( 1996 ) because it gives the smallest mass . as we noted before",
    ", we expect to underestimate the mass due to the presence of substructure and this can only strengthen our conclusions in the following section .    from the _ chandra _ temperature",
    ", the virial mass is approximately @xmath61 within @xmath62 mpc .",
    "the errors here represent the errors in the temperature .",
    "this mass is somewhat lower than those derived from weak lensing , @xmath63 , and the observed velocity dispersion , @xmath64 ( hoekstra , franx , & kuijken 2000 ; tran et al .",
    "assuming @xmath65 in order to compare with our mass , these masses are approximately @xmath66 and @xmath67 respectively .",
    "another method of estimating the mass comes from fitting a beta - model to the observed surface brightness .",
    "the radial surface brightness profile is modelled as @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the core radius .",
    "the background subtracted radial surface brightness profile is shown in figure 11 .",
    "attempts to fit to a @xmath12-model failed because the best fit was obtained for unreasonably large values of @xmath12 and the core radius .",
    "this behavior was also noted in na00 for the _ rosat / hri _ data .",
    "na00 found that if they removed the western substructure they could get a good fit to a @xmath12-model ; however , we were not able to get a reasonable fit even with the western clump removed",
    ". in their simulated clusters , bartelmann & stienmetz ( 1996 ) find that they get more accurate masses by constraining @xmath12 to be one and fitting for the core radius , though their masses are still biased low by about 10% .",
    "following this method , we get a best - fit core radius of 1.1@xmath25 ( 270 kpc ) .",
    "this core radius is rather large , on the order of the size of the cluster .",
    "however , using eq . 22 from bartelmann & stienmetz ( 1996 )",
    ", we get a mass of @xmath70 .",
    "this agrees well with the mass we derive from the m - t relation .",
    "following a line of reasoning similar to that used in d98 , we determine the expected number density of clusters like ms  1054 in an @xmath5 = 1 universe with initial gaussian perturbations and compare this with the observed number density for detection in the emss .",
    "the comoving mass density of virialized objects with masses greater than @xmath71 is given by the press - schechter formula @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the current matter density , and @xmath74 is the critical threshold at which perturbations virialize ( press & schechter 1974 , d98 ) .",
    "we conservatively take the temperature of ms  1054 to be greater than 8.5 kev ; d98 used 10 kev for this calculation .",
    "the cluster mass is then at least @xmath6 . the current number density of clusters of a given mass has been estimated from both observations and simulations ( bahcall & cen 1992 , eke et al .",
    "1996 , bahcall et al .",
    "we will use the results of bahcall et al .",
    "( 1997 ) as they give us the highest number density .",
    "we , therefore , find that at @xmath75 the number density is less than @xmath76 mpc@xmath77 .",
    "the mass density is then approximately @xmath78 mpc@xmath77 .    from the press - schechter formula with this mass density , @xmath79 is greater than 3.13 .",
    "if @xmath5 = 1 , @xmath74 is proportional to ( 1+z ) , and @xmath80 is greater than 5.72 for clusters with @xmath81 kev .",
    "this corresponds to a mean virialized mass density of like clusters at z=0.83 less than @xmath82 mpc@xmath77 , and a number density less than @xmath83 mpc@xmath77 .",
    "however , detection of ms  1054 in the emss gives a density of like clusters of @xmath84 mpc@xmath77 ( d98 ) .",
    "this exceeds our prediction for an @xmath5 = 1 universe with gaussian perturbations by a factor of more than @xmath85 .",
    "although the lower _ chandra _ temperature gives an expected number density a factor of 15 higher than that found in d98 , it does not change their conclusion that @xmath5 = 1 is very unlikely .",
    "donahue and voit ( 1999 ) fit for @xmath5 using three cluster samples with different redshift ranges .",
    "they find @xmath86 for an open universe and @xmath87 for a flat universe .",
    "these results are unaffected by the lower temperature for ms  1054 .",
    "in fact , with a temperature of 10 kev , ms  1054 appears to lie closer to the best fit temperature function for the high redshift sample .",
    "the _ chandra _ observation of the cluster ms  1054@xmath00321 at z = 0.83 indicates that it has an x - ray temperature of @xmath1 kev .",
    "this is somewhat lower than , but consistent with , the temperature of @xmath11 kev previously found from the _ asca _ data ( d98 ) .",
    "we are also able to make the first positive identification of an iron line in this cluster and find a value of @xmath2 for the abundance relative to solar ( anders & grevessa 1989 ) .",
    "the detection of iron in a cluster at this redshift is consistent with early enrichment of the icm ( mushotzky & loewenstein 1997 ) .",
    "_ chandra _ was able to resolve substructure in ms  1054 , confirming the substructure in the _ rosat / hri _ observation , and to identify a number of point sources surrounding it , a task beyond the spatial resolution of the _ rosat / hri_. the x - ray distribution appears to have two clumps .",
    "for the eastern clump , probably associated with the main cluster component , we find an x - ray temperature of @xmath3 kev .",
    "for the western clump we find a slightly lower temperature of @xmath4 kev .",
    "the best - fit redshift of this second clump corresponds to the cluster redshift , and it may be a subgroup falling into the cluster .",
    "the hardness ratio map shows no evidence of a shock between the two clumps ; however , comparison of the x - ray contours with the hubble image and weak lensing mass reconstruction may indicate that the gas in the subclump is being stripped off as it falls into the cluster .",
    "we do not detect a third clump seen in the weak lensing derived mass distribution .    in this work ,",
    "we confirm , along with the weak lensing and velocity dispersion data , that ms  1054 is truly a massive cluster . with _",
    "s resolution , we are able for the first time to determine the temperature of different regions of the cluster .",
    "this allows us to confirm that the entire cluster is hot , and that we are not measuring an anomalously high temperature due to a small shock - heated region . with",
    "chandra _ , we are also able to quantify the point source contamination and remove it from the data when determining the temperature .",
    "the velocity dispersion derived from our temperature is in good agreement with the observed velocity dispersion and weak lensing estimates , although our mass estimate is somewhat lower than the masses derived from these methods ( tran et al .",
    "1999 ; hoekstra et al .",
    "the lower x - ray temperature from _ chandra _ of course leads to a smaller derived virial mass than the _ asca _ estimate .",

    "<S> we observed ms  1054@xmath00321 , the highest redshift cluster of galaxies in the _ einstein _ medium sensitivity survey ( emss ) , with the _ chandra _ acis - s detector . </S>",
    "<S> we find the x - ray temperature of the cluster to be @xmath1 kev , lower than , but statistically consistent with , the temperature inferred previously . </S>",
    "<S> this temperature agrees well with the observed velocity dispersion and that found from weak lensing . </S>",
    "<S> we are also able to make the first positive identification of an iron line in this cluster and find a value of @xmath2 for the abundance relative to solar , consistent with early enrichment of the icm . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm significant substructure in the form of two distinct clumps in the x - ray distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the eastern clump seems to coincide with the main cluster component . </S>",
    "<S> it has a temperature of @xmath3 kev , approximately the same as the average spectral temperature for the whole cluster . </S>",
    "<S> the western clump is cooler , with a temperature of @xmath4 and may be a subgroup falling into the cluster . though the presence of substructure indicates that this cluster is not fully relaxed , cluster simulations suggest that we will underestimate the mass , and we can , therefore , use the mass to constrain @xmath5 . from the overall cluster x - ray temperature we find the virial mass of the cluster to be at least @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> we revisit the cosmological implications of the existence of such a hot , massive cluster at a relatively early epoch . despite the lower temperature </S>",
    "<S> , we still find that the existence of this cluster constrains @xmath5 to be less than one . if @xmath7 and assuming gaussian initial perturbations , we find the probability of observing ms  1054 in the emss is @xmath8 . </S>"
