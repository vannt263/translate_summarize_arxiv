    "cropper etal . ( 1998 ) reported x - ray observations obtained using _ rosat _ of the x - ray source rx j1914 + 24 discovered by motch etal .",
    "( 1996 ) and attribute the 569 sec period they detected to the binary orbital period .",
    "this would make it the shortest orbital period of any known binary system . from the absence of any other x - ray period and the shape of the folded x - ray light curve , they suggest that rx j1914 + 24 is the first double degenerate polar to be discovered , rather than the other possibility that it is an intermediate polar .",
    "this paper gives the preliminary results of our search for the optical counterpart of rx j1914 + 24 and our initial analysis of our _ asca _ x - ray spectrum of rx j1914 + 24 .",
    "cropper etal . ( 1998 ) found that rx j1914 + 24 was closest to star h in the finding chart of motch etal .",
    "motch etal .",
    "indicate that star h is heavily reddened and not visible in @xmath1 .",
    "we therefore obtained a service image of rx j1914 + 24 in @xmath2 taken using ukirt in oct 1997 and found that star h is made up of more than 1 star .",
    "follow - up observations were obtained between 2527 june 1998 using the not on la palma .",
    "polarimetry observations were made in the @xmath0 band : o and e rays were separated by @xmath3 on the same ccd ( fig [ noti ] ) .",
    "photometry of stars in the field was obtained using profile fitting .",
    "as the profiles of the stars in the two rays were different , photometry was obtained on each set of images .",
    "our not photometry showed that the brightest of the stars making up star ` h ' was the optical counterpart of rx j1914 + 24 .",
    "the mean magnitude was @xmath418.2 : @xmath51.6 mag fainter than found by motch etal .",
    "( 1996 ) in june 1993 .",
    "there is no evidence that rx j1914 + 24 is significantly circularly polarised .",
    "in addition to these @xmath0 band data , @xmath6 band data taken using ukirt the following week have still to be analysed .",
    "( 6,5 ) ( 12,18 . )",
    "cropper etal . ( 1998 ) showed _ rosat _ data from 3 distinct epochs . since then we have obtained another set of _ rosat _ data .",
    "we have been able to derive an accurate ephemeris using the start of the increase in x - ray flux to define @xmath7=0.0 ( t@xmath8= hjd 2449258.03941(6 ) + 0.0065902334(4 ) ) .",
    "fig [ fold ] shows all our _ rosat _ data folded on this ephemeris .",
    "this shows that there has been a gradual decrease in x - ray flux from sept 1993 to oct 1997 ( fig [ fold ] ) .",
    "in other respects the light curves are similar in that they all show zero flux for @xmath5 half the 569 sec period .",
    "a power spectrum of our @xmath0 band photometry indicates that only one period ( the 569 sec period seen in x - rays ) is present ( fig [ power ] ) .",
    "we show the @xmath0 band data folded using all 3 nights of data in the bottom panel of fig [ fold ] using the above ephemeris ( which is sufficiently accurate to match the phasing to within 0.02 cycles ) .",
    "the folded data is roughly sinusoidal in shape .",
    "interestingly , the peak precedes the x - ray peak by @xmath90.4 .",
    "( 8,8 ) ( -2,-2 . )    ( 8,5 ) ( -4,-32 . )",
    "we obtained a 20ksec observation of rx j1914 + 24 in april 1998 .",
    "rx j1914 + 24 was detected only in the sis and only below 1kev .",
    "its spectrum ( fig [ asca ] ) could be well fitted with a low temperature ( @xmath1040ev ) blackbody plus interstellar absorption ( n@xmath11 @xmath12 ) .",
    "the @xmath13 upper limit to a thermal bremsstrahlung component ( assumed temperature 20kev ) corresponds to a @xmath14 kev flux of @xmath15 erg/@xmath16/s ( @xmath17 erg / s at 100 pc ) .",
    "this is typical of a polar .",
    "x - ray spectra of intermediate polars are typically much harder .",
    "( 8,7 ) ( -5,-6 . )",
    "we have detected the optical counterpart of rx j1914 + 24 .",
    "we find only one period in its @xmath0 band folded optical light curve ( the same 569 sec period we find in x - rays ) .",
    "when we folded this data on the 569 sec period we obtain a quasi - sinusoidal modulation offset in phase compared with the x - rays . the fact that we detect only one period , together with the very soft _ asca _",
    "spectrum is further evidence in favour of the interpretation that rx j1914 + 24 is a double degenerate polar .",
    "a detailed paper is in preparation ."
