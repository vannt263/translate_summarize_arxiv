    "the number of tev blazars has grown rapidly in recent years ( see , e.g. , the reviews of holder 2012 , 2014 ) with 54 tev blazars currently known .",
    "the vast majority of these ( 44 of 54 , or about 80% ) belong to the blazar sub - class of high - frequency peaked bl lac objects , or hbls .",
    "several of these tev hbls have displayed remarkable variability in their tev gamma - ray emission on time scales as short as a few minutes ( e.g. , aharonian et al .  2007 ; albert et al .",
    "2007 ; sakamoto et al .  2008 ) .",
    "although various explanations have been proposed for such rapid variability ( e.g. , begelman et al .",
    "2008 ; nalewajko et al .",
    "2011 ; narayan & piran 2012 ; barkov et al .",
    "2012 ) , they share the common feature of high bulk lorentz factors of at least @xmath625 for the gamma - ray emitting plasma in their relativistic jets .",
    "high bulk lorentz factors and doppler factors are also required to model tev blazar spectral energy distributions ( e.g. , tavecchio et al .  2010 ) , particularly in the case of one - zone models .",
    "for example , fitting the sed of the tev blazar pks  1424 + 240 with a one - zone model yields a doppler factor of @xmath7 ( aleksi , et al .",
    "2014a ) .",
    "direct imaging of the jets of these blazars on parsec - scales requires vlbi .",
    "most hbls are relatively faint in the radio , so the tev hbls are not well represented in large vlbi monitoring projects , such as mojave ( lister et al .",
    "we have previously reported multi - epoch vlbi kinematic results for 11 established tev hbls ( piner et al .",
    "2010 ; tiet et al .",
    "a major result of those kinematic analyses was the absence of any rapidly moving features in the jets of those blazars ; all components in all 11 sources were either stationary or slowly moving ( @xmath81@xmath9 ) .",
    "slow apparent speeds of vlbi components in specific tev hbls has been confirmed by numerous other studies ( e.g. , giroletti et al .",
    "2004a ; lico et al .  2012",
    "; blasi et al .  2013 ; aleksi et al .  2013 ; richards et al .  2013 ) , although note that tev - detected intermediate - peaked bl lac objects ( ibls ) , such as 3c 66a and bl lac , do show apparently superluminal components ( e.g. , britzen et al .  2008 ) .",
    "while effects other than slow bulk motion can produce slow apparent speeds of components , the complete absence of any rapidly moving features in all of these jets , after as much as 20 years of vlba monitoring ( for mrk 421 and mrk 501 ) , and even after powerful flares ( richards et al .",
    "2013 ) , is quite distinct from the behavior of other types of gamma - ray blazars , which show frequent superluminal ejections ( e.g. , lister et al .",
    "2009 ; marscher 2013 ) . taken together with other measured radio properties , such as the brightness temperatures and core dominance ( giroletti et al",
    ".  2004b ; lister et al .",
    "2011 ) , the vlbi data imply only modest bulk lorentz factors and doppler factors in the parsec - scale radio jets of these tev hbls .",
    "( note that , because the sources appear one - sided on parsec scales , the vlbi data do require that the sources be at least moderately relativistic . )",
    "this discrepancy between the doppler and lorentz factors estimated from the gamma - ray data and the radio date has been referred to as the `` doppler crisis '' of tev blazars .",
    "a natural explanation for the doppler crisis is that the radio and gamma - ray emission may be produced in different parts of the jet with different bulk lorentz factors .",
    "several variations of such a multi - component jet have been proposed including decelerating jets ( georganopoulos & kazanas 2003 ) , spine - sheath structures ( ghisellini et al .",
    "2005 ) , ` minijets ' within the main jet ( giannios et al .",
    "2009 ) , and faster moving leading edges of blobs ( lyutikov & lister 2010 ) , but they all require that the jets of hbls contain significant velocity structures .",
    "some of these velocity structures , such as a fast spine and slower layer , may under certain conditions produce observable signatures in vlbi images , such as limb brightening of the transverse jet structure .",
    "limb brightening has indeed been observed in vlbi images of the bright tev blazars mrk 421 and mrk 501 ( e.g. , giroletti et al .",
    "2004a , 2006 , 2008 ; piner et al .  2009 , 2010 ;",
    "croke et al .",
    "2010 ; blasi et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "these arguments for velocity structures in the jets of tev hbls are independently supported by developments in radio - loud agn unification ( meyer et al .",
    "2011 , 2013a ; see also ghisellini et al .",
    "2009 ) . in that unification work ,",
    "radio - loud agn are divided into two distinct sub - populations that constitute a ` broken power sequence ' .",
    "the ` weak ' jet sub - population resulting from inefficient accretion modes ( and corresponding to hbls when viewed at a small angle ) follows a de - beaming curve that requires velocity gradients in the jets , such as a decelerating or spine - sheath jet ; see also the similar arguments in earlier unification work ( chiaberge et al .",
    "the tev hbls may thus represent the small viewing angle peak of a distinct radio - loud population with both fundamentally different jet structure and accretion mode from the more powerful blazars .",
    "if this is the case , then obtaining more information on the parsec - scale structure of these sources through high - resolution imaging is quite important .",
    "we are presently taking advantage of both the rapidly growing tev blazar source list and the recently upgraded sensitivity of the very long baseline array ( vlba ) to significantly expand our previous work on the parsec - scale structure of tev hbls ( e.g. , piner et al .",
    "2010 ; tiet et al .",
    "2012 ) . here",
    ", we present first - epoch vlba images of twenty newer tev hbls discovered during the years 2006 to 2013 , several of which had never been imaged with vlbi .",
    "this represents the first stage of a multi - epoch vlba monitoring program on these sources designed to provide parsec - scale kinematic and structural information on nearly the complete sample of tev hbls . in @xmath10  [ observations ]",
    "we describe the source selection and observations , in @xmath10  [ results20 ] we present the results for these observations , and in @xmath10  [ resultsall ] we extend consideration to the full set of tev hbls .",
    "final discussion and conclusions are given in @xmath10  [ discussion ] .",
    "we have been conducting vlba observations of tev - detected hbls since the discovery of the first two tev blazars ( mrk  421 and mrk  501 ) in the 1990s , in order to study their jet physics through high - resolution parsec - scale imaging ( see @xmath10  [ intro ] ) .",
    "our complete candidate source list is thus the 44 hbls listed as detections in the tevcat catalog as of this writing . from those 44 sources we excluded the following for the observations in this paper :    1 .",
    "eleven sources reported as tev detections before 2007 for which we have already published multi - epoch vlba observations : six of these sources are discussed by piner et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , and an additional five by tiet et al .",
    "2 .   seven sources with sufficient multi - epoch vlba data in the mojave monitoring program .",
    "three sources which are below @xmath11 declination , and thus difficult to image with the vlba .",
    "two sources which were detected too recently ( after 2013 ) to be included in this work .",
    "the low brightness temperature source hess  j1943 + 213 ( gabnyi et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "these exclusions are shown in tabular from in table  [ selecttab ] , and they leave 20 hbls ( or nearly half of the full sample ) that were all reported as new detections by the tev telescopes between 2006 and 2013 , and that have not yet been studied with multi - epoch vlbi imaging by any program . the goal of the observations presented here is to provide high - dynamic range single - epoch images of these 20 sources , as a precursor to a multi - epoch monitoring program to study the jet kinematics .",

    "2010 ) , but it is now established for a much larger number of sources . to compare with intrinsic brightness temperature limits that have been derived for homogeneous optically thick spheres , we can convert our gaussian brightness temperatures to homogeneous sphere brightness temperatures by multiplying by the appropriate correction factor of 0.56 ( e.g. , pearson 1995 ; tingay et al .",
    "this yields a value of about @xmath53  k as a typical brightness temperature of a tev hbl .    comparing the typical observed brightness temperatures to the equipartition brightness temperatures calculated for these sources of about @xmath54  k ( equation  4@xmath15 of readhead 1994 )",
    ", we see that the observed brightness temperatures of these tev hbls are already at or below the equipartition limit with no need to invoke high doppler factors to reduce the observed brightness temperatures .",
    "there is thus no evidence of relativistic beaming of the core emission based on the vlbi brightness temperatures .",
    "even with no doppler boosting , the observed brightness temperatures are already somewhat below the equipartition value , placing these sources in the magnetically - dominated regime ( readhead 1994 ; homan et al .",
    "high values of the doppler factor would reduce the intrinsic brightness temperature even more , placing the sources even farther from equipartition .",
    "we note one important caveat : that both observed brightness temperatures and intrinsic physical limits are traditionally calculated for a homogeneous sphere geometry , and that the actual geometry for the vlbi core region may be more complex , such as a partially - resolved limb - brightened structure ( see @xmath10  [ transverse ] ) .    despite the lack of evidence for beaming from the vlbi brightness temperatures ,",
    "the one - sided core - jet morphology displayed by the majority of these sources does imply at least mild doppler boosting .",
    "however , because the sources studied in this paper are relatively faint , this constraint is modest .",
    "we have computed lower limits to the jet - to - counterjet brightness ratio for each source , based on the peak jet brightness from the model fits in table  [ mfittab ] restored with the associated beam from table  [ imtab ] , and using three times the rms noise from table  [ imtab ] as the minimum detectable counterjet brightness . the median lower limit to the jet - to - counterjet brightness ratio is 37:1 , which implies @xmath55 for viewing angles of a few degrees .",
    "the highest lower limit is 210:1 for 1741 + 196 , which implies @xmath56 and @xmath57 for viewing angles of a few degrees .",

    "the ovro program s chosen parameter to characterize variability is the ` intrinsic modulation index ' , @xmath92 , which is an estimate of the standard deviation of the source flux density divided by its mean ( richards et al .",
    "2011 , 2014 ) . although many of the tev hbls are in the ovro program , because of their relative faintness they are clustered near the program s measurement limits in flux density and modulation index .",
    "for example , although 25 of the tev hbls in table  [ alltab ] are in table  1 of richards et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , 6 do not have a measured modulation index , and another 9 have a flux density and modulation index that are excluded from the analysis for being too close to the measurement limits . the 10 remaining high - confidence modulation indices are tabulated with the other source data in table  [ alltab ] .",
    "because only 10 tev hbls pass the current data cuts in the ovro analysis , we do not attempt correlation studies with the modulation index here , but leave it as an interesting possibility for future study if thresholds for the ovro variability analysis are lowered .",
    "we have investigated the parsec - scale jet structure of twenty relatively newly discovered tev hbls that had not been previously well - studied with vlbi .",
    "these newly discovered tev hbls extend down to only a few millijanskys in flux density , so they are not present in large vlbi monitoring programs .",
    "all sources were detected and imaged , and all showed parsec - scale jets that could be modeled with at least one gaussian component ( @xmath10  [ mfits ] ) .",
    "most sources had a one - sided core - jet morphology , although we find two cases of apparently two - sided structure ( @xmath10  [ images ] ) .",
    "many sources show a common morphology of a collimated jet a few milliarcseconds long that transitions to a lower surface brightness , more diffuse jet with a broader opening angle at a few mas from the core .",
    "these results show that the entire tev hbl sample , although relatively faint in the radio , is accessible to analysis with current vlbi instruments .    as well as",
    "can be determined from only single - epoch images , the analyses presented here support previous conclusions that lorentz factors in the parsec - scale cores and jets of tev hbls are only modestly relativistic .",
    "we determined allowed brightness temperature ranges for each core component ( @xmath10  [ tb ] ) , and found that roughly half of the vlbi cores are resolved with brightness temperature upper limits of a few times @xmath3  k ( table  [ tbtab ] ) .",
    "a gaussian brightness temperature of @xmath63  k was consistent with the data for all but one of the sources .",
    "such brightness temperatures do not require any relativistic beaming to reduce them below likely intrinsic limits .",
    "the lack of detection of counter - jets does place at least a modest limit on the bulk lorentz factor , although the strongest such constraint we could place was @xmath5 .",
    "the distribution of apparent opening angles ( @xmath10  [ opening ] ) is indistinguishable from that of the general gamma - ray blazar population ( pushkarev et al .",
    "2009 ; lister et al .",
    "2011 ) , so there is no indication from their jet morphology that these sources are unusually close to the line - of - sight compared to other gamma - ray blazars . there is thus no evidence from these images that the slow apparent speeds of tev hbls are caused by a much closer alignment to the line - of - sight compared to the apparently faster sources .",
    "the ` doppler crisis ' for tev hbls suggests that their parsec - scale jets are structurally more complex than those of the more powerful blazars , and that they require at least two zones of significantly different lorentz factor to successfully describe them .",
    "a consistent picture is emerging of this dichotomy in the jetted agn population based on multiwavelength studies of large populations , theoretical modeling , and high - resolution imaging with vlbi . in this picture , jets formed in a low - efficiency accretion mode typical of hbls ( ghisellini et al .",
    "2005 , 2009 ; meyer et al .",
    "2013b ) favor interaction of the jet walls with the external medium , causing the formation of a slow layer .",
    "radiative interaction between the spine and the layer may then decelerate the spine ( ghisellini et al .",
    "2005 ) , producing longitudinal as well as transverse velocity structure , such as postulated by georganopoulos & kazanas ( 2003 ) .",
    "application of such two - zone models can also be successful in reducing the most extreme doppler factors sometimes required by one - zone models .",
    "for example , for the tev blazar pks  1424 + 240 , fitting the sed with a one - zone model yields a doppler factor of @xmath1 , while the mojave vlba data imply a doppler factor of only @xmath0 ( aleksi , et al .",
    "when the same sed is fit by the two - zone model of tavecchio et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , the doppler factor of the fast zone is reduced to @xmath93 , while that of the slower zone has the vlba - derived value of @xmath0 ( aleksi , et al .",
    "2014a ) .",
    "vlbi imaging might detect such two - zone spine - layer jets through observations of transverse emission structures such as limb brightening .",
    "we do observe limb brightening in two sources ( see @xmath10  [ transverse ] ) , although for the majority of sources the transverse structure is either unresolved , or it is patchy and complex with multiple emission peaks .",
    "however , we note that , because of increased source distance and lower observing frequency , the observations in this paper have about an order of magnitude worse linear resolution compared to the high - frequency observations of limb - brightening in the nearby bright tev blazars mrk  421 and mrk  501 ( e.g. , piner et al .  2009 , 2010 ) .    in the spine - layer model for tev hbls ,",
    "the tev emission comes from the spine while the radio emission comes from the layer , causing different lorentz factors to be measured in the two spectral bands .",
    "however , for tev radio galaxies , both the gamma - ray and the radio emission can be dominated by the layer ( ghisellini et al .",
    "2005 ) , so that consistent lorentz factors might be expected ( no ` doppler crisis ' ) .",
    "vlbi observations of the three known tev radio galaxies m87 ( e.g. , hada et al .  2014 ) , cen  a ( e.g. , mller et al .  2014 ) , and 3c  84 ( e.g. , nagai et al .",
    "2014 ) can therefore provide consistency checks on spine - layer models ( e.g. , tavecchio & ghisellini 2008 , 2014 ) .",
    "we extended our consideration to the full sample of tev hbls in @xmath10  [ resultsall ] , by combining our vlbi data on 20 sources from this paper with other vlbi and gamma - ray data from the literature . following the approach of lister et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , we constructed a gamma - ray loudness parameter for the tev hbls ( @xmath10  [ loudness ] ) , and found that it spans about two orders of magnitude from extreme gamma - ray loud sources like h  1426 + 428 to more radio - loud sources like pks  0301@xmath14243 .",
    "there is a significant apparent partial correlation ( excluding effects of redshift ) between the vlbi and tev fluxes ( @xmath10  [ correlations ] ) , although monte carlo simulations using the method of pavlidou et al .  ( 2012 ) showed that this correlation may intrinsically be only marginally significant .",
    "such a correlation might suggest that doppler factors in different jet emission regions are correlated , even if they are significantly different , such as occurs in the model by lyutikov & lister ( 2010 ) .",
    "note that vlbi core flares correlated with gamma - ray flares in mrk  421 ( richards et al .",
    "2013 ) also suggest a link between the vlbi emission and the gamma - ray emission in that source .",
    "much more information about the jet kinematics of the tev hbls should be revealed through the multi - epoch vlba monitoring of these 20 sources that is currently underway .",
    "at least three additional epochs for each of these sources has been approved on the vlba , and should be obtained over the next one to two years , in addition to high - frequency imaging of some of the brighter tev hbls to investigate transverse jet structures . when added to the 11 tev hbls that we have already monitored , and the 7 additional tev hbls being monitored by mojave",
    ", this will make information on parsec - scale structural changes available for @xmath94 of the currently known tev hbl population .",
    "this is a crucial step toward understanding the jet structure of this group of sources , as the high - energy community looks forward to many more such objects being detected by future tev telescopes like the cherenkov telescope array ( cta ) .",
    "the national radio astronomy observatory is a facility of the national science foundation operated under cooperative agreement by associated universities , inc .",
