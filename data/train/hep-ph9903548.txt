    "this paper summarizes the work done for the tevatron run ii higgs / supersymmetry workshop  @xcite on the supersymmetry models with gauge mediation / low scale supersymmetry breaking  ( gmsb )  @xcite .",
    "six final states in which new physics might manifest itself are investigated using the parameters of the upgraded d   detector  @xcite .",
    "all of these final states are expected to have small physics and instrumentation backgrounds .",
    "implications of the analyses of these final states in future tevatron runs on the minimal ( and not - so - minimal ) gmsb models are discussed .",
    "estimated discovery reaches in the supersymmetry parameter space are presented .",
    "due to a large number of monte carlo  ( mc ) events generated , no detector simulation is done for supersymmetry signals .",
    "all studies described in this paper except those extrapolated from run  i analyses are carried out at the particle level of the isajet mc program  @xcite . a 2  tev tevatron center - of - mass energy",
    "is assumed throughout the studies .",
    "leptons ( @xmath2 ) and photons ( @xmath3 ) are ` reconstructed ' from the generated particle list by requiring them to have transverse energy ( @xmath4 ) or momentum ( @xmath5 ) greater than 5  gev and to be within the pseudorapidity ranges :    * @xmath6 : @xmath7 or @xmath8 ; * @xmath9 : @xmath10 ; * @xmath3 : @xmath7 or @xmath8 .",
    "these fiducial ranges are dictated by the coverages of the electromagnetic calorimeter and the central tracker of the d  detector .",
    "furthermore , the leptons and photons must be isolated .",
    "additional energy in a cone with a radius @xmath11 in @xmath12 space around the lepton / photon is required to be less than 20% of its energy .",
    "jets are reconstructed using a cone algorithm with a radius @xmath13 in @xmath12 space and are required to have @xmath14  gev and @xmath15 . all particles except neutrinos",
    ", the lightest supersymmetric particles ( lsp ) , and the identified leptons and photons are used in the jet reconstruction .",
    "the transverse momentum imbalance ( @xmath16 ) is defined to be the total transverse energy of neutrinos and the lsps .",
    "energies or momenta of leptons , photons and jets of monte carlo events are taken from their particle level values without any detector effect .",
    "smearing of energies or momenta of leptons , photons and jets according to their expected resolution typically changes signal efficiencies by less than 10% relatively and therefore has negligible effect on the study .",
    "the reconstruction efficiencies are assumed to be 90% for leptons and photons .",
    "for the purpose of background estimations , the probability ( @xmath17 ) for a jet to be misidentified as a lepton ( @xmath18 ) or a photon ( @xmath19 ) is assumed to be @xmath20 .",
    "the probability for an electron to be misidentified as a photon ( @xmath21 ) is assumed to be @xmath22 , these probabilities are a factor of three or more smaller than those obtained in run  i  , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 . ] . with a new magnetic central tracking system and a fine - segmented preshower detector",
    ", they should be achievable in run  ii .    in run",
    "i , tagging of b - jets was limited to the use of soft muons in d .",
    "secondary vertex tagging of b - jets will be a powerful addition in run  ii .",
    "for the studies described below , a tagging efficiency of 60% is assumed for those b - jets with @xmath25  gev and @xmath26 .",
    "the probability @xmath27 for a light - quark or gluon jet to be tagged as a b - jet is assumed to be @xmath28 .",
    "these numbers are optimistic extrapolations of what cdf achieved in run  i.    heavy stable charged particles can be identified  @xcite using their expected large ionization energy losses ( @xmath29 ) in the silicon detector , fiber tracker , preshower detectors and calorimeter .",
    "based on ref .",
    "@xcite , a generic @xmath29 cut is introduced with an efficiency of 68% for heavy stable charged particles and a rejection factor of 10 for the minimum ionization particles  ( mip ) .",
    "note that the efficiency for identifying at least one such particle in events with two heavy stable charged particles is 90% .    with the addition of preshower detectors , d  will be able to reconstruct the distance of the closest approach  ( dca ) of a photon with a resolution @xmath30  cm  @xcite . here",
    "the dca is defined as the distance between the primary event vertex and the reconstructed photon direction .",
    "thereby it will enable us to identify photons produced at secondary vertices .",
    "in the following , a photon is called displaced if its dca is greater than 5.0  cm and is denoted by @xmath31 .",
    "we further assume that the probability for a photon produced at the primary vertex to have the measured dca@xmath32  cm is @xmath33 ( about @xmath34 ) .",
    "all final states studied have large @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) leptons / photons with or without large @xmath16 . triggering on these events",
    "are not expected to have any problem .",
    "nevertheless , we assume a 90% trigger efficiency for all the final states .",
    "signatures for supersymmetry vary dramatically from one model to another",
    ". they can also be very different for different regions of the parameter space in a model .",
    "furthermore , these signatures are generally not unique to supersymmetry .",
    "in fact , some of the signatures are also expected from other theories beyond the standard model . instead of chasing after theoretical models ( all of which except perhaps one are wrong anyway ) a set of final states which are somewhat generic to many new physics models , including supersymmetric models , is identified .",
    "all of these final states are characterized by high @xmath4(@xmath5 ) isolated leptons / photons with or without large missing transverse momentum and are thus expected to have small physics and instrumental backgrounds . in the following ,",
    "we discuss selection criteria and estimate observable background cross sections for six such final states :    [ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]     if an excess is seen in the @xmath35  final state , it will be of great interest to reconstruct the di - jet invariant mass . figure  [ fig : p5mjj ] shows the invariant mass distribution of the two leading jets for @xmath36  tev and @xmath37=2  fb@xmath1 . a mass peak around @xmath38  gev is clearly identifiable .",
    "the asymmetry in the mass distribution is partly due to @xmath39 contribution and partly due to the effect of gluon radiation and the energy outside the jet cone .",
    "in this paper , observable background cross sections for the six final states in which new physics might manifest itself are estimated .",
    "all the final states studied are found to have small backgrounds .",
    "implications of the analyses of these final states for future tevatron runs are discussed in the framework of gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking models .",
    "potential discovery reaches in supersymmetry parameter space for integrated luminosities of 2 and 30  fb@xmath1 are examined for models with different nlsp .",
    "though the selection criteria are not optimized for the models discussed and not all final states are investigated , the study does show that the upgraded d  experiment at the improved tevatron collider has great potentials for discovery .",
