    "equilibrium sequences of rapidly rotating neutron stars are important in modelling a variety of phenomena of astrophysical interest , such as millisecond pulsars , low  mass x  ray binaries ( lmxbs ) and quasi periodic oscillators ( qpos ) .",
    "models of rapidly rotating neutron stars in general relativity must be constructed numerically . early work on this have been based on incompressible fluids and polytropic models ( bonazzola & schneider 1974 ; butterworth 1976 ) . in 1986 friedman et al .",
    "( 1986 ) reported calculations of rapidly rotating neutron stars in general relativity using a set of realistic equations of state ( eos ) for neutron star matter . a similar work based on a formalism due to komatsu et al .",
    "( 1989 ) ( keh formalism ) was done by cook et al .",
    "( 1994 ) for purpose of studying quasi  stationary evolution of isolated neutron stars .",
    "an alternative approach based on spectral methods was developed by bonazzola et al .",
    "extensive calculations using the spectral method for a broad set of realistic eos of neutron star matter were presented in salgado et al .",
    "( 1994a ; 1994b ) .",
    "a key input in determining the structure of neutron stars is the eos of high density matter .",
    "the work of friedman et al .",
    "( 1986 ) and that of cook et al .",
    "( 1994 ) make abundantly clear that the eos also plays a significant role in deciding the various equilibrium sequences of rotating neutron stars .",
    "for example , the keplerian frequency of a test particle in orbit around a neutron star ranges from 55% of its spherical value for models based on the softest eos to 75% of the spherical value for models with the stiffest eos .",
    "the spreads in rotation  induced changes in the values of masses and radii from static neutron star cases also display considerable eos dependence .",
    "these quantities ( especially the keplerian frequency of a particle in orbit around the rotating neutron star and the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit ) are important for deciding the boundary layer structure and hence the emission characteristic of lmxb and qpos .",
    "although dense matter has been a subject of study for nearly three decades now , there is no general agreement still on its exact composition , and on its eos , especially for densities in excess several times nuclear matter density .",
    "the bulk of a neutron star ( _ core _ ) is made up of an electrically neutral quantum fluid composed of neutrons , protons , electrons and muons in equilibrium with respect to the weak interactions ( beta  stable nuclear matter ) .",
    "however , at ultra  high densities , a variety of new and exotic hadronic degrees of freedom may become important ( like hyperons , a @xmath1 condensate or a deconfined phase of quark matter ) .",
    "the possible appearance of such an exotic core has enormous consequences for the transport properties of neutron stars and also for the formation of black holes ( brown & bethe 1994 ; bombaci 1996 ) .",
    "the consequences of the existence of an exotic core ( such as quark matter or kaon condensation ) on the properties of rapidly rotating neutron stars will be reported in a forthcoming paper ( datta et al .",
    "1997 ) . in the present work",
    ", we have considered a conventional picture assuming the neutron star core to be composed of only beta  stable nuclear matter . even in this picture , the determination of the eos of asymmetric nuclear matter to describe the core of the neutron star , remains a formidable theoretical problem .",
    "in fact , one has to extrapolate the eos to extreme conditions of high density and high neutron ",
    "proton asymmetry , _",
    "i.e. _ in a regime where the eos is poorly constrained by nuclear data and experiments .",
    "astrophysical observational data , such as based on the binary pulsar psr 1913 + 16 , which give @xmath2  @xmath3as the mass of the neutron star in the binary ( taylor & weisberg 1989 ) and analysis of vela pulsar postglitch timing data can be used to broadly rule out very soft eos ( datta & alpar 1993 ) .",
    "recently , some new eos of asymmetric nuclear matter have been calculated and applied to the study of non  rotating neutron stars ( baldo et al .",
    "1997 , bombaci 1995 ) .",
    "these eos are based on ( i ) a microscopic brueckner ",
    "goldstone many  body approach and ( ii ) a phenomenological model based on effective nuclear forces .",
    "these satisfy the basic requirements of reproducing the empirical saturation point for symmetric nuclear matter , the symmetry energy and the incompressibility parameter at the saturation density ( see table 1 ) .",
    "these models have the desirable physical feature that the velocity of sound in the medium does not violate the causality condition .",
    "therefore , these can be taken to be _ realistic _ eos , and",
    "so it would be of interest to see the equilibrium rotating sequences that would be possible with these eos . in this paper",
    "we report calculations of equilibrium sequences of rapidly rotating neutron stars in general relativity for these new realistic eos models .",
    "the various equilibrium sequences that we construct are normal and supramassive evolutionary sequences of constant rest mass .",
    "in addition , we build equilibrium sequences for a constant value of rotation rate corresponding to a period of @xmath4  ms of the millisecond pulsar psr 1937 + 21 ( backer et al .",
    "1982 ) , the most rapidly rotating pulsar known .",
    "the space  time around a rotating neutron star can be described in quasi ",
    "isotropic coordinates , as a generalization of bardeen s metric ( bardeen 1970 ) :    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the metric tensor . the metric potentials @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and the angular velocity of the stellar fluid relative to the local inertial frame ( @xmath10 ) are all functions of the quasi  isotropic radial coordinate ( @xmath11 ) and the polar angle ( @xmath12 ) .",

    "<S> for four newly suggested realistic equations of state of neutron star matter , we construct equilibrium sequences of rapidly rotating neutron stars in general relativity . </S>",
    "<S> the sequences are the normal and supramassive evolutionary sequences of constant rest mass . </S>",

    "<S> we calculate equilibrium sequences for a constant value of @xmath0 corresponding to the most rapidly rotating pulsar psr 1937 + 21 . </S>",
