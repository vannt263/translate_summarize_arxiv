    "investigation of the oxide conductors has uncovered many interesting electronic states characterized by the strong electron correlation @xcite , which include unconventional superconductivity and anomalous properties in the normal - state @xcite . except for the cuprates @xcite ,",
    "the discovery of superconductivity in the cobaltates @xcite has generated great interest , since the cobaltate is probably the only system other than the cuprates where a doped mott insulator becomes a superconductor .",
    "however , unlike the cuprates that have a square lattice , the cobaltates have a triangular lattice @xcite , where the geometric spin frustration exists . in a doped mott insulator , a central issue in the theory",
    "concerns the nature and topology of the electron fermi surface ( efs ) , since it can be measured experimentally and its shape can have crucial influence on the physical properties .",
    "the first principle band calculations predict that the cobaltates have a large efs centered around the @xmath2 point of the brillouin zone ( bz ) and six small pockets near the @xmath3 points @xcite .",
    "however , the angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) measurements on the cobaltates reveal only the large efs @xcite , while six small efs pockets near the @xmath3 points are absent .",
    "in particular , these arpes experimental data also indicate that the area of efs contains @xmath5 electrons , and therefore fulfills luttinger s theorem @xcite , where @xmath6 is the electron doping concentration . in particular",
    ", there is a remarkable resemblance in the normal- and sc - state properties between the cobaltates and cuprates @xcite , reflecting a fact that the strong electron correlation is common for both these materials @xcite .",
    "it has been originally argued that the strong electron correlation may destroy the one - electron band structure @xcite , however , the observed efs @xcite shows that a momentum - space picture also is an appropriate description of the electronic structure in a doped mott insulator .",
    "the understanding of the nature of efs and its evolution with doping in a doped mott insulator is a necessary step toward understanding of the anomalous normal - state properties of the system and the related superconducting mechanism .",
    "although the evolution of efs with doping in the cobaltates has been well established by now @xcite , its full understanding is still a challenging issue . within the framework of the local - spin - density approximation",
    ", the efs topology in the cobaltates has been studied numerically by taking into account the on - site coulomb interaction @xcite , however , the obtained efs area is twice as large , and therefore is inconsistent with the arpes observations .",
    "based on the multiband hubbard model , the dynamical mean - field ( mf ) numerical simulation indicates that the fermi pockets in the cobaltates become even larger in size than the local density approximation @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the efs topology in a multiorbital hubbard model on a triangular lattice has been studied within the hartree - fock and strong - coupling gutzwiller approximation @xcite , where the obtained quasiparticle dispersion and the efs topology in the presence of the strong on - site coulomb interaction is in qualitative agreement with the arpes measurements on the cobaltates . in particular",
    ", the multiorbital gutzwiller approximation @xcite also shows that the six small pockets near the @xmath3 points predicted by the first principle band calculations are absent due to the strong electron correlation , which pushes the @xmath7 band below the fermi level , leading to an orbital polarized state with a single hexagonal efs .",
    "moreover , the specific efs topology has been discussed within a combined cluster calculation and renormalization group approach @xcite , and then some unusual properties has been explained . in our recent work @xcite , the nature of efs and",
    "its evolution with doping in the cuprates has been studied by taking into account the electron self - energy effect due to the interaction between electrons by the exchange of spin excitations , and the results show clearly that although there is a large efs satisfying luttinger s theorem , the antinodal region of efs is suppressed by the electron self - energy , and then the low - energy electron excitations occupy four disconnected fermi arcs located around the nodal region , in qualitative agreement with the arpes observations @xcite . in particular , our theoretical results @xcite also indicate that the charge - order state in the cuprates @xcite is driven by the fermi - arc instability , with a characteristic wave vector corresponding to the hot spots of the fermi arcs rather than the antinodal nesting vector . in this paper , we study the nature of efs and its evolution with doping in the cobaltates along with this line . in particular , we show that the area enclosed by the hexagonal efs is identical to the total numbers of electrons as expected from luttinger s theorem .",
    "moreover , our theoretical result predicts a fermi - arc phenomenon in the cobaltates at the low - doped regime , where the region of the hexagonal efs along the @xmath2-@xmath3 direction is suppressed by the electron self - energy , leading to that the hexagonal efs is broken into six disconnected fermi arcs centered around the region along the @xmath2-@xmath4 direction .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we present the basic formalism in section [ formalism ] , where we generalize the electron green s function from the previous case of the doped square - lattice mott insulators to the present case for the doped triangular - lattice mott insulators , and then evaluate explicitly the electron spectral function . within this theoretical framework",
    ", we therefore discuss the evolution of efs of the cobaltates with doping in section [ electronic - structure ] .",
    "it is shown that the fermi - arc phenomenon in the cobaltates at the low - doped regime weakens with the increase of doping .",
    "finally , we give a summary in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "following the discovery of the cuprate superconductors @xcite , there were various suggestions of way in which the strongly repulsive hubbard model , or its equivalent , the @xmath0-@xmath1 model can capture the essential physics in a doped mott insulator @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-@xmath1 model consists of two parts , the kinetic energy and magnetic energy parts , respectively .",
    "the kinetic - energy term in the present study includes the electron nearest - neighbor ( nn ) hopping term @xmath0 and next nn hopping term @xmath8 , and therefore it makes electrons itinerant .",
    "in particular , the nn hoping produces efs , while the next nn hoping produces the curvature . on the other hand , the heisenberg magnetic energy term with the nn spin - spin antiferromagnetic ( af ) exchange @xmath1 describes af coupling between localized spins .",
    "the cobaltate is an electron - doped mott insulator @xcite . in this case , the electron - doped @xmath0-@xmath1 model on a triangular lattice is very difficult to analyze , analytically as well as numerically , because of the restriction of the motion of electrons in the restricted hilbert space without zero electron occupancy , i.e. , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) creates ( destroys ) one electron with spin @xmath12 on site @xmath13 . in the hole - doped side , it has been shown that the local constraint of no double electron occupancy can be treated properly within the fermion - spin approach @xcite .",
    "however , to apply this fermion - spin theory to the electron - doped case , we @xcite can work in the hole representation via a particle - hole transformation @xmath14 , with @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) that is the hole creation ( annihilation ) operator , and then the local constraint of no zero electron occupancy in the electron representation @xmath17 is replaced by the local constraint of no double occupancy in the hole representation @xmath18 .",
    "this local constraint of no double occupancy now can be dealt properly by the fermion - spin theory @xcite , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , where the spinful fermion operator @xmath21 keeps track of the charge degree of freedom of the constrained hole together with some effects of spin configuration rearrangements due to the presence of the doped electron itself ( charge carrier ) , while the spin operator @xmath22 represents the spin degree of freedom of the constrained hole , then the local constraint of no double occupancy is satisfied in the actual calculations . in particular , the restriction of no double occupancy in a given site induces a strong coupling between the charge and spin degrees of freedom of the constrained hole , which leads to that the spin configuration in the @xmath0-@xmath1 model is strongly rearranged due to the effect of the charge - carrier hopping on the spins . in the fermion - spin theory , the charge transport is mainly governed by the scattering of charge carriers due to spin fluctuations , while the scattering of spins due to charge - carrier fluctuations dominates the spin dynamics .",
    "based on the triangular - lattice @xmath0-@xmath1 model in the fermion - spin representation , the charge transport of the cobaltates has been discussed @xcite , and the obtained results show that the conductivity spectrum has a low - energy peak and an unusual midinfrared band , while the resistivity is characterized by a crossover from the high - temperature metallic - like to low - temperature insulating - like behavior , in qualitative agreement with the experimental observations @xcite .    for the discussions of the nature of efs and its evolution with doping in the cobaltate",
    ", we need to calculate the electron green s function of the triangular - lattice @xmath0-@xmath1 model , which is defined as @xmath23 .",
    "this electron green s function in the framework of the charge - spin separation is characterized by the charge - spin recombination @xcite , i.e. , the charge and spin degrees of freedom must combine to form the constrained electron . in our recent discussions of the electronic structure of the cuprates ,",
    "we @xcite have developed a full charge - spin recombination scheme , where we have shown that in the doped square - lattice mott insulators , the coupling form between the electron quasiparticle and spin excitation is the same as that between the charge - carrier quasiparticle and spin excitation , and then the obtained electron green s function can give a consistent description of the electronic structure of the cuprates . following our previous discussions for the doped square - lattice mott insulators",

    "an important decoupling parameter @xmath59 has been introduced in the decoupling approximation for the higher order spin green s function , which can be regarded as the vertex correction @xcite .    in this full electron green s function ( [ egf ] ) , the dynamics of an electron quasiparticle at energy @xmath60 and momentum @xmath61 is determined by the scattering processes between the electron quasiparticle itself and the internal spin degree of freedom of the electron with which the electron quasiparticle is coupled .",
    "the scattering processes renormalize the electron quasipaticle energies , and affect the lifetime .",
    "the inverse of the imaginary part of the electron self - energy @xmath29 provides the electron quasiparticle lifetime .",

    "( [ bcsegf ] ) also reflects a fact that in an interacting electron system , the elementary excitation can be described as the electron quasiparticle , but with a quasiparticle coherent weight @xmath73 that decreases as the electron correlation ( then the interaction ) increase , the remaining weight being transferred to the incoherent electron excitations . substituting this electron green s function ( [ bcsegf ] ) and spin bubble ( [ sb ] ) into eq .",

    "we are now ready to discuss the nature of efs and its evolution with doping in the cobaltates . in the cobaltates",
    ", it has been shown experimentally that the value of the effective electron hopping @xmath0 is on the order of the magnetic exchange coupling @xmath1 @xcite , and in this case , the commonly used parameters in this paper are chosen as @xmath87 and @xmath88 for a qualitative discussion .",
    "unless specified , the lattice parameter and reduced planck constant are set to unity .          in the framework of the fermion - spin theory , the quasiparticles of a doped mott insulator consist of bare electrons dressed by spin excitations , and are parameterized by the electron spectral function @xmath89 . in particular , the intensity of the electron spectra at zero energy is used to map out the underlying efs . since the low - energy electron excitations is determined by the electronic structure near efs , the efs topology plays a significant role in comprehending the unconventional physics in a doped mott insulator . for a clear illustration of the effect of the energy and momentum dependence of the electron self - energy on efs in the cobaltates ,",

    "[ spectral - maps]e , the area of the hexagonal efs increases with the increase of the doping concentration , in good agreement with the arpes experimental results @xcite .",
    "the cobaltates have a triangular lattice , where the spin configuration arrangement makes it impossible to minimize the energy on all spins on the lattice sites at the same time - a situation known as the geometrical spin frustration .",
    "however , this triangular - lattice structure induces possibly a geometrical construct for @xmath102-type collective instability .",

    "the fermi - arc phenomenon at the low - doped regime is manifested within the pseudogap regime , then the fermi arcs and pseudogap in the cobaltates are intimately related each other , and they have a root in common originated from the electron self - energy @xmath29 . however , due to the presence of the geometric spin frustration , the strength of the interaction between electrons by the exchange of spin excitations in the cobaltates is much weaker than that in the cuprates , which leads to the pseudogap parameter @xmath114 in the cobaltates is much smaller than that in the cuprates . as a consequence ,",
    "the fermi - arc phenomenon in the cobaltates even at the low - doped regime is not particularly obvious than that in the cuprates . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath114 has the same doping dependence as that discussed previously in the case of the cuprates @xcite , i.e. , the pseudogap state is relatively obvious at the low - doped regime , and then @xmath114 smoothly decreases upon increasing doping .",
    "this doping dependence of @xmath114 therefore leads to that the fermi - arc phenomenon in the cobaltates at the low - doped regime weakens with the increase of doping .",
    "finally , we have noted that the strong - coupling single - band model lacks for a description of the @xmath7 small pockets near the @xmath3 points .",
    "the conduction band of the cobaltates mainly consists of co @xmath115 orbitals which are split into @xmath116 singlet and @xmath7 doublet due to the presence of a trigonal crystal field @xcite . as we have mentioned in introduction section [ introduction ] , the numerical results from the first principle band calculations @xcite indicate the cobaltates to have a large efs centered at the @xmath2 point with mainly @xmath116 character and six small pockets near the @xmath3 points with the mostly @xmath7 character for a wide range of doping .",

    "it is widely believed that the essential low - energy physics of the cuprates is contained in the single - band @xmath0-@xmath1 model on a square lattice @xcite .",
    "although the single - band @xmath0-@xmath1 model on a triangular lattice can not be regarded as a complete model for the quantitative comparison with the cobaltates , the qualitative agreement between the present theoretical results and arpes experimental data also indicates that the single - band @xmath0-@xmath1 model on a triangular lattice captures the essential low - energy physics of the cobaltates @xcite .",
    "within the @xmath0-@xmath1 model on a triangular lattice , we have discussed the nature of efs in the cobaltates , and qualitatively reproduce the essential feature of the evolution of efs with doping .",
