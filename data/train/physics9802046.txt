    "in this paper we show how to get rid of some unnatural features of lagrangean mechanics , such as multivaluedness and neglecting total divergences .",
    "there is almost nothing new : we simply consider hamilton ",
    "jacobi equation and its characteristics .",
    "the only point is in introducing , instead of @xmath1 , a principal @xmath2- bundle @xmath3 over the spacetime @xmath4 , where @xmath5 or @xmath0 .",
    "even if @xmath3 is trivial , it is , in a natural way , only a bundle and not a product .",
    "this correspods to `` up to a total divergence '' phrases .",
    "the hamilton ",
    "jacobi equation is simply a @xmath2-invariant hypersurface in the space of contact elements of @xmath3 .    in quantization ,",
    "the wave functions are sections of a line bundle associated to @xmath3 , no topological ambiguity remains , so the correspondence classical @xmath6 quantum is very clear .",
    "the space of characteristics @xmath7 carries a natural contact structure ; the phase space @xmath8 emerges as the quotient of @xmath9 .",
    "thus @xmath10 is a principal @xmath0- ( or @xmath11- ) bundle ; the contact structure gives us a connection .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section 2 we present basic facts of contact geometry , its connection with symplectic geometry and geometrical quantization , with first order pde and the method of characteristics and with asymptotics of linear pde . in section 3",
    "we introduce the point of view described above and discuss its correspondence with lagrangians .",
    "for example , it may contain some additional topological information ( obviously the topological quantization ambiguity has to be hidden somewhere ) .",
    "the bundle @xmath12 and quantization are discussed in section 4 .",
    "we conclude with the fact that one can replace the group @xmath0 by any lie group almost without changing anything .",
    "finally we mention the obvious open problem  what happens if we do not consider extremal curves , but surfaces etc .",
    "a _ contact structure _ on a manifold @xmath4 is a field of hyperplanes @xmath13 ( a subbundle of codimension 1 ) satisfying a maximal nonintegrability condition .",
    "it can be formulated as follows : as for any subbundle of @xmath14 , we have a map @xmath15 satisfying ( and defined by ) the fact that for any 1-form @xmath16 on @xmath4 , annulated on @xmath17 , the formula @xmath18 holds for any @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "alternatively , we may extend @xmath21 and @xmath22 to sections of @xmath17 ; their commutator at @xmath23 ( when considered mod @xmath17 ) is @xmath24 .",
    "the maximal nonintegrability condition requires @xmath25 to be regular . in that case",
    ", @xmath4 is clearly odd - dimensional .",
    "any two contact manifolds with the same dimension are locally isomorphic ( a form of darboux theorem ) .",
    "we call a vector field on @xmath4 _ contact _ , if its flow preserves the contact strucure .",
    "there is a 1 - 1 correspodence between contact vector fields and sections of the line bundle @xmath26 .",
    "more precisely , for any @xmath27 there is a unique contact @xmath22 that becomes @xmath28 when considered mod @xmath17 .",
    "the proof is easy : choose any @xmath29 that is @xmath28 mod @xmath17 . as a rule , @xmath29 is not contact , so it generates an infinitesimal deformation of the contact structure ",
    "say @xmath30 .",
    "but due to the nondegeneracy of @xmath25 there is a unique @xmath31 producing the same deformation .",
    "thus @xmath32 is the required contact field .",
    "the field @xmath28 is called the _ contact hamiltonian _ of @xmath22 .",
    "an important example of contact geometry emerges when @xmath4 is a principal @xmath2-bundle over a symplectic manifold @xmath33 , where @xmath5 or @xmath0 .",
    "suppose we are given a connection on @xmath4 such that its curvature is @xmath34 .",
    "the horizontal distribution makes @xmath4 into a contact manifold .",
    "we can use the connection 1-form @xmath16 to identify sections of @xmath26 ( contact hamiltonians ) with functions on @xmath4 .",
    "the local flow generated by a contact field @xmath22 preserves the structure of @xmath2-bundle iff @xmath22 is @xmath2-invariant , i.e. iff its contact hamiltonian @xmath35 is ( the pullback of ) a function on @xmath36 .",
    "then the field @xmath22 is projected onto a well - defined vector field @xmath37 on @xmath36 whose flow preserves @xmath34 ; in fact , @xmath35 is a hamiltonian generating @xmath37 .",
    "we may put these facts together : the lie algebra @xmath38 ( with the poisson bracket ) is isomorphic to the lie algebra of @xmath2-invariant contact fields on @xmath4 .",
    "a function @xmath35 on @xmath36 and the corresponding hamiltonian vector field @xmath37 are combined together ( @xmath35 as the vertical part and @xmath37 as the horizontal part ) to form a contact field @xmath22 on @xmath4 .",
    "this point of view is useful in geometrical quantization .",
    "here one considers a line bundle @xmath39 associated to @xmath40 , and represents the lie algebra @xmath41 by operators on the space @xmath42 .",
    "the sections of @xmath43 are simply functions on @xmath4 equivariant with respect to @xmath2 and the action of a function @xmath44 on such a section is given by the derivative with respect to the corresponding contact vector field .",
    "the classical example of a contact manifold is the space of contact elements ( i.e. hyperplanes in the tangent space ) of a manifold @xmath4 , which we denote as @xmath45 .",
    "the distribution @xmath46 is given as follows : take an @xmath47 ; it corresponds to a hyperplane @xmath48 in @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the natural projection .",
    "then @xmath51 is @xmath52 .",
    "contact geometry , in particular on @xmath45 , was invented to give a geometrical meaning to first order partial differential equations and to lagrange method of characteristics .",
    "suppose @xmath53 is a hypersurface ; it will represent the equation .",
    "any hypersurface @xmath54 can be lifted to @xmath45 : for any point @xmath55 take the hyperplane @xmath56 to be a point of the lift @xmath57 .",
    "@xmath57 is a legendre submanifold of @xmath45 , i.e. @xmath58 and @xmath57 has the maximal possible dimension ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "@xmath60 is said to solve the equation if @xmath61 .",
    "this has a nice interpretation due to monge : for any @xmath20 we take the enveloping cone of the hyperplanes @xmath62 in @xmath63 . in this way",
    "we obtain a field of cones in @xmath4 .",
    "then @xmath60 solves the equation if it is tangent to the cones everywhere .",
    "lie s point of view is to forget about @xmath4 and to take as a solution any legendre submanifold contained in @xmath64 .",
    "such a solution may look singular in @xmath4 ( singularities emerge upon the projection @xmath50 ) .",
    "this definition uses only the contact structure on @xmath45 and thus allowes using the entire ( pseudo)group of contact transformations .",
    "now we will describe the method of characteristics .",
    "the hyperplane field @xmath46 cuts a hyperplane field @xmath65 on @xmath64 ( there may be points where the contact hyperplane touches @xmath64 .",
    "generally they are isolated and we will ignore them ) .",
    "the field @xmath65 does not make @xmath64 into a contact manifold : the form @xmath25 becomes degenerate when we restrict ourselves from @xmath51 to @xmath66 .",
    "thus at any @xmath67 there appears a direction along which @xmath25 is degenerate .",
    "the integral curves of this direction field are called _",
    "characteristics_. for example , if the monge cones coming from @xmath64 are the null cones of some pseudo - riemannian metrics on @xmath4 then the projections of the characteristics are the light - like geodesics in @xmath4 .    generally , if @xmath68 is a manifold with a hyperplane field @xmath69 , and the form @xmath70 has constant rank , then the bundle of kernels of @xmath25 , @xmath71 , is integrable . moreover , if one takes an open @xmath72 small enough , so that the integral manifolds of @xmath73 in @xmath3 form a manifold @xmath7 , then there is a well - defined contact structure on @xmath7 coming from the projection of @xmath69 .",
    "coming back to the case of @xmath53 , it gives us a method of finding the legendre submanifolds contained in @xmath64 .",
    "just take a submanifold that is almost legendre  up to the dimension , which is less by 1 .",
    "suppose that the characteristics intersect it transversally .",
    "then their union form a legendre submanifold .",
    "let us look at vector fields on @xmath64 with flow preserving the field @xmath65 ; we shall call them contact , too . first of all , there are _ characteristic vector fields _ , i.e. fields touching the characteristics .",
    "thus it is no longer true that if we choose a @xmath74 then there is a unique @xmath75 equal to @xmath28 mod @xmath65 : we can always add a characteristic field to @xmath22 .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath28 can not be arbitrary .",
    "the flow of a contact field has to preserve the characteristic foliation .",
    "if @xmath7 is the space of characteristics , each contact field on @xmath64 can be projected onto a contact field on @xmath7 ( recall @xmath7 is a contact manifold ) .",
    "this is the basis for conservation laws .",
    "for example if a contact field @xmath76 ( i.e. @xmath77 ) at a point @xmath67 then @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) along the characteristic @xmath78 running through @xmath23 .",
    "let us also notice that any contact vector field on @xmath64 can be prolongated to a contact vector field on @xmath45 ( with the flow preserving @xmath64 ) .",
    "hypersurfaces @xmath53 often come from an equation of the type @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is a linear differential operator .",
    "take the sybmol @xmath81 of @xmath82 ( a function on @xmath83 defined by @xmath84 , @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the degree of @xmath82 and @xmath87 ) .",
    "the equation @xmath88 specifies a hypersurface @xmath53 .",
    "the singularities of solutions of @xmath79 are located on hypersurfaces solving the equation corresponding to @xmath64 ; also , if @xmath89 , @xmath85 is an asymptotic solution of @xmath79 then the levels @xmath90 solve the @xmath64-equation .",
    "we shall deal with first - order variational principles .",
    "suppose that at each point @xmath23 of a manifold @xmath4 ( the space - time or extended configuration space ) there is a 1-homogeneous function @xmath91 ( and suppose everything is smooth outside the zero section of @xmath14 ) .",
    "then on each oriented curve @xmath92 , @xmath93 specifies a 1-form , so we may compute its integral @xmath94 .",
    "we are looking for extremals of @xmath95 ( in this paper , extremal means stationary ) .",
    "there are several reasons why this point of view is not entirely satisfactory .",
    "first of all , even in the simplest problems , @xmath96 is not defined on all @xmath63 , but only on an open conic subset .",
    "even worse , @xmath93 may be multivalued .",
    "an example is drawn on the following two figures .",
    "on the first one , we suppose that @xmath96 is positive ( outside 0 ) .",
    "the figure represents the endpoints of vectors satisfying @xmath97 ; it is called the _ wave diagram _ in the beautiful elementary book @xcite .",
    "the dashed lines represent a covector @xmath98 corresponding to the drawn vector ( they are @xmath99 and @xmath100 ) ; @xmath98 is called the _",
    "momentum_.    @xmath101 obviously , we may use the field of wave diagrams instead of @xmath93 .",
    "but we may work as well with diagrams of the following shape ; they correspond to multivalued @xmath93 s :    @xmath102    however , the real problem is that @xmath93 is unnatural .",
    "the reason is that it is defined only up to a closed 1-form .",
    "for example , in the presence of an ` electromagnetic field ' @xmath103 , @xmath104 , we take as the actual @xmath93 ( the one from which we compute @xmath95 ) @xmath105 , where @xmath106 . of course @xmath107 need not exist globally and it is not defined uniquely .",
    "this problem appears also in noether theorem : we take as an infinitesimal symmetry any vector field @xmath22 whose flow preserves @xmath93 up to some @xmath108 .",
    "it is desirable to have a picture in which @xmath22 is an actual symmetry .",
    "a way out is in the following construction : let @xmath109 be a principal @xmath2-bundle , where @xmath110 or @xmath11 ( you may imagine that we added the action @xmath95 to @xmath4 as a new coordinate ; of course this interpretation is rather limited ) .",
    "suppose we are given a @xmath2-invariant hypersurface @xmath111 ; we are interested in its characteristics",
    ". their projections to @xmath4 are the extremals for certain ( multivalued ) @xmath93 ( if @xmath112 then either @xmath93 exists only locally or we must admit an elmg . field @xmath68 ) .",
    "we simply replaced @xmath93 by the corresponding hamilton ",
    "jacobi equation @xmath64 , but the new point of view is rid of the problems listed above . _ for this reason we take @xmath111 and its characteristics as fundamental and the lagrangian @xmath93 as a derived , sometimes ill - defined notion . _",
    "the correspondence between @xmath64 and @xmath93 is as follows : let @xmath16 be an arbitrary connection 1-form on @xmath3 . to find the wave diagram at a point @xmath20 ,",
    "take a point @xmath113 above @xmath23 .",
    "the intersection of the monge cone in @xmath114 with the hyperplane @xmath115 is the wave diagram .",
    "we have to take the curvature @xmath68 as the elmg .",
    "we see that the transformation @xmath116 , @xmath117 ( @xmath107 a 1-form ) corresponds simply to a change of the connection .",
    "if we start with @xmath93 and @xmath68 , we have to suppose that the periods of @xmath68 are integral ( or at least commesurable ) to find a @xmath3 admitting a connection with @xmath68 as the curvature",
    ". notice that if @xmath118 , the picture @xmath111 contains more information than the pair @xmath119 .",
    "the inequivalent choices of @xmath3 together with a connection correspond to the elements of the group @xmath120 ( this group acts there freely and transitively ) .",
    "the subgroup @xmath121 corresponds to equivalent @xmath3 s ( with ineqivalent connections ) ; if @xmath110 , even the quotient group may be nontrivial ( it is @xmath122 ) ) . these ambiguities are clearly connected with quantization .    a well known example is the following : let the monge cones on @xmath3 be the light cones of a lorentzian metrics and suppose the vector field @xmath123 generating the action of @xmath2 is spacelike . as a connection on @xmath3 take the orthogonal complements of @xmath123 .",
    "then the wave diagrams are the ( pseudo)spheres of a lorentzian metrics on @xmath4 .",
    "this picture describes a charged relativistic particle and its antiparticle in an elmg .",
    "field given by the curvature of the connection . into two halfs .",
    "thus the lightlike geodesics in @xmath3 ( the characteristics ) are ( at least locally , and globally if there is a time orientation ) divided into 3 classes ; two of them are projected onto particles and antiparticles worldlines respectively , while the curves in the third class are horizontal and they are projected onto lightlike geodesics in @xmath4 . ] in the nonrelativistic limit the field @xmath123 becomes lightlike and the antiparticle disappears .",
    "let us look at noether theorem . in the @xmath119-picture one takes as a symmetry a vector field @xmath22 together with a function @xmath35 satisfying @xmath124 ( @xmath125 denotes the lie derivative )",
    "; then @xmath126 is constant on extremals .",
    "but for @xmath111 we simply take a @xmath2-invariant vector field on @xmath3 preserving @xmath64 .",
    "in fact one easily sees the full statement of noether theorem , claiming a 1 - 1 correspondence between conservation laws and @xmath2-invariant contact fields on @xmath64 modulo characteristic fields .",
    "let us suppose that the characteristics in @xmath64 form a manifold @xmath7 .",
    "it inherits a contact structure .",
    "notice that @xmath64 is a @xmath2-bundle ; we shall also suppose that the group @xmath2 acts nicely on @xmath7 so that @xmath7 becomes a @xmath127-bundle where @xmath128 and @xmath129 is discrete .",
    "its base @xmath130 is the phase space . where the contact hyperplanes on @xmath7 may be used as a connection for @xmath10 , the curvature is the usual symplectic form on @xmath8 .",
    "the points of @xmath8 where this is impossible are usually deleted and they should be regarded as ideal . for example , the full @xmath8 of a relativistic particle in 1 + 1-dimensions is on the following picture :    @xmath131 one half of the cylinder corresponds to particles , the other half to antiparticles and the connecting lines to lightlike geodesics .",
    "we see that there is a completely natural @xmath0- or @xmath11-bundle @xmath7 over the phase space , together with a natural connection .",
    "it is important in the view of use of such a bundle in quantization .",
    "notice that @xmath7 is even prior to @xmath8 .",
    "let us now look at quantization using wave functions in @xmath4 .",
    "this may have nothing to do with quantum mechanics : we simply look for a wave equation that leads to a given classical picture in a limit .",
    "usually , one considers linear equations @xmath132 ( @xmath133 being a parameter in @xmath82 ) and looks for the high - frequency asymptotics as @xmath134 and the wavelength is of order @xmath133 .",
    "it is however much nicer if @xmath82 is fixed ; an outline of the theory was given at the end of section 2 .",
    "thus let @xmath82 be a @xmath2-invariant linear diff .",
    "operator on @xmath3 .",
    "if we consider only @xmath2-equivariant functions ( with the weight @xmath135 ) , we get an operator @xmath136 on the corresponding associated bundle .    for example",
    ", the schroedinger equation comes from @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the new coordinate ( here @xmath139 ) : just notice that @xmath140 becomes @xmath141 for @xmath142 with the weight @xmath143 .",
    "let @xmath111 be given by @xmath88 where @xmath81 is the symbol of @xmath82 ( notice that the monge cone in @xmath144 is dual to the cone @xmath145 in @xmath146 ) .",
    "in the obvious sense the equation @xmath147 gives the classical @xmath64-theory as @xmath148 .",
    "for example , take a ( nonequivariant ! ) solution of @xmath79 with a singularity on a narrow strip along a characteristic of @xmath64 .",
    "if we take the fourier component @xmath149 for @xmath134 , it is significantly non - zero only close to the projection of the characteristic to @xmath4 . perhaps an interesting point is that the equation @xmath79 contains @xmath147 for any @xmath133 .    thus given @xmath64 , quantization simply means a @xmath2-invariant @xmath82 giving @xmath64 by @xmath88 .",
    "of course , the monge cones of @xmath64 have to be algebraic .",
    "finally , let us return to @xmath10 .",
    "we have a situation typical to integral geometry : @xmath150 .",
    "in geometrical quantization one considers sections of bundles associated to @xmath10 , but here we take all possible @xmath133 s at once , so we consider all the functions on @xmath7 instead .",
    "one should expect a correspondence between certain such fuctions and functions on @xmath3 satisfying @xmath79 .",
    "a polarization on @xmath8 gives us a @xmath2-invariant legendrean foliation ( if it is real ) or ( if it is completely complex ) a @xmath2-invariant ( codimension 1 and nondegenerate ) @xmath151-structure on @xmath7 . the foliation gives us a complete system of solution of the jacobi  hamilton equation .",
    "thus functions on @xmath7 , constant on the leaves of the foliations , should correspond to solutions of @xmath79 that are ( integral ) linear combinations of functions singular along hypersurfaces in the complete system .",
    "the @xmath151-case is somewhat more complicated .",
    "the discussion above is useless in this complete generality ( and several important points were omitted ) , but it might be interesting for some classes of @xmath82 s .",
    "in the present paper @xmath2 was always 1-dimensional , but one can consider a principal @xmath2 bundle @xmath109 and a hypersurface @xmath111 for another lie group @xmath2 .",
    "the manifold @xmath7 is still contact , but @xmath152 is no longer symplectic ; it carries only an analogue of symplectic structure .",
    "characterictics of @xmath64 represent particles in a yang  mills field .",
    "we can also consider a @xmath2-invariant operator @xmath153 .",
    "suppose @xmath154 is a @xmath2-module and the dual @xmath155 contains a cyclic vector @xmath16 .",
    "let @xmath156 be the ideal in @xmath157 of elements annulating @xmath16",
    ". then we can embed @xmath154 into the regular representation ( namely onto functions annulated by @xmath156 ) via @xmath158 . in this way the functions on @xmath3 annulated by @xmath156 are sections of the vector bundle associated to @xmath154 .",
    "thus @xmath82 becomes an operator on these sections .",
    "we see the situation is quite analogous to 1-dimensional @xmath2",
