    "much of the beauty of physics derives from the fact that it is often possible to understand a broad range of quite complex phenomena in terms of a small class of simple and sometimes surprisingly universal physical problems .",
    "the harmonic oscillator , with its ubiquitous appearance everywhere from physics of diatomic molecules to the simple pendulum to the theory of cosmological perturbations , is perhaps the first example that comes to mind . as we will argue in this article ,",

    ", the shape of ahanging chain \" is a centuries old problem that has occupied some of the greatest mathematical minds of all time including no less than galileo ( who got it wrong ) , huygens ( who showed why ) , leibnitz ( who got it right ) , the bernoulli brothers ( who also got it right ) , euler and lagrange ( who showed how the , then , newly developed machinery of the calculus of variations could be brought to bear on the problem with astounding efficiency ) . today , not only does almost every ( physics ) undergraduate know that a uniform ideal chain hanging under its own weight from two fixed points at a fixed height assumes the shape of a _ catenary _ , but the determination of the shape function of the chain has become a routine exercise in variational calculus  @xcite .",
    "so much so that one might be forgiven for thinking that the problem had nothing more of value to offer .",
    "one would , of course , be mistaken .",
    "indeed , several variations on the catenary problem exist .",
    "these include the elastic , centrally loaded chains  @xcite and a number of studies of chains with varying mass density @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "the common theme to all of these problems though , is that they are concerned with the shape assumed by a _",
    "static _ chain in a gravitational field .",
    "the case of a chain with _ time - dependent _ boundary conditions appears to have remained largely unstudied , as far as we are aware .",
    "+ our own interest in this problem arose in a largely tangential way through the study of certain instabilities of d - branes in superstring theory  @xcite .",
    "d - branes are wonderfully multi - faceted membrane - like solutions in string theory that , for the purposes of this article , can be understood simply as somewhere that open strings must end . in other words , they define the boundary conditions for open strings . as such , the endpoints of the attached open string satisfy neumann boundary conditions in the direction of the membrane and dirichlet conditions in the orthogonal directions . but d - branes are so much more than that ; they are actually charged objects in the spectrum of the theory .",
    "they couple to ramond - ramond ( rr ) fluxes in the same way that electrons - charged particles in electromagnetism - couple to the electromagnetic field . and , in fact ,",
    "just like electrons in an electromagnetic field , d - branes moving in an rr background will experience the analogue of a lorentz force and accelerate .",
    "this is true in particular for a d - brane falling in a gravitational potential ( near a black hole , for example ) which will be accelerated off geodesic paths due to this lorentz - like acceleration .",
    "open strings attached to such d - branes , however , feel no such force since they are not rr - charged and so should be in geodesic freefall . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was argued that the effect of this difference in the way that strings and membranes behave is two - fold : the string grows and its endpoints start to come together .",
    "if the string is allowed to self interact then the open string ends coming together forms a closed string which , no longer bound to the membrane by dirichlet boundary conditions , is free to leave , carrying away energy from the d - brane .",
    "the authors of @xcite discovered this instability through a sophisticated study of a class of operators that represent the membrane - string configuration in a _ dual _ quantum field theory ( a supersymmetric yang - mills gauge theory ) and , in passing , suggested that a good toy model with which to build intuition about this problem might be classical strings in rindler space or , through the equivalence principle , classical strings in a gravitational field .",
    "some of this intuition was validated in @xcite , where it was demonstrated that the profile function of a ( fundamental , relativistic ) string suspended between two points in rindler space ( a fixed distance away from the rindler horizon ) is indeed of the catenary form . to fully appreciate the mechanism of the d - brane instability however , we need to understand the dynamics of open strings whose endpoints are free to move along the membrane . toward this end , and to push the analogy with the hanging chain as far as we can , we study the simple mechanical problem of an inextensible chain attached to a rod which is itself fixed at some height , h , in a gravitational field , g. the key feature to our problem is that the points of attachment are free to move along the rod ( as they would be if the chain were attached by , say , frictionless rings ) .",
    "we would like to know    * what is the shape of the string at any time , @xmath1 ?",
    "* intuitively , it seems clear to us that as the string falls in the gravitational field , the ends come together .",
    "how then does the time that it takes depend on the various parameters ?",
    "* does the motion of the string generate wave modes along the string , and if so , what is it s frequency spectrum ?    to the best of our knowledge ( and much to our surprise ) these questions have not yet been answered for this system in the literature . in what follows ,",

    "we begin with a quick recall of the static hanging string problem .",
    "this system has , obviously , been well studied in the literature ( see , for example @xcite for excellent discussions of the catenary as well as some of its variants ) and we include it here only to establish our notations , discuss various parameterizations and benchmark our numerical integration scheme .",

    "the problem of a static string suspended in a gravitational field is an old one whose solution - the catenary - is well know to most freshman students of physics . in this article",
    ", we revisit this system with the intent to allow the ( attached ) ends of the string to move freely along the direction of suspension ( _ i.e. _ along a fixed height ) .",
    "we have argued that this simple mechanical system actually gives a remarkably good description of the dynamics of a long open string attached to an accelerated d - brane in string theory .",
    "this latter problem has an equivalent formulation as a string attached to a d - brane embedded in a rindler spacetime at a fixed distance from the rindler horizon .    in the newtonian case , which forms the bulk of this article ,",
    "we have obtained the typical collision time for the endpoints of the string as a function of the relevant parameters and showed that it is typically of the order of @xmath235 .",
    "this estimate , as well as a solution for the ( rescaled ) position of the string endpoint , were obtained through the assumption that the evolution of the string is adiabatic and checked by a direct numerical integration of the equations of motion .",
    "the numerical integration also showed that , in the absence of interactions between the string endpoints , the natural evolution of the catenary profile degenerates into cusps after one or two crossings .",
    "the analysis was then extended to a relativistic string of constant tension , _",
    "i.e. _ of the goto - nambu type .",
    "here we were able to gain some physical intuition why the static configuration of such a string attached to a d - brane located in a rindler spacetime , _",
    "i.e. _ subject to a constant acceleration , was similar to the constant length newtonian catenary as found in @xcite .",
    "we also found that , while the dynamical relativistic case differs quite substantially from the newtonian string , at least at the level of the equations of motion and their solutions , predictions for the collision - time for the string ends are remarkably similar , as long as the d - brane is not too close to the rindler horizon .",
    "indeed , this is one of the main results of this analysis .",
    "in fact , this simple classical analogue gives us a number of important clues about the physics of radiating branes .",
    "for example , when string interactions are turned on , there are two ways that the long open string attached to the d - brane can form a closed string and leave the brane : either the endpoints of the string meet or the string self - intersects at some point in its evolution forming in the process a closed string loop and a shorter open string . from our analysis",
    "we see that the string does indeed self - intersect , forming several cusps along its length but that this only occurs _",
    "after _ the endpoints coalesce . in its broadest sense ,",
    "our results offer a way to construct a toy model of the dynamics of the process of gravitational radiation from accelerated branes .",
    "we describe this process in more detail in a companion article  @xcite .",
