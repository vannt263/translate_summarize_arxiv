    "one of the main goals of modern nuclear physics is to study the behavior of nuclear matter under extreme conditions . at low temperatures and densities the quarks and gluons as the basic constituents of strongly interacting matter form hadrons due to the confinement mechanism .",
    "in addition , the appearance of rather light mesons ( pions and kaons ) signals the existence of a spontaneously broken symmetry , the chiral symmetry .",
    "in fact this symmetry is approximately realized in the qcd lagrangian .",
    "another important hint that chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken in the vacuum state is the absence of chiral partners with equal masses . in a chirally symmetric state",
    "chiral partners would have the same mass .",
    "this concerns for example the isovector vector meson @xmath0 and its much heavier partner , the isovector axial - vector meson @xmath1 .",
    "it is expected that at high enough temperatures and densities confinement is lifted and chiral symmetry restored .",
    "high energy heavy - ion collisions are dedicated to the creation of this new state of matter , the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , even if such an ultra - hot system of quarks and gluons is created only its decay products  which of course are hadrons and not deconfined quarks and gluons  can reach the detectors .",
    "thus , the proof for the existence of this new stage of matter has to be performed rather indirectly . besides the observable hadrons also photons and dileptons are radiated from the hot fireball .",
    "these particles deserve special attention since they do not suffer from strong final state interactions .",
    "therefore , once created in the high density region they are capable to carry information from that region to the detectors .",
    "altogether , the challenge is to find unambiguous signs that ( part of ) the observed spectra of hadrons , photons , and dileptons are caused by the transient existence of the qgp . clearly , to prove the existence of the qgp it is necessary to show that the spectra can not be explained by a hot fireball made out of conventional interacting hadrons .",
    "this task is especially complicated by the fact that there is no straightforward derivation of hadronic lagrangians from qcd as the underlying theory of strong interactions .",
    "therefore it is not a priori clear how far one can trust in - medium calculations with hadronic lagrangians as their parameters are adjusted to the description of vacuum processes .",
    "connections between hadronic models and concepts on the one hand side and qcd or qcd based models on the other hand side are therefore very welcome .",
    "the qcd sum rule method @xcite provides such a link .",
    "before we sketch its basic concepts , however , we want to dwell for a moment on the in - medium properties of hadrons .    for temperatures and densities below but near to the critical values which mark the transition to the qgp it is plausible to expect that already there the properties of the involved hadrons like e.g.  their masses and decay widths get modified .",
    "especially the aspect of chiral symmetry restoration is interesting here .",
    "the properties of chiral partners should start to approach each other and finally become identical in the chirally symmetric phase . concerning @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons possible scenarios",
    "are e.g.  discussed in @xcite for the case of finite temperature . in principle",
    "one can distinguish three types of possible phenomena ( which do not exclude each other ) :    * mass shifts : the masses of @xmath0 and @xmath1 might approach each other .",
    "one has to distinguish in which way this actually happens : the masses might meet at a value somewhere in between their vacuum masses ( and possibly drop together afterwards ) .",
    "it is however also possible that the masses of both mesons drop and finally ( approximately ) vanish at the point of chiral symmetry restoration . *",
    "peak broadening : from the experimental point of view the @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) meson shows up as a peak in the vector ( axial - vector ) channel . in a medium the peaks might get broader ( maybe without a change of the respective peak positions , i.e.  the nominal masses ) until the melted spectra in both channels become degenerate . *",
    "mixing : the distinct peaks might maintain ( maybe without shifts or broadening ) , but the @xmath1 peak shows up with increasing height in the vector channel and vice versa .    in any case , the spectra in the vector and axial - vector channel become degenerate when chiral symmetry becomes restored .    in fact",
    ", the @xmath0 meson is supposed to be a good candidate to search for a sign of chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "the reason is that it has the quantum numbers of the photon .",
    "therefore the @xmath0 meson can decay via a virtual photon into a dilepton pair .",
    "if this decay happens within a hot and dense medium the dileptons contain information about the in - medium properties of the @xmath0 meson .",
    "therefore , in principle the possible scenarios discussed above or a mixture of them should leave their marks in the dilepton spectra .",
    "indeed , the helios and ceres collaborations have reported medium modifications in the dilepton spectra in the invariant mass range around the @xmath0 meson mass @xcite . whether the observed spectra can be explained within a conventional hadronic scenario @xcite or whether one has to include medium modifications induced by chiral symmetry restoration @xcite is still a matter of discussion ( cf .",
    "also @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "also for the study of possible in - medium changes of hadronic properties a closer connection between hadrons and qcd is desirable .",
    "the qcd sum rule approach has the merit to relate certain low energy quantities  which so far are not directly accessible by qcd  with high energy expressions which can be calculated by the operator product expansion @xcite in terms of quark and gluon degrees of freedom .",
    "non - perturbative effects are encoded in the appearance of various quark and gluon condensates . in the following this method",
    "is applied to vector and axial - vector mesons placed in a cold medium with finite nuclear density . to clearly work out the modifications",
    "when changing from vacuum to a medium we also discuss the vacuum sum rule analysis for @xmath0 and @xmath1 in some detail . before sketching the basic ideas of the sum rule approach we review the present status of in - medium analyses for vector and axial - vector mesons especially in the light of the possible scenarios of in - medium changes discussed above : concerning finite temperature @xmath2",
    "it has been shown @xcite that at @xmath3 and neglecting the pion mass only mixing occurs . a systematic study beyond this linear ( pion ) density approximation is complicated by unknown non - scalar higher twist condensates @xcite . for finite nucleon density previous analyses",
    "have restricted their attention to the vector channel . in the first analyses",
    "@xcite only a possible mass shift for the @xmath0 meson has been taken into account , i.e.  the possible scenarios of peak broadening and/or mixing as mentioned above have been excluded by hand . in this case it was found that the @xmath0 meson mass would drop in a nuclear medium .",
    "however , it has been shown by the authors of @xcite that their specific hadronic model also fulfills the sum rule ( cf .",
    "also @xcite ) .",
    "this model predicts peak broadening for the @xmath0 meson and basically no mass shift .",
    "subsequently , a systematic study revealed that independently of the chosen hadronic model the sum rule for the @xmath0 meson for finite density is in accordance with a specific mass - width correlation @xcite : for low width the mass has to decrease . if , however , the mass stays constant  or even rises",
    " the width has to increase .",
    "the sum rule does not have enough predictive power to fix both the mass and the width of the vector meson .",
    "we will come back to that point below . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", the third possible in - medium modification , the mixing phenomena , has not yet been included in a systematic sum rule analysis for the vector axial - vector system for finite density .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to treat the properties of @xmath0 and @xmath1 on equal footing , allowing for mass - shifts , peak broadening , and mixing .",
    "before we turn to the specific sum rule analysis for the chiral partners @xmath0 and @xmath1 we discuss some important aspects of the qcd sum rule approach focusing especially on in - medium situations . recall that our basic motivation was to describe various spectra of heavy - ion collisions by hadronic models in absence of a qcd description based on first principles . even when only hadronic models are capable to calculate _",
    "observable _ quantities",
    "one can imagine that it is possible to find other quantities which can be reliably determined both within the hadronic framework and in terms of quark and gluon degrees of freedom .",
    "in this way one obtains predictions for hadronic parameters like masses and coupling constants or cross - check for hadronic models . concerning the qcd sum rule method such quantities are specific correlators ( see below ) calculated in the deep space - like region , i.e.  for large momenta @xmath4 with @xmath5 . for very large @xmath6 qcd perturbation theory",
    "becomes applicable .",
    "proceeding to ( somewhat ) smaller values of @xmath7 non - perturbative corrections appear .",
    "they can be expanded in a power series in @xmath8 , called the operator product expansion ( ope ) : @xmath9 in the coefficients @xmath10 the famous quark and gluon condensates enter .",
    "one can imagine the series ( [ eq : powermoge ] ) as a separation of the hard ( denominator ) and soft ( numerator ) scales of the problem ( cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) . in the numerator",
    "the non - perturbative effects enter . in practice , only the first few coefficients in ( [ eq : powermoge ] ) can be determined .",
    "of course , this does not matter as long as @xmath7 is large enough .",
    "thus , the crucial question is for which values of @xmath7 one can trust the truncated series . if we want to learn something about a hadron with mass @xmath11 it turns out that @xmath7 has to be of the order of @xmath12 . to get an order of magnitude estimate for the coefficients @xmath10 we have to ask about the typical scales for non - perturbative effects .",
    "let us discuss step by step the different cases of vacuum , finite temperature and finite baryon density .",
    "for vacuum the typical scales are @xmath13 and the current quark masses .",
    "the up and down quark masses have only a few mev and are therefore negligibly small .",
    "the strange quark mass and @xmath13 are between 100 and @xmath14mev . on the other hand ,",
    "the typical hadron masses are of the order of @xmath15gev .",
    "therefore , one might expect that the sum rule analysis leads to reasonable results .",
    "of course , the masses of the much lighter pions and kaons can not be determined .",
    "unfortunately this optimistic picture is not completely true .",
    "in fact , there might be non - perturbative effects which introduce an additional hard scale , like e.g.  instantons @xcite . in this case",
    "the series ( [ eq : powermoge ] ) would break down for the interesting values of @xmath7 .",
    "it seems , however , that the influence of such effects on the @xmath0 and @xmath1 sum rules is not important .",
    "we therefore _ assume _ throughout this work that the ope works for the vector and axial - vector channel .",
    "nonetheless , this consideration shows that at present the qcd sum rule approach can not be directly justified from qcd without any additional assumptions .",
    "therefore it should merely be regarded as a qcd based model and not as qcd itself .",
    "turning to the case of finite temperature involves new scales .",
    "it is common practice to approximate the low temperature medium by a pion gas .",
    "therefore the new scales are the temperature and the pion mass .",
    "also these quantities are of the order of @xmath13 . of course",
    ", @xmath2 might also be lower .",
    "therefore the previous considerations apply also here .",
    "the case of finite baryon density @xmath16 is more complicated .",
    "here one approximates the medium by a fermi gas of nucleons .",
    "new in - medium scales are the fermi momentum and the nucleon mass .",
    "while the former is reasonably small e.g.  for saturation density of nuclear matter , the latter is of the order of @xmath15gev . since the nucleon mass enters the series ( [ eq : powermoge ] ) in the numerator it becomes questionable whether the ope still works ( cf .",
    "also the discussion in @xcite and the successive comments @xcite ) .",
    "full clarification of this question requires the determination of all coefficients @xmath10 which would be equivalent to solving qcd in the non - perturbative low energy domain .",
    "this is of course out of reach . for our case at hand",
    "there is , however , a class of contributions to the ope which can be determined to all orders , namely the twist - two condensates @xcite .",
    "in fact their contribution to the coefficients in the low density approximation is given by @xmath17 i.e.  powers of @xmath7 in the denominator which in an optimal situation should suppress higher order contributions in ( [ eq : powermoge ] ) are compensated by powers of @xmath18 in the numerator .",
    "thus the class of twist - two contributions shows exactly the unpleasant feature discussed above . in ( [ eq : tw2concoeff ] ) the dimensionless quantities @xmath19 can be determined from the parton distributions in a nucleon @xcite .",
    "fortunately it turns out that @xmath19 is strongly decreasing with increasing @xmath20 such that the higher dimensional contributions of the twist - two condensates can safely be neglected @xcite .",
    "this is a hint that the ope still works in the case of finite nuclear density .",
    "of course this is not a proof for the validity of the ope . throughout this work",
    "we _ assume _ that the ope works .",
    "in spite of these obvious problems inherent to the qcd sum rule approach for finite density we regard the analysis presented in the following as useful in view of the possibility to learn something about the in - medium properties of hadrons from an approach which deals with the fundamental degrees of freedom of qcd . nonetheless we stress again that the qcd sum rule approach  especially for the case of finite nuclear density  is not as fundamental as qcd .",
    "the article is organized in the following way : in the next section we derive the in - medium borel sum rules for @xmath0 and @xmath1 which we will use throughout this work for any quantitative statements . in sec .",
    "[ sec : fesr ] we make a detour to discuss a different type of sum rule , namely the finite energy sum rule .",
    "this will yield a qualitative picture what one has to expect from a sum rule analysis and how much information one can get . in sec .",
    "[ sec : brwi ] we introduce our hadronic parametrizations which are used to analyze the sum rules .",
    "results for @xmath0 and @xmath1 in vacuum are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : resvac ] .",
    "these results serve as a reference frame with which we can compare the succeeding in - medium results .",
    "[ sec : inmed ] is devoted to the discussion of the mixing phenomena while the in - medium results are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : resmed ] .",
    "finally we summarize and discuss our results in sec .",
    "[ sec : sum ] .",
    "the relevant quantity to look at is the covariant time ordered current - current correlator @xmath21 for the @xmath0 meson channel @xmath22 is the isospin-1 part of the electromagnetic current , @xmath23 this current - current correlator enters e.g.  the cross section of @xmath24 hadrons ( see below ) . for the @xmath1 meson channel we have to deal with the corresponding axial - vector current @xmath25    the expectation value in ( [ eq : curcur ] ) is taken with respect to the surrounding environment .",
    "we study here , first , vacuum and , second , an ( isospin neutral ) equilibrated homogeneous medium with finite nuclear density and vanishing temperature . in the medium lorentz invariance",
    "is broken .",
    "all the formulae which we will present in the following refer to the lorentz frame where the medium is at rest , i.e.  where the spatial components of the baryonic current vanish .",
    "for simplicity we restrict our considerations to mesons which are at rest with respect to the medium . for the vacuum case we can choose the rest system of the ( axial- ) vector meson without any loss of generality .    in the following the formulae without an explicit @xmath26 or @xmath27 index are valid for both vector and axial - vector channel .",
    "the correlator ( [ eq : curcur ] ) has the following decomposition ( valid for mesons at rest ! ) @xmath28 in the following we concentrate on @xmath29 . in the vector channel",
    "one has @xmath30 since the current @xmath31 is conserved .",
    "we prefer the use of @xmath32 instead of @xmath33 since it has been shown in @xcite that the borel sum rule ( see below ) is rather unstable for the latter quantity .",
    "the divergence of the axial - vector channel is solely determined by the pion decay .",
    "hence we would not learn anything new about the @xmath1 by studying @xmath33 in addition to @xmath32 .",
    "concerning e.g.  the dilepton production one is interested in the values of the dimensionless quantity @xmath34 in the time - like region @xmath35 .",
    "the reason is that @xmath36 is related to the cross section @xmath24 hadrons with isospin 1 via @xcite @xmath37 at least for low energies the time - like region is determined by hadronic degrees of freedom . in principle , there are two possibilities to describe the current - current correlator . first , guided by an educated guess one might use a simple parametrization with some free parameters .",
    "second , one might use a hadronic model , e.g.  for vector mesons @xcite using one or the other form of vector meson dominance . in the following",
    "we will explore the first possibility and figure out which constraints for these free parameters are provided by the qcd sum rule approach .",
    "for the @xmath1 we proceed completely analogously .",
    "we denote the result for @xmath32 in the time - like region by @xmath38 . on the other hand",
    ", the current - current correlator ( [ eq : curcur ] ) can be calculated for @xmath5 using wilson s operator product expansion ( ope ) @xcite for quark and gluonic degrees of freedom @xcite ( for in - medium calculations see e.g.  @xcite ) . in the following",
    "we shall call the result of that calculation @xmath39 . a second representation in the space - like region which has to match @xmath39",
    "can be obtained from @xmath38 by utilizing a subtracted dispersion relation .",

    "( [ eq : opehadr ] ) connects hadronic with quark - gluon based expressions . in principle , for a given hadronic parametrization of @xmath38 with free parameters this equation could be used to extract information about these parameters .",
    "this , however , would require the knowledge of @xmath43 for arbitrary large @xmath44 .",
    "in practice , the situation is such that one has a parametrization for the current - current correlator for the energy region of the lowest hadronic resonance , but one usually has no model which remains valid for arbitrary high energies . in the dispersion integral of ( [ eq : opehadr ] ) higher lying resonances",
    "are suppressed , but only by a factor @xmath45 .",
    "clearly , it is desirable to achieve a larger suppression of the part of the hadronic spectral distribution on which one has less access . to this aim , a borel transformation @xcite can be applied to ( [ eq : opehadr ] ) . for an arbitrary function",
    "@xmath46 the borel transformation is defined as @xmath47 with @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the so - called borel mass . applying the borel transformation to ( [ eq : opehadr ] )",
    "we finally get @xcite @xmath50 we observe that higher resonance states are now exponentially suppressed . note that the subtraction constant @xmath51 of ( [ eq : opehadr ] ) has dropped out .",
    "the other one , @xmath52 , vanishes in vacuum . in a nuclear medium for a meson at rest",
    ", we incorporate the landau damping term in the subtraction constant @xmath52 .",
    "this term comes from the absorption of a space - like meson by an on - shell nucleon . having incorporated this term in @xmath52 we avoid double counting by restricting the integration in ( [ eq : sumrule ] ) to the time - like region . for a detailed discussion of that point cf .",
    "one gets in the linear density approximation @xmath53 eq .  ( [ eq : sumrule ] ) is the qcd sum rule which we will utilize in the following .",
    "having achieved a reasonable suppression of the energy region above the lowest lying resonance the integral in ( [ eq : sumrule ] ) is no longer sensitive to the details of the hadronic spectral distribution in that region .",
    "for high energies the quark structure of the current - current correlator is resolved .",
    "qcd perturbation theory becomes applicable yielding @xmath54 these considerations suggest the ansatz @xmath55 where @xmath56 denotes the threshold between the low energy region described by a spectral function for the lowest lying resonance , @xmath57 , and the high energy region described by a continuum calculated from perturbative qcd . in the following we use @xmath58",
    "of course , the high energy behavior given in ( [ eq : pihadans ] ) is only an approximation on the true spectral distribution for the current - current correlator .",
    "also the rapid cross - over in ( [ eq : pihadans ] ) from the resonance to the continuum region is not realistic .",
    "however , exactly here the suppression factors discussed above should become effective making a more detailed description of the cross - over and the high energy region insignificant .",
    "the price we have to pay for the simple decomposition ( [ eq : pihadans ] ) is the appearance of a new parameter @xmath56 , the continuum threshold , which in general depends on the nuclear density .",
    "we will elaborate below on the determination of @xmath56 .    to study the content of ( [ eq : sumrule ] ) for the vector and axial - vector channel we need the ope for the l.h.s . in general",

    "the vacuum case @xcite is easily obtained by @xmath61 . for the vector channel one gets @xcite ( for details see also @xcite and references therein )    [ eq : coeffrho ] @xmath62    while for the axial - vector sector one obtains @xcite    [ eq : coeffa1 ] @xmath63    we neglect ( unknown ) condensates with dimension higher than 6 and some less important twist-4 condensates and @xmath64 corrections ( cf .",
    "we also neglect perturbative contributions proportional to the square of the current quark masses .",

    "we work here in the linear density approximation : @xmath65 a single nucleon state is denoted by @xmath66 .",

    "sec : inmed ] and only discuss their vacuum expectation values here . for the gluon condensate",
    "we use a canonical value of @xcite @xmath68 . as compared to the gluon - condensate the influence of the two - quark condensate @xcite @xmath69 is rather small ( and is further diminished in a nuclear environment ) . here",

    "@xmath73 and @xmath74 is very limited .",
    "traditionally factorization is assumed which , however , probably underestimates its value . in the following",
    "we will use two values for the four - quark condensates to explore the sensitivity of the results : @xmath75 the larger value is chosen as to obtain an optimal agreement between qcd sum rule prediction and experiment for the @xmath0 meson properties in vacuum .",
    "finally the terms proportional to @xmath76 and @xmath77 in ( [ eq : coeffrho],[eq : coeffa1 ] ) stem from twist-2 condensates .",
    "they are obtained from the moments of the quark distributions in a nucleon @xcite .",
    "we use @xmath78 , @xmath79 .",
    "so far we have not specified for which values of @xmath80 we regard the sum rule ( [ eq : sumrule ] ) to be valid . note that in practice ( [ eq : opegen ] ) is a truncated series in @xmath59 .",
    "clearly , if @xmath80 is too small the @xmath59 expansion in ( [ eq : opegen ] ) breaks down .",
    "on the other hand , however , if @xmath80 is too large the exponential in ( [ eq : sumrule ] ) does not sufficiently suppress the intermediate and high energy part of @xmath81 given in ( [ eq : pihadans ] ) .",
    "as mentioned above this suppression is important since the modeling of the region around the threshold @xmath56 is rather crude .",
    "if these qualitative considerations are put on a more quantitative level one can define a so called borel window for the masses @xmath80 in which the sum rule is valid ( cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "following @xcite we determine the minimal borel mass such that the last accessible contribution to the ope ( [ eq : opegen ] ) , i.e.  here the @xmath82 term , amounts to 10% of the total ope result : @xmath83 the maximal borel mass is chosen such that the continuum contribution to the r.h.s .  of ( [ eq : sumrule ] )",
    "does not become larger than the contribution from the resonance which we want to study , i.e. @xmath84 as a guideline one can expect that @xmath85 scales with the point where the average strength of @xmath86 is located , i.e.  with the resonance mass ( squared ) .",
    "hence for large ( small ) resonance masses the value of @xmath85 will be large ( small ) .",
    "it might appear that in some cases the borel window between @xmath87 and @xmath85 is rather small or even closed .",
    "then the sum rule is meaningless .",
    "in practice the determination of the borel window provides a quality check for the sum rule .",
    "the borel sum rule ( [ eq : sumrule ] ) is not the only sum rule which is used to connect hadronic and qcd based information . inserting ( [ eq : pihadans ] ) in ( [ eq : sumrule ] ) and expanding the r.h.s .  in powers of @xmath59",
    "one can compare the coefficients of this expansion with the respective ones in the series on the l.h.s .  given by ( [ eq : opegen ] ) .",
    "this yields the finite energy sum rules ( presented here for the @xmath0 meson for the vacuum case )    [ eq : fesr ] @xmath88    where the coefficients of the ope are given in ( [ eq : coeffrho ] ) , evaluated in this section for @xmath89 .    the first two of these sum rules are utilized e.g.  in @xcite .",
    "obviously the expansion of the r.h.s .",
    "of ( [ eq : sumrule ] ) relies on the assumption that the borel sum rule obtained by the simple decomposition ( [ eq : pihadans ] ) is valid for arbitrary high values of @xmath80 . as pointed out above this",
    "is doubtful due to the limited knowledge of @xmath81 in the threshold region .",
    "actually the sensitivity of the respective finite energy sum rule on the details of @xmath81 around @xmath56 is increasing when going from ( [ eq : fesr1 ] ) to ( [ eq : fesr3 ] ) .",
    "thus it might be safe to extract information from the lowest finite energy sum rule(s ) . utilizing higher ones , however ,",
    "becomes more and more doubtful .",
    "this is the reason why we prefer to use the borel sum rule .",
    "in addition , for the latter one a consistency check on its validity is provided by the determination of the borel window . )",
    "is unrealistic .",
    "it is only used to avoid new additional parameters . introducing instead a smooth cross - over",
    "one can test the sensitivity of the finite energy sum rules on these new parameters which model the cross - over region .",
    "if a finite energy sum rule appears to be fairly insensitive to these new parameters it might be regarded as useful . ]    nonetheless , the finite energy sum rules can be used to get a qualitative picture about the connection of the ope side to resonance parameters like mass and width .",
    "in fact , @xmath90 is a mass distribution .",
    "therefore it appears natural to define the first two moments of this distribution , i.e.  an average mass and a width via @xmath91 and @xmath92 obviously , the finite energy sum rules ( [ eq : fesr ] ) can be used to connect these moments with the condensates ( and the continuum threshold ) : @xmath93 @xmath94 we can learn two things from these simple relations : first , the average mass is determined by the dimension-4 ( gluon and two - quark ) condensates and the continuum threshold while the dimension-6 condensates ( here the four - quark condensate ) influence only the width .",
    "second , we do not have enough information at hand to determine all the phenomenological parameters . in our case at hand",
    "we have three of them , namely the continuum threshold @xmath56 and the two moments @xmath95 and @xmath96 . on the other hand we only have two equations for these parameters . traditionally , the use of qcd sum rules is accompanied by an additional assumption , namely that the width is negligible . in this case the mass can be determined . in general , however , the best we can hope to gain are correlations between the free parameters .",
    "being especially interested in mass and width we can vary @xmath56 and determine the corresponding values for @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : correl ] .",
    "( for the four - quark condensate ( [ eq : fourravac ] ) we have chosen the larger value . )",
    "the most important thing to note here is that the width grows with rising mass .",
    "we will find correlations of this kind again and again throughout this work .",
    "the qualitative understanding of this correlation is obtained from the simple relations ( [ eq : avmasscond],[eq : gawicond ] ) .",

    "[ fig : vaca1l4q ] and [ fig : vaca1 ] we find that a decrease in the four - quark condensate shifts the band to some extent to the left but merely downwards .",

    "we find that the smaller value for the four - quark condensate ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vaca1 ] ) appears to be much better suited  quite opposite to the case of the @xmath0 meson where the larger value provides a better fit . in principle",

    "we note that for the @xmath1 vacuum case a further reduction of the four - quark condensate does not improve the agreement between the sum rule and the experimental results as the band is further shifted downwards and not to the left .",

    "if the resonance appears to be closer to the continuum the sum rule is more sensitive to the details of the modeling of the nearby transition to the continuum .",
    "such details are necessarily rather crude in our ansatz ( [ eq : pihadans ] ) .",
    "finally we present the results for the borel window for the preferable parameter choice ( fig .",

    "we note that we have not included the pion branch in the determination ( [ eq : mmax ] ) of the maximal borel mass to make sure that we really learn something about the properties of the @xmath1 meson .",
    "next we turn to the case of finite nuclear density .",
    "as pointed out by several groups ( e.g.  @xcite ) the interaction of the @xmath0 meson with the pion cloud of the nucleons induces a mixing of the @xmath0 with its chiral partner the @xmath1 meson .",
    "this means that e.g.  the ( possibly medium - modified ) @xmath1-peak shows up in the spectral distribution @xmath131 of the _ vector _ correlator and vice versa .",
    "suppose now that one would ignore that multi - peak structure and still parametrize @xmath131 with only one peak according to ( [ eq : pihadans],[eq : parares ] ) . in a qcd sum rule analysis one",
    "has only access on certain mass averages of the spectral distribution on account of ( [ eq : sumrule ] ) . hence with a one - peak structure ansatz",
    "one would translate certain in - medium changes of the ope side to changes of mass and width of this peak which in reality , however , are caused by the appearance of other distinct peaks",
    ". this would be rather misleading .",
    "indeed , for the comparable case of finite temperature @xmath2 it has been shown @xcite that the masses of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , if understood as the positions of peaks in spectral distributions , do not change in the linear ( pion ) density approximation .",
    "modification at finite temperature corresponds exactly to @xmath132 at finite baryon density ( cf .",
    "e.g.  eq .",
    "( 3 ) in @xcite ) . ] only if the notion of mass is used with a different meaning ( e.g.  in the spirit of sec .",
    "[ sec : fesr ] as the first moment of a spectral distribution ) it would be correct to attribute an in - medium @xmath3 mass shift to this `` mass '' . for considerations beyond the @xmath3 approximation",
    "we refer to @xcite .    concerning the present work the mass @xmath106 of a resonance ( which shows up in the spectral distribution of the current correlator ) is defined via ( [ eq : spec ] ) . for small width",
    "it gives the peak position of the resonance . in the following for our case of finite nucleon density",
    "we also try to account for the multi - peak structures caused by mixing of vector and axial - vector currents . if we only used the sum rule ( [ eq : sumrule ] ) and introduced more than one peak e.g.  in ( [ eq : parares ] ) we would have too many free parameters to draw any meaningful conclusion .",
    "therefore ( as for the case of finite temperature @xcite ) the key idea is to isolate the contribution of the respective new in - medium peak(s ) also for the ope side . in this way one obtains sum rules for non -",
    "mixed correlators ( in the following called `` bare '' ) which can be analyzed with the one - peak ansatz ( plus continuum , of course ) .",
    "these ( in general unobservable ) bare correlators mix to yield finally the `` full '' in - medium correlators . the imaginary part of the latter in principle can be observed ( cf .  e.g.  ( [ eq : crosssec ] ) ) .",
    "we note that for the case of finite temperature the bare correlators coincide with the vacuum correlators in the linear density approximation @xcite .",
    "as we shall see in the following , things are not so simple for the case of finite nucleon density .    to account for the interaction of the nuclear pions with the vector- and axial - vector currents nuclear matter",
    "is separated into a fermi gas of bare nucleons plus soft pions , schematically @xcite @xmath133 where @xmath134 denotes the full nuclear matter state vector while @xmath135 denotes the bare one .",
    "the current - current correlator ( [ eq : curcur ] ) evaluated with respect to @xmath134 can now be decomposed into a bare correlator , i.e.  a correlator with respect to @xmath135 , and a part involving the interaction with ( soft ) pions : @xmath136 the latter one is approximately evaluated using soft pion techniques ( cf .  also @xcite ) and taking into account up to two pions in the initial and/or final state .",

    "finally the expectation values in ( [ eq : krsoft ] ) have to be weighted by the density of pions in the nuclear medium . for the dimensionless quantities defined in ( [ eq : decompmunu ] )",

    "this is in agreement with @xcite but in contrast to @xcite where a negative value has been used .",
    "our choice for @xmath146 is motivated by the fact that this ensures that the two correlators @xmath36 and @xmath151 become degenerate at some finite density : @xmath152 a negative value for @xmath146 would lead to anti - mixing , i.e.  in this case the nuclear pions would work against chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "next we will perform a sum rule analysis for the correlators with respect to the system of bare nucleons @xmath142 at nuclear saturation density @xmath153@xmath154 .",
    "concerning the vector channel this is the essential difference as compared to our previous work @xcite where we have analyzed the sum rule for the full in - medium correlator @xmath36 .",
    "note that ( [ eq : coeffrho ] ) ,  ( [ eq : coeffa1 ] ) are valid for both full and bare correlators .",
    "the difference appears in ( [ eq : lindens ] ) in the calculation of the expectation value with respect to bare or full nucleons , respectively . in practice ,",
    "the difference manifests itself only in the different handling of the four - quark condensate .",
    "all ope contributions in ( [ eq : coeffrho ] ) and ( [ eq : coeffa1 ] ) except from the two- and four - quark condensates come from chiral singlet operators .",
    "they do not distinguish between bare nucleons and nucleons dressed by soft pions .",
    "hence their evaluation is standard @xcite .",
    "things are different for the two- and four - quark condensates . concerning the two - quark condensate , its in - medium change ( in linear density approximation )",
    "is determined by the nucleon sigma term ( [ eq : defsigma ] ) . to calculate the in - medium change with respect to bare nucleons we have to take into account only @xmath155 as defined via ( [ eq : splitnuclsig ] ) : @xmath156 in practice ,",
    "the value of @xmath157 is rather small ( as compared to the gluon condensate ) and further diminished in the medium .",
    "in contrast , the four - quark condensate is numerically important . in lack of a better access to the value of @xmath158 at finite density we made in @xcite the common assumption that this four - quark condensate scales with the density like the square of the two - quark condensate @xmath159 in the comparable case of finite temperature ( i.e.  in a hot pion gas )",
    ", however , it was shown in @xcite that such an assumption is wrong .",
    "this can be traced back to the fact that in the presence of pions the two - quark condensate behaves different as compared to the four - quark condensate due to its different transformation properties with respect to chiral transformations .",
    "this suggests that also at finite nucleon density the scaling assumption ( [ eq : fourdens ] ) is doubtful due to the presence of virtual pions . in the present work we have explicitly taken into account the contribution from the pion cloud of the nucleons . in this way we have expressed the full correlator in terms of the bare correlators",
    "we now assume the scaling property ( [ eq : fourdens ] ) only for the condensates with respect to a system of bare nucleons .",
    "it takes the form @xmath160 where for consistency we have to take the bare nucleon sigma term @xmath161mev instead of the full one @xmath162mev . in the following we use this scaling assumption ( [ eq : fourdensbare ] ) for both @xmath163 and @xmath164 .    in view of the uncertainty connected with the four - quark condensate",
    "it clearly would be fortunate to use sum rules which do not involve it .",
    "indeed , in @xcite the first two finite energy sum rules ( [ eq : fesr1],[eq : fesr2 ] ) were used . however , with the same parameter set @xmath165 characterizing the hadronic correlator the two sum rules are capable to determine only two of these four parameters . to further restrict the parameter space additional information is required . in @xcite",
    "it is suggested that the threshold @xmath56 is connected to the scale of chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "thus , the choice is either to make assumptions about the four - quark condensate or about the threshold parameter .",
    "as outlined above we prefer to work with the borel sum rule instead of the finite energy sum rules due to the larger sensitivity of the latter to the high energy modeling . in this case",
    "we can not get rid of the four - quark condensate .",
    "the sum rule analysis proceeds along the same lines as described above for the vacuum case .",
    "we analyze the borel sum rules for the @xmath0 as well as the @xmath1 meson placed in a medium of _ bare _ nucleons . for the time - like part of the correlator in the vector channel we use again a single resonance parametrization of type ( [ eq : parares ] ) . for the axial - vector channel",
    "we recall that there is a pion branch in addition to the @xmath1 . here",
    "there is an additional change in the medium due to a change of the pion decay constant in nuclear matter .",
    "we replace @xmath166 in ( [ eq : pararesa1 ] ) by @xmath167 where we have utilized the in - medium version of the gell - mann  oakes  renner relation ( [ eq : gor ] ) and neglected a possible in - medium change of the pion mass . by using ( [ eq :",
    "pararesa1 ] ) with the replacement ( [ eq : fpistar ] ) we also assume that the delta - type spectral function of the pion is not significantly smeared out . in fact , pion properties are expected to change drastically in nuclear matter due to the strong coupling to delta - hole states @xcite .",
    "however , this @xmath117-wave coupling is not important here since we deal with correlators which are at rest with respect to the nuclear environment .",

    "in fact , even if we allowed for larger values of @xmath122 there would be no sign for the desired mass - width band .",
    "we conclude that parametrization ( [ eq : widtha1vac ] ) is incompatible with the in - medium sum rule for the @xmath1 meson .",
    "obviously this sum rule demands for a spectral distribution which is smeared out over a large invariant mass range . restricting the mass range by a ( rather high ) lower limit of @xmath172gev appears to be insufficient to fulfill the sum rule .",
    "instead , the one - pion threshold ( caused by nucleon-@xmath1 collisions ) does the job . of course ,",
    "also other scenarios which might fulfill the sum rule are conceivable . as we have learned from the previous in - medium sum rule analysis the spectral function of the @xmath0 meson gains strength at lower invariant mass ( either by a lower peak mass or by a larger width ) .",
    "thus the effective threshold for the in - medium decay of the @xmath1 meson into rho plus pion is probably lowered as compared to the vacuum case .",
    "such a scenario might also be in line with the sum rule .",
    "we have not explored this possibility in further detail since we would have to introduce a couple of new free parameters to model e.g.  the successive in - medium decays @xmath173 .",
    "as already noticed when discussing the results for the @xmath0 meson we find also for the @xmath1 that the qcd sum rule is sensitive to the threshold modeling of the width provided that the on - shell width is not too small . this fact has not been sufficiently taken into account in @xcite leading to results for the @xmath1 meson which differ from the ones presented here .",
    "we also deduce from fig .",
    "[ fig : meda1 ] that the nominal peak mass is shifted to higher values .",
    "it is important to note that this shift is _ not _ in contradiction to chiral symmetry .",
    "what we have studied so far is the behavior of the correlators under the influence of the system of _ bare _ nucleons .",
    "chiral symmetry only demands that the _ full _ correlators of the vector and axial - vector channel become degenerate at high enough density .",
    "this is achieved by the pions as expressed by the mixing formula ( [ eq : difdeg ] ) no matter how the @xmath1 mass changes under the influence of the bare nucleons .    to visualize the effect of mixing we now turn to the full in - medium correlators obtained from the bare ones via ( [ eq : mixing ] ) . as already pointed out the sum rule analysis in general",
    "is not capable to pin down both in - medium mass and width for the respective meson . nonetheless , to illustrate the effect of mixing we arbitrarily take one pair of values for the @xmath0 meson from the inner band depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : medrho ] and the optimal pair for the @xmath1 meson .",
    "we choose :    [ eq : specval ] @xmath174    the results for the imaginary part of the full in - medium vector and axial - vector correlators are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : fullspecrho ] and [ fig : fullspeca1 ] together with the respective contributions from the bare correlators . in the figures we have not included the delta function type contributions from the pion and from landau damping .",
    "note that the shoulder of the @xmath0 contribution at low invariant mass is caused by the @xmath175 factor present in ( [ eq : parares ] ) . especially the axial - vector correlator shows that in the medium the resonance peaks are no longer higher than the high energy continuum .",
    "recalling that the modeling of the onset of the continuum is rather crude one might further soften the crossover regions leaving basically no room for distinct peak structures . in total , we see a clear sign that the in - medium spectral distributions get washed out with increasing density .",
    "we have presented a qcd sum rule analysis for the in - medium current - current correlators with the quantum numbers of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons . for the medium we have chosen the case of a fermi gas of nucleons at vanishing temperature . for comparison",
    "we have also presented the vacuum sum rule analysis for @xmath0 and @xmath1 . as possible in - medium changes for the spectral distributions of both correlators we have allowed for mass - shifts , peak broadening and also mixing .",
    "the latter effect has not been considered in previous analyses @xcite .    in the qcd sum rule",
    "only a mass - averaged quantity involving the respective spectral distribution enters .",
    "in general the sum rule is not capable to pin down the full information present in the spectral distribution like the number of peaks , their positions , widths and heights .",
    "therefore one needs an ansatz for the spectral distribution with some free parameters .",
    "these parameters can be constrained by the requirement that the spectral distribution has to fulfill the sum rule .",
    "the simplest ansatz consists of only one peak ( in the low energy regime ) and neglecting its width . in this case the sum rule for the @xmath0 meson demands an in - medium mass shift towards smaller masses @xcite . at normal nuclear matter density the mass has to drop by roughly 16% .",
    "this , however , is a model dependent statement since a specific choice for the form of the spectral distribution has been made , namely only one peak with vanishing width .",
    "in fact , if also the width is included but still using a one - peak ansatz it is already impossible to fix both the mass and the width .",
    "one obtains a band of allowed mass - width pairs @xcite . at small width",
    "this band of course has to start at the mass determined in @xcite  provided the same condensate values are used ( cf .",
    "@xcite for details ) . for larger widths",
    "the allowed masses also increase . with increasing nucleon density the mass - width band",
    "is shifted to the left , i.e.  for a given value of the width to smaller masses .",
    "if the true in - medium spectral distribution possesses more than one peak but in the ansatz for that quantity only one peak was present then certain in - medium changes caused by the additional peaks would be erroneously attributed to changes of mass and/or width of the single peak .",
    "therefore , in the present work we have made a further step to consider all possible in - medium modifications .",
    "the mixing of the vector with the axial - vector correlator by the virtual nuclear pions has been included .",
    "using soft pion techniques this mixing can be approximately calculated for the correlators irrespective of the choice for the correlator momentum @xmath4 .",
    "therefore the correlators can be decomposed into a superposition of `` bare '' correlators for both the ope side ( @xmath5 ) and the spectral distribution ( @xmath35 ) . in this way we have split off the mixing phenomena ( at least the one induced by nuclear pions ) from the sum rule analysis .",
    "successively the latter has been applied to the bare correlators . as compared to previous works",
    "we have obtained a less drastic in - medium shift of the allowed mass - width band for the @xmath0 branch . for the @xmath1 branch we have found that the sum rule is better fulfilled for not too small values of the width .",
    "the preference of large widths increases with increasing density .",
    "we have also seen that for both the @xmath0 and @xmath1 meson at larger widths the respective sum rule is sensitive to the threshold modeling of the energy dependence of the width .",
    "therefore , it appears to be insufficient to characterize a peak in the spectral distribution by its position and on - shell width .",
    "a reasonable modeling of the energy dependence of the width is important to obtain meaningful results from a qcd sum rule analysis .",
    "as already mentioned we have found that there is a smaller in - medium shift of the mass - width band for the @xmath0 meson as compared to the old analysis which did not include the mixing phenomena . at first glance",
    "this is a striking result .",
    "suppose that the old analysis is polluted by an additional @xmath1 peak , i.e.  a peak at large invariant masses .",
    "first of all , one might argue that this additional peak is suppressed by the exponential function appearing in ( [ eq : sumrule ] ) .",
    "therefore this peak should not drastically modify the analysis for the @xmath0 meson as generally assumed for all details of the high - energy part . note that figs .",
    "[ fig : fullspecrho ] and [ fig : fullspeca1 ] show that in general the position of the @xmath1 peak is beyond the onset of the continuum of the @xmath0 branch , cf .  also ( [ eq : specval ] ) .",
    "let us ignore that point for a moment and face a second apparent contradiction of our results to naive expectations .",
    "consider the influence of the additional @xmath1 peak on the determined mass ( for a given width ) .",
    "clearly the mass which we have attributed to the @xmath0 meson in the old analysis would be a weighted average of the true @xmath0 peak and the @xmath1 peak .",
    "therefore the true @xmath0 peak should be at smaller mass values as compared to the result of the old analysis . in the present analysis , however , we have found just the opposite result .",
    "the solution to these apparent contradictions is the appearance of the pion in the axial - vector branch .",
    "it is not the high lying @xmath1 but the low lying pion which has dominantly pollutes the old analysis . since the pion is much lighter than the @xmath0",
    "the former has caused a too large shift of the mass - width band to the left in the old analysis .",
    "the @xmath1 peak plays only a subdominant role as expected from modifications in the high energy regime .",
    "after the decomposition of the full correlators into bare ones we have tacitly assumed that for the latter the one - peak ansatz for ( the low energy part of ) the spectral distribution is reasonable . in fact , also this assumption appears to be questionable due to the coupling of the @xmath0-nucleon system to resonances ( cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) . especially the apparently sizable coupling to the @xmath176 resonance @xmath177 might create an additional peak at an invariant mass of roughly @xmath178mev , i.e.  below the vacuum @xmath0 peak - wave coupling to @xmath179-@xmath0 can contribute for the case at hand since we have considered @xmath0 mesons at rest with respect to the nuclear medium . on account of the linear density approximation we have neglected the fermi motion of the nucleons . ]",
    " provided that the resonance mass does not change in the nuclear medium .",
    "therefore e.g.  our result for the in - medium mass - width band of the @xmath0 branch might still be polluted by the influence of additional distinct peaks .",
    "we have refrained from including more than one peak in the ansatz for the spectral distribution since we would have been forced to introduce much more free parameters which can not be determined from the sum rule .",
    "further work is necessary to separate the different peaks .",
    "on the other hand , we have already seen that the present sum rule analysis supports broad in - medium spectral functions .",
    "it may appear that the baryonic resonances also melt in a nuclear environment ( cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) and leave no sign of distinct peaks in the mesonic channels .    concerning the included mixing effect of the vector and axial - vector channel the amount of mixing",
    "is determined by the value for @xmath146 . as we have already mentioned",
    "even the sign of that quantity is still subject to discussion .",
    "the influence of @xmath146 is two - fold .",
    "first , it yields the amount of mixing on account of ( [ eq : mixing ] ) . here a change of @xmath146 does not influence the sum rule analysis for the bare correlators but it does influence the final result for the full correlators exemplified in figs .  [",
    "fig : fullspecrho ] and [ fig : fullspeca1 ] . especially if @xmath146 was negative one could no longer guarantee that the sign of the imaginary parts of the full correlators remains positive for all values of the invariant mass @xmath112 . in this case the approximations which have led to ( [ eq : mixing ] ) should be revised .",
    "the second place where @xmath146 appears is the in - medium dependence of the quark condensates .",
    "most importantly , it enters the scaling assumption ( [ eq : fourdensbare ] ) for the four - quark condensate via ( [ eq : splitnuclsig ] ) .",
    "we have made this assumption in lack of any better , more fundamental approach .",
    "one might corroborate our choice by the expectation that factorization roughly works as long as there is no fundamental ( symmetry ) principle which is in contradiction to factorization . in our case",
    "the interaction with the pions is determined by chiral symmetry . here",
    "factorization breaks down as proven for the case of finite temperature in @xcite .",
    "having split off the pions one might expect that the factorization assumption works for the interaction of the vector and axial - vector mesons with the bare nucleons .",
    "nonetheless it is important to figure out how important the influence of the four - quark condensate and especially of its in - medium change actually is : at a typical value for the borel mass of @xmath180gev we find the following in - medium changes on the ope side of the @xmath0 meson sum rule at nuclear saturation density : the important changes are induced by the twist - two condensate with dimension four , @xmath181 , and the in - medium change of the four - quark condensate , @xmath182 .",
    "all other changes are an order of magnitude smaller : @xmath183 from the in - medium change of the gluon condensate , @xmath184 from the in - medium change of the two - quark condensate , @xmath185 from the twist - two condensate with dimension six .",
    "therefore even if the change of the four - quark condensate was completely neglected roughly two thirds of the in - medium change would still persist .",
    "thus , the results obtained here would not drastically change .",
    "the vacuum contribution of the four - quark condensate is @xmath186 .",
    "if the four - quark condensate vanished completely at nuclear saturation density the in - medium change would be twice as large as the one used in our analysis .",
    "one should realize that the previous considerations are somewhat oversimplified as the dependence on the borel mass is different for the ope contributions from the dimension - four condensates as compared to the ones with dimension six . in total ,",
    "however , we do not expect qualitative changes of the picture presented here even if the in - medium behavior of the four - quark condensate was completely different .    in spite of the large uncertainties connected with the qcd sum rule method at finite baryon density we regard it as a useful complement to purely hadronic approaches since it connects in a unique way hadronic with quark - gluon degrees of freedom .",
    "we hope that the mentioned uncertainties can be removed step by step in the future .",
