    "of the 171 planets that have been found orbiting stars within 200  pc of the sun , the vast majority of have been discovered by measuring doppler reflex motion of their parent stars @xcite .",
    "effectively detecting the relatively small doppler shifts caused by planet - sized bodies requires velocity precision of order 1  .",
    "this corresponds to measuring shifts in spectral lines to within @xmath1 of a resolution element for modern echelle spectrometers such as keck hires @xcite .",
    "such a feat requires intimate knowledge of wavelength scale of the spectrometer detector .",
    "however , the wavelength scale is not constant with time .",
    "the instrument is subject to changes on time scales as short as hours or even minutes due to effects such as telescope flexure and thermal expansion .",
    "it is therefore necessary to measure the wavelength scale for each observation using a reference spectrum obtained simultaneously with the stellar spectrum .",
    "one of the most successful and widely  used precision velocity methods is the iodine cell technique ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter b96 ) .",
    "the b96 technique uses an iodine cell placed in front of the entrance slit of an echelle spectrometer , which imprints a dense set of narrow molecular lines on each stellar spectrum .",
    "velocity information is extracted by fitting a model consisting of a stellar template spectrum multiplied by an iodine reference spectrum and convolved with an instrumental profile , or psf .",
    "the shape of the psf , wavelength scale of the spectrometer , and the doppler shift of the stellar template are left as free parameters in the fit .",
    "the stellar template spectrum is an observation of the target star obtained without the iodine cell , with the instrumental profile deconvolved . because numerical deconvolution algorithms are highly susceptible to noise amplification ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , template observations must have high signal - to - noise ( s / r  @xmath2 ) and high spectral resolution ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "both of these requirements result in longer exposure times compared to program observations made through the iodine cell .",
    "one observing program for which this telescope time overhead is prohibitive is the next 2000 stars ( n2k ) planet search ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) .",
    "n2k is an international consortium designed to search for short  period planets ( @xmath4  d , commonly known as `` hot jupiters '' ) orbiting metal  rich stars residing within 110 parsecs of the sun . as telescope time is allocated at each of three major telescopes  keck , magellan and subaru  each target star is monitored for three consecutive nights .",
    "those stars exhibiting radial velocity ( rv ) variations between 20 and 250  are flagged for follow - up spectroscopic observations to search for a full orbital solution .",
    "planet candidates also receive photometric monitoring with the automatic photometric telescopes ( apt ) at fairborn observatory @xcite to search for transit events . to date ,",
    "this `` quick ",
    "look '' observing strategy has resulted in the detection of four short  period planets ( paper i ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , one of which , hd 149026 , transits its host star @xcite .",
    "most n2k target stars receive only three rv observations , which means that template observations represent more than 25% of the telescope time required for the program .",
    "since template observations contain no inherent velocity information , it would be highly advantageous to bypass them by measuring doppler shifts with respect to synthetic reference spectra . using this motivation ,",
    "we have developed a modification to the b96 velocity method whereby we derive the shape of the intrinsic stellar spectrum directly from normal iodine cell observations .",
    "this synthetic , or `` morphed , '' template is then used in place of a deconvolved template in the b96 modeling process .",
    "we present an overview of the forward modeling procedure used to produce morphed templates in ",
    "[ method ] . in   [ testing ]",
    "we show the results of several tests of both the short and long  term precision attainable from morphed templates using keck / hires observations of a set of velocity standard stars . in   [ application ] we detail how this new method is currently being used in the n2k planet search .",
    "we also report the detection of three new short  period planets , and describe the results of our photometric monitoring of the host stars for transit events . finally , in   [ discussion ] we summarize our results , propose other potential applications for spectral morphing and discuss the new planet discoveries with respect to the growing statistical ensemble of short  period exoplanets .",
    "the b96 precision velocity technique employs a temperature  controlled pyrex cell containing gaseous molecular iodine placed at the entrance slit of a spectrometer .",
    "the iodine lines imprinted on the stellar spectrum serve as a robust wavelength fiducial against which the doppler shift of the stellar lines is measured .",
    "the doppler information from each iodine observation is extracted using a forward modeling algorithm described in detail by b96 and summarized below .",
    "depending on the format of the echelle spectrometer , the stellar spectra are broken into 600 to 1000 2  wide spectral chunks , and each chunk is modeled as    @xmath5 * psf,\\ ] ]    where @xmath6 is a normalization factor , psf is the model of the spectrometer s instrumental response , and `` * '' denotes a convolution .",
    "the fitting procedure is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ dop_example ] .",
    "the doppler shift , @xmath7 , is applied to the deconvolved stellar template , dst , while the iodine reference spectrum , @xmath8 , determines the wavelength scale of the spectral chunk .",
    "the stellar template is multiplied by the iodine template , and the product is convolved with the psf and fit to the observed spectrum .",
    "the fitting procedure requires two template spectra : the deconvolved stellar template and the iodine transmission spectrum .",
    "the iodine spectrum has been measured at high resolution ( r @xmath9 200,000 ) and high signal - to - noise ( s /",
    "n  @xmath9  700 ) using the fourier transform spectrometer at kitt peak national observatory . while the same iodine template can be used for every rv observation , the stellar template must be measured for each individual target star .",
    "stellar template observations are made without the iodine cell in the spectrometer light path , and are obtained with higher resolution and signal - to - noise ratios than typical iodine observations .",
    "templates also require bracketing iodine spectra of rapidly rotating b stars , which are used to measure the spectrometer psf and wavelength scale at the approximate time of the template observation .",
    "the psf is then removed using a modified jansson deconvolution algorithm @xcite .",
    "our modification to the b96 reduction procedure is to derive the dst directly from an iodine observation , thereby circumventing the separate template observation for each target .",
    "we use a modeling procedure similar to eqn .",
    "[ iodine_model ] , replacing the deconvolved stellar template , dst , with a synthetic , or `` morphed , '' template spectrum .",
    "the shape of the spectrum is varied until , when multiplied by the iodine spectrum and convolved with the psf , a fit is obtained to the stellar iodine observation .",
    "this morphed deconvolved template",
    "is then substituted for the dst in eqn .",
    "[ iodine_model ] during the velocity analysis of the target star s iodine observations .",
    "the fitting procedure requires an accurate initial guess of the shape of the morphed dst .",
    "a spectrum derived from a model stellar atmosphere would seem like an ideal choice , since each individual spectral line could be described analytically .",
    "but the fit of eqn .",
    "[ iodine_model ] to the observed spectrum is highly sensitive to the exact positions of spectral lines in the dst .",
    "small mismatches between model and observed spectra caused by effects such as convective blueshift can be compensated by asymmetric adjustments to the psf model , which can in turn lead to spurious doppler shifts @xcite .",
    "modern stellar atmosphere models can not accurately account for the identification and exact wavelengths of each of the thousands of lines spanning the 1000  wide iodine region .    instead , we find that an existing observed dst with characteristics similar to the target star works the best as the initial guess of the shape of morphed template .",
    "stars with similar surface gravity , effective temperature and chemical composition differ only slightly in the depth and width of individual spectral lines .",
    "we have built a library of dsts for 42 stars spanning the main  sequence and subgiant branch of the hr diagram , with hipparcos colors @xmath10 @xcite , and projected equatorial radial velocities @xmath11  as measured by @xcite .",
    "the library templates were observed as part of the regular california & carnegie planet search ( ccps , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , using the keck / hires echelle spectrometer with the 0.38 arcsecond wide e2 decker , which yields a spectral resolution of @xmath12 at 5500   .",
    "each library template observation consists of 3 to 5 sequential exposures , with coadded signal  to  noise ratios ranging from 800 to 1000 .",
    "the psf is derived from a set of bracketing b star / iodine spectra and removed from the template spectrum using the modified jansson deconvolution algorithm ( b96 ) .",
    "the morphing procedure begins by selecting 3 to 6 library template stars with hipparcos colors and absolute visual magnitudes similar to the target star .",
    "the non  deconvolved template spectra of the candidate library stars are then cross  correlated against the target star s `` pseudo  template , '' which is created by dividing the star  plus  iodine observation by a b star / iodine spectrum from the same observing run .",
    "the library template that yields strongest cross ",
    "correlation peak , averaged over all orders , is chosen as the initial guess for the shape of the deconvolved stellar template .",
    "with the first  guess spectrum established , the model we use to derive the morphed dst is    @xmath13 * psf\\ ] ]    where @xmath14 represents a transformation of the library deconvolved template",
    ". we do not allow the psf to vary , but instead derive its shape from a b star / iodine spectrum obtained near the time of the observation of the target star .",
    "as in eqn .",
    "[ iodine_model ] , the dst is shifted by @xmath7 .",
    "but in eqn .",
    "[ morph_model ] the shape of the spectrum is also allowed to vary by adjusting the depths of individual lines and globally broadening the spectrum with a rotational broadening kernel corresponding to an equatorial rotation velocity @xmath15 .    as with the b96 method ,",
    "the fit is carried out on individual 2  wide spectral chunks .",
    "however , in order to modify the line depths of the dst , the spectral chunks are further divided into individual line segments using an automated search algorithm .",
    "the algorithm first locates the minima in the dst that lie further than @xmath16 below the nominal continuum level , and then traces along the line wings until either the continuum or a neighboring line segment is encountered .",
    "neighboring line segments corresponding to line blends are merged and the blend is treated as a single line ; a compromise necessary to avoid cross talk between the two segments .",
    "the transformation function can be expressed as    @xmath17\\}\\ ] ]    where dst@xmath18 is the @xmath19th spectral segment of the library dst , which is scaled by a factor @xmath20 .",
    "the rotational broadening kernel , @xmath21 , is computed with a linear limb  darkening coefficient appropriate for the star s @xmath22 color and the mean wavelength of the iodine spectral region @xcite .",
    "[ morph_example ] shows an example of a morphed deconvolved template , together with the resulting fit of eqn .",
    "[ morph_model ] to an observed stellar iodine observation and the fit residuals .    since the library dst is continuum normalized , the logarithmic term in eqn .",
    "[ morphing ] can be thought of as a pseudo optical depth under optically thin conditions .",
    "our choice of this functional form is obviously not motivated by physical considerations since the spectral lines in the template are not optically thin . instead , we chose it because it has the desirable behavior of leaving the continuum unchanged while the depth adjustment is applied smoothly from the line wings to the core .",
    "this has the effect of stretching the line in a somewhat elastic fashion . to enforce continuity from one line segment to the next , each segment has a pseudo continuum level such that portions of dst@xmath18 that lie above this level are left unchanged . for a given line segment ,",
    "the pseudo continuum is the lesser of either the value at the left segment boundary or 98% of the stellar continuum .    in most cases , particularly with n2k targets , we derive the morphed dst from a single iodine observation .",
    "however , since the fitting procedure is carried out in the rest frame of the library star , a refined solution can be obtained by fitting eqn .",
    "[ morph_model ] to multiple spectral observations .",
    "the composite morphed dst is formed by replacing the line depths , @xmath20 , in eqn .",
    "[ morphing ] with the weighted average ,    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the line depth adjustment for the @xmath19th segment of the fit to the @xmath25th observation , and @xmath26 is the standard deviation of the residuals of the fit of eqn .",
    "[ morph_model ] . the broadening kernel is similarly averaged over all observations .",
    "the n2k planet search uses a quick  look observing strategy to efficiently search for short  period planet candidates within a set of @xmath27 target stars .",
    "stars are typically monitored over three consecutive nights , and those exhibiting conspicuous rv variations ",
    "typically @xmath28are flagged for follow  up observations .",
    "a jupiter  mass planet in a short  period ( @xmath29  d ) orbit will produce velocity variations of order hundreds of meters per second , necessitating only modest velocity precision",
    ". however , the number of extrasolar planets rises sharply with decreasing planet mass as @xmath30 @xcite , which makes it crucial that we attain the highest possible precision in order to detect saturn  mass planets .",
    "for example , a @xmath31m@xmath32 planet in a 15  d orbit around a solar  mass star induces rv variations with an amplitude of only 25  . reliably detecting this relatively low  amplitude signal from three velocity measurements made during consecutive nights requires a short  term measurement precision better than @xmath33  .",
    "we are also interested in the long  term performance of morphed templates .",
    "while most stars are monitored over consecutive nights , the velocity measurements of some stars have to be split up over several runs when telescope time is lost to weather .",
    "also , it would be ideal if morphed dsts are stable enough from one run to the next to allow for follow  up without having to obtain a traditional template observation . in the following subsections",
    "we compare both the short and long  term velocity performance of morphed dsts to observed templates .      in august 2004 , the keck",
    "/ hires spectrometer was upgraded with a new detector .",
    "the previous 2k  @xmath34  2k pixel tektronix ccd was replaced by an array of three 4k  @xmath34  2k pixel mit - ll ccds .",
    "the new detector produces much higher velocity precision due to its improved charge transfer efficiency and charge diffusion characteristics ; smaller resolution elements ( 15  @xmath35 pixels compared to the old 24  @xmath35 pixels ) ; higher quantum efficiency ; increased spectral coverage ; and lower read noise .",
    "since the detector upgrade , we have monitored a set of 32 chromospherically inactive stars as part of the california & carnegie planet search in order to evaluate the rv precision of our doppler reduction pipeline .",
    "each of these rv `` standard '' stars has received intensive monitoring during at least one observing run , with multiple observations spanning consecutive nights . additionally , 14 of the stars have also been observed during at least five separate observing runs spanning more than a year and a half . typical signal  to  noise ratios range from 600 to more than 1000 , depending on the star s apparent magnitude , with a spectral resolution @xmath36 at 5500   .",
    "we used these `` standard '' stars to perform a differential evaluation of the velocity precision of morphed versus observed dsts .",
    "figure [ vel_comparo1 ] shows an rv plot for one of the more intensely observed standard stars , hd  185144 ( spectral type k0v ) .",
    "the top panels show the velocities measured using an observed dst and the bottom panels show the velocities derived from a morphed dst .",
    "the velocities measured from a morphed template exhibit a long  term rms scatter of 2.16  , compared to 1.66   for the observed template .",
    "the short  term rms for the morphed template velocities is nearly identical to that of the observed template ( 1.44   versus 1.56  ) .",
    "figure  [ vel_comparo2 ] shows a similar velocity comparison for hd  9407 ( g0v ) . in this case , the observed  template velocities have rms  @xmath37  for both the short and long  term test cases , while the scatters in the morphed  template velocities are about 2 and 3 times larger , respectively .",
    "not surprisingly , the mean internal uncertainty , @xmath38__unc__@xmath9 , of the morphed velocities is larger than the internal errors produced by the observed templates .",
    "this is likely the result of small differences between the morphed dst and the true stellar spectrum , which are not adequately accounted for by eqn .",
    "[ morph_model ] .",

    "figure  [ longterm ] shows a similar comparison for the 14 stars with @xmath40 years of observations spanning more than five separate observing runs .",
    "a comparison of the mean velocity scatter shows that morphed templates perform within a factor of 2 of observed templates , with a typical precision of @xmath41  within a single observing run and a long  term precision of @xmath33  .",
    "it should be cautioned that figures  [ shortterm ] and  [ longterm ] do not represent unbiased tests of the absolute precision attainable with the b96 technique .",

    "refer to the spread of the @xmath100 measurements around the mean values of the data sets .",
    "all standard deviations are consistent with the constancy of the host stars and their comparison stars",
    ". periodogram analyses of the two data sets do not reveal any significant periodicities .",
    "we computed the semi - amplitudes of the light curves ( column  5 ) with least - squares sine fits of the observations phased to the radial velocity periods .",
    "the resulting amplitudes are both 0.0004 mag or below ; this absence of light variability on the radial velocity periods supports planetary - reflex motion as the cause of the radial velocity variations in both stars .",
    "although we have no photometry of hd  33283 , it is the most inactive of the three stars ( table  [ stars ] ) and so should show a similar lack of photometric variability .",
    "the sixth column of table  [ photres ] gives the geometric probability of transits for the three systems we observed photometrically , computed from equation 1 of @xcite and assuming random orbital inclinations .",
    "the final column gives the results of our search for planetary transits of the two companions as shown in figures [ lc1 ] and [ lc2 ] and discussed below .",
    "the top panel in each of figures  [ lc1 ] and [ lc2 ] plots the complete photometric data set for each star against the planetary orbital phase , computed from the orbital elements in tables  [ param86081 ] and [ paramothers ] ; zero phase in each case refers to a time of inferior conjunction ( mid  transit ) .",
    "the solid curve in each panel approximates the predicted transit light curve , assuming a planetary orbital inclination of 90(central transits ) .",
    "the out  of  transit light level corresponds to the mean brightness of the observations .",
    "the transit durations are calculated from the orbital elements , while the transit depths are derived from the estimated stellar radii ( table  1 ) and planetary radii computed with the models of @xcite .",
    "the bottom panel of each figure shows the observations around the predicted time of mid transit replotted with an expanded scale on the abscissa .",
    "the horizontal error bar below each predicted transit curve represents the approximate @xmath101 uncertainty in the time of mid transit , based on monte carlo simulations and the uncertainties in the orbital elements .",
    "the vertical error bar represents the precision of the measurements in each case .",
    "our photometric observations of hd  86081 cover the predicted transit window quite well .",
    "the 21 observations within the transit window in the bottom panel of figure  [ lc1 ] have a mean brightness level of 1.3003 @xmath102 0.0004 mag .",
    "the 114 observations outside the transit window have a mean of 1.2993 @xmath102 0.0002 mag .",
    "thus , the two values agree to within 0.001 mag , or @xmath103 , placing very shallow limits on possible transits . in the case of hd  224693 ,",
    "our data around the predicted time of transit are far to sparse to rule out possible transits at this time ( figure  [ lc2 ] ) and we are continuing to monitor this star .",
    "we have presented a modification to the b96 precision radial velocity technique that eliminates the need to obtain template observations for each target star .",
    "we replace observed templates with synthetic versions derived by modifying the deconvolved stellar template ( dst ) of a star with similar characteristics as the target star .",
    "the depths and widths of the spectral lines in the surrogate dst are modified until , when multiplied by an iodine template and convolved with a model of the spectrometer psf , a fit to the target star s observed star  plus  iodine spectrum is obtained . based on our tests of keck / hires spectra of a set of chromospherically inactive stars",
    ", we have determined that morphed templates yield velocity measurements with precision within a factor of two of those produced by observed templates ; with a short  term precision of @xmath41  and long  term stability within 5  .    while observed templates yield the highest velocity precision , the observational time savings afforded by morphed dsts make them favorable alternatives for many types of planet search programs .",
    "examples include surveys containing evolved stars such as k giants , where stellar jitter is the dominant noise source @xcite ; surveys conducted on small telescopes where it is not possible to obtain high enough signal  to  noise for template observations ; testing for binarity among sim grid star candidates @xcite ; and surveys containing faint stars such as m dwarfs .",
    "morphed templates are also ideal for the `` next 2000 stars '' ( n2k ) planet search , which uses a quick  look observing strategy to efficiently search for short  period planets within a large sample of stars ( paper i ) .",
    "synthetic templates are an integral part of the n2k observing strategy and have already yielded important results .",
    "we report here the discovery of three new planets from the keck n2k program : a  planet in a  d orbit around hd  86081 ; a saturn  mass planet in an eccentric ,  d orbit around hd  33283 ; and a jovian  mass planet with a circular ,  d orbit around hd  224693 .",
    "the quick  look strategy used by the n2k consortium involves observing stars during three consecutive nights , and monte carlo simulations have shown that the strategy is most sensitive to planets with  @xmath104  and periods between 1.2 and 14 days ( paper i ) .",
    "however , the planets orbiting hd  33283 and hd  224693 have orbital periods significantly longer than 14 days .",
    "these detections were aided by the fact that intensive follow  up observations were not initiated until after the fourth or fifth observations were obtained .",
    "these two cases serve as important illustrations of how the sensitivity of the n2k quick  look observing strategy can be greatly enhanced with additional observations and an increased time baseline .    the  d orbital period of hd  86081b bridges the gap between the 3 day pile ",
    "up seen in the period distribution of hot jupiters ( hj , @xmath105  d ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) discovered by rv surveys , and the extremely short period ( @xmath106  d ) planets found by the optical gravitational lensing experiment planet transit search ( ogle ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while these `` very hot jupiters '' ( vhj ) are common amongst the ogle detections , comprising 3 out of 5 transit detections , doppler surveys have previously found only two other jovian  mass planets with a period significantly less than 3 days ( hd  73256 , @xmath107  d and hd  189733 , @xmath108  d * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter g05 ) showed that this apparent inconsistency between rv and transit searches can be reconciled by considering the different selection biases for the two search methods and the @xmath109 sensitivity scaling for ground  based transit searches . by accounting for these effects",
    ", g05 concluded that vhjs represent a rare class of exoplanet , with an occurrence rate only 10% that of hjs , based on the aggregate sample from rv and transit searches .",
    "since rv surveys such as the california & carnegie planet search ( ccps ) and n2k are complete down to saturn  mass planets with orbital periods less than 15 days ( @xmath110  ) , we can use the combined sample of planets from these two surveys to estimate the relative number of vhjs and hjs .",
    "out of @xmath111 total stars , these two rv surveys have yielded 16 hjs and two vhjs ( using a somewhat arbitrary lower cutoff at @xmath112  d and therefore including hd  83443 as done by g05 ) .",
    "thus , we estimate the ratio of hjs to vhjs is @xmath113 , which is in quantitative agreement with the estimates of g05 .",
    "a much more detailed analysis will be provided in a future publication in the n2k consortium series @xcite .",
    "the relative paucity of vhjs provides an interesting puzzle , and the answer is likely related to the way in which close  in giant planets are formed and how they interacted with their early circumstellar environments .",
    "one of the leading theories suggests that giant planets migrate inward along nearly circular orbits through interactions with their circumstellar disks .",
    "these interactions can take the form of gravitational scattering and physical collisions with planetesimals in the remnant disk @xcite , or through type i or ii orbital migration @xcite .",
    "these disk interaction scenarios predict very few high  mass planets ( @xmath114  ) at small semi ",
    "major axes due to mass  loss suffered from roche lobe overflow .",
    "this prediction is in accordance with the observed deficit of high  mass , short  period planets .",
    "there is another , very different theory for forming short  period giant planets . in this alternate scenario , planets with initially",
    "high eccentricity and small periastron passages become tidally circularized at small orbital separations . using the observed properties of extrasolar planets",
    ", @xcite showed that there exists a sharp cutoff in the mass  period distribution nearly equal to twice the roche limit , corresponding to the ideal circularization distance @xcite . if the original eccentricity is induced by planet ",
    "planet or planet  star interactions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , then the expectation is that there would be fewer high  mass hot jupiters due to their inertial resistance to scattering , similar to the migration scenario and also in agreement with the observed data .",
    "the roche limit scales inversely with planet ",
    "star mass ratio and proportionally with the planet radius .",
    "since the planet radius is nearly constant for @xmath115  , the tidal circularization theory helps explain the rarity of massive planets in extremely short  period orbits .",
    "indeed , the two most recently discovered vhjs , hd  189733b and hd  86081b , lie safely beyond the ideal circularization radius . however ,",
    "@xcite caution that the distance of the cutoff was derived under the assumption that the slope follows the roche limit since the slope can not be constrained by the current observational data .",
    "additional leverage can be gained by increasing the number of targets monitored in order to find rare high  mass planets close to the circularization limit , or increasing precision in order to find low  mass , short  period systems .",
    "this highlights the importance of programs like n2k that are specifically designed to efficiently search for short  period planets within a large sample of stars .",
