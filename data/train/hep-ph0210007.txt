    "the structure and dynamics of hadrons is known to be a difficult problem because the underlying qcd theory in terms of quark and gluon degrees of freedom is actually very complicated  @xcite .",
    "there are , however , well known situations where some helpful simplifications take place .    at high energies asymptotic freedom sets in , and",
    "perturbative qcd becomes applicable .",
    "the renormalization group equations allow , on the basis of the operator product expansion ( ope ) , to relate hadronic matrix elements of quark and gluon operators at different scales  @xcite .",
    "there are many situations where this scale dependence has been predicted and in some cases tested , particularly in the study of high energy inclusive  @xcite and exclusive processes  @xcite , but perturbative qcd says nothing about the value of these matrix elements at a given scale .    at very low energies ,",
    "spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking of the qcd lagrangian dominates , and the would - be goldstone bosons in the massless quark limit become the lightest states in the hadronic spectrum .",
    "they are naturally identified with the pion , and it can be shown that at low energies the interaction among pions becomes small . actually , at energies of the order of the pion mass , chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) can be applied , in terms of low energy constants which correspond to certain qcd green s functions , and many successful results have been found  @xcite .",
    "the values of the low energy constants can not be computed themselves from chpt .",
    "the previous considerations suggest the study of pion properties at high energies , be exclusive or inclusive processes , trying to exploit chiral symmetry . from a theoretical viewpoint ,",
    "@xmath1 mesons are particularly distinguished hadrons since most of their low energy properties follow the patterns dictated by chiral symmetry .",
    "actually , we do not expect to understand the properties of any hadron better than the pion , as chiral perturbation theory suggests .",
    "recent studies have shown , for instance , that chpt can be applied to compute chiral corrections of hadronic matrix elements involved in deep inelastic scattering  @xcite ( in much the same way as chiral corrections are computed for @xmath2 scattering ) .",
    "however , nothing is said on the value of those matrix elements in the chiral limit .",
    "the calculation of pion matrix elements of quark and gluon operators involved in high energy exclusive and inclusive processes requires some non - perturbative method . along these lectures it will be shown how this can be done with the help of low energy chiral quark models , which account for spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking , supplemented with qcd evolution equations , which automatically implement qcd logarithmic radiative corrections .",
    "chiral quark models share with qcd several features , mainly chiral symmetry ( realized in the goldstone phase ) and explicit quark degrees of freedom .",
    "as we will see below they are useful in that they can make quantitative predictions which , in many cases , agree rather well with experiment . unfortunately , there is not an unique model , but many and almost as many versions as authors working on the field .",
    "so , for practical reasons we will be using the nambu  jona - lasinio model  @xcite for quark degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that , when dealing with low energy properties of the pion , model details seem rather irrelevant , so most people have not paid particular attention to their different versions .",
    "this seems not to be the case for properties which are extracted from high energy inclusive and exclusive processes where the model details and/or their different versions turn out to produce quite different results .",
    "given the fact that qcd is a theory with quarks and gluons , one obvious question one should ask is what is the scale at which a ( chiral ) quark model is naturally defined taking into account that its only explicit degrees of freedom are quarks .",
    "so far , we only know of one possible quantitative answer  @xcite , namely the adequate scale is defined by requiring that quarks carry all momentum of the hadron . in a field",
    "theoretical chiral quark model this is a trivial statement , because there are no explicit gluons .",
    "this assumption seems consistent with qcd in perturbation theory since it turns out that the gluon contribution to the energy - momentum tensor becomes smaller as the running scale goes down until it eventually vanishes .",
    "the remaining quark contribution can be separated into sea ( flavor singlet ) and valence ( flavor non - singlet ) pieces .",
    "the precise value suggested by perturbative calculations is in the range , @xmath3 .",
    "of course , the separation of the gluon , sea - quark and valence - quark momentum fractions is a not a renormalization group invariant operation .",
    "thus , if such a matching procedure between qcd and the chiral quark is meaningful , it depends on the particular renormalization scheme .",
    "qcd is an asymptotically free theory , which means that the universal coupling constant among quarks and gluons becomes small as the renormalization scale goes to infinity , and hence perturbation theory becomes applicable . for definiteness , we use lo evolution for the running strong coupling constant  @xcite , @xmath4 with @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 being the number of active flavors , which we take equal to three .",
    "we take for concreteness @xmath8 , which for @xmath9 yields @xmath10  @xcite . in perturbative qcd calculations , @xmath11 is the expansion parameter .",
    "renormalization group invariance requires a very specific dependence for any set of observables , @xmath12 , on the scale @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a linear matrix operator , fulfilling cocycle properties typical of evolution equations , @xmath15 in the limit @xmath16 the operators are explicitly calculable in perturbation theory .",
    "obviously , conserved quantities do not depend on the evolution scale .",
    "a particularly interesting operator in qcd is the energy - momentum tensor @xmath17 , which due to poincare invariance is a conserved quantity and hence renormalization invariant .",
    "its matrix element between pion states fulfills , @xmath18 for the qcd lagrangian the energy momentum tensor can be separated into three contributions  @xcite , @xmath19 where @xmath20,@xmath21 and @xmath22 are the gluon , quark  singlet and quark non - singlet ( or valence ) contributions respectively fulfilling @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the gluon , sea quark and valence quark momentum fractions of the pion . in deep inelastic scattering ( dis )",
    "it can be shown  @xcite that if @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 represent the probability density of finding a quark , antiquark and gluon respectively with momentum fraction @xmath29 at the scale @xmath30 ( @xmath31 in dis ) then one has @xmath32 where , for @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "these momentum fractions depend on the scale , @xmath30 , and fulfill the momentum sum rule @xmath36 as a consequence of the energy - momentum tensor conservation . in perturbation theory",
    "it is verified that due to radiative corrections @xmath37 and @xmath38 decrease as the scale @xmath30 goes down .",
    "on the contrary , the non - singlet contribution to the energy momentum tensor evolves as @xmath39 where @xmath40 for @xmath41 .",
    "the value of @xmath25 has been extracted from the analysis of high energy experiments . in ref .  @xcite it was found that at @xmath42 valence quarks carry @xmath43 of the total momentum fraction in the pion , e.g. , for @xmath33 , @xmath44 downwards lo evolution yields that for a given reference scale , @xmath45 , @xmath46 the scale @xmath45 so defined is called the quark model point for obvious reasons . at",
    "lo the scale turns out to be @xmath47 this is admittedly a rather low scale , but one can still hope that the typical expansion parameter @xmath48 makes perturbation theory meaningful .",
    "since such an approach was first suggested  @xcite that is all one can do for the moment   and hence violate positivity of parton distribution functions as well as unitarity of structure functions  @xcite . ] .",
    "there are more sources of uncertainties to eq .",
    "( [ eq : mu0_dis ] ) .",
    "for instance , if the point for the quark model is defined by @xmath49 , then at lo the scale is @xmath50 . the determination of @xmath45 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : mu0_dis ] ) is model independent . in these lectures",
    "we will show how this determination not only leads to a successful description of non - singlet pionic parton distribution functions in certain versions of the chiral quark model , but also that the number is in quantitative agreement with other determinations .",
    "for the su(2 ) up and down quarks , chiral symmetry is the invariance of the qcd lagrangian under the transformations  @xcite , @xmath51 where @xmath52 represent dirac spinor fields with @xmath53 flavors and @xmath54 colors where @xmath55 are the isospin pauli matrices . as a consequence of this symmetry there exist baryon , vector and axial noether currents , @xmath56 respectively .",
    "conservation of the vector current ( cvc ) and partial conservation of the axial current ( pcac ) imply that @xmath57 with @xmath58 denoting the average current quark mass ( we neglect isospin breaking effects ) .",
    "a chiral quark model is any chirally invariant dynamical field theoretical model containing only explicit quark degrees of freedom and fulfilling the previous conservation laws  ( [ eq : cbc ] ) , ( [ eq : cvc ] ) and ( [ eq : pcac ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , there is no such a thing as _ the _ chiral quark model .",
    "this is probably the reason why there exists a proliferation of models with many variants .",
    "regardless of their differences all these models are characterized by the three ways of breaking chiral symmetry in qcd : explicit , spontaneous and anomalous .",
    "these are non trivial requirements , which imply constraints on the regularization methods in local models or equivalently on the high energy behavior of non - local models .",
    "in fact non - local models have been preferred because they provide a more natural explanation of the anomalous @xmath59 decay rate  @xcite , but the calculations are cumbersome .",
    "in addition , they are formulated in euclidean space and their extrapolation to compute matrix elements involved in high energy processes is subtle as it is on the lattice .",
    "for instance , the calculation of structure functions requires either a continuation of the non - local model to minkowki space or the determination of some moments in the euclidean region and subsequent distribution reconstruction .",
    "while the first possibility turns out to be extremely difficult to explore , the second alternative can not be used to pin down the @xmath60 which depends on the asymptotic behavior of the moments . on the contrary , local models , although less realistic , require specifying a suitable regularization which may be directly formulated in minkowski space .      for the purpose of our discussion",
    "we think it is useful to review the su(2 ) njl model  @xcite .",
    "this model has extensively been used in the past and there exist many reviews on the subject .",
    "so , although we aim at a self - contained discussion of pion properties , our presentation will be necessarily sketchy in order to provide the main ideas .",
    "nevertheless , we will stress those points where differences with other authors become important .",
    "the njl lagrangian in minkowski space is given by @xcite @xmath61 where @xmath52 is a dirac spinor field with @xmath62 colors and @xmath53 flavors , @xmath63 is the coupling constant with dimension @xmath64=m^{-2}$ ] and @xmath58 the average mass of the current up and down quarks @xmath65 at the scale @xmath66 . with the exception of the term in the current quark mass @xmath58 ,",
    "this lagrangian is invariant under the @xmath67 chiral group , with a @xmath68 subgroup .",
    "thus , the currents ( [ eq : bc ] ) , ( [ eq : vc ] ) and ( [ eq : ac ] ) , and their conservation laws ( [ eq : cbc ] ) , ( [ eq : cvc ] ) and ( [ eq : pcac ] ) are satisfied , as in qcd . a consequence of poincar invariance is the conservation of the energy momentum tensor , @xmath69 which only contains quark degrees of freedom .",
    "thus , we expect in this model that for any hadron , and in particular for the pion @xmath70 since the coupling constant , @xmath63 , has a negative energy dimension , the lagrangian ( [ eq : njl ] ) above is not renormalizable by power counting and it is usually interpreted as a theory with a finite cut - off , which we generically denote by @xmath71 .",
    "this means that results depend crucially on the value of @xmath71 and some fine tuning will be invoked .",
    "the need of a cut - off is not a serious problem from a physical point of view because we know that at high energies , much above the cut - off , the effective interaction should be replaced by the underlying qcd interactions in terms of explicit quarks and gluons . roughly speaking ,",
    "this feature is present in more sophisticated chiral quark models with non - local interactions .",
    "the real problem derived from the high - energy suppression has to do with the fact that we want to preserve the symmetries of the lagrangian , namely gauge and chiral symmetry , without removing the cut - off by taking the limit @xmath72 , i.e. keeping the high energy suppression .",
    "this implies that not every regularization , although it may accommodate some particular prejudices , may be considered as suitable .",
    "this point will be illustrated below . a full discussion on regularization methods in the njl model can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in these lectures",
    "we will work , as usual , in the one - quark loop approximation .",
    "this is equivalent to work to leading order in the large @xmath73 expansion , taking @xmath74constant . in this way",
    "we comply not only with chiral symmetry constraints , but also with large @xmath54 requirements .",
    "the study of higher orders in a @xmath75 expansion can be traced from refs .",
    "@xcite .      in a cut - off theory most of the discussion",
    "is related to the regularization , and hence gets a bit technical .",
    "we will use throughout these lectures the time honored pauli - villars ( pv ) regularization method  @xcite which has already been used for several applications in the njl model , like chpt  @xcite , finite temperature  @xcite , solitons  @xcite , structure functions  @xcite , correlation functions  @xcite and distribution amplitudes  @xcite . to our knowledge",
    "this is the most reliable regularization method of the njl model so far fulfilling many desirable features , among others preserving gauge invariance and working directly in minkowski space ( see the recent discussion in ref .",
    "the only difference with the standard pv method of qed is that in the njl model this type of regularization is applied at the constituent quark mass level ( see below ) .",
    "it is surprising that given the advantages of the method , it has been used so few times as compared with other methods such as euclidean @xmath76 cut - off or schwinger s proper - time .",
    "a potential disadvantage of the method is that it provides a negative spectral strength due to the pv subtractions , and thus positivity of some physical quantities , like form factors or distribution functions might not be fulfilled .",
    "although this is not exclude , in all the calculations we present we explicitly see that is not the case .    in the njl model",
    "this method has been used mainly within the context of the bosonization or auxiliary field method ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) , but at the one loop level and for the processes we will be considering it corresponds to making the replacement under the momentum integral @xmath77 @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the same suitable coefficients for all one loop graphs , fulfilling @xmath80 and @xmath81 and chosen in such a way as to make one loop integrals finite . in the graphs with an odd number of dirac @xmath82",
    "s the regulator has to be removed at the end of the calculation .    in the njl there appear quadratic and logarithmic ultraviolet divergences . to illustrate the method",
    "let us consider the integral @xmath83 which is quadratically ultraviolet divergent , as can be seen by integrating first over @xmath84 component ( using feynman s @xmath85 prescription ) and then over the @xmath86 component . using the pv subtractions , it becomes @xmath87 evaluating the integral by any method , one sees that at least the following two conditions are required to render the one loop feynman integrals finite @xmath88 thus , at least two subtractions are needed .",
    "solving the system of equations in terms of @xmath89 and @xmath90 provides two unknown parameters . to reduce them to only one the coincidence limit @xmath91",
    "is taken yielding the rule @xmath92 this calculation already illustrates a very general feature of the pv method , calculations may directly be done in minkowski space , and there is no need to go to euclidean space . this is a computational advantage in the study of high energy processes as we will see below . to simplify the notation",
    "we will implicitly assume the use of such a regulator in what follows .      to illustrate the method",
    "let us consider the dyson - schwinger equation for the quark propagator , @xmath93 , ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dyson ] ) .",
    "@xmath94 s_0 ( p)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath93 and @xmath95 are the full and free quark propagators respectively .",
    "@xmath63 is the four - point kernel , which in the lowest order approximation becomes the coupling constant and can be taken out of the integral .",
    "thus the full propagator acquires a constant self - energy , @xmath96 . computing the dirac , flavor and color traces",
    "one gets the so - called gap equation in the convenient form @xmath97 where eq .",
    "( [ eq : i_pv ] ) is understood for the integral @xmath98 . for @xmath99",
    "there are two solutions ( the wigner alternative )    * wigner phase . corresponding to @xmath100 . *",
    "goldstone phase .",

    "the gap equation is eq .",
    "( [ eq : gap ] ) and one has to choose the solution which goes to eq .",

    "( [ eq : mu0_dis ] ) we get an enhancement factor @xmath111 and hence , @xmath112 according to our point of view it is this value the one that should be compared to the model calculation , and not to the one at @xmath109 .",
    "of course , one may argue that lo evolution is not sufficient to go to such low scales .",
