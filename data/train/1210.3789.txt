    "with the next generation of large - volume proton - decay searches and neutrino experiments currently in the r&d phase ( in particular , lbne  @xcite , lena  @xcite and hyper - k @xcite ) there are good prospects to push the current lower bounds on the proton lifetime to the unprecedented level of @xmath2 years . on the theory side ,",
    "the new information may be , at least in principle , used for further testing of the grand unification paradigm ; however , this would require a very good grip on the proton lifetime predictions supplied by specific guts . unfortunately , the quality of the existing estimates is rather limited even in very simple scenarios , see figure  [ estimates ] , and it is namely due to the low accuracy of the leading - order methods used in most of the relevant calculations . on the other hand , consistent next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) proton lifetime estimates",
    "are parametrically more difficult : first , at the nlo level , the gut scale @xmath3 must be determined at two - loops ; this , however , requires a detailed understanding of the one - loop theory spectrum .",
    "second , the flavour structure of the relevant baryon - number - violating ( bnv ) currents must be constrained by the existing data to a maximum attainable degree .",
    "third , one has to account for several classes of almost irreducible uncertainties related to the planck - scale physics ( such as , e.g. , gravity smearing of the gauge unification pattern  @xcite ) which are often comparable to the nlo effects .     a simple illustration of the typical size of uncertainties in proton lifetime estimates obtained in some of the most popular su(5 ) and so(10 ) guts .",
    "rows [ a]-[d ] depict the results obtained in the georgi - glashow model and some of its simplest extensions @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ; in row [ e ] we quote the range given in @xcite ; in the susy case the [ f ] and [ h ] correspond to the estimates given in @xcite ; finally , [ g ] and [ i ] refer to studies @xcite and @xcite , respectively . for",
    "more information see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein.,width=264 ]    therefore , the only foreseeable way to overcome this conundrum is to focus on the simplest possible guts .",
    "in contrast to the minimal @xmath4 georgi - glashow model @xcite which was shown to be incompatible with the electroweak data already back in mid 1980 s , the history of the minimal @xmath0 guts is rather non - linear and even after almost 40 years it is still lively and evolving .",
    "interestingly , this can be partly attributed also to the fact that , in the @xmath0 context , the very meaning of minimality is not entirely agreed upon .",
    "this owes namely to the relatively large number of potentially viable symmetry breaking chains in @xmath0 characterized by different effective scenarios emerging at intermediate scales .",
    "let us recall that this is not the case in su(5 ) simply because there the need to preserve rank reduces the set of higgs representations available for the gut symmetry breaking to just few .    in a certain sense",
    ", this is not the case in supersymmetric theories either because the rigidity of the mssm gauge unification pattern calls for a single - step breaking where most of the details of the gut - scale dynamics remain obscured .",
    "thus , besides very special features like natural r - parity conservation etc .",
    ", the main distinctive characteristics of many models is namely their flavour structure .",
    "hence , with the spectacular failure  @xcite of the simplest potentially realistic renormalizable susy @xmath0  @xcite ( advocated by many to be even the very minimal susy gut  @xcite ) , and , in particular , with no signs of susy at the lhc so far , the community s attention naturally drifts back to non - supersymmetric guts .    in this review",
    ", we shall comment in brief on the status of the simplest non - susy @xmath0 scenarios and on the latest developments including , in particular , the new upper limits on the seesaw scale obtained recently in the work  @xcite and possible future prospects of accurate proton lifetime calculations in this scenario .",
    "the simplest multiplet that can consistently support spontaneous breaking of the @xmath0 gauge symmetry in the sm direction is the 45-dimensional adjoint representation .",
    "together with either the 16-dimensional spinor or the 126-dimensional self - dual part of the maximally antisymmetric tensor the models based on the combinations @xmath5 or @xmath6 are often regarded to as the minimal renormalizable realizations of the higgs mechanism in the @xmath0 guts . in this respect , it is important to recall that this is not the case in susy where the @xmath7-flatness conditions align the vev of @xmath8 along that of @xmath9 which , although providing the desired rank reduction , leaves a full su(5 ) as an unbroken subgroup .",
    "remarkably enough , in the non - supersymmetric higgs model based on @xmath5 or @xmath6 the su(5 ) trap can not be entirely avoided either .",
    "the point is that there are two states in the scalar spectrum of either of the two variants of the minimal model that can be simultaneously non - tachyonic only in a narrow region of the parameter space which , unfortunately , happens to support only su(5)-like symmetry - breaking chains .",
    "indeed , the masses of the color - octet and the @xmath10-triplet components of @xmath8 are at the tree level given by @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a coupling in the relevant scalar potential ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the two independent sm - compatible vevs in @xmath8 @xmath15 ( with @xmath16 denoting the second pauli matrix ) which , if hierarchical enough , break the @xmath0 gauge symmetry along two different symmetry breaking chains @xmath17 given that , it is clear that the right hand sides ( rhs ) of both equations in ( [ pgbmasses ] ) are positive if and only if @xmath18 , i.e. , when there is essentially no hierarchy between @xmath14 and @xmath13 , otherwise the corresponding vacuum is unstable . obviously , in such a case , @xmath19 is almost homogeneous and the descent is @xmath4-like ; this , however , conflicts with the gauge unification constraints as in the georgi - glashow model .      until recently , the argument above was taken as a no - go for any potential viability of the minimal @xmath0 model including the adjoint scalar as a higgs field responsible for the initial @xmath0 symmetry breakdown . however , as shown in @xcite this was premature because the hierarchy between @xmath13 and @xmath14 may be stabilized by quantum effects because loop corrections such as those diplayed in figure  [ loops ] provide non - negligible positive contributions to the rhs of eq .",

    "hence , for small - enough @xmath12 in  ( [ pgbmasses ] ) the two problematic states may have non - tachyonic masses even for a large hierarchy between @xmath14 and @xmath13 , thus avoiding the tree - level su(5 ) trap .",
    "let us also note that , up to the obvious differences in the @xmath24 factors , the same dynamical mechanism works in the @xmath6 higgs model .",
    "however , the vacuum stability was not the only issue that plagued the @xmath0 guts for years .",
    "the enormous progress in neutrino physics in the last two decades pinned the light neutrino masses into the sub - ev domain with the upper bound ( namely , from cosmology and double - beta - decay searches ) in the 1 ev ballpark . in the seesaw picture ,",
    "this typically translates into a lower bound on the scale of the underlying dynamics somewhere in the @xmath25 gev domain .",
    "this , however , was long ago claimed to be incompatible with the basic features of the symmetry - breaking pattern in the minimal so(10 ) models .      without any detailed information about the scalar spectrum of a theory under consideration ,",
    "the best one can do in order to study the relevant gauge coupling unification patterns is to employ the minimum survival hypothesis ( msh )  @xcite , i.e. , to assume that the components of the unified - theory multiplets cluster around the specific symmetry - breaking scales .",
    "as rough as this approximation sounds , it often gives a qualitatively good first look at the salient features of the unification pattern . in the non - susy @xmath0 framework ,",

    "this , however , implies that seesaw scale is far outside the @xmath35 gev domain favoured by the light neutrino masses unless the dirac neutrino mass terms are artificially suppressed . although there is nothing a - priori wrong about this option we shall not entertain it here .    rather than that",
    ", we shall attempt to do better than the naive estimates above by exploiting the main drawbacks of the minimum survival approach : first , the msh does not reflect many important features of realistic spectral patterns ( such as , e.g. , splitting among different components of multiplets below the relevant symmetry - breaking scales ) .",
    "second , it is totally ignorant of special regions of the parameter space where the scalar spectrum exhibits _ unexpected _ features such as , e.g. , accidentally light states deep in the desert .",
    "however , these are exactly the cases when the unification picture can be altered considerably .      beyond the minimum - survival approximation ,",
    "the only guiding principle left for an adventurous parameter - space explorer is the overall consistency of the theory .",
    "this has several basic aspects :    [ [ non - tachyonic - scalar - spectrum ] ] non - tachyonic scalar spectrum + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    first , all potentially interesting regions of the parameter space should support stable ( or at least metastable ) vacua . since the full - featured vacuum stability analysis is very difficult , we shall stick only to the necessary condition , i.e. , that there should be no tachyonic states in the scalar spectrum . let us point out that , for each such vacuum configuration at hand , one can obtain other viable settings by , e.g. , rescaling all dimensionful parameters in the scalar potential by a common factor .",
    "similarly , it is clear that fiddling around with the mass of an accidentally light state within a range well below the typical mass - scale of all other heavy states does not destabilize specific vacua either because such variations correspond to only very small shifts in the fundamental parameters of the theory .",
    "these two `` degrees of freedom '' can subsequently be used as an efficient tool for reducing the complexity of the numerical analysis of consistent unification patterns .",

    "we shall use this together with two assumed future limits that hyper - kamiokande ( hk )  @xcite may reach by 2025 and 2040 ( if built ) : @xmath37 furthermore , we shall for simplicity neglect all the details related to the flavour structure of the baryon - number - violating currents so that the numbers above translate directly to the bounds on the position of the gut scale . in the relevant plots ( namely , figures  [ figureremnants ] and [ figure2 ] ) , the points falling between these limits will be distinguished by a simple colour - code where the light grey is used for proton lifetimes between @xmath38 and @xmath39 years , dark grey corresponds to lifetimes between @xmath39 and @xmath40 years and black points yield more than @xmath40 years .",

    "actually , as we shall see , this is not a problem here because the accidentally light multiplets in all fully consistent cases originate in @xmath22 and , thus , couple directly to the sm matter fields through the same yukawa couplings that give rise to , e.g , right - handed neutrino masses .",

    "even though the minimal so(10 ) models have been recently revived as consistent quantum field theories free of inherent tachyonic instabilities , this beautiful and simple framework has never been rehabilitated as a potentially realistic and predictive gut scheme .",
    "this was namely due to the old studies of the relevant gauge unification patterns which revealed a generic tendency for the @xmath1 symmetry breaking scale to be confined below @xmath33 gev , apparently too low for a reasonable implementation of the seesaw mechanism for neutrino masses .",
    "however , all these early studies based on the minimal survival hypothesis suffer from a generic incapability to account for the effects of accidentally light multiplets with masses detached from any specific symmetry breaking scale .",
    "as we argued , a closer inspection of the unification constraints reveals a much wider room for the @xmath1 breaking vev stretching up to the @xmath46 gev ballpark which , in turn , allows the seesaw picture to be implemented without excessive fine - tuning .",
    "remarkably enough , the same pair of scalars that we identified as powerful `` running helpers '' in the minimal so(10 ) framework was recently singled out in the work @xcite from a totally different perspective . there",
    ", the apparent enhancement in the @xmath50 rate indicated by the current lhc data was shown to be attributable to just this couple of states if any of them falls into the vicinity of the tev scale . however , at the current level of accuracy only the octet @xmath41 can be light enough in the minimal @xmath0 to play any role in the higgs physics because the sextet is not allowed below about @xmath43  gev , see figure  [ figureremnants ] .",
    "nevertheless , the proton - decay limits used in cutting the low - mass - sextet region therein are rather naive and it can happen that a more - sophisticated analysis including flavour effects opens a bigger room for the light sextet too .",

    "this has to do with the general fragility of grand unification with respect to the planck - scale ( @xmath51 ) effects which , given the proximity of @xmath3 and @xmath51 , may not be entirely negligible .",
    "concerning their possible impact on , e.g. , proton lifetime estimates , the most important of these is namely the planck - scale induced violation of the canonical normalization of the heavy gauge fields  @xcite due to the higher - order corrections to the gauge kinetic form emerging already at the @xmath52 level : @xmath53/m_{pl}$ ] ; here @xmath54 is any scalar in the theory which can couple to a pair of adjoint representations of a specific gut symmetry group , i.e. , any field appearing in the symmetric part of the decomposition of their tensor product . for a gut - scale vev of @xmath54 ,",
    "this induces a percent - level effect which , after a suitable redefinition of the gauge fields , leads to similar - size shifts in the gut - scale matching conditions .",
    "such a `` unification smearing effect '' can , subsequently , play a significant role in an accurate nlo gut - scale determination which , in turn , further adds to the existing theoretical uncertainties in the absolute proton lifetime estimates .",

    "thus , the minimal @xmath0 scheme with the adjoint - driven higgs mechanism is uniquely robust with respect to this class of quantum gravity effects .",
    "this makes the symmetry - breaking analysis more reliable and , hence , admits in principle for a strong reduction of this type of theoretical uncertainties in the proton lifetime estimates .",
    "the simplicity of the minimal @xmath0 scenario advocated in this study , together with its rather unique robustness with respect to the planck - scale - induced unification smearing effects make this class of models particularly suitable for a possible next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) proton lifetime analysis .",
    "that , however , is far from trivial . to this end , let us just note that the main source of the large theoretical uncertainties in the existing proton lifetime estimates , cf .",
    "figure  [ estimates ] , is the inaccuracy of the gut - scale determination , partly due to the uncertainties in the low - energy inputs ( especially in @xmath58 ) and , in particular , the limited precision of the one - loop approach  given the logarithmic nature of the renormalization - group evolution , both these errors are exponentially amplified in the resulting proton decay amplitude .",
    "the only way to keep such uncertainties under control is thus a careful two - loop renormalization - group calculation including , as a prerequisite , the one - loop spectrum of the theory resulting from a dedicated analysis ( like , e.g. , that in @xcite ) together with the proper one - loop matching @xcite conditions . in this respect , the minimal renormalizable @xmath0 gut of our main concern here can be _ the _ scenario in which a decisive nlo proton lifetime analysis can be just at the verge of tractability .",
    "the option of a gut - scale baryogenesis in so(10 ) models , recently revived in @xcite , is another interesting feature of the model under consideration .",
    "on the technical side , however , the amount of thus generated baryon asymmetry depends on the size of the quartic coupling @xmath59 in the scalar potential , cf .",
    "formula ( 3 ) in reference  @xcite , which , unfortunately , turns out to be one of the most elusive of all the theory parameters  as it was argued in @xcite , @xmath59 does not enter the tree - level scalar spectrum and , so , the one - loop unification pattern does not impose any constraints on it .",
    "however , this coupling does take part in the decomposition of the light higgs boson in terms of its defining components in @xmath60 and , thus , it may be constrained indirectly by the flavour structure of the effective theory . hence , a dedicated proton lifetime analysis advocated above ( which , inevitably , must include a detailed account of the flavour structure of the model ) may , as one of its by - products , provide also a better grip on the gut - scale baryogenesis in the minimal @xmath0 gut .",
