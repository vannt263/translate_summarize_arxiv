    "different theories have been developed to explain the shock acceleration processes .",
    "the first theory is the shock drift acceleration ( sda ) @xcite , in which the energy increase @xmath1 satisfies @xmath2 with non - zero background magnetic field perpendicular to shock normal , where @xmath3 is the particle s displacement variance , and the drift electrostatic field in the shock frame @xmath4 is written as @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the background bulk velocity .",
    "if it is assumed that the background bulk velocity @xmath6 is parallel to the shock normal , the electrostatic field would lie in the shock plane .",
    "when a particle makes gyro - motion near the shock plane , part of its gyro - cycle is in upstream and the rest part is in downstream",
    ". the charged particle will undergo acceleration on one side and deceleration on the other while moving back and forth through the shock plane before leaving the shock due to the convection of the bulk plasma flow . however , the charged particle s net energy change during this process is an acceleration . in this scenario , if the particle s initial energy and gyro - radius are both too small , it will leave the shock very quickly and completely stay in the downstream because of convection .",
    "therefore , the sda has an injection problem that it is not effective if particle s initial energy is lower than a threshold value .",
    "the second theory is the diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) , or the first - order fermi acceleration @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that for each cycle of particles crossing of the shock plane , the mean acceleration time @xmath7 is @xmath8 and the average momentum change is @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 represent the diffusion coefficient and background bulk velocity , respectively , the subscripts @xmath12 and @xmath13 indicate variables in upstream and downstream , respectively , and @xmath14 is the particle s pitch angle cosine .",
    "note that @xmath15 in the first line of equation ( [ eqs : deltap ] ) is the statistical weighting factor . in this mechanism ,",
    "if there is non - zero background magnetic field parallel to the shock normal , a particle obtains energy during their reflecting between the upstream and downstream of a shock because of diffusion parallel to the background magnetic field .",
    "generally , dsa is not considered to have the injection problem .",
    "it is shown that with dsa the index of the energy spectrum @xmath16 satisfies @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the compression ratio across the shock .",
    "the third theory is the stochastic shock acceleration ( ssa ) with the magnetic turbulence or the second - order fermi acceleration @xcite .",
    "the driving force of the ssa is the stochastic electric field @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the turbulent magnetic field superimposed on the mean magnetic field @xmath21 .    with the great development of super computer s ability of computation ,",
    "different numerical simulation methods are proposed to better understand the acceleration processes .",
    "generally , energetic particles transport and acceleration in heliosphere can be studied by analyzing large amount of trajectories of particles which are obtained by solving the newton s equation of motion with em fields .",
    "if the em fields are assumed to model a shock , the particle trajectories method can be used to study the shock acceleration ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is known that numerical simulations with such method need lots of computation resource .",
    "if we are not interested in individual particle s movements , especially the details of gyro - motion , the fokker - planck transport equation of energetic particles can be used to describe the change of the distribution function @xcite . to study the shock acceleration of energetic particles",
    ", @xcite used the transport equation method , which is more computational effective .",
    "however , one has to assume the model of particle s diffusion that is not always established in reality .",
    "charged particles can be accelerated by a shock , on the other hand , shock accelerated particles would influence em fields , especially , they would excite shock waves . therefore",
    ", the particle acceleration and em fields evolution have to be coupled .",
    "hybrid simulation is a particle - in - cell - type model that treats electrons as a fluid without mass while treats ions kinetically @xcite . here ,",
    "in kinetic simulations maxwell s equations are solved self - consistently with plasma density and currents which themselves are generated from plasma particles @xcite . with conditions specially set",
    ", hybrid codes can be used to study particles acceleration and shock evolution self - consistently ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , hybrid codes are more complicated and require more programming effort , and the simulations need extensive computation resources . in order to pay more attention to the shock acceleration of energetic particles with specific shock conditions , e.g. , geometry , compression ratio , magnetic fields , shock speed , and magnetic turbulence models , with more statistics results but less resources needed , the test particle model , which does not include energetic particles feedback to the em fields , can be very useful .",
    "the diffusion of energetic particles in magnetic turbulence is very important to study shock acceleration of energetic particles .",
    "@xcite developed a classical quasi - linear theory ( qlt ) of energetic particle s diffusion in a slab model of magnetic turbulence .",
    "@xcite provided the nonlinear guiding center ( nlgc ) theory for the perpendicular diffusion coefficient .",
    "@xcite modified the nlgc theory for perpendicular diffusion to obtain a nonlinear parallel ( nlpa ) diffusion theory .",
    "it was shown that the solution of the nlgc and nlpa simultaneously agreed with simulations very well . furthermore ,",
    "@xcite fit the numerical results of the nlgc+nlpa model with polynomials , which is called nlgce - f . with the model nlgce - f",
    ", one can calculate parallel and perpendicular diffusion coefficients with much reduced calculations .    in sep events",
    "the energy spectrum of energetic particles usually shows a double power law or a power law with an exponential range in higher energy .",
    "the bend - over energy , @xmath22 , in such kind of spectra is often in the range of several to tens of mev per nucleon .",
    "the double power law energy spectrum can be written as @xcite @xmath23 } , & e\\leq e_b \\\\ f_0e^{-\\beta}e_b^{(\\beta-\\alpha)}\\exp{(\\alpha-\\beta ) } , & e \\geq e_b     \\end{array } \\right .",

    "it is interesting to study the origin of the double power law of sep spectra .",
    "some researchers suggested that the double power law spectrum can be caused by the shock acceleration of energetic particles ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but others assumed that it could originate from energetic particles transport in heliosphere    in this paper , we study the parallel shock acceleration of test particles by solving the newton - lorentz equation in the shock frame with pre - exist turbulent magnetic field . with large amount of trajectories of particles",
    "we get double power law with bend - over energy @xmath22 .",
    "we study the time variation of @xmath22 by comparing the simulation results with theoretical modling . in section 2 ,",
    "we show our simulation model . in section 3",
    ", we show the theoretical models of the bend - over energy . in section 4",
    ", we show the numerical results and the comparison with different models . in section 5 ,",
    "we show conclusions and discussions .",
    "test particle s motion in shock front frame is controlled by the newton - lorentz equation @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 are the particle s momentum , velocity , and electric charge , respectively , and @xmath4 and @xmath21 are the local electric field and magnetic field , respectively . from this equation , particle s trajectory can be obtained with numerical calculations .",
    "we simplify the shock as an infinite plane shown in figure [ fig : shock ] as the vertical thick line , @xmath30 represents the shock s normal direction and is anti - parallel to the @xmath31 axis .",
    "@xmath32 and @xmath33 are the upstream and downstream solar wind speed , respectively , which are both set to be parallel to the shock normal . @xmath34 and @xmath35 represent the mean magnetic fields in upstream and downstream of the shock , respectively . @xmath36 and",
    "@xmath37 indicate the shock normal angle relative to magnetic field in upstream and downstream , respectively .",
    "the irregular thin lines that change with respect to the averaged @xmath21 represent the turbulence magnetic field @xmath38 .    in this paper",
    ", we use a slab plus 2d model of static turbulent magnetic field @xcite , which is different from that in @xcite . in our work , magnetic field is written as @xmath39 where a cartesian coordinate system is adopted , and the @xmath40-axis is set to be parallel to the mean magnetic field @xmath41 , and the turbulent magnetic fluctuations @xmath38 have two components , the slab and 2d ones , @xmath42 here , both the slab and 2d components are perpendicular to @xmath41 .",
    "we neglect the induced electric field @xmath43 of the turbulent magnetic field @xmath44 in plasma frame because of the fact that @xmath45",
    ". therefore , there is no electric field in the plasma frame on each side of the shock plane , and in shock front frame the @xmath46 is the convective electric field because of the plasma bulk speed . in our simulations ,",
    "the turbulence has a kolmogorov s spectrum with a power index @xmath47 at high wave - number @xmath48 for each component .",
    "except that the shock compression ratio @xmath49 , the other background parameters are chosen as those in @xcite . in the upstream , the mean magnetic field is @xmath50 g , and the bulk velocity is @xmath51 .",
    "the correlation scale length of the slab component of the turbulent magnetic field is @xmath52 .",
    "the turbulent magnetic field @xmath53 is created with fft in a box with size @xmath54 along the mean magnetic field @xmath41 and number of grids @xmath55 .",
    "in addition , to be different from that in @xcite , we apply the 2d component magnetic turbulence , with correlation scale length of 2d component @xmath56 , in a box with size @xmath57 and number of grids @xmath58 .",
    "the energy ratio of the two components of turbulence is set to be @xmath59 . in the upstream , @xmath60 , while @xmath61 in the downstream . in the downstream side ,",
    "the bulk velocity @xmath62 and mean magnetic field @xmath35 are obtained from the rankine - hugoniot relations .",
    "since the average of turbulence magnetic field is zero and turbulence level is small , we do not consider the rankine - hugoniot relations for the magnetic turbulence fields in the downside of shock .",
    "we adopt a numerical code developed by @xcite using an adjustable time - step 4th order ronge - kutta method with accuracy of @xmath63 .",
    "40,000 protons with initial energy in the shock front frame @xmath64 kev and gyro - radius @xmath65 are injected with isotropic distribution in the upstream with a distance @xmath66 to the shock front .",
    "particles simulations are performed with total time @xmath67 , but without space limitation .",
    "it is interesting to study the evolution of the bend - over energy if we assume the seps are accelerated by a shock . with the dsa model @xcite for each cycle of particles crossing of the shock plane , from equations ( [ eqs : deltat ] ) for the mean acceleration time @xmath7 and equation ( [ eqs : deltap ] ) for the average momentum change one can get @xmath68 from equation ( [ eqs : dpdt ] )",
    ", we can see that the acceleration rate of particles by shocks depends on diffusion coefficient @xmath69 , so one gets different models of shock acceleration rate with different diffusion models .",
    "it can be assumed that diffusion coefficients @xmath69 can be written as @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are constants , and @xmath73 is the momentum of a proton with rigidity @xmath74 .    with the integration of equation ( [ eqs : dpdt ] ) , one can get the formula for the momentum @xmath75 of accelerated particles @xmath76 where @xmath77 , @xmath78 is particle s initial momentum , and the corresponding energy @xmath0 is @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the static energy of a proton .",
    "the equation ( [ eqs : ptimplicant ] ) is an implicant , by numerically solving which the momentum @xmath75 of particles with shock acceleration for time @xmath81 could be obtained .",
    "it is less possible for particles to be accelerated to energy higher than @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , the energy spectrum of particles accelerated by a shock could be turned around at the energy higher than @xmath0 , thus we can define a bend - over energy @xmath22 as a function of time @xmath81 @xmath82",
    "if @xmath83 , the equation ( [ eqs : ptimplicant ] ) could be solved directly as , @xmath84^{1/\\xi}. \\label{eqs : pt}\\ ] ]    since we study parallel shock acceleration in this work , diffusion coefficients in equation ( [ eqs : kappai ] ) are for parallel diffusion . for our new nonlinear diffusion theory (",
    "* nlgce - f theory ) , we firstly calculate a large amount of @xmath69 using the computer codes downloaded from the website http://www.qingang.org.cn/code/nlgce-f with different proton momentum in parameters both up- and down - stream , then we numerically fit @xmath69 data with equation ( [ eqs : kappai ] ) and get @xmath72 and @xmath71 both in upstream ( @xmath85 ) and down - stream ( @xmath86 ) . the fitting results are shown in table [ tbl-1 ] . from the table we can see that @xmath87 for nlgce - f model from the numerical fitting in the conditions of this work .",
    "in addition , for the qlt theory , @xmath72 and @xmath71 can be calculated analytically and shown in table [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "one can find that for qlt @xmath87 .",
    "therefore , the momentum of accelerated particles @xmath75 with qlt and nlgce - f theories can be calculated directly from equation ( [ eqs : pt ] ) , and the corresponding bend - over energy , which are indicated by @xmath88 and @xmath89 , respectively , could be obtained .    from @xcite , if charged particles are injected near the shock , after the shock acceleration for long enough time the energy spectrum becomes stable with power law index @xmath16 satisfying equation ( [ eqs : gamma ] ) . in this work , the compression ratio of the shock @xmath49 , then the theoretical power law index of the shock accelerated particles energy spectrum is @xmath90 .",
    "it can be assumed that the power law index model from equation ( [ eqs : gamma ] ) is for @xmath24 in the energy range lower than the bend - over energy @xmath22 .",
    "figure [ fig : traj ] shows the trajectory of one of the test particles accelerated by a parallel shock with @xmath91 as a function of time .",
    "the top one to three panels show the @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 components , respectively , of the particle s position in unit of @xmath95 , the correlation scale length of slab turbulence .",
    "the fourth to sixth panels show the @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 components , respectively , of the particle s momentum in unit of @xmath96 .",
    "the bottom panel indicates the energy of the particle in the unit of the particle s initial energy @xmath97 .",
    "the vertical blue dashed lines indicate the time when the particle crosses the shock plane .",
    "the red lines in the top six panels show zero in vertical axis .",
    "it is known that a particle will be accelerated and gain energy when it crosses the shock plane back and forth . from top three panels of figure",
    "[ fig : traj ] we can see that in the time interval @xmath98 ms ( noted as time interval @xmath99 ) the particle crosses the shock plane for many times , but at the time outside the time interval @xmath99 the particle does not cross the shock , especially after the time interval @xmath99 , the particle s @xmath94 component of position increases persistently with time and it moves far away from the shock plane .",
    "in addition , from the 4th to 6th panels of figure [ fig : traj ] , one can find that the particle generally perform gyro - rotation in the @xmath100 plane , while it is scattered back and forth near the shock plane in @xmath31 direction in the time interval @xmath99 , and moves away from the shock plane after the time interval @xmath99 .",
    "it can be seen that in the time interval @xmath99 , the crests of @xmath101 and @xmath102 increase much more significantly than the crests of @xmath103 , so it is shown that the energy gain is mainly in the gyro - rotation plane during the shock crossings . however , after the time interval @xmath99 , the crests of @xmath101 and @xmath103 do not increase anymore , but the magnitude of @xmath103 increases to the similar level of @xmath101 and @xmath103 .",
    "it is assumed that the energy homogenization among different directions are due to the pitch angle diffusion by magnetic turbulence . from the bottom panel of figure [ fig : traj ] ,",
    "the particle gains energy more than @xmath104 times of its original energy .",
    "but at the time outside the time interval @xmath99 , particle s energy keeps almost constant .    from the trajectories of test particle simulations ,",
    "we calculate particles energy spectra with different time , @xmath105 , with @xmath106 from @xmath12 to @xmath107 and @xmath108 ms . in figure [ fig : flux ] , the colored solid lines with diamonds show the particles energy spectra after the parallel shock acceleration for different time . for the simulation results from bottom to top",
    ", the time for simulation is increasing , however , the energy spectra from simulation results are multiplied by arbitrary factors for better view .",
    "note that we do not show energy spectra with energy less than the initial energy @xmath109 since in reality the background spectrum below @xmath109 is dominant . in figure",
    "[ fig : flux ] we can see , every energy spectrum can be divided into two power law energy ranges with different power indices , especially when particles are accelerated by the shock for a longer time .",
    "it also can be seen that the bend - over energy @xmath22 , at which the spectra would change from one power law range to another , is increasing with the increase of the time of shock acceleration .",
    "we would like to fit the power spectra from simulations with the double power law equation [ eqs : flux ] , however , since we do nt have spectrum in high energy range from simulations , for simplicity purpose , we ignore the exponential factor in equation [ eqs : flux ] , so the double power law equation [ eqs : flux ] becomes @xmath110 with different time of acceleration , we fit the power spectra from simulations with the double power law equation ( [ eqs : fluxb ] ) using the least square method in log - log space . in figure [ fig : flux ] , we show the fitted double power - law results with dotted black lines and the corresponding bend - over energy @xmath22 with colored filled circles .",
    "furthermore , we show the fitted bend - over energy @xmath111 with filled circles as a function of acceleration time in figure [ fig : ets ] .",
    "note that the error bars with @xmath112 and @xmath113 are obtained by modifying the fitted bend - over energy to a lower and higher values , @xmath112 and @xmath113 , respectively , to make the least - square - values @xmath114 higher than that with the best fitted ones @xmath22 . in figure",
    "[ fig : flux ] it is shown that as time increases , the bend - over energy also increases .    beside the results from simulations ,",
    "figure [ fig : ets ] also shows the theoretical bend - over energy @xmath89 ( solid line ) and @xmath88 ( dashed line ) with the diffusion coefficient models nlgce - f and qlt , respectively . in the figure , we find that both @xmath89 and @xmath88 follow the similar trend as @xmath111 does to increase as time , but @xmath89 has a better performance than @xmath88 to compare with simulations .",
    "in addition , with short time range , i.e. , @xmath115 ms , @xmath111 is larger than both @xmath89 and @xmath88 , but with long time range , i.e. , @xmath116 ms , @xmath111 agrees with @xmath89 much better . generally speaking , @xmath89 fit to the simulation results @xmath111 for the parallel shock acceleration much better than @xmath88 .",
    "figure [ fig : slope ] shows the time evolution of the power law indices , @xmath24 and @xmath117 , of simulated particle spectra in lower and higher energy ranges with solid and dashed lines , respectively .",
    "the dotted line indicates the theoretical results @xmath16 from equation ( [ eqs : gamma ] ) by @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the power law index of simulated particle spectrum in lower energy range @xmath24 is larger than the theoretical model @xmath16 , but it generally agrees with @xmath16 . in addition , as time increases , @xmath24 becomes smaller to get closer to @xmath16 .",
    "furthermore , one can find that the power law index of simulated particle spectrum in higher energy range @xmath25 is more than twice of @xmath16 , and @xmath25 increases as time goes on .",
    "hybrid codes are effective to study particles acceleration and shock evolution self - consistently .",
    "however , it is often interesting to study the shock acceleration of energetic particles with some pre - determined shock conditions , e.g. , geometry , compression ratio , magnetic fields , shock speed , and magnetic turbulence models , so it is useful to study shock acceleration by calculating test particles trajectories .",
    "in addition , since test particle simulations need much less computation resources , it is possible for us to study particles acceleration with more statistics , in larger computation space and time . in this paper",
    ", we study parallel shock acceleration with numerical simulations of large amount of test particles trajectories by solving the newton - lorentz equation with magnetic turbulence .",
    "the shock is simplified to be without thickness .",
    "in addition , we set static magnetic turbulence superimposed on the static background magnetic field .    from our simulations it is found that charged particles can be accelerated to a very high energy level , some particles can even get energy gain of hundreds of times of their initial energy in milliseconds . furthermore , the shock accelerated particles from simulations show a double power law spectrum .",
    "the power law index of the lower energy range approximately agrees with the power law index model by @xcite , but the power law index of the higher energy range is more than twice of the theoretical value by @xcite .",
    "it is also found that from simulations the bend - over energy , which is between the two energy ranges of the double power law spectrum , increases as time goes on .    with the mean acceleration time and the average momentum change during each cycle of particles crossing of the shock @xcite",
    ", we get the energy @xmath0 of shock accelerated particles as a function of time by the integration . in addition , we assume the bend - over energy is equal to @xmath0 since it is less possible for particles to be accelerated to energy higher than @xmath0 at any time .",
    "the theory of the bend - over energy depends on the diffusion model .",
    "we compare the bend - over energy from simulations with that from theoretical ones with qlt and nlgce - f models , and we find that the theoretical results generally agree with simulation ones .",
    "in addition , the theory with nlgce - f diffusion model performs better than that with qlt diffusion model .",
    "furthermore , as time goes on the theory with nlgce - f has better agreement with simulation results .",
    "this result is another way to show that the diffusion model of nlgce - f is more accurate than that of qlt @xcite .",
    "our results from both numerical simulations and theoretical models show that the parallel shock could introduce double power - law of energy spectrum of charged particles , with the increasing of bend - over energy as time goes on . beside the transport effects",
    ", shock acceleration provides another way to possibly explain the initiation of double power - law spectrum of seps in solar wind . in this work , because of the limit of computing resources , we do not simulate the shock acceleration for very long time , so that we do not obtain a power - law spectrum of energetic particles with the bend - over energy as large as that observed in solar wind . in the future , we plan to study shock acceleration with much longer time so that we might be able to obtain more realistic double power - law spectrum of energetic particles .",
