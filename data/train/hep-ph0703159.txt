    "there exists a rich phase structure of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , for instance , the deconfinement process from hadron gas to quark - gluon plasma and the transition from chiral symmetry breaking to the symmetry restoration@xcite at high temperature and/or baryon density , the color superconductivity at low temperature but high baryon density@xcite , and the pion superfluidity at low temperature but high isospin density@xcite . the physical motivation to study the qcd phase diagram",
    "is closely related to the investigation of the early universe , compact stars and relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "while the perturbation theory of qcd can well describe the properties of the new phases at high temperature and/or high density , the study on the phase transitions themselves at moderate temperature and density depends on lattice qcd calculation and effective models with qcd symmetries . while there is not yet precise lattice result for real qcd at finite baryon density due to the fermion sign problem@xcite , it is in principle no problem to do lattice simulation for two color qcd at finite baryon density@xcite and real qcd at finite isospin density@xcite .",
    "the qcd phase transitions at finite baryon and/or isospin chemical potential are also investigated in many low energy effective models , such as chiral perturbation theory@xcite , linear sigma model@xcite , nambu  jona - lasinio model@xcite , random matrix model@xcite , ladder qcd@xcite , strong coupling lattice qcd@xcite , and global color model@xcite .",
    "it is generally expected that there would exist a crossover from bose - einstein condensation(bec ) to bardeen - cooper - shriffer condensation(bcs ) for diquarks at finite baryon density and pions at finite isospin density . in the chemical potential region above but close to the critical value @xmath0 for diquark condensate in two color qcd or pion condensate in real qcd , since the deconfinement does not yet happen , the system should be in the bec state of diquarks or pions . on the other hand , at a sufficiently high chemical potential @xmath1 , the ground state of the system becomes a bcs superfluid where quark - quark or quark - antiquark cooper pairs are condensed .",
    "therefore , there should be a crossover from bec state to bcs state when the chemical potential or density increases .",
    "the bec - bcs crossover , which is a hot topic in and beyond condensed matter and ultracold fermion gas@xcite , was recently extended to relativistic fermion superfluid@xcite . in these studies ,",
    "the bec - bcs crossover is induced by increasing the attractive coupling among fermions . however",
    ", this is not the only way to trigger bec - bcs crossover . in this paper , we will study the bec - bcs crossover induced by density effect and chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "this density induced bec - bcs crossover is like the one found in nuclear matter@xcite and non - dilute fermi gas@xcite .",
    "the features of bec - bcs crossover have been widely discussed in condensed matter and ultracold fermion gas@xcite .",
    "we list here only the essential characteristics : + 1)there exist two important temperatures , one is the phase transition temperature @xmath2 for the superfluid at which the order parameter vanishes , and the other is the molecule dissociation temperature @xmath3 . in the bcs limit , there exists no stable molecule , and @xmath3 approaches to @xmath2 . in the bec limit ,",
    "all fermions form stable difermion molecules , and @xmath3 becomes much larger than @xmath2 .",
    "+ 2)the chemical potential is equal to the fermi energy of non - interacting fermion gas in the bcs limit but becomes negative in the bec region . in the bec limit",
    ", the absolute value of the chemical potential tends to be half of the molecular binding energy .",
    "this is true both near the critical temperature and in the superfluid ground state .",
    "+ 3)the fermion momentum distribution changes significantly when we go from the bcs to bec . in the bcs limit ,",
    "the distribution near the fermi surface is still very sharp and similar to the one in non - interacting fermion gas .",
    "however , it becomes very smooth in the whole momentum space in the bec limit .",
    "to be specific , we express the typical dispersion of fermion excitations in a superfluid as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the superfluid order parameter . in non - relativistic homogeneous system",
    ", we have @xmath6 . in the bcs case",
    ", we have @xmath7 , the minimum of the dispersion is located at nonzero momentum @xmath8 and the excitation gap is @xmath5 .",
    "however , when @xmath9 becomes negative in the bec region , the excitation gap becomes @xmath10 rather than @xmath5 itself , and the minimum of the dispersion is located at @xmath11 .",
    "this can be regarded as the definition of a bec - bcs crossover at zero temperature .",
    "how can we extend this definition to relativistic systems ?",
    "in relativistic case , we have @xmath12 . in comparison with the non - relativistic result , we should define a new chemical potential @xmath13 . for @xmath14",
    ", we have @xmath15 , the minimum of the dispersion is located at nonzero momentum @xmath16 and the excitation gap is @xmath5 . on the other hand , for @xmath17 ,",
    "@xmath18 becomes negative , the excitation gap becomes @xmath19 and the minimum of the dispersion is located at @xmath11 .",
    "this analysis indicates that the bec - bcs crossover in relativistic fermion gas is controlled by @xmath13 rather the chemical potential @xmath9 itself .",
    "an interesting phenomenon then arises : the bec - bcs crossover would happen when the fermion mass @xmath20 varies in the process of chiral symmetry restoration at finite temperature and density .",
    "the effective models at the hadron level can only describe the bec state of hadrons and diquarks@xcite , they can not describe the possible bec - bcs crossover when the chemical potential increases .",
    "one of the effective models that enables us to describe both quark and meson properties is the nambu  jona - lasinio(njl ) model@xcite applied to quarks@xcite . even though there is no confinement in the njl model , the chiral phase transition line@xcite in the temperature and baryon chemical potential ( @xmath21 ) plane calculated in the model is very close to the one obtained from lattice qcd .",
    "it is natural to extend the njl model to studing diquark condensation at finite baryon chemical potential and pion condensation at finite isospin chemical potential .",
    "while there is no reliable lattice result for real qcd with diquark condensation at finite baryon chemical potential , the calculation of diquark condensation in the njl model@xcite agrees well with the lattice simulation of two color qcd@xcite .",
    "also , the njl model calculation of pion superfluidity@xcite agrees well with the lattice simulation of real qcd at finite isospin chemical potential@xcite .",
    "it is natural to ask : how can such a model with quarks as elementary blocks describe the bec - bcs crossover of diquarks and pions ?",
    "in non - relativistic fermion gas , the microscopic model with four - fermion interaction can describe well the bec - bcs crossover at least at zero temperature@xcite .",
    "motivated by this fact , we believe that the njl model should describe well the bec - bcs crossover in qcd at finite density .    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ s2 ]",
    "we investigate the diquark bec - bcs crossover at finite baryon chemical potential in the njl model of two color qcd .",

    "however , for real qcd at finite baryon density , whether there exists a diquark bec - bcs crossover is still an open question , since the confinement in this case is quite important .",
    "an interesting and important phenomenon we found in this paper is that the bec - bcs crossover we discussed is not induced by simply increasing the coupling constant of the attractive interaction but by changing the corresponding charge number . during the change of the number density",
    ", the chiral symmetry restoration plays an important role in the study of bec - bcs crossover .",
    "when an chemical potential or fermion density mismatch between the two pairing species is turned on , the bec - bcs crossover will be dramatically changed .",
    "the system may go from some non - uniform phases such as loff in the bcs region to some uniform gapless phase in the bec region@xcite .",
