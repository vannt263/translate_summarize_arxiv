    "to accurately compute the free energy difference between two thermal equilibrium states ( @xmath2 ) is of interest in computational science and of importance in terms of drug discovery  @xcite .",
    "it can help us obtain a quantitative understanding of molecular complexes from atomic - scale , and also provide valuable information for use in structural refinement for drug design .",
    "generally speaking , to discuss chemical reaction , we have to determine the free energy change within so - called chemical accuracy ( @xmath6 1 kcal / mol ) , which is very challenging .",
    "popularly , several free energy calculations have been carried out within the framework of the thermal equilibrium approach .",
    "for instance , free energy perturbation ( fep )  @xcite and thermodynamic integration ( ti )  @xcite have been widely used to calculate the free energy change associated with the transformation of one ligand into another via thermodynamic cycles  @xcite .",
    "certainly , the recent improvement in these methods and the increase in computer resources have enabled us to calculate the absolute binding energy concerned with very small organic compounds  @xcite .",
    "however , equilibrium approaches involving most rigorous technique , known as the double decoupling method , require long time simulation to maintain the reversibility about the work associated with the decoupling process . as a more approximate method , the molecular mechanics poisson - boltzmann surface area ( mm - pbsa )",
    "analysis  @xcite has been a popular method to obtain absolute binding free energies within a reasonable time . in this approach ,",
    "explicit waters and mobile counter ions are treated by the continuum model after obtaining the molecular dynamics ( md ) trajectory .",
    "since the normal mode analysis is time - consuming , the contribution of solute entropy is often approximated based on the average of a few snapshots .",
    "on the other hand , in the nonequilibrium statistical approach , jarzynski recently derived a nonequilibrium work theorem that is valid in far from equilibrium regime  @xcite , although accurate numerical estimates of the exponential average , based on a finite number of sampled works , are relatively difficult  @xcite .",
    "shirts @xmath3 . proposed the acceptance ratio ( ar ) method  @xcite to estimate the free energy difference and also calculated the binding free energies for eight fkbp12-ligand complexes  @xcite using the `` folding@home '' system .",
    "furthermore , our previous work  @xcite suggested the efficiency of the use of general amber force field ( gaff )  @xcite for ligands to obtain the predictive binding estimates , and simultaneously indicated the importance of starting structures for simulations . in our method the use of many independent compute nodes or a grid computing system is effective to accelerate simulations , whereupon we also developed a massively parallel computing system , `` bioserver '' , consisting of 1920 microprocessor elements , to efficiently perform the binding free energy calculations .",
    "hereafter , our method is referred to as the massively parallel computation of absolute binding free energy with a well - equilibrated system ( mp - cafee ) .",
    "the principal aim of this study is to explore the practical feasibility of our methodology , based on a nonequilibrium approach .",
    "we have performed the calculation of the absolute binding free energy for theophylline and its analogs to the rna aptamer . on the same system , gouda @xmath3 . reported the results of free energy calculations using two different methods , ti and mm - pbsa  @xcite .",
    "therefore , this system is a good platform to compare the ability between two different methods , namely the equilibrium and nonequilibrium approach .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we initially describe the theoretical background and simulation protocol of binding free energy estimation used through this work , before subsequently explaining the choice of coupling constant @xmath1 intervals connecting two equilibrium states in sec .",
    "the results for all rna - ligands are presented and discussed in sec .",
    "iii . after pointing out the key features of this system , we conclude in sec .",
    "in general , the methods used to calculate the free energy difference in molecular simulations can be classified as either equilibrium or nonequilibrium approaches . several approaches based on thermal equilibrium , e.g. fep , ti and the potential of mean force using weighted histogram analysis method with umbrella sampling  @xcite ,",
    "have been attempted to compute the free energy difference between two equilibrium states .",
    "however , the equilibrium approaches encounter the difficulty of removing the nonequilibrium contributions , known as the hysteresis problem  @xcite . in order to overcome this difficulty ,",
    "a long time simulation must be performed , to retain the reversibility of quasistatic process associating with the thermal equilibrium .",
    "recently , jarzynski s equality exactly relates the free energy difference of two equilibrium states @xmath7 and @xmath8 to the statistics of works via a nonequilibrium , irreversible process that connects them as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the work change of a system from @xmath7 to @xmath8 under isothermal isobaric ( npt ) conditions  @xcite .",
    "a remarkable feature of jarzynski s equality is the fact that the switching time between two states is arbitrary .",
    "subsequently , when the process occurs instantaneously , the work can be defined by the potential energy difference as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the potential function and configurational coordinates , respectively . a coupling constant @xmath1 is imposed on the path connecting two states . the fluctuation theorem ( ft ) related with @xmath14 and @xmath15 of the work probability distributions along the non - equilibrium forward ( @xmath16 direction ) and",
    "reverse ( @xmath17 direction ) processes is derived by crooks  @xcite as @xmath18 $ ] .",
    "the ratio between @xmath19 and @xmath20 depends only the value of the free energy difference @xmath2 .",
    "shirts @xmath3 . pointed out that the maximum likelihood @xmath2 is given by ar analysis , namely , the control parameter in ar analysis must correspond to the free energy difference  @xcite .",
    "since two irreversible work distributions in forward and reverse directions cross at @xmath10= @xmath21 , both distributions must have a large overlap to obtain the free energy estimate with high accuracy .",
    "subsequently , after applying the multi - staging method , the intermediate stages are inserted onto the path between two states @xmath7 and @xmath8 , with the total free energy change obtained as the sum of the differences .",
    "this type of usage , involving the insertion of many intermediate states on the path connecting two states , seems to be effective .",
    "however , since economical issues also play a role because many @xmath1 require significant computing resources , we have now addressed the issue concerned with determining the adequate choice of each @xmath1 interval .",
    "first , potential energy is parameterized by @xmath1 , followed by the introduction of the @xmath1 dependency to the non - bonded interactions . in order to avoid instability near the end - points of the vanishing atoms through calculation ,",
    "the non - bonded interaction energy @xmath22 between the ligand and others , including the so - called soft - core potentials , is used  @xcite .",
    "we also use two kind of coupling constant @xmath1 for representing two different potential energies : the fully bound state ( @xmath23 ) and the unbound state ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "hereafter , the free energy component resulting from turning off the electrostatic potential ( @xmath25 ) is referred as the electrostatic contribution .",
    "we also denote the free energy component for the process of ( @xmath26 ) as the van der waals contribution .",
    "next , we investigate the convergence properties of the free energy when the number of equal @xmath1 spacings ( @xmath27 ) increases . a trajectory at each intermediate @xmath28 is obtained via the standard md simulation . as already noted ,",
    "the work associated with the forward path is obtained to compute the potential energy difference as @xmath29 . using a trajectory at @xmath30",
    ", the work on the reverse path is also obtained as @xmath31 , while the free energy @xmath32 can be estimated using both work distributions of @xmath33 and @xmath34 by the ar algorithm , thus the free energy difference is @xmath35 . in general , @xmath2 is being converged as the number of @xmath36 increases .",
    "@xmath37 is defined as a large enough number to obtain the well - converged value of @xmath2 ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "we also define @xmath39 . finally , to reproduce the feature of @xmath40 , the adequate mesh points of @xmath1 are determined to be satisfied with the following requirements : 1 ) the small difference between @xmath2 and @xmath41 ; 2 ) the small root mean square ( rms ) error between @xmath42 and @xmath40 .",
    "the rms error used here is defined as @xmath43^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "now , we have applied this manner to an rna - theophylline system . using the first 100 ps md simulation @xmath37",
    "were determined as 20 for electrostatic contribution and 40 for van der waals contribution respectively . as can be seen from table  [ tab : conv_lambda ]",
    ", we have determined the non - uniform mesh points of @xmath1 with @xmath2 difference ( @xmath44 ) @xmath45 0.05 kcal / mol and rms error of @xmath46 @xmath45 0.1",
    "kcal / mol , leading to a significant reduction in the number of necessary @xmath1 points .",
    "the @xmath1 points obtained were the following : 12 values of @xmath47 points ( 0 , 0.1 , 0.25 , 0.45 , 0.55 , 0.65 , 0.7 , 0.75 , 0.8 , 0.9 , 0.95 , 1 ) and 21 values of @xmath48 points ( 0 , 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.275 , 0.375 , 0.45 , 0.55 , 0.65 , 0.675 , 0.725 , 0.75 , 0.775 , 0.8 , 0.825 , 0.85 , 0.875 , 0.9 , 0.925 , 0.95 , 0.975 , 1 ) .",
    "computed @xmath49 as a function of @xmath28 were also shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : lambda_dependence](a ) and ( b ) .",
    "it is clear that the feature of the well - converged curves is reproduced well by a small number of non - uniform mesh points .    to estimate the free energy difference , the path from the bound state ( @xmath1= 0 ) to the unbound state ( @xmath1= 1 ) is chosen as follows ; the ligand electrostatic interactions with the environment",
    "are turned off , followed by its van der waals interactions with the environment , whereupon we obtain the solvation energy of ligand as @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "the free energy of the annihilation of the ligand from the ligand - receptor complex ( complexation free energy ) is also calculated as @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "we schematically note as follows ; @xmath54 on the calculation of the solvation free energy of the ligand ( l ) and @xmath55 on the calculation of the complexation free energy of the ligand ( l ) to the receptor ( r ) .",
    "consequently , we obtain the absolute binding free energy of the receptor - ligand complex as @xmath56 using the relation of @xmath57 .    in our study the three - dimensional structure of the rna - theophylline complex proposed by clore @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite ( pdb code 1o15 ) was used as a modeling .",
    "we assumed that the binding sites for six ligands fit into the structural framework of the original rna - theophylline structure because the structures of other complexes were not experimentally determined .",
    "all md simulations were performed using a modified version of the gromacs package ( v3.1.4 )  @xcite with single precision to speed up the execution .",
    "the amber force field parameters ( ff99 ) were used to describe the rna aptamer , including 1 - 4 interactions between hydrogen atoms , while the force field parameters for mg@xmath58 ions  @xcite were also used from the amber package .",
    "the atomic structure of the theophylline molecule was optimized in a vacuum using gaussian 98 ( gaussian , inc . ) with the hf/6 - 31g@xmath59 single - point energy calculation , while the atomic charges were calculated using the restrained electrostatic potential ( resp ) method  @xcite and the antechamber program was used to assign the gaff for each atom .",
    "the chemical structures of the ligands investigated here are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:6ligand_apbs ] , while the electrostatic potential surface of these molecules , computed using the adaptive poisson - boltzmann solver ( apbs ) package  @xcite after using the resp charge fitting are also shown .",
    "it is clear that hypoxanthine has a slightly different charge distribution around the lower left - hand side of the molecule as compared to other molecules . the tip3p model for water molecules",
    "was used to describe the solvent  @xcite .    through this study we obeyed the following parameters for all md simulations .",
    "integration of the equation of motion was performed using the leap - frog algorithm and all bonds were constrained by lincs  @xcite with order 8 .",
    "we used the time step of 2.0 fs while the non - bonded pair list of 1 nm was updated every 10 steps .",
    "all simulations were carried out at @xmath60= 298 k using the nose - hoover  @xcite temperature control and at 1 atm using the berendsen  @xcite pressure control respectively , with a time constant of 0.5 ps and a compressibility of 4.5@xmath6110@xmath62 bar@xmath63 .",
    "the particle mesh ewald ( pme )  @xcite summation was used to evaluate the electrostatic interactions with a grid spacing of approximately 0.12 nm , a cubic spline order of 4 and relative tolerance between long and short range energy of @xmath64 .",
    "the l - j interaction energy was calculated by a switched cutoff between 0.8 nm and 0.9 nm .",
    "we also included long range correction to the energy and pressure .",
    "we used the truncated octahedron box as a unit cell with periodic boundary conditions , while for the solvated ligand system , we adopted the unit cell size , maintained no closer than 0.85 nm from each face of the box , and introduced about 238 to 282 tip3p water molecules into the unit cell .",
    "rna - ligand complexes were prepared in which the minimum distance was 0.75 nm between the nearest unit cell wall on either side , while the number of tip3p water molecules used were either 7192 or 7193 .",
    "we introduced 3 mg@xmath58 ions into the complex according to the paper of gouda @xmath65  @xcite and also added 26 na@xmath66 counter - ions to the complex to neutralize the system .",
    "one of the difficulties for computing the binding free energy is the preparation of starting structure sampled from the canonical ensemble at the desired temperature @xmath60  @xcite .",
    "the following procedure was used .",
    "we performed energy minimization using the conjugate gradient method , followed by the md simulation of 20 ps relaxation with the solute positions restrained . in order to attain the thermal equilibrium state ( @xmath47=@xmath67= 0 ) ,",
    "10/15 ns md calculations were typically used for the solvated ligand and the rna - ligand complexes . through this process , used to conclude the system to be equilibrated , the total potential energy of the system and the local electrostatic and van der waals potential energies between rna and ligand were carefully monitored . via the multi - stage method we adopted an atomic structure at @xmath1= 0 after completing the preconditioning md simulation as a starting structure at each intermediate @xmath1 state . to decrease the uncertainty from statistical error , we sampled the md simulation with 15 and 10 kinds of different initial velocities for the solvated ligand system and rna - ligand complex , respectively .",
    "nonequilibrium works every 50 steps ( 0.1 ps ) were used to compute the free energies , which were obtained as the arithmetic average of all estimated values . through this work we simultaneously performed 330 ( 33 independent non - uniform @xmath1 points",
    "@xmath61 10 samples ) independent md simulations to generate the energetically possible samples for evaluating the binding free energy on the fujitsu bioserver system , consisting of 1920 fr - v microprocessors .",
    "it was found that a mg@xmath58 ion shielded by water molecules and located at the center of the u - turn formed by c22-u24  @xcite remained unchanged during all the preconditioning md simulations .",
    "conversely however , other mg@xmath58 ions immediately left their initial positions , and diffused around an rna aptamer .      a 15 ns preconditioning md simulation was used to reach a thermal stable structure in the rna - theophylline complex",
    "we now consider the energetically favorable structure from the perspective of both electrostatic interaction and that of van der waals .",
    "the obtained structure is consistent as expected , namely , the negative surface region of an rna strongly interacts with the positive region on a complementary molecule surface . besides , there is a match of theophylline and residue of a28 on the substrate .",
    "this result can be interpreted based on the view that the van der waals interaction simultaneously stabilizes the theophylline molecule onto the binding pocket .",
    "furthermore , theophylline is bound with an upper as well as lower layer .",
    "let us now move on to the binding free energy calculation to examine the availability of our method .",
    "the open circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : fe - tep - rna ] show the features of the convergence of ( a ) the solvation free energy of theophylline and of ( b ) the complexation free energy of theophylline to an rna as a function of the md step .",
    "each open circle was obtained by analyzing the generated works during each 100 ps md trajectory .",
    "rough convergence appears visible after 200 ps and 700 ps for ( a ) the solvated ligand and ( b ) the solvated rna - ligand complex , respectively .",
    "subsequently , we used work values from 200 ps to 1 ns ( 8000 samples ) to estimate the solvation energy @xmath50 and those from 700 ps to 1 ns ( 3000 samples ) to estimate the complexation energy @xmath52 , and obtained -14.4 kcal / mol for @xmath50 and -30.5 kcal / mol for @xmath52 .",
    "consequently , we also obtained the binding free energy @xmath2 of -16.1 kcal / mol for the rna - theophylline system .",
    "we have summarized the free energy components in table  [ tab : components ] and it can be found that the favorable structure of this complex is mainly driven by the van der waals interaction .",
    "we further comment on the computational cost required to obtain the converged @xmath2 .",
    "since the ratio of the simulation time between the solvation and complexation is relatively small , we only consider the simulation time for obtaining @xmath52 . in this system ,",
    "a total of 330 ns md simulations for obtaining @xmath68 were used .",
    "however , our approach is applicable for the use of many compute nodes to accelerate calculations , meaning the use of a parallel computing system , including a grid environment , is the key to diminishing the computation turnaround time .",
    "caffeine differs from theophylline by a single methyl group as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:6ligand_apbs ] .",
    "each component , once decomposed from estimated binding energies , was tabulated in table  [ tab : components ] .",
    "it is evident that the significant difference of 5.1 kcal / mol between the theophylline and caffeine bindings is mainly attributable to the electrostatic contribution ( 4.6 kcal / mol ) .",
    "we now address and attempt to explore the reason why the affinity between rna and caffeine is drastically reduced in comparison with that between rna and theophylline . due to the typical snapshots ,",
    "both ligands preferably bind within the pocket of an rna , as illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig : local_struct](a ) and ( b ) .",
    "hereafter , we discuss the results during 1ns md simulations after reaching thermal equilibrium states for both systems .",
    "the obtained averaged distances of tep(o)-c22(1h4 ) , tep(hn)-c22(n3 ) , tep(hn)-c22(o2 ) and tep(nc)-u24(h3 ) are 0.22 nm , 0.19 nm , 0.26 nm and 0.21 nm , respectively , while the averaged distance of caf(nc)-u24(h3 ) of 0.21 nm was also obtained for the rna - caffeine complex .",
    "these values indicated the creation of hydrogen bonds as the bond lengths were less than approximately 0.25 nm .",
    "this difference in the number of hydrogen bonds between both rna - caffeine and rna - theophylline complexes may result in a significant difference in the binding energy , so the number of hydrogen bonds for both systems were enumerated . at this point , we determined the hydrogen bond based on the cutoff angle of the donor - hydrogen - acceptor and the distance of the hydrogen - acceptor ; values of 60@xmath69 for cutoff angle and 0.25 nm for cutoff distance were used .",
    "we obtained hydrogen bonds of 4.3 ( @xmath701.0 ) for the solvated caffeine and the numerical value in parentheses indicated the standard deviation . on the other hand , the solvated theophylline has 5.4 ( @xmath701.1 ) hydrogen bonds .",
    "these results indicated a decrease in the hydrogen bond in solvated caffeine as compared to the solvated theophylline .",
    "the number of hydrogen bonds for the solvated rna - caffeine complex were 2.8 ( @xmath700.8 ) and 0.9 ( @xmath700.2 ) for caffeine - water and rna - caffeine pairs .",
    "we also counted the number of hydrogen bonds for the solvated rna - theophylline complex : 2.3 ( @xmath700.7 ) for theophylline - water and 3.1 ( @xmath700.6 ) for rna - theophylline .",
    "this value ( @xmath6 3 ) is easily understood as the hydrogen atom tep(hn ) are shared to be bound by both a nitrogen atom ( c22(n3 ) ) and an oxygen atom ( c22(o2 ) ) in the solvated rna - theophylline complex as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : local_struct](a ) , while these hydrogen bonds vanish in the solvated rna - caffeine complex in fig .",
    "[ fig : local_struct](b ) .",
    "the hydrogen bond contributing to binding energy for the rna - theophylline system is @xmath6 0 , while the decrease in the number of hydrogen bonds for the rna - caffeine system is @xmath6 0.6 .",
    "the contribution energies to binding free energies are roughly @xmath6 0 kcal / mol for the rna - theophylline system and @xmath6 3.6 kcal / mol for the rna - caffeine system , based on a presumed hydrogen bond energy of @xmath6 6 kcal / mol .",
    "therefore , the decrease in the hydrogen bonds represents the main reason for the significant difference in affinity between the rna - theophylline and rna - caffeine systems .      to obtain a thermal equilibrium binding structure",
    ", we similarly set the initial locations of other molecules in close proximity to the binding site of theophylline for preconditioning md simulations because the electrostatic potential surface of each molecule is almost the same as theophylline .",
    "the obtained stable atomic configurations of other molecules bound with rna were virtually unchanged .",
    "the association of rna with all six ligands is driven primarily by attractive van der waals interactions @xmath71 as tabulated in table  [ tab : components ] .",
    "the results of the absolute and relative binding free energies we obtained for six ligands are given in table  [ tab : fe_6ligands ] , which also tabulates the results of other methods , ti and mm - pbsa  @xcite and includes three important characteristics : 1 ) there is an effective linear relation ( slope= @xmath72 ) between the computed absolute binding free energies and experimental ones .",
    "we obtained the following relation between the computed relative energies @xmath73 and experimental ones @xmath74 for three different methods ( the results of ti and mm - pbsa were from ref .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath75 ( this work ) , @xmath76 ( ti ) , @xmath77 ( mm - pbsa ) , where @xmath78 is the correlation coefficient . consequently ,",
    "the efficiencies of both our method and the ti method for estimating the relative binding free energies are virtually comparable . here , we should point out that our method directly estimate the absolute binding energies , whereas the ti method only compute the relative binding energies .",
    "we also point out that the absolute binding free energy for the rna - hypoxanthine system is partly shifted about 1.5 kcal / mol from the linear relation , which means this result might suggest consideration be taken of another binding site for hypoxanthine binding .",
    "2 ) there is a constant energy shift of @xmath6 -7 kcal / mol from the experimental values @xmath79 as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : dg_plot_6molecules ] .",
    "detailed discussions for the latter are given below .",
    "in general , since water molecules play an important role in free energy calculation , we have performed calculations of @xmath80 as the sum of short - range electrostatic interaction energy and van der waals interaction energy between rna and ligand .",
    "the sample averaged values during 1 ns md simulations after reaching the thermal equilibrium state are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : potential - dg_expt ] . in comparison with fig .",
    "[ fig : dg_plot_6molecules ] , our method can reproduce the trend in both 1-methylxanthine and xanthine well , although the large shift ( @xmath81 2 kcal / mol ) from a linear relation between @xmath80 and @xmath82 was evident .",
    "consequently , our method evidently takes the effect of water molecules into consideration .",
    "the computed absolute binding free energies were approximately -7 kcal / mol smaller than those obtained by the experiment .",
    "how do we solve the puzzle underlying the difference between them ?",
    "we briefly comment on the presumed reasons to solve this puzzle .",
    "first , it is well known that nucleic acid , e.g. rna or dna , is generally flexible in solution  @xcite .",
    "there are a number of metastable states in free energy space and long term residence at a single valley , resulting in anomalously slow dynamics .",
    "namely , the ensemble average of several capable atomic structures was observed in the experiment .",
    "thus , in the rna - theophylline system we examined exploration of another metastable structure using a simulated annealing technique as follows : we first prepared a slightly expanded unit cell that was sufficient to treat the rna relaxing .",
    "theophylline and rna aptamer was solvated in a truncated octahedron box with 3 mg@xmath58 ions , 26 na@xmath66 counter - ions and 9325 tip3p water molecules .",
    "next , energy minimization and position restrained md simulation were carried out in the same manner , as described in ii .",
    "we also set a simulation temperature of 398 k to disturb the stable complex structure during the simulation time of 100 ps .",
    "consequently , a ( meta)stable atomic configuration was obtained by annealing to 298 k. one of the characteristic features was that a mg@xmath58 ion leave from the center of the u - turn of c22-u24 .",
    "binding free energy of -3.3 kcal / mol was obtained by ar analysis with simulation of up to 1 ns md , by discarding the first 400 ps runs , which is significantly small compared with the strongly binding structure described in sec .",
    "the feature of convergence of the free energy estimation as a function of the md step for this weakly binding structure was also drawn in fig .",
    "[ fig : fe - tep - rna ] .",
    "we further divide the binding free energy into electrostatic and van der waals components .",
    "binding free energy of -0.4 kcal / mol is contributed from the electrostatic part , whereas , -3.0 kcal / mol is contributed from the van der waals part .",
    "second , we examined the influence of the atomic charges of the ligand . here ,",
    "am1-bcc charges  @xcite of the ligand generated from mopac2002 were tested .",
    "@xmath50 of -17.7 kcal / mol was obtained , while @xmath52 of -33.7 kcal / mol was also obtained up to 1 ns md simulations .",
    "both values increased by @xmath6 3 kcal / mol as compared to those using resp charges ; hence we obtained binding energy of -15.9 kcal / mol , which is very close to the value of -16.1 kcal / mol using resp charges .",
    "third , the convergence of binding energy was explored .",
    "the solvation energy @xmath83 was reduced by approximately 0.5 kcal / mol as the cutoff radius was increased from 0.9 nm to 1 nm . the @xmath84 was also reduced by 0.2 kcal / mol as the cutoff radius increased from 0.9 nm to 1 nm , meaning the correction is substantially only 0.3 kcal / mol .",
    "fourth , we previously reported that @xmath6 3 kcal / mol energy shift from the experimental values is existed in fkbp12-ligand system  @xcite .",
    "then , several researchers have tried to solve this issue by different approaches  @xcite .",
    "currently , we believe that this energy shift can be interpreted by the difference of the force field used .",
    "the energy shift vanishes when we use the gaff for representing the potential of the protein to further improve the consistency .",
    "therefore , we examined computing the binding energy using gaff representing all atoms in the rna - theophylline system .",
    "@xmath85 of -14.2 kcal / mol was obtained , while @xmath68 of -27.0 kcal / mol was also obtained , so we obtained a free energy difference @xmath2 of -12.8 kcal / mol .",
    "this value still represents an approximate shift from the experimental values by 4.0 kcal / mol . finally ,",
    "since an rna has significant negative charges , we believe the fact that the charge polarizability of an atom is influenced by electrostatic interactions with its surrounding atoms , becomes important  @xcite . for this reason",
    "the polarizable potential model might be considered , however , as the computational cost rises significantly , we have not yet examined this ability .",
    "consequently , this puzzle remains a major challenge in the rna - ligand system .",
    "in conclusion , we have introduced the method ( mp - cafee ) as a highly accurate means of obtaining the absolute binding free energy .",
    "this method has been applied to investigate the properties of the rna - ligand system . since",
    "our method is suitable for the use of many compute nodes , we have also developed a massively parallel computing system to effectively accelerate simulations . to further reduce the computational cost , we determined the adequate non - uniform intervals of two coupling constants and consequently obtained the following details : first , our estimated absolute binding free energies correlate well in terms of a linear fit to the experimental values when all ligands are assumed to be preferable to bind the same binding pocket . by comparing the results of two other methods , ti and mm - pbsa@xcite , the accuracy of this method is almost comparable to that of ti in terms of relative binding free energy . with this in mind , we believe this method to be a promising tool to quantitatively predict the absolute binding free energy in the drug design domain .",
    "second , we expect a considerable difference in the binding affinity to rna between theophylline and caffeine to be attributed to the difference in hydrogen bonds of the related environment by analyzing the free energy component .",
    "finally , we find the constant energy of @xmath6 -7 kcal / mol shifted from the experimental values for all ligands on absolute binding free energy . though considering several presumable solutions to this problem , this area remains incompletely understood .",
