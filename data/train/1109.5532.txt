    "no such universal distribution has been formulated for irreversible processes .",
    "thus , to proceed to the solution of problems of statistical mechanics of nonequilibrium systems , it is necessary to resort to various approximate methods . during the last decades , a number of schemes have been concerned with a more general and consistent approach to transport theory  @xcite .",
    "this field is very active and there are many aspects to the problem  @xcite .",

    "the resistivity will be overestimated but it can still be a reasonable approximation .",
    "this line of reasoning leads to the ziman formula for the electrical resistivity @xmath66 here @xmath67 is the average magnitude of the fermi wave vector and @xmath68 is the free area of the fermi surface .",

    "@xcite that the formula for the electrical resistivity should not contains any electron - phonon enhancements in the electron density of states .",

    "the important relation which relates @xmath72 to @xmath73 at low and high temperatures is the wiedemann - franz law  @xcite . in simple metals and similar metallic systems , which have well - defined fermi surface it is possible to interpret all the transport coefficients mentioned above , the conductivity ( or resistivity ) , thermopower , magnetoresistance , and hall coefficient in terms of the rate of scattering of conduction electrons from initial to final states on the fermi surface .",
    "useful tool to describe this in an approximate way is the boltzmann transport equation , which , moreover usually simplified further by introducing a concept of a relaxation time . in the approach of this kind we are interested in low - rank velocity moments of the distribution function such as the current @xmath74 in the limit of weak fields one expects to find ohm law @xmath75 the validity of such a formulation of the ohm law was analyzed by bakshi and gross  @xcite .",
    "this approach was generalized and developed by many authors .",
    "the most popular kind of consideration starts from the linearized boltzmann equation which can be derived assuming weak scattering processes .",

    "it was shown that in the case of static impurities the exclusion principle for the electrons has no effect at all on the scattering term of the transport equation . in the case of scattering by phonons , where the electrons scatter inelastically ,",
    "the exclusion principle plays a very important role and the transport problem is more involved . on the other hand transport coefficients",
    "can be calculated by means of theory of the linear response such as the kubo formulae for the electrical conductivity .",
    "new consideration of the transport processes in solids which involve weak assumptions and easily generalizable methods are of interest because they increase our understanding of the validity of the equations and approximations used  @xcite .",

    "it was shown by many authors ( for comprehensive review see refs .",
    "@xcite ) that the suitable solutions to the liouville equation can be constructed and an expression for the corrections to local equilibrium in powers of the gradients of the local variables can be found as well .",
    "the generalized linear macroscopic transport equations can be derived by retaining the first term in the gradient expansion only . in principle , the expressions obtained in this way should depend upon the dynamics of all @xmath78 particles in the system and apply to any system , regardless of its density .",
    "the linear response theory was anticipated in many works ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for details ) on the theory of transport phenomena and nonequilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "the important contributions have been made by many authors . by solving the liouville equation to the first order in the external electric field , kubo  @xcite formulated an expression for the electric conductivity in microscopic terms . + he used linear response theory to give exact expressions for transport coefficients in terms of correlation functions for the equilibrium system .",

    "we believe that this technique can be applied to other model systems ( e.g. multi - band hubbard model , periodic anderson model , etc . ) . as it is seen , this treatment has some advantages in comparison with the standard methods of computing electrical conductivity within the boltzmann equation approach , namely , the very compact form . the physical picture of electron - electron and electron - phonon scattering processes in the interacting many - particle systems is clearly seen at every stage of calculations , which is not the case with the standard methods .",
    "this picture of interacting many - particle system on a lattice is far richer and gives more possibilities for the analysis of phenomena which can actually take place in real metallic systems .",
    "we believe that our approach offers a convenient way for approximate considerations of the resistivity of the correlated electron systems on a lattice .",
    "we believe that in view of the great difficulty of developing a first - principles microscopic theory of transport processes in solids , the present approach is a useful alternative for description the influence of electron - electron , electron - phonon and disorder scattering effects on the transport properties of transition metals and their disordered alloys .",
    "+ in the confines of a review of this nature many topics of great practical and theoretical interest have necessarily to be omitted ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in recent years",
    "the field of mesoscopic physics is developed rapidly  @xcite .",
    "it deals with systems under experimental conditions where several quantum length scales for electrons are comparable .",
    "the physics of transport processes in such systems is rich of quantum effects , which is typically characterized by interplay of quantum interference and many - body interactions .",
    "it would be of interest to generalize the present approach to quantum transport phenomena .",
    "+ in conclusion , the foregoing analysis suggests that the method of the generalized kinetic equations is an efficient and useful formalism for the studying of some selected transport processes in metallic systems .",

    "<S> this paper reviews some selected approaches to the description of transport properties , mainly electroconductivity , in crystalline and disordered metallic systems . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed qualitative theoretical formulation of the electron transport processes in metallic systems within a model approach is given . </S>",
    "<S> generalized kinetic equations which were derived by the method of the nonequilibrium statistical operator are used . </S>",
    "<S> tight - binding picture and modified tight - binding approximation ( mtba ) were used for describing the electron subsystem and the electron - lattice interaction correspondingly . </S>",
    "<S> the low- and high - temperature behavior of the resistivity was discussed in detail . </S>",
    "<S> the main objects of discussion are nonmagnetic ( or paramagnetic ) transition metals and their disordered alloys . </S>",
    "<S> the choice of topics and the emphasis on concepts and model approach makes it a good method for a better understanding of the electrical conductivity of the transition metals and their disordered binary substitutional alloys , but the formalism developed can be applied ( with suitable modification ) , in principle , to other systems . the approach we used and the results obtained complements the existent theories of the electrical conductivity in metallic systems . </S>",
    "<S> the present study extends the standard theoretical format and calculation procedures in the theories of electron transport in solids .    </S>",
