    "<S> a lattice boltzmann method ( lbm ) approach to the charney - hasegawa - mima ( chm ) model for adiabatic drift wave turbulence in magnetised plasmas , is implemented . </S>",

    "<S> expansion of the resulting lattice boltzmann model equations leads to cold - ion fluid continuity and momentum equations , which resemble chm dynamics under drift ordering . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting numerical solutions of standard test cases ( monopole propagation , stable drift modes and decaying turbulence ) are compared to results obtained by a conventional finite difference scheme that directly discretizes the chm equation . </S>",
