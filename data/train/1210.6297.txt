    "nonequilibrium phenomena in lattice are the oldest and most fundamental problems in solid state physics . in conventional solids ,",
    "acceleration due to external field is relatively small compared to electronic energy , and various scattering mechanisms make the transport diffusive enough so that the small field approximation has often been applicable .",
    "the quantum boltzmann method has been applied effectively  @xcite and linear response limit has been widely used in the solid - state literature .",
    "however , recent progress in nano - devices and optical lattice systems has made rigorous high - field formalism necessary to understand their non - perturbative effects such as the bloch oscillation .",
    "in such regime , understanding the interplay of non - perturbative field - effect and the many - body physics has emerged as one of the most pressing problems in nano - science .",
    "combining the nonequilibrium and quantum many - body effects is an extremely challenging task .",
    "much effort has been exerted towards understanding strong correlation physics in quantum dot physics , especially the prototypical nonequilibrium kondo problem .",
    "analytical theories @xcite and many numerical methods have been proposed along the time - dependent  @xcite , and steady - state simulations  @xcite . in such systems with localized interacting region ,",
    "the important question of energy dissipation could have been side - stepped , and the existence of steady - state has not been a major issue .    in the past few years",
    ", non - perturbative inclusion of electric - field and many - body effects in lattice systems has been one of the central issues in the field .",
    "theories for lattice nonequilibrium have been formulated  @xcite , mostly based on the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) for an @xmath0-orbital tight - binding ( tb ) lattice with on - site interaction  @xcite .",
    "various attempts have been made to include dissipation mechanism to the driven lattice by fermion bath  @xcite and bosonic baths  @xcite .",
    "this work corresponds to the analytic solution of the non - interacting limit of the models considered in refs .  .",
    "although a long - held belief in solid - state transport has been that , under a finite electric - field , the fermi sea is perturbatively shifted by drift velocity , many calculations performed under the dmft framework have suggested that the system approaches a steady - state with infinitely hot electron gas even for small field . with inclusion of proper dissipation mechanism ,",
    "one expects the boltzmann picture of displaced fermi surface at small fields and a recovery of the bloch oscillation in the high - field limit .",
    "however , it has been unclear so far what approximations , such as single - band approximation without landau - zener tunneling or the nature of on - site interaction , are responsible for the rather peculiar long - time states obtained from numerical theories .",
    "one of the goals of this paper is that we provide exact solutions to one of the simplest dissipation models with on - site fermion thermostats and give analytic understanding of the problem , and guide possible future modeling .    due to the nature of the one - body reservoirs",
    ", the problem can be solved exactly ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) . with identical reservoirs on each site ,",
    "the hamiltonian can be block - diagonalized according to the wave - vector of electrons in the transport direction .",
    "the block - diagonal hamiltonian can then be exactly solved by a time - dependent perturbation theory  @xcite using the nonequilibrium green function theory .",
    "the calculation of the wave - vector dependent occupation number supports the semi - classical boltzmann transport theory despite the lack of momentum scattering . dc electric current of this model is shown analytically to recover the familiar semi - classical boltzmann equation result  @xcite .",
    "based on these findings , we conclude that the fermion thermostat model , despite its crude modeling to realistic dissipation mechanism , can serve as a minimal setup for the studies of strong correlation effects in driven lattice models .",
    "although the model considered here is one - dimensional , the result can be readily extended to any spatial dimensions since the model is one - body and conserves momentum .",
    "we study a quadratic model of a one - dimensional @xmath0-orbital tight - binding model connected to fermionic reservoirs ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) under a uniform electric field @xmath1 .",
    "the effect of the electric field is absorbed in the temporal gauge as the peierls phase @xmath2 to the hopping integral  @xcite @xmath3 .",
    "the time - dependent hamiltonian then reads @xmath4 with @xmath5 as the ( spinless ) electron operator on the tight - binding chain on site @xmath6 , @xmath7 with the reservoir fermion states connected to the site @xmath6 with the continuum index @xmath8 along each reservoir chain .",
    "here we do not specify the explicit connectivity of the reservoir chains , but each chains are assumed to have an identical dispersion relation @xmath9 .",
    "notice that the electric field is applied only on the tight - binding chain @xmath10 .",
    "the coupling between the tb site and the reservoir is given by the identical tunneling parameter @xmath11 .",
    "the peierls phase @xmath12 is given as @xmath13 @xmath14 is the bloch - oscillation frequency due to the electric field .     under an electric field @xmath1 .",
    "each lattice site is connected to an identical fermionic bath of @xmath15 with the continuum index @xmath8 along the reservoir chain direction . ]",
    "we note that the whole system has discrete translational symmetry in the transport direction and the hamiltonian is readily block - diagonalized with respect to the wave - vector @xmath16 as @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( with lattice sites @xmath19 and the number of sites along the tb chain @xmath20 ) , @xmath21.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath22 is the tight - binding dispersion at zero @xmath1-field",

    "as the field @xmath69 increases , the @xmath16-occupation number to the fermi - dirac distribution shifted towards the field direction . despite the lack of momentum scattering in the system ,",
    "the picture of displaced fermi sea remains valid for small field .",
    "the fermion thermostats acting as particle reservoirs seem to dephase the peierls factor when an electron is absorbed in the reservoir , hence leading to the similar effect as the momentum scattering . in appendix",

    "the momentum shift @xmath71 , in the low - field limit , corresponds to the drift velocity which is proportional to the electric field @xmath1 and the lifetime @xmath72 of the transport electron given by the reservoir .",

    "it is also interesting to note that a similar formula has been derived for a super - lattice system with ohmic scattering within the semi - classical boltzmann transport equation  @xcite .",
    "although the current has the same dependence on the damping and the electric field , it should be emphasized that the two models have quite different scattering mechanism where in the boltzmann approach  @xcite the momentum relaxation is explicitly built - in while in our case the lattice wave - vector scattering does not happen and a very different fermi surface structure results",
