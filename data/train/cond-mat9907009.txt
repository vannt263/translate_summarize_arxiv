    "recent development in the cooling and trapping technique of atoms and the following success in achieving the bose - einstein condensation of alkali atoms@xcite have now opened up a new era in the progress in quantum physics .",
    "while the condensed system serves as a testing ground for a research in fundamental problems of quantum mechanics , it also offers a new example of finite quantum many - body systems such as hadrons , nuclei and microclusters .",
    "an important characteristic of the trapped alkali atoms is that it is a dilute system of weakly interacting particles and an ideal place to test genuine properties of condensed systems predicted by theories .",
    "along with a further progress in the study of bose - einstein condensed systems , a similar technique is being extended to create a degenerate gas of fermionic atoms , where a number of theoretical studies have been made@xcite .",
    "to realize such a degenerate fermionic system that requires a still lower temperature than bose systems , the technique of sympathetic cooling has been investigated@xcite : the cooling mechanism through the collisions with coexisting cold bose particles in a polarized boson - fermion mixture , where the fermion - fermion interaction is less effective .",
    "the mixture of bose and fermi particles is itself an interesting system for a study : the hydrogen - deuterium system has been studied already at the early stage of these investigations@xcite .",
    "recently , theoretical studies have been made for the trapped boson - fermion system of alkali atoms and proposed many interesting properties : the exotic density configurations through the repulsive or attractive boson - fermion interactions @xcite , the decaying processes after the removal of the confining trap @xcite , and the metastability of the @xmath1li-@xmath2li mixture @xcite .    in this paper , we study static properties of a mixed bose - fermi system of trapped potassium atoms , where one fermionic ( @xmath3k ) and two bosonic isotopes ( @xmath4k and @xmath5k ) are known as candidates for a realization of such a degenerate quantum system .",
    "trapping of the fermionic isotope @xmath3k has already been reported@xcite .",
    "these isotopes are also of an interest since the boson - fermion interaction may be repulsive or attractive depending on their choice@xcite .",
    "below we first describe a set of equations for the mixed system at @xmath6 , where the bosonic part is given by a gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation and including boson - fermion interaction , and the fermionic part is by the thomas - fermi ( tf ) equation .",
    "the use of the gp equation allows one to study a system with a net attractive potential for bosons where the thomas - fermi - type ( tf ) approximation is not applicable .",
    "the applicability of these equations for the trapped potassium system was discussed in @xcite .    in sec .",
    "iii , we discuss qualitative properties of solutions from the gp and tf equations analytically ; especially , their dependence on the boson / fermion number is estimated .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , general features of solution including a deformed system is discussed in the repulsive boson - fermion interaction . on the other hand , to study more realistic system , we concentrate on the specific systems of potassium isotopes , i.e.,@xmath4k-@xmath3k system and @xmath5k-@xmath3k system using empirically derived atomic interactions .",
    "we also consider the effect of changing parameters of the trapped potential .",
    "finally , we mention the possibility of trapping fermions only through the attractive interactions by the trapped bose particles .",
    "we consider a spin - polarized system of bosons and fermions at @xmath6 described by a hamiltonian @xmath7 :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively denote boson and fermion field operators with masses @xmath11 and @xmath12 . because of diluteness",

    "the fermion - fermion interaction has been neglected because of diluteness and particle polarization .",

    "the fermion wave function is given by a slater determinant ; the single - particle states are determined , e.g. , by the hartree - fock self - consistent equation . in the present approximation of neglecting fermion - fermion interactions",
    ", we only have to solve for the single particle states under the effective potential for fermions : the trapping potential and the boson - fermion interaction . in the actual calculation",
    ", we however adopt a semiclassical ( tf ) description for fermion density , which is known to provide a good approximation as far as the number of atoms is sufficiently large@xcite .",
    "we thus obtain a set of equations for @xmath31 and @xmath32 @xcite : @xmath33 \\phi(\\vec{r } )             = \\mu_b \\phi(\\vec{r } ) ,   \\label{gpeq}\\\\ %        & & \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2 m_f }            [ 6 \\pi^2 n_f(\\vec{r})]^{2/3 }             + \\frac{1}{2 } m_f \\omega_f^2 r^2            + h\\ , n_b(\\vec{r } ) = \\mu_f ,   \\label{fermieq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the boson and fermion densities are defined by @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",

    "if we neglect the boson - fermion interaction , we would obtain a much broader distribution for fermions as compared with that for bosons because of the exclusion principle . to see this",
    ", we consider a free boson / fermion system trapped in a harmonic oscillator potential .",
    "the mean square radius of each system is obtained from the virial theorem : @xmath36 where the harmonic - oscillator lengths @xmath37 are @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the total boson / fermion numbers .",

    "however , when @xmath73 , the boson - fermion interaction is not negligible , and the boson density profile can be quite different from that in non - interacting case ( @xmath74 ) .    in @xmath4k-@xmath3k system discussed in sec .",

    "it should be noticed that the parameters in ( [ eqf ] ) are in the same order when @xmath81 , and it means @xmath82 in that case .",

    "we next turn to the @xmath5k-@xmath3k system where the boson - fermion interaction is attractive .",
    "because of the large value of the strength , one may expect a sizable effect of the boson - fermion interaction for this system .",
    "moreover , the strong boson - boson interaction makes a stronger overlap of bosons and fermions and thus the attractive interaction are more efficient .",
    "so the system might be expected to be unstable against collapse . if the effect of the boson - fermion interaction is too strong",
    ". actually , @xmath142=(1000,1000 ) and ( 10000,1000 ) , we obtained a distribution as given in fig .  4 and table ii .",
    "the effect of the attraction on the fermions is larger than the @xmath4k-@xmath3k system , although it is not strong enough to cause an appreciable change in the boson distribution .",
    "the stability condition for the fermion collapse can be derived from the scaling law in refs .",
    "@xcite : @xmath150 in the present case , we obtain @xmath151 and @xmath152 , so that the stability condition ( [ eqm ] ) is well satisfied , and we have found the parameters of @xmath5k-@xmath3k system is in ( quasi ) stable region .    is the bosonic distribution always robust against a mixture of fermions ? aside from the possibility of changing the interaction strength via feshbach resonances@xcite , we have a possibility of enhancing the boson - fermion interaction effect using the different confining potential for bosons and fermions separately ( i.e. @xmath153 ) . fig .  5 shows the boson / fermion distribution for ( a ) @xmath4k-@xmath3k ( @xmath154 ) and ( b ) @xmath5k-@xmath3k ( @xmath155 ) : @xmath156 , @xmath157 . for a large value of the ratio @xmath158 , the fermions are trapped in a strong confining potential and thus have a large overlap with bosons ; the boson distribution ( solid lines ) is sensitive to the value of @xmath59 even though the bosonic parameters are fixed .",
    "this may be traced back to a rather large fraction of the boson - fermion interaction energy in the total boson energies : for the @xmath5k-@xmath3k system at @xmath159 , for instance , the ratio of the boson - fermion interaction energy to the total boson energy becomes @xmath160 @xcite , while it is less than 1 per cent to the total fermion energy .",
    "the change of the boson - density distribution can be estimated from the ratio @xmath0 in ( [ eqi ] ) . when @xmath62 , it becomes @xmath161 so that the boson - density distribution become more sensitive for large values of @xmath59 .",

    "( [ eql ] ) , estimations can be obtained for the boson - trapped fermion number : for @xmath136 , only 18 fermions are bound , while for @xmath168 more than 4000 fermions will be trapped within the bose condensate .",
    "this qualitative estimate is verified also in the numerical calculation for @xmath136 , although one should actually take the shell effect into account for such a small number of fermions@xcite .",
    "in the present paper , we studied static properties of a mixed system of bosons ( @xmath4k or @xmath5k ) and fermions ( @xmath3k ) in the trapping potential at temperature zero .",

    "the analytical estimations have been done generally for the rms radii of the boson / fermion distribution , the parameter - dependence of their profile and the phase separation , and we have found the feasible conditions for them .",
    "these analytical estimations have been applied to the numerical results for the potassium system and also compared with the discussion done in @xcite : consequently , the consistency was checked for these estimations .    for similar particle numbers and external potential parameters , the fermions have a much more extended distribution and larger energies than bosons because of the exclusion principle .",
    "we studied the effect of the boson - fermion interaction on the density distribution of both kinds of particles . for a repulsive interaction ,",
    "the fermions tend to be pushed out , but the effect is not very large for the parameters of @xmath5k-@xmath3k system adopted in the present paper . in the case of the attractive interaction ,",
    "a coherence of @xmath5k and @xmath3k occurs and is strongly enhanced if the trapping potential is adjusted so as to make them overlap .",
    "it was shown also that the fermions could be kept trapped without external potential due only to an attractive interaction with trapped bose particles .",
    "one may as well consider the opposite case where the bosons are trapped only via an attractive interaction with surrounding trapped fermi particles .",
