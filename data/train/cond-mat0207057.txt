    "the prospect of a semiconductor laser in the infrared and thz region has been one of the key reasons for the development and study of semiconductor heterostructure elements , since the first proposal of semiconductor superlattices in 1970 @xcite .",
    "a possible gain mechanism may be based on two different ideas : ( i ) at certain electrical fields resonant tunneling between different subbands can lead to population inversion associated with gain at the transition energy @xcite .",
    "this idea was realized in the quantum cascade laser @xcite , which has become an important device in the infrared region .",
    "lasing in the thz region has been demonstrated very recently as well @xcite .",
    "for further details , see the review @xcite .",
    "( ii ) the occurrence of negative differential conductivity in superlattices gives raise to gain in the low frequency range extending up to frequencies of the order of the bloch frequency @xcite . despite a strong effort by several groups all over the world , this idea is still not realized .",
    "the difficulty in its realization is attributed to the instability of the operating state leading to domain formation @xcite , which may be circumvented by different strategies @xcite . for further references and a detailed discussion",
    "see ref .  .",
    "these concepts for gain are commonly described in different ways : ( i ) an external electromagnetic field causes transitions between different levels , where the transition rate @xmath0 is evaluated by fermi s golden rule .",
    "if stimulated emission dominates stimulated absorption ( i.e. , for population inversion ) , gain occurs at the transition frequency . for a pair of states",
    "@xmath1 with energies @xmath2 , occupation probabilities @xmath3 , and a dipole matrix element @xmath4 , the contribution to the material gain ( i.e. , increase of light intensity per length ) is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the normalization volume , @xmath7 is the electron charge , @xmath8 is the vacuum speed of light , and @xmath9 the background dielectric constant .",
    "\\(ii ) transport theory in the presence of alternating electric fields provides the complex dynamical conductance @xmath10 .",
    "standard electrodynamics ( see , e.g. , section 7.5 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) gives the material gain ( the negative absorption coefficient @xmath11 , which is assumed to be small compared to the wave vector here ) @xmath12 thus , gain is equivalent to a negative differential conductivity in the respective frequency range .",

    ", gain may result both from optical transitions in the spirit of ( i ) and macroscopic currents in the spirit of ( ii ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to show the feasibility of a general approach based on a quantum transport theory which treats both mechanisms on a equal footing .",

    "while these works consider transitions between the conduction and valence band , the focus in this paper is on transitions within the conduction band in current - driven heterostructure devices .",
    "the calculations are performed in two steps : first the transport problem is solved by evaluating a self - consistent stationary solution of the quantum kinetic equations for a given applied bias .",
    "this provides us with the green functions describing the electronic state far from equilibrium . in a second step , an additional weak radiation field",
    "is taken into account .",
    "the time - dependent kinetic equations are linearized around the stationary nonequilibrium state in oder to study the linear response of the current - driven system .",
    "the formulation used here employs the full two - time structure of the theory without any sort of ( generalized ) kadanoff - baym ansatz @xcite .",
    "the capability of the approach is demonstrated by calculations of the gain spectra in a quantum cascade laser and a superlattice .",
