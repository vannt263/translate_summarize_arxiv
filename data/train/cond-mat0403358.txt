    "nanosized magnetic particles have received considerable attention in experimental , theoretical and computational solid state physics due to their rich and often unusual experimental behaviour .",
    "assemblies of these particles are a subject of intense research for many years and the investigations are still running with the new outcomes .    besides looking for new physics ,",
    "big part of the magnetic nanoparticles research receives impulsion from the profitable technological application of these new and complex materials , mainly in the magnetic data - storage ( memory ) and biotechnology ( drug delivery , self - assembly ) .",
    "today topics concerning the physics and magnetism of ultrafine magnetic particles are directed mainly to the coupling of neighbour particles @xcite , surface spin glass ordering @xcite , influence of the mechanical treating on the properties of fine magnetic particles @xcite , memory effects @xcite , collective phenomena @xcite and very famous quantum tunneling of magnetization @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to compare the properties and phenomena in materials of different chemical composition but in the form of the fine particles with similar sizes and having very similar crystal structure .",
    "the systems investigated in this work are the inverse spinel ferroxide nanoparticles of copper - ferrite with initial formula fe@xmath5fe@xmath6cu@xmath7$]o@xmath2 , where @xmath8 . their inverse spinel structure with two different crystallographic sublattices for the cations",
    "can be represented by a general formula a@xmath5b@xmath9$]o@xmath2 , where a belongs to the tetrahedral , and b to the octahedral sites . in cufe@xmath3o@xmath2",
    "the fe@xmath10 cations complete the a sites and half of the b sites , and the cu@xmath11 cation generally occupies the b sites @xcite and is a typical jahn - teller ion .",
    "the nanoparticles could be considered as a state of matter on the borderline between the atomic and crystalline states and it is important to investigate magnetic oxides with the similar chemical composition and low anisotropy , but with crystallographic deviations such as those occurring at the structural transition due to cooperative jahn - teller distortion .",
    "particles were obtained by soft chemical process : by applying a magnetic field during the co - precipitation process , we separated the particles with spherical shape and particle size up to ( 6.5@xmath41.5)nm .",
    "it is well known that the magnetic properties of the ferrospinels are very sensitive to the cation distribution .",
    "the compositions chosen offer the possibility to investigate the influence of the ions distribution in a spinel structure on the magnetization when the particle is spherical and single domain .",
    "thus , we investigated the influence of the phase and structural particularities of nanosized granular inverse spinels on the magnetization processes .    besides ferrimagnetic ordering , which originates from the strong exchange interaction between atoms , these materials exhibit also magnetic anisotropy , resulting from the relativistically small interaction between the atomic moments and crystal field @xcite .",
    "particles of actual size are preferably single domain @xcite , so that the magnetic state of the particle can be described by one unique quantity - it s magnetic moment . because of anisotropy , this moment has the energetically preferable orientation along the so - called easy axis .",
    "stable orientations are separated by magnetic anisotropy barrier @xmath12 , which ensures bistability .",
    "the relaxation of the magnetization @xmath13 of the ensemble of particles with the same anisotropy barriers is exponential in time . in case of the thermal relaxation",
    ", the relaxation - time @xmath14 at the temperature @xmath15 is given according to ref .",

    ", @xmath14 is very small compared to the time of observation of @xmath13 , so that @xmath13 fluctuates quickly over the barrier .",
    "if @xmath15 is low enough , @xmath13 remains blocked on one side of the barrier for a long time .",
    "the boundary between these two regimes depends on the time scale of the measurement .    here",
    ", the results of very detailed magnetic measurements of substances cu@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2 and cufe@xmath3o@xmath2 in the form of nano - sized particles are reported comparatively .",
    "they exhibit qualitatively the same magnetic behaviour and quantitatively different properties ( the blocking temperature , magnetic anisotropy and coercivity ) .",
    "the performed detailed measurements of the time - relaxation of the magnetic moment of the samples provides calculation of the magnetic viscosity and anisotropy , and also confirms that the relaxation follows from thermal activation .",
    "the investigated cu@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2 and cufe@xmath3o@xmath2 nanoparticles were prepared following basically the same procedure .",
    "the cupro - ferrite particles were formed by adding naoh to a water solution of fecl@xmath194h@xmath3o and cucl@xmath3 mixed in strictly fixed concentration ratios to achieve a variation of the composition with respect to the cu@xmath20fe@xmath21o@xmath2 initial formula for @xmath22=0.5 - 1.0 and co - precipitation in an alkaline medium at @xmath23 .",
    "the technological conditions were developed to apply the method of fabricating cufe@xmath3o@xmath2 nano - powders with and without cooperative jahn - teller distortion ( this was achieved through varying the cations ratio in the initial solution to 1.0 ) , and avoid the additional annealing of the samples .",
    "the other sample object of our investigation have the composition cu@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2 .    in our work",
    ", we used particles separated by means of applying a magnetic field after the first precipitate settled down following the introduction of the oxidant and the increase of the @xmath24 of the solution .",
    "the particles thus produced had the shape of a sphere or a prolate spheroid at sizes below 10 nm .",
    "the x - ray phase analysis was performed by using a tur - m62 apparatus with co@xmath25 radiation .",
    "the exact position of the lines and their widths were determined by the computer software for deconvolution and profile analysis of diffraction patterns .",
    "the xrd data exhibited consistently a single - phase spinel structure for all types of samples .",
    "the tem bright - field images and the grain - size statistics of the powders obtained were analyzed , too .",
    "the mssbauer spectra were taken with an electromechanical spectrometer working at a constant acceleration mode from 4.5 k to room temperature .",
    "a 70mc - @xmath26co(cr ) source and @xmath27-fe standard were used .",
    "the experimentally obtained spectra were computer fitted to a series of lorentzian curves by the least - squares method .    for the present magnetic measurements the powder of nanoparticles in molten liquid paraffin was dispersed and then cooled whilst vigorously shaking",
    "it is assumed that the particles in rigid paraffin stay fixed .",
    "this excludes the mechanical rotation of the particles as a possible way of changing of their magnetic moment vector .",
    "magnetic measurements were performed using commercial mpms5 squid magnetometer , which uses extraction through the induction coils to measure the magnetic moment of the sample .",
    "it provides high stability of temperature at the place of the sample and stable homogeneous magnetic field . due to the squid detection system , magnetic moment",
    "is measured with very high accuracy .",
    "besides the good temperature dependence measurements , this equipment is therefore very suitable for the slow and long - lasting relaxation measurements .    at first , magnetic measurements include the dependence of magnetic moment of the sample @xmath28 on the temperature @xmath15 .",
    "the sample was cooled down to 1.8k from room temperature in zero applied field . then the magnetic field was applied and the variation of @xmath28 was measured during the increasing of @xmath15 up to 290k .",
    "this gave the so called zero - field - cooled ( zfc ) curve .",
    "after that , the sample was cooled again to 1.8k , but now staying at the same applied magnetic field , and after that the variation of @xmath28 during the increasing of @xmath15 was measured .",
    "this gave the so called field - cooled ( fc ) curve .",
    "the temperature below which the splitting of zfc and fc curves appears because of the slow relaxation is called blocking temperature @xmath29 .",
    "secondly , @xmath30 curves for the applied magnetic field @xmath31 up to 5.5 t at different stable temperatures were measured .",
    "also , @xmath32 dependence in the highest attainable applied magnetic field @xmath31=5.5 t was measured .",
    "lastly , very detailed and precise measurement of the relaxation of magnetic moment of the sample at broad range of stable temperatures from 2k up to @xmath29 of each sample was performed .",
    "every sample was at first heated above @xmath29 in zero applied magnetic field .",
    "then the magnetic field of 0.03 t was imposed .",
    "after some waiting time the sample was cooled down to the desired temperature and stabilised .",
    "finally , the magnetic field was reversed to the opposite direction ( from 0.03 t to -0.03 t ) and @xmath28 was measured as the time elapsed during @xmath333 hours .",
    "this procedure was repeated for many different target temperatures below @xmath29 .",
    "the measured magnetic moment @xmath28 of the sample is not convenient for the comparison with other published data .",

    "we summarize basic data obtained from x - ray diffraction patterns at room temperature and from the analysis of bragg line - broadening and grain - size statistics from high - resolution photographs of different powders .",
    "the systematic processing of the data demonstrated that the amount of particles with spherical or prolate - spheroid shape exceeded 90% .",

    "this is also observed as a very slight change of the slope of @xmath100 curves in fig .",
    "[ relax ] during the measurement at some of temperatures .",
    "scaled curve actually covers a very wide time interval of several orders of magnitude compared to the measurement at only one temperature , therefore it is able to uncover this slow and slight change .",
    "all of measurements performed on the collection of nanoparticles of cu@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2 and cufe@xmath3o@xmath2 point to their superparamagnetic behaviour .",
    "it is expressed through mutual consistency of the mssbauer spectra , fc - zfc splitting , hysteresis and relaxation measurements . qualitatively the same phenomena in both samples were observed , which are characteristic for the assemblies of magnetic nanoparticles .",
    "however , quantitatively the difference in properties between two investigated samples is observed .",
    "it manifests in the different anisotropy and different value of the saturation magnetization .",
    "much greater anisotropy in cu@xmath0fe@xmath1o@xmath2 than in cufe@xmath3o@xmath2 is a consequence of the change of occupation of places inside a and b superlattices of the ferrimagnetic spinel structure with the copper and iron cations .",
    "the possible explanation for change of properties is the jahn - teller distortion in crystal lattice .",
    "most probably in the nanosized particle under the action of the laplace pressure , antiferromagnetic superstructure arises in the spherical particle , where the forces of exchange interactions are not sufficient to maintain the spontaneous magnetic moment ordering that is characteristic for fully built crystal structure of an edged particle .",
    "these zones affect the magnetic moments density and depend on the temperature .",
    "the relaxation data at many different temperatures show the unique time dependence of magnetic moment when appropriate scaling is performed .",
    "this is a confident criterium for thermal relaxation over the distributed potential barriers according to the described model .",
    "moreover , it allows to follow what happens with magnetic moment of the sample during very long times , covering several orders of magnitude .    exhibited mutual consistency of all performed different types of measurements",
    "is important point in the characterisation of new type of materials . also , presented phenomenological description of the magnetic relaxation provides an useful link between the experimental results and microscopic model .",
    "future work will search for the more precise answer to questions opened here .",
    "it will research in more details the hysteretic phenomena , blocking at higher applied magnetic fields and extension of the effective anisotropy with more details .",
