    "onsager s theory for irreversible processes provides a formal framework for non - equilibrium phenomena as diffusion , electrokinetic effects , and heat conduction .",

    "intriguing physical properties arise from the cross - terms , such as thermally driven electric currents .",
    "onsager established reciprocal laws between conjugate cross - coefficients @xcite , thus completing thomson s derivation for the thermoelectric effects and showing why the seebeck and peltier coefficients @xmath2 and @xmath3 differ merely by a temperature factor , @xmath4 @xcite .    as another classical example ,",
    "the soret and dufour effects describe the mass transport in a temperature gradient , and heat flow due to a concentration gradient .",
    "there is , however , a long - standing discussion whether , and eventually under which conditions , the corresponding  coefficients obey a reciprocity relation .",
    "thus it has been pointed out that the reciprocal laws impose rather strong conditions on the choice of fluxes and forces , which are not always easily verified @xcite .",
    "the soret and dufour effects are often discussed in terms of onsager s phenomenological equations for the heat and particle currents with cross - coefficients @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "it is then _ assumed _ that the measured thermal diffusion and dufour coefficients @xmath0  and @xmath1 correspond to @xmath5 and @xmath6 , such that the reciprocity relation for the latter applies equally well to the former .",
    "this approach has been taken by various authors , when discussing binary gases @xcite , organic liquids @xcite , molecular isotope mixtures @xcite , premelting solids with colloidal inclusions pep09 , and far - from - equilibrium systems @xcite .",

    "regarding liquids , @xmath0and @xmath1 seem to agree well for mixtures of cyclohexane and carbon - tetrachloride @xcite , yet significant discrepancies were reported for benzene - cyclobenzene and other systems @xcite . in recent years the soret effect of colloidal suspensions has been investigated in great detail @xcite ; unfortunately , there is a lack of corresponding dufour data .",
    "molecular dynamics simulations show a good agreement of the thermal diffusion and dufour coefficients , at least for simple model systems @xcite .    here",
    "we discuss the validity of the reciprocity assumption for @xmath0  and @xmath7 on the basis of non - equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "we consider regular systems where onsager cross - coefficients are identical , e.g. , @xmath8 .",
    "then the title of this paper reduces to the question whether , and eventually under which conditions , thermal diffusion is described by @xmath5 .",
    "this is formalized in sects . 2 and 3 , where we define @xmath0  and @xmath1 , and present onsager s phenomenological equations .",

    "the hat indicates volume specific quantities , such as the molecular chemical potential divided by the molecular volume , @xmath20 .",

    "the heat flow @xmath25 comprises two contributions , ordinary heat diffusion with conductivity @xmath18 , and the dufour effect which is driven by a concentration gradient in an anisotropic medium .",

    "it is assumed that the off - diagonal coefficients @xmath0and @xmath1  are related through onsager s reciprocal laws according to @xmath28the temperature factor is due to historical convention , similar to that between the seebeck and peltier coefficients , @xmath29 .",
    "kinetic theory confirms this relation to be satisfied in ideal gas mixtures @xcite , and there is evidence for its validity in liquid isotope mixtures mor80 .",

    "@xcite , we summarize the corresponding theory , that is , onsager s linear relations for thermodynamic fluxes and forces .",
    "we do not discuss the regression hypothesis @xcite and suppose that the fluxes are linear functions of the forces ; note this assumption is often not justified for chemical reactions .      like any thermodynamic function , the entropy is constant in an equilibrium state .",
    "non - equilibrium phenomena are intimately related to entropy production .",
    "for example , gradient diffusion according to fick s law @xmath30 tends to smear out any  composition inhomogeneity and produces entropy at a rate @xmath31 . by the same token",
    ", a non - uniform temperature induces a heat flow @xmath32 from the hot to the cold and augments the entropy as @xmath33 .",
    "similar relations arise for chemical reactions and for viscous flow",
    ".    in the case of an initial perturbation , the system relaxes toward an equilibrium state ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 , ... ) of constant entropy . on the other hand ,",
    "if the inhomogeneity is maintained through continuous heat or matter supply , the system reaches a stationary non - equlibrium state and produces entropy at a constant rate .    with the mentioned dynamic variables , the rate of entropy production per unit volume reads as    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the heat flux , @xmath38 are the volume currents of the molecular species , @xmath39 are the compositon changes due to chemical reactions , and @xmath40 is the viscous pressure tensor .",
    "the corresponding thermodynamic forces are the gradients of the inverse temperature and the planck potential @xmath41 , the affinities @xmath42 , and the symmetrized rate of change of the fluid velocity field @xmath43 , with components @xmath44 .     for sufficiently weak deviations from the equilibrium state , onsager established linear relations between the fluxes and forces . because of the curie symmetry principle , the phenomenlogical relations do not mix scalar , vector , and tensor quantities .",
    "thus the coefficient matrix of the phenomenological equations is block - diagonal and decays in parts that are characterized by their tensor properties .",
    "the vector quantities @xmath37 and @xmath38 describe heat and mass diffusion . for a binary system ( @xmath45 )",
    "they  form 3 generalized fluxes which are , however , not linearly independent and can be reduced to 2 independent flows .  when describing the composition in terms of volume fractions , the particle currents cancel each other , @xmath46 ; eliminating that of the second component one obtains    [ 15 ] @xmath47the last term of each equation gives rise to both thermal and concentration gradients ,    @xmath48    where @xmath49 is the enthalpy and @xmath50 the gradient at constant temperature .",
    "thus the thermodynamic force @xmath51 involves the derivative of the chemical potential with respect to composition .    in many instances",
    "it turns out convenient to regroup all temperature gradients according to    [ 16 ] @xmath52comparison with ( [ 12 ] ) readily provides relations between unprimed and primed coefficients , e.g. @xmath53 .",
    "the heat flow @xmath25  is defined such that the entropy production involves products of conjugate forces and currents ; for a binary system with @xmath54 , the contribution of the vector quantities reads    @xmath55    according to ( [ 5 ] ) the primed heat flux accounts for diffusive transport only , whereas @xmath37 comprises in addition the enthalpy carried by the particle current @xmath22 . in the steady - state of a closed system , the latter vanishes and one has @xmath56 .",
    "now we turn to the remaining terms of the entropy production rate . that involving chemical reactions is described by scalar fields ,",
    "@xmath57where the coefficients @xmath58 relate the reaction products to the affinities @xmath42 .",
    "finally , the linear relation between the viscous pressure and the velocity gradient , @xmath59involves the fourth - rank viscosity tensor @xmath60 , which structure is rather simple in isotropic liquids , yet becomes more complex in liquid crystals @xcite . for compressible fluids ,",
    "the contraction @xmath61 comprises also a scalar term , which is small for most liquids and thus will discarded .",
    "according to onsager s reciprocal laws , the coefficient matrices @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath60 are symmetric , and in particular@xmath65 in many works on thermal diffusion , both chemical reactions and viscous flow are discarded from the beginning . then the different terms in ( [ 16 ] ) are readily identified with those in ( [ 2 ] ) and ( [ 4 ] ) , @xmath66where @xmath19 is the usual derivative with respect to composition @xcite .",
    "since @xmath5 and @xmath6 are reciprocal coefficients , these relations confirm ( [ 6 ] ) for the thermal diffusion and dufour coefficient .",
    "the above decomposition of the linear relations according to their tensorial properties does not imply , however , that the underlying physical phenomena are decoupled . whether each of the fluxes ( [ 16 ] ) , ( [ 14 ] ) , and ( 18 ) can be treated independently from the others ,",

    "still , in a colloidal suspension with non - uniform volume fraction @xmath246 , there may be an additional heat flux @xmath247 , and the reciprocal coefficient @xmath5 is expected to contribute an additional term to ( [ 69 ] ) .",
    "the many data collected for colloidal thermophoresis suggest , however , that this extra term is small .",
    "in particular , experiments show that @xmath0 is independent of the particle size ; it would be rather surprising if the heat flow @xmath248 , and thus the thermal diffusion and dufour coefficient @xmath249 , did not vary with the particle size .",

    "above we have discussed the relation between thermal diffusion and the dufour effect ( @xmath252 , and thermophoresis and the pressure - driven heat flow ( @xmath253 ) .",
    "similarly , the equilibrium between the molecular and micellar states in a surfactant solution , feeds a steady micelle current ( [ 40 ] ) that is proportional to the temperature gradient ; the coeffiicient @xmath0 is determined by the reaction rates of micelle formation .",
    "most authors use thermal diffusion  for molecular mixtures and thermophoresisfor colloidal suspensions , though in both cases the coefficient @xmath0 is defined by ( [ 2 ] ) .",

    "according to the preceding discussion , the reciprocity relation between @xmath81 and @xmath1 is valid for thermal diffusion only .",

    "ceases to be valid if the molecules respond differently to the thermal and concentration gradients in the thermodynamic force ( [ 19 ] ) .",
