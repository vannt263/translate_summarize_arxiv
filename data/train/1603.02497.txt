    "compartment models play an important role in the modeling of many biological systems ranging from pharmacokinetics to ecology @xcite .",
    "key values in understanding the dynamics of these systems are the transit time : the mean time a particle spends in the compartmental system measured as the mean time from entry into the system to leaving the system @xcite , and the mean age : the mean age of particles still in the system @xcite . it is well known that these quantities need not be the same @xcite .",
    "we are motivated by an interest in studying the dynamics of the terrestrial carbon cycle which is typically modeled as a number of discrete pools of carbon in plant biomass , litter and soil organic matter .",
    "many of the best studied models of the dynamics of carbon are linear , which reflects the fact that changes in carbon pools are proportional to the pool size @xcite .",
    "additionally , most analyses make the further assumption that all parameters describing the dynamics ( and the input fluxes ) are constant in time , leading to a model in the form of an autonomous linear differential equation . in this autonomous case",
    ", it is possible to derive analytic formulae giving expressions for the transit time @xcite .",
    "these formulae for transit time are given in terms of ( constant ) transfer coefficients among compartments and analogous formulae are available for the mean age of particles in the system .",
    "many applications of models of terrestrial carbon relate to situations in which constant model parameters are replaced by time - dependent functions .",
    "perhaps the most well - known examples are studies of how terrestrial carbon dynamics respond to climate change . in these",
    ", it is often assumed that the specific rates ( per unit carbon ) of carbon inputs and losses from the system change over time as a function of changes in climate , such as temperature .",
    "for example , increases in temperature are normally assumed to increase the rates of soil decomposition @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the compartmental models of interest are nonautonomous , i.e.  they depend on time @xcite .",
    "nonautonomous compartmental systems are special cases of linear nonautonomous differential equations @xcite , which , in contrast to the linear autonomous case , can not be solved analytically in general . yet , both the mean age of particles in the system and the transit time remain of great interest for these time - dependent systems , as both quantities can be potentially measured in the actual systems being modeled @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we develop a theory for transit times and mean ages of mass in nonautonomous compartmental systems . as noted in one of the first papers to study transit time @xcite , there is obviously a close connection between age distribution and transit time in compartment models .",
    "we will build on this relationship to develop an approach for understanding the definition of transit time .",
    "we define a time - dependent version of transit time as the mean age of mass leaving the compartmental system .",
    "we use a time - dependent version of the mckendrick ",
    "von frster equation @xcite , the classic first - order partial differential equation describing age distributions , to prove that the mean age of mass satisfies an ( inhomogeneous ) linear nonautonomous differential equation .",
    "we show that under weak conditions , this equation is exponentially stable . starting with demographic models highlights another important aspect of our approach .",
    "as is well known , solutions of demographic models depend on initial conditions , so quantities like the mean age and transit time also depend on initial conditions , but conventional definitions of these quantities ignore the influence of the initial conditions . for this reason",
    ", our nonautonomous approach also provides additional insight for autonomous compartmental systems that are not in equilibrium .",
    "we apply the theory we have developed to numerically study transit times for a nine - dimensional compartmental system model of the carbon cycle , which is a modified version of the carnegie ",
    "ames  stanford approach ( casa ) model @xcite .",
    "we compare our nonautonomous quantities to the classical notion of transit time for autonomous systems , where we freeze the nonautonomous system in time to obtain an autonomous system , and we assume that we are in equilibrium .",
    "our simulations illustrate the different and sometimes diverging trajectories of the autonomous and nonautonomous quantities over time .",
    "our results demonstrate the necessity of our theory for the computation of transit times in nonautonomous compartmental systems and in autonomous compartmental systems that are not in equilibrium .    this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec3 ] ,",
    "we first review the theory of transit times for autonomous compartmental systems , and we provide a heuristic derivation of the transit time formula .",
    "we then define nonautonomous compartmental systems in section  [ sec1 ] . in section  [ sec2 ]",
    ", we prove that under the assumption that the compartmental system is lower block triangular , and the diagonal blocks a diagonally dominant , the nonautonomous compartmental system is exponentially stable . in section  [ sec4 ] , we prove that the mean ages satisfy a linear nonautonomous differential equation , and we then use the stability criterion from section  [ sec2 ] to prove exponential stability of the mean age equation .",
    "we define the concept of a transit time for nonautonomous compartmental systems in section  [ sec5 ] . in section  [ sec6 ]",
    ", we show that our nonautonomous theory is consistent with the autonomous case , in the sense that we get exactly the well - known autonomous transit time formula when applying the nonautonomous transit time to an autonomous system .",

    "a detailed mathematical investigation of this phenomenon is outside the scope of the present study .",
    "the nonautonomous properties @xmath160 and @xmath161 show contrasting trajectories to the instantaneous properties @xmath39 and @xmath38 ( which we computed according to proposition  [ theo3 ] , but note that , since the system is nonautonomous , the assumptions of this proposition are not fulfilled ) .",
    "for example the latter properties change monotonically over time .",
    "this must be because the long term outcome of an increase in the input rate of young carbon and an increase in the output rate of old carbon is a decrease in the age of carbon both leaving and remaining in the system .",
    "over the course of the simulation the numerical values of the autonomous and nonautonomous properties become visibly different ( fig .",
    "this is because it will take a long time for the values of @xmath160 and @xmath161 to approach @xmath39 and @xmath38 due to the small loss rate of the ninth soil pool .",
    "models for terrestrial carbon cycling have led to renewed interest in the properties of compartment models .",
    "key quantities that have been studied over many years in compartment models with parameters fixed in time @xcite are the mean age of particles in the system and the transit time of particles leaving the system .",
    "formulae for these quantities that give the mean age and transit time in terms of parameters of the system in the long time limit have led to insights , but can not be applied to the case of changing parameters .    as parameters change , for example in a model of carbon cycling due to climate change , it is not correct to calculate the mean age or transit time from the instantaneous parameter values . using the theory of nonautonomous differential equations as a tool , and beginning",
    "with time dependent age structured models , we are able to define and derive formulae for the transit time and mean age for particles in the case of temporally changing parameters .",
    "these definitions lead to quantities that reduce to the analogous formulae for the autonomous ( constant parameter ) case when parameters do not change in time .",
    "however , the formulae for the nonautonomous case also highlight the fact that even in the constant parameter case the transit time and mean age do depend on initial conditions ; some of the standard formulae do not include this dependence .",
    "the difference between a transit time or mean age that is computed based on the parameters at a given instant and the better approach of taking into account the history of the system can be substantial as we illustrate using a variant of the casa model .",
