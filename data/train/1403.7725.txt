    "in physical world networks are ubiquities . many practical complex systems in natural and social sciences and",
    "also humanities can be modeled as networks of interacting systems .",
    "recently , the study of such complex networks has attracted much attention  @xcite .",
    "the complex networks can be grouped into different types depending on their structure into some universal categories , such as random networks  @xcite , scale free networks  @xcite , small world networks  @xcite , etc .    when there are several interacting dynamical systems on networks , they can exhibit a rich variety of dynamical behavior such as synchronization  @xcite , amplitude death  @xcite , multistability  @xcite , chimera states  @xcite , phase flip  @xcite , etc . which a single dynamical system is unable to show .",
    "occurrence of synchronization between interacting dynamical units is an important and fundamental nonlinear phenomenon and the study of synchronization of coupled dynamical systems has attracted considerable attention in the past decades  @xcite . in particular",
    ", the nonlinear behavior of coupled chaotic systems tends to separate the nearby trajectories of the coupled systems , while a suitable coupling between them brings back the trajectories together . in this competition ,",
    "when the later wins the coupled systems undergo synchronization .",
    "synchronization of coupled dynamical systems can be defined as a process where two or more coupled systems adjust their trajectories to a common behavior when they are coupled or driven by a common signal . in the context of coupled chaotic systems different types of synchronizations have been studied in the past years .",
    "these include complete or identical synchronization  @xcite , phase synchronization  @xcite , lag synchronization  @xcite , anticipatory synchronization  @xcite , imperfect phase synchronization  @xcite , generalized synchronization  @xcite , measure synchronization in hamiltonian systems  @xcite etc . among these",
    "the simplest and the most studied is the complete synchronization which occurs in two or more coupled identical dynamical systems and is characterized by the equality of state variables of the interacting systems .",
    "the stability of synchronization is normally determined by the negativity of the largest transverse lyapunov exponent  @xcite .",
    "pecora and carroll have developed an elegant way , namely the master stability function ( msf ) for analyzing the stability of complete synchronization for a network of identical dynamical systems  @xcite .",
    "the msf allows one to study the stability of synchronization of different networks using a single function and has been used widely for a comparative study of synchronization of different networks of identical dynamical systems  @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the small world network enhances synchronizability of a network of coupled identical systems  @xcite . in ref",
    "@xcite it is shown that having smaller network distance is not sufficient for performing best synchronizability properties , it is also required to have homogeneous degree distribution among the coupled dynamical systems . ref .",
    "@xcite introduces a new family of graphs , namely the entangled networks , which show better synchronizability .",
    "these entangled networks are interwoven and have extremely homogeneous structures , i.e. the degree distributions are very narrow .",
    "the network of coupled identical dynamical systems is an ideal situation and in practical situations it is almost impossible to have a network of coupled identical dynamical systems .",
    "so it is important to study coupled nonidentical systems and see how their behavior compares with that of coupled identical systems .",
    "for the coupled nonidentical systems , one can not get complete synchronization .",
    "instead in this case the synchronization is of a generalized type where the state variables of the coupled dynamical systems are related with some functional relationship  @xcite .",
    "the nonidentical nature of the coupled systems can lead to desynchronization bursts which is known as the bubbling transition  @xcite .",
    "after the desynchronization burst the system returns to the synchronized state .",
    "sun et al .",
    "@xcite have extended the master stability approach for nearly identical systems to calculate the deviation from the average trajectory and the deviation is shown to be bounded .    in this paper , we extend the msf formalism to a system of nearly identical systems . by",
    "coupled nearly identical systems we mean systems which have a node dependent parameter ( ndp ) .",
    "preliminary results of this study were earlier reported in  @xcite .",
    "we then extend the msf formalism to coupled nearly identical systems with degenerate eigenvalues of the coupling matrix .",
    "we also obtain msf for systems with more than one ndp .",
    "we find that , in general , the stability of synchronization can be improved when we introduce non - identical nature in the coupled systems .",
    "next we use msf to study size - instability of synchronization in well structured networks . by a well structured network",
    "we refer to a network in which the number of nodes can be changed without changing the basic structure and symmetry of the network , e.g. star network , ring network etc .",
    "the size - instability is the phenomena that there is a critical number of oscillators that can be coupled in a well structured network to obtain synchronization and beyond this critical number no stable synchronization can be seen .",
    "the phenomena of size - instability in identical oscillators is well known and has been studied widely  @xcite . for the star network of",
    "coupled nearly identical systems , we find that it is possible to increase the critical number of nodes beyond which synchronization is unstable , by a judicious choice of ndp . in particular , for coupled rssler systems the critical number can be increased by having a larger frequency for the central node . on the other hand , we find that for a ring network , the critical number of nodes is not significantly affected by an ndp .",
    "these results are verified by explicit numerical calculations . in part",
    "ii of this study @xcite , we use msf to construct optimized networks for better synchronization properties and study properties of these optimized networks .",
    "for networks of coupled identical systems the stability of complete synchronization has been well analyzed . as discussed in the introduction , pecora and carroll ( 1998 )",
    "@xcite introduced a master stability function ( msf ) which can be calculated from master stability equations . using the master stability function",
    "one can calculate the largest transverse lyapunov exponent for a network and study and compare the stability properties of synchronization of different networks .",
    "for coupled nearly identical systems , the synchronization is of a generalized type .",
    "we now extend the msf approach to coupled nearly identical systems .      in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have extended the formalism of msf to coupled nearly - identical systems and in this subsection , we briefly review the same .",
    "this is done for the sake of completeness and also to establish the notation .",
    "we start by considering a network of @xmath0 coupled dynamical systems as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the @xmath3-dimensional state vector of system @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the node dependent parameter ( ndp ) which makes the systems nonidentical , @xmath6 and @xmath7 give respectively the dynamical evolution of a single system and the coupling function , @xmath8 $ ] is the coupling matrix and @xmath9 is the coupling constant .",

    ". for complete synchronization all the state variables of the coupled systems become equal , i.e. @xmath16 and the motion of the coupled systems are confined to the subspace defined by @xmath17 and this subspace is the synchronization manifold .",
    "the complementary space defines the transverse manifold .",
    "the synchronized state is stable when all the transverse lyapunov exponents are negative .",
    "the lyapunov exponents are calculated by expanding around the synchronous solution @xmath18 .    for coupled nonidentical systems ,",
    "the synchronization is of the generalized type , where the state variables of the coupled systems are related by a functional relationship  @xcite . here , we expand eq .",
