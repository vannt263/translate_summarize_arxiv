    "there have been numerous studies reporting the presence of soft ( @xmath2kev ) x - ray absorption in excess of that expected from the galaxy towards radio quasars .",
    "however , such studies have found very little evidence for associated optical reddening by dust ( elvis et al .",
    "strong evidence for associated and soft x - ray absorption in a number of radio loud quasars has been confirmed ( eg .",
    "mathur et al .  1994 and mathur 1994 ) , though evidence for associated optical extinction in these sources is weak .",
    "the lack of associated optical extinction may be due to a selection bias .",
    "since x - ray absorption estimates are derived from spectra which require relatively large x - ray counts , such studies may be biased against those sources with low counts due to strong x - ray ( and hence optical ) absorption .",
    "it is also possible that x - ray absorption in most sources is dominated by the presence of warm ( ionised ) absorbers close to the primary continuum source ( pan , stewart & pounds 1990 ) .",
    "these have little broadband effect in the optical bandpass but may strongly absorb x - ray emission .",
    "if strong optical extinction by dust is known a - priori however , then associated absorption of soft x - rays is expected to be present at some level .",
    "evidence for excess soft x - ray absorption in a number of optically reddened radio quasars has been presented by kollgaard et al .",
    "these authors claim that their results are strongly model dependent , and are also consistent with explanations other than absorption by associated gas and dust .",
    "their sample size is also too small to draw any reasonable conclusions .",
    "evidence for an association was recently reported by puchnarewicz et al .",
    "( 1996 ) for a large sample of seyfert 1s and quasars .",
    "these authors found a correlation between optical spectral slope and optical  to  soft x - ray continuum slope that was consistent with absorption by dusty `` cold '' gas with column densities @xmath3 and approximately galactic dust abundance .    in this paper",
    "we consider the drinkwater et al .",
    "( 1997 ) sample of flat - spectrum radio sources ( hereafter parkes quasars ) , a subset of which are known to be optically reddened ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , very little spectroscopic x - ray data exists for these quasars to constrain absorption gas column densities .",
    "siebert et al .",
    "( 1998 ) were able to measure power - law photon indices for 105 sources in the sample .",
    "they did not find any evidence for excess soft x - ray absorption in the red sources , but they did find that ( at low redshifts ) the red quasars had lower soft x - ray luminosities than the blue quasars and concluded that the x - ray data support the importance of dust in the reddest quasars .",
    "we re - analyse the soft x - ray ( 0.1 - 2.4kev ) _ rosat _ broadband measurements from siebert et al .  ( 1998 ) using a different approach .",
    "we consider a subsample of 119 out of the 323 sources in the drinkwater et al .",
    "sample , all of which have contemporaneous @xmath4 and @xmath5 photometry , useful for estimates of spectral slopes . about half of these sources are detected in soft x - rays and upper limits are available for the remainder .",
    "our analysis uses a simple gas - dust absorption model to explore various correlations involving optical ( and near - ir)to  soft x - ray continuum slope and optical reddening .",
    "we then use the broadband soft x - ray data to search for such correlations and determine whether soft x - rays are absorbed at a level consistent with the observed optical reddening .",
    "the parkes half - jansky flat spectrum sample contains 323 sources and is described in detail by drinkwater et al .",
    "the sample was initially selected from the parkes 2.7 ghz survey ( bolton , savage & wright 1979 and references therein ) according to the following criteria : 2.7 ghz radio flux densities @xmath6 jy , radio spectral indices @xmath7 ( where @xmath8 ) , galactic latitude @xmath9 and b1950 declinations : @xmath10 . by selecting flat - spectrum radio sources at high frequency , one is biased towards core - dominated quasars , since lobe dominated quasars and radio galaxies have steeper radio spectra and hence are likely to comprise the majority of detections in low frequency surveys . on the basis of spectroscopic identification alone ,",
    "the present sample contains a much higher quasar fraction ( @xmath11 ) than any existing radio sample , with a broad and flat distribution in redshift to @xmath12 .    for the purposes of this paper we have used sources with contemporaneous photometric measurements in @xmath13 , which are complete for a subsample of 119 ` non - extended ' sources .",
    "these were obtained by p. francis ( private communication ; see whiting et al .",
    "1998 ) in april , july and september 1997 using the anu 40   and 2.3 m telescopes .",
    "these measurements provide reliable estimates of broadband colours , likely to be unbiased with respect to uncertainties from intrinsic variability .",
    "rms uncertainties based on noise statistics in these magnitudes are @xmath14 mag .",
    "since we are primarily interested in the properties of quasars , only spatially unresolved sources in the optical and near - infrared have been considered .",
    "all sources appearing extended in @xmath4 and @xmath5 , or with optical spectra showing features characteristic of those seen in normal nearby galaxies are excluded .",
    "we also ensured that the sources have broad emission lines in their optical spectra with velocity widths @xmath15 ( at fwhm ) , typical of normal qsos .",
    "redshifts are available for all the sources and span the range @xmath16 , most of which are from new spectroscopic observations ( see drinkwater et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "x - ray data for all parkes quasars has been provided by siebert et al .  (",
    "the fluxes are in the soft x - ray band 0.1 - 2.4 kev , and most were determined from the _ rosat _ all - sky survey and ( for 49 sources ) from archival pointed pspc observations . of the 323 sources in the drinkwater et al .",
    "sample , 163 were detected in soft x - rays at the @xmath17 level . for the remaining 160 sources , @xmath18",
    "upper limits to the counts were determined .",
    "we have used the total broadband fluxes as computed by siebert et al . from the count rates , corrected for galactic absorption only .",
    "where available , we also use their estimates of the photon energy indices @xmath19 ( where @xmath20 ) determined from explicit power - law fits to spectral data or from hardness ratio techniques ( see   [ slopes ] ) . in total , for our subsample of 119 parkes quasars with contemporaneous photometry , 57 are detected in soft x - rays and upper limits are known for the remaining 62 .",
    "as claimed by webster et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , if the large spread in optical  to  near - ir colours of parkes quasars is due to reddening by dust , then it is expected that the reddest quasars may also be absorbed in soft x - rays .",
    "we test this hypothesis by making simple predictions involving optical  to  soft x - ray ( @xmath21 ) and near - ir  to  soft x - ray ( @xmath22 ) continuum slopes .",
    "this section will briefly outline our assumptions and predictions using a simple gas - dust absorption model .",
    "the degree of x - ray absorption by metal enriched gas primarily depends on the total column density of gas in the line - of - sight . in the case of the galactic ism where the metal abundance is typically @xmath23 relative to hydrogen by mass ( grevesse & anders 1991 ) , hydrogen and helium are responsible for almost all of the absorption at energies @xmath2kev .",
    "we predict the amount of x - ray absorption expected for a given optical dust extinction measure by assuming for simplicity , the range in galactic gas - to - dust ratios derived empirically from ly-@xmath24 absorption measurements in the galaxy ( bohlin et al .  1978 ) :",
    "@xmath25 where @xmath26 is the extinction ( colour excess ) in @xmath27 colour .",
    "this relation is also consistent with empirical estimates of the dust - to - gas ratio in the smc and lmc by bouchet et al .",
    "( 1985 ) and fitzpatrick ( 1985 ) .",
    "the effective x - ray optical depth , @xmath28 , defined such that the change in flux due to absorption is @xmath29 , is given by : @xmath30 where @xmath31 represents the effective absorption cross - section per h atom at energy @xmath32 and @xmath33 is defined by equation ( [ ext_col ] ) .",
    "we adopt cross - sections for x - ray absorption as derived by morrison & mccammon ( 1983 ) for a gas with galactic ism metal abundances . typically , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "together with the ratio of total to selective extinction @xmath36 as given by whittet ( 1992 ) , the optical depths at 1kev and 2kev from equation ( [ taux ] ) can be written respectively : @xmath37 @xmath38    as a simple estimate , if a source at redshift @xmath39 , ( the median redshift of the parkes quasar sample ) suffers an intrinsic extinction @xmath40 mag ( a typical mean value for parkes quasars ; masci 1997 ) , then absorption by associated neutral gas would reduce the _ observed _ 1kev flux by about a factor @xmath41 .",
    "for comparison , assuming the generic @xmath42 dust law , an intrinsic extinction of @xmath40 mag will result in a decrease of the _ observed _ optical flux by a factor @xmath43 .",
    "thus , we see that the decrease of observed optical flux by dust extinction is generally larger than the corresponding decrease in soft x - ray flux by associated gas . even for low @xmath44 sources ,",
    "the discrepancy in flux reductions in these two regimes is about a factor of 5 , and increases rapidly with @xmath44 due to the energy dependence of @xmath31 .",
    "this property will become important when we examine the correlation involving optical  to  x - ray continuum slopes in   [ apred ] .",
    "based on optical and x - ray spectral properties of parkes quasars , both webster et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and masci ( 1997 ) claimed that in most cases , the reddening is likely to be due to dust _ intrinsic _ to the quasars .",
    "thus for simplicity , the following analysis will assume all absorbing material to be located at the redshift of the quasar .",
    "we also assume that all predicted quantities discussed below ( ie .",
    "slopes and extinction measures ) refer to the quasar _",
    "rest frame_.    if a source with some intrinsic ( unabsorbed ) optical  to  x - ray power - law slope , say @xmath45 ( where @xmath8 ) suffers intrinsic absorption by dusty gas , then in its rest frame , the resulting slope ( @xmath46 ) can be written in terms of extinction optical depths as follows : @xmath47 we shall also consider the near - infrared  to  x - ray continuum slope ( @xmath48 ) , so that analogously , @xmath49 according to the available data , our anlysis will assume the @xmath4-bandpass ( @xmath50 nm ) for the optical and the @xmath5-bandpass ( @xmath51 m ) for the near - infrared",
    ". we shall consider the x - ray flux at 1kev , so that the optical depth @xmath28 in equations ( [ alphabx ] ) and ( [ alphakx ] ) is defined in terms of the optical extinction @xmath52 by equation ( [ tauav ] ) .",
    "using the extinction coefficients @xmath53 from savage & mathis ( 1979 ) in the optical and whittet ( 1988 ) in the near - infrared for diffuse galactic dust , we find @xmath54 by combining the above relations , we can see from equations ( [ alphabx ] ) and ( [ alphakx ] ) that for given intrinsic ( unabsorbed ) values @xmath45 and @xmath55 , absorption by dusty - gas will predict a specific correlation between optical extinction ( @xmath52 ) and the corresponding absorbed continuum slopes .    to make some illustrative predictions applicable to radio quasars , the intrinsic slopes @xmath45 and @xmath55 need to be specified . as a working measure , we assume for simplicity , these slopes to be those found for _ optically - selected _ quasars . as argued by masci ( 1997 ) and francis et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , this choice is based on the claim that optically - selected quasars are expected to be strongly biased against significant absorption by dust .",
    "this indeed is consistent by a number of studies which find a relatively small scatter in the optical  to  x - ray ( 1kev ) flux ratio of optically - selected quasars ( eg .",
    "kriss & canizares 1985 , wilkes et al .  1994 , la franca et al .",
    "the distributions in this flux ratio indicate a mean value @xmath56 with dispersion @xmath57 , and which does not significantly differ between radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars ( wilkes & elvis 1987 , green et al .  1995 ) .",
    "this value is also consistent with that implied by a composite sed for radio loud ( optically - selected ) quasars derived by elvis et al .",
    "( 1994 ) . due to the absence of sufficient near - infrared data for optically selected samples ,",
    "we adopt the @xmath58-to-1kev continuum slope as indicated by this composite where @xmath59 , and assume a scatter similar to that found for @xmath45 in the studies above . from these studies , our predictions will assume the following ranges : @xmath60 @xmath61    the radio - selected parkes quasars for comparison show a dispersion in @xmath21 almost five times greater ( see   [ rescomp ] ) than those of optically - selected quasars ( eq . [ [ intslopes ] ] ) .",
    "siebert et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have shown that this is consistent with dust - gas absorption , however in addition , the larger scatter could also include effects from any of the following : an additional x - ray emission component over and above that of radio - quiet quasars with a wide distribution of strengths and/or slopes , enhanced x - ray variability , or a strong angle dependence of the observed x - ray emission due to beaming .",
    "although such effects can be important in some sources and contribute to the scatter , our analysis here is purely concerned with the hypothesis that it is mostly due to variable amounts of absorption in the optical and x - ray bands .    given the ranges in intrinsic slopes defined by equation ( [ intslopes ] ) and the ranges defined by the uncertainties in the extinction measures @xmath62 ( eq . [ [ tauav ] ] ) and @xmath63 , @xmath64 ( eq . [ [ taubk ] ] ) , we show in figure  [ pred ] the expected range spanned by @xmath46 and @xmath48 as a function of @xmath52 .",
    "there appears to be a distinct behaviour in each of these slopes with @xmath52 , with an anti - correlation in @xmath46 and correlation in @xmath48 . as discussed in   [ model ] and as seen in equations ( [ alphabx ] ) and ( [ alphakx ] ) , this is due to the amount of absorption expected in @xmath4 and @xmath5 relative to that at 1kev . from the above discussion",
    ", we have typically : @xmath65 and @xmath66 , so that the correlation involving @xmath48 is purely due to the fact that absorption causes a greater decrease in soft x - ray flux than that in the near - infrared .",
    "it is important to note that the trends of these correlations sensitively depend on the assumed dust - to - gas ratio ( eq . [ [ ext_col ] ] ) and metallicity ( ie .",
    "the cross - section @xmath67 in eq .",
    "[ [ taux ] ] ) , which for simplicity were fixed to local ism values .",
    "a variation in either of these quantities by at least a factor of five is likely to change the sign of the correlation .    the predictions in figure  [ pred ]",
    "are represented by the following linear relations : @xmath68 @xmath69 given the uncertainties , the slope of the @xmath22 versus @xmath52 relation is insignificant , however for typical galactic ism conditions , the crucial feature in figure  [ pred ] is the opposite trend predicted in each of these slopes in the presence of absorption by dusty gas .",
    "this will provide a powerful diagnostic for testing the dust reddening hypothesis for parkes quasars .",
    "this section will compare the predictions of figure  [ pred ] with estimates of the slopes involving the soft ( 0.1 - 2.4 kev ) x - ray bandpass ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) derived from the available _ rosat _ data , and extinctions ( @xmath52 ) derived from the observed optical reddening . to facilitate a direct comparison with the predictions of figure  [ pred ] however",
    ", we first transform these quantities into the source rest frame .      due to the frequency dependence of optical extinction and x - ray absorption , a similar dependence of these quantities on the redshift of the absorbing material in an _",
    "observer s _ frame is expected .",
    "this implies that a plot similar to figure  [ pred ] which uses _ observed _ quantities will also include a hidden and complicated dependence of the absorption on redshift .",
    "the added effects of changing spectral shape with source redshift ( ie .",
    "k - correction effects ) will also introduce ambiguities .",
    "thus , assuming the absorbing material is intrinsic to the quasars , we will transform all observed quantities to the source rest frame .",
    "this will enable a direct and unambiguous comparison with the predictions of figure  [ pred ] .",

    "when an individual photon index was not available , the average photon index for radio - loud quasars , @xmath74 ( eg . schartel et al .",
    "1996 ) was used .",
    "the rest frame spectral indices , for example @xmath75 , were determined by applying a simple k - correction which assumes a power - law in each of the optical and soft x - ray bands . if @xmath76 and @xmath77 are respectively the optical and x - ray power - law slope , @xmath44 the source redshift and @xmath78 the _ observed _ optical  to  x - ray slope , then the corresponding value in the rest frame is given by : @xmath79 x - ray slopes @xmath77",

    "rest frame optical extinctions @xmath52 in each source were derived from the observed optical  to  near - ir reddening as defined by the contemporaneous colours @xmath84 and @xmath85 and assuming intrinsic ( unabsorbed ) colours as measured in optically - selected quasars . as discussed in ",
    "[ apred ] , optically - selected quasars are expected to be strongly biased against significant absorption by dust . this claim is consistent with their relatively small scatter in colours ( eg .",

    "extinction @xmath52 for each source was estimated by computing the average of the two extinction values obtained independently from the two observed colours @xmath84 and @xmath85 . as shown in figure [ av ]",
    ", there is a tight correlation between these estimates for @xmath52 , suggesting each reddening indicator may equally provide a measure of the extinction . from the scatter about the line of equality , the values are consistent to within @xmath94 mag .",
    "this correlation suggests that the @xmath95 and @xmath96 colours of parkes - quasars vary with each other in such a way implying a characteristic spectral curvature from @xmath97 to @xmath58 that is consistent with reddening by dust .",

    "the triangles represent @xmath18 lower limits on these indices from the x - ray non - detections . in the lower left corners of each figure , we show two ` conservatively ' calculated error bars for both the @xmath52 and spectral indices . from the dispersions in our assumed intrinsic colours",
    "[ [ intc ] ] ) and scatter in figure  [ av ] , we have typically : @xmath98 mag .",
    "the spectral index error bar assumes a maximum error in the x - ray flux of 25% ( ie .",

    "following siebert et al .",
    "( 1998 ) we also included an uncertainty for possible variability in the non - simultaneous x - ray and @xmath4 ( or @xmath5 ) measurements .",
    "this assumes a variability of @xmath100 mag , typical for one of our quasars with a 20 year rest - frame timescale between the optical and x - ray measurements ( hook et al .",

    "[ data]b ) appear to be somewhat anti - correlated and correlated with @xmath52 respectively .",
    "we have formally computed the probabilities that the observed correlations are real by taking into account all lower limits on the spectral slopes and using the techniques of survival analysis .",
    "the correlation and regression analyses were performed using the asurv package ( version 1.3 ; la valley et al .",

    "the predicted ranges in these slopes as a function of the optical extinction ( taking account uncertainties in dust - to - gas ratios and intrinsic slopes ; see   [ model ] ) are represented by the regions within the dashed curves in figure  [ data ] . for @xmath107 , we see there is very good agreement between the observed slopes of parkes quasars and our assumed range in intrinsic ( unabsorbed ) values ( eq . [ [ intslopes ] ] ) from studies of optically - selected quasars .",
    "the optical ( and near - ir)to  soft x - ray continuum slopes of the bluest parkes quasars therefore show relatively small scatter similar to those of optically - selected quasars , strengthening the claim that such sources are unbiased with respect to reddening by line - of - sight dust .",
    "the increased scatter in these slopes when all parkes quasars are considered can then be attributed to dust extinction .",
    "in particular , the range in extinctions : @xmath108 mag , are consistent ( within our conservative errors ) with the maximum extinction @xmath109 mag derived by siebert et al .",
    "( 1998 ) from the dispersion in optical  to  x - ray flux ratio alone .",
    "our results are also consistent with studies of the optical  to  soft x - ray continua of a large sample of medium to moderately - hard x - ray selected agn by puchnarewicz et al .",
    "their study suggests moderate absorption by dusty gas with approximately galactic dust - to - gas ratio and columns @xmath110 . using the lower limit @xmath111 from equation ( [ ext_col ] ) and a galactic extinction curve",
    ", this corresponds to @xmath112 mag , entirely consistent with the range found in our sample of radio - selected quasars .    to summarise",
    ", we have found significant correlations between optical ( and near - ir)to  soft x - ray continuum slope and optical extinction that are consistent with the predictions of a simple dust model .",
    "the results of figure  [ data ] imply that if the observed scatter in optical slopes of parkes - quasars is due to extinction by dust in their environs , then soft x - rays are absorbed at a level fully consistent with this hypothesis .",
    "the anti - correlation involving @xmath21 and optical extinction ( fig .  [ data]a ) can be easily explained by gas - dust absorption whereby optical flux is relatively more absorbed than that at 1kev .",
    "this anti - correlation is qualitatively similar to that claimed by mcdowell et al .",
    "( 1989 ) for a sample of quasars which appeared to show a weak `` big blue bump '' feature relative to their near - infrared and soft x - ray emission .",
    "these authors however interpreted the trend as due to an intrinsically varying blue - bump spectrum and not extinction by dust .",
    "a changing blue luminosity may thus mimic a variation in optical extinction .",
    "it is therefore possible that the observed correlation in figure  [ data]a is spurious and due to a secondary trend , ie . from a dependence of both @xmath21 and @xmath52 ( or optical slope ) on @xmath97-band luminosity .",
    "a direct investigation of the relationship between these quantities however shows that such an effect is unlikely to explain the observed trend .",
    "also , since the optical - uv flux in the blue - bump component also provides a source of photoionizing flux for emission line regions , this model also predicts to first order a correlation between the equivalent widths of emission lines and optical - uv continuum slope .",
    "our analysis of the emission line equivalent widths for parkes quasars ( masci 1997 , francis et al .",
    "1998 ) however strongly argues against this possibility .",
    "an intrinsically varying optical / uv continuum will also require the x - ray continuum to vary simultaneously to satisfy the correlation involving @xmath22 in figure  [ data]b . this however would be inconsistent with the trend in figure  [ data]a .",
    "such a mechanism therefore requires physically unmotivated fine tuning of the near - infrared , optical and soft x - ray emission to explain the observed correlations .    the correlation involving @xmath22 ( fig .",
    "[ data]b ) indicates that all of the optical ",
    "to1kev continuum flux appears absorbed relative to that in the near - infrared .",
    "it is encouraging to find that such a correlation is qualitatively similar to that claimed by ledden & odell ( 1983 ) between radio  to  soft x - ray and radio  to  optical slope for several optically reddened radio quasars .",
    "they concluded that absorption by associated gas and dust was the most likely explanation .",
    "their statistics however were too low from which to draw any firm conclusion .",
    "the indirect confirmation for soft x - ray absorption from figure  [ data ] implies that the soft x - ray , optical and possibly also the near - ir continuum emission must traverse the same dust component . as suggested by previous studies to explain the difference in soft x - ray spectral properties of radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars , a significant fraction of the soft x - ray flux in radio - quasars",
    "is believed to arise from synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) emission associated with the radio jet emission ( eg .",
    "wilkes & elvis , 1987 , ciliegi et al .",
    "according to standard unified models for agn , the radio jet emission may extend to distances @xmath113kpc from the central engine .",
    "thus , if the soft x - rays are mostly ssc in origin , then the results of figure  [ data ] require the absorbing medium to extend on a scale similar to that of the radio emission . if the absorbing medium however were situated close to the central agn so that the ssc x - rays suffered minimal absorption ( with effectively @xmath114 ) then the predictions of figure  [ data ] will change drastically : a much steeper anti - correlation in figure  [ data]a and the opposite behaviour ( ie .",

    "more direct studies of x - ray absorption , preferably via high quality spectral observations are required to further explore this issue .",
    "we have tested the dust - reddening hypothesis to explain the relatively large dispersion in optical  to  near - infrared colours of quasars in the parkes sample of flat - spectrum radio sources by searching for associated absorption by gas at soft x - ray energies .",
    "we have used broadband ( 0.1 - 2.4 kev ) _ rosat _ all - sky survey data and pointed pspc observations provided by siebert et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , and contemporaneous optical  near - infrared photometry available for 119 of the 323 sources in this sample .",
    "a soft x - ray absorption signature was searched for indirectly by exploring the optical ( and near - infrared)to  x - ray continuum properties as a function of optical extinction , where specific strong correlations are expected under a simple gas - dust absorption model .",
    "our main conclusion is that significant correlations ( at @xmath0 confidence ) are observed between rest frame optical ( and near - infrared)to1kev continuum slope and optical extinction that are consistent with the predictions of a simple model .",
    "this model assumes the range in dust - to - gas ratios and metal abundances derived empirically from the galactic ism , intrinsic ( unabsorbed ) slopes as observed in optically - selected quasars , and as suggested by previous studies , that all absorption is intrinsic to the quasars . under these assumptions",
    ", we conclude that soft x - rays are absorbed at a level consistent with the range of extinctions @xmath1 mag observed .",
    "the dust associated x - ray absorption is therefore consistent with physical conditions ( eg .",
    "gas ionization state ) found in the diffuse local ism .",
    "no warm ( ionised ) absorption is required , since the data does not indicate excess x - ray absorption relative to that in the optical compared to the galactic model predictions .",
    "this is contrary to numerous previous studies of the soft x - ray properties of agn .",
    "high quality x - ray spectra to detect heavy metal absorption edges however are required to place stronger constraints on the physical properties .",
    "these data will also be necessary to provide ` direct ' estimates of the amount of x - ray absorption and for constraining the geometry of absorbing / emitting regions . due to the faintness of many of the reddest sources , spectral data",
