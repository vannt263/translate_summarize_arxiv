    "recently the lattice boltzmann equation ( lbe ) method has been developed as a new computational fluid dynamics ( cfd ) method .",
    "this method originated form a boolean fluid model known as the lattice gas automata ( lga ) @xcite which simulates the motion of fluids by particles moving and colliding on a regular lattice .",
    "the averaged fluid variables , such as the density and velocity , were shown to satisfy equations similar to the navier - stokes equations .",
    "the lbe method improves this idea by following only the ensemble - averaged distribution functions , therefore eliminating the time - consuming statistical average step in the original lga @xcite .",
    "simplified collision models were later used in place of the collision operator derived from the lga to improve both the computational efficiency and the accuracy .",
    "most noteworthy , the simple collision model of bhatnagar , gross , and krook @xcite was applied to the lattice boltzmann equation , yielding the so called lattice bgk model @xcite .",
    "the additional flexibility in this approach allows the removal of the artifacts of the lga , specifically the lack of galilean invariance and the velocity dependent pressure .",
    "this method was found numerically to be at least as stable , accurate and computationally efficient as traditional cfd methods for simulation of simple single - phase incompressible flows @xcite .",
    "more importantly , since fluid motion is simulated at the level of the distribution functions , the microscopic physics of the fluid particles can be incorporate easily like in other particle methods .",
    "many complex fluid phenomena due to interparticle interactions , such as capillary phenomena , multiple phase flows , and non - linear diffusion , can be simulated naturally @xcite .    in most lbe models",
    "so far , only mass and momentum conservation is implemented .",
    "the macroscopic equations of these models correspond to the navier - stokes equation with an ideal - gas equation of state and a constant temperature .",
    "however it is important and sometimes critical to have the capability of simulating thermal effects simultaneously with the fluid flows .",
    "obviously the temperature distribution in a flow field is of central interest in heat transfer problems . in most geophysical flows ,",
    "the temperature difference is the driving mechanism of the motion of the fluid .",
    "more importantly , when part of the fluid system undergoes phase transition , as in the boiling and evaporation processes , the evolution of the temperature field is directly coupled with the fluid dynamics . since the lbe method has the most advantage in the simulation of complex fluids with multiple phases and phase transitions , it is necessary to develop the capability of simulating thermodynamics with the lbe method .    in general",
    ", the simulation of thermal systems by the lbe method has not achieved the same success as that of iso - thermal flows .",
    "theoretically , a lbe model with energy conservation can be constructed @xcite to yield a temperature evolution equation at the macroscopic level .",
    "however , the model so obtained suffers from severe numerical instability @xcite , especially in three - dimensions ( 3d ) .",
    "additional stabilization procedures have to be invoked to achieve stability comparable to that of conventional cfd methods , _",
    "e.g. _ , finite difference schemes .",
    "moreover , when interparticle forces are included as in the multi - phase models , the energy conservation is further complicated by the potential part of the internal energy . for these reasons constructing a practically usable non - ideal - gas lbe model with energy conservation",
    "is difficult if not impossible .",
    "nevertheless , in many circumstances where the viscous and compressive heating effects can be neglected ( small brinkman number limit ) , the temperature field is passively advected by the fluid flow and obeys a much simpler passive - scalar equation .",
    "this same equation also governs the diffusion of each individual component in a fluid mixture . by taking advantage of this formal analogy between heat and mass transfer",
    ", we can simulate the temperature field as an additional component of the fluid system .",
    "early two - component lga model @xcite exhibited qualitative features of thermal convections . in a previously developed multiple component lbe model @xcite",
    ", we have shown that the evolution of the concentration fields is galilean invariant and obeys fick s law .",
    "the diffusivity is independent of the viscosity , allowing a changeable schmidt number ( or prandtl number in the terminology of heat transfer ) .",
    "this model does not implement energy conservation and therefore has the same stability as the non - thermal lbe models and other conventional cfd methods . by adding one more component , the computation efficiency , either memory - wise or time - wise ,",
    "is not compromised compared with the approach of direct implementation of energy conservation because fewer speeds are required for each component .    in this paper",
    ", we present the simulation of the rayleigh - bnard convection ( rbc ) as an example . due to its simplicity and the richness of the phenomena",
    ", this problem has been extensively studied both theoretically and experimentally @xcite and serves as an excellent benchmark problem for numerical schemes because detailed results are available for comparison with numerical computations . in section  [ sec:2 ] , we briefly review the multiple component lbe model and then formulated it for the simulation of the boussinesq equation . the implementation of the isothermal no - slip boundary condition is also discussed . in section  [ sec:3 ] , simulation results are presented and compared with theoretical and experimental results . the limitation and some further extensions of this method are discussed in section  [ sec:4 ] .",
