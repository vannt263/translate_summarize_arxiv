    "while liquids have long - range disorder , they exhibit a local order that drives many of their physical properties .",
    "this short - range order is usually characterized through the radial distribution functions ( rdfs )  @xcite .",
    "however , the rdfs convey little or indirect information about the three - dimensional ( 3d ) local structure of liquids .",
    "spatial distribution functions ( sdfs ) have then been introduced for this purpose  @xcite . since then , several indicators of the local order of liquids have been proposed , in particular for the important case of liquid water , including the statistics of voronoi polyhedron  @xcite , local structure index  @xcite or angular correlation  @xcite . recently , local density fluctuations and the probability distribution of occupancy of a given volume have attracted a lot of attention , in the framework of the theory of hydrophobicity  @xcite .",
    "these have been used to characterize and locate patches of hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity at surfaces  @xcite or around proteins  @xcite . however , as such , they have not been used to characterize the microscopic structure of liquids .    in a very different context ,",
    "that of electronic structure , related concepts have been used to locate electron pairs  @xcite . in general",
    ", these methods are designed to identify regions in 3d space with particular chemical and physical meaning .",
    "the analysis is based on the information provided by the electronic probability density calculated from the many - body wave function , but offers a way to define and to visualize some relevant regions in real space .",
    "the work presented in this paper is motivated by the interest for developing an alternative approach to study the local structure of liquid systems , combined with the clear similarities between the electronic probability density and the atomic many - body probability distribution of a liquid .",
    "we propose here a method based on the identification of regions of space where the probability of finding one and only one particle is maximum .",
    "we refer to these regions as maximum probability domains ( mpds ) .",
    "the definition of this probability is given as the generalization of the concept  @xcite used for the analysis of electronic probability densities in molecules and indeed can be generalized to the case of @xmath0 ( and only @xmath0 ) particles .",
    "the information encoded in this quantity has a many - body nature , also when considering the one - particle occupancy probability .",
    "it has to be viewed as the probability of finding @xmath0 particles within a certain region of space with all other particles outside .",
    "therefore , such probability is different from any reduced @xmath0-particle probability density , since the degrees of freedom of the @xmath1 remaining particles ( @xmath2 being the total number of particles in the system ) are not integrated out . in analogy to such quantities , however , the probability can be evaluated by using a standard sampling procedure with molecular dynamics ( md ) or monte carlo ( mc ) trajectories .",
    "we illustrate the method by applying it to describe the structure of pure liquid water and to define the solvation shells of sodium ions in a diluted water solution .",
    "we compare the results of our study with more standard approaches based on the rdfs and with various definitions of solvation shells .",
    "it will become apparent from the illustrations that the method offers an efficient complementary tool to the analysis of liquid structures , both qualitatively and quantitatively .",
    "the one - particle mpd defines the boundary of the 3d region available to a given particle , where it is not likely that another particle can penetrate .",
    "when a set of mpds is identified around a central water molecule or sodium ion , we obtain a 3d - map of the locations of the surrounding molecules with a number of mpds that is usually smaller , as we will see later , than the standard coordination number .",
    "the request of exclusive occupation of a mpd by only one particle is responsible for this feature , even though for rigid local structures , as the first solvation shell of water , there are clear similarities between the two pictures ( mpds and coordination numbers ) .",
    "the results for liquid water at different densities are mainly presented as a test case , in order to prove that the method is able to recover known results even if the problem is analyzed from a new perspective .",
    "a more challenging application is represented by the case of sodium in water . here ,",
    "the one - particle mpds located around the central ion are organized such that the spherical symmetry of the problem is maintained .",
    "however , the shape and dimension of the domains give a 3d resolution that is not accessible , or at least not directly , when employing the sdfs .",
    "we find relevant to stress here that , as will become clear from the applications , the major strength of the method developed in the paper is not to be searched in a new overall picture of the liquid achieved by determining the mpds .",
    "the details are what make this method an interesting alternative or complement to more standard analysis techniques . being able to pinpoint the location of the interstitial water molecules that are mainly affected by the increase of the density in liquid water or analyzing the shape of the regions occupied by water around a central molecule or ion",
    "could be used to predict properties such as the life - time of a h - bond or the kinetic of a reaction .",
    "these developments will not be discussed here , since our major goal is establishing the theoretical basis of the method and proving its efficiency with a few illustrations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "probability ] , we introduce the general definition of the one - particle occupancy probability . then , the maximization of such probability is posed as a geometric optimization problem and solved within the framework of the level set method ( lsm ) in section  [ sec : level set method ] . section  [ sec : implementation ] gives the details for the numerical implementation of the method and we present the two illustrations mentioned before in section  [ sec : application ] .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : conclusion ] we conclude and state our outlook for future developments .",
    "the one - particle maximum probability domain ( mpd ) is defined as the region in three - dimensional ( 3d ) space where the probability of finding one , and only one , particle is maximum . in the present context , the term particle stands for an atom or the center of mass of a molecule or some other point of high symmetry in a molecule .",
    "the choice depends on the information that we want to extract from this analysis . for instance , in the study of liquid water , as presented in this paper , the _ particles _ will be the oxygen atoms in the molecules .    if a system is composed of @xmath3 identical particles with positions @xmath4 and we focus on the @xmath2 particles with positions @xmath5 for @xmath6 , we can define the one - particle occupancy probability of a domain @xmath7 , @xmath8 , as the probability of finding one , and only one , particle in the region of space @xmath7 with all other particles located outside @xmath7 .",
    "this probability  @xcite , written as @xmath9 is what in mathematics is called a set function .",
    "here , @xmath10 is the configurational probability density and , in the particular case of water and sodium diluted in water , will be explicitly defined in appendix  [ app : probability ] .    the domain @xmath7 is given in a reference frame that is centered on the particle at @xmath11 , which is kept out of statistics ( in the sense that in eq .",

    "moreover , the notation in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : def probability ] ) indicates that all integrals involving the variables @xmath13 and @xmath14 are performed over @xmath12 .",
    "this definition of the probability can be easily extended to @xmath0 particles in @xmath7 and @xmath1 particles in @xmath12 .",
    "( [ eqn : def probability ] ) satisfies the normalization condition @xmath15 which can be easily obtained for an ideal gas ( in the absence of interactions among particles ) occupying a volume @xmath16 , as the configurational probability density is explicitly known , i.e. @xmath17 , thus allowing for the analytic calculation of eq .",

    "the term in the sum is equal to one only if the number of particles @xmath30 inside the volume @xmath7 , for the configuration @xmath29 , is equal to 1 .",
    "the construction of the mpds is carried out by initially choosing some centers around the central particle ( labeled by 0 ) and some volumes enclosing these centers .",
    "a set of mpds will be then identified as @xmath31 the centers around the 0th particle can be chosen quite arbitrarily , however we find useful to locate them in correspondence of the local maxima of the spatial distribution function ( sdf ) or of the radial distribution function ( rdf ) .",
    "it is worth underlining that @xmath32 is not an absolute maximum  , is the absolute largest , but finds several mpds associated to different values of @xmath8 separated by regions where this probability has ( local ) minima .",
    "] over all space of volumes , but it is the one found by a local search ( the closest to the initial choice ) .    the definition of the set of mpds @xmath33 can be used for the characterization of the structure of atomic and molecular liquids as an alternative or a complement to standard tools such as distribution functions , solvation shells and coordination numbers .",
    "the determination of the optimized domains @xmath34 s is posed as a geometric optimization problem , since the probability @xmath35 has to be maximized with respect to variations of @xmath36 . in the following section we present  @xcite",
    "the level set method ( lsm ) to be applied in the search of the mpds , in particular in a liquid .",
    "a central concept in the procedure referred to as lsm is that of shape derivative .",
    "the function @xmath8 belongs to a specific class of what is normally called a set function and the variations of a set function with respect to changes of the set define its shape derivative .",
    "the aim of the numerical procedure developed and tested in this paper is to determine how @xmath8 changes by varying @xmath7 , such that the value of the probability itself is maximized .",
    "appendix  [ app : lsm ] is devoted to a detailed discussion on the shape derivative and on its expression in the context of the mpds . here",
    ", we will focus on illustrating the essence of such concept .    the set function defined in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : def probability ] ) depends on the integration volume , @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , when @xmath7 changes , also the value of the integral performed over @xmath7 changes : such ( infinitesimail ) variations of @xmath8 will be indicated with the symbol @xmath37 , the shape derivative . in the particular application discussed here ,",
    "we request that this variation of the integration domain follows a well - defined law : the value of the integral has to increase as @xmath7 is varied .",
    "this choice of variation allows us to define a _ deformation law _ , namely a fictitious equation of motion such as @xmath38 with @xmath39 the border of @xmath7 . the evolution , or deformation , of the domain , where @xmath40 is a fictitious time - step , is completely defined by the fictitious velocity field @xmath41 .",
    "the explicitly expression of the velocity field is determined in appendix  [ app : lsm ] , by requiring that @xmath42 .",
    "the maximization condition on the shape derivative enables us to optimize the domain @xmath7 towards reaching the maximum of the set function @xmath8 .",
    "the numerical procedure developed to evolve the domain @xmath7 towards reaching the maximum value of @xmath8 is given in appendix  [ app : lsm ] , while in section  [ sec : implementation ] we implement the algorithm based on the lsm to compute the mpds in a liquid system .",
    "to apply the lsm we need to choose a starting set . in the two cases of pure water or sodium diluted in water",
    "we locate the initial domains @xmath36 in correspondence to the local maxima of the oxygen - oxygen sdf or of the sodium - oxygen rdf , respectively .",
    "this difference is related to the fact that the sdf of a sodium ion is spherically symmetric .",
    "the two - particle sdf  @xcite @xmath43 , employed here and calculated around a central ( 0th ) water molecule , is proportional to the probability of finding an oxygen atom in @xmath44 irrespective of the position of all other oxygen atoms  @xcite , given a certain configuration @xmath45 of the central molecule @xmath46 the probability density under the integral sign is a conditional probability density , @xmath47 exactly as in eq .",

    "( [ eqn : marginal probability ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath43 is now a function of the three cartesian coordinates @xmath44 and can therefore be visualized in 3d space , as we will show below .    by employing bader analysis  @xcite ,",
    "we locate maxima , and domains around them , of the two - particle sdf in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : oo sdf ] ) . in doing that",
    ", we apply an analysis method designed for the study of electronic probability densities to the study of a liquid .",
    "bader analysis partitions the space in regions assigned to the maxima of the density . from these regions starts the search of the mpds which is not a partition of the space and can result in overlap between domains or partial filling of the spaces .",
    "exactly as it is done for bader partitioning the electronic density , the bader procedure applied to the two - particle sdf is based on the assumption that the sdf can be written as the sum of @xmath51 independent contributions , @xmath52 where @xmath51 is the number of total domains to be determined by the procedure and is equal to the number local maxima ( modes ) of the density . in writing this relation , we make the further hypothesis that @xmath53 only if @xmath54 , with @xmath55 a volume in 3d space .",
    "the main objective here is to determine the @xmath55 s , referred to as bader domains , and to use them as initial conditions for the optimization procedure based on the lsm .",
    "since we are working in 3d space , bader domains are enclosed by the 2d surfaces where the density gradient has zero flux . in actual calculations , to fully identify the bader domains , given an initial @xmath56 , we compute the vector @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the origin of our reference system , and we evaluate the gradient of @xmath43 at that point . then we construct a steepest - ascent path in 3d space whose tangent in every point is the direction of the gradient .",
    "when the maximum is reached , all points of that path are associated to a bader volume .",
    "another point @xmath56 is then chosen and the procedure is iterated until all space points have been assigned to a specific maximum .",
    "indeed , starting from different points , the same maximum can be reached thus the bader volume has to be updated .",
    "the main reason for choosing bader partitioning as initial condition for our optimization procedure is efficiency .",
    "the density landscape surrounding a water molecule is very complex and not homogeneous .",
    "therefore , starting with initial domains that already contain information about the local structure of the liquid does help in efficiently determining the mpds . employing bader analysis",
    "is , however , not possible in general , but it depends on the topology of the two - particle sdf .",
    "in fact , this approach fails in the case of the spherically symmetric sodium - oxygen sdf and we have to proceed differently .",
    "we take as initial sets few spheres of different radii , generally smaller than 2.5   , whose centers are approximately located at a distance from sodium corresponding to the two main maxima of the sodium - oxygen rdf , i.e. at @xmath59    and @xmath60    from the sodium ion ( see for instance fig .",

    "we observe in the three examples that the one - particle occupancy probability in the absence of interactions is much smaller than those calculated for water .",
    "the interactions among the particles of the liquid indeed stabilize their distribution and it is in particular the repulsion that prevents the occupation of a mpd by more than one particle ( that would lead to the decrease of the value of the probability ) .",
