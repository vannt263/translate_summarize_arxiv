    "thick relativistic accretion disks and tori around black holes ( bhs ) can form as transient structures in several astrophysical scenarios , including core - collapse of massive stars  @xcite and the merger of neutron star ( ns )  @xcite and ns - bh binaries  @xcite .",
    "many models of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) rely on the existence of massive dense accretion disks around bhs  @xcite .",
    "the observed @xmath6 erg energy powering grbs @xcite is believed to be coming either from the accretion disk and/or rotation of the central object . if this energy comes from the disk  , then  assuming that the efficiency of converting disk energy into that of grb can at most be @xmath7 as in many other astrophysical scenarios  @xcite  the accretion disk should have a mass of @xmath8 .",
    "recent numerical simulations have demonstrated that the mass of the disk resulting from binary ns - ns ( bh - ns ) mergers , which are thought to be candidates for central engine of short grbs ( see , e.g.  @xcite , but also  @xcite ) , can be in the range of @xmath9  @xcite . due to their larger",
    "initial mass , in core - collapse of massive stars , which are believed to be progenitors of long grbs @xcite , significantly more mass is available for forming disks  @xcite .    the neutrino - annihilation mechanism for triggering grbs @xcite , in which neutrinos emitted by the disk annihilate predominantly at the rotation axis to produce @xmath10 pairs and deposit energy behind the jet , rely on super - eddington accretion rates , which can take place only in high - density ( @xmath11 ) disks .",
    "moreover , the efficiency of neutrino annihilation at the rotation axis and the requirement of a small baryon load of the relativistic ejecta  @xcite was shown to strongly favor a toroidal structure for accreting matter  @xcite .",
    "the duration of prompt @xmath12-ray emission is @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) for long ( short ) grbs , while that of the later - time non-@xmath12 ray emission can be as long as @xmath15 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recent observations of grb afterglows have revealed a variety of late - time emission processes , including x - ray plateaus , flares , and chromatic breaks  @xcite , some of which can persist up to @xmath16 following the initial grb prompt emission ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "the amount of energy released in the late - time emission phase can be comparable or even larger than that produced during the prompt emission phase .",
    "both the prompt and the late - time emissions can be explained as the result of the activity of the central engine ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , although alternatives models exist ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . if the emission energy comes from the disk , such long durations of observed grb emission either require the disks to accrete in a quasi - stable manner for a sufficiently long period of time , or require the engine to be restarted in some way .",
    "early studies of the stability of accretion disks have revealed that they can be subject to several types of axisymmetric and/or non - axisymmetric instabilities in a number of circumstances  @xcite .",
    "instabilities can lead to highly variable and unstable accretion rates , posing a serious challenge to the viability of `` accretion - powered '' grb models .",
    "the so - called dynamical runaway instability of thick accretion disks around bhs was first discovered by abramowicz , calvani & nobili @xcite .",
    "this instability is similar to the dynamical instability in close binary systems , when the more massive companion overflows its roche lobe .",
    "in such a case , the radius of the roche lobe shrinks faster than the radius of the companion , leading to a catastrophic disruption of the latter . in disk+bh systems ,",
    "a toroidal surface analogous to the roche lobe can be found .",
    "a meridional cut of this surface has a cusp located at the @xmath17 lagrange point .",
    "if the disk is overflowing this toroidal `` roche lobe '' , then the mass - transfer through the cusp will advance the cusp outwards inside the disk .",
    "this can result in a catastrophic growth of the mass - transfer and disruption of the disk in just a few dynamical timescales .",
    "abramowicz et al .",
    "@xcite studied the properties of mass transfer using many simplifying assumptions : a pseudo - newtonian potential for bh gravity  @xcite , constant specific angular momentum of the disk , and approximate treatment of the disk self - gravity .",
    "they found that the runaway instability occurs for a large range of parameters , such as the disk radius and the disk - to - bh mass ratio @xmath18 .",
    "subsequent and somewhat more refined studies found that the rotation of the bh has a stabilizing effect  @xcite , and a non - constant radial profile angular momentum was found to strongly disfavor the instability  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "studies using a newtonian pseudopotential for the bh  @xcite and relativistic calculations with fixed spacetime background  @xcite found indications of the self - gravity of the disk to favor the instability . however , montero et al .",
    "@xcite recently performed the first self - consistent and fully general relativistic simulations of thick accretion disks around bhs in axisymmetry for a few dynamical timescales .",
    "they found no signatures of a runaway instability during the simulated time , perhaps implying that the self - gravity of the disk does not play a critical role in favoring the instability , at least during the first few dynamical timescales .",
    "the problem of the existence and development of non - axisymmetric instabilities has a long history .",
    "for thin keplerian self - gravitating disks it was found that the toomre parameter  @xcite can be used to determine stability against both local clumping or fragmentation , and formation of global non - axisymmetric modes . for thick pressure - supported disks , papaloizou and pringle discovered  @xcite the existence of a global hydrodynamical instability that develops on a dynamical timescale in disks with negligible self - gravity and constant specific angular momentum .",
    "a follow - up publication  @xcite found this instability also in the disks with power law distribution of specific angular momentum @xmath19 for all @xmath20 .",
    "kojima  @xcite found the papaloizou - pringle ( pp ) instability in equilibrium tori on a fixed schwarzschild background  @xcite using a linearized perturbative approach .",
    "subsequent works clarified the nature of the pp instability  @xcite , established how it redistributes specific angular momentum  @xcite and discovered that accretion has a stabilizing effect on the disk  @xcite .",
    "in particular , narayan et al .",
    "@xcite showed that the pp modes are formed by two boundary wave - like perturbations with energy and angular momentum of opposite signs that are coupled across a forbidden region near the mode corotation radius .",
    "for wide disks around bhs , the accretion suppresses the development of the inner boundary wave and therefore has a stabilizing effect on pp modes  @xcite . for slender disks , the development of pp modes",
    "is mostly unaffected by accretion  @xcite .",
    "the pp instability itself amplifies accretion by exerting torques on the disk and redistributing specific angular momentum  @xcite .",
    "when the self - gravity of the disk has been taken into account , it was found  @xcite that two new types of non - axisymmetric instabilities appear , while the pp instability disappears for most of the models except slender ones with weak self - gravity .",
    "the first type of unstable modes ( j - modes ) appears in strong self - gravity regime , and it is an analog of the classical jeans instability .",
    "the second type of unstable modes was found in the strong and medium self - gravity regimes  @xcite .",
    "the modes of this type are referred to as intermediate modes ( i - modes ) and represent elliptic deformations of the disk ( or triangular , square , etc.deformations for higher azimuthal numbers  see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "yet another type of instability , the so - called `` eccentric instability '' , was discovered in  @xcite for thin nearly keplerian self - gravitating disks when the central mass was allowed to move .",
    "an elaborate mechanism called `` sling amplification ''  @xcite was proposed to describe this instability .",
    "subsequent investigation  @xcite of this instability in thin disks suggested a different mechanism and predicted that the system is dynamically unstable only when the mass of the disk exceeds the mass of the central object .",
    "finally , woodward , tohline , and hachisu @xcite presented an extensive parameter study of thick self - gravitating disks in newtonian gravity to determine the types , growth rates and pattern speeds of non - axisymmetric modes .",
    "the central mass in their simulations was allowed to move , and they used 3d time evolutions of the disk models with wide range of parameters , including disk - to - central object mass ratios @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "several recent publications address accretion disks and instabilities in these disks in context of grb central engines . in  @xcite ,",
    "rezzolla et al .  studied the properties of accretion disks resulting from binary ns mergers .",
    "they obtained thin accretion disks with masses @xmath23 and no evidence of growing non - axisymmetric modes or runaway instability . in  @xcite ,",
    "taylor , miller , and podsiadlowski used 3d sph simulations with detailed microphysics and neutrino transport to follow a collapse of an iron core up to the formation of a thin massive accretion disk and development of global non - axisymmetric modes .",
    "they found that torques created by the non - axisymmetric modes provide the main mechanism for angular momentum transport , leading to high accretion rates of @xmath24 , which may create a favorable conditions for powering grbs .",
    "the stability of disks to runaway and non - axisymmetric instabilities is a three - dimensional problem that has to be addressed in the framework of full gr .",
    "one issue of importance is to understand if the runaway instability is affected by non - axisymmetric instabilities , and vice versa . despite significant theoretical and computational effort , previous studies of the runaway instability do not give a definite answer to this question . to our knowledge ,",
    "only the work by rezzolla et al .",
    "@xcite explored the stability of the disks in 3d and full gr ( for the disks that form in their binary ns merger simulations ) .",
    "however , it is important to create a comprehensive overall picture of the stability of accretion disks for a richer variety of disk models , which would require investigating a wider range of parameters . in our work",
    ", we study in detail the stability of slender and moderately slender disks with constant distribution of specific angular momentum , which are expected to be more unstable both to runaway  @xcite and to non - axisymmetric instabilities  @xcite compared to models of rezzolla et al .",
    "our study is based on three - dimensional hydrodynamics simulations in full gr .",
    "we model our disks using the ideal fluid approximation ( i.e.  without viscosity ) with a @xmath0-law equation of state ( eos ) and @xmath1 .",
    "we do not include additional physics such as magnetic fields or neutrino and radiation transport due to the complexity and computational cost of the resulting problem .",
    "nevertheless , the adopted approach will allow us to identify gr effects which can operate in more complex setting that include more realistic microphysics , neutrino / radiation transport and magnetic fields . also , we limit ourselves to the case of non - rotating bhs , while the case of rotating bhs will be studied in future publications .",
    "another aim of this paper is to estimate the detectability of the gravitational waves ( gws ) by the accretion disk dynamics .",
    "the radial and/or non - axisymmetric oscillations of accretion disks can be a source of strong gws .",
    "if non - axisymmetric deformations persist for long enough time , then the emitted gws can be detectable by current and future gw detectors @xcite , provided the source is not too far away .",
    "further work on the stability properties of accretion disk could shed more light on the number of cycles a non - axisymmetric deformation can persist , and thus on the prospects of detecting gws from such systems .    this paper is organized as follows : section  [ s : numericalmethod ] describes the formulations and numerical methods used in this paper , including multiblock grids ( subsection  [ ss : multiblock ] ) and the formulations used to evolve the general relativistic ( subsection  [ s : grevolution ] ) and hydrodynamic ( subsection  [ s : hydroevolution ] ) equations . section  [ s : idsetup ] describes the grid setup , initial data construction procedure and the analysis techniques for the non - axisymmetric instabilities .",
    "sections  [ s : timeev ] and  [ s : nonaxisym ] present the results of the time evolution of self - gravitating disks and the analysis of non - axisymmetric instabilities .    throughout the paper we use cgs and geometrized units @xmath25 .",
    "the numerical time - evolution scheme used in our study can be split into two main parts : the spacetime evolution , and the fluid dynamics equations .",
    "these two parts are evolved in a coupled manner .",
    "the numerical code that we use has been developed within the computational infrastructure  @xcite , and uses the mesh refinement and multiblock driver  @xcite . a separate module based on",
    "provides a range of multiblock systems to represent a variety of computational domains for 3d evolution codes  @xcite .",
    "the module for evolving the gr hydrodynamics equations uses the multiblock code  @xcite , which has been coupled to the multiblock - based module for evolving the spacetime  @xcite .",
    "the latter implements the generalized harmonic formulation of the einstein equations in first - order form  @xcite .",
    "below we give a brief description of the methods implemented in each module .         as another test of the coupling between the gr and hydro parts of the code",
    ", we evolved a tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) solution on a seven - block system , and measured the frequencies of its fundamental oscillations both in the cowling approximation and in full gr . in these tests , we use geometrized units in which @xmath26 .",
    "we choose a star with @xmath27 , @xmath28 and the value of rest - mass density in the center @xmath29 .",
    "these parameters produce a tov star with gravitational mass @xmath30 and circumferential radius @xmath31 . this system has already been extensively studied in the literature and used for the assessment of relativistic hydrodynamical codes ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the seven - block cubed sphere system that we used ( see fig .  [",
    "f : mypatchsystems]a ) has the outer radius @xmath32 , which makes the star occupy @xmath33 of the domain in radial direction and leaves extra room for small oscillations .",
    "the size of the cubical block in the center is @xmath34 , placing it completely inside the star .",
    "the bulk of the star is therefore threaded by interpolation boundaries between the blocks .",
    "the cubical block contains @xmath35 volume cells , and the outer blocks have @xmath36 cells . for the tests , we used resolutions @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , which roughly correspond to @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 points across the star .    to observe and measure the fundamental mode ,",
    "we artificially add a small initial perturbation , roughly corresponding to the shape of the mode : @xmath41 the amplitude was chosen to be @xmath42 .",
    "[ f : tovcentraldensity ] displays the resulting oscillatory behavior of the rest - mass density in the center of the star for three different resolutions . left and right panels correspond to fixed ( cowling approximation ) and dynamical spacetime geometries , respectively .",
    "oscillations of the density are accompanied by a secular drift , which reflects accumulation of truncation errors and converges away with resolution at approximately second - order convergence rate .",
    "conserved quantities such as the total rest mass and the total angular momentum ( not shown ) also exhibit the second - order convergence , as expected . in particular , for the cowling approximation case , the simulation continued up to @xmath43 , and the final rest mass is conserved up to @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 percent for resolutions with @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "for the full gr case , the simulation continued for @xmath47 and the rest mass is conserved up to @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 percent for the same three resolutions .",
    "this shows that the rate of the mass loss in cowling and full gr simulations is approximately the same , as expected .",
    "because the bulk of the star is threaded by interpolation boundaries between the blocks , the mass loss is significantly higher in this setup than in case of a regular cartesian grid , where we normally observe that the mass is conserved up to 7 - 8 significant digits for a similar resolution .",
    "a fourier transform of @xmath51 allows to measure the frequencies of the dominant oscillation modes .",
    "[ f : tovfourier ] shows the fourier power spectrum of @xmath51 in cowling and full gr cases for simulations with the highest resolution @xmath52 .",
    "both spectra contain three easily identifiable peaks corresponding to the fundamental radial modes @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 . the same plot also shows derivatives of the spectral power with respect to the frequency , computed using the central finite differencing scheme .",
    "zeroes of these numerical derivatives provide accurate estimates of the location of frequency peaks .",
    "the frequency of the @xmath53-mode in cowling approximation is @xmath56 , which is in agreement with the value of @xmath57 , found in  @xcite .   in the fully general relativistic case",
    ", we obtain the frequency @xmath58 , which also agrees with the value @xmath59 , found in  @xcite .",
    "note that the error in the values of fundamental frequencies above is estimated as the distance between the root of the power spectrum derivative and the nearest point with a non - zero value ."
