    "we explain our ideas and results in more detail .      in @xcite , a geometric construction of mirror geometry based on ( immersed ) lagrangian floer theory was proposed .",
    "it automatically comes with a functor transforming lagrangian branes to matrix factorizations , which realizes the homological mirror symmetry conjecture .",
    "the construction was applied to orbifold spheres @xmath0 to derive homological mirror symmetry , using the immersed lagrangian defined by seidel @xcite ( see figure [ fig : lagintro ] ) .",
    "moreover for the elliptic curve quotient @xmath23 , the construction leads to an enumerative meaning of the mirror map .",
    "the superpotential @xmath3 in equation is obtained by counting polygons bounded by the seidel lagrangian shown in figure [ fig : lagintro ] . in order to classify all possible holomorphic polygons",
    ", we do a careful treatment to the related combinatorial geometries in the orbifold universal cover of @xmath0 .",

    "the first tessellation is given by the pre - image of the horizontal equator of @xmath0 .",

    "the seidel lagrangian has three self - intersection points .",

    ", we show that it suffices to count embedded polygons in @xmath24 ( lemma [ lem : lift ] ) .",
    "a polygon in @xmath24 which contributes to @xmath3 will be called a _ polygon for the potential_.    given a polygon for the potential , we consider the intersection of the polygon with the hexagon tessellation @xmath27 , which gives what we call an @xmath37-diagram .",
    "we find out a characterization of all @xmath37-diagrams ( lemma [ lem : diagram ] ) , and thereby classify all polygons for the potential combinatorially .",
    "moreover , area formulas for polygons are deduced in terms of combinatorial data of @xmath37-diagrams ( theorem [ thm : area ] ) .",
    "another combinatorial object we use is _ boundary word _ of a polygon for the potential .",
    "it is obtained by recording the intersection pattern between the tessellation @xmath27 and the boundary of a polygon using three letters @xmath29 .",
    "we deduce its characterizing properties in lemma [ lem : standard ] .",
    "next , we find an algorithm to generate all possible polygons for the potential in hyperbolic cases , by the so - called elementary move ( definition [ defn : move ] , [ defn : move ] ) . such an algorithm is needed since there are infinitely many different types of polygons for the potential in the hyperbolic cases . roughly speaking ,",
    "elementary move is a systematic way to enlarge a polygon for the potential .",
    "we define elementary move in terms of the corresponding @xmath37-diagram .",
    "correspondingly we have the so - called _ cut - glue _ operation ( section  [ s : hyp ] ) on boundary words .",
    "if one of @xmath38 equals @xmath39 , then the elementary move and cut - glue operation become more complicated and they are defined separately .    in theorem",
    "[ thm : move ] , we show that elementary moves generate all polygons for the potential ( or all @xmath37-diagram ) from the minimal @xmath31-triangle .",
    "we associate a natural number @xmath40 to every polygon for the potential and show that each polygon is obtained by applying @xmath41 elementary moves from the minimal @xmath31-triangle in lemma [ lem : pcount ] .    in summary",
    ", we construct an algorithm to compute the potential in the hyperbolic case . in section [ ss : eval ] , we apply the algorithm in several examples to compute @xmath3 inductively .",
    "the examples are computed by running our algorithm in mathematica .",
    "a mathematica code for the computation of @xmath3 in the case of @xmath42 can be found in @xcite .",
    "the mirror map matches the flat coordinates on the khler moduli and the complex moduli of the mirror and is essential in the computation of gromov - witten invariants using mirror symmetry .",
    "it arises from classical deformation theory and can be obtained from solving picard - fuchs equations in the b side .",
    "enumerative meaning of the mirror map was obtained in the compact semi - fano toric case and toric calabi - yau case @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the mirror map equals to the so - called syz map , which arises from syz construction and is written in terms of disc invariants .",
    "we expect that such a derivation of the mirror map from the a - side should hold in great generality .",
    "in particular , it was shown in @xcite that for the elliptic curve quotient @xmath43 , the mirror map @xmath44 equals to @xmath45 under the relation @xmath11 , where @xmath46 is the khler parameter of @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are generating functions of triangle countings where the three corners of the triangles are mapped to the immersed generators @xmath50 and @xmath51 respectively , and @xmath52 with @xmath53 being the area of the minimal @xmath31 triangle .",

    "the relations @xmath11 and @xmath57 come from the geometric facts that @xmath47 has area eight times the minimal @xmath31 triangle , and @xmath24 has area three times @xmath47 .",

    "<S> furthermore , we prove that the open gromov - witten potential is convergent , even in the general - type cases , and has an isolated singularity at the origin , which is an important ingredient of proving homological mirror symmetry . </S>"
