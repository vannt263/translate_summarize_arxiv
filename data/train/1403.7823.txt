    "in this paper we study the fibonacci hamiltonian . along with the almost mathieu operator ,",
    "this particular operator is the most heavily studied schrdinger operator , with dozens of mathematics papers and hundreds of physics papers devoted to it .",
    "there are several reasons for this extensive interest in the spectral properties of the fibonacci hamiltonian .",
    "the first and perhaps most important reason is that this operator is a central model in mathematical physics .",
    "namely it is relevant in the study of electronic properties of quasicrystals .",
    "quasicrystals are materials that were first discovered by shechtman in 1982 , and this discovery led to a paradigm shift in materials science . in diffraction experiments",
    "they produce patterns consisting of sharp bright spots , the so - called bragg peaks , while at the same time these diffraction patterns display symmetries that conclusively prove that the arrangement of atoms in the sample can not be periodic .",
    "this came as a surprise as it had been believed that bragg peaks can only be observed in the diffraction of materials for which the arrangement of atoms is periodic .",
    "it therefore took the scientific community a while until this discovery was properly digested and accepted , and it was finally published in the 1984 paper @xcite .",
    "shechtman has received numerous honors and distinctions for this discovery , including the 2011 nobel prize in chemistry .    since the 1980 s mathematicians have studied appropriate models of quasicrystals .",
    "naturally , the choice of these models is guided by the distinctive property of real - life quasicrystals , namely that of having a pure point diffraction which in turn displays symmetries that rule out periodicity .",
    "the central examples of the commonly accepted mathematical quasicrystal models are the fibonacci tilings or sequences in one dimension and the penrose tilings in two dimensions . indeed ,",
    "these examples belong to all classes of models that are typically considered in their respective dimension . in particular , they may be generated both by inflation and by a cut - and - project scheme .",
    "mathematical quasicrystal models are studied from many perspectives , including dynamical systems , harmonic analysis , spectral theory , discrete geometry , combinatorics , and algebra ; compare @xcite .",
    "the study of electronic or quantum transport in quasicrystals , which is the perspective we take in this paper , naturally leads to the consideration of schrdinger operators with potentials modeling a quasicrystalline environment .",
    "choosing the environment given by the fibonacci tiling or sequence , this leads to the discrete one - dimensional schrdinger operator @xmath0(n ) = u(n+1 ) + u(n-1 ) + \\lambda \\chi_{[1-\\alpha,1)}(n \\alpha + \\omega \\!\\!\\!\\ !",
    "\\mod 1 ) u(n),\\ ] ] acting in @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the coupling constant , @xmath3 is the frequency , and @xmath4 is the phase . in particular",
    ", @xmath5 is the inverse of the golden ratio @xmath6 alternatively , the potential can be generated by the fibonacci substitution @xmath7 , @xmath8 ; compare @xcite .",
    "the operator family is what is usually called the fibonacci hamiltonian .",
    "it was proposed and initially studied by kohmoto et al .",
    "@xcite and by ostlund et al .",
    "@xcite , prior to the publication of @xcite , as a quasi - periodic model that can be solved exactly by renormalization group techniques .",
    "the relevance to quasicrystals was only established and discussed later .",
    "the first papers on the model in the mathematics literature belong to casdagli @xcite and st @xcite .",
    "the second reason for the extensive interest in this operator family is that it has exciting spectral properties .",
    "independently of the relevance of the model to physics , the fibonacci hamiltonian also serves as a paradigm for many spectral phenomena that had been considered exotic prior to the 1980 s .",
    "for example , it persistently displays cantor spectrum , zero - measure spectrum , purely singular continuous spectral measures , and anomalous transport . that these properties are even possible for a physically relevant model was surprising prior to discovery , and the fact that these properties can be rigorously established only adds to the importance of the model .",
    "specifically , it is often difficult to answer questions about the spectrum and the spectral type for a given schrdinger operator with an aperiodic and non - decaying potential ( periodic and decaying potentials are well understood ; compare , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) . in many cases one rather resorts to statements about members in families of operators that hold generically or with probability one .",
    "the operator families corresponding to the fibonacci and almost mathieu cases are special in that quite detailed and difficult questions about these operators can be answered for all members of the respective family .",
    "establishing this has been the objective of many publications in the past three decades focusing on these two operator families ; see , for example , the surveys @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we show that the spectrum of the fibonacci hamiltonian is a dynamically defined cantor set and that the density of states measure is exact - dimensional ; this implies that all standard fractal dimensions coincide in each case .",
    "we show that all the gaps of the spectrum allowed by the gap labeling theorem are open for all values of the coupling constant .",
    "also , we consider the optimal hlder exponent of the integrated density of states , the dimension of the density of states measure , the dimension of the spectrum , and the upper transport exponent , establish strict inequalities between them , and provide the exact large coupling asymptotics of the dimension of the density of states measure ( for the other three quantities , the large coupling asymptotics were known before ) .",
    "we also provide the explicit relations between these spectral characteristics and the dynamical properties of the fibonacci trace map ( such as dimensional characteristics of the non - wandering hyperbolic set and its measure of maximal entropy as well as other equilibrium measures , topological entropy , multipliers of periodic orbits ) .",
    "we establish exact identities relating the spectral and dynamical quantities , and show the connection between the spectral quantities and the thermodynamic pressure function .",
    "our results not just improve but complete our understanding of many spectral characteristics and properties of fibonacci hamiltonian . in the rest of the introduction we provide the exact statement of the results and discuss them in the context of previously known facts .",
    "the spectrum of the fibonacci hamiltonian @xmath9 is independent of @xmath10 and may therefore by denoted by @xmath11 .",
    "this follows from strong operator convergence and the minimality of an irrational rotation of the circle .",
    "it was shown by st in @xcite that @xmath11 is a cantor set of zero lebesgue measure for every @xmath2 .",
    "the zero - measure property in turn rules out any absolutely continuous spectrum for @xmath9 . complementing this , damanik and lenz showed that @xmath9 has no eigenvalues @xcite , and hence for all parameter values , all spectral measures are purely singular continuous .",
    "this answers the basic qualitative spectral questions about this operator family .",
    "our first result shows that actually @xmath11 is a _ dynamically defined _ cantor set , that is , it belongs to a special and heavily studied class of cantor sets that have strong self - similarity properties ( see @xcite for the formal definition and a detailed discussion of the properties of dynamically defined cantor sets ) .",
    "[ t.ddcs ] for every @xmath2 , @xmath11 is a dynamically defined cantor set . in particular , for every @xmath12 and every @xmath13 , we have @xmath14    here , @xmath15 ( resp . , @xmath16 ) denotes the hausdorff ( resp . ,",
    "box counting ) dimension of the borel set @xmath17 . stating the identities above contains the implicit assertion that the box counting dimension of the set in question exists .",
    "this result was previously known for @xmath18 @xcite and @xmath2 sufficiently small @xcite .",
    "knowing that the spectrum is a dynamically defined cantor set not only establishes the equality of all standard fractal dimensions of the set ( and shows that this common dimension is bounded away from zero and one ) , it also serves as the starting point for further studies . for example , higher - dimensional separable models may be considered and their spectra turn out to be given by the sum of the one - dimensional spectra ; compare , for example , @xcite .",
    "this leads to a study of sums of dynamically defined cantor sets , which is an extensively investigated problem about which much is known ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "given that the operator @xmath9 has purely singular continuous spectrum for all parameter values , the rage theorem ( see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  xi.115 ) ) suggests that when studying the schrdinger time evolution for this schrdinger operator , that is , @xmath19 for some initial state @xmath20 , one should consider time - averaged quantities .",
    "for simplicity , let us consider initial states of the form @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "since a translation in space simply results in an adjustment of the phase , we may without loss of generality focus on the particular case @xmath23 .",
    "the time - averaged spreading of @xmath24 is usually captured on a power - law scale as follows ; compare , for example , @xcite . for @xmath25",
    ", consider the @xmath26-th moment of the position operator , @xmath27 we average in time as follows . if @xmath28 is a function of @xmath29 and @xmath30",
    "is given , we denote the time - averaged function at @xmath31 by @xmath32 : @xmath33 then , the corresponding upper and lower transport exponents @xmath34 and @xmath35 are given , respectively , by @xmath36 @xmath37 the transport exponents @xmath38 belong to @xmath39 $ ] and are non - decreasing in @xmath26 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and hence the following limits exist : @xmath40    ballistic transport corresponds to transport exponents being equal to one , diffusive transport corresponds to the value @xmath41 , and vanishing transport exponents correspond to ( some weak form of ) dynamical localization . in all other cases ,",
    "transport is called anomalous .",
    "the fibonacci hamiltonian has long been the primary candidate for a model exhibiting anomalous transport , going back at least to the work of abe and hiramoto @xcite .",
    "many papers have been devoted to a study of the transport properties of the fibonacci hamiltonian ; see , for example , @xcite .",
    "for example , it is known that all the transport exponents defined above are strictly positive for all @xmath2 , @xmath42 ; see @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , upper bounds for all the transport exponents were shown in @xcite for @xmath43 ( see also @xcite for a somewhat weaker result ) .",
    "the exact large coupling asymptotics of @xmath44 were identified in @xcite , where is was shown that @xmath45 uniformly in @xmath42 . in particular , the fibonacci hamiltonian indeed gives rise to anomalous transport for sufficiently large coupling .",
    "the behavior in the weak coupling regime was studied in @xcite , where it was shown that there is a constant @xmath46 such that for @xmath2 sufficiently small , we have @xmath47 uniformly in @xmath42 .    while it is of clear interest to identify the asymptotic behavior of @xmath44 in the large and small coupling regimes , and in particular show that the asymptotic behavior of @xmath48 coincides with that of @xmath49 , the following questions remain .",
    "what can we say for a given value of @xmath50 ? can we for example give an explicit expression for @xmath48 or @xmath49 ?",
    "can we even show that @xmath48 and @xmath49 coincide for the given value of @xmath50 ( and @xmath10 ) ?",
    "we will address these questions in this paper .",
    "an explicit description of @xmath44 will be given in theorem  [ t.identities ] stated later in this introduction ( it will require the trace map formalism , which will be recalled in subsection  [ ss.tracemap ] ) . a particular consequence of the description given",
    "there is that the desired identity holds :    [ t.equaltransportexponents ] for every @xmath2 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are equal and independent of @xmath42 .",
    "the interpretation of this statement is that , for all values of the coupling constant and the phase , the fastest part of the wavepacket travels uniformly on a power - law scale .",
    "that is , there are nt two different sequences of time scales along which the `` front of the wavepacket '' moves at two different power - law rates .",
    "to the best of our knowledge this is the first time this phenomenon has been rigorously established for a model for which @xmath51 and @xmath52 take fractional values .",
    "the reason for this is that it is usually very difficult to identify transport exponents exactly ( if they take fractional values ) and hence most results only establish estimates for them .",
    "let us recall the definition of the density of states measure and some derived quantities . by the spectral theorem ,",
    "there are borel probability measures @xmath53 on @xmath54 such that @xmath55 for all bounded measurable functions @xmath56 .",
    "the _ density of states measure _ @xmath57 is given by the @xmath10-average of these measures with respect to lebesgue measure , that is , @xmath58 for all bounded measurable functions @xmath56 . by general principles ,",
    "the density of states measure is non - atomic and its topological support is @xmath11 .",
    "the fact that @xmath11 has zero lebesgue measure therefore implies that @xmath57 is singular continuous for every @xmath2 .",
    "the density of states measure can also be obtained by counting the number of eigenvalues per unit volume , in a given energy region , of restrictions of the operator to finite intervals ( which explains the terminology ) .",

    "for definiteness , @xmath61}$ ] is defined with dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "we will be interested in the optimal hlder exponent @xmath62 of @xmath57 .",
    "that is , @xmath62 is the unique number in @xmath39 $ ] such that the following two properties hold .    1 .   for any @xmath63 and any sufficiently small interval @xmath64 ,",
    "we have @xmath65 ; 2 .   for any @xmath66 and any @xmath13",
    ", there exists an interval @xmath64 such that @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the optimal hlder exponent of the density of states measure is studied for other popular discrete schrdinger operators in numerous papers ; see , for example , @xcite and references therein . for the fibonacci case in the regime of small or large coupling , it was studied in @xcite . in particular , it was shown that @xmath69 as @xmath70 and @xmath71 as @xmath72 ( the explicit rate at which it does so is recalled in theorem  [ t.asymptotics ] below ) . in",
    "all these works only estimates and asymptotics for the optimal hlder exponent were established . in this paper , we will express the optimal hlder exponent in the fibonacci case explicitly , for any value of the coupling constant , in terms of dynamical quantities related to the fibonacci trace map ( the explicit formula is provided in theorem [ t.identities ] below ) . for small values of the coupling constant @xmath50",
    ", this will allow us to give an exact formula for @xmath62 as a function of @xmath50 ; see corollary  [ c.holderexp ] .",
    "the distribution function of the density of states measure is called the integrated density of states and denoted by @xmath73 .",
    "thus , for @xmath74 , we have @xmath75 } \\ , d\\nu_\\lambda = \\lim_{l \\to \\infty } \\frac{1}{l } \\ # \\big\\ { \\text{eigenvalues of } h_{\\lambda,\\omega}|_{[1,l ] } \\text { that are } \\le e \\big\\},\\ ] ] uniformly in @xmath10 .",
    "since @xmath11 is the topological support of @xmath57 , it follows that @xmath73 is constant on each gap of @xmath11 , where any connected component of @xmath76 is called a gap of @xmath11 .",
    "this value may be used as the label of the gap in question . the gap labeling theorem ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) provides a set that is defined purely in terms of the underlying dynamical system generating the ergodic family of potentials in question ( in our case this is either the irrational rotation of the circle by the ( inverse of the ) golden ratio , or the shift transformation on the subshift generated by the fibonacci substitution ) , to which all gap labels must belong .",
    "this general gap labeling theorem specializes in the fibonacci case to the following statement ( see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq .  ( 6.7 ) ) ) : @xmath77 for every @xmath2 .",
    "here @xmath78 denotes the fractional part of @xmath79 , that is , @xmath80 .",
    "notice that the set of possible gap labels is indeed @xmath50-independent and only depends on the value of @xmath81 from the underlying circle rotation . since @xmath81 is irrational , the set of gap labels is dense",
    ".    in general , a dense set of possible gap labels is indicative of a cantor spectrum and hence a common ( and attractive ) stronger version of proving cantor spectrum is to show that the operator `` has all its gaps open . '' for example , the ten martini problem for the almost mathieu operator is to show cantor spectrum , while the dry ten martini problem is to show that all labels correspond to gaps in the spectrum . the former problem has been completely solved @xcite , while the latter has not yet been completely settled ( it remains open for the case of critical coupling and non - liouville frequency ; see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "indeed , it is in general a hard problem to show that all labels given by the gap labeling theorem correspond to gaps and there are only few results of this kind .",
    "here we show the stronger ( or `` dry '' ) form of cantor spectrum for the fibonacci hamiltonian and establish complete gap labeling :    [ t.completegaplabeling ] for every @xmath2 , all gaps allowed by the gap labeling theorem are open .",
    "that is , @xmath82    raymond proved for @xmath83 @xcite and damanik and gorodetski proved for @xmath2 sufficiently small @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was also shown that all gaps open linearly as the coupling constant is turned on .",
    "it was conjectured in @xcite that holds for every @xmath2 , and theorem  [ t.completegaplabeling ] proves this conjecture .",
    "our next result concerns the exact - dimensionality of the density of states measure for every value of the coupling constant .",
    "[ t.doesexactdim ] for every @xmath2 , the density of states measure @xmath57 is exact - dimensional .",
    "namely , for every @xmath2 , the limit ( called the scaling exponent of @xmath57 at @xmath84 ) @xmath85 @xmath57-almost everywhere exists and is constant .    in @xcite damanik and gorodetski had shown the exact - dimensionality of @xmath57 for @xmath2 sufficiently small .",
    "a particular consequence of the exact - dimensionality of @xmath57 is that virtually all the known characteristics of dimension type of the measure coincide . in particular",
    ", the following four dimensions associated with the measure @xmath57 , those most relevant to quantum dynamics , coincide ( namely with the almost everywhere value of the limit above ) : @xmath86 here , @xmath87 denotes the packing dimension of the borel set @xmath17 .",
    "these four dimensions are called the upper and lower hausdorff dimension and the upper and lower packing dimension of @xmath57 , respectively ; compare ; for example , @xcite .      there is a fundamental connection between the spectral properties of the fibonacci hamiltonian and the dynamics of the _ trace map _ @xmath88 the function @xmath89 is invariant under the action of @xmath31 , and hence @xmath31 preserves the family of cubic surfaces is known as cayley cubic . ]",
    "@xmath90 it is therefore natural to consider the restriction @xmath91 of the trace map @xmath31 to the invariant surface @xmath92",
    ". that is , @xmath93 , @xmath94 .",
    "we denote by @xmath95 the set of points in @xmath92 whose full orbits under @xmath91 are bounded ( it is known that @xmath96 is equal to the non - wandering set of @xmath97 ; see ) .",
    "denote by @xmath98 the line @xmath99 it is easy to check that @xmath100 .",
    "the key to the fundamental connection between the spectral properties of the fibonacci hamiltonian and the dynamics of the trace map is the following result of st @xcite .",
    "an energy @xmath74 belongs to the spectrum @xmath11 of the fibonacci hamiltonian if and only if the positive semiorbit of the point @xmath101 under iterates of the trace map @xmath31 is bounded .",
    "this connection shows that spectral properties of the fibonacci hamiltonian can be studied via an analysis of the dynamics of the trace map .",
    "another very important ingredient is the following .",
    "for every @xmath2 , @xmath96 is a locally maximal compact transitive hyperbolic set of @xmath102 ; see @xcite .",
    "this fact allows one to use powerful tools from hyperbolic dynamics in exploring the connection between the operator and the trace map .",
    "actually , this realization is the driving force behind all of the recent advances ( roughly those dating back to 2008 , starting with @xcite ) . to fully exploit this",
    ", one needs that the stable manifolds of points in @xmath96 intersect the line of initial conditions , @xmath98 , transversally .",
    "this crucial fact was known for @xmath50 sufficiently large @xcite or sufficiently small @xcite , but open in the intermediate regime . as a consequence ,",
    "many of the recent results could only be shown in the regimes of small and large coupling .",
    "[ t.transversal ] for every @xmath2 , @xmath98 intersects @xmath103 transversally .    here",
    ", @xmath98 denotes the line of initial conditions given in and @xmath103 denotes the collection of stable manifold of points in the locally maximal compact transitive hyperbolic set @xmath96 of @xmath102 .",
    "theorems  [ t.ddcs ] , [ t.completegaplabeling ] , and [ t.doesexactdim ] are consequences of theorem  [ t.transversal ] .",
    "in fact , each of the statements in theorems  [ t.ddcs ] , [ t.completegaplabeling ] , and [ t.doesexactdim ] was previously known for @xmath2 sufficiently small @xcite ; but more precisely , these statements were shown in each case to hold for all values of the coupling constant between zero and the specific value where a breakdown of transversality first occurs ( or @xmath104 if no such value exists ) . since transversality is easily seen to hold for @xmath2 sufficiently small @xcite",
    ", one could derive the desired statements unconditionally in the small coupling regime .",
    "for this reason , proving the absence of a breakdown of transversality had been one of the major goals in the study of the fibonacci hamiltonian , and theorem  [ t.transversal ] finally accomplishes this goal .",
    "it is interesting to note that the proof of theorem  [ t.transversal ] is not a straightforward construction of an invariant cone field but rather uses the fact that the trace map is polynomial as well as spectral arguments ( the fact that @xmath11 does not have isolated points ) .",
    "recall that we are primarily interested in the following four quantities associated with the fibonacci hamiltonian : the upper transport exponents @xmath105 , the dimension of the spectrum @xmath106 , the dimension of the density of states measure @xmath107 , and the optimal hlder exponent of the integrated density of states @xmath62 .",

    "while we have focused up to this point on the classical fibonacci hamiltonian , much of what we do extends either partly or fully to other types of operators . also , we strongly believe that the results presented here provide an insight toward and an opportunity to approach some other more complicated models as well . in this section",
    "we briefly address some of these extensions and generalizations .    *",
    "* the off - diagonal model . * in the present paper we consider the fibonacci hamiltonian in the form , which is usually called the _ diagonal model _ and which is the one most popular in the mathematics literature . in the physics literature the so - called off - diagonal model is usually considered .",
    "the spectral properties of the off - diagonal operator as well as the relation to the dynamics of the fibonacci trace map are not any different from the diagonal one ; see the appendix in @xcite for a detailed discussion of the off - diagonal model .",
    "all the results presented in this paper for the diagonal model also hold for the off - diagonal one . * * potentials generated by primitive invertible substitutions . *",
    "discrete schrdinger operators with potentials generated by primitive invertible substitutions have spectral properties that are very much similar to the spectral properties of the fibonacci hamiltonian .",
    "for some of the spectral properties this was justified in @xcite .",
    "we expect that all the qualitative statements ( i.e. , all the statements mentioned in the introduction except corollary  [ c.alphalowerbounds ] and theorem  [ t.asymptotics ] ) of this paper can be generalized to this case also .",
    "as for the large coupling asymptotics , the calculations can be more complicated , but can likely be carried out for particular potentials ( given the results obtained in @xcite ) . *",
    "* sturmian potentials .",
    "* sturmian potentials are natural generalizations of the fibonacci potential .",
    "namely , one simply replaces the specific value of @xmath5 in by a general irrational @xmath913 .",
    "it is known that the spectrum of a discrete schrdinger operator with a sturmian potential is a cantor set of zero measure @xcite , but in most cases this cantor set will not be dynamically defined @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , there is a dynamical presentation of the spectrum in this case as well @xcite , and it would be interesting to see whether the dynamical approach can add something to the recent results in @xcite that were obtained via the periodic approximation technique . * * jacobi matrices . *",
    "in general , discrete schrdinger operators form a particular case of the operators given by jacobi matrices . in the case where the coefficients of a jacobi matrix are modulated by the fibonacci sequence ,",
    "their spectral properties were studied in @xcite .",
    "interestingly enough , the spectrum in this case does not have to be dynamically defined .",
    "nevertheless , the relation to the dynamics of the fibonacci trace map allows one to give a detailed description of the spectrum in this case , at least in some regimes , and our results can be used to provide a complete description throughout the entire parameter space . *",
    "* cmv matrices . *",
    "cmv matrices are the unitary analog of jacobi matrices .",
    "that is , they are canonical models of unitary operators ( just as jacobi matrices are canonical models of self - adjoint operators ) and they arise naturally in the study of orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle ( while jacobi matrices arise in the study of orthogonal polynomials on the real line ) ; compare @xcite .",
    "in addition , cmv matrices have been effectively used to study quantum walks and the ising model in one dimension ; see @xcite . choosing the coefficients defining a cmv matrix according to the fibonacci sequence one obtains an interesting model that can be studied using the trace map formalism as well .",
    "several results for this model were obtained in @xcite , both from the perspective of orthogonal polynomials and the perspective of quantum walks and the ising model .",
    "the results and tools developed in the present paper will allow one to take the analysis of the cmv case further .",
    "* * continuum models . *",
    "continuum schrdinger operators with fibonacci - type potentials were considered in @xcite . in this case",
    "there are many models ( depending on the choice of single - site potentials ) .",
    "the trace map description of the spectrum is also available in this case ( see @xcite ) , and hence it is reasonable to expect that our results can be used . *",
    "* higher - dimensional separable models . * understanding the spectral properties of the operators associated with the standard two- and three - dimensional quasicrystal models is a major problem in the field which is currently out of reach .",
    "one of the ways to get some insight into the problem is to consider operators with separable potentials ; for example , the square ( and cubic ) fibonacci hamiltonian and the labyrinth model @xcite . in these models the spectrum of the higher dimensional operator is the sum ( or product ) of the spectra of the one dimensional ones . since studying the sum of dynamically defined cantor sets is a classical problem which has been extensively studied ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) , we expect that the current results will be instrumental in understanding the spectral properties of separable models .",
    "there is recent work on these models that relies on the one - dimensional results in the small and large coupling regimes @xcite , and the results of this paper will pave the way for a study of separable models that does not rely on the small and large coupling theory .",
    "we are grateful to katrin gelfert who explained to us how to use the thermodynamical formalism to prove proposition  [ p.main1 ] , and to eric bedford , tanya firsova , yulij ilyashenko , and mikhail lyubich for useful discussions on polynomial dynamics .",
