    "it is generally believed that vortices in type ii superconductors tend to be pinned in regions where the gap is small  @xcite .",
    "this is true because a vortex , being a region where the gradient of the superconducting order parameter is large , locally increases the gradient part of the free energy .",
    "since this local increase is less in regions where the gap is smaller than average , the vortex tends to migrate to such regions , according to this picture .    in this paper",
    ", we describe a simple model for vortex pinning in an inhomogeneous two - dimensional ( 2d ) superconductor , in which the vortices tend to be pinned in regions where the gap is _ larger _ than its spatial average .",
    "the model is based on a ginzburg - landau ( gl ) free energy functional in which both the mean - field transition temperature @xmath0 and the zero - temperature penetration depth @xmath1 are functions of position , but are correlated in such a way that regions with large @xmath0 also have large @xmath1 .",
    "this assumption seems to apply to some of the high - t@xmath9 cuprate superconductors : according to scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) experiments on cuprates  @xcite , regions that have a large gap ( proportional to @xmath0 in this model ) also have a single - particle local density of states ( ldos ) with low , broad peaks , suggestive of a low superfluid density in these regions [ proportional to @xmath10 .",
    "our model is a generalization of an earlier approach intended to treat inhomogeneous superconductors in zero magnetic field@xcite .    in order to further test this vortex pinning model",
    ", we also examine the quasiparticle ldos near the vortex cores within this model .",
    "the proper theoretical description of this ldos near the cores is one of the unsolved issues in the field of high - t@xmath9 superconductivity .",
    "stm experiments on yba@xmath5cu@xmath6o@xmath7 ( ybco ) @xcite and bi@xmath5sr@xmath5cacu@xmath5o@xmath8 ( bi2212 ) @xcite , show that the local density of states ( ldos ) near vortex cores in those materials has the following characteristics : a dip at zero energy , small peaks at energies smaller than the superconducting gap , and low , broad peaks at energies above the superconducting gap .",
    "those features contrast with the spectra shown by conventional superconductors near vortex cores , where the ldos usually has a peak at zero energy in clean superconductors ( i.e. , those with a mean - free path larger than the coherence length ) @xcite , or is nearly energy - independent in dirty superconductors @xcite .",
    "the zero - energy peak in the ldos near vortex cores of clean conventional superconductors can be understood in terms of electronic states with subgap energies bound to vortex cores @xcite .",
    "however , the structure of the spectra near vortex cores of cuprates is still lacking an explanation .",
    "several authors have suggested that this structure is due to some type of competing order which emerges within the vortex cores when superconductivity is suppressed by a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "some of those models , and other descriptions of the spectra near vortex cores , have used the bogoliubov - de gennes method to solve various microscopic hamiltonians @xcite , such as bcs - like models with d - wave symmetry .",
    "one recent model for the ldos near the vortex cores , proposed by melikyan and tesanovic@xcite , used a bogoliubov - de gennes approach to a tight - binding hamiltonian .",
    "these authors found that , if a homogeneous pairing field is used in the microscopic hamiltonian , the ldos exhibits a zero - energy peak on the atomic sites that are closest to the vortex cores ; this peak is , however , absent from all other sites near the vortex cores . on the other hand , they found that introducing an enhanced pairing strength for electrons on nearest - neighbor atomic sites near the vortex cores leads to a suppression of the zero energy peak , thus obtaining a better agreement with experiment .",
    "they speculate that the enhancement could be due to impurity atoms that pin the vortices , to a distortion of the atomic lattice by the vortex itself , or to quantum fluctuations of the superconducting order parameter .",
    "the assumption of an enhanced pairing strength is consistent with the model that we describe in this paper . in our model ,",
    "having introduced this correlation between the gl parameters , we anneal the system to find both the magnitude and the phase of the superconducting order parameter that minimize the gl free energy at low temperatures . since the magnetic vector potential enters the gl free energy functional , this procedure naturally leads to vortex formation .",
    "the vortex cores can be identified in our simulations as regions with a large phase gradient .",
    "we find that , in inhomogeneous systems , vortices tend to be pinned in regions where the superconducting gap is large . for comparison",
    ", we also perform a similar annealing procedure for homogeneous systems . in this case , contrary to inhomogeneous systems , the magnitude of the superconducting order parameter is reduced near vortex cores . thus , the assumption that the gap is large in regions with small superfluid density in inhomogeneous systems , originally intended to model superconductors in a zero magnetic field @xcite , leads naturally to pinning of the vortices in large - gap regions .",
    "this approach might therefore be complementary to that of ref .",
    "@xcite mentioned above . to connect our vortex pinning model to previous studies of the ldos near vortex cores ,",
    "we have also studied a microscopic hamiltonian for electrons on a lattice .",
    "this is a tight - binding model in which electrons on nearest neighbor sites experience a pairing interaction of the bcs type with d - wave symmetry @xcite .",
    "the ldos is obtained by exact numerical diagonalization of this hamiltonian .",
    "we take the pairing stregth between electrons on nearest neighbor sites to be proportional to the value of the superconducting order parameter as determined by the gl simulations using the gl functional just described . using this combination of a gl free energy functional and a microscopic d - wave bcs hamiltonian",
    ", we find that a number of experimental results on cuprates are reproduced well by our model for inhomogeneous systems .",
    "for example , far from vortex cores , the ldos shows sharp coherence peaks .",
    "near the vortex cores , our calculated ldos does not show a spurious zero energy peak ; instead it exhibits a large gap , as well as low , broad peaks which occur at energies larger than the value of the superconducting energy gap observed far from vortex cores .",
    "also , in agreement with experiment , the ldos curves near vortex cores are similar to those in the large gap regions in systems with quenched disorder but _ zero _ magnetic field@xcite ) ; this connection is discussed in section [ results ] .",
    "one feature not captured by our model is the existence of small , low energy peaks in the ldos observed near the vortex cores .",
    "the rest of the present article is organized as follows . in section [ model ] , we present the gl free energy functional , as well the microscopic hamiltonian . in section [ results ] , we present results for homogeneous and inhomogeneous systems in a magnetic field , as well as results for inhomogeneous systems in a zero magnetic field for comparison . finally , in section [ discussion",
    "] , we conclude with a discussion and a summary of our work .",
    "we use a model for a single layer of a cuprate superconductor in a perpendicular magnetic field based on a gl free energy functional of the form described previously@xcite : @xmath11 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : glgeneral4 ] ) the first and second sums are carried over @xmath12 square cells , each of area equal to the zero - temperature gl coherence length squared , @xmath13 , of a square lattice into which the superconductor has been discretized for computational purposes .",
    "the third sum is carried out over nearest neighbor cells @xmath14 .",
    "here @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the complex superconducting order parameter of the i@xmath17 cell , @xmath18 is an arbitrary energy scale ( which we take to be the hopping constant @xmath19 mev ) @xmath20 is the reduced temperature , @xmath21 is the temperature , and @xmath22 is the boltzmann constant . also , @xmath23 is the @xmath24 penetration depth and @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the mean - field transition temperature of the i@xmath17 cell .",
    "therefore , in discretizing the superconductor , we have assumed that @xmath1 , @xmath0 and @xmath4 are constant over distances of order @xmath27 . finally , @xmath28 is the integral of the vector potential @xmath29 from the center of cell @xmath30 , located at @xmath31 , to the center of cell @xmath32 , located at @xmath33 , and @xmath34 $ ] , where @xmath35 ev - @xmath36 is the square of the bohr magneton , @xmath37 is twice the mass of a free electron , @xmath38 is the absolute value of its charge , and @xmath39 is the thickness of the superconducting layer . in all of our simulations",
    "we use periodic boundary conditions . a gauge for the magnetic field that allows this",
    "is given in ref .",
    "@xcite [ see , e.  g. , eq .  ( 51 ) of ref.@xcite , which gives this gauge choice explicitly for @xmath40 .",
    "we note that the connection between the local superfluid density @xmath41 and penetration depth @xmath42 is such that @xmath43  @xcite .",
    "thus , the quantity @xmath44 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) is a way of describing the local superfluid density , which varies over a length scale of @xmath45 .",
    "we will be using the above free energy functional at both @xmath24 and finite @xmath21 .",
    "although we call this a `` ginzburg - landau free energy functional , '' this name is really a misnomer , since the original gl functional was intended to be applicable only near the mean - field transition temperature . strictly speaking ,",
    "the correct free energy functional near @xmath24 should not have the gl form , but would be expected to contain additional terms , such as higher powers of @xmath46 .",
    "we use the gl form for convenience , and because we expect it will exhibit the qualitative behavior , such as vortex pinning in the large - gap regions , that would be seen in a more accurate functional .",
    "we assume that the magnetic field is uniform , which is a good approximation for cuprate superconductors in their mixed state , provided the external field is not too close to the lower critical field @xmath47 . in the cuprates ,",
    "the approximation is satisfactory because the penetration depth is of the order of thousands of  , while the intervortex distance for the fields we consider is @xmath48   .",
    "we employ a gauge that permits periodic boundary conditions , such that the flux through the lattice can take any integer multiple of @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "thus , the number @xmath50 of flux quanta @xmath51 must be an integer multiple of two .",
    "the procedure for choosing the parameters @xmath23 and @xmath52 is similar to that used in ref .",
    "basically , in most of the system ( @xmath53 regions ) , we take @xmath54 , where @xmath1 is the in - plane penetration depth of a bulk cuprate superconductor [ @xmath55    in bi2212 , for example ] , while @xmath52 is determined from the typical energy gap in the ldos as observed in stm experiments .",
    "however , we will also introduce regions ( @xmath56 regions ) in which @xmath57 and @xmath1 are larger than those bulk values . throughout this article ,",
    "when we refer to a `` gap in the ldos , '' we mean the distance between the two peaks in the ldos spectra .",
    "this is the same gap definition used in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we generally introduced inhomogeneities in the superconducting order parameter @xmath58 by assuming a binary distribution of @xmath59 , randomly distributed in space : @xmath53 cells with a small @xmath59 and @xmath56 cells with a large @xmath59",
    ". we also assumed a correlation between @xmath23 and @xmath52 of the form @xmath60 with @xmath61 .",
    "more generally , eq .  ( [ eq : lambda2_correl ] ) , with @xmath3 , accounts for the fact that in stm experiments , regions with a large gap seem to have a small superfluid density ( low and broad peaks . )    in the present article , instead of randomly distributed @xmath56 cells , we introduce two square regions with only @xmath56 cells , while the rest of the lattice is assumed to have only @xmath53 cells .",
    "we make this choice to study the effects of these inhomogeneities on field - induced vortices .",
    "we also consider a more general model than ref .",
    "@xcite , allowing @xmath62 to have values other than only @xmath63 .    as shown in eq .",

    "besides using a gl free energy to explore vortex pinning in an inhomogeneous superconductor , we have also studied the ldos of a corresponding microscopic model hamiltonian , given by  @xcite : @xmath74 here @xmath75 denotes a sum over distinct pairs of nearest neighbor atomic sites on a square lattice with @xmath76 sites , @xmath77 creates an electron with spin @xmath78 ( @xmath79 or @xmath80 ) at site @xmath32 , @xmath81 is the chemical potential , and @xmath82 denotes the strength of the pairing interaction between electrons at sites @xmath30 and @xmath32 .",

    "note that the prefactor in @xmath88 involves the factor of @xmath49 due to a single electronic charge , and is thus twice as large as that in @xmath89 , which involves the charge of a cooper pair .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite we take @xmath82 to be given by @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 is the value of the complex superconducting order parameter at site @xmath32 .",

    "the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamil_bcs ] ) thus corresponds to the kinetic energy , the second term is a bcs type of pairing interaction with @xmath39-wave symmetry , and the third is the energy associated with the chemical potential .",
    "the model we present is similar to the one presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , the main differences being the inclusion of a vector potential in the gl free energy functional , and the spatial distribution of the inhomogeneities .",
    "because the vector potential introduces vortices in the system , our results differ substantially from our previous work .",
    "we first present results for homogeneous systems in the presence of an applied transverse magnetic field equal to two flux quanta through the lattice at low @xmath21 .",

    "if @xmath123 , then the vortices are consistently pinned in the large gap region . by contrast , if @xmath63 , we find the vortices may or may not be pinned in the large gap region , depending on where these regions are located within the computational lattice .",
    "the vortices obviously go to the large gap region because of the correlation between @xmath124 and @xmath0 .",
    "as mentioned earlier , this correlation originates in the fact large @xmath124 implies a small energy cost to introduce a gradient in the phase of the order parameter .",
    "such a gradient must exist near a vortex core ; therefore , the vortex prefers to be in a region where this gradient is energetically inexpensive .",

    "we have also looked at how the size of the pinning regions affects the pinning .",
    "the pinning is generally more effective for large pinning regions , probably because the vortex energy is reduced by a larger amount if pinned in a region of large pinning area , all other parameters being the same .",
    "finally , we note the similarity between our calculated ldos versus energy curves for regions near the vortex cores , and the corresponding curves for large gap regions of inhomogeneous systems with quenched disorder in a _",
    "zero _ magnetic field , calculated in our previous work @xcite .",
    "those similarities have been implied in several experimental papers .",
    "for example , lang _",
    "et al._@xcite discussed the similarity between the spectra of large - gap regions of inhomogeneous systems at low temperatures in a zero field and those observed in the pseudogap regime of some cuprate superconductors . in the pseudogap region ,",
    "the phase configuration is disordered and therefore , possibly like the @xmath56 region at zero field , both might be considered as `` normal '' regions .",
    "likewise , fischer _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have also noted the similarity of the low-@xmath21 spectra near the vortex cores to spectra in the pseudogap regime .",
    "once again , the similarity may arise because both the interior of the vortex cores and the pseudogap region may be considered as `` normal '' .",
    "thus , both of these reports implicitly suggest a similarity between the low-@xmath21 spectra in the large gap regions of a disordered system at @xmath116 and the corresponding spectra near vortex cores at finite @xmath125 .",
    "we have presented a model for the pinning of vortices by inhomogeneities in a two - dimensional type ii superconductor at low temperatures .",
    "the model is based on a gl free energy functional , and it is inspired by our previous study @xcite of the ldos in an inhomogeneous superconductor in zero magnetic field . in our model , we have proposed a gl free energy functional in which regions with a large value of the superconducting order parameter have a large penetration depth , as suggested by zero - field stm experiments on cuprates .",
    "using an annealing process and monte carlo simulations , we have found that the pinning of vortices by those large - gap regions emerges naturally from the functional form of our gl free energy .",
    "the vortices are attracted to the large - gap regions , in our model , because the large penetration depth leads to a small coupling between cells in those regions .",
    "therefore , the phase of the superconducting order parameter can more easily bend in these regions , and this in turn allows the large - gap regions to accomodate a vortex more easily than regions with a small gap .",
    "by contrast , in the absence of quenched inhomogeneities , minimization of the gl free energy functional yields a spatial configuration in which the superconducting order parameter is suppressed near vortex cores .",
    "it is worth commenting further on the qualitative physics underlying the pinning of the vortices in the region of enhanced local @xmath126 .",
    "basically , this pinning behavior occurs because , in our model , a locally enhanced tc corresponds to a locally suppressed superfluid density .",
    "this superfluid density is proportional to the local @xmath44 , and is related to the ginzburg - landau coefficients , as we have described earlier .",
    "the vortices can be more easily accommodated in these large-@xmath126 regions because the large phase gradients which characterize the vortices cost less energy in such regions .",
    "although we describe the pinning in terms of the variation of @xmath44 , the pinning is not due to any kind of `` magnetic '' forces - the quantity @xmath44 is just a way of describing the local superfluid density .",
    "thus , just as in conventional pinning , the vortices are attracted to regions of lower free energy .",
    "the major difference is that the superfluid density ( and @xmath44 ) is proportional to @xmath126 in the present model , rather than being independent of , or inversely correlated with @xmath126 as in more conventional pinning .",
    "this leads to pinning in a large-@xmath126 region rather than a small-@xmath126 region .",
    "we also emphasize that , although our pinning results are obtained using rather elaborate numerical calculations , the underlying physics is straightforward : the pinning behavior is consistent with qualitative expectations , given the model .",
    "it may seem strange to consider the spatial variation in @xmath44 as occurring over a scale of @xmath127 , when @xmath128 itself is of order @xmath129 @xmath130 or more .",
    "however , it should be remembered that @xmath44 is related to the coefficients of the ginzburg - landau free energy [ see eq .",
    "( 1 ) ] , and these coefficients are , in fact , expected to vary over a scale of @xmath45 .",
    "thus , the model is , indeed , reasonable and consistent with the expected physics .",
    "it is the local superfluid density ( proportional to @xmath44 ) which varies over a scale of @xmath45 .",
    "it is also worth commenting on what kind of real systems could be described by our model .",
    "even if one neglects the weak josephson coupling between the layers of a high - t@xmath9 material , there will still be magnetic interactions between pancake vortices in adjacent layers , so that the system will not be truly 2d . likewise , if we wish to use this model to describe a very thin 2d high - t@xmath9 film , there are stray fields in vacuum extending into the third dimension , which will contribute to the total energy . in both cases ,",
    "our model is definitely an oversimplification .",
    "nonetheless , our model does seem to describe some observed features in real high - t@xmath9 materials , suggesting that it captures some significant physics in these systems .",
    "thus , we consider our model as a possible starting point for a fully realistic treatment of either 3d high - t@xmath9 materials or very thin 2d high - t@xmath9 layers .    we have connected our work on the pinning of vortices to continuing efforts by several groups to describe the density of states near vortices in cuprates superconductors . to do this ,",
    "we have studied a model bcs hamiltonian with d - wave symmetry , in which the pairing field is obtained from simulations of the gl free energy functional .",
    "we use exact diagonalization to compute the local density of states on each atomic site of the lattice described by this hamiltonian . for homogeneous systems",
    ", we found that the ldos near the vortex cores resembles that of a gapless tight - binding model in two dimensions , with a van hove peak at zero energy .",
    "however , when we introduce the inhomogeneities with a large pairing field and large penetration depth that pin the vortices , the ldos near the vortex cores is markedly different from that of the homogeneous systems .",
    "namely , this ldos exhibits a large gap as well as low and broadened peaks at energies greater than that of the superconducting gap fa.r from the vortex core .",
    "also , our calculated ldos near the vortex cores in this inhomogeneous case does not exhibit the spurious zero - energy peak which is present in several other theoretical studies but is absent from experiments .",
    "all of these features in our calculations are consistent with results observed in stm experiments on ybco @xcite and bi2212 @xcite .",
    "our results are also consistent with those obtained of ref .",
    "@xcite , using a somewhat different model .",
    "those authors obtain better agreement between their calculated ldos spectra and experiment@xcite , if they assume an enhanced rather than uniform pairing field near the vortex cores . in particular , introducing this large pairing field near the vortex core in their model suppresses the unphysical zero - energy peak .",
    "our approach , in which a large gap is correlated with a large penetration depth , may heop justify the occurrence of this larger pairing field in the vortex cores .    finally , we briefly comment on the possible physical origin of correlation between large gap and large penetration depth .",
    "the origin of the spatial fluctuations of @xmath0 observed in the cuprates may be the local fluctuations in concentration , which are highly likely since the cuprates are mostly disordered alloys and the local concentration would involve an average a coherence length , which is only about 15 @xmath130 . but @xmath0 is proportional to the gap ( i.  e. , presumably , the pseudogap ) , which increases with decreasing concentration of charge carriers , whereas @xmath131 is proportional to the superfluid density , which should decrease with decreasing charge carrier concentration .",
    "therefore , we expect @xmath0 to be positively correlated with @xmath132 , as seen experimentally and as used in the present model .",
    "this work was supported by nsf grant dmr04 - 13395 . the computations described here",
    "were carried out through a grant of computing time from the ohio supercomputer center .",
