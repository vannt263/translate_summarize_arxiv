    "it is now well established that the quantum state of light can be measured .",
    "the first experimental evidence of this @xcite followed the work of vogel and risken @xcite , where it was shown that the wigner function could be reconstructed from a complete ensemble of measured quadrature amplitude distributions .",
    "the authors of @xcite measured the quadrature distributions using balanced homodyne techniques . in the case of inefficient homodyne detectors ,",
    "a more general s - parameterized quasiprobability distribution is obtained resulting in a smoothed wigner function . in either case , to obtain the quasiprobability phase space distribution from the measured data a rather complicated inverse transformation is required .",
    "novel techniques which avoid this transformation are aimed at measuring the quasiprobability distribution more directly .",
    "this can be achieved , for example , in unbalanced homodyne counting experiments @xcite , where a weighted sum of photocount statistics are combined to obtain a single point in the phase space distribution .",
    "the entire distribution is then obtained by scanning the magnitude and phase of the local oscillator over the region of interest while repeating the photon counting at each point .",
    "perhaps the most direct method of obtaining a quasiprobability distribution is to use heterodyne @xcite or double homodyne @xcite detection techniques where the @xmath0 function is measured .",
    "the @xmath0 function is related to the wigner function through a convolution with a gaussian distribution which effectively washes out many of the interesting quantum features .",
    "it is possible to recover these features by deconvoluting the @xmath0 function , however this requires multiplying by an exponentially increasing function thereby introducing a crucial dependence on sampling noise @xcite .",
    "other non - tomographic state reconstruction schemes are proposed in @xcite for fields in a cavity , in @xcite for trapped atoms and in @xcite where use of a schrdinger - cat state probe is suggested .",
    "further discussion of such techniques can be found in the recent review by welsch and vogel @xcite , the book by leonhardt @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "a different approach has been suggested by steuernagel and vaccaro @xcite , who have proposed an interesting nonrecursive scheme to measure not the quasiprobability distribution , but rather the density operator in the photon number basis .",
    "the scheme is relatively direct in that only a finite number of different measurements are required to determine each matrix element .",
    "however , the major disadvantage of this scheme is that determination of each matrix element , @xmath1 , requires the preparation of a two - state superposition of @xmath2 and @xmath3 for use as a probe field .",
    "not only has the preparation of such fields not yet been achieved , but also the experiment requires a change of the probe field for the measurement of each matrix element .",
    "in this paper we investigate an alternative non - recursive scheme to that of steuernagel and vaccaro that also measures the individual density matrix elements in the photon number basis .",
    "remarkably we find that this can be achieved with a single reference field that can be in an easily prepared coherent state .",
    "the only changes to the reference field needed to measure all the matrix elements are simple phase shifts .",
    "the integral transformation required in the tomographic technique is avoided and is replaced by a summation of only four easily measurable probabilities .",
    "we find that this technique is particulary suited for measurements of low intensity states , such as that used in @xcite , where it offers some simplifications over the tomographic methods .",
    "the density matrix element @xmath1 in the number state representation of a density operator @xmath4 is given by @xmath5 this can be compared with the probability for an outcome event @xmath6 of a measurement on a system in state @xmath4 , which is given from general quantum measurement theory @xcite by @xmath7,\\label{2a}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the element of a probability operator measure ( pom ) associated with the event @xmath6 . comparing ( [ 1a ] ) and ( [ 2a ] ) suggests that if we could find a pom element equal to the operator @xmath9 then we could find the matrix element @xmath1 simply by measuring the probability @xmath10 .",
    "this of course is not possible as the probability must be between zero and one but the matrix element need not even be real .",
    "however if we could synthesize the operator @xmath9 by a linear combination of different pom elements then we could find the matrix element from the same linear combination of the associated measurable probabilities .",
    "we adopt this _ operator synthesis _ approach in this paper .     and",
    "@xmath11 of bs1 and bs2 respectively .",
    "a vacuum is in the input mode @xmath12 and photon counters are in the output modes .",
    "phase shifter ps adjusts the phase of the coherent state.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    the proposed measurement technique uses the arrangement shown in fig .",
    "it consists of two symmetric beam splitters labelled bs1 with input modes @xmath12 and @xmath13 and bs2 with input modes @xmath12 and @xmath11 .",
    "bs2 is a 50/50 beam splitter but we keep the transmission to reflection coefficient ratio for bs1 general for now . in the output modes",
    "are photodetectors @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the input fields in modes @xmath12 and @xmath11 are respectively in a vacuum state @xmath17 and a coherent state @xmath18 .",
    "the optimum value of the amplitude of the coherent state will be discussed later .",
    "the field to be measured , in state @xmath19 , is in the input mode @xmath13 of bs1 . in the entry port of bs2",
    "is a phase shifter ps capable of altering the phase of the coherent state , thereby changing the argument of the coherent state amplitude .",
    "we let the amplitude of the coherent state be @xmath20 at the entry of bs2 , that is the argument @xmath21 of @xmath22 incorporates the phase shift .",
    "we let @xmath21 be a function of two numbers @xmath23 and @xmath24 , that is @xmath21 = @xmath25 , that will be specified later .    for simplicity , we assume that the distance between the beam splitters is an integer number of wavelengths of the light , which allows us to ignore the evolution of the light , which is just a phase shift , between the beam splitters . if this is difficult experimentally , the discrepancy can be offset by an adjustment of the phase shifter .",
    "the complete time evolution operator is then @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the unitary operators for the action of beam splitters bs2 and bs1 .",
    "let @xmath6 = @xmath29 be the event that photodetectors @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 register @xmath30 and @xmath31 photocounts respectively . the probability for this event is @xmath32 where we have written the combined density operator for the three input fields as @xmath33 and , as the subscripts imply , the trace is over the state spaces for all three modes .",
    "the subscript @xmath34 on the probability in ( [ 3a ] ) is to show explicitly that the probability is a function of the argument @xmath25 of @xmath22 , that is , it is a function of the setting of the phase shifter . using the cyclic property of the trace we can write ( [ 3a ] ) as @xmath35,\\label{5a}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 with @xmath37 from ( [ 5a ] ) we see that @xmath38 is an element of the pom for the measuring device that comprises all of the arrangement depicted in fig .  [ fig1 ] except for the field to be measured .",
    "in general the elements of @xmath38 are not necessarily orthogonal in that @xmath39 is not necessarily zero for @xmath40 .",
    "the origin of the non - orthogonality is the introduction of the two reference modes @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the effect of these two ancillary modes is to cube the dimensionality of the system space . in considering the measuring apparatus to consist of everything in fig .  1 except the state to be measured",
    ", we effectively reduce the apparatus to a single mode measuring device with many more pom elements than the dimensionality of the single mode .",
    "this means that the pom elements can not all be orthogonal to one another .",
    "our aim is to find a linear combination of pom elements equal to the operator @xmath9 .",
    "it is convenient to write this operator as @xmath41 and consider separately the cases where @xmath42 is even and odd .",
    "we examine first the case where @xmath42 is even .",
    "consider the particular detection event @xmath43 = @xmath44 in which the photodetectors @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 detect @xmath48 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 photocounts respectively . as shown in the appendix , this turns out to be the optimum detection event for @xmath42 even . the unitary operator @xmath50 for bs1 is given by @xcite @xmath51,\\label{8a}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the transmission and reflection coefficients of bs1 . @xmath54 for the 50/50 beam splitter bs2 is a similar function of @xmath55 and @xmath56 with @xmath57 .",
    "using these expressions with @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath31 equal to @xmath48 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , we find from the appendix that ( [ 7a ] ) becomes @xmath60|n\\rangle_c\\label{9a}\\ ] ] where @xmath61![(n - n)/2]!\\sqrt{n ! } } \\label{10a}\\ ] ] if @xmath62 is even and @xmath63 = @xmath64 if @xmath62 is odd .",
    "the pom element ( [ 6a ] ) for the detection event @xmath43 then becomes @xmath65}|n\\rangle_{c\\,c } \\langle m| .",
    "\\label{11a}\\ ] ] the terms with @xmath66 odd are all zero .    for @xmath42 = @xmath64 we find from ( [ 11a ] ) that the pom element in ( [ 6a ] ) is just proportional to @xmath67 , allowing us to find the diagonal elements @xmath68 of the density matrix from the probability of detecting the event @xmath69 .    for @xmath42",
    "even and non - zero , we let @xmath25 take particular values @xmath70 and consider a modified measurement procedure in which @xmath23 is held constant but the value of @xmath24 is cycled so that it takes all the integer values from @xmath64 to @xmath71 with equal probability .",
    "this measurement procedure will have its own probability operator measure comprised of elements @xmath72 .",
    "this will be different from our previous pom with elements @xmath73 because it describes a different measurement process .",
    "the pom element for detecting the event @xmath43 by means of this cycling procedure will be given by @xmath74}\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\mbox{}\\times\\sum^{\\lambda/2 - 1}_{j=0}\\exp{[i(n - m)2{\\pi}j/\\lambda]}|n\\rangle_{c\\,c } \\langle m|\\}.\\label{14a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the associated probability can be obtained in practice from the occurrence frequency of the event @xmath43 as we cycle through the values of @xmath24 with the experiment being repeated an equal number of times for each value of @xmath24 .",
    "because we need only consider terms in ( [ 14a ] ) for which @xmath66 is even , we can take the factor involving the summation over @xmath24 as zero unless @xmath66 is zero or @xmath75 , in which case it equals @xmath48 .",
    "this gives us latexmath:[\\ ] ] is used in the text .",
    "the explicit form of @xmath153 is not actually needed .",
    "what is important is an expression for @xmath154 .",
    "this can be derived from ( [ a10b ] ) by evaluating @xmath155 and @xmath156 separately to give @xmath157 where @xmath158 for a mixed reference state with density operator @xmath159 at the entry of bs2 , @xmath160 in ( [ a10d ] ) is replaced by @xmath161 .",
    "it is not difficult to see that the modulus of ( [ a10d ] ) is maximized when @xmath162 if @xmath42 is even and when @xmath163 if @xmath42 is odd .",
    "thus the quotients in ( [ 17a ] ) and ( [ 21a ] ) will have optimum numerators and denominators for the values of @xmath164 and @xmath165 we have used in this paper .",
