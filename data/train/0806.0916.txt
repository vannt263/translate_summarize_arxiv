    "the problem of matter accretion onto the compact objects in the newtonian gravity was formulated in a self - similar manner by bondi @xcite . in the framework of general relativity a steady - state accretion of test gas onto a schwarzschild black hole",
    "was investigated by michel @xcite .",
    "the detailed studies of spherically symmetric accretion of different types of fluids onto black holes were further undertaken in a number of works , see e.  g. @xcite . in @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite for further discussion ) it was shown that accretion of a _ phantom _ fluid onto the schwarzschild black hole results in a diminishing of black hole mass due to a negative flux of energy through the event horizon .",
    "usually in the general relativity it is assumed that matter has a _ suitable _ form . by _ suitable _ , one can imply that the stress - energy tensor of matter satisfy particular energy conditions , i.e. the weak energy condition ( see for details , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "meanwhile the phantom energy violates by definition the weak energy condition @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is an energy density and @xmath2 is a pressure .",
    "it is believed that phantoms generically contain ghosts @xcite and thus should be denied as nonphysical .",
    "it turns out , however , that it is possible to construct a physically reasonable model of phantom , which is stable in the ultraviolet limit , thus giving no catastrophic instabilities of vacuum @xcite .",
    "thus the study of phantoms seems to be not fully meaningless from the physical point of view .",
    "violation of weak energy condition by phantom brings unusual consequences : in the cosmological context the big rip singularity can be formed @xcite ; while the accreting of phantom leads to the diminishing of a black hole mass @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we find a solution for the steady - state accretion of a test perfect fluid with an arbitrary equation of state , @xmath3 , onto the charged black hole , when the event horizon for the reissner - nordstrm metric exists , @xmath4 .",
    "a similar analysis was performed in @xcite .",
    "we show that a phantom energy accretion leads to the decreasing of a black hole mass .",
    "this result is consistent with @xcite for schwarzschild case . on the other hand , we show that when the reissner - nordstrm metric describes a naked singularity with @xmath5 , a perfect fluid does not accrete at all onto the the naked singularity , instead , a static atmosphere is formed .",
    "as we show below , when neglecting the gravitational back reaction of the accreting fluid on the background metric , the extreme state of electrically charged black hole is reached by phantom energy accretion during the finite time .",
    "it is natural to ask then , whether it is possible to convert a reissner - nordstrm black hole into a naked singularity by accretion of phantom fluid .",
    "when phantom accretes onto a schwarzschild black hole , the latter becomes smaller and smaller with time and might completely disappear , i.e. in the big rip scenario .",
    "however , in the case of phantom energy accretion onto a charged black hole , when the mass becomes smaller than the charge , @xmath5 , we might naively think that black hole transforms to a naked singularity by phantom energy accretion .",
    "this would also imply that the third law of black hole thermodynamics breaks down as well @xcite .",
    "such a process of a kerr - newman black hole transformation into a naked singularity by accretion of phantom energy was first discussed in @xcite .",
    "the key conjecture of general relativity is the cosmic censorship by r. penrose @xcite prohibiting the appearance of naked singularity in the gravitational collapse of suitable matter . at the same time",
    ", the inevitable formation of singularity inside a black hole horizon is guaranteed by singularity theorems @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that by `` usual means '' it seems to be impossible to make a naked singularity from a black hole .",
    "for example , the kerr - newman black hole can not be transformed into a naked singularity by capturing test particles with an electrical charge or orbital angular momentum @xcite and can be only approached to the extreme state in a limiting process .",
    "we argue , however , that a test fluid approximation is inevitably violated when the reissner - nordstrm black hole or naked singularity is near to the extreme state .",
    "if this true , the back reaction of the accreting fluid on the background geometry may prevent black transformation into the naked singularity .",

    "however , as we will see below , the existence of this point does not mean that the steady - state accretion actually takes place .",
    "in fact , there is no steady - state accretion onto naked singularity .    for accretion of a `` superluminal '' fluid @xcite , with @xmath48 , the critical point is inside the black hole horizon .",

    "we expect that black hole can not be converted into the naked singularity even by the accretion of phantom energy , and thus the third law of thermodynamics is not violated in this case .",
    "we would like to stress , that although the test fluid approximation seems to break down for the near - extreme state of the black hole / naked singularity , for the far - from - the - extreme state black hole ( in particular , for the schwarzschild solution ) , the parameters of the perfect fluid and the boundary condition at the infinity can be tuned so , that the test fluid approximation describes well the problem under consideration . in particular ,",
    "we stress , that the phantom energy accretion indeed leads to decreasing of the black hole mass .",
    "recently gao _ et al _ @xcite contested the validity of this result , claiming that the inclusion of the back reaction would result in the opposite process , namely , the mass of a black hole increases in the process of phantom accretion . the particular solution was presented in @xcite to support this point .",
    "however , the conclusion of @xcite is doubtful .",
    "first of all , it is only valid for _ imperfect _ fluids , thus making impossible the application of their arguments to the _ perfect _ fluids , for which the effect of black hole mass decreasing was found .",
    "the perfect fluid does not accrete in the solution of gao _ et al _ , and the heat flux is introduced by hand to support this kind of configuration .",
    "note that the heat flux ingredient is crucial to cook up this solution . without the heat flux",
    "the system must evolve to the more physical configuration , which is likely to be the stationary accretion @xcite .",
    "even when the heat flux is introduced , it is unclear whether such an artificial configuration is stable with respect to the small perturbations . finally , it is worthwhile to note that the temperature of the fluid diverges at the black hole event horizon for the solution by gao _",
    "et al_.    if the back reaction does not prevent the process of phantom accretion onto a charged black hole or rotating black hole , then it is a way to violate the cosmic censorship .",
    "otherwise , the phantom energy must be totally forbidden on the more fundamental basis , as for instance , a quantum instability .",

    "<S> , a black hole reaches the extreme state during a finite time with a threat of black hole transformation into the naked singularity and violation of the cosmic censorship conjecture . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate this by using new analytical solutions for spherically symmetric stationary distribution of a test perfect fluid with an arbitrary equation of state in the reissner - nordstrm metric . </S>",
    "<S> our speculative assumption , however , is that the cosmic cosmic censorship conjecture remains valid even for phantom energy case if one takes into account the back reaction of an accreting fluid onto a near extreme black hole . </S>",
    "<S> some hint for the validity of this hypothesis comes from the specific case of the ultra - hard fluid accretion onto the rotating black hole . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the energy density of an accreting fluid diverges at the event horizon of an extreme black hole , thus violating the test fluid approximation . </S>"
