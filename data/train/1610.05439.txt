    "the abundances of carbon and oxygen in the galaxy are currently attracting hot interest of astrophysicists , because they play significant roles in the chemical characteristics of celestial objects such as stars and planets .",
    "for example , carbon - dominated rocky planets ( rather than oxygen - dominated ones such as those existing in the solar system ) are expected to form if c / o ratio of the circumstellar gas is sufficiently high to satisfy @xmath10(c)/@xmath10(o)@xmath11 ( e.g. , bond et al .",
    "2010 ) , which corresponds to [ c / o ] @xmath12 + 0.16 if asplund et al.s ( 2009 ) solar abundances of @xmath13(c ) = 8.43 and @xmath13(o ) = 8.69 are adopted.(x)@xmath14 + 12 $ ] , where @xmath10(x ) and @xmath10(h ) is the number density of element x and h ( hydrogen ) , respectively .",
    "similarly , we use the usual notation for the differential logarithmic abundance ratio relative to the sun : [ x / y]@xmath15 [ x / h ] @xmath16 [ y / h ] @xmath17 @xmath18 -   [ a_{*}({\\rm y } ) -   a_{\\odot}({\\rm y})]$ ] , where the subscripts `` * '' and `` @xmath19 '' mean `` object '' and `` sun '' , respectively . ]",
    "accordingly , the primary issue is whether such stars with appreciably supersolar [ c / o ] ratio ( [ c / o ] @xmath20 ) exist or not , which can be checked by examining spectroscopically determined c and o abundances of solar - type stars . generally speaking",
    ", rather metal - rich stars would be promising for such candidates , because [ c / o ] values observed in f  g stars in the galactic disk tend to rise over zero at [ fe / h ]  @xmath21 as a result of slower decreasing rate of [ c / fe ] than [ o / fe ] with an increase of [ fe / h ] ( see , e.g. , fig .  7 of gustafsson et al .",
    "1999 , or fig .  6d in takeda & honda 2005 ) .",
    "however , despite that several groups challenged this problem recently , considerably discordant results have been reported : delgado mena et al .",

    "( 2014 ) criticized the consequences of these two studies as being questionable ( presumably due to the difficult nature of adopted forbidden [ o  i ] 6300 line which suffers a blending with ni  i line and has a different parameter - sensitivity in comparison to the high - excitation c  i lines also used by them ) , and concluded based on high - excitation c  i 5052/5380 and o  i 77715 lines that very few f  g stars in the solar neighborhood exceed the critical @xmath10(c)/@xmath10(o ) limit of 0.8 even at the highest metallicity of [ fe / h ] = + 0.4 .",
    "furthermore , nakajima and sorahana ( 2016 ) very recently examined the distribution of c - to - o abundance ratio of m dwarfs , and lent support rather to the latter conclusion of nissen et al .",

    ", more observational studies would be needed to settle this controversy .    in this connection , investigating the c and o abundances of stars belonging to an open cluster is of significance , since ( 1 ) they represent the original composition of the gas at a well - established time point in the galactic history and ( 2 ) fairly accurate abundances are determinable by comparing / averaging the results of many members by making use of the chemical homogeneity .",

    "does any different tendency holds for the [ c / o ] ratios of rather young cluster stars ?    in view of this consideration , it is meaningful to check the c and o abundances of another well - known open cluster m  45 ( pleiades ) , which has an age of @xmath9  120130  myr ( cf . ,",
    "basri , marcy , & graham 1996 ; bonatto , bica , & girardi 2004 ) and thus further younger than hyades .",

    "these previous studies suggest that c and o abundances of pleiades are not so much different from the solar composition and thus precise determination of the c / o ratio in this young cluster needs a careful analysis . motivated by this situation",
    ", we decided to contend with this problem by conducting new determinations of c and o abundances for selected 32 pleiades f  g type stars , with an aim of clarifying the characteristics regarding [ c / h ] , [ o / h ] , and [ c / o ] of this young cluster .",

    "( 2009 ) regarding the observational details of these data .",
    "in addition , we newly carried out spectroscopic observations of 7 stars in the 20152016 season by using gaoes ( gunma astronomical observatory echelle spectrograph ) installed at the nasmyth focus of the 1.5  m reflector of gao , by which @xmath35 spectra ( corresponding to the slit width of 2@xmath36 ) covering the wavelength range of 53406580  @xmath37 were obtained .",
    "the data reduction for all these 32 stars ( bias subtraction , flat - fielding , aperture - determination , scattered - light subtraction , spectrum extraction , wavelength calibration , and continuum - normalization ) was performed using the `` echelle '' package of iraf . generally , a number of spectral frames ( sometimes those obtained over several different nights ) for each star were co - added in order to improve the data quality .",

    "besides , since we selected procyon ( f5  iii ",
    "iv ) and sun ( moon ) as the reference stars , their spectra were taken from takeda et al.s ( 2005a ) spectrum database of 160 fgk stars which were obtained at oao . , we had to discard this spectrum portion in the fitting process , by which mn abundance could not be determined for the sun ( cf .",

    "the model atmosphere for each star was constructed by two - dimensionally interpolating kurucz s ( 1993 ) atlas9 model grid ( models with convective overshooting ) with respect to @xmath3 and @xmath39 determined in section  3 , where we exclusively applied the solar - metallicity models .",
    "our abundance determination procedure is basically the same as adopted in paper  i ( see section  5 therein ) , which consists of three consecutive steps : ( i ) synthetic spectrum fitting to derive provisional abundances for the important elements in the relevant spectrum range , ( ii ) inverse calculation of the equivalent width for the line ( or the blended feature ) of c or o in question by using the fitting - based abundance solutions , and ( iii ) analysis of such established equivalent widths to derive the final abundances or abundance errors due to uncertainties in atmospheric parameters .",
    "for the purpose of determining c and o abundances , we decided to employ c  i 5380.325 line ( instead of c  i 7111 - 9 lines adopted in paper  i , which are unavailable in our data ) and o  i 61568 lines ( which were also used in paper  i ) , since these two line features are available in all the spectra at our hand ( cf",
    ". table  1 ) .",
    "accordingly , we selected two wavelength regions : ( a ) 53755390  @xmath37 region ( comprising lines of c , ti , mn , and fe ) , and ( b ) 61506167  @xmath37 region ( comprising lines of o , na , si , ca , fe , and ni ) . the atomic data of the spectral lines were taken from vald database ( ryabchikova et al . 2015 ) for former 53755390  @xmath37 region , while from kurucz and bell s ( 1995 ) compilation for the latter 61506167  @xmath37 region ( in order to maintain consistency with paper  i where the same o  i 61568 lines were used ) .",
    "although all the atomic lines contained in each database were included for each wavelength region , only the selected data for especially important lines are summarized in table  3 .    as to the macroscopic broadening function ( to be convolved with the intrinsic spectrum to simulate the synthetic stellar spectrum )",
    ", we adopted the rotational broadening function ( see , e.g. , gray 2005 ) with the limb - darkening coefficient of @xmath54 , which means that @xmath4 ( projected rotational velocity ) is the control parameter for adjusting the line width in the fitting .",
    "note here that , since neither instrumental broadening nor macroturbulence is explicitly included in our modeling , the resulting @xmath4 solution should not always be regarded as equivalent to true ( projected ) rotational velocity : that is , in case of sharp lines ( e.g. , @xmath55  km  s@xmath2 ) , our @xmath4 solution may lead to some overestimation ( though such a case is rather exceptional because rotational broadening is dominant for most of our sample stars ) . accordingly , the parameters to be varied to accomplish the best fit between the theoretical and observed spectrum by using takeda s ( 1995 ) numerical technique are ( i ) the abundances of relevant elements , ( ii ) @xmath4 , and ( iii ) @xmath56 ( radial velocity shift ) .",
    "the convergence of the fitting solutions turned out fairly successful for most of the cases .",
    "how the theoretical spectrum for the converged solutions fits well with the observed spectrum for each of the 32 pleiades stars ( as well as procyon and sun / moon ) is displayed in figure  3 ( 53755390  @xmath37 fitting , where c , ti , mn , and fe abundances were varied ) and figure  4 ( 61506167  @xmath37 fitting , where o , na , si , ca , fe , and ni abundances were varied ) . the finally resulting values of elemental abundances ( @xmath57 ) as well as @xmath4 derived from the fitting procedure for each region are presented in tablee.txt ( on - line material ) .      next , as done in paper  i , we computed the equivalent widths for the c  i 5380.325 line ( @xmath58)(5380.227 ) turned out only @xmath9  20% compared with @xmath59(5380.325 ) , as demonstrated in figure  5a , it can not make any important contribution .",
    "so , we considered only the c  i 5380.325 line in evaluating the non - lte correction ( @xmath60 ) . ] and the o  i 6158 feature ( @xmath61 ; comprising three components ) based on these fitting - based abundances .",
    "then , the non - lte abundances [ @xmath62(c ) and @xmath62(o ) ] and the relevant non - lte corrections ( @xmath60 and @xmath63 ; where @xmath64 ) were derived based on these @xmath58 and @xmath61 , where the non - lte effect for the c and o lines was taken into account as done by takeda and honda ( 2005 ) . the resulting equivalent widths and non - lte abundances as well as corrections for the sample stars",
    "are also given in tablee.txt ( on - line material ) .",
    "the uncertainties in @xmath57(c ) and @xmath57(o ) due to errors in the adopted atmospheric parameters were estimated by repeating the analysis on the @xmath59 values while perturbing the standard parameters interchangeably by @xmath65  k in @xmath3 , @xmath66  dex in @xmath39 , and @xmath67  km  s@xmath2 in @xmath40 ( which are considered to be typical magnitudes of ambiguities ; cf . the last paragraph in section  3 ) .",
    "we also evaluated errors due to random noises of the observed spectra by estimating s / n - related uncertainties in the equivalent width ( @xmath68 ) by invoking the relation derived by cayrel ( 1988 ) , @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the pixel size ( @xmath71  @xmath37 ) , @xmath72 is the width of a line ( which we assumed to be @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the velocity of light ) , and @xmath75 .",
    "this approach is known to yield abundance errors of almost the same order of magnitude as those derived by extensive numerical simulations based on a large number of mock spectra with artificial noises ( cf . takeda & honda 2015 ) .",
    "we thus determined the abundances for each of the perturbed @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively , from which the differences from the standard abundance ( @xmath57 ) were derived as @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "figure  5 ( c ) and figure  6 ( o ) graphically show the resulting equivalent widths ( @xmath59 ; with @xmath80 as error bars ) , non - lte corrections ( @xmath81 ) , non - lte abundances ( @xmath62 ; with @xmath82 and @xmath83 as error bars ) , and abundance variations in response to parameter changes ( @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 ) , as functions of @xmath3 .",
    "we can recognize from these figures that ( a ) non - lte corrections are very small ( @xmath30 a few hundredths dex ) and practically negligible , ( b ) abundance errors due to parameter uncertainties ( essentially due to ambiguities in @xmath3 ) amount to @xmath87  dex for c and @xmath30  0.2  dex for o ( i.e. , o abundances are subject to comparatively larger errors than c abundances ) , and ( c ) s / n - related abundance errors are not so significant except for @xmath62(o ) of lower-@xmath3 stars ( 6000  k  @xmath88  k ) where the o  i line becomes appreciably weak ( @xmath89  m@xmath37 or less ) .",
    "since the present abundance study is based on a differential analysis , the results should not be significantly affected by uncertainties in line - formation or model atmospheres such as 3d hydrodynamical effect ( e.g. , amarsi et al .",
    "2016 , who showed that the 3d correction for the o  i 6158.2 line is on the order of @xmath9  0.1  dex and almost @xmath3-independent ) or treatment of convection ( such as with / without overshooting , resulting in abundance differences of @xmath9  0.1  dex ; cf .",
    "paper  i ) which we do not explicitly take into consideration .",
    "in particular , thanks to the fact that c and o abundances are derived from similar high - excitation lines of neutral species , the resulting [ c / o ] ratio ( the main purpose ) must be practically insensitive to such modeling details .",
    "the differential abundances ( [ c / h ] , [ o / h ] , and [ fe / h ] ) to be discussed in section  5 are computed as [ c / h ]  @xmath17 @xmath90(c ) @xmath16 @xmath91(c ) , [ o / h ]  @xmath17 @xmath92(o ) @xmath16 @xmath93(o ) , [ fe / h]@xmath94 @xmath95(fe ) @xmath16 @xmath96(fe ) , and [ fe / h]@xmath97 @xmath98(fe ) @xmath16 @xmath99(fe ) , where the adopted reference solar abundances of c , o , and fe are @xmath91(c ) = 8.43 , @xmath93(o ) = _ 8.81_,(o ) solution of 8.68 derived from the 61506167  @xmath37 region fitting of the moon spectrum in this study but used the value ( 8.81 ) derived in paper  i from the 6156.46158.6  @xmath37 fitting .",
    "this is because the strength of this o  i 6158 line becomes considerably weak ( @xmath100  23  m@xmath37 ) at the solar temperature and the @xmath57(o ) solution resulting from fitting is appreciably sensitive to a slight difference in the vertical offset ( i.e. , constant @xmath101 defined in takeda 1995 ) , which is affected by the difference in the adopted spectral range and in the treatment of 6157.4  @xmath37 feature . in the present case ,",

    "a close inspection revealed that discrepancies are seen only for rapidly rotating stars ( @xmath108  50  km  s@xmath2 ) while a consistency is confirmed for slower rotators of @xmath109  km  s@xmath2 ( cf .",

    "figures  2d ( @xmath4 ) and 2e ( [ fe / h ] ) show the comparison of these with funayama et al.s ( 2009 ) results , where we can see a fairly good agreement for @xmath4 while some ( though not so serious ) discrepancy up to @xmath111  dex is seen for [ fe / h ] .",
    "we now discuss the trends of c and o abundances as well as c / o ratios of the pleiades stars .",
    "the finally resulting values of [ fe / h ] , [ c / h ] , [ o / h ] , and [ c / o ] for the 32 program stars are plotted against @xmath3 in figure  8 , where combined uncertainties due to parameter ambiguities and data noises ( cf .",
    "subsection 4.2 ) are shown by error bars .",
    "the following characteristics are read from these figures : +  no systematic dependence upon @xmath3 is observed in these results and thus almost homogeneous .",

    "+  this can be quantitatively confirmed .",
    "since abundances from rapid rotators tend to be less reliable ( as seen for the case of [ fe / h]@xmath104 in subsection  5.1 ) , we confine ourselves only to sharp - line stars of @xmath114  km  s@xmath2 ( filled symbols in figure  8) .",
    "then , we have @xmath25[fe / h]@xmath26 = @xmath115 ( @xmath116 ) , @xmath25[c / h]@xmath26 = @xmath117 ( @xmath118 ) , @xmath25[o / h]@xmath26 = @xmath119 ( @xmath120 ) , and @xmath25[c / o]@xmath26 = @xmath121 ( @xmath122 ) , which further result in the fe - scaled abundance ratios of @xmath25[c / fe]@xmath26 = @xmath117 ( @xmath123 ) and @xmath25[o / fe]@xmath26 = @xmath119 ( @xmath124 ) .",

    "we thus found that [ c / o ] in the pleiades cluster is apparently subsolar by @xmath8  dex as a result of subsolar c and supersolar o. this means that the trend of negative [ c / o ] suspected in hyades stars ( [ c / o ] @xmath6  dex ; cf .",
    "sect .  6.2 in paper  i )",
    "is more accentuated in pleiades stars , which makes contrast with the case of field solar - type stars of near - solar metallicity ( [ fe / h ]  @xmath5 ) where [ c / o ]  @xmath5 holds on the average ( cf .",
    "fig .  6 in takeda & honda 2005 ) . in order to clarify this fact",
    ", we recalculated the average values of @xmath25[fe / h]@xmath26 , @xmath25[c / fe]@xmath26 , @xmath25[o / fe]@xmath26 , and @xmath25[c / o]@xmath26 for hyades stars ( here , only those with @xmath125  k were used to make the sample as similar as possible )  k are : @xmath25[fe / h]@xmath26 = @xmath126 ( @xmath123 ) , @xmath25[c / h]@xmath26 = @xmath127 ( @xmath128 ) , @xmath25[o / h]@xmath26 = @xmath129 ( @xmath130 ) , and @xmath25[c / o]@xmath26 = @xmath131 ( @xmath132 ) .",
    "accordingly , [ x / fe ] ratios for hyades are @xmath25[c / fe]@xmath26 = @xmath126 ( @xmath128 ) and @xmath25[o / fe]@xmath26 = @xmath133 ( @xmath134 ) . ] as we have done for the pleiades stars in subsection  5.2 .",
    "these mean abundances obtained for both hyades and pleiades are plotted by large symbols in figure  9 , where the corresponding values of field stars ( the results were derived by using c  i 5380 and o",
    "i 6158 lines while restricting to only f  g stars of @xmath125  k ) are also shown .",
    "we can confirm by inspecting figure  9c that the @xmath25[c / o]@xmath26 values for hyades and pleiades stars locate at the lower envelope of the [ c / o ] vs. [ fe / h ] distribution of field stars , which suggests that the c / o ratios of these two open clusters rather deviate from the mean trend exhibited by the latter .",
    "why do the c / o ratios of cluster stars ( [ c / o ]  @xmath8 to @xmath135 ) are so different from those of f ",
    "g stars ( of near - solar metallicity ) and the sun ( [ c / o ]  @xmath5 ) ?",
    "does it have anything to do with the clear distinction in stellar ages between the former ( @xmath9  120130  myr for pleiades and @xmath9  625  myr for hyades ; cf .",
    "section  1 ) and the latter ( @xmath9  110  gyr ; cf .",
    "14 of takeda 2007 ) ?    here",
    ", it is important to note that the result we derived for pleiades f  g stars is quite similar to that recently reported for b - type stars .",
    "that is , nieva and przybilla ( 2012 ) determined the light - element abundances for 20 b - type stars ( 16000  k  @xmath136  k , @xmath137 ) and concluded that the mean c and o abundances relative to asplund et al.s ( 2009 ) solar abundances are @xmath25[c / h]@xmath138 and @xmath25[o / h]@xmath139 ( see table  9 or fig .",
    "12 of their paper ) ; i.e. , subsolar [ c / h ] as well as supersolar [ o / h ] by @xmath87  dex , resulting in [ c / o ]  @xmath8  dex , which is just as we have obtained for the pleiades stars . considering that these b - type stars around @xmath140 have typical ages of several tens myr ( e.g. , georgy et al . 2013 ) , this result of subsolar [ c / o ] appears to be the common characteristics seen for young stars born within @xmath141  yr .",
    "therefore , the same discussion as developed by nieva and przybilla ( 2012 ) regarding the sun and b - type stars may hold for the present case .",
    "their important suggestion was that the sun was born in comparatively inner / metal - rich region at the galactocentric radius of @xmath142  56  kpc and has migrated outward to the current position of @xmath142  8  kpc , which naturally explains the paradox why the light - element abundances of such young stars are nearly the same ( or even slightly underabundant ) compared to the sun ( age of @xmath143  yr ) despite that chemical evolution must have enriched the galactic gas during the passage of time . as they pointed out",
    ", this hypothesis leads to a reasonable account for the larger c - to - o abundance ratio of the sun compared to those of young stars in the solar neighborhood , because c / o in the galactic disk tends to decline with an increase of @xmath144 as indicated from recombination - line observations of h  ii regions ( esteban et al .",
    "2005 ) and supported by some theoretical models of chemical evolution ( carigi et al . 2005 ) .",
    "consequently , according to this scenario , our observational fact that the [ c / o ] values in the pleiades f  g stars are by @xmath8  dex lower than the sun may be interpreted as due to the difference of c / o ratios in two kinds of interstellar gases : ( 1 ) which recently formed young stars near to the current sun ( @xmath142  8  kpc , age of @xmath141  yr ) and ( 2 ) which formed the sun in the inner region ( @xmath142  56  kpc ) long before ( @xmath143  yr ago ) .",
    "we should remark , however , that the [ c / o ] values of field stars of near - solar metallicity ( [ fe / h ]  @xmath5 ) studied by takeda and honda ( 2005 ) evenly distribute around @xmath5 ( figure  9c ) , which means that the sun is not exceptional compared to nearby solar - type stars in terms of the c / o ratio .",
    "so , if our sun really has significatly changed its orbit since its birth , such a migration may not necessarily be a rare phenomenon for stars in the galactic disk .    in summary , while we found based on our c and o abundance study of 32 pleiades stars that the [ c / o ] ratios of these recently formed young stars are by @xmath8  dex lower than those of the sun and similarly aged solar - metalicity field stars , this difference between these two age groups is presumably due to ( not the direct time - evolution effect but ) the orbit migration mechanism which galactic stars may undergo in a long time . given this scenario , detecting c - rich stars with @xmath10(c)/@xmath10(o)@xmath11 ( mentioned in section  1 ) would be hardly possible among young stars in the solar neighborhood , while such a possibility may be higher for old metal - rich stars which were born near to the galactic bulge .",
    "special thanks are due to h. funayama for his substantial contribution in obtaining the observational data for 25 pleiades stars in the 20062007 season , upon which this study heavily depends .",
    "this research has made use of the simbad database ( operated by cds , strasbourg , france ) as well as the vald database ( operated at uppsala university , the institute of astronomy ras in moscow , and the university of vienna ) .",
    "data reduction was in part carried out by using the common - use data analysis computer system at the astronomy data center ( adc ) of the national astronomical observatory of japan .",
    "in deriving differential [ o / h ] ( subsection  4.3 ) , we intentionally adopted @xmath13(o ) = 8.81 derived by takeda and honda ( 2005 ) as the reference solar oxygen abundance , instead of the slightly lower value of 8.68 obtained in this study , since we believe that the former is more reliable than the latter .",
    "this is related to the difficulty involved with o - abundance determination from o  i 61568 lines in the spectrum of the sun , where lines of other species are blended because of its comparatively low @xmath3 .",
    "actually , there are differences between these two analyses , although they used the same model atmosphere and the same moon spectrum .",
    "+  first , takeda and honda ( 2005 ) carried out the fitting in the limited 6156.46158.6  @xmath37 region ( only 2.2  @xmath37 wide ) while we applied fittings to a much wider 61506167  @xmath37 region in this study since stars with considerably broad lines ( up to @xmath145  km  s@xmath2 ) are involved ( i.e. , to ensure the stability of solutions ) .",
    "+  second , although both studies were based on the same kurucz and bell s ( 1995 ) compilation for the atomic line data , takeda and honda ( 2005 ) applied arbitrary chages in the @xmath146 values of 4 ti lines ( cf .",
    "footnote  5 therein ) in order to reproduce the absorption feature at @xmath147  @xmath37 , while such modifications were not applied in this study where all the data given in kurucz and bell ( 1995 ) were employed without any change since such a @xmath147  @xmath37 feature is seen only for lower-@xmath3 stars",
    "( @xmath148  k ; cf . fig .  1 in takeda & honda 2005 ) and irrelevant for most of our sample stars .    the resulting @xmath13(o )",
    "solutions for these two cases show a difference by 0.13  dex ( 8.81 and 8.68 ) because of the different wavelength span and different treatment for the @xmath147  @xmath37 feature ( figure  10a ) . however , we have a good reason to believe that the former solution ( 8.81 ) is more reliable than the latter ( 8.68 ) , as manifested from the simulated strength of the strongest 6158.2  @xmath37 line ( which is considered to be practically blend - free and most reliable among the three o  i features , in contrast to those at 6156.0 and 6156.8  @xmath37 being appreciably contaminated by lines of other species ) in comparison with kurucz et al.s ( 1984 ) solar flux spectrum of very high resolving power ( figure  10b ) .",

    "further , takeda and honda ( 2005 ) derived [ o / h]@xmath156 ( from [ o  i ]  6300 ) , @xmath126 ( from o  i  61578 ; finally adopted by them ) , and + 0.07 ( from o  i 77715 ) .",

    "is severely blended with the ca  i  6156.023 line which we took into consideration ( cf .",
    "table  3 ) .",
    "meanwhile , the o  i  6156.8 line ( medium strength ) is evidently blended with some other line ( cf .",
    "figure  10b ) which is not included in kurucz and bell s ( 1995 ) compilation .",
    "this unknown blend may be due to fe  i , since the vald database contains fe  i 6156.804 ( @xmath157 = 4.956  ev , @xmath158 ) , though this @xmath159 must be erroneously too large as it predicts too strong contribution [ @xmath160  m@xmath37 for @xmath13(fe ) = 7.50 ] compared to the required amount of only @xmath161  m@xmath37 . finally , although pereira , asplund , and kiselman ( 2009 ) suspected that the strongest o  i 6158.2 line is blended by weak cn lines , this effect ( if any exists ) would not be so significant , because bertran de lis et al .",

    "we originally wished to organize this study on pleiades stars in close analogy with paper  i , where not only c and o abundances but also li abundances of hyades f  g stars were determined .",
    "unfortunately , given that we primarily relied on the available archived data for many of our sample stars ( 25 out of 32 ) , li abundances for those stars could not be derived as the li  i 6708 line was outside the wavelength range of their spectra ( cf .",

    "2632 in table  1 ) newly observed by ourselves in the 20152016 season , we could determine their li abundances , which we briefly report here for reference .",
    "the procedure for li abundance determination is essentially the same as described in takeda and kawanomoto ( 2005 ) ( also adopted in paper  i ) , which may be consulted for more details .",
    "the best - fit theoretical spectrum with the observed data in the 67026712  @xmath37 region is shown in figure  10 for each star .",
    "the resulting equivalent width of the li  i 6708 doublet ( in m@xmath37 ) , non - lte abundance ( in the usual normalization of @xmath57(h)=12 ) , and non - lte correction ( in dex ) are ( @xmath59 , @xmath62(li ) , @xmath81 ) = ( 81.3 , 3.07 , 0.00 ) , ( 168.2 , 3.50 , + 0.07 ) , ( 137.7 , 3.10 , + 0.10 ) , ( 142.5 , 3.34 , + 0.05 ) , ( 55.6 , 3.00 , @xmath163 ) , ( 144.4 , 3.30 , + 0.06 ) , and ( 123.6 , 3.24 , + 0.04 ) , for hd  23269 ( no .  26 ) , hd  23386 ( no .  27 ) , msk  65 ( no .  28 ) , bd  + 22  548 ( no .  29 ) , hd  23513 ( no .",

    "<S> in order to investigate the carbon - to - oxygen ratio of the young open cluster m  45 ( pleiades ) , the c and o abundances of selected 32 f  g type dwarfs ( in the effective temperature range of @xmath0  58007600  k and projected rotational velocity range of @xmath1  10110  km  s@xmath2 ) belonging to this cluster were determined by applying the synthetic spectrum - fitting technique to c  i 5380 and o  i 61568 lines . </S>",
    "<S> the non - lte corrections for these c  i and o  i lines were found to be practically negligible ( less than a few hundredths dex ) . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting c and o abundances ( along with the fe abundance ) turned out nearly uniform without any systematic dependence upon @xmath3 or @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we found , however , in spite of almost solar fe abundance ( [ fe / h ]  @xmath5 ) , carbon turned out to be slightly subsolar ( [ c / h ]  @xmath6 ) while oxygen slightly supersolar ( [ o / h ]  @xmath7 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this lead to a conclusion that [ c / o ] ratio was moderately subsolar ( @xmath8 ) in the primordial gas from which these pleiades stars were formed @xmath9  </S>",

    "<S> interestingly , similarly young b - type stars are reported to show just the same result ( [ c / o ]  @xmath8 ) , while rather aged ( @xmath9  110  gyr ) field f  g stars of near - solar metallicity yield almost the solar value ( [ c / o ]  @xmath5 ) on the average . </S>",
    "<S> such a difference in the c / o ratio between two star groups of distinctly different ages may be explained as a consequence of orbit migration mechanism which galactic stars may undergo over a long time . </S>"
