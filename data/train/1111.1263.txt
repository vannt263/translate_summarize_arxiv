    "physically consistent string / m - theory derived models number at least approximately @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the large number of vacua has prompted both computational and analytical examinations of the the  landscape \" of possible string vacua , e.g.   @xcite .",
    "the weakly coupled free fermionic heterotic string ( wcffhs)@xcite approach to string model construction has produced some of the most phenomenologically realistic string models to date @xcite . outlined in this section are the basic steps needed to construct models within this formalism . also detailed are the methodology of systematic searches and the difficulties they pose , and an explanation of the nahe set of basis vectors used to construct realistic string models .",
    "finally , results of the preliminary order-2 and order-3 extension to the nahe set are presented , with an emphasis on gut group models .",
    "the heterotic theories consist of closed strings which have independent sets of left and right moving modes .",
    "the left moving modes are ten dimensional superstrings , while the right moving modes are 26 dimensional bosonic strings .",
    "wcffhs models are constructed by specifying the phases that fermion modes gain when parallel transported around non - contractible loops on a genus-1 world sheet of a string .",
    "the number of possible values these phases may take is referred to as the order , while the number of  basis vectors \" of phases used to specify the model is referred to as the layer .",
    "the linear combinations of the basis vectors produce sectors from which the physical states of the model are built .",
    "the force and matter content is then determined from the symmetries of these states .",
    "modular invariance highly constrains the possible components of the basis vectors .",
    "a consistent set of basis vectors @xmath2 is such that : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the least common multiple of the orders of the basis vectors @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and the dot product is lorentz , with a relative minus sign between the left - moving and the right - moving contributions .",
    "additionally ,    _ the number of simultaneous periodic modes for any three basis vectors must be even . _    taking all possible linear combinations of the basis vectors builds the full  geometry \" of the model , designated by sectors @xmath7 .",
    "states from a sector @xmath8 are designated by their charge vectors @xmath9 , defined by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is all combinations of 0,@xmath121 .",
    "the massless ( with regard to the planck scale ) states are such that @xmath13 in a real fermion basis . in a complex basis , the values are halved . a physical state in a model a state must survive all gso projections ( gsops ) from basis vectors @xmath14 .",
    "these require that @xmath15 where @xmath16 are the coefficients on the basis vectors used to construct @xmath8 , @xmath17 is 0 ( 1 ) for bosonic ( fermionic ) basis vectors @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is an element of the gso coefficient matrix .",
    "the gso matrix must also follow its own modular invariance constraints , given by @xmath20      systematic searches are designed to do a ",
    "complete \" scan of the possible consistent sets of basis vectors and gso coefficients that define models within a chosen parameter space . in the discussions herein , models are classified into the order ( the number of available twists for right - moving modes ) and the layer ( the number of basic vectors ) .",
    "searches with random sampling have already been performed @xcite .",
    "however , random sampling methods have several difficulties which are non - trivial to address @xcite .",
    "systematic methods avoid these inherent difficulties because models are not  sampled \" - they form a complete set . described in this section",
    "are the motivations and challenges to systematic searches of wcffhs models including model building speed , model data storage , and model comparison",
    ".      the scope of the systematic wcffhs model searches can be limited by several factors .",
    "the first , and most obvious , factor is that of model building speed . because the number of models to be built can get quite large ,",
    "minimization of construction speed is essential . assuming the model building process takes around 1 second",
    ", a data set with 1,000,000 models would take about 28 hours . as the number of",
    " layers \" of basis vectors in a model increases , the number of total models to build grows geometrically ; each of the 1,000,000 models now has on the order of 1,000,000 new basis vectors ( likely more than that ) with modular invariance .",
    "thus , the total number of models in the data set of the next layer is an estimated @xmath21 . at one model every second ,",
    "the layer-2 data set would be completed in approximately 3000 years .",
    "several steps can be taken to reduce the time required for model construction , both from an analytical and implementation standpoint . from the implementation side , understanding optimization techniques when writing the model building software is essential . minimizing file and screen i / o , as well as the amount of copying done in memory are crucial steps needed to reduce the computing time .",
    "another computational concern is one of data storage . while a  master atlas \" of basis vectors and the models to which they map is desirable , it is not feasible .",
    "the estimated average amount of space per model is 0.725 kb .",
    "for the 1,000,000 model data set , this amounts to 725 mb .",
    "the next layer would use approximately @xmath22 tb , making a pure  atlas \" of wcffhs models unreasonable to pursue .",
    "there are two solutions to this problem .",
    "one is to gather statistics as the models are generated without keeping the models themselves in memory .",
    "while this approach is less taxing on system resources , it does have disadvantages .",
    "in particular , one must know the statistics to be gathered on the models prior to runtime .",
    "any additional statistics would require a second run .",
    "moreover , the total model set would have to be statistically analyzed , as opposed to the distinct models only , as the models are not being kept in memory .",
    "double - counts that result from the construction method itself can not be avoided with this approach .",
    "the other approach is to count the distinct models only , writing those to a file that serves as a small repository .",
    "while a full discussion of uniqueness in wcffhs models is discussed in the next section , it suffices to say there are disadvantages to this approach as well . in particular",
    ", the definition of uniqueness in these models can be somewhat nebulous at times .",
    "additionally , each unique model that is found must be compared with the other unique models that have been constructed , making each model require more computing time to complete .",
    "analytic techniques can also be used to reduce the number of redundant models produced . as these techniques are related to uniqueness in wcffhs phenomenology , discussion of such analysis",
    "will be deferred until after uniqueness has been addressed .",
    "the previously described computational limitations force the analysis to be only on models that are considered distinct .",
    "however , the definition of distinctness amongst wcffhs models is not always clear . in particular the  amount \" of phenomenology done to distinguish the models from one another must be balanced with the amount of computing time required to perform such analyses , as well as how easily the analyses can be automated .",
    "consider two different basis vector sets producing the same gauge and non - abelian matter content . even though the actual charge vectors and gauge group eigenvalues for the two models may be different , the overarching group structures are identical .",
    "this could be due to a string - scale type symmetry within the construction method itself , in which case there would be some transformation that could be applied to one of the basis vector sets to reproduce the other .",
    "the @xmath1 charges of those two models , once diagonalized , would be the same .",
    "such a symmetry in the construction method could in principle be revealed through an analytic study .",
    "however , it could also be the case that these models have non - equivalent @xmath1 structures , and that the gsops eliminated the states that were different between the models .",
    "such models will not have identical superpotentials or d- and f - flat directions , all of which have significant impact on the phenomenological viability of a model .",
    "for the systematic searches in this study the @xmath1 charges of the matter representations will not be considered ( although they will in future studies ) .",
    "thus , two models will be considered identical herein if they have the same gauge and non - abelian matter content and the same number of non - abelian singlets .",
    "this approach has a caveat , however .",
    "as the models become increasingly complex , comparing two models becomes increasingly difficult to automate .",
    "consider the following two  toy \" models whose particle content is presented in tables [ tab : toy_models ] .",
    ".two models illustrating the inherent difficulty in comparing wcffhs models .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : nahe_gut_generations ]    two three - generation models were discussed - a flipped-@xmath23 model and a left - right symmetric model . while they did have the requisite number of chiral matter generations , there were several unfavorable properties in both models that prevented them from being considered quasi - realistic .",
    "they are a proof that three - generation models with geometric interpretations can be built with order-3 basis vector extensions .",
    "the distributions of st susys across the gut group subsets remained largely the same , save the @xmath24 models , which displayed a greater statistical tendency for st susy enhancements .",
    "further examination revealed that all of the exceptional groups , as well as @xmath25 and @xmath26 , display more enhanced st susy models for the nahe + o3l1 data set .",
    "it was also shown that the presence of the @xmath27 did not significantly impact the gauge content . however ,",
    "the matter content of the models without @xmath27 is affected , as the @xmath27 sector produces states other than susy partners .",
