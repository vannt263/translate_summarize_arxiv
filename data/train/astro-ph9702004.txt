    "the thermal - like surface radiation detected recently from a number of isolated neutron stars ( nss ) ( see , e.  g. , gelman 1995 for a review ) provides valuable information about the ns temperatures and radii .",
    "this enables one to trace the thermal history of nss and to put constraints on the properties of the superdense matter in ns interiors ( e.  g. , pethick 1992 ) .",
    "however , the observed spectra are substantially modified by reprocessing of the thermal radiation in ns atmospheres ( romani 1987 ) .",
    "pavlov et al .",
    "( 1995 ; and references therein ) have shown that the strong magnetic fields of nss , @xmath6  g , affect the emergent spectra significantly .",
    "in particular , photoabsorption by the strongly magnetized atomic hydrogen gas which presumably covers the ns surface should be taken into account .",
    "the magnetic field strongly affects the structure and radiative transitions of the hydrogen atom when the electron cyclotron energy @xmath7 is much greater than the rydberg energy @xmath8  ev , i.  e. , @xmath9 .",
    "in particular , the atom becomes stretched along the magnetic field , the ionization potential is increased by a factor of @xmath10 , and radiative transitions become strongly dependent on the photon polarization .",
    "photoionization of strongly magnetized hydrogen atoms _ at rest _ has been considered by a number of authors . the most thorough consideration in the _ adiabatic approximation _",
    ", applicable for very large @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( @xmath13 is the photon frequency ) , was presented by potekhin & pavlov ( 1993 ; hereafter pp93 ) .",
    "this approximation neglects coupling of states with different values of the landau quantum number @xmath14 which specifies the energy of the electron motion transverse to the magnetic field ( the other quantum number associated with the transverse motion , the projection @xmath15 of the angular momentum onto the field , is exact for atoms at rest ) .",
    "potekhin , pavlov , & ventura ( 1996 ; hereafter ppv97 ) went beyond the adiabatic approximation and resolved , in particular , a longstanding contradiction : some authors ( e.  g. , schmitt et al .",
    "1981 ; wunner et al .  1983",
    "; ventura et al .",
    "1992 ) concluded that the photoionization cross section is exactly zero for photons polarized transversely to the magnetic field , whereas other authors ( e.  g. , gnedin , pavlov , & tsygan 1973 ; miller & neuhauser 1991 ; pp93 ) obtained finite cross sections .",
    "pp93 showed that the discrepancy rooted in different forms of the interaction potential ( so - called `` velocity form '' and `` length form '' ) employed by the two groups of authors , and ppv97 proved that the velocity form used by the former group resulted in missing the main contribution to the cross section .",
    "the nonadiabatic approach enabled ppv97 to study correlation of different ionization channels and manifestation of autoionization ( beutler  fano ) resonances in the photoabsorption spectra .",
    "the above - cited papers did not take into account the atomic motion inevitable in any real situation .",
    "if there were no strong magnetic field , the motion would only lead to the trivial doppler broadening of the spectral lines and photoionization edges . on the contrary",
    ", the finiteness of the atomic velocities in strong magnetic fields leads to many qualitatively new effects ( pavlov & mszros  1993 ; hereafter pm93 ) associated with strong distortion of the atomic structure due the lorentz electric field generated by the motion . since the moving atom loses its cylindrical symmetry ,",
    "the projection @xmath15 of the angular momentum is no longer a good quantum number ( in other words , the @xmath15-adiabatic approach which neglects coupling of states with different @xmath15 becomes invalid ) .",
    "hence , the selection rules for the radiative transitions are changed so that new types of transitions become allowed . since the atomic structure depends on the velocity of the atom , and different atomic states",
    "are affected by the motion differently , a new type of broadening of spectral features , _",
    "magnetic broadening _",
    ", becomes the most important .",
    "the energies and wave functions of the moving atom depend on the transverse component @xmath2 of a _",
    "generalized momentum _",
    "@xmath3 ( see below ) , which , contrary to the canonical and kinetic momenta , is conserved for a neutral atom moving in a magnetic field .",
    "pm93 analyzed various effects of the motion of the hydrogen atom in the perturbative regime , when @xmath2 is small .",
    "when @xmath2 exceeds some critical value , the magnetic and ( motion - generated ) electric fields form a potential well at a distance @xmath16 from the proton , which gives rise to so - called _ decentered _ ( or shifted ) states ( burkova et al .  1976 ) .",
    "the decentered states recover the cylindrical symmetry ( @xmath15 becomes a good quantum number again at large @xmath2 ) , but the axis of symmetry , with respect to which @xmath15 is defined , is shifted by @xmath17 . in other words , these states can be described in the _ shifted _",
    "@xmath15-adiabatic approximation .",
    "binding energies , wavefunctions and oscillator strengths of radiative transitions between the discrete levels of an arbitrarily moving h atom ( beyond the adiabatic approximation ) have been studied by potekhin ( 1994 ; hereafter p94 ) .",
    "our recent study of the hydrogen bound - bound opacity in ns atmospheres ( pavlov & potekhin 1995 ; hereafter pp95 ) was based on these results .",
    "less investigated are effects of the motion across the field on the bound - free radiative transitions of atoms .",
    "pm93 have shown , in the perturbation approach , that the motion strongly affects photoionization cross sections through opening and enhancement of additional photoionization channels forbidden for the non - moving atom due to its cylindrical symmetry , and through the strong magnetic broadening of the photoionization edges .",
    "bezchastnov & potekhin ( 1994 ; hereafter bp94 ) suggested a modification of the adiabatic approach which allows for different displacements of the initial and final states and presented a convenient formalism for calculating the transition rates between such states .",
    "they have also performed calculations with the initial state treated non - adiabatically ; the two approaches exhibited a fair agreement with each other .",
    "kopidakis , ventura & herold ( 1996 ; hereafter kvh96 ) also went beyond the perturbation approximation and calculated the frequency dependences of the cross sections for various values of @xmath2 , assuming these values small enough to neglect the decentered bound states .",
    "the results of the two latter papers differ from each other by orders of magnitude for radiation polarized _ transversely _ to the field .",
    "the origin of the discrepancy is the same as for atoms at rest  kvh96 employed the velocity form of the interaction potential which led to wrong results when used with the @xmath14-adiabatic approximation which treats the landau number @xmath14 as the exact quantum number .",
    "both bp94 and kvh96 treated final ( continuum ) states of electron in the ( shifted ) adiabatic approximation , neglecting coupling of final states with different @xmath15 and contribution of quasi - bound ( autoionizing ) states to the photoionization cross section .",
    "the general non - adiabatic numerical approach developed by ppv97 for the continuum wave functions of the strongly magnetized hydrogen has been applied there to the particular case of non - moving atoms . in the present work",
    ", we employ that approach , together with the theoretical formalism of p94 and bp94 , for an accurate treatment of both discrete and continuum states of the moving atom and the radiative transitions between them .",
    "unlike bp94 and kvh96 , we do not restrict ourselves to the case of relatively small generalized momenta of atoms , but consider also the decentered states which arise at large @xmath2 .",
    "this enables us to calculate the cross sections of photoionization by arbitrarily polarized photons of the hydrogen atom arbitrarily moving in a magnetic field @xmath6  g. averaging these cross sections with thermal distributions of atoms yields the bound - free opacities needed for modeling ns atmospheres .",
    "in section 2 we outline basic techniques for numerical treatment of a strongly magnetized h atom and its interactions with radiation ( the general form of the interaction matrix elements is given in the appendix ) . in section 3",
    "we present the photoionization cross sections of h atoms in various states of motion across the magnetic field and cross sections averaged over thermal motion for conditions typical for atmospheres of isolated nss .",
    "the center - of - mass motion of an atom in a magnetic field can be conveniently described by the generalized momentum @xmath3 ( gorkov & dzyaloshinskii 1968 ; see also johnson , hirschfelder , & yang 1983 ) , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the canonical momentum , @xmath20 is the relative coordinate , the subscript `` e '' or `` p '' indicates electron or proton , respectively , and the cylindric gauge of the vector potential , @xmath21 , is used .",
    "we shall consider the representation in which all three components of @xmath3 have definite values .",
    "then the two - body wavefunction can be factorized into a phase factor depending on the center - of - mass coordinate and the wavefunction @xmath22 depending on @xmath20 .",
    "it is useful to define a basic electron - proton separation @xmath23 and to regard the deviation from it , @xmath24 , as an independent variable .",
    "here @xmath25 is the position of the relative guiding center , and @xmath26 is the _ shift parameter_. it is also convenient to use a special axial gauge of the vector potential ( vincke , le dourneuf , & baye 1992 ; p94 ) .",
    "then we arrive at a set of hamiltonians @xmath27 and wavefunctions @xmath28 depending on @xmath26 . in the particular cases of @xmath29 and @xmath30 ,",
    "the `` conventional '' and `` shifted '' representations of gorkov & dzyaloshinskii ( 1968 ) are recovered .",

    "equation ( [ landau ] ) implies that after photoionization of a moving hydrogen atom , when the photoelectron moves away to large distances at which the coulomb interaction can be neglected , it acquires the displacement @xmath46 from the proton in the transverse plane .",
    "a wavefunction @xmath47 of an atomic state @xmath48 can be expanded over the complete set of the landau functions @xmath49 ( note that @xmath50 depends on @xmath26 ) .",
    "the adiabatic approximation would correspond to retaining only one term in this expansion .",
    "a _ bound state _ of the atom can be numbered as @xmath51 , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 relate to the leading term of the expansion ( [ expan ] ) , and @xmath54 enumerates longitudinal energy levels @xmath55 and controls the @xmath36-parity : @xmath56 . for a moving atom",
    ", this way of numbering is unambiguous at @xmath57 ( p94 ) .    since the transverse factors @xmath58 in equation ( [ expan ] )",
    "are known analytically , only the one - dimensional longitudinal functions @xmath59 are to be found numerically . for the bound states , numerical calculations ( vincke et al .",
    "1992 ; p94 ) yield the following . at small transverse generalized momenta @xmath60 , the states @xmath61 remain tightly bound and _ centered _ , with the electron cloud concentrated around the proton . for such states , the conventional representation ( @xmath29 )",
    "is appropriate . at large @xmath60 ,",
    "the states are _ decentered _ , with the electron localized in a potential well shifted apart from the proton .",
    "then @xmath30 is the apt choice . with growing @xmath2",
    ", the transition from the centered tightly - bound states to the decentered states occurs in a narrow range of @xmath2 near @xmath62 , and the shifted ( @xmath30 ) adiabatic approximation becomes fairly good at @xmath63 . for the hydrogen - like states",
    "@xmath64 , however , the mean electron - proton separation grows steadily , being close to @xmath17 at arbitrarily small @xmath60 , so that these states can be described by the shifted adiabatic approximattion at any @xmath60 .",

    "a _ continuum state _ can be numbered as @xmath68 , where @xmath69 and @xmath70 correspond to an open channel for the energy @xmath71 , and @xmath72 corresponds to a type of the final state  e.  g. , to a given @xmath36-parity or to a direction of electron escape , depending on asymptotic conditions . in the photoionization process",

    "a technique for calculating the longitudinal wavefunctions has been developed by ppv97 .",

    "since the coulomb interaction ceases to distort the transverse wavefunctions at infinity , the orbitals in equation ( [ expan ] ) become uncoupled at large @xmath36 provided that the full - shift representation ( @xmath82 ) of the continuum state is chosen .",

    "this reexpansion involves an additional summation index which runs over a huge number of values if the relative displacement is large enough , which renders the reexpansion method impractical at high @xmath2 .",

    "analytical calculation of @xmath96 is performed in the appendix . as a result",
    ", the interaction matrix element @xmath97 reduces to a sum of one - dimensional quadratures ( eq.[[m_final ] ] ) feasible for numerical evaluation .",

    "they give rise to sharp resonances in the cross sections at the photon energies corresponding to transitions between the initial bound state and the quasi - bound states .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] demonstrates a comparison of our numerical results ( solid lines ) with those obtained using approximations encountered in literature .",
    "the short - dash - dot curves are obtained using the velocity form of the interaction operator with the @xmath100-coupling `` switched - off '' ( @xmath100-adiabatic approximation ) .",
    "we see that this coupling is very important for evaluating the cross section @xmath101 ( for the left circular polarization transverse to the magnetic field ) and less important for the other two basic cross sections , @xmath102 ( right circular polarization transverse to the field ) and @xmath103 ( linear polarization along the field ) .",

    "this is in accordance with approximate equivalence of using the @xmath14-adiabatic approximation ( @xmath104 ) with the length form and using the velocity form with allowance for @xmath105 .",
    "this equivalence has been suggested by pp93 and proved by ppv97 under the condition that the non - adiabatic corrections were small .",
    "it fails for @xmath106 if the @xmath100-coupling is neglected ( compare dotted and dot - short - dash curves in the lower panels ) , but we have checked numerically that it holds if the @xmath107-coupling is included .",
    "the dot - long - dash curves correspond to the approach of bp94 .",
    "it differs from the plain shifted @xmath108-adiabatic approximation ( dotted curves ) by employing the orthogonalization of the final state with respect to the initial one ( see eq .  [ 32 ] of bp94 ) . at relatively small @xmath2 ( upper panels ) , this approximation yields qualitatively correct results . with increasing @xmath2 ,",
    "the approximate @xmath102 becomes progressively less accurate due to violation of the cylindrical symmetry of the continuum states of the atom ; for instance , it exceeds our cross section by a factor of @xmath109 at @xmath110 a.u .",

    "if to abandon the born approximation ( retaining the adiabatic one ) , then @xmath111 would become considerably lower , by 0.5 to 3 orders of magnitude for the parameters chosen in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , and even more different from the true cross sections",
    ". this lowering is due to the approximate orthogonality of the initial and final _ longitudinal _ wave functions , which is not provided by the born approximation .",
    "all the discussed approximations miss the beutler ",
    "fano resonances ( narrow peaks and dips near the thresholds ) , which occur at the energies of the quasi - bound states in the continuum .",
    "these resonances are analogous to those discussed by ppv97 , except that now these quasi - bound states all belong to the ( @xmath112)-manifold .",
    "autoionization in this case becomes possible due to the motion - induced coupling of different @xmath100-channels .    except for the missing resonances , the discussed approximations appear to be sufficiently accurate for the longitudinal ( @xmath103 ) polarization .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] demonstrates a representative sample of our numerical results for @xmath113 . in accordance with figure 1 ,",
    "the photoionization thresholds shift redward with increasing @xmath2 . since @xmath114 a.u . at this field strength",
    ", the left and right panels correspond to the centered and decentered atoms , respectively .    for the centered atoms ,",
    "the slopes of the curves for each given polarization remain practically coincident with those at @xmath115 .",
    "the values of the cross sections for the parallel and right polarizations , corresponding to the radiative transitions with @xmath116 and @xmath117 allowed at @xmath115 ( when @xmath15 is a `` good '' quantum number ) , decrease only slightly with increasing @xmath2 from 0 to @xmath118 . for the left polarization ,",
    "radiative transitions from the ground state are forbidden ( @xmath119 ) at @xmath115 ( pp93 ) . with growing @xmath2 , the coupling between different @xmath15-channels arises , and @xmath101 grows ( approximately as @xmath120",
    " see pm93 ) until it becomes comparable to @xmath102 at @xmath106 .    for the _ decentered _ atoms ( right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , the energy dependences steepen with growing @xmath2 .",
    "this is explained by the change of the effective potential from coulomb - like at @xmath121 to oscillator - like as the atom becomes decentered .",
    "the effective potentials corresponding to different @xmath15 become nearly identical , that results in a significant decrease of @xmath102 .",
    "still faster is the decrease of @xmath101 caused by restoring applicability of the @xmath15-adiabatic approximation and corresponding selection rules at large @xmath2 . at the same time , the threshold value of @xmath103 remains almost independent of @xmath2 .",
    "since the moving atom loses its cylindrical symmetry , the cross sections depend on the angle @xmath122 between @xmath1 and the transverse component of the wavevector .",
    "the @xmath122-dependence is most pronounced when both the wavevector @xmath75 and polarization direction @xmath84 are perpendicular to @xmath33 .",
    "the cross sections @xmath103 and @xmath123 are drawn in figure [ fig3 ] by dot - long - dash and dashed lines , respectively .",
    "the former cross section does not depend on @xmath122 in the dipole approximation , whereas the small non - dipole corrections ( eq .  [ [ mz ] ] ) cause a weak dependence with an amplitude @xmath124% .",

    "for the transverse polarization , the @xmath122-dependence becomes pronounced at @xmath125 a.u .",
    "the upper and lower dashed curves correspond to the largest and smallest possible values of @xmath126 , at @xmath127 and @xmath128 , respectively .",
    "the reason is that the transversely polarized photons `` see '' the largest transverse size of the atom ( stretched perpendicular to @xmath1 ) when they propagate along @xmath1 , and the smallest one when propagating transversely to @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath122-dependence between these two extremes , illustrated in figure [ fig4 ] , is described by the formula @xmath129 note that in the absence of coupling of different @xmath15-channels the amplitude @xmath130 in equation ( [ phi ] ) would equal @xmath131 , which is always greater than the actual value of @xmath130 , calculated numerically .",
    "the curve corresponding to @xmath132 ry in figure [ fig4 ] goes higher than that corresponding to @xmath133 ry because the ionization channel @xmath134 opens at @xmath135 ry , where @xmath136 is the proton cyclotron frequency .",
    "the curve corresponding to @xmath137 ry goes much higher than the other curves because it falls onto a slope of a beutler  fano resonance .",
    "such resonances are most prominent at @xmath106 ( cf .",

    "the divergence is eliminated if nonideality of the gas is taken into account . at high @xmath2 ,",
    "the binding energies become small , and atomic sizes become large .",

    "in particular , it considerably broadens the spectral lines and photoionization edges ( with a typical magnetic width @xmath168 ) , gives rise to additional absorption at low frequencies due to decentered atoms , and opens new transition channels forbidden for atoms at rest .",
