    "dark matter populates our universe , representing more than 80% of the total matter content . while astrophysical and cosmological measurements have elucidated the amount of dark matter ( dm ) in our universe as well as its role in galactic formation and distributions , we know very little about the nature of dm . for example , one of the few properties of dm that we can say anything with certainty is that dark matter has mass .",
    "but even the allowed mass values can span over 80 orders of magnitude , @xmath5 , with the lower bound coming from requirement of localization on galactic scales  @xcite and the upper bound from micro - lensing searches for compact halo objects  @xcite .    despite our ignorance ,",
    "we remain hopeful that theoretical models can provide a framework for experimentally probing dark matter directly and indirectly .",
    "for example , in this work we consider dark matter to be a weakly interacting massive particle that started its cosmic history in thermal equilibrium and froze - out as the universe cooled .",
    "the assumption of thermalization provides two powerful statements on dm : first , it restricts the allowed mass region to 11 orders of magnitude , @xmath6 , with the lower and upper bounds coming from the requirement that dark matter be cold  @xcite and its annihilation unitary  @xcite , respectively .",
    "second , if dm is a thermal relic , its annihilations must freeze - out to reach the observed current abundance , providing an estimate on the strength of dm interactions . in particular",
    ", assuming annihilation is @xmath7-wave dominated , in order to meet the observed abundance , freeze - out requires a weak scale cross - section that is nearly independent of mass , @xmath8 .",
    "after freeze - out , relic annihilations that occur may have observational consequences in two different scenarios .",
    "first , present day annihilations may be indirectly observed by searching the sky for their annihilation products ( for a review , see  @xcite ) . in the second scenario",
    ", relic annihilations can inject hadronic and/or electromagnetic energy that may alter events in our cosmic history , namely big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) and recombination ( cmb ) .",
    "because the physics of nucleosynthesis and recombination are well understood , they offer particularly clean environments in which to probe non - standard effects , such as dm annihilation .",
    "in addition , changes to bbn and cmb by non - standard processes depend only on the type and rate of energy injection into the bath , and therefore leave bbn and cmb essentially decoupled from the high - energy details allowing relatively model - independent statements to be made .    in this work ,",
    "we focus specifically on how relic annihilations from thermal dark matter affect nucleosynthesis . however , it is useful to describe in general how injected hadronic and electromagnetic energy alter nucleosynthesis and recombination . during nucleosynthesis ,",
    "injection of hadronic and/or electromagnetic energy alters the abundances of nuclei via ( i ) energetic nucleons and photons dissociating nuclei and ( ii ) pions inter - converting background nucleons , thus raising the @xmath9 ratio and therefore the primordial @xmath10he mass fraction . as for recombination ,",
    "injected electromagnetic energy ionizes hydrogen atoms and therefore broadens the surface of last scattering .",
    "this results in scale dependent changes to the temperature and polarization power spectra , especially in the low @xmath11 modes .    now that we live in an era of precision cmb and bbn measurements , quantifying the effect of energy injection has led to powerful constraints on non - standard effects such as decay of long - lived particles  @xcite and dark matter annihilation  @xcite . in the case of dark matter annihilation ,",
    "the primary result obtained from analysis of the injected energy on nucleosynthesis and recombination is an upper bound on the dm annihilation cross - section , @xmath12 , as a function of the dm mass .",
    "in particular , detailed analysis of the cmb has constrained @xmath7-wave annihilation to hadronic or electromagnetic channels to be less than the thermal cross - section required for freeze - out , @xmath13 , for @xmath14 gev  @xcite .",
    "studies of @xmath7-wave annihilation on bbn have been performed by hisano _ et .",
    "al . _ for @xmath15 gev  @xcite and separately by jedamzik and pospelov for @xmath16 several gev  @xcite , while lower mass regions have remained unconsidered .    from previous works  @xcite that consider the effect of dm annihilation on bbn",
    ", the constraint on the annihilation cross - section appears to have a simple power law dependence on the dm mass , @xmath17 , where the power for hadronic ( electromagnetic ) energy injection is @xmath18 (= 1 ) . in this work , we explain these scaling behaviors and the range of dm masses for which they hold . then we extrapolate the bounds to previously unconsidered dm masses and find that bbn constrains @xmath13 for @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) for the case of hadronic ( electromagnetic ) energy injection .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : in section ii we discuss how injection of hadronic and electromagnetic energy alters bbn , and in particular , how these effects scale with the dark matter mass and annihilation cross - section . in section iii , we use these scaling laws along with results from precise numerical treatment  @xcite to estimate constraints on dm annihilation in a previously unconsidered low mass region .",
    "our estimates indicate that bbn places a constraint on hadronic annihilation channels that is competitive and independent of the cmb constraint .",
    "we also discuss how these bounds change for annihilation to other standard model particles .",
    "finally , in section iv we conclude and discuss future prospects for this work .",
    "injected energy from dark matter annihilations occurring after @xmath21 mev can alter the primordial abundances of the light elements .",
    "details of the evolution of injected energy and its effects on nucleosynthesis are thoroughly discussed in  @xcite . quantifying the change on primordial abundances boils down to calculating the spectrum of produced hadron / nucleus @xmath22 .",
    "this spectrum , @xmath23 , is a complicated function that depends on the dynamics of the injected energy , the nuclear network leading to the production / destruction of @xmath22 , and the rate of dm annihilation . in this work ,",
    "we focus on the dependence of this spectrum on the dm s mass and annihilation cross - section .",
    "since production / destruction of @xmath22 begins with an annihilation event , @xmath24 is proportional to the dm annihilation rate , @xmath25 here , @xmath12 is the thermally - averaged annihilation cross - section which we take to be @xmath7-wave dominated and time independent and @xmath26 is the number density of dm . for the range of dm masses considered , bbn occurs after freeze - out and therefore the number density of dm is fixed by observational abundance @xmath27 hence , the dm injection rate scales as @xmath28 this has a simple physical interpretation : as dark matter mass decreases , in order to fit the observed abundance there needs to be more dm particles , which in turn leads to more annihilation events .",
    "in addition to the dm annihilation rate , the spectrum of produced / destroyed @xmath22 will depend on the dm mass through the dynamics of the type of energy injected , which we now consider .",
    "hadrons ( @xmath29 etc . )",
    "resultant from dm annihilation can primarily alter bbn through proton - neutron interconversion ( @xmath30 ) and hadro - dissociation ( @xmath31 )  @xcite .",
    "interconversion of @xmath32 and @xmath33 by energetic pions before the formation of d and @xmath10he ( @xmath34 kev ) can increase the @xmath9 ratio set by @xmath35 decoupling at @xmath36 mev .",
    "since almost all neutrons end up in @xmath10he ( see , _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) , the increase of @xmath9 leads to a larger @xmath10he primordial mass fraction , @xmath37 .",
    "energetic nucleons produced by dm annihilation alter primordial abundances through collisions with nuclei .",
    "the dominant effect of energetic neutrons and protons is to hadro - disassociate @xmath10he which in turn leads to an increased production of d , @xmath38h , @xmath38he , and @xmath39li .",
    "electromagnetic interactions with background photons and electrons tend to thermalize the nucleons , so hadro - dissociation only becomes efficient when the universe dilutes enough so that the electromagnetic interactions lose their stopping power .",
    "this occurs below @xmath34 kev for neutrons and @xmath40 kev for protons  @xcite . because the primordial abundance of @xmath10he is much larger than other nuclides ( for example , @xmath41 ) , bbn is more sensitive to enhanced production of other nuclides than to processes which alter the primordial @xmath10he abundance . therefore , hadro - dissociation of @xmath10he leading to increased production of other nuclides  namely d , @xmath38h , @xmath38he , and @xmath39li  provides the most stringent constraints from bbn .    since we wish to understand the change in a given nuclide s primordial abundance as a function of @xmath12 and @xmath42 , we consider how the amount of hadro - dissociation depends on these parameters .",
    "as in equation  , the amount of hadro - dissociation is proportional to the dark matter annihilation rate , @xmath43 . since hadro - dissociation proceeds through energetic nucleons , further dependence on @xmath42 essentially comes from the number of energetic nucleons produced in an annihilation event , _",
    "i.e. _ the nucleon multiplicity  @xcite .",
    ", that is of interest .",
    "the dependence of this spectrum on @xmath44 comes from the low @xmath45 behavior of the parton fragmentation functions @xmath46 .",
    "the dependence of the multiplicity on @xmath47 shown in the text is inherited from @xmath48 s dependence on @xmath47  @xcite . ] assuming annihilation into quarks , @xmath49 , the nucleon multiplicity can be approximated by the multiplicity in @xmath50 collisions at @xmath44 . to leading order in qcd , the average charged particle multiplicity has the following dependence on @xmath47  @xcite : @xmath51 where @xmath52 , @xmath53 is the renormalization scale , and @xmath54 and @xmath55 are constants . apart from overall normalization , for @xmath44 above several gev , the above is well approximated by @xmath56 with @xmath57 .",
    "the dependence of the amount of hadro - dissociation on the rate of dm annihilation and the nucleon multiplicity implies that the boltzmann term for production / destruction of nuclei @xmath22 approximately scales with dm as : @xmath58_{\\text{hadronic } } \\propto m_{\\ch}^{1/2 } \\frac{\\avg{\\s v}}{m_{\\ch}^2 } = \\frac{\\avg{\\s v}}{m_{\\ch}^{3/2 } } \\label{eqn : hadronic_scaling}\\ ] ] this scaling is expected to hold down to @xmath59 few gev , below which hadro - dissociation quickly goes to zero since an annihilation event can no longer produce nucleons .",
    "this behavior implies that constraints on @xmath12 from bbn approximately scale as @xmath60 , which is confirmed by precise numerical calculations for @xmath61 gev  @xcite and shown in figure  [ fig : bounds ] .",
    "electromagnetic showering of energetic photons and leptons in the early universe produces many photons  @xcite which can photo - dissociate nuclei and alter primordial abundances  @xcite .",
    "photo - dissociation is a significant effect only when the energetic photons do not thermalize .",
    "precise calculations of the evolution of electromagnetic cascades in the early universe can be found in the literature  @xcite , but the dominant effects are easily understood .",
    "because of the small baryon - to - photon ratio , @xmath62 , photons will pair produce off background photons ( @xmath63 ) if their energy is above the threshold energy , @xmath64 .",
    "therefore , photo - dissociation only becomes efficient when the binding energy drops below the threshold for pair production .    of the possible photo - dissociation channels , destruction of @xmath10he dominates since @xmath10he is the most abundant of the light nuclei by a few orders of magnitude .",
    "since @xmath65 mev , photo - dissociation of @xmath10he does not become relevant until @xmath66 kev .",
    "the dominant photo - dissociation channels of @xmath10he are to @xmath38h or @xmath38he plus a nucleon  @xcite .",
    "therefore , photo - dissociation of @xmath10he most noticeably leads to overproduction of @xmath38he ( @xmath38h decays to @xmath38he with a half - life of about 14 years ) .",
    "overproduction of d and @xmath39li may also result from @xmath10he photo - destruction . in the case of deuterium",
    ", it can be directly produced in photo - spallation of @xmath10he  @xcite or in capture of the neutron from @xmath67 on a background proton .",
    "non - thermal production of @xmath39li may occur if the spallation product @xmath38h or @xmath38he is captured on a background @xmath10he , @xmath68 or @xmath69 . because the observed abundance of @xmath39li is very small , non - thermal production of @xmath39li via photo - dissociation of @xmath10he can have a noticeable impact  @xcite .",
    "assuming annihilation into radiative channels ( @xmath70 or @xmath71 ) , we wish to extract how production / destruction of nuclei @xmath22 due to photo - dissociation depends on dm mass . as in the case of hadro - dissociation ,",
    "the amount of photo - dissociation is proportional to the amount of dm annihilation , @xmath72 .",
    "the amount of photo - dissociation also depends on the number of photons produced in an annihilation event and the subsequent electromagnetic cascade . because there is no mass gap for the photon , the number of photons produced is proportional to the visible energy ( @xmath73 and @xmath74 ) from the annihilation event , @xmath75  @xcite .",
    "for example , annihilation to electrons or muons have @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively .",
    "the amount of photo - dissociation implies that the boltzmann term for production / destruction of nuclei @xmath22 due to photo - dissociation is inversely proportional to the dm mass , @xmath58_{\\text{p.d . } } \\propto \\frac{\\avg{\\s v}}{m_{\\ch } } \\left(\\frac{e_{\\text{vis}}}{m_{\\ch}}\\right ) .",

    "relic dark matter annihilations alter the primordial abundances of nuclei from standard bbn predictions . in the case of @xmath7-wave annihilation ,",
    "as discussed in the previous section , the scaling of these effects on dm mass and annihilation cross - section is given in equations   and   for hadronic and radiative annihilation channels , respectively .",

    "@xcite as a starting point , the observational abundances used to place bounds are the same as in that work .",
    "these observational abundances are discussed in appendix  [ app : obs_abund ] .",
    "as discussed in equation  , constraints on @xmath12 from hadronic energy injection are approximately proportional to @xmath88 where @xmath89 comes from the dependence of the nucleon multiplicity on @xmath44 ; @xmath90 is approximately proportional to @xmath91 .",
    "as @xmath42 approaches a gev , this scaling is expected to break down and constraints on @xmath12 to rapidly weaken since annihilations no longer produce energetic nucleons that dissociate background @xmath10he .",
    "the scaling @xmath92 assumes the dominant effect on primordial abundances is hadro - dissociation of background @xmath10he .",
    "while hadro - dissociation does dominate , there may be other processes which contribute a small but non - negligible amount .",
    "for example , dm annihilations may further enhance primordial d , @xmath38he , and @xmath39li abundances through ( 1 ) photo - dissociation of background @xmath10he by energetic photons produced in the hadronic jet and from electromagnetic energy loss and ( 2 ) more background @xmath10he to dissociate from @xmath93 interconversion by pions at @xmath94 kev .",
    "while these contributions are sub - dominant to hadro - dissociation of background @xmath10he , precise numerical treatment is needed to evaluate the relative size and scaling with @xmath42 of all possible effects .",
    "the scaling behavior with @xmath42 might also be modified by the number of secondary energetic nucleons produced from hadro - dissociation processes , although this effect is subdominate  @xcite .",
    "our goal in this work is to derive conservative estimates .",
    "therefore , to parametrize our ignorance on the interplay of all effects in calculating constraints on @xmath12 for a given mass , we include an uncertainty in the scaling @xmath95 where we take the uncertainty to be @xmath96  @xcite .",
    "in ref  @xcite the authors consider annihilation into @xmath97 quarks , @xmath84 . from the primordial deuterium abundance they derive an upper bound @xmath98 for @xmath99 gev .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : bounds ] , the scaling   implies @xmath100 for @xmath101 for annihilation to bottom quarks , the constraint is cutoff at @xmath102 gev . while the above constraint is for @xmath84 , similar results are anticipated for annihilation to other quark species .",
    "however , in the case of annihilation to lighter quarks , we expect the constraint on @xmath12 falls off as @xmath103 , but where and how rapidly this occurs can only be obtained from numerical analysis .",

    "the photo - dissociation cross - section for @xmath10he , @xmath108 , proceeds through the giant dipole resonance and only becomes efficient when @xmath109 mev  @xcite .",
    "an electron from the dm annihilation event with @xmath110 near this threshold produces energetic photons via inverse - compton scattering off background photons .",
    "inverse - compton scattering is a relatively hard event , with @xmath111 of the momentum transferred to the scattered photon .",
    "therefore we expect the constraints on @xmath104 from @xmath38he overproduction to fall off around 30 mev .",
    "the constraints   and   for hadronic and electromagnetic energy injection are obtained from dm annihilation to @xmath112 and @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "it is useful to consider how these constraints would change for different annihilation channels .",
    "nucleosynthesis is sensitive to the amount of hadronic and electromagnetic energy injected into the bath and is therefore essentially decoupled from the high energy details of the dark matter annihilation .",
    "therefore , in order to understand how different dm annihilation channels alter bbn , it is sufficient to specify the annihilation products and ask what particles are produced in the resulting hadronic and/or electromagnetic cascade .    in the case of annihilation into hadronic channels",
    ", we do not anticipate the constraints from different quark species ( @xmath113 ) to change much from the case of annihilation to bottom quarks .",
    "injected hadronic energy primarily alters bbn through dissociation of nuclei by energetic nucleons resultant from the hadronization of the initial state quarks . at energies much larger than the nucleon mass ,",
    "the spectrum of nucleons does not significantly depend on the initial state quark .",
    "as the dm mass gets near the nucleon mass , @xmath114 , the nucleon spectrum from hadronization will differ between initial state quark species .",
    "for lighter quark species , the main change from the constraint for @xmath84   is that the bounds will fall off at a dm mass lower than @xmath102 gev .",
    "therefore , for annihilation to quarks , we generically expect @xmath115 for @xmath116 where the lower limit comes from the inability to produce energetic nucleons in the annihilation event and will have a slight dependence on initial quark species , beyond the precision of these estimates .",
    "annihilation to photons , electrons , or muons will alter bbn through the injection of electromagnetic energy . from equation  ,",
    "constraints on the dm annihilation cross - section are inversely proportional to the amount of injected visible energy ( electrons and photons ) , @xmath117 in the case of annihilation to photons or electrons @xmath76 . for annihilation to muons ,",
    "@xmath77 and therefore the constraints on @xmath12 for @xmath118 are weakened by a factor of @xmath119 from the case of @xmath85 .",
    "therefore , we estimate that @xmath38he overproduction bounds @xmath120 and is valid for @xmath121 .",
    "bbn constraints on annihilation to taus , @xmath122 , come from the injection of electromagnetic energy from the @xmath123 decay products . despite the large hadronic branching fraction in the @xmath123 decay , since @xmath124 , annihilation to @xmath123 s can not produce nucleons which would alter nucleosynthesis through hadro - dissociation of @xmath10he .",
    "while the hadronic products of @xmath123 decay ( pions and kaons ) will slightly affect the primordial @xmath10he mass fraction through interconversion of background @xmath33 and @xmath32 at @xmath125 , they predominantly alter standard bbn through the electromagnetic energy in their decay products . taking the average fraction of visible energy in a @xmath123 decay to be 0.31  @xcite , overproduction of @xmath38he from photo - dissociation of @xmath10he bounds @xmath126 .",

    "the relative amount of charged lepton production via neutrino radiation of a weak boson is approximately @xmath134 for @xmath135 and can be as large as @xmath136 when the weak boson is radiated on shell .",
    "thus , depending on the energy of the initial neutrino , both the high energy neutrinos themselves and branching to multi - body final states can have the same order - of - magnitude effect on nucleosynthesis , which is what was found in  @xcite .",
    "based on these considerations , we estimate that bounds on annihilation to neutrinos are weaker than bounds on radiative annihilation channels by @xmath137 for @xmath16gev and by @xmath138 for @xmath139 gev . for this reason ,",

    "recently , @xmath39li has been observed in the these systems as well  @xcite , although the total number of systems with observable @xmath39li is somewhat controversial due to observational difficulties in distinguishing @xmath39li and @xmath149li spectra  @xcite .",

    "the observed abundance is lower by a factor of about three than the theoretical value predicted by standard bbn , with a @xmath150 significance . in the case of @xmath39li ,",
    "the observed abundance is more than a factor of @xmath151 larger than the standard bbn prediction .",
    "while the solution to the lithium problems may be unknown , a conservative approach , as used in  @xcite , is to take the observed @xmath39li and @xmath149li abundances as upper limits for their primordial abundances .",
    "there is also an extra uncertainty in the primordial abundances that comes from the possibility that stellar burning may deplete primordial @xmath39li and @xmath149li  @xcite . in this case",
