    "to colour a graph is to label its vertices so that no two adjacent vertices have the same label .",
    "we call the labels _ colours_. in a graph colouring problem one typically seeks to colour a graph using as few colours as possible , or perhaps simply to decide whether a given number of colours is sufficient .",
    "graph colouring problems are central to the study of both structural and algorithmic graph theory and have very many theoretical and practical applications .",
    "many variants and generalizations of the concept have been investigated , and there are some excellent surveys  @xcite and a book  @xcite on the subject .",
    "we survey _ computational complexity _ results of graph colouring problems ( for a short survey see  @xcite ) .",
    "as we will note in the following subsection , the complexity of many graph colouring problems is fully understood when the possible input is any graph , and it is therefore natural to study the complexity of problems where the input is restricted .",
    "for example , one well - known result for graph colouring is due to grtschel , lovsz , and schrijver  @xcite who have shown that the problem of whether a _ perfect _ graph can be coloured with at most @xmath0 colours for a given integer @xmath0 is polynomial - time solvable ; in contrast , the problem for general graphs is np - complete  @xcite .",
    "perfect graphs are an example of a graph class that is closed under vertex deletion , and , like all such graph classes , can be characterized by a family of forbidden induced subgraphs ( an infinite family in the case of perfect graphs ) . in recent years , colouring problems for classes with forbidden - induced - subgraph characterizations have been extensively studied , and this survey is a response to the need for these results to be collected together .",
    "in fact , such a task is beyond the scope of a single paper and so our aim here is to report on the computational complexity of graph colouring problems for graph classes characterized by the absence of _ one or two _ forbidden induced subgraphs ( for a survey on computational complexity results and open problems for colouring graphs characterized by more than two forbidden induced subgraphs or for which some graph parameter is bounded , see  @xcite ) .",
    "we consider finite undirected graphs with no multiple edges and no self - loops .",
    "that is , a graph @xmath5 is an ordered pair @xmath6 that consists of a finite set @xmath7 of elements called _ vertices _ and a finite set @xmath8 of unordered pairs of members of @xmath7 called _",
    "edges_. the sets @xmath7 and @xmath8 are called the _ vertex set _ and _ edge set _ of @xmath5 , respectively , and an edge containing @xmath9 and @xmath10 is denoted @xmath11 .",

    "theorem 6 of broersma et al .",
    "@xcite states that @xmath61-precolouring extension can be solved in polynomial time on @xmath184-graphs for any fixed @xmath115 . in the proof of this theorem a polynomial - time algorithm is presented that takes as input a graph @xmath1 and a set of precoloured vertices @xmath29 .",
    "we can copy the proof when the input is a graph and a @xmath61-list assignment after defining @xmath153 to be the set of all vertices with a list of at most 2 admissible colours .",
    "let @xmath135 be a graph class that is closed under adding dominating vertices , for which colouring is np - complete .",
    "consider an instance @xmath577 of colouring where @xmath5 belongs to @xmath135 and @xmath147 is an integer .",
    "we may assume without loss of generality that @xmath578 for all @xmath579 , as otherwise we add dominating vertices to @xmath5 and increase @xmath0 accordingly , in order to obtain a pair @xmath580 such that @xmath15 is @xmath581-colourable if and only if @xmath5 is @xmath0-colourable , and by the definition of @xmath135 , @xmath15 would belong to @xmath135 as well .",
    "we now define @xmath582 and construct a graph @xmath583 from @xmath5 by adding a set of @xmath584 vertices @xmath585 that are adjacent to each other and to every vertex of @xmath5 . by the definition of @xmath135 , we derive that @xmath583 belongs to @xmath135 .",
    "we prove that @xmath5 is @xmath0-colourable if and only if @xmath583 is @xmath586-choosable .",
    "first suppose that @xmath583 is @xmath586-choosable .",
    "then @xmath583 has a colouring @xmath24 that respects the list assignment @xmath587 with @xmath588 for all @xmath589 . because the @xmath584 vertices in @xmath122 are mutually adjacent , they are all coloured differently by @xmath24 .",
    "moreover , because every vertex of @xmath122 is adjacent to every vertex of @xmath5 , no vertex in @xmath5 has the same colour as a vertex in @xmath122 .",
    "hence , by taking the restriction of @xmath24 to @xmath12 , we find that @xmath5 is @xmath0-colourable .    now suppose that @xmath5 is @xmath0-colourable .",
    "we prove that @xmath583 is @xmath586-choosable . in order to do this ,",
    "let @xmath587 be an arbitrary @xmath586-list assignment of @xmath583 .",
    "we will construct a colouring of @xmath583 that respects @xmath590 .",
    "we start by colouring the vertices of @xmath122 and , if possible , reducing @xmath583 by applying the following procedure :    * as long as there is an uncoloured vertex @xmath591 such that @xmath592 contains an unused colour @xmath272 and there is a vertex @xmath579 with @xmath593 , do as follows : give @xmath594 colour @xmath272 and delete all vertices @xmath579 for which at least @xmath595 used colours are not in @xmath596 . * afterwards , consider the vertices of the remaining set @xmath597 one by one and give them any unused colour from their list .",
    "it is possible to colour all vertices of @xmath122 by this procedure , because @xmath598 for @xmath599 and @xmath600 .",
    "we must show that the procedure is correct .",
    "let @xmath579 .",
    "after colouring all vertices of @xmath122 we can partition @xmath122 into two sets @xmath601 and @xmath602 , where @xmath601 consists of those vertices of @xmath122 that received a colour not in @xmath596 and @xmath603 consists of those vertices of @xmath122 that received a colour from @xmath596 .",
    "then the number of available colours for @xmath9 is @xmath604 , whereas @xmath9 still has @xmath91 uncoloured neighbours in @xmath583 .",
    "if @xmath605 , or equivalently , if @xmath606 , then we may delete @xmath9 ; after colouring all vertices of @xmath607 , we are guaranteed that there exists at least one colour in @xmath596 that is not used on the neighbourhood of @xmath9 in @xmath583 , and we can give @xmath9 this colour .",
    "after colouring the vertices in @xmath122 as described above , we let @xmath608 denote the subset of vertices of @xmath12 that were not deleted while colouring @xmath122 .",
    "recall the set @xmath609 defined in the procedure .",
    "we distinguish two cases .",
    "first suppose @xmath610 .",
    "then every @xmath611 received a colour that does not appear in the list @xmath596 for at least one vertex @xmath579 that was not yet deleted from the graph at the moment @xmath555 was coloured .",
    "consequently , the size of some set @xmath601 increases by  @xmath612 whenever a vertex of @xmath122 receives a colour . recall that a vertex @xmath613 is deleted from the graph as soon as the size of @xmath601 reaches @xmath595 . since @xmath614 , every vertex of @xmath12 is deleted from the graph at some point during the procedure .",
    "hence @xmath615 , implying that @xmath583 is @xmath586-choosable due to the correctness of our procedure .",
    "now suppose @xmath616 and let @xmath617 . because @xmath618 and @xmath619 , the list @xmath620 contains a set @xmath621 of @xmath0 colours that are not used as a colour for any vertex in @xmath122 ( including @xmath622 itself ) .",
    "we will show that @xmath623 for every @xmath613 . for contradiction ,",
    "suppose there exists a colour @xmath624 and a vertex @xmath625 such that @xmath626 .",
    "by the definition of @xmath609 , vertex @xmath622 received a colour @xmath627 that appears in the list @xmath596 for every @xmath613 . but according to our procedure , we would not have coloured @xmath622 with colour @xmath627 if colour @xmath628 was also available ; note that @xmath628 is not used to colour any vertex in @xmath629 by the definition of @xmath621 .",
    "this yields the desired contradiction , implying that @xmath623 for every @xmath613 . by symmetry of the colours",
    ", we may assume that @xmath630 .",
    "we assumed that @xmath5 is @xmath0-colourable , so @xmath5 has a colouring @xmath631 , and we can safely assign colour @xmath20 to each @xmath613 . due to this and the correctness of our procedure , we conclude that @xmath583 is also @xmath0-choosable when @xmath616 ."
