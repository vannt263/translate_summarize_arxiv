    "while kohn - sham ( ks ) density functional theory ( dft)@xcite has found very broad application for the simulation of interatomic bonding , its computational cost still places limitations in its application when treating the length scales necessary for the strain fields from dislocations@xcite or light elements in metals.@xcite furthermore as the system size grows the number of configurations needed for thermodynamic integration becomes intractable .",
    "this makes the use of computationally efficient parameterized methods attractive .",
    "the continued interest in parameterized methods also comes from the obvious wish to gain physical insight . in this respect one of the most successful methods",
    "is the tight - binding ( tb ) method .    in its conventional form the tb method models the total energy as a repulsive pair potential and a bonding many - body term .",
    "the bonding energy is obtained by solving a two - center slater - koster ( sk ) hamiltonian.@xcite following tbs empirical introduction several conceptual advances , mainly the tb bond model@xcite , the harris - foulkes functional@xcite and the related second - order expansion of the ks energy@xcite have been made . together",
    "these provide an appealing conceptual framework , but in practice there are several `` philosophies '' on how the parameterization should be performed and the success of tb depends on this parameterization.@xcite    there is thus a demand for tb parameterizations based as closely as possible on the dft energy functional . in the present paper",
    "we construct an orthogonal tb model for iron .",
    "special focus is put on using a limited number of fitting parameters without compromising the predictive quality of the model .",
    "we demonstrate how the formal link between dft linear combination of atomic orbitals ( lcao ) methods and two - center tb may be used to obtain the tb bonding energy .",
    "this is achieved by down - folding a pseudo - atomic orbital ( pao ) basis onto a minimal basis set .",
    "we demonstrate the transferability of both basis functions and bond - integrals , thereby validating the two - center approximation .",
    "we show how the resulting tb model for iron correctly predicts the energetic ordering of the low energy iron - phases , including the ferromagnetic ( fm ) bcc , antiferromagnetic ( afm ) fcc and topologically close - packed structures .",
    "finally , we test the transferability of the model on the vacancy formation energy in the nm - fcc and fm - bcc iron lattices .",
    "in lcao the basis functions are written as product of a radial part with an angular function _ ij(*r*)=_ijlm(*r*)=u_ijl(r)y_lm ( * * ) [ eq : ao ] we use the capital indexes @xmath1 and @xmath2 to label atoms and the index @xmath3 as a condensed index for the angular character @xmath4 .",
    "we leave out the principal quantum number as we only treat the valence states .",
    "while minimal basis sets use just one basis function for each valence atomic orbital , the variational flexibility of lcao basis sets can be improved by adding several radial functions for a given angular momentum , so - called multiple-@xmath5 basis functions . the index @xmath6 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ao ] ) counts the number of radial functions for a given angular character @xmath3 .",
    "furthermore higher spherical harmonics , so - called polarization functions , are often added to further improve the basis . by expanding the kohn - sham ( ks ) orbital wave functions in terms of a basis set = _ ij c_ij^(n ) [ eq : basis ] the ks equations can be written in matrix form , which introduces the hamilton and overlap matrices _",
