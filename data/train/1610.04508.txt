    "our result implies that clusters of galaxies may occupy a non - negligible fraction of the bright x - ray sources towards the galactic bulge . because of low galactic latitudes , moderate x - ray absorption as well as severe optical extinction hampers detailed spectroscopic studies of the clusters in the bulge region .    in this paper , we report the results of the suzaku and chandra observations of 1rxs j170047.8@xmath0314442 .",

    "coming back to the xis data , we indicate regions to extract the source and background spectra with a white solid circle and a white dashed ellipse , respectively , in figure  [ fig : xray_images]a .",
    "we selected the source - extraction region with a radius of @xmath40 so that the surface brightness at the boundary reduces to @xmath41% of the peak brightness .",
    "the center of the circle was chosen to be @xmath42 .",

    "thus , we divided the source - extraction region into three regions , designated as `` bright spot '' , `` north '' , and `` south '' , for the following spectral analysis . meanwhile , the source - extraction region was defined explicitly to be `` whole source '' region hereafter .",

    "we need a 2-dimensional distribution of the x - ray intensity of 1rxs j170047.8@xmath0314442 . since the observed x - ray emission was not axisymmetric , we first made a radial profile of the surface brightness from a sector shown in figure  [ fig : xray_images]a , where the north - western bright spot was removed .",
    "the resultant radial profile is shown in figure  [ fig : radial_profile ] .",

    "thus , for simplicity of the arf calculation , we modelled this emission as a single point source .",
    "after subtracting the simulated images of the grxe , cxb , nxb , and @xmath5-model components from the raw xis image , we determined the source position to be @xmath66 .",
    "the normalization of the point source was set so as to reproduce the ratio of the observed x - ray counts between the point source and @xmath5-model components .",

    "<S> we present the chandra and suzaku observations of 1rxs j170047.8@xmath0314442 , located towards the galactic bulge , to reveal a wide - band ( @xmath1@xmath2  kev ) x - ray morphology and spectrum of this source . with the chandra observation , </S>",
    "<S> no point source was found at the position of 1rxs j170047.8@xmath0314442 . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , we revealed the presence of diffuse x - ray emission by the wide - band x - ray image obtained from the suzaku xis . </S>",
    "<S> although the x - ray emission had a nearly circular shape with a spatial extent of @xmath3 , the surface brightness profile was not axisymmetric ; a bright spot - like emission was found at @xmath4 away in the north - western direction from the center . </S>",
    "<S> the radial profile of the surface brightness , except for this spot - like emission , was reproduced with a single @xmath5-model ; @xmath5 and the core radius were found to be @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray spectrum of the diffuse emission showed an emission line at @xmath8  kev , indicating an origin of a thermal plasma . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum was well explained with an absorbed optically - thin thermal plasma model with a temperature of @xmath9  kev and a redshift parameter of @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the x - ray emission was considered to arise from the hot gas associated with a cluster of galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> our spectroscopic result confirmed the optical identification of 1rxs j170047.8@xmath0314442 by @xcite : ciza j1700.8@xmath03144 , a member of the cluster catalogue in the zone of avoidance . </S>",
    "<S> the estimated bolometric x - ray luminosity of @xmath11  erg  s@xmath12 was among the lowest with this temperature , suggesting that this cluster is far from relaxed . </S>"
