    "* the shape problem*.   all current models involving magnetic fields assume that a radiation driven fast post - agb ( asymptotic giant branch ) wind carries a ( frozen - in ! ) stellar toroidal magnetic field , travelling into a non - magnetized radiation driven slow agb wind .",
    "however , it is not clear whether this kind of magnetic shaping can be applied to nonaxisymmetric _ multipolar _",
    "structures that have been observed by the hubble space telescope .",
    "the multipolar structures suggest that two winds are interplaying , emanating at the same time from the star and a surrounding _ ( accretion ) disc _ , a scenario which has not been considered in previous models .",
    "* the power problem*.   all current models assume that the winds are purely radiation driven .",
    "there is observational evidence that the pn - shaping process begins already in the ppn phase , because many ppns have highly collimated fast bipolar outflows .",
    "however , at this early stage of evolution , a post - agb star is too cool to produce a high speed ( radiation driven ! ) fast wind with the observed large kinetic luminosity .",
    "therefore , the _ origin _ of fast ppn winds can not be radiation , as assumed in previous models .    * the proposed model*.   blackman et al .",
    "( 2001b,2001a ) propose that large scale dynamos in the post - agb star as well as a surrounding ppn accretion disc might drive mhd stellar and disc winds , so that ppns / pns are formed by _",
    "dynamo driven stellar and disc winds _ rather than radiation driven stellar winds .    * our work*.   we aim , in the future , to verify the proposed semi - quantitative physical model with _ global numerical mhd simulations_. as a first step , we present here results of axisymmetric numerical simulations of three mhd models of a system comprised of a central object , a surrounding accretion disc and a corona .",
    "all three models have mean - field dynamo action in the disc and do not impose any external magnetic field in the disc , which is a new approach in the context of outflows and accretion studies .",
    "model  a assumes an initially non - magnetized star , whereas models  b and c include a strong stellar dipolar magnetosphere and a stellar mean - field dynamo , respectively .",
    "our models are currently applied to protostellar star  disc systems . however , since we use dimensionless variables , the models can be rescaled and applied to a range of different astrophysical objects .",
    "we solve the continuity equation , the navier  stokes equation and the induction equation . instead of solving the energy equation , we model a cool dense disc embedded in a hot rarefied corona by fixing entropy contrasts such that specific entropy is smaller within the disc and the star , and larger in the corona . by solving the hydrostatic equilibrium for an initially non - rotating corona",
    ", the corona is pressure - supported , whereas the disc is mainly centrifugally supported and rotating slightly sub - keplerian .",
    "the results of model  a have been presented in more detail in von rekowski et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . as one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( left ) , a clearly structured outflow develops with a slower , hotter and denser stellar wind , an inner disc wind ( in a conical shell originating from the inner disc edge ) that is faster , cooler and less dense , and an outer disc wind with intermediate values .",
    "the stellar wind is pressure driven ( very low angular momentum , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( right ) ; ratio of the poloidal magneto - centrifugal to pressure forces is less than @xmath0 at the stellar surface ) , whereas the inner disc wind is magneto - centrifugally accelerated ( very high angular momentum ; magnetic field lines at the disc surface are inclined to the rotation axis by at least @xmath1 ; outflow is highly supersonic but sub - alfvnic : magnetic lever arm is about @xmath2 ; ratio of the poloidal magneto - centrifugal to pressure forces is larger than @xmath0 at the disc surface and exceeds @xmath3 further away ) , and the outer disc wind is mostly pressure driven ( alfvn surface is close to the disc surface ; ratio of the poloidal magneto - centrifugal to pressure forces is mostly less than or around @xmath0 at the disc surface ) .",
    "the averaged accretion rate is about @xmath4 and the averaged disc @xmath5 stellar wind mass loss rate is about @xmath6 .      the results of model  b have been presented in more detail in von rekowski & brandenburg ( 2003a ) .",
    "again , the disc dynamo produces a structured disc wind so that the overall outflow is similar to model  a , with coexisting pressure driving and magneto - centrifugal acceleration . in transition periods",
    "when disconnected stellar and disc field lines are about to reconnect , there is a pressure driven hot and dense , but relatively fast outflow between the stellar and disc winds ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , left ) .",
    "the magnetosphere is oscillating with a period of around 15 to 30 days , changing between two distinct states .",
    "when star and disc are magnetically connected by the magnetosphere , accretion of disc matter onto the star is along magnetospheric field lines with peak accretion rates of about @xmath7 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , middle ) .",
    "when star and disc are magnetically disconnected , there is no net accretion but matter is lost directly into the outflow ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , right ) . in this state , angular momentum transport by the inner disc wind",
    "is clearly enhanced ; also the stellar and inner disc wind velocities are enhanced .",
    "the disc wind mass loss rates are also time dependent but not correlated with the oscillating magnetosphere ; they are about one order of magnitude higher than the peak accretion rates",
    ".      the results of model  c are going to be presented in more detail in von rekowski & brandenburg ( 2003b ) .",
    "the stellar dynamo generates a magnetic field with dipolar - type symmetry ( the alpha effect is positive in the upper hemisphere ) .",
    "the main result is that the dynamo in the star produces a fast and collimated stellar wind ( cf .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the structured disc wind is again due to the disc dynamo .",
    "use of the supercomputers sgi 3800 in linkping and linux cluster 1 in umeand of the pparc supported supercomputers in st andrews and leicester is acknowledged .",
