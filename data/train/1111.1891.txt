    "omega  centauri ( @xmath2  cen ) is one of the most intriguing globular clusters ( gcs ) of the galaxy . at odds with the majority of gcs , which are mono - metallic",
    ", it shows large star - to - star metallicity variations up to more than one dex ( e.g.  norris , freeman & mighell 1996 , suntzeff & kraft 1996 ) . at the same time",
    ", it shares with the most mono - metallic gcs the presence of a na - o anticorrelation , which is present across almost the entire metallicity range ( marino 2011a , johnson & pilachowski 2010 ) .",
    "these two facts suggest unique complexity in the cluster s star - formation history , and its chemical evolution .",
    "the complexity of @xmath2  cen also manifests itself in its color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) with the presence of multiple red - giant ( rgbs ) , multiple sub - giant branches ( sgbs , lee 1999 , pancino 2000 ) , and an extended horizontal branch ( villanova 2007 ; cassisi 2009 , dantona , caloi & venura 2010 ; bellini 2010 ) . the main sequence ( ms ) is double ( anderson 1997 ) , and a third , less - populated ms has been discovered by bedin ( 2004 ) and associated with the most metal - rich population .",
    "the bluer ms ( bms ) has a higher metallicity than the red ms ( rms , piotto 2005 ) .",
    "so far , the only way to account for these observations is to assume the bms to be highly enhanced in he ( norris 2004 ; bedin 2004 ; piotto 2005 ) .",
    "direct evidence in this directions has been recently detected from the analysis of the he i 10830 transition on @xmath2  cen rgb stars ( dupree 2011 ) .",
    "the correlation of the he line detection with [ fe / h ] , al and na supports the assumption that helium is enhanced in the bms .    due to the observational scenario , more complex than in any other gc , it has often been suggested ( e.g.  bekki & freeman 2003 ) that @xmath2  cen may be the remnant of a now - dissolved dwarf galaxy ,",
    "once similar of the sagittarius dwarf ( with its central globular cluster m54 ) now being thorn apart by the galactic tidal field . in any case",
    ", a successful description of the @xmath2  cen star - formation history should be able to explain both the na - o anticorrelation at the various metallicities and the general rise in slow - process ( ) elements as a function of metallicity ( norris & da costa 1995 ; johnson & pilachowski 2010 ; smith 2000 ; marino 2011a ) .",
    "the presence of the na - o anticorrelation implies that @xmath2  cen , similarly to mono - metallic gcs , has experienced enrichment from high - temperature h - burning processed material . at the same time",
    ", an additional physical mechanism should be present to produce  elements . in the sun ,",
    "the  elements abundance is mainly due to two components : the main component ( attributed to low - mass agb stars of 1.5 - 3@xmath3 ; busso , gallino & wasserburg 1999 ) and the weak component ( attributed to massive stars ; see raiteri et al .",
    "1993 , and references therein ) . at solar metallicity",
    ", this last component mainly produces the lighter  nuclei , at most up to sr and kr ( raiteri et al .",
    "1993 ) . in the case of @xmath2  cen ,",
    "if we assume that the @xmath4-elements are produced in the strong component , i.e. in a population of less massive asymptotic - giant - branch ( agb ) stars ( busso 1999 , ventura 2009 ) , we have to face a timescale discrepancy that makes hard to solve the entire puzzle ( dantona 2011 ) .",
    "indeed , these agb have longer lifetimes than the more massive agb stars , which are presumed responsible for the he enrichment and for na - o anticorrelations .",
    "if , alternatively , the  elements are produced in the weak component by massive stars that explode as type ii supernovae , it remains to be seen whether the models can produce elements as heavy as ba and la in stellar environments characterized by the chemical abundances observed in @xmath2  cen .",
    "an important ingredient to understand the star - formation history of this poorly - understood gc is the determination of the relative ages of its stellar populations .",
    "numerous studies based on cmd analysis combined with metallicity distribution of turnoff ( to ) and sgb stars have yielded conflicting results , suggesting age differences from less than 2  gyr ( lee 2005 , sollima 2005 , calamida 2009 ) , up to 5  gyrs ( villanova 2007 ) .",
    "rapid - formation scenarios wherein the entire cluster could have formed within a few times @xmath5 years have recently been suggested by dantona ( 2011 ) and valcarce & catelan ( 2011 ) .",
    "theoretical isochrones show that a variation of the total c+n+o abundance can have an effect on the gc ages obtained from cmd fitting .",
    "therefore , the relative age - dating of the stellar populations hosted in the cluster would be severely affected by the presence of c+n+o differences among the @xmath2  cen sub - populations ( cassisi 2008 , ventura 2009 , pietrinferni 2009 , dantona 2009 ) .    in an effort to shed light on these issues ,",
    "in this paper we measure the overall c+n+o abundance in 77 rgb stars of @xmath2  cen , which span nearly its entire metallicity range .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows : in section  [ sec : data ] we describe the data analysis ; results are presented in section  [ sec : results ] , and their impact on the chemical enrichment scenario and the age measurements are discussed in section  [ sec : scenarios ] and section  [ sec : discussion ] , respectively ; section  [ sec : conclusions ] is a summary of our results .",
    "our data - set consists in a sample of 77 rgb stars observed with the flames / giraffe hr4 setup ( program : 082.d-0424a ) .",
    "we also have , from marino ( 2011a ) , additional spectra for the same stars with different giraffe setups , from which we have derived abundances for fe , na , o , and @xmath6-capture element la ( 75%  in the solar system , simmerer 2004 ) . in marino ( 2011a )",
    "we provide meaurements also for ba abundances , but here we prefer to use only la as representative of @xmath6-capture elements because ba measurements are more uncertain , since the only analyzed ba transition is a blend ( see marino 2011a ) .",
    "we refer the reader to this paper for a more detailed description of the sample and the data reduction . here",
    "we analyse , for 77 stars of the marino ( 2011a ) sample , chemical abundances for carbon and nitrogen .",
    "the hr4 setup covers the spectral range from @xmath04188 to @xmath04392   , providing a resolution @xmath720,000 .",
    "the typical signal - to - noise ratio of the final combined spectra at the central wavelength of the spectral range is @xmath080 .",
    "our abundance analysis used the local thermodynamic equilibrium analysis code moog ( sneden 1973 ) .",
    "carbon was measured from spectral synthesis of the g - bandheads ( @xmath8 ) near 4314 and 4323   .",
    "the nitrogen abundance was derived from synthesis of the cn blue - system ( @xmath9 ) bandhead at @xmath04215   .",
    "the synthesis line list for the blue cn band is described in hill ( 2002 ) .",
    "the line list for the ch band was provided by b. plez ( private communication ) .",
    "synthetic spectra were employed by using castelli & kurucz ( 2004 ) models for effective temperatures ( ) , gravities ( ) , metallicities , and microturbolences ( ) determined in marino ( 2011a ) . in computing the c abundance we used the previously determined o contents ( marino 2011a ) , and for n , both observed c and o abundances needed to be employed . as an example , we show in figure  [ sintesi ] the spectral synthesis for the ch and cn bands , and the o line for star # 248664 . for more details on the atmospheric - parameter determinations , and a discussion on related uncertainties ,",
    "we refer to marino ( 2011a ) . here , we focus on the c and n measurements .    the error analysis for c and n was performed by varying , , metallicity , and  for several stars , and redetermining the abundances .",
    "the parameters were varied by @xmath10=@xmath11100 k , @xmath10=@xmath110.20 , @xmath10=@xmath110.10  km / sec , and metallicity by 0.10 dex .",
    "in addition , the derived c abundance is dependent on the o abundance and therefore so is the n abundance , and the circulation of correlated errors tends to mimic the effects of cno - cycle burning ( e.g.  iben & renzini 1983 ) .",
    "indeed , in the red giant atmospheres carbon is mainly present in the co molecules , and in the molecular equilibrium an over - estimation in oxygen produces an over - estimation of carbon from the ch band , and viceversa . in the cn bands ,",
    "a carbon over - estimation causes nitrogen to be under - estimated .    in the treatment of the internal errors for carbon",
    ", we then varied the oxygen abundance by @xmath110.10 , and repeated the spectrum synthesis to determine the error introduced by uncertainties in the o abundances .",
    "these errors were then added in quadrature to the errors introduced by atmospheric parameters and yielded an overall error of @xmath120.10 dex to the [ c / fe ] abundances . for nitrogen",
    "we varied both o and c , the latter by @xmath110.10 dex .",
    "we added these errors in quadrature with those introduced by the model atmosphere and estimated the internal uncertainty of the [ n / fe ] values to be @xmath00.20 - 0.30 .",
    "carbon and nitrogen abundances for @xmath2  cen rgb stars were determined by brown & wallerstein ( 1993 ; 6 stars ) , norris & da costa ( 1995 , 40 stars ) , and stanford , da costa , & norris ( 2010 ; 33 stars ) .",
    "a proper comparison with these studies can not be made because there are no stars in common , however we note that our c and n values span a range similar to that of brown & wallerstein ( 1993 ) and stanford ( 2010 ) .",
    "possible systematic differences in c could not be excluded between our stars and those of stanford et al .",
    ", while systematically lower n abundances ( of @xmath00.50 dex ) were found by norris & da costa ( 1995 ) .",
    "in marino ( 2011a ) we derived the o abundance from the line at 6300   by comparing our observations with synthetic spectra that had solar c and n. here , we redetermine oxygen by adopting in the synthesis the measured n and c abundances .",
    "these improved [ o / fe ] measures are in good agreement with the previous measurements , with only few stars differing by more than 0.1 dex from the values in marino ( 2011a ) .",
    "figure  [ ele ] plots the abundances of c , n , and o ( tab .",
    "1 ) measured in this paper and the na measurements from marino ( 2011a ) . we observe large star - to - star variations in all of these elements , as has already observed in all the gcs studied to date .",
    "carbon spans a range from [ c / fe]@xmath10.9 to [ c / fe]@xmath130.6 .",
    "most stars are c - depleted , but there is a population of stars with [ c / fe]@xmath140.0 .",
    "nitrogen spans almost 2 dex , from [ n / fe]@xmath00.0 to stars with [ n / fe]@xmath01.8 dex .",
    "there is only one star ( # 214842 ) that is enhanced in both c and n ( figure  [ ele ] , panel c ) .",
    "our results show the existence of well - defined patterns among c , n , o , and na .",
    "a positive correlation is present between o and c , and between na and n , and n anticorrelates with o ( figure  [ ele ] , panels a , b , d ) .",
    "a c - n anticorrelation is not obvious ( panel c ) , but it can be more easily recognizable by grouping stars on the basis of different fe content , as will be discussed in section  [ cnofe ] .",
    "such chemical patterns indicate the occurrence of high - temperature h - burning involving the cno and nena cycles , and are consistent with prediction in ventura & dantona ( 2009 ) .    in the following sections we present the pattern of c , n , o abundances with [ fe / h ] ( section  [ cnofe ] ) and with respect to the position of stars on the na - o anticorrelation ( section  [ cnoona ] ) studied by marino ( 2011a ) .",
    "[ abundances ]    .carbon , nitrogen and oxygen abundances ratios relative to iron for the analyzed stars the full table is only electronically available . [ cols=\"<,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab1 ]    this result confirms that the measurement of relative ages of stellar populations in gcs requires accurate measurements of the overall c+n+o abundance .",
    "indeed , it is well known that the double sgbs detected in ngc  1851 , m22 , 47  tucanae ( milone 2008 , 2011 , anderson 2009 , piotto 2009 ) , can be interpreted in quite different ways , depending on the cno content of the single populations . in particular , the faint sgb can be associated either with a stellar population significantly older than the stars in the bright sgb ( up to 1  gyr ) , or to a second generation , almost coeval with the brighter sgb ( age differences of 100 - 200  myr ) , but with enhanced cno ( cassisi 2008 , ventura 2009 ) .",
    "this scenario has received further support by recent findings in m22 by marino ( 2009 , 2011b ) : this gc hosts two stellar groups with different @xmath4-element and cno abundances , and , in addition , the two groups of cno - rich and cno - poor stars have also different iron abundances , in close analogy with @xmath2  cen",
    ".    in ngc  1851 , results on possible internal variations of c+n+o are contradicting ( yong 2009 , villanova 2010 ) .",
    "however , theoretical models , properly accounting for photometric signatures of the chemical peculiarities observed in the cluster sub - populations as provided by sbordone ( 2011 ) , suggest that in ngc  1851 only a c+n+o - enhanced second generation can satisfy all the observational constraints given by cmds in various photometric bands ( milone 2008 , han 2009 ) .",
    "many studies have attempted to reconstruct the evolutionary history of @xmath2  cen , by determining relative ages among the different stellar sub - groups , but none has been able to account for variations in the overall c+n+o abundance .",
    "considering the complexity of its sgb morphology , and of the metallicity distribution , and different assumptions regarding he enhancement among @xmath2  cen populations , the relative ages for the various stellar populations as measured in different studies are quite different , ranging from a small or null age dispersion , as proposed by sollima ( 2005 ) , to an age spread of the order of 2 - 3  gyr ( hilker 2004 , stanford 2006 ) to 4 or more gyr ( hughes & wallerstein 2000 , hilker & richtler 2000 , villanova 2007 ) .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to evaluate in detail how c+n+o abundances change the age - dating obtained in the multiple cited works .",
    "however , we can identify some general trends .",
    "by using the same @xmath15-enhanced isochrones adopted here , villanova ( 2007 ) found a large age difference ( @xmath05 gyrs ) among the @xmath2  cen populations .",
    "specifically they identify four groups of stars : ( 1 ) an old metal - poor group ( [ fe / h]@xmath11.7 ) , ( 2 ) an old population of metal - rich stars ( [ fe / h]@xmath11.1 ) , ( 3 ) a group of metal - intermediate young stars ( [ fe / h]@xmath11.4 ) , about 1 - 2  gyr younger than the old components , and ( 4 ) a young metal - poor group ( [ fe / h]@xmath11.7 ) up to @xmath05  gyr younger than the old populations . when accounting for the cno overabundance and using appropriate cno - enhanced isochrones , the age estimate of the metal - rich component in villanova should be decreased by @xmath02  gyrs .",
    "as a consequence , the metal - rich population is no longer coeval with the most metal - poor population , but is slightly younger . similarly , due to its enhanced cno content , the intermediate metallicity ( [ fe / h]@xmath11.4 ) population would be younger by @xmath01  gyr relative to the estimates given by these authors .",
    "on the other hand , the age difference between the two groups of old and young metal - poor stars should not change as they have the same iron and cno content .",
    "hilker ( 2004 ) and stanford ( 2006 ) suggest that @xmath2  cen has experienced a prolonged star - formation of @xmath02 - 4  gyrs but , at odds with villanova ( 2007 ) , with the most metal - rich stars being younger .",
    "similar conclusions have been reached either by hughes & wallerstein ( 2000 ) and hilker & richtler ( 2000 ) , who estimated that the more metal - rich stars were younger than the metal - poor ones by @xmath163  gyrs , and 3 - 6  gyrs respectively . in the case of hilker ( 2004 ) and",
    "stanford ( 2006 ) , we predict that cno effects on the relative - age estimate could increase the duration of the star - formation in @xmath2  cen up to @xmath04 - 6  gyrs .",
    "sollima ( 2005 ) suggest that the global star - formation history of @xmath2  cen should be confined to within @xmath02  gyrs , with the metal - poor population ( [ fe / h]@xmath11.7 ) representing the first and the major star - formation burst .",
    "our results suggest that the ages of the metal - intermediate and metal - rich stars given by these authors could be over - estimated by @xmath00.6 and @xmath01.5  gyrs , with respect to the metal - poor population . in any case , given their uncertainties of 2  gyrs , these corrections do not change the main result of their work , e.g.  the suggestion that @xmath2  cen stellar populations formed in a short time period .",
    "as mentioned above , the goal of this paper is not do a detailed analysis of previous age determinations . as discussed before there are contradicting results in recent literature .",
    "our aim is simply to show that there is significant variation in the c+n+o content among @xmath2  cen s populations that may easily change these datations .",
    "in addition to that caveat , it is worth noting that he enhancement is likely present in the o - poor , metal - rich stars .",
    "this occurrence should be taken into account when measuring the relative ages via isochrones fitting among the various sub - populations , since he affects the sgb shape ( but not the luminosity level ) .",
    "in this paper , we have presented c , n , o abundances for 77 @xmath2  cen rgb stars in the metallicity range @xmath12.0@xmath17[fe / h]@xmath180.9 .",
    "we have coupled our results with the ones of our previous work on na - o - la abundances presented in marino ( 2011a ) . from our analysis",
    "we found :    * a correlation between the total cno and the iron abundance , with the most metal - rich population being enhanced by @xmath00.5 dex in [ ( c+n+o)/fe ] relative to the most metal - poor one ; * o and c grows with [ fe / h ] and [ la / fe ] in the o - rich / na - poor stars .",
    "* stars selected on the basis of their position on the na - o plane , show defined chemical patterns in their light elements c , n , o , and na as a function cno , fe , and la , that allow us to distinguish between a _ first _ and a _ second generation _ of stars , each possibly resulting from a series of separate bursts of star formation . *",
    "[ la / fe ] correlates tightly with [ fe / h ] , following almost precisely the same trend regardless of the o / na abundances .    in an attempt to make sense of this observational trends",
    "we have explored two ( speculative ) scenarios for the formation and evolution of this most puzzling object . in one option",
    "the system has evolved _ monolithically _ , i.e. , remaining chemically homogeneous at each time .",
    "thus , within less than @xmath19 myrs a series of bursts of star formation each enriched in iron and @xmath15 elements by core - collapse supernovae from the previous burst(s ) would have been followed each by a secondary burst of star formation originated from material ejected by agb stars , heavily processed by @xmath20-captures .",
    "the formation of the whole stellar population inhabiting the cluster today would have taken less than @xmath21 yrs .",
    "alternatively , rather than sequential in time , such primary and secondary bursts of star formation would have taken place separately in space , before their products could merge at the bottom of the potential well . in both cases ,",
    "secondary bursts would be fed via cooling flows made of agb ejects , leading to more centrally concentrated _ second generations _ , which indeed appears to be so in this ( and other ) clusters ( sollima 2005 , bellini 2009 , johnson & pilachowski 2010 ) .",
    "we admit that both scenarios require a series of very contrived and _ ad hoc _ assumptions , yet the extraordinary complexity of @xmath2  cen may not admit simple solutions .",
    "the cno abundance affects the determination of the relative ages of cluster subpopulations via isochrone fitting of the turnoff sgb region . in the light of our results",
    ", we have discussed this issue in the case of @xmath2  cen by comparing isochrones with standard and with enhanced cno , with the latter ones giving younger ages for the same turnoff luminosity .",
    "although the determination of relative ages of @xmath2  cen sub - populations is beyond the aims of our study , we argue that a trend in cno / fe can help reducing large age spread among the various sub - populations , as found by some studies in the literature .",
