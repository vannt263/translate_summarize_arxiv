    "among the widely debated questions in nuclear physics , we can mention the one related to the nuclear equation of state and its extrapolation to extreme conditions . even restricting to zero temperature",
    ", the nuclear community is still striving to determine the behaviour of the energy per particle in uniform matter as a function of density and neutron - proton asymmetry .",
    "the energy as a function of the neutron - proton asymmetry or , in turn , the so - called symmetry energy ( cf .",
    "below for a precise defintion ) is of particular interest because of its impact on the physics of exotic , neutron - rich or neutron - deficient , nuclei .",
    "it also affects in an important fashion the properties of some astrophysical compact objects like the neutron stars .",
    "topical conferences address the problem of the determination of the nuclear symmetry energy , and the reader can consult a recent topical volume to check the present status of our understanding @xcite .",
    "one can expect that the study of isovector modes of finite nuclei can shed light on the problem of the determination of the symmetry energy and of its density dependence . in the isovector collective motion , protons are displaced with respect to neutrons : in other words , one creates locally a neutron - proton imbalance .",
    "thus , the response of the nucleus to this perturbation is related to the variation of the energy density as a function of asymmetry .",
    "however , the nucleus is different from uniform matter : not only shell effects , or pairing , are expected to play a role , but isospin is not a good quantum number and the separation of isoscalar and isovector motion raises some concern .",
    "we briefly discuss some works that are related with the constraints on the symmetry energy emerging from the analysis of isovector properties of finite nuclei , and we stress the consistency of the results we have obtained .",
    "then , we introduce covariance analysis as a rigorous way to determine whether extracting constraints on the symmetry energy from isovector observables is justified or not . until recently ,",
    "covariance analysis has not been object of much interest by nuclear theorists .",
    "we introduce its basic concepts and try to make the reader familiar with the idea that there is a quantitative fashion to determine whether two quantities @xmath0 and @xmath1 are correlated or not , whenever calculated in a given framework . in the present context , @xmath0 and @xmath1 could be , respectively , a parameter characterizing the density behaviour of the symmetry energy and an isovector observable",
    ". our discussion will be nevertheless more general .",
    "our analysis is based on energy density functional ( edf ) calculations @xcite .",
    "we will show that the correlations that emerge are not universal but _ will , to some extent , depend on the chosen model . _",
    "we assume that the nuclear systems , as any fermi system , can be described in terms of a _ local _ energy functional .",
    "this implies that we can write their total energy as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the energy density and @xmath4 and @xmath5 are , respectively , neutron and proton densities . instead of @xmath4 and @xmath5",
    ", one can use the total density @xmath6 and the _ local _ neutron - proton asymmetry , @xmath7 in asymmetric matter , we can make a taylor expansion of @xmath8 in @xmath9 and retain only the quadratic term ( odd powers of @xmath9 are forbidden due to isospin symmetry ) , @xmath10 the first term on the r.h.s . is the energy density of symmetric nuclear matter while the second term defines the the symmetry energy @xmath11 .",
    "the expansion ( [ def_sym ] ) should continue with a quartic and possibly with higher order terms in @xmath9 ; however , the coefficient of the term in @xmath12 is , to the best of our knowledge , found to be negligible in most models at the densities of interest for this work @xcite .",
    "if we focus on the density dependence of @xmath13 close to the usual nuclear density we can define @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the saturation density for symmetric nuclear matter , @xmath16 0.16 @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath18 is often referred to as the `` slope parameter '' .",
    "we shall , in what follows , discuss how these parameters can be extracted from the comparison between theoretical calculations and experimental measurements of the properties of isovector states .",
    "the theoretical calculations are done using the hartree - fock ( hf ) plus random phase approximation ( rpa ) framework .",
    "we do not provide here information about this well - known scheme .",
    "the details of our implementation , together with a general introduction , can be found in ref .",
    "the case of the most collective and well known isovector giant resonance , namely the isovector giant dipole resonance ( ivgdr ) , has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . in that work ,",
    "the starting point is the hydrodynamical model proposed by e. lipparini and s. stringari  @xcite .",
    "if one denotes by @xmath19 the @xmath20-th moment associated with the strength function of an external operator @xmath21 , the ivgdr energy can be evaluated within the framework of the hydrodinamical model if defined as @xmath22 .",
    "the result is @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the volume and surface coefficients of the macroscopic symmetry energy and @xmath26 is the well - known `` enhancement factor '' , which in the case of skyrme forces is associated with their velocity dependence @xcite .",
    "the coefficient @xmath24 can be identified with @xmath27 ; if the nucleus had a sharp surface this would be the only quantity appearing in the previous expression .",
    "the nuclear surface does manifest itself in the correction @xmath28 . to connect this with the microscopic symmetry energy @xmath13 , one can rewrite this correction and assume that the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ els ] ) in a heavy nucleus does not scale as @xmath29 , but rather as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is some value of density below the saturation density @xmath15 . in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been found that such a correlation between @xmath32 ( calculated within hf - rpa ) and @xmath30 exists , with @xmath31 around 0.1 @xmath17 for heavy nuclei",
    "( in agreement with @xcite ) . by exploiting this correlation and inserting the experimental value for the ivgdr energy in @xmath33pb",
    ", it has been found that @xmath34      it is a natural question to ask whether the isovector giant quadrupole resonance ( ivgqr ) provides a consistent extraction of the density dependence of the symmetry energy . until recently ,",
    "the experimental properties of the ivgqr had not been determined very accurately ; this goal has been achieved using a very intense and polarized photon beam at the hi@xmath35s facility @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a comprehensive theoretical analysis has been performed , based both on rpa calculations and on a macroscopic interpretation .",
    "the energy of the ivgqr receives contribution from unperturbed particle - hole ( p - h ) configurations at 2@xmath36 excitation energy , plus some correlation energy related to the isovector residual interaction .",
    "this idea has been implemented in ref .",
    "@xcite , with mild assumptions and taking care of the fact that the unperturbed p - h energy can be related to the effective mass and , in turn , to the isoscalar gqr energy .",
    "the main result is @xmath37^{1/2 } , \\label{ex - ivgqr-3}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the fermi energy for symmetric nuclear matter at saturation density , and @xmath39 is the symmetry energy at some average nuclear density . if we take for this the same value that we have adopted in the above discussion for the ivgdr , that is , 0.1 @xmath17 , we can reproduce the experimental ivgqr energy ; to turn it around , from the two experimental ivgdr and ivgqr energies we can derive consistent values for the value of @xmath40 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been checked , in addition , that both skyrme and relativistic mean - field models follow quite well the scaling predicted by eq .",
    "( [ ex - ivgqr-3 ] ) .",
    "in fact , new skyrme interactions have been fitted in ref .",
    "@xcite using the same protocol as in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the new set sami has been introduced ; moreover , new effective lagrangians have been fitted along the line of the dd - me one @xcite .",
    "these sets are characterized by different values of @xmath41 and of the effective mass @xmath42 .",
    "the microscopic results obtained with sets having the same value of @xmath42 have been used as follows .",
    "the ivgqr energy can be reproduced only with forces having a specific combination of @xmath41 and @xmath18 ; if we assume a value of @xmath41 = 32@xmath431 mev we extract @xmath44 the second line corresponds to the neutron skin in @xmath33pb , that is well known to be correlated with @xmath18 @xcite .      among isovector modes ,",
    "the so - called `` pygmy dipole resonance '' ( pdr ) has captured noticeable interest in the last decade .",
    "this definition is not free from ambiguities if used to label generically the dipole strength below the ivgdr .",
    "experimentally , low - lying dipole strength has been found in several nuclei @xcite .",
    "typically , the pdr strength may arrive up to a few % of the dipole ewsr .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been proposed that the fraction of ewsr exhausted by the pdr and the slope parameter @xmath18 defined in eq .",
    "( [ parameters ] ) are correlated .",
    "this correlation could be explained if pdr is a mode related to the oscillation of the excess neutrons , whose dynamics is decoupled from the ivgdr ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a transparent interpretation ) .",
    "however , this picture may break in some cases .",
    "the collectivity of the pdr seems to be somewhat model - dependent , and the states in that energy region have also a mixed isovector / isoscalar character @xcite .",
    "a toroidal component has been found in the calculations of refs .",
    "@xcite . despite these well - taken warnings ,",
    "the values of the slope parameter and neutron skin ( for @xmath33pb ) that have been extracted in @xcite , namely @xmath45 are consistent with the previous values given in eq .",
    "( [ l - gqr ] ) and ( [ dr - gqr ] ) .",
    "the total dipole polarizabilty @xmath46 is proportional to the inverse - energy weighted sum rule @xmath47 of the dipole operator , the exact relationship being @xmath48 the correlations between this quantity , calculated by means of a large bunch of edfs , and either the slope parameter @xmath18 or the neutron skin has been analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in that work , however , the correlation shows up very clearly only within families made up with similar models .",
    "in fact , with the help of the droplet model ( dm ) , it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the slope parameter @xmath18 is well correlated with the product of @xmath41 times the dipole polarizability . the formula suggested by the dm is @xmath49,\\ ] ] where the quantities appearing in the second term within square brackets are defined in @xcite and shown to not vary appreciably among models ( at least in heavy systems like @xmath33pb @xcite ) .",
    "microscopic calculations obey such kind of scaling quite well and allow extracting , assuming @xmath50 mev , the value @xmath51",
    "all the above discussion is simply based on the empirical appearance of a linear correlation between two observables when they are calculated using several models like edf parameterizations .",
    "this kind of analysis is not based on any statistical assumption ( models are assumed to be independent ) but could be justified if the correlation under study is suggested by macroscopic models . a different strategy to judge about correlations between observables is to use covariance analysis .",
    "the advantage is that there is a more rigorous statistical foundation for such a method ; however , this can be used only to judge whether correlations exist _ within the framework of a given model , whose parameters are varied without changing the ansatz or the fitting protocol of such parameters . _",
    "although this will not be our focus here , covariance analysis is interesting for several more reasons .",
    "it allows estimating the theoretical errors on the model parameters and thus , decide if some of them is underconstrained or even redundant .    for the sake of brevity we do not give here a thorough explanation of the method of covariance analysis .",
    "we refer to our recent work @xcite for better explanations , reminding also that many textbooks contain a more exhaustive treatment of the formalism ( see e.g. @xcite ) , and that an excellent introduction for nuclear theorists is given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "let us consider a model , like an edf one , characterized by @xmath52 parameters @xmath53 .",
    "observables ( @xmath0 ) are functions of these parameters .",
    "usually one builds the optimal model , in the space defined by the @xmath52 parameters , by @xmath54 minimization .",
    "let us also assume that the @xmath54 is a well behaved , analytical hyper - function of the parameters around their optimal value @xmath55 , and that it can be approximated there by a taylor expansion , namely @xmath56 where we have defined the curvature matrix @xmath57 and its inverse which is the covariance ( or error ) matrix @xmath58 .",
    "let us now expand an observable @xmath59 around the minimum @xmath55 assuming a smooth behavior and , therefore , neglecting second order derivatives : @xmath60 the covariance between two observables is defined as @xmath61 using the above expansion for the observables , and the fact that the parameters they depend upon are expected to have a gaussian distribution with curvature matrix @xmath57 , one can write @xmath62 the variance of @xmath0 is , then , given by @xmath63 . one may also calculate the pearson - product moment correlation coefficient between those observables , that is , @xmath64 @xmath65 means complete correlation between observables @xmath0 and @xmath1 , whereas @xmath66 means complete anti - correlation and @xmath67 means no correlation at all .",
    "several results obtained via the covariance analysis have been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", we only focus on some illustrative findings that are of relevance in connection with our previous discussion on symmetry energy and other isovector observable .",
    "we have fitted a functional called sly5-min , that has been built so that to be as close as possible to the original sly5 force @xcite .",
    "details and differences are highlighted in ref .",
    "we now illustrate what happens to correlations between observables when one varies the fitting protocol .",
    "the original sly5 functional , and the present sly5-min functional as well , has been fitted by including in the @xmath54 as pseudo - data a set of values for the neutron matter equation of state derived by some _ ab - initio _ calculation with realistic forces @xcite . in the variant that we label as sly5-a",
    ", we have changed in the @xmath54 the weight associated with these pseudo - data , that is , with the equation of state of neutron matter . in particular , we have increased the value of the error on these points , @xmath68 , from @xmath69  that corresponds to a 10% relative error  to @xmath70 .",
    "the pearson - product correlation coefficients of this fit are shown in panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "one can notice a strong correlation between the isovector observables , that are , the neutron radius of @xmath71pb , @xmath72 , @xmath18 and @xmath47(ivgqr ) .",
    "this result clearly indicates that _ when a constraint on a property @xmath0 is relaxed , correlations with other related observables @xmath1 not included in the fitting protocol become larger .",
    "_    the second variant we have built is denoted as sly5-b . in this case",
    ", we have kept all terms in the @xmath54 as in sly5-min except the equation of state of neutron matter that now is not included at all , and we added instead a very tight constraint on the neutron skin thickness of @xmath71pb : we have chosen @xmath73 fm . then , panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows another interesting outcome : @xmath74 displays an almost vanishing correlation with all the other quantities .",
    "this indicates that _ when a property @xmath0 is tightly constrained in the fitting protocol , correlations with other observables @xmath1 become very small . _",
    "the most important outcomes of our recent works on the constraints on the density dependence of the symmetry energy imposed by the properties of isovector excitations are    * if one looks at correlations between observables and values or derivatives of the symmetry energy , calculated using a large set of different edfs , consistent values of @xmath18 and of the neutron skin thickness in @xmath33pb are extracted from the study of the ivgdr , ivgqr , pdr and total dipole polarizability [ cf . , in particular , eqs .",
    "( [ l - gqr ] ) , ( [ l - pdr ] ) , ( [ l - dpol ] ) as well as eqs .",
    "( [ dr - gqr ] ) , ( [ dr - pdr ] ) ] ; * some of these correlations are suggested by macroscopic models and , in general , we believe that it would be desirable that correlations emerge from a sound physical picture rather than simply from a numerical analysis ; * models may , or may not , display the correlations that one expects on physical grounds because of the strong impact of the fitting protocols .",
    "we have shown that correlations of an observable @xmath0 with related observables @xmath1 may emerge ( vanish ) if the constraint put on @xmath0 in the fitting protocol is negligible ( very tight ) ."
