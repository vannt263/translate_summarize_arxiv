    "the main mission of the nasa _ kepler _ spacecraft , launched 2009 march 7 , is to search for earth - sized planets around sun - like stars using high precision ccd photometry to detect planetary transits ( borucki et al.2010 ) . as a secondary mission objective , _",

    ", excellent ground - based data can be combined with extremely high signal - to - noise long time series _ kepler _ photometry to provide constraints for asteroseismology .",
    "the position of @xmath1cyg in the hr  diagram is among known @xmath5dor pulsators , suggesting the possibility that it may exhibit high - order gravity mode pulsations , which would probe the stellar interior just outside its convective core .",
    "@xmath1cyg is also cool enough to exhibit solar - like p - mode acoustic oscillations , which would probe both the interior and envelope . @xmath1cyg",
    "s projected rotational velocity @xmath6 is @xmath7kms@xmath8 ( erspamer & north 2003 ) .",
    "if the inclination angle of the rotation axis is not too large , @xmath1cyg s slow rotation should simplify mode identification and pulsation modeling , as spherical approximations and low - order perturbation theory for the rotational splitting should be adequate .",
    "@xmath1cyg has been the object of recent adaptive optics observations ( desort et al .",
    "it has a resolved binary m - dwarf companion of @xmath90.35m@xmath10 with separation 46au . following the orbit for nearly an orbital period ( unfortunately , @xmath11y )",
    "will eventually give an accurate dynamical mass for @xmath1cyg .",
    "also , the system shows a 150-d quasiperiod in radial velocity , suggesting that possibly one or more planets could accompany the stars .",
    "the revised hipparcos parallax of @xmath12milliarcseconds ( van leeuwen 2007 ) gives a distance of @xmath13pc , which , combined with an estimate of its apparent bolometric luminosity ( van belle et al .",
    "2008 ) , gives @xmath14l@xmath10 .",

    "nordstrm et al.(2004 ) give a mass @xmath18m@xmath10 , and age1.5 + 0.6/-0.7gyr using strmgren photometry plus the padova stellar model grid .",
    "@xmath1cyg has also been the object of optical interferometry observations .",
    "van belle et al.(2008 ) used the palomar testbed interferometer to identify 350 stars , including @xmath1cyg , that are suitably pointlike to be used for as calibrators for optical long - baseline interferometric observations .",
    "they then used spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting ( not the interferometry measurements ) based on 91 photometric observations of @xmath1cyg to estimate its angular diameter to be @xmath19milliarcseconds . combining this estimate with the revised hipparcos parallax ,",
    "the interferometric radius is @xmath20r@xmath10 .",
    "if one uses only the literature @xmath21 and @xmath22 and their associated error estimates , the derived radius is @xmath23r@xmath10 .",
    "optical interferometry has the potential to constrain the radius of @xmath1cyg better than spectroscopy and photometry alone . at this conference",
    "we learned of unpublished interferometric measurements by t. boyajian using the chara array .",
    "boyajian measures an angular diameter , @xmath24milliarcseconds , somewhat larger than the sed fitting estimate of van belle et al . , and",
    "giving a radius @xmath25r@xmath10 and associated @xmath26k , considerably different from the literature values .",
    "additional observations and analyses are necessary to reconcile and refine the observed properties of @xmath1cyg for comparison with those that we hope to derive from its pulsation frequencies measured by _ kepler_.    .@xmath1cyg models and observational constraints [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "@xmath1cyg was observed 2010 june@xmath2september ( _ kepler _ quarter 6 ) .",
    "it is the brightest star on active silicon in the _ kepler _ field of view , and is 7 magnitudes brighter than the saturation limit .",
    "_ kepler _ stars are observed using one of a set of masks that define the pixels to be stored for that star . for @xmath27 ,",
    "these masks grow prohibitively large .",
    "special apertures can be defined to better conform to the distribution of charge for extremely saturated bright stars .",
    "for @xmath1cyg the number of recorded pixels was reduced from @xmath2810000 to @xmath91300 by using a special aperture . both short - cadence ( 58.8s ) and long - cadence ( 29.4min ) data were obtained .",
    "fig.1 shows the 90-d unprocessed light curve .",
    "@xmath1cyg was not well - captured by the dedicated mask for @xmath950% of the quarter ( a problem that is now resolved ) , so 42d of the best - quality data were used in the pulsation analysis ( fig.2 ) .",
    "these data were processed to remove outliers and a small remaining trend before fourier analysis . the frequency power spectrum ( fig.3 )",
    "shows a rich spectrum of overtones of solar - like oscillations , with detectable modes in the range from approximately 1200 to 2500@xmath4hz .",
    "the appearance of the oscillation spectrum is very similar to that of two other well - studied f stars : procyon  a ( bedding et al .",
    "2010 ) and hd49933 ( appourchaux et al . 2008 ) .",
    "the envelope of oscillation power is very wide , and modes are evidently heavily damped , meaning the resonant peaks have large widths in the frequency spectrum , which makes mode identification difficult ( see , e.g. , bedding & kjeldsen 2010 ) .",
    "the frequency of maximum mode amplitude shifts to higher frequency with decreasing stellar mass . for comparison ,",
    "the peak in the sun s power spectrum is at about 3000@xmath4hz .",
    "it is clear from the _ kepler _ data that @xmath1cyg is a solar - like oscillator .",
    "however , the granulation noise and background are too high at low frequencies with the short data set to tell whether there are also modes with low frequencies around 11@xmath4hz ( or 1d@xmath8 ) characteristic of @xmath5dor g - mode pulsators ( see grigahcne et al . 2010 and references therein ) .",
    "it is hoped that further observations of @xmath1cyg will reduce the noise level to reveal longer - period @xmath5dor pulsations , as it would be advantageous to find a star that shows both @xmath5dor and solar - like oscillations to help constrain the properties of the stellar interior and test the physics of stellar evolution and pulsation models .",
    "to determine whether @xmath5dor - like g modes could be present in a star such as @xmath1cyg , we calculated stellar models that match the @xmath21 and @xmath22 inferred from the ground - based observations .",
    "we calculated the evolutionary tracks of two models , one with mass 1.38m@xmath10 and @xmath29 , close to the present photospheric @xmath30 of the sun ( that has decreased from its initial value due to diffusive settling during the sun s lifetime ) is the mass fraction of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium ] using the grevesse & noels ( 1993 ) solar mixture , and a model with mass 1.29m@xmath10 and @xmath31 , close to the asplund et al .",
    "( 2005 ) solar abundance determination .",
    "we used the opal ( iglesias & rogers 1996 ) opacities , initial helium mass fraction @xmath32 , and mixing length / pressure scale height ratio 1.9 .",
    "we did not include diffusive settling or convective overshoot .",
    "fig.4 shows an hr  diagram of the evolution tracks and a box bounding the@xmath33 observational constraints from the literature .",
    "table1 summarizes the observational constraints and the properties of two models marked along the evolution tracks that lie at the top and bottom of the luminosity bounds , which we chose to analyse for pulsations .",
    "the radius of the 1.38-m@xmath10 model at the top of the box is a little too high , and the radius of the 1.29-m@xmath10 model at the bottom of the box is a little too low , but we chose these models to bracket the extremes in convection zone depth , which is an important property for @xmath5dor pulsation driving ( see discussion below ) , given the luminosity constraint .",
    "the 1.38-m@xmath10 higher - metallicity model has a deeper convective envelope , with temperature at the base of the envelope convection zone near 500000k , whereas the 1.29-m@xmath10 model with lower metallicity has a convective envelope base temperature of @xmath9450000k . for @xmath5dor stars , the convective envelope base temperature that optimizes the growth rates and number of unstable g modes",
    "is predicted to be about 300000k ( see guzik et al.2000 and warner et al.2003 ) .",
    "therefore , the majority of @xmath5dor g - mode pulsators are expected to have somewhat larger mass ( @xmath91.6m@xmath10 ) for solar metallicity and therefore shallower convective envelopes than @xmath1cyg . for models with convective envelopes that are too deep ,",
    "the radiative damping below the convective envelope quenches the pulsation driving ; for models with convective envelopes that are too shallow , the convective time scale becomes shorter than the g - mode pulsation periods , and convection can adapt during the pulsation cycle to transport radiation , making the convective blocking mechanism ineffective for driving the pulsations .",
    "we analysed the models for pulsations using the pesnell ( 1990 ) non - adiabatic pulsation code , which also was used by guzik et al.(2000 ) and warner et al.(2003 ) to explain the pulsation driving mechanism for @xmath5dor pulsations and to predict the instability strip location .",
    "the results are summarized in table  2 . for the 1.38-m@xmath10 model with the deeper convective envelope ,",
    "only one @xmath34 high - order g mode is predicted to be pulsationally unstable . for the 1.29-m@xmath10 model with a shallower convective envelope , several @xmath34 and @xmath35 modes with periods in the range @xmath36d",
    "are predicted to be unstable .",
    "therefore , if lower metallicities , appropriate for the asplund et al .",
    "( 2005 ) solar abundances , are adopted , @xmath1cyg has potential to show @xmath5dor g - mode pulsations , as well as the already - observed solar - like oscillations .",
    "this star would then become the first known hybrid @xmath5dor / solar - like oscillator .",
    "longer time series observations will be required to improve the signal - to - noise ratio and separate the g modes from the granulation signal at low frequency to detect the potential g modes . on the other hand , if this star does not show g modes , such observations would support the higher metallicity more appropriate for the older solar abundances , also favored by helioseismology ( see , e.g. , basu & antia 2008 ; guzik & mussack 2010 ) , and/or help to constrain the location of the red edge of the @xmath5dor instability strip .",
    "therefore , continued observations of @xmath1cyg could shed light both on @xmath5dor g - mode instability , and on the solar abundance problem .    llll & g - mode properties & 1.38-m@xmath10 model 1 & 1.29-m@xmath10 model 2 +   + @xmath37=1 & period spacings ( d ) & @xmath9 0.040 & @xmath9 0.038 + & radial orders @xmath38 & 22 & 18 to 25 + & growth rates / period@xmath39 & 4.5e-09 & @xmath401.0e-07 + & periods ( d ) & 0.77 & 0.58 to 0.95 +   + @xmath37=2 & period spacings ( d ) & @xmath9 0.027 & @xmath9 0.025 + & radial orders @xmath38 & no unstable modes & 20 to 28 + & growth rates / period@xmath39 & & @xmath401.0e-7 + & periods ( d ) & & 0.37 to 0.55 +      solar - like oscillations with high radial order exhibit characteristic large frequency separations , @xmath41 , between @xmath34 and @xmath42 modes of the same radial order , and small separations , @xmath43 , between @xmath35 and @xmath42 and between @xmath44 and @xmath45 modes of consecutive radial order ( e.g. , aerts et al . 2010 ) .",
    "an autocorrelation analysis of the frequency separations in the @xmath1cyg solar - like oscillations shows a peak at multiples of 42@xmath4hz , interpreted to be half the large separation , @xmath46 ( fig.5 ) . by comparison ,",
    "half of the large frequency separation for the sun is 67.5@xmath4hz .",
    "fig.6 shows a histogram of the number of frequency spacings per one-@xmath4hz bin for all of the calculated p - mode frequencies between 1200 and 2500@xmath4hz for our 1.38- and 1.29-m@xmath10 models . the 1.38-m@xmath10 model has a mean @xmath47@xmath4hz , while the 1.29-m@xmath10 model has mean @xmath48@xmath4hz ; the results for the two models bracket the observed large separation .",
    "follow - up _ kepler _ photometry of @xmath1cyg , as well as optical interferometry and spectroscopic abundance analyses , will be worthwhile .",
    "the first data show solar - like p modes but no evidence ( yet ) of @xmath5dor gravity modes .",
    "our stellar models show that @xmath1cyg is likely on , or very near , the red edge of the @xmath5dor instability strip .",
    "an interferometric angular diameter combined with the hipparcos parallax can narrow the constraints for @xmath1cyg to better accuracy than spectroscopic / photometric analyses alone .",
    "improved constraints are essential for g - mode predictions , since a lower radius from interferometry would drive model solutions to lower metallicity for a given luminosity , so that the convective envelope may be shallow enough to allow some unstable g - mode pulsations . resolving and tracking the 0.35m@xmath10 m - dwarf companion for most of its very long orbital period , or finding one or more planets in closer orbits around @xmath1cyg would help further to constrain its mass . @xmath1cyg",
