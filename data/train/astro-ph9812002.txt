    "within a decade of defining his classification system for galaxies , hubble ( 1936 ) observed that elliptical and spiral galaxies tend to reside in different environments , with elliptical galaxies preferentially represented in rich clusters and spiral galaxies more numerous in the field .",
    "more recent studies have confirmed and detailed this dependence of clustering on morphological type , and they have shown that luminous galaxies cluster more strongly than faint galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and that optically selected galaxies cluster more strongly than infrared selected galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . at most one of these galaxy populations can trace the underlying distribution of mass , and it is more likely that none of them does .",
    "the idea of biased galaxy formation  preferential formation of galaxies in high density environments  was originally introduced with the hope of reconciling the low apparent mass - to - light ratios of bound galaxy structures with the theoretically motivated assumption of an @xmath2 universe ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , it is now broadly recognized that bias , or anti - bias , is a possibility that we are stuck with , whatever the value of @xmath3 .",
    "cosmological n - body simulations can predict statistical properties of the mass distribution in a specified cosmological model , but they can not predict the clustering of galaxies without an additional prescription for the relation between galaxies and mass . in this paper , we apply a variety of simple bias prescriptions to n - body simulations in order to see how assumptions about bias influence measurable properties of large scale structure , such as the correlation function , the power spectrum , moments of galaxy counts , pairwise velocities , and the relation between galaxy density and peculiar velocity fields .    while the full theory of galaxy formation is likely to be complicated , a plausible and still very general assumption is that the efficiency of galaxy formation is determined by properties of the local environment . for practical purposes , `` local '' means a scale comparable to the galaxy correlation length , the distance over which material in non - linear structures has mixed during the history of the universe . in a local theory of galaxy formation , when a collapsing region of the mass distribution decides whether to become a galaxy ( or what type of galaxy to become , or how many galaxies to become ) , it has no direct knowledge of material that it has never encountered . on the other hand , `` non - local '' biasing , in which the efficiency of galaxy formation varies coherently over larger scales",
    ", requires a more exotic physical mechanism , such as suppression or stimulation of galaxy formation by ionizing radiation or by some other influence that can propagate at the speed of light . in this paper",
    ", we examine several examples of local biasing , with the efficiency of galaxy formation determined by the density , pressure , or geometry of the mass distribution in a surrounding @xmath4 sphere ( where @xmath5 ) .",
    "we compare the effects of these local bias models to those of non - local models inspired by the proposals of babul & white ( 1991 ) and bower et al .",
    "( 1993 ) .    for purposes of our study ,",
    "it is important to maintain the distinction between a model of biased galaxy formation , which is a fully specified prescription for populating a mass distribution with galaxies , and a description of the _ effects _ of bias . the widely used `` linear bias model ''  @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the mass density contrast",
    ", @xmath8 is the galaxy density contrast , and @xmath9 is the bias factor  is more properly regarded as a description rather than a model .",
    "one can not use the @xmath10 formula to assign galaxies to the mass distribution on any scale where the minimum density contrast is @xmath11 , since it would demand an unphysically negative galaxy density . however , linear bias could emerge as a reasonable approximation to the effects of a physical bias model on large scales , at least for some purposes .",
    "the relation between the galaxy and mass correlation functions is often written @xmath12 , which is again a description rather than a model . while it might seem reasonable to let @xmath13 be an arbitrary function of scale , a series of analytic arguments of increasing generality suggest that for any local bias the quantity @xmath13 must asymptote to a constant value in the limit @xmath14 , making it impossible for local bias to resolve a discrepancy between the predicted and observed shapes of @xmath15 on large scales ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "even the most general of these arguments relies on assumptions about the mass clustering and the bias model , and it yields only an asymptotic result . the numerical approach here complements the analytic studies by exhibiting fully non - linear solutions for a diverse set of biasing models , including some that do not satisfy the formal assumptions of the analytic calculations .    in principle , the relation between galaxies and mass should be a prediction of a cosmological theory , not an input to it .",
    "there has been substantial progress towards making such _ a priori _ predictions in recent years using hydrodynamic simulations ( @xcite , 1993 , 1998 ; @xcite , 1996 , 1998 ; @xcite ) , n - body simulations that attempt to resolve galaxy mass halos within larger virialized systems ( @xcite ) , or a combination of lower resolution n - body simulations with semi - analytic models of galaxy formation ( kauffmann et al .",
    "1997 , 1998 ; @xcite ) . however , the semi - analytic models require a series of approximations and assumptions , and the numerical studies suffer from limited resolution and simulation volumes and also rely on simplified descriptions of star formation and supernova feedback . at present these approaches yield physically motivated models of biased galaxy formation that can be tested against observations , but they do not provide definitive predictions .    in this paper we take a different and in some ways less ambitious tack .",
    "we combine large volume , relatively low resolution n - body simulations with simple bias prescriptions that are deliberately designed to `` parametrize ignorance '' about galaxy formation , by illustrating a wide range of possibilities .",
    "we extend weinberg s ( 1995 ) study along similar lines by using better simulations and examining a much wider range of galaxy clustering measures .",
    "our study also overlaps that of mann , peacock , & heavens ( 1998 , hereafter mph98 ) , who applied several different biasing prescriptions to large n - body simulations and investigated their influence on the galaxy power spectrum and on cluster mass - to - light ratios .",
    "our goal here is to see which measurable properties of galaxy clustering are sensitive to assumptions about bias and which properties are robust , or at least are affected in a simple way by local bias .",
    "our numerical study complements the general analytic treatment of non - linear , stochastic biasing models by dekel & lahav ( 1998 , hereafter dl98 ) .",
    "the biasing prescriptions that we adopt in this paper are all eulerian models , meaning that the efficiency of galaxy formation is determined by properties of the evolved mass density field .",
    "these can be contrasted with lagrangian bias models , such as the high peaks model ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , in which the efficiency of galaxy formation depends on the initial ( linear ) density field . because galaxies can merge as structure evolves ,",
    "neither a pure lagrangian nor a pure eulerian description of bias is entirely realistic .",
    "however , for studies of galaxy clustering at a specified redshift , either approach may provide a reasonable approximate description , and the distinction between them is more technical than physical . the distinction between local and non - local models , on the other hand , is fundamentally tied to the physical mechanisms that cause bias .",
    "eulerian , lagrangian , and intermediate approaches would yield different predictions for the evolution of bias with redshift , but we do not examine this issue in this paper . the evolution of bias has been studied using the numerical and semi - analytic approaches mentioned above and in a more general analytic framework by fry ( 1996 ) and tegmark & peebles ( 1998 ) .",
    "we begin our investigation in  2 with a simple but informative example , in which the galaxy population as a whole traces the mass but the mix of morphological types is determined by a local morphology - density relation .",
    "this example illustrates some general properties of local bias models , and our calculations provide generic predictions , testable with the next generation of redshift surveys , for the dependence of the large scale correlation function and power spectrum on morphological type .",
    "we then move to models in which the galaxy population has an overall bias , which is applied using a variety of local and non - local prescriptions .",
    "we describe the models and examine their influence on a number of different measures of large scale structure in  3 .",
    "section 4 provides a fairly complete summary of our results and discusses their implications in light of other recent studies and anticipated observational developments .",
    "the longest recognized and most clearly established form of `` bias '' in the galaxy distribution is the marked preference of early - type galaxies for dense environments ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "there have been numerous efforts to quantify this connection between morphology and environment ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and several groups have used angular correlation functions , redshift - space correlation functions , or de - projected real - space correlation functions to characterize the dependence of clustering on morphology ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the stronger clustering of early - type galaxies explains the stronger clustering found in optically selected galaxy catalogs relative to iras - selected catalogs , which preferentially include dusty , late - type galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "postman & geller ( 1984 , hereafter pg84 ) parametrize the morphology - environment connection as a relation between morphological fractions and local galaxy density : for overdensities @xmath16 the fractions of ellipticals , s0s , and spirals are independent of environment , but at higher densities the elliptical and s0 fractions climb steadily , eventually saturating for @xmath17 . in this section ,",
    "we consider a model in which the galaxy population as a whole traces the underlying mass distribution but morphological types are assigned according to pg84 s prescription .",
    "our results will show what should be expected from large redshift surveys like the 2 degree field ( 2df ) survey ( @xcite ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) if a local morphology - density relation is a correct description of the influence of environment on morphological type .",
    "this investigation also provides a `` warmup '' for the investigations in  3 , since the morphology - density relation is a simple example of a local bias mechanism .    for our underlying mass distribution ,",
    "we use the output of an n - body simulation of an open cold dark matter ( cdm ) model performed by cole et al .",

    "however , for the purposes of our investigation it is more important to have good statistics on very large scales than to have high gravitational force resolution .",

    "we also evolved this mass distribution using twice this number of time steps and found that the correlation function and the velocity dispersion of the resulting mass distributions changed very little , showing that our results are robust to increasing the temporal resolution of the n - body simulation .",
    "we ran four such simulations with different random phases for the fourier components of the initial density field , and the results we show are averaged over these four independent mass / galaxy distributions .",
    "we now describe our local eulerian biasing models in detail .",
    "the first two schemes , density - threshold bias and power - law bias , select galaxies based on the local mass density alone .",
    "the sheet bias scheme selects galaxies based on the geometry of the local mass distribution .",

    ", they should preferentially populate regions of higher mass density .",
    "the simplest prescription that achieves this is a density - threshold bias : galaxy formation is entirely suppressed below some threshold , and galaxies form with equal efficiency per unit mass in all regions above the threshold .",
    "this biasing scheme was adopted in some of the early numerical investigations of cdm models ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and it has been used extensively by j.  einasto and collaborators in theoretical modeling of voids and superclusters ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the density - threshold bias model ,",

    "this biasing relation is similar to the one suggested by cen & ostriker ( 1993 ) based on hydrodynamic simulations incorporating physical models for galaxy formation ( @xcite ) , but it differs in that there is no quadratic term that saturates the biasing relation at high mass densities .",
    "little & weinberg ( 1994 ) have compared the influence of density - threshold bias and cen - ostriker bias on the void probability function , showing that the size of empty voids is substantially larger for threshold bias at fixed @xmath98 .",

    "these considerations , and the desire to investigate a radical alternative to density - based models , motivate us to consider a biasing scheme in which the efficiency of galaxy formation depends solely on the geometry of the local mass distribution .    in order to identify sheet - like regions of the mass distribution ,",
    "we compute the three eigenvalues @xmath99 of the moment of inertia tensor in the @xmath4 sphere surrounding each n - body particle . the selection probability for a particle to be a galaxy is p = [ eqn : sheetbias ] this procedure selects galaxies in regions where the mass distribution is planar , @xmath100 , and avoids regions where the mass distribution is isotropic , @xmath101 .",

    "we eliminate all particles that have fewer than 18 neighbors within @xmath4 ( @xmath104 ) because the moment - of - inertia tensor would be too noisy .",
    "we also investigated two other local biasing schemes considered by weinberg ( 1995 ) .",
    "the first of these , pressure bias , is similar to density - threshold bias , except that the galaxies are selected based on a threshold in @xmath105 rather than @xmath96 , where @xmath106 is the velocity dispersion in a @xmath4 sphere .",
    "this scheme is motivated by the possibility that the pressure of the local intergalactic medium could play a role in stimulating galaxy formation . however , the velocity dispersion @xmath106 is itself fairly well correlated with @xmath96 , and we decided to omit results for the pressure bias model from our figures below because they are nearly identical to those of the density - threshold bias model ( as also found by weinberg 1995 ) .",
    "this similarity of results seems somewhat at odds with blanton et al.s ( 1998 ) finding that the inclusion of gas temperature or dark matter velocity dispersion as a variable in the bias relation increases the scale - dependence of the bias factor .",
    "we return to this issue in  4 .",
    "the second additional scheme , filament bias , is similar to sheet bias ( eq .",
    "[ [ eqn : sheetbias ] ] ) , except that the selection is based on the eigenvalue ratio @xmath107 instead of @xmath102 .",
    "our quantitative results for filament bias are somewhat different from those of sheet bias , but they are similar enough that we decided not to include them as separate curves or panels in our figures . in the case of an identical threshold flatness ratio @xmath92 ,",
    "the particles selected by filament bias are a subset of those selected by sheet bias .",
    "however , a given value of @xmath92 produces different values of @xmath98 for sheet and filament bias .",

    "bw91 showed that the scdm power spectrum could be reconciled with the apm measurements if the formation of luminous galaxies was suppressed in randomly placed spheres with a filling factor @xmath109 and radii @xmath110 , perhaps because of photoionization by quasars ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "the influence of large scale density contrast in the non - local model does not significantly increase the scatter in @xmath218 vs. @xmath183 over that in the power - law model . in the sheet bias model ,",
    "on the other hand , galaxy selection is based on the geometry of the local mass distribution rather than the mass density .",
    "these quantities are correlated , but the scatter between @xmath228 and @xmath229 is much larger than in the density - based models , though it still becomes fairly small for @xmath230 . in the void bias model , the probability that a mass particle is included as",
    "a galaxy is entirely independent of the local mass density , since the voids are thrown at random into the mass distribution .",
    "the void bias model therefore has large scatter between @xmath218 and @xmath183 , persisting to very large scales . at small @xmath226 , the 10th percentile",
    "at all @xmath183 corresponds to regions that are empty of galaxies , while the 90th percentile corresponds to regions in which the smoothing volume does not overlap any of the voids .",
    "=    in practice , the mass density contrast @xmath183 used as the independent variable in figure  [ fig : rhorho ] is not directly observable .",
    "however , @xmath183 can be inferred from the divergence of the peculiar velocity field using the linear perturbation theory relation @xmath231 or weakly non - linear relations ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath232 can be inferred from observations of the radial peculiar velocity field by the potent method , under the assumption that the peculiar velocity field remains irrotational during gravitational evolution ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in the case of linear bias , the slope of the relation between @xmath218 and @xmath233 provides an estimate of the quantity @xmath234 .",
    "figure  [ fig : rhodivv ] shows the relation between @xmath218 and @xmath235 for the unbiased mass distribution ( top row ) and the various biased galaxy distributions , in the same format as figure  [ fig : rhorho ] .",
    "the three columns from left to right show the relation when the fields are smoothed with gaussian filters of radius @xmath236 10 , and @xmath222 , respectively .",
    "we use the method of babul et al .",
    "( 1994 ) to create a volume - weighted , smoothed velocity field from the discrete galaxy peculiar velocities .",
    "specifically , we first form the momentum field by cic - binning the momentum of every galaxy onto a @xmath83 grid .",
    "we smooth this momentum field with a gaussian filter of radius @xmath237 and divide it by a similarly smoothed density field to form a mass - weighted smoothed velocity field .",
    "we then smooth this velocity field with another gaussian filter of radius @xmath238 , so that the effective smoothing radius is @xmath226 . because the second smoothing dominates over the first ,",
    "the final velocity field is volume - weighted rather than mass - weighted .",
    "we do not show the @xmath239 vs. @xmath240 relation at @xmath241 because the discrete galaxy distribution yields an excessively noisy velocity field in low density regions for this smoothing length .    in the first row of figure 17 ,",
    "systematic departures of the solid curves from the linear theory relation @xmath242 are caused by non - linear gravitational evolution .",
    "this deviation decreases drastically with increased smoothing , showing that linear theory is an increasingly better approximation of the gravitational evolution on larger scales .",
    "the panels in the remaining rows of figure 17 show the distribution of the galaxy density fluctuations @xmath243 plotted against @xmath244 . for @xmath225",
    "these plots look similar to the corresponding panels of figure  [ fig : rhorho ] . for smaller smoothing lengths",
    "the relation between @xmath218 and @xmath245 is more non - linear than the relation between @xmath218 and @xmath183 because of the additional non - linearity of the @xmath246 relation .",
    "comparisons between galaxy density fields and mass density fields estimated from potent usually account for the non - linear relation between @xmath183 and @xmath245 , but the non - linearity and scatter of the bias relation itself are potential sources of additional systematic error in potent estimates of @xmath247 , as noted by dl98 .",
    "the importance of these effects depends in detail on the form of bias  e.g. , density - threshold bias produces a nearly linear relation with small scatter , power - law bias produces a non - linear relation with small scatter , and sheet bias produces a nearly linear relation with large scatter .",
    "we have examined the influence of the morphology - density relation and biased galaxy formation on many of the statistical measures that are commonly used to characterize galaxy clustering and galaxy peculiar velocity fields .",
    "we have focused most of our attention on local biasing models , in which the efficiency of galaxy formation is governed by the density ( density - threshold or power - law bias ) , geometry ( sheet or filament bias ) , or `` pressure '' ( @xmath248 ) within a sphere of radius @xmath4 .",
    "we have contrasted the behavior of these local models with that of models in which the galaxy density is coherently modulated over large scales ( non - local bias , as proposed by bcfw93 ) or suppressed in randomly distributed voids ( void bias , as proposed by bw91 ) . in this section ,",
    "we summarize our results , then discuss them in light of other recent work and anticipated observational developments .",
    "if the morphological segregation of galaxies is governed by the local morphology - density relation proposed by postman & geller ( 1984 ) , then on small scales the correlation function of early - type galaxies should be both steeper and stronger than that of late - type galaxies , in accord with present observations . on scales larger than the galaxy correlation length , early - type galaxies should remain more strongly clustered than late - type galaxies , but the correlation functions ( and power spectra ) should have the same shape .",
    "this prediction of the local morphology - density model is consistent with current data and can be tested at high precision by the 2df and sdss redshift surveys .    in all of the examples that we have investigated",
    ", local bias produces a scale - independent amplification of the two - point correlation function and power spectrum on scales in the linear regime . on these scales , therefore , local biasing can not resolve a discrepancy between the shape of the mass power spectrum predicted by a cosmological model and the shape of the observed galaxy power spectrum .",
    "non - local biasing can resolve such a discrepancy , as originally shown by bw91 and bcfw93 in the context of `` standard '' cdm and the apm galaxy survey , but achieving this alteration of the power spectrum shape requires a bias mechanism that directly modulates galaxy formation in a coherent way over large scales . in the non - linear regime , by contrast , the bias functions @xmath63 , @xmath249 , and @xmath142 are scale - dependent even in local models , and their shapes depend on the details of the biasing scheme .    local bias models roughly preserve the hierarchical relations between moments of the galaxy count distribution , in that the ratios @xmath250 and @xmath251 are only weakly dependent on smoothing scale ( and hence on @xmath252 ) .",
    "however , local bias can change both the amplitude and shape of the functions @xmath166 and @xmath168 .",
    "our power - law bias model gives @xmath166 and @xmath168 close to those of the underlying mass distribution , and our non - local bias model in turn gives @xmath166 and @xmath168 close to those of the local power - law model .",
    "these results show that agreement between measured hierarchical amplitudes and perturbation theory predictions for the mass distribution does not necessarily imply that galaxy formation is unbiased or even that it is locally biased , although such agreement can rule out specific local and non - local models ( @xcite ) .    if we characterize the effect of bias on the variance and skewness of galaxy counts by linear and quadratic bias parameters @xmath181 and @xmath184 , then @xmath181 is independent of scale on large scales in all of our local models .",
    "our results are marginally but not strongly inconsistent with the conjecture that @xmath184 becomes scale - independent on large scales in local bias models .",
    "the scale - dependence of @xmath253 and @xmath254 is much stronger in our non - local model than in any of our local models . on large scales ,",
    "void bias produces a scale - independent @xmath253 but a scale - dependent @xmath254 .",
    "estimates of moments of the velocity distribution from galaxy redshift surveys , which are weighted by galaxy pairs , are strongly affected by biasing because of correlations between the velocity distribution and the parameters that determine the galaxy formation efficiency .",
    "in particular , the pairwise velocity dispersion @xmath255 is sensitive to the details of the bias model at all separations .",
    "the two bias models with the steepest small scale correlation function , power - law bias and sheet bias , have values of @xmath214 that differ by a factor of two at @xmath256 , because the first enhances galaxy formation in dense , isotropic clusters while the second does not .",
    "the dependence of the mean pairwise velocity @xmath206 on bias is similarly complex on small scales , but the behavior simplifies for local bias models at large @xmath56 , where the galaxy @xmath257 is amplified over the mass @xmath257 by a factor @xmath258 that is close to the correlation function bias @xmath182 .",
    "these biases of pairwise moments arise even though the galaxies in our models are just a subset of the dark matter particles and therefore have the same local velocity distribution .",
    "void bias presents an odd case in which the galaxy distribution is biased but @xmath255 and @xmath206 are not .",
    "the relation between local velocity dispersion and local overdensity ( kepner et al .  1997 ; strauss et al .",
    "1998 ) is also sensitive to bias , complicating the use of this statistic as a diagnostic for @xmath199 .",
    "the median trend and scatter of the relation between @xmath218 and @xmath183 or @xmath218 and @xmath245 depends on the biasing scheme and on the smoothing scale used to define the density and velocity fields .",
    "the density - threshold bias prescription produces a relation that is remarkably close to linear bias , @xmath204 .",
    "power - law bias produces a curved @xmath246 relation , and , as noted by dl98 , the non - linearity of this relation is a possible source of systematic error in efforts to measure @xmath259 via the potent method ( @xcite ; @xcite ) or via redshift space distortions ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the relation between @xmath218 and @xmath183 is fairly tight for the bias schemes that are based on local density , but it exhibits much more scatter for the sheet bias scheme , as one might expect .",
    "the void bias model predicts very large scatter between @xmath218 and @xmath183 or @xmath245 , even for smoothing lengths as large as @xmath260 .",
    "the observed correlation between @xmath218 and @xmath245 ( @xcite ) is probably sufficient to rule out such a model , as first argued by babul et al .",
    "however , our less extreme non - local bias model predicts a relation that is nearly as tight as that of the local power - law bias model , so the existence of a tight relation between @xmath218 and @xmath245 is not sufficient to rule out non - locally biased galaxy formation .    our results for the large scale behavior of @xmath15 and @xmath28 strengthen the conclusions of earlier analytic arguments ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and numerical investigations ( @xcite ; mph98 ; @xcite ) .",
    "although we can only examine a finite number of specific biasing prescriptions , these examples show that scale - independent amplification of @xmath15 and @xmath28 occurs even in models like sheet , filament , and pressure bias , where the galaxy formation efficiency is not governed strictly by the local mass density .",
    "we also find that the asymptotic regime of nearly constant @xmath182 , @xmath98 , and @xmath261 is effectively reached on mildly non - linear scales , soon after @xmath15 drops below one .",
    "our conclusions may seem mildly at odds with those of blanton et al.(1998 , hereafter bcos98 ) , who find scale - dependent bias of the `` galaxy '' population in a hydrodynamic simulation of the @xmath262cdm model ( by @xcite ) the difference is largely a matter of emphasis : bcos98 find substantial scale - dependence of @xmath249 in the non - linear regime , but they find only a 12% drop in @xmath249 from @xmath263 to @xmath264 , which is the same drop we find for our sheet bias model",
    ". our power - law and sheet bias models also show significant scale - dependence of @xmath249 in the non - linear regime ( @xmath265 ) , though not as strong as that found by bcos98 .",
    "bcos98 demonstrate that the scale - dependence of bias in their simulation arises mainly from the correlation between galaxy formation efficiency and the local gas temperature @xmath266 or dark matter velocity dispersion @xmath106 .",
    "they further argue that this correlation leads to scale - dependence because of the connection between @xmath266 ( or @xmath106 ) and the gravitational potential , which has a much redder power spectrum than the density field itself . in the terminology of this paper",
    ", the bcos98 argument could be rephrased as a claim that temperature is a local variable whose influence is more `` effectively non - local '' than that of other local variables .",
    "the fact that we obtain virtually identical results for density - threshold and pressure bias implies that enhanced scale - dependence is not an _",
    "automatic _ consequence of incorporating temperature or @xmath106 into the biasing prescription . in order to address this issue more directly",
    ", we also examined a model in which we biased the galaxy distribution using a threshold in @xmath106 alone , a pure `` temperature '' bias .",
    "we again obtained results nearly identical to those of the density - threshold model , with no enhanced scale - dependence of the bias .",
    "the difference of our result from that of bcos98 s similar numerical experiment presumably reflects our use of a @xmath4 rather than a @xmath267 sphere to define @xmath106 .",
    "averaged over this larger scale , velocity dispersion does not behave any more `` non - locally '' than density .",
    "this result does not mean that galaxy bias in a realistic model might not be as scale - dependent as bcos98 find , only that the influence of temperature or velocity dispersion on the scale - dependence of bias depends in detail on the scale over which it is defined and the way that it is incorporated into the bias prescription .",
    "our numerical study complements the general analytic examination of stochastic , non - linear biasing by dl98 .",
    "the use of n - body simulations allows us to investigate the effects of a wide range of biasing prescriptions on measures of galaxy clustering in the linear , mildly non - linear , and strongly non - linear regimes . for the most part",
    ", we have addressed different issues from dl98 , but we concur on the general point that bias is a multi - faceted phenomenon , and that only in specific cases and limits can it be described by a single parameter . on small scales ,",
    "the relation between @xmath218 and @xmath183 is generically non - linear and scale - dependent , and it may have substantial scatter . at any given scale",
    "one can define many different `` bias factors ''  @xmath182 , @xmath98 , @xmath261 , @xmath181 , @xmath184 , @xmath258 , etc .  and the relation among them depends on the details of the biasing scheme , or , ultimately , on the physics of galaxy formation .    despite this complexity ,",
    "our results show that the very general assumption of local biasing leads to some important simplifications on large scales .",
    "most significantly , the scale - independence of @xmath182 and @xmath261 in the linear regime means that large galaxy redshift surveys like 2df and the sdss should reveal the true shape of the dark matter power spectrum on large scales , if galaxy formation is governed by local physics .",
    "indeed , this result makes the local biasing hypothesis testable , since any non - local physics that significantly modulated galaxy formation would almost certainly have a different impact on galaxies of widely differing luminosity , stellar population age , morphology , and surface mass density .",
    "existing data clearly show that different types of galaxies have different clustering amplitudes , but if each galaxy s properties are determined by the history of its local environment then the 2df and sdss redshift surveys should show that all galaxies have the same @xmath28 shape on large scales .",
    "the uncertainties of bias have been a source of frustration in efforts to test cosmological models against observations of galaxy clustering . in recent years",
    ", observational and theoretical breakthroughs have opened a number of alternative routes to measuring cosmological parameters and the mass power spectrum , including microwave background anisotropies , the ly@xmath268 forest , the supernova hubble diagram , weak gravitational lensing , and the mass function and evolution of the galaxy cluster population .",
    "these approaches are insensitive or weakly sensitive to biased galaxy formation , though each one has its own set of assumptions and limitations .",
    "recent years have also seen great improvements in the predictive power of theories of galaxy formation , thanks to advances in numerical simulations and semi - analytic modeling techniques that combine gravitational clustering with the more complicated physical processes of gas cooling , star formation , supernova feedback , metal enrichment , and morphological transformation via mergers and interactions .",
    "while the sensitivity of galaxy clustering statistics to the details of galaxy biasing is an obstacle to testing cosmological models , it becomes an asset when the goal is testing the theory of galaxy formation itself , especially if the underlying cosmological model is tightly constrained by independent observations .",
    "we have already argued that @xmath28 and @xmath15 can test the broad hypothesis of local galaxy formation , and at a greater level of detail we might , for example , come to view the pairwise velocity dispersion not as a tool for measuring @xmath199 but as a diagnostic for the importance of mergers in dense environments .",
    "the giant redshift surveys currently underway will provide superb data sets for such studies , allowing precise clustering measurements for finely divided subsets of the galaxy population over a wide range of scales .",
    "other kinds of data may play an equal or more important role in determining the material contents of the universe and the origin of cosmic inhomogeneity , but measurements of large scale structure at high and low redshift will guide our understanding of the physics that transformed primordial dark matter fluctuations into the universe of galaxies .",

    "<S> if morphological segregation of galaxies is governed by a local morphology - density relation , then the correlation function of e / s0 galaxies should be steeper and stronger than that of spiral galaxies on small scales , as observed , while on large scales the e / s0 and spiral galaxies should have correlation functions with the same shape but different amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , all of our local bias models produce scale - independent amplification of the correlation function and power spectrum in the linear and mildly non - linear regimes ; only a non - local biasing mechanism can alter the shape of the power spectrum on large scales . </S>",
    "<S> moments of the biased galaxy distribution retain the hierarchical pattern of the mass moments , but biasing alters the values and scale - dependence of the hierarchical amplitudes @xmath0 and @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> pair - weighted moments of the galaxy velocity distribution are sensitive to the details of the bias prescription even if galaxies have the same local velocity distribution as the underlying dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> the non - linearity of the relation between galaxy density and mass density depends on the biasing prescription and the smoothing scale , and the scatter in this relation is a useful diagnostic of the physical parameters that determine the bias . </S>",
    "<S> while the assumption that galaxy formation is governed by local physics leads to some important simplifications on large scales , even local biasing is a multi - faceted phenomenon whose impact can not be described by a single parameter or function . </S>",
    "<S> the sensitivity of galaxy clustering statistics to the details of galaxy biasing is an obstacle to testing cosmological models , but it is an equally significant asset for testing physical theories of galaxy formation against data from redshift and peculiar velocity surveys </S>",
