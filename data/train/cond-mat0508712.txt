    "experiments on a variety of novel materials , ranging from quasi - one - dimensional ( 1d ) mx solids @xcite , organics @xcite and quasi-2d high-@xmath0 cuprates @xcite to 3d colossal - magnetoresistive manganites  @xcite , provide clear evidence for the existence of polaronic carriers , i.e. , quasiparticles consisting of an electron and a surrounding lattice distortion .",
    "this has motivated considerable theoretical efforts to achieve a better understanding of strongly coupled electron - phonon systems in the framework of microscopic models .",
    "unfortunately , even for highly simplified models , such as the spinless holstein model @xcite considered here , no exact analytical solutions exist , except for the holstein polaron problem with a relativistic dispersion @xcite or in infinite dimensions @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "numerous numerical studies have been carried out , focussing either on the empty band limit ( i.e. , one or two electrons only ; see @xcite and references therein ) , or on the half - filled band case in one dimension , where the peierls transition takes place @xcite .",
    "in contrast , very little work has been done at finite carrier densities away from half filling @xcite , which are , however , often realized in experiment @xcite .",
    "recently , this so - called _ many - polaron problem _ has been addressed numerically @xcite .",
    "the results have led to a fairly good understanding of many aspects , but their interpretation is not always straight forward , which makes analytical calculations along these lines highly desirable .    in this paper , we propose an analytical approach to the 1d spinless holstein model , capable of describing finite charge - carrier concentrations at arbitrary model parameters , including the important adiabatic intermediate - coupling ( ic ) regime .    first ,",
    "using standard perturbation theory based on the self - energy calculation , the spectral functions of charge carriers will be determined in the weak - coupling ( wc ) and the strong - coupling ( sc ) limits at zero temperature ( @xmath1 ) . in the sc regime ,",
    "the relation between the spectral function of polarons , determining the equilibrium properties ( in particular , the chemical potential ) , and the electronic spectral function , determining the photoemission spectrum , will be discussed .",
    "special emphasis will be laid on the distinction between the coherent and the incoherent parts of the spectra , which may be calculated separately within the present approach .",
    "furthermore , using a generalization of the lang - firsov canonical transformation method  @xcite , an interpolation scheme between the extreme wc and sc cases will be proposed . in particular ,",
    "the canonical transformation will depend on the distance @xmath2 characterizing the charge distribution across the polaron volume .",
    "for a given set of model parameters and carrier concentration @xmath3 , @xmath2 will be determined from the minimum of the total energy given by the transformed hamiltonian in the first , hartree - like approximation . with @xmath2 found in this way , the polaronic and electronic spectral functions will be calculated to study their dependence on the model parameters and the carrier density .",
    "the results will be discussed with regard to recent numerical calculations @xcite , which have revealed a cross - over from a system with polaronic carriers to a rather metallic system with increasing band filling @xmath3 in the intermediate electron - phonon coupling regime .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : model ]",
    "we introduce the model used , whereas in section  [ sec : gfapproach ] we derive the analytical results for wc , sc and ic regimes .",
    "our results are discussed in section  [ sec : results ] , and section  [ sec : conclusion ] contains our conclusions .",
    "in this paper , we are exclusively concerned with the holstein model ( hm ) of spinless fermions , which describes electrons coupled locally to einstein phonons .",
    "although we shall use different canonical transformations to describe the ic and sc regime later on , the hamiltonian can be written in the general form @xmath4 where the definition of @xmath5 and @xmath6 will be different depending on the approach used . here",

    "the green function equation of motion deduced from @xmath26 may be converted into an equation for the self - energy of the spinless fermions , and can be solved by iteration ( see @xcite for details ) . in the second iteration step ,",

    "note that opposite to the wc case , where the sum rule for the spectral function becomes more and more violated with increasing coupling ( figure  [ fig : weight_wc ] ) , here the sc approximation becomes increasingly better with increasing @xmath18 ( figure  [ fig : weight_sc ] ) .",
    "we would like to point out that such changes in the total spectral weight are absent in the work of alexandrov and ranninger  @xcite , since the latter was restricted to the lowest ( first ) order of the self - energy , similar to the hartree approximation discussed in section  [ sec : interm - coupl ] .",
    "in general , the total spectral weight contained in the ( electronic or polaronic ) spectral function for given parameters depends on the approximations made . as illustrated by figures  [ fig : weight_wc ] and  [ fig : weight_sc ] , the total spectral weight approaches the exact value of unity in the wc and sc regimes , respectively , so that the normalization of the spectrum serves as a measure of the validity of the underlying approximations . since in the present case even the first moment ( i.e. , the normalization ) shows deviations from exact results , we have refrained from checking the more complicated sum rules derived in @xcite .",
    "this is also true of the ic case discussed below .",
    "the effect of increasing the phonon frequency @xmath12 can be seen by comparing figures  [ fig : polaron_spectrum_sc](a ) and ( b ) . most noticeably , for larger @xmath12 , the width of the coherent polaron band  roughly scaling proportional to @xmath170is larger .",
    "the polaronic spectrum is related to the electronic spectrum @xmath171 by equation  ( [ eq : sc_el_spectrum ] ) , and typical results in the adiabatic and non - adiabatic regimes are shown in figure  [ fig : coupling_sc ] .",
    "although strictly speaking a distinction between coherent and incoherent contributions can not be made in the case of @xmath171 [ cf .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : sc_el_spectrum ] ) ] , it is useful to separate the two terms on the r.  h.  s. of equation  ( [ eq : sc_el_spectrum ] ) , and to identify the first as the contribution of the coherent polaron band .    carrying out the transformation from @xmath172 to @xmath171 according to equation  ( [ eq : sc_el_spectrum ] ) , the weight of the coherent polaron band visible in figure  [ fig : polaron_spectrum_sc ] approximately acquires a prefactor @xmath170 .",
    "the remaining contributions to the electronic spectrum correspond to phonon - assisted photoemission processes .    in the case of @xmath171 ,",
    "the main difference between the adiabatic [ figure  [ fig : coupling_sc](a ) ] and the non - adiabatic regime [ figure  [ fig : coupling_sc](b ) ] is the significantly larger weight of the coherent band for large @xmath12 since @xmath173 .",
    "consequently , the weight contained in the incoherent excitations is noticeably reduced .",
    "the results in figures  [ fig : sc_density_w0.4 ] and  [ fig : sc_density_w2.0 ] show a certain dependence on the band filling @xmath3 , but there occur no qualitative changes even at ic @xmath167 .",

    "in fact , the electronic spectrum always remains wc / sc - like in character . in order to obtain a reasonable , analytical description of the ic regime",

    "the evolution is very similar to the large - to - small polaron cross - over in the one - electron case @xcite .",
    "note that the present results have been obtained using the hartree approximation , as discussed in section  [ sec : interm - coupl ] .    for weak coupling @xmath18 , in the adiabatic case [ figure  [ fig : free_energy_ic](a ) ]",

    "the jump of the optimal value of @xmath2 from a large to a small value at a critical @xmath18 suggests a first - order transition from an extended to a small - polaron state .",

    "the discontinuous cross - over appearing in our results for @xmath189 is a consequence of the approximation used .",
    "in contrast , in the non - adiabatic regime [ figure  [ fig : free_energy_ic](b ) ] , there exists only a single minimum , which shifts to smaller @xmath2 with increasing coupling @xmath18 .",
    "moreover , compared to figure  [ fig : free_energy_ic](a ) , the dependence of the total energy on @xmath2 is much weaker .",
    "apart from the comparison of the spectral function with other methods presented below , variational approaches  often not capable of yielding dynamic properties  are usually judged by the total energy as opposed to exact data .",

    "the missing higher - order corrections  causing the violation of the sum rule discussed earlier ",
    "lead to generally overestimated values of the energy .",
    "note that the agreement of the energy with exact results is even better in the non - adiabatic regime ( not shown ) .",
    "to illustrate the density - driven cross - over from ( large ) polarons to slightly dressed electrons ( scattered by diffusive phonons ) , figure  [ fig : e0_ep](b ) reports exact numerical results for the renormalized kinetic energy .",
    "the latter may serve as a measure for the carrier mobility .",
    "the increase as a function of @xmath3 may be interpreted as originating from the overlap of the displacement clouds surrounding the carriers and , finally , the dissociation of the polaronic quasiparticles at large @xmath3 .",
    "we again begin the discussion of the spectral functions with the adiabatic case @xmath140 .",
    "following the discussion of section  [ sec : interm - coupl ] , we determine the optimal @xmath2 from the position of the minimum of the total energy for given @xmath18 and @xmath3 ( figure  [ fig : free_energy_ic ] ) .",
    "figures  [ fig : ic_w0.4](a ) and ( b ) resemble closely to the wc and sc results of figures  [ fig : wc_density_w0.4](d ) and [ fig : sc_density_w0.4](b ) , respectively .",
    "however , for ic @xmath167 [ figure  [ fig : ic_w0.4](c ) ] , we find a rather metallic spectrum with a broad main band crossing the fermi level , and with low - energy excitations available .",
    "the corresponding polaronic spectrum ( not shown ) reveals that the variational approach correctly predicts the absence of well - defined polaronic quasiparticles , as suggested by the non - negligible incoherent contributions in @xmath91 , lying close in energy to the coherent band .",
    "this is in contrast to the sc case , where polaronic quasiparticles dominate , and in which the coherent band is well separated from the incoherent excitations .",
    "note that in figure  [ fig : ic_w0.4](c ) [ and also in figures  [ fig : ic_w2.0](c ) and  ( d ) ] the incoherent part becomes slightly negative for @xmath190 ( @xmath191 ) at large ( small ) @xmath142 , which is an artifact of our approximation .",
    "remarkably , the overall features of the spectrum in figure  [ fig : ic_w0.4](c ) are very similar to the corresponding numerical results in @xcite , reproduced in figure  [ fig : ic_w0.4](d ) .    finally , in the non - adiabatic regime , it has been found numerically that small polarons remain the correct quasiparticles even at large band fillings @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "again , the variational approach is able to describe the physics correctly . in particular , figures  [ fig : ic_w2.0](c ) and  ( d )",
    "reveal that a dominant coherent band , well separated from incoherent excitations and having a relatively small bandwidth , exists even at ic .    as for the wc and sc cases discussed above ,",
    "we have also checked the total spectral weight in the present case .",
    "we find that the deviations from the exact value of unity are largest for wc , whereas the sum rule is fulfilled to within 1 - 10% ( depending on @xmath12 and @xmath18 ) at ic and sc .",
    "we have presented an analytical treatment of the one - dimensional spinless holstein model based on calculations of the self - energy in the framework of the generalized matsubara functions . to connect the analytical results to previous numerical ones ,",
    "the electronic spectral function determining the photoemission spectrum has been computed for finite carrier concentrations in dependence on the electron - phonon coupling strength and the phonon frequency .    in the strong - coupling limit , the electron spectral function has been deduced from the spectral function of small polarons .",
    "however , it was shown that the electron picture and the small - polaron picture both cease to be correct if we approach the intermediate - coupling regime from the weak and strong - coupling side , respectively .    to describe the cross - over from the strong to the weak - coupling limit ,",
    "an interpolation scheme based on a generalization of the lang - firsov canonical transformation has been proposed .",
    "the latter was defined for each set of model parameters by a distance @xmath2 which characterizes the charge distribution across the polaron volume .",
    "the parameter @xmath2 , as deduced from the minimum of the total energy in the first approximation , was shown to increase with decreasing @xmath18corresponding to a cross - over from large to small polarons  and , at the same time , the coupling dependence of @xmath2 was found to be stronger in the adiabatic than in the non - adiabatic case .",
    "the spectral functions calculated at weak , strong and intermediate coupling are in a good agreement with recent numerical calculations . moreover , analytical results deduced by means of the self - energy calculations enabled us to distinguish between the coherent and incoherent parts of the spectrum .",
    "most importantly , starting from the strong - coupling limit , it was shown that the spectral weight of the incoherent polaron spectrum increases with decreasing coupling @xmath18 , and that the energy separation of the incoherent peaks from the coherent spectrum is continuously reduced in the adiabatic regime .",
    "on the contrary , the coherent part of the electronic ( photoemission ) spectra is reduced by a factor @xmath170 , and the incoherent part representing the phonon - assisted photoemission processes becomes increasingly dominant with increasing coupling .",
    "finally , at intermediate coupling and finite carrier densities , our results support recent numerical findings which suggest that the system can no longer be described in terms of ( small ) polaronic quasiparticles @xcite .",
