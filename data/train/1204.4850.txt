    "classical novae result from a thermonuclear runaway ( tnr ) on the surface of a white dwarf that accretes material in a close binary system  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "both galactic and extragalactic observations have suggested that there may exist two distinct populations of novae  ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "galactic observations suggest that novae associated with the disk were on average more luminous and faded more quickly than novae thought to be associated with the bulge .",
    "however , the interpretation of galactic nova data is complicated by interstellar extinction , which can be significant and varies widely with line - of - sight to a particular nova .",
    "furthermore , extinction hampers the discovery of a significant fraction of galactic novae , with only about one in four of the @xmath235 novae that are thought to erupt each year @xcite being discovered and subsequently studied in any detail  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "recent work has concentrated on extragalactic observations which offer more promise for understanding nova populations .",
    "the most thoroughly studied extragalactic system has been m31 , where more than 800 novae have been discovered over the past century @xcite . despite the considerable data amassed in recent years , evidence for distinct nova populations in extragalactic systems is conflicting , with several studies  ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) failing to establish any definitive relationship between nova properties and stellar population .    a promising avenue for the study of nova populations involves the classification of nova spectra shortly after eruption .",
    "two decades ago @xcite established that the spectra of galactic novae can be divided into one of two principal spectroscopic types , fe  ii and he / n , based on the emission lines in their spectra .",
    "novae displaying prominent fe  ii emission ( the  fe  ii \" novae ) usually show p cygni absorption profiles , and evolve more slowly , have lower expansion velocities , and lower levels of ionization , compared to novae with strong lines of he and n ( the  he / n \" novae ) .",
    "the spectroscopic types are believed to be related to fundamental properties of the progenitor binary such as the white dwarf mass .    increased access in recent years to queue scheduling on large telescopes , such as the hobby - eberly telescope ( het ) ,",
    "has made it feasible to conduct spectroscopic surveys of novae in nearby galaxies .",
    "a comprehensive photometric and spectroscopic study of m31 s nova population has been recently published by @xcite . despite the wealth of data ( spectroscopic types for a total of 91 novae",
    "were presented ) there was no clear dependence of a nova s spectroscopic type on spatial position in m31 .",
    "this result may be misleading , however , since the relatively high inclination of m31 to the plane of the sky ( @xmath3 ) makes it difficult to assign an unambiguous position within m31 to a given nova , particularly near the apparent center of m31 where the foreground disk is superimposed on the galactic bulge .",
    "light curve data for many of these novae did suggest that the more rapidly declining novae have a slightly more extended spatial distribution .",
    "in this paper we report the results of a spectroscopic survey of novae in another local group galaxy , the late - type spiral m33 .",
    "because m33 is essentially a bulgeless galaxy , novae erupting in m33 should be representative of a pure disk population , while the nova population in m31 , on the other hand , appears to be bulge - dominated @xcite .",
    "thus , a direct comparison of the properties of m33 and m31 novae will avoid the projection effects that plague the interpretation of the m31 results , and hopefully better address the question of whether the spectroscopic classes of novae vary with stellar population .",
    "spectroscopic observations were obtained using the low - resolution spectrograph @xcite on the het .",
    "initially , we employed the @xmath4 grating with a 2.0@xmath5 slit and the gg385 blocking filter , covering @xmath6  at a resolution of @xmath7 . later , to obtain more coverage at longer wavelength , we opted to use the lower resolution @xmath8 grating with a 1.0@xmath5 slit and the gg385 blocking filter .",
    "this choice increased our wavelength coverage to @xmath9  while yielding a resolution of @xmath10 . in practice ,",
    "the useful spectral range of the @xmath8 grating is limited to @xmath11  where the effects of order overlap are minimal .",
    "all het spectra were reduced using standard iraf routines to flat - field the data and to optimally extract the spectra .",
    "a summary of the het observations is given in table  [ hetdata ] .",
    "we obtained a total of six spectra of m33 nova candidates , which are shown in figures  [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] .",
    "spectra were placed on relative flux scales through comparison with observations of spectrophotometric standards routinely used at the het .",
    "because the observations were made under a variety of atmospheric conditions with the stellar image typically overfilling the spectrograph slit , our data can not be considered spectrophotometric .",
    "thus , all spectra have been displayed on a relative flux scale . in the caption for each figure",
    "we have indicated the time elapsed between discovery of the nova ( not necessarily maximum light ) and the date of our spectroscopy .      to complement our spectroscopic survey ,",
    "we were able to obtain photometry sufficient to produce light curves of four of the six novae in our spectroscopic survey .",
    "the data are given in tables  [ photobs1 ] and [ photobs2 ] , with the light curves presented in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "our primary motivation was to measure nova fade rates ( @xmath0 ) that could then be correlated with other properties , such as spectroscopic class .",
    "the photometric data consist both of targeted ( mostly @xmath12 and @xmath13-band ) observations , which were obtained primarily with the liverpool telescope ( lt , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the faulkes telescope north ( ftn , * ? ? ?",
    "the lt and ftn data were reduced using a combination of iraf and starlink software , calibrated using standard stars from @xcite , and checked against secondary standards from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the spectra of novae shortly after eruption ( days to weeks ) are characterized by an emission - line spectrum that is dominated by balmer lines . in addition , novae also often display prominent emission lines of either fe  ii ( multiplet 42 is often the strongest ) or he and n in various stages of ionization .",
    "the former group , referred to as the  fe  ii \" novae by @xcite are often characterized by p cygni - type line profiles , relatively narrow line widths ( fwhm h@xmath14 typically less than 2000 km  s@xmath15 ) , along with relatively slow spectral development over timescales of weeks .",
    "the latter class of novae , referred to as the  he / n \" novae , display higher excitation emission lines that are generally broader ( fwhm of h@xmath14 @xmath16 2500  km  s@xmath15 ) with more rectangular , castellated or flat - topped profiles .",
    "it is remarkable that nova spectra can usually be classified into one of these two distinct groups , with fe  ii novae making up @xmath280% of galactic and m31 novae @xcite .",
    "a small fraction of novae appear to have characteristics of both classes .",
    "they are referred to as either  hybrid \" or broad - lined fe  ii ( fe  iib ) novae .",
    "these novae appear similar to fe  ii novae shortly after eruption , but the lines are broader than those seen in a typical fe  ii nova . later they may evolve to display a typical he / n spectrum . on the other hand",
    "he / n novae are never seen to evolve into fe  ii novae .",
    "the classifications are robust , and with the exception of the hybrid novae , they are not particularly sensitive to the precise time during the first few weeks after eruption when the spectra are obtained .",
    "nova outbursts result from a thermonuclear runaway that occurs in the degenerate surface layers of a white dwarf that accretes matter from its companion .",
    "the resulting eruption ejects some or all of the accreted material , and in some cases may dredge up material from the white dwarf itself . whether a particular nova becomes a fe  ii , he / n or hybrid system ultimately must depend on the properties of the progenitor binary ( principally the white dwarf mass and its accretion rate ) , which govern the physical conditions in the accreted layer at the time the nova is triggered . numerical models of nova eruptions suggest that gas is ejected from the white dwarf in two distinct stages : a discrete shell of gas ejected at the time of eruption followed by steady mass loss in a wind @xcite .",
    "radiation from the ejected gas then produces the emission - line spectrum that is typical of novae shortly after eruption . according to @xcite , the fundamental characteristics of the post - eruption nova spectrum , and thus the spectroscopic classification , depends on whether the dominant emission is produced in the discrete shell or in the wind . in an",
    "he / n nova it is thought that a relatively small amount of gas is ejected quickly , with little contribution from a wind , causing the spectrum to be dominated by emission from a high - velocity shell ionized by the hot white dwarf . in an fe",
    "ii nova , a larger accreted mass results in a more massive ejecta consisting of both a relatively low density , high velocity shell and an optically - thick wind driven by residual nuclear burning on the surface of the white dwarf .",
    "models of nova eruptions show that a tnr is triggered when the temperature and density at the base of the accreted envelope become sufficiently high for nuclear burning to take place @xcite .",
    "as shown by @xcite the amount of mass that must be accreted to trigger a tnr ( the ignition mass ) is primarily a function of the white dwarf mass and temperature , with the latter being strongly influenced by the rate of accretion onto the white dwarf s surface .",
    "thus , it seems plausible to expect that nova binaries with the most massive white dwarfs and with the highest accretion rates should have the smallest accreted masses and the shortest recurrence times between eruptions .",
    "further , assuming the ejected mass is proportional to the accreted mass , such systems should be more likely to eject their mass in a discrete shell with little mass left over for residual burning on the white dwarf s surface .",
    "they would then be expected to produce he / n spectra . on the other hand ,",
    "nova progenitors harboring lower mass white dwarfs will have to accrete a greater envelope mass prior to tnr .",
    "it is these systems that are more likely to produce a higher mass of ejected material with a component in the form of an optically thick wind .",
    "such systems are expected to be characterized by fe  ii - type spectra .",
    "the first recorded m33 nova was discovered on a plate taken by f.g .",
    "pease on the night of 1919 december 14 @xcite .",
    "discoveries continued only sporadically since then with a total of 36 novae and nova candidates reported in m33 up through the end of 2010 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the number of novae discovered in recent years has increased dramatically as a result of automated surveys and increased amateur astronomer activity , with almost half of the known m33 novae being discovered in the past 15 years .",
    "a summary of known m33 novae is presented in table  [ novatable ] .      given the transient nature of novae and the challenges of scheduling time on large telescopes with short notice , it is not surprising that the vast majority of m33 nova candidates have not been confirmed spectroscopically .",
    "the first known spectrum was reported less than a decade ago by @xcite who classified m33n 2003 - 09a as a member of the fe  ii spectroscopic class . as part of a spectroscopic survey of novae in local group galaxies with the het that began in 2006 ,",

    ", @xcite obtained a spectrum of 2008 - 02a and concluded that the system was a member of the fe  ii class .",

    "the broad balmer , he , and n emission ( fwhm h@xmath14 @xmath40  km  s@xmath15 ) clearly establish the nova as a member of the he / n spectroscopic class .    in summary ,",
    "when all eight novae with observed spectra are considered ( see table  [ novatable ] ) , we find that five of the eight systems are either he / n or related systems ( fe  iib and hybrid ) , with fe  ii novae making up less than 40% of the total . despite the relatively small number of m33 novae that have been classified , this result appears to be in sharp contrast to the data for m31 and the galaxy where fe  ii novae comprise roughly 80% and 70% of the total , respectively @xcite",
    ". the somewhat higher percentage of fe  ii novae observed in m31 relative to the galaxy may reflect the fact that nova surveys have concentrated primarily on the bulge of m31 , whereas galactic data are biased to relatively nearby novae mostly located in the galactic disk .",
    "it is possible that as a result of outburst evolution our spectroscopic classifications may depend on the precise timing of the observations .",
    "for example , in hybrid novae , as the outburst progresses the spectrum evolves from a ( broad - lined ) fe  ii spectrum to that resembling an he / n spectrum . on the other hand , novae have not been observed to evolve in the opposite sense , from he / n to fe  ii class .",
    "thus , if our classifications do evolve , it will likely result in fewer novae being classified as fe  ii , and will exacerbate the discrepancy with the m31 and galactic data .",
    "one of the defining properties of the he / n spectroscopic class is that the emission line widths are considerably broader than those seen in the fe  ii novae .",
    "specifically , @xcite found that the emission lines of galactic novae in the he / n class are typically characterized by a half - width at zero intensity , hwzi @xmath41 km  s@xmath15 .",
    "empirically , we have found that for most nova line profiles the hwzi  @xmath42  fwhm ; since the latter is the more easily measured quantity , we have followed @xcite and adopted the fwhm to characterize the spectra in our survey .",
    "the values of the fwhm and the equivalent widths of h@xmath14 and h@xmath43 in our nova spectra are given in table  [ balmerline ] . without exception , as in m31 @xcite , the novae belonging to the he / n class are characterized by h@xmath14 fwhm  @xmath41  km  s@xmath15 , while the fe  ii systems all have an fwhm less than this value .",
    "although the emission line width is expected to be correlated with the expansion velocity of the nova ejecta , the fwhm does not necessarily yield the expansion velocity directly . in an fe  ii nova ,",
    "the lines are mainly produced in a wind , which originates at a distance above the surface of the white dwarf that varies as the outburst evolves .",
    "thus , the escape velocity for this wind is smaller than that at the white dwarf s surface . as a result , the derived expansion velocity ( and hence line width ) may decrease with the time elapsed since eruption .",
    "in an he / n nova , on the other hand , the broad emission features are believed to be formed mainly in a discrete , optically - thin shell ejected at relatively high velocity from near the white dwarf s surface .",
    "the line profiles are expected to be flat - topped with the fwhm closely approximating the ejection velocity of the shell .      to further explore the properties of the novae in our survey , whenever possible we have augmented our spectroscopic data with available photometric observations .",
    "unfortunately , we could find no light curve information for m33 novae erupting prior to the start of our het spectroscopic survey in 2006 .",
    "nevertheless , we have sufficient photometric data to estimate decline rates for half of the novae ( four of eight ) in our spectroscopic sample .",
    "a convenient and widely used parameterization of the decline rate is @xmath0 , which represents the time ( in days ) for a nova to decline 2 mag from maximum light . according to the criteria of @xcite , novae with @xmath44 days",
    "are considered  fast \" or  very fast \" , with the slowest novae characterized by @xmath0 values of several months or longer .",
    "rates of decline , and corresponding values of @xmath0 , have been measured for the 4 novae in our photometric sample by performing weighted linear least - squares fits to the declining portion of the light curves that extend up to 3 mag below peak . in an attempt to account for systematic errors in the individual photometric measurements ,",
    "the weights used in the fits were composed of the sum of the formal errors on the individual photometric measurements plus a constant systematic error estimate of 0.1 mag .",
    "the net effect of including the systematic error component was a reduction of the relative weighting of points with small formal errors and a corresponding increase in the formal errors of the best - fit parameters and in the uncertainties in @xmath0 derived from them .",
    "because our photometric observations do not always begin immediately after discovery , and the date of discovery does not always represent the date of eruption , we have made two modifications to our photometric data in order to better estimate the light curve parameters .",
    "first , when available , we have augmented our light curve data with the discovery dates and magnitudes given in the catalog of @xcite .",
    "secondly , for some novae we have modified ( brightened ) the peak magnitude slightly through an extrapolation of the declining portion of the light curve by up to 2.5 days pre - discovery in cases where upper flux limits ( within five days of discovery ) are available .",
    "finally , apparent magnitudes at the time of discovery have been converted to estimates of the absolute magnitude at maximum light by adopting distance moduli for m33 of @xmath45 and @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "the light curve parameters resulting from our analysis are given in table  [ lcparam ] .",
    "in agreement with the results of both the galactic study by  @xcite and the m31 study by @xcite , it appears that the he / n novae in m33 are generally ",
    "faster \" than their fe  ii counterparts , as expected for novae with more massive white dwarfs  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the projected positions of the 36 known m33 novae from table  [ novatable ] are shown in figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "for the 8 novae with known spectroscopic class we have plotted the fe  ii systems as filled circles and the he / n and hybrid novae as filled squares . observations by @xcite suggest that fe  ii and he / n novae are associated with different stellar populations : the he / n novae primarily with the galactic disk and the fe  ii novae with thick disk and bulge .",
    "given that m33 is a nearly bulgeless galaxy , classified as an scd galaxy @xcite , the spatial distributions of the fe  ii and he / n novae are not expected to differ significantly .",
    "m33 is oriented at an angle of @xmath47 with respect to the plane of the sky .",
    "thus , in order to approximate the true position of a nova within m33 , we have assigned each nova an isophotal radius , defined as the length of the semi - major axis of an elliptical isophote computed from the @xmath48-band surface photometry of @xcite that passes through the observed position of the nova . in figure",
    "[ fig5 ] , we show the cumulative distribution the m33 novae compared with the cumulative @xmath49-band light from the surface photometry of @xcite . a kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test reveals that the distributions would be expected to differ by more than that observed 39% of the time if they were drawn from the same parent population .",
    "thus , there is no reason to reject the hypothesis that the novae follow the light distribution in m33 .",
    "we have also shown the cumulative distributions of the fe  ii and he / n ( and hybrid ) novae separately , although we have insufficient data to draw any conclusions regarding whether these distributions may differ .",
    "the answer to the question of whether or not there exist two distinct populations of novae has remained elusive , with observational support for both sides of the issue .",
    "for example , an analysis of spectroscopic observations of galactic novae by @xcite suggests that he / n novae are generally located closer to the galactic plane than are the fe  ii novae , suggesting that the he / n novae belong to a younger stellar population compared with the latter class of novae . on the other hand",
    ", the recent spectroscopic survey of novae in m31 by @xcite finds no significant difference in the spatial distributions of the he / n and fe  ii novae in that galaxy .    in an attempt to gain further insight into the question of whether the spectroscopic class of novae is sensitive to stellar population",
    ", we have initiated a spectroscopic survey of novae in the late - type , nearly bulgeless spiral galaxy , m33 . despite the fact that the absolute nova rate in m33 is only @xmath50 per year @xcite",
    ", we were able to secure spectra for six novae thus far since our survey began in 2006 . after including spectroscopic observations of two additional novae from the literature",
    ", we were ultimately able to establish spectroscopic classes for a total of eight novae in m33 .",
    "of the eight , only two novae ( m33n 2006 - 09a and 2008 - 02a ) are clearly members of the fe  ii class , with a third nova , 2003 - 09a , possibly being a member of the fe  iib class . of the remaining novae ,",
    "three are clearly he / n novae , with two being fe  iib or hybrid objects .",
    "although the number of spectra available for m33 is currently small relative to m31 , it is already clear that the fraction of fe ii novae in m33 is surprisingly low . we can estimate the significance of this result as follows .",
    "let @xmath51 be the fraction of novae occurring within a galaxy with the spectroscopic classification fe ii , and let @xmath52 be the fraction of novae with spectroscopic classification he / n ( + fe iib ) . the probability of observing @xmath53 fe ii novae out of a sample of @xmath54 objects is simply @xmath55 and the probability of observing @xmath53 or fewer fe ii novae is @xmath56 under the null hypothesis that the novae in m33 have the same ratio of spectroscopic types as that seen in m31 , we have @xmath57 and @xmath58 , and the probability of observing three or fewer fe  ii novae is @xmath59 . in other words ,",
    "the mix of spectroscopic nova types in m33 differs from that of m31 at the 99% confidence level .",
    "this result is perhaps not surprising given that the spectroscopic class of novae is expected to depend on fundamental physical properties of the nova progenitor binary such as the mass of the white dwarf .",
    "the average mass of the white dwarfs in nova binaries , in turn , is thought to be sensitive to the age of the underlying stellar population in the sense that a younger stellar population , like that which dominates in m33 , should contain , on average , higher mass white dwarfs  ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "it therefore appears plausible that the observed difference in the mix of nova types in m31 and m33 might be related to the difference in stellar population between the two galaxies .",
    "in addition to obtaining spectroscopic observations of m33 novae , we were able to measure light curves ( and resulting @xmath0 times ) for the majority of the novae in our sample , and for half of the novae with known spectroscopic class .",
    "although our small sample does not allow us to study the spatial distribution of speed class as we were able to do in the case of m31  @xcite , we did find , as expected , that of the four novae with measured @xmath0 , the fastest declining systems ( m33n 2007 - 09a and 2009 - 01a ) were members of the he / n spectroscopic class , while the slowest nova , 2006 - 09a , was found to be a member of the fe  ii class .",
    "finally , by considering the positions of all 36 novae seen to erupt in m33 over the past century  @xcite , we were able to explore the spatial distribution of novae across the galaxy .",
    "although the available dataset is too limited to study the distributions of the fe  ii and he / n novae separately , we did find that the overall nova distribution is consistent with that expected if the nova rate is proportional to the surface brightness distribution in the galaxy .    in order to confirm our preliminary findings , future observational efforts should focus not only on continued optical imaging to discover additional m33 nova candidates , but also on the timely spectroscopic and photometric follow - up observations required to increase the number of available spectroscopic and speed classifications .",
    "in addition , x - ray observations to measure the timing and duration of the nova supersoft stage can be used provide useful constraints on the properties of nova binaries in m33 , as they have in studies of novae in m31  ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the work presented here was made possible through observations obtained from facilities based throughout the world .",
    "spectroscopic observations were obtained with the lick observatory s shane 3  m telescope operated by the university of california and with the marcario low resolution spectrograph on the hobby - eberly telescope , which is operated by mcdonald observatory on behalf of the university of texas at austin , the pennsylvania state university , stanford university , the ludwig - maximillians - universitaet , munich , and the george - august - universitaet , goettingen .",
    "photometric observations were made using the liverpool telescope , which is operated on the island of la palma by liverpool john moores university ( ljmu ) in the spanish observatorio del roque de los muchachos of the instituto de astrofisica de canarias with financial support from the uk science and technology facilities council ( stfc ) .",
    "faulkes telescope north ( ftn ) is operated by the las cumbres observatory global telescope network .",
    "data from ftn were obtained as part of a joint programme between las cumbres observatory and ljmu astrophysics research institute .",
    "finally , we thank k. nishiyama and f. kabashima for their tireless efforts to monitor m33 for erupting novae , and two anonymous referees for their comments on earlier versions of the manuscript .",
    "a.w.s . is also grateful to the nsf for financial support through grants ast-0607682 and ast-1009566 .",

    "<S> we report the initial results from an ongoing multi - year spectroscopic survey of novae in m33 . </S>",
    "<S> the survey resulted in the spectroscopic classification of six novae ( m33n 2006 - 09a , 2007 - 09a , 2009 - 01a , 2010 - 10a , 2010 - 11a , and 2011 - 12a ) and a determination of rates of decline ( @xmath0 times ) for four of them ( 2006 - 09a , 2007 - 09a , 2009 - 01a , and 2010 - 10a ) . </S>",
    "<S> when these data are combined with existing spectroscopic data for two additional m33 novae ( 2003 - 09a and 2008 - 02a ) we find that five of the eight novae with available spectroscopic class appear to be members of either the he / n or fe  iib ( hybrid ) classes , with only two clear members of the fe  ii spectroscopic class . </S>",
    "<S> this initial finding is very different from what would be expected based on the results for m31 and the galaxy where fe  ii novae dominate , and the he / n and fe  iib classes together make up only @xmath1% of the total . </S>",
    "<S> it is plausible that the increased fraction of he / n and fe  iib novae observed in m33 thus far may be the result of the younger stellar population that dominates this galaxy , which is expected to produce novae that harbor generally more massive white dwarfs than those typically associated with novae in m31 or the milky way . </S>"
