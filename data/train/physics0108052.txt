    "recent experiments achieving the trapping and bose condensation of atoms with hyperfine structure @xcite have created a lot of theoretical interest in the behavior of atomic gases with internal degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "most of this interest has focused on how the presence of internal degrees of freedom effect the spatial behavior , such as the hydrodynamical modes or vortices .",
    "an equally important question posed by these experiments is how the internal states of the atoms are effected by interactions .    in a variety of experiments",
    "the transitions between internal states are used to either manipulate or probe cold gases .",
    "fountain atomic clocks @xcite use ramsey spectroscopy technique to measure the energy differences between internal states very precisely , and have found that this energy difference depends on the densities of the different internal states in the gas .",
    "another class of experiments have used electromagnetically induced transparency @xcite techniques to excite the atoms into a superposition of internal states by absorbing a ` probe ' beam and were able reemit the beam after some delay .",
    "these experiments measured the change in the ` stopped ' light beam as the gas evolved in the superposition state @xcite .",
    "both of these classes of experiments measure the internal dynamics of the atoms in a normal gas .",
    "experiments involving change in the internal state of the atoms have also been carried out on bose einstein condensates ( bec ) . in the mit spin polarized hydrogen experiment @xcite ,",
    "bec was detected by changing the internal states of the atoms from 1s to 2s using a two photon excitation .",
    "two photon transitions have also been successfully employed by the jila group in a number of experiments to create topological excitations @xcite or phase textures@xcite in a rubidium bec .",
    "one can expect many related experiments to be carried out in near future as the study of cold atomic gases is a rapidly expanding field .",
    "although all these experiments try to elucidate the internal dynamics of a cold gas , it is useful to classify them into two groups with respect to the strength of the external field that couples to the internal states . in the weak field limit ,",
    "experiments probe the internal dynamics of a gas of atoms in the absence of an external field . for example , in the atomic clock experiments , although strong fields at the beginning and the end of ramsey spectroscopy are required , an essentially free evolution of the wavefunction in a superposition of two internal states is measured . in the mit hydrogen experiment @xcite ,",
    "the number of excited atoms is a small fraction of the total number , and thus all the effects measured are linear in the excitation rate . thus the external field is only a weak probe of the free dynamics . on the other hand , in the strong field limit",
    "the internal dynamics is sensitive to the intensity of the external field , and the number of atoms changing their internal state form a large fraction that may reach 100% . in the jila experiments , by applying a @xmath0 pulse all the atoms are transferred from one internal state to the other , and duration of the pulse is the inverse of rabi frequency , showing that the internal dynamics depends on the strength of the external field .",
    "it should be also kept in mind that in all these experiments , even in the weak field limit , the external field has large enough number of quanta to be treated as a classical field .",
    "also we will assume throughout that the excitation is carried out by a coherent field .",
    "the interaction between two atoms generally depends on their internal states @xcite . for the dilute cold gases considered in this work",
    ", interactions can be simply characterized by the s - wave scattering lengths @xmath1 which depend on the internal states @xmath2 and @xmath3 of the interacting atoms .",
    "thus a two state problem will have three different scattering lengths . to be in the purely s - wave scattering limit the gas has to be cold enough , so that @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the largest of the s - wave scattering lengths in the problem and @xmath6 is the thermal de broglie wavelength .",
    "the temperature range defined by the criterion ( [ quantumgascondition ] ) corresponds to the so - called cold collision regime .",
    "it is important to realize that the inequality ( [ quantumgascondition ] ) not only defines the condition for the s - wave scattering to be dominant , but also is a criterion for quantum statistical effects ( indistinguishibility of the particles ) to be observable . to see this ,",
    "consider an evolution of the state of one particular atom .",
    "this atom will experience two different kinds of scattering processes : the coherent forward and backward scattering which preserves correlation of the momentum state with the internal state , as well as ordinary elastic collisions causing scattering at an angle different from 0 or @xmath0 which destroy this correlation @xcite .",
    "the forward and backward processes occur with the ` rate ' @xmath7 while the ordinary elastic collisions rate is @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the thermal velocity . comparing these two rates",
    "one can see that the coherent processes happen at a much higher rate in the temperature range ( [ quantumgascondition ] ) .",
    "it is then possible to measure the frequency shifts of the internal states and decide the statistics of the system .",
    "the gases satisfying the condition ( [ quantumgascondition ] ) are called quantum gases @xcite .    for the densities relevant for the alkali gas experiments , the temperatures below which the gas becomes quantum in the sense ( [ quantumgascondition ] ) are much larger than the bose - einstein condensation temperature .",
    "[ this is true because quantum degeneracy becomes important only at the lower temperatures for which the thermal de broglie wavelength is the order of average interparticle spacing , @xmath10 . ] for bose systems the substantial overlap between wavefunctions of different particles and bosonic tendency to be in the same state then causes bose ",
    "einstein condensation , where a finite fraction of the particles of the gas share the same spatial wavefunction .",
    "the internal states of the particles define the interactions between the particles , thus determine the self - consistent spatial wavefunction that all the particles share @xcite , transition between internal states are also effected in return .",
    "most importantly , there are no backward(exchange ) scatterings between two bosons sharing the same spatial wavefunction , and the mean field energy shift for a particle in the condensate is different from a particle in the normal gas .",
    "an important example of the modification of the transitions between the internal states upon condensation is given by the internal josephson effect @xcite .",
    "in this effect , the internal states act as the two reservoirs and the external field provides the weak link between these two reservoirs similar to the tunneling coupling through a barrier in the ordinary spatial josephson effect @xcite .",
    "although the jila experiments @xcite have come close , the internal josephson effect has not been observed in the alkali gases to date , mostly due to the fact that the shape of the condensate is different for the two internal states .",
    "any transition between the two internal states causes spatial disturbances , making the internal josephson oscillations hard to observe .",
    "it should however be possible observe the effect by either using a very shallow trap or going to the adiabatic limit in which the rabi frequency for transitions is much larger than the oscillation frequencies of the condensate in the trap @xcite .",
    "we will consider the case of a homogeneous gas and investigate the internal josephson effect , having in mind a gas sample in a very shallow trap .    to understand these different phenomena in a general framework ,",
    "we first derive the transport equation for the density matrix of the system , treating the external degrees of freedom semi  classically .",
    "the transport equation can be used to understand transitions between internal states of a bose gas in the presence of spatial non - uniformity caused by a trapping potential , as well as in the presence of macroscopic flows , such as currents created by a vortex .    below we focus on the dynamics of internal states in a spatially uniform system .",
    "we assume that all the excitation fields are applied uniformly on a homogeneous sample .",
    "we find the equations of motion for the internal state density matrix of both the normal component and the condensed part of a bose gas .",
    "then we use a bloch sphere representation @xcite for the density matrix to get an equivalent equation of motion for classical spins .    after deriving the equations of motion we consider two simple cases : a normal gas and a fully condensed gas .",
    "we find the free precession frequencies for the relative phase of two internal states , which leads to an expression for the density dependence of the frequency shift in fountain atomic clocks .",
    "our results for the normal gas agree with previous work @xcite , and we present a new result for the fully condensed case .",
    "then we investigate the response of the bose gas to an external field when it is either above condensation temperature or at zero temperature , _",
    "i.e. _ fully condensed . for the fully condensed bose gas",
    "we show how the rabi oscillations in a non - interacting gas turn into the internal josephson oscillations , and calculate the oscillation frequencies exactly for the entire parameter range . by repeating the same analysis for a non - condensed gas , we find that the internal josephson effect exists in a cold non - condensed gas .",
    "this somewhat surprising result shows that the josephson effect does not require a broken symmetry , and can be observed in any coherent system .",
    "we calculate the frequencies for the normal case and compare with the results for condensed gas .",
    "we also compare the internal josephson oscillations with the spatial josephson oscillations discussed in @xcite and show that ` macroscopic quantum self trapping ' effect is also present for the internal josephson effect .",
    "in the next section , we study the internal dynamics of a bose gas which has comparable densities of condensed and normal components .",
    "we first discuss the dynamics without an external coupling field and calculate the oscillation frequencies for the condensate density in each internal state . in the limit of small oscillation amplitude",
    "out result agrees with the resonance frequencies calculated for the mit hydrogen spectrum @xcite .",
    "we briefly discuss the behavior of the system under a strong external field .",
    "finally we give the transport equation and the equations of motion for the internal density matrix of a fermi gas .",
    "we consider a freely precessing state and its response to an external field , and compare the results with those for the bose gas .",
    "a dilute bose gas in a confining potential @xmath11 can be described by the hamiltonian @xmath12 where the greek indices @xmath2 , @xmath3 run over all internal states .",
    "the potential energy @xmath13 includes the internal energies @xmath14 of the states @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and the interaction parameters @xmath17 are related to the s - wave scattering lengths @xmath18 as @xmath19 for a problem with @xmath20 internal levels there are @xmath21 interaction strengths @xmath22 to be specified .",

    "the requirement of being hermitian gives @xmath28 .",
    "in the case of bose condensation we can treat the @xmath29 operators as having non - zero expectation values .",
    "this is achieved by a substitution @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a c - number representing the condensate wavefunction .    to describe the dynamics of the internal states of the normal gas , we need the populations of each level , as well as the coherences between any two states .",
    "thus we define the full density matrix @xmath32 and the internal density matrix @xmath33 , both being @xmath34 hermitian matrices for @xmath20 internal states : @xmath35    the internal dynamics of the condensate can be described by specifying complex amplitudes of internal states , in total @xmath20 complex numbers for an @xmath20 component condensate .",
    "we find it useful , in order to keep track of relative phases of condensate internal states , to introduce an @xmath34 matrix similar to the density matrix of normal states @xmath36",

    "the most important restriction on the above equations ( [ transport],[continuity ] ) is that they are valid for times not longer than the elastic scattering time @xmath58 however , for a cold gas the characteristic frequency of the evolution described by ( [ transport],[continuity ] ) is much higher than @xmath59 , and this approximation gets better as the temperature is decreased .",

    "all other effects , such as the difference of the trap potential for different internal states , or density oscillations created by a change in the internal state are adequately described by ( [ transport],[continuity ] ) within the hartree - fock approximation .",
    "our main interest in this paper will be the consequences of interparticle interactions in the internal state dynamics , so we will simplify the above general equations by assuming that we are in a uniform system , with no normal or condensate flows , and further assume that the external fields are applied uniformly . in this case",
    "we will have no need for the full density matrix @xmath32 , as internal dynamics is completely described @xmath33 which will be the same at all points r.    thus equations of motion reduce to @xmath61 @xmath62 where @xmath63 are defined as , @xmath64    the dynamics described in the above equations are fairly complicated if there are fields coupling more then two states , so we will concentrate on the simplest case , where only two internal states are coupled , and all the populations in the other states remain constant . in this case we will be concerned with the dynamics of two , two by two matrices .",
    "one for the normal gas and one for the condensate .",
    "let us assume that states 1 and 2 are coupled .",
    "we can go to a larmor basis with the frequency of the coupling field so that the elements of our density matrix ( and similarly the condensate matrix ) can be redefined .",

    "for the normal part , the norm of the projection of spin onto the @xmath71 plane represents the degree of coherence between the two internal states . for the condensate spin",

    "the factor of @xmath82 difference in the normal spin ",
    "normal spin interaction compared to the condensate spin ",
    "condensate spin interaction stems from the fact that there are no exchange scatterings within the condensate .",
    "the terms coupling the condensate spin with the normal spin arise from processes in which an atom in one internal state goes through an exchange scattering process with a condensate atom in another internal state .",
    "we start the analysis of the dynamics described in eq.([spineom ] ) by considering the situation in which we can represent the system by a single spin .",
    "there are two such cases .",
    "the first is at zero temperature , when almost all the atoms are in the condensate ; while the second is above the transition temperature , when there is no condensate present .",
    "however , our analysis is still restricted to temperatures low enough to satisfy the quantum gas condition , @xmath83 .",
    "we first analyze equations of motion eq.([spineom ] ) in the case where there is no external field . such an analysis is needed to understand any interaction related effects in experiments where particles spend a substantial amount of time in a superposition state , such as atomic clocks @xcite .",
    "let us first consider the case where there is no bose condensation .",
    "thus our equations ( [ spineom ] ) will be reduced to @xmath84    we can easily see that the z component of the spin will be conserved and we will only have a precession around the z axis and the precession frequency will be @xmath85 this result agrees with the theory of frequency shifts in atomic clocks @xcite .    we can now ask the same question for a sample which is fully condensed . when all the atoms are in the condensate , they will all be sharing the same spatial wavefunction , this will mean that no exchange processes will be possible .",
    "that would eliminate the factor of 2 multiplying the combination of @xmath86 and @xmath87 s for states one and two in the previous equation .",
    "not surprisingly we get , for a fully condensed sample @xmath88    although it is not desirable to use a condensate in a fountain atomic clock due to very high density shifts that would result .",
    "we see here that such an experiment can be used to probe the correlations in a condensate by simply looking at the density induced frequency shifts .",
    "in this section we consider the response to an external field , only when the system can be represented by a single spin , _",
    "i.e. _ the system is either fully condensed or not condensed at all . in the former case ,",
    "when the system is at zero temperature we have two condensates in internal states @xmath89 and @xmath82 , which are connected by the `` weak link '' supplied by the external field .",
    "this is the well studied problem of the internal josephson effect @xcite .",
    "the important difference between the spatial josephson problem and the internal josephson problem is that in the latter atoms in different internal states interact , while in the former two particles in different reservoirs do not .",
    "however if the interaction between the two internal states is taken to be zero @xmath90 then equations for the internal josephson problem reduce to that of the spatial problem @xcite .",
    "thus the internal effect displays all the phenomena the spatial josephson effect has .    as in the spatial josephson problem",
    "there are three different regimes depending on the strength of the coupling between the internal states @xcite . if the external field is much stronger than the interactions @xmath91 the system is said to be in the rabi regime .",
    "( here @xmath86 can be taken to be the largest of @xmath22 and @xmath87 the total density . ) in this regime interactions are not important and the system experiences large oscillations in the density of each internal state . in the opposite regime , when the external field is extremely weak , @xmath92 the system is in the fock regime .",
    "the amplitude of density oscillations is negligible and the phase difference between the two states evolves as in the free precession case discussed in the previous section . between these two regimes",
    "is the josephson regime , for which , @xmath93 in this regime , the density imbalance between the two internal states go through small oscillations , similar to the usual spatial josephson effect .",
    "all three regimes are described by eq.[[spineom ] ] , which reduces to @xmath94 \\hat{z } ,    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] at zero temperature .    as the dynamics conserves the magnitude of the spin we only have two dynamical variables , which can be taken as angles @xmath95 in the spherical polar coordinates representing the orientation of the spin .",
    "another conserved quantity in this dynamics is the hamiltonian introduced earlier , @xmath96    on the sphere defined by @xmath95 , contours of constant @xmath97 will define the paths along which the spin will precess .",
    "we can write the hamiltonian as a function of @xmath95 as @xmath98 and identify @xmath99    at strong external fields the paths are almost circular with centers on the line oriented along vector @xmath100 , passing through the origin , as in the usual rabi problem , and significant changes in the populations occur throughout the course of a rabi oscillation . as a function of @xmath101 and @xmath102",
    "the hamiltonian has one maximum and one minimum , thus all the trajectories circle these extremum points , if the external field satisfies @xmath103    when the intrinsic rabi frequency @xmath104 becomes the order of the density caused shifts @xmath105 , we get into the josephson regime . even on resonance , large population transfers from one state to another does not take place .",
    "this can be easily seen from the structure of trajectories on the bloch sphere .",
    "when the external field does not satisfy ( [ condition ] ) , instead of having one minimum and one maximum , the hamiltonian has two maxima , one minimum and a saddle point .",
    "the two constant h trajectories crossing at the saddle point separate the sphere into three regions , giving us three kind of trajectories , circling around the minimum or one of the two maxima . none of these oscillations however , result in large population transfers , which is in contrast with the rabi problem , in which one can change internal states of all the atoms with an arbitrarily small field on resonance .",
    "josephson effect can be understood if we realize that the transition frequency for an atom depends on the populations .",
    "so for weak fields even a small population transfer carries the transition away from resonance , _ i.e. _ makes the effective detuning much larger than the rabi frequency .",
    "we can calculate the oscillation frequency along each path , for both high and low fields .",

    "any value of h in this range will uniquely correspond to one trajectory and the period of motion on such a trajectory will be given by @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the complete elliptic integral @xcite , @xmath116 , @xmath117 are the real roots , m is the real part and n is the absolute value of the imaginary part of the remaining two complex conjugate roots of the polynomial in eq.([integral ] ) .    in the weak field case",
    "there are 4 special values of the hamiltonian , @xmath113 , the minimum value , @xmath118 the value at the saddle point , @xmath119 and @xmath120 , the smaller and the larger of the values at the two maxima respectively ( see figure 1 ) . for @xmath121 values in the range @xmath122 or @xmath123",
    "there is again one to one correspondence between h values and trajectories on the sphere . for such trajectories",
    "the frequencies are again given by ( [ imagk ] ) .",
    "for the values of @xmath121 satisfying @xmath124 there are two trajectories corresponding to each @xmath121 , one circling around @xmath125 , and the other circling around @xmath120",
    ". however they both have the same period given by @xmath126 where @xmath115 is again the complete elliptic integral and @xmath127 are the four real roots of the polynomial in eq.([integral ] ) .",
    "a typical plot of frequencies for the weak field case is given in figure 2 .",
    "near the saddle point trajectories slow down logarithmically in @xmath128 as expected from a two dimensional dynamics .",
    "we can see for @xmath129 that our equations reduce to those obtained in @xcite by using two coupled gross - pitaevskii equations . at high field",
    "we get almost circular trajectories , and correspondingly large oscillations between internal levels of the condensate , as in the rabi problem . for the low field case",
    "we get three kind of trajectories all of which give little population change , these correspond to josephson oscillations .",
    "two of these three kinds complete a full cycle around the z axis , while the third is trapped in a region for which @xmath130 .",
    "recalling that @xmath102 represents the relative phase of the two condensates , we see that these trajectories correspond to josephson oscillations between the two internal states , caused by the weak link of the external field .",
    "the other two kinds of trajectories again correspond to josephson oscillations , however in these class of josephson oscillations there is a @xmath131 phase slip for every period of population change .",
    "such oscillations are called @xmath0 josephson oscillations @xcite .",
    "it has been shown for the spatial josephson effect that the system can dynamically maintain a population imbalance between the two macroscopically occupied states @xcite .",
    "we can ask whether the internal josephson effect also shows this `` macroscopic quantum self trapping '' effect . this question is meaningful",
    "only if a symmetry exists between states @xmath89 and @xmath82 @xmath132 if the internal states have different interactions a population imbalance is to be expected in any oscillation as the system will be biased to choose the internal state with lower interaction energy .",
    "if we take @xmath133 , our condition for the appearance of the extra maximum in the hamiltonian becomes @xmath134 as @xmath135 in this case .",
    "one can immediately see that out of the three types of trajectories discussed for the general case , those corresponding to @xmath0 josephson oscillations become macroscopically self trapped oscillations for @xmath133 .",
    "it is remarkable that none of the arguments given for the internal josephson effect depend on the macroscopic occupation of a spatial state , _",
    "i.e. _ bose condensation .",
    "in fact if we assume that the system is not condensed @xmath136 we get the equation for the precession of the normal spin from eq.([spineom ] ) @xmath137 \\hat{z}.    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this equation is very similar to the equation for the condensate spin , and all the results found in this section apply for the non - condensed case if we identify @xmath138 the behavior of the fully condensed and non - condensed cases are similar , however the values of the precession frequencies and critical value of the external field are different .",
    "this difference , again , is a result of the fact that there are no exchange scattering processes in a bose condensate .    from the above discussion",
    "we come to the conclusion that to observe the internal josephson effect it is not required to have two bose condensed samples .",
    "two words of caution should be voiced about this observation .",
    "first we have only considered the coherent collisions and the coherence of the phase of two internal levels will be destroyed on a time scale that is set by mean free time in the gas .",
    "any observed internal josephson oscillation in a non - condensed sample should decay in this time scale .",
    "second , to be able to see this effect one has to go to very low field strengths such that the population oscillations should be observable in a non - condensed sample .",
    "still we have shown that it is not absolutely necessary to have bose condensation to observe small oscillations in the relative phase of the internal states under a small excitation field .",
    "let us imagine a non - condensed gas of atoms put into a superposition of two internal states by a @xmath139 pulse .",
    "if this sample is further subjected to weak mixing field on resonance one would naively expect population transfer from one internal level to the other with the rabi frequency of the field .",
    "however our discussion shows that if the sample and the field satisfy @xmath140 we would have small oscillations of the phase and populations , which is exactly what is observed in the internal josephson effect with condensed samples .",
    "after analyzing the fully condensed and non - condensed bose gas , both of which can be represented by only one spin in our equations ( [ spineom ] ) , we turn our attention to the partially condensed bose gas .",
    "when the temperature is between zero and condensation temperature , @xmath141 , there is both a condensed and a non - condensed density present .",
    "if these densities are comparable we have to use the full form of eq.([spineom ] ) , with both spins present .",
    "we first start with the free precession problem , _",
    "i.e. _ by setting the external field equal to zero . in this case",
    "we have the equations @xmath142 the effective magnetic fields @xmath143 and @xmath144 both point in the @xmath145 direction and are defined in eq.([magfields ] ) . as",
    "their time derivatives are perpendicular to the spin vectors , norm of both of the spins , @xmath146 and @xmath147 are conserved .",
    "this conservation simply means that the total number of atoms in the condensate and over the condensate are conserved .",
    "another conserved quantity can be obtained by adding eq.([frees ] ) to eq.([freesc ] ) and taking the @xmath145 component .",
    "we have @xmath148 physically this conservation law corresponds to the fact that in the absence of a coupling field the total number of atoms in internal states 1 and 2 are conserved separately . although these three conservation laws restrict the resulting dynamics considerably , they still allow oscillations in which the density of condensed and non - condensed atoms in internal state 1 change , while state two goes through the same oscillations out of phase with 1 to leave the total number of condensed and non - condensed atoms constant . in our spin representation",
    "the degree of freedom that expresses these oscillations will be @xmath149 , or equivalently @xmath150 as they add up to a constant .",
    "the other conserved quantity is the hamiltonian ( [ spinh ] ) which we choose to rewrite in terms of the conserved quantities @xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 and the dynamical variable @xmath149 as @xmath154    to investigate the oscillations of the degree of freedom physically described above and represented by @xmath149 we take the equation of motion for @xmath149 @xmath155 we define @xmath156 to be the volume of the parallelepiped formed by the vectors @xmath145 , @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
