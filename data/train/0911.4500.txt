    "oscar zariski ( 18991986 ) was a central figure in 20th century mathematics .",
    "his life , ably recounted in @xcite , took him from a small city in white russia , through his advanced training under the masters of the `` italian school '' of algebraic geometry , and to a distinguished career in the united states , the precursor of a tide of emigrant talent fleeing political upheaval in europe .",
    "as a professor at johns hopkins and harvard university , he supervised the ph.d.s of some of the most outstanding mathematicians of the era , including two fields medalists , and his mathematical tribe ( traced through advisors in @xcite ) now numbers more than 800 .",
    "zariski thoroughly absorbed and built upon the synthetic arguments of the italian school , and in @xcite he gave a definitive account of the classical theory of algebraic surfaces . in the course of writing this volume ,",
    "however , despite his admiration for their deep geometric insight he became increasingly disgruntled with the lack of rigor in certain arguments . he was thus led to search for more adequate foundations for algebraic geometry , taking ( along with andre weil ) many of the first steps in an eventual revolutionary recasting of these foundations by alexander grothendieck and others .    in a 1962 paper @xcite",
    ", zariski introduced the decomposition theory that now bears his name .",
    "although it arose in the context of algebraic geometry and deals with the configuration of curves on an algebraic surface , we have recently observed that the essential concept is purely within the realm of linear algebra .",
    "( a similar observation has been made independently by moriwaki in section 1 of @xcite . ) in this paper , we formulate zariski decomposition as a theorem in linear algebra and present a linear algebraic proof . to motivate the construction ,",
    "however , we begin in section [ origcontext ] with a breezy account of the the original geometric situation , and eventually return to this situation in section [ windup ] to round off the discussion and present one substantive example .",
    "we give only a sketchy description which lacks even proper definitions ; one needs a serious course in algebraic geometry to treat these matters in a rigorous way .",
    "but , as already indicated , the thrust of the paper is in a far different direction , namely toward disentangling the relatively elementary linear algebra from these more advanced ideas . beginning in section [ decomp ] ,",
    "our treatment is both elementary and explicit ; a basic course in linear algebra , which includes the idea of a negative definite matrix , should be a sufficient background . after laying out the definitions and the main idea , we present a simple new construction ( which first appeared in @xcite ) and",
    "show that it satisfies the requirements for a zariski decomposition .",
    "we look at a few elaborations , and we present zariski s original algorithm ( shorn of its original geometric context ) .",
    "the study of algebraic curves , with its ties to the theory of riemann surfaces and many other central ideas of mathematics , has ancient roots , but our understanding of algebraic surfaces has developed more recently .",
    "one of zariski s main concerns was how to extend well - known fundamental theories from curves to surfaces . in trying to understand such a surface ,",
    "one is naturally led to study the algebraic curves which live on it , asking what sorts of curves there are , how they meet each other , and how their configurations influence the geometry of the surface .",
    "for example , in the plane ( the simplest example of an algebraic surface ) an algebraic curve is the solution set of a polynomial equation @xmath0 .",
    "one can calculate that the vector space of all polynomials in two variables of degree not exceeding @xmath1 is a vector space of dimension @xmath2 .",
    "since two such polynomials define the same curve if and only if one is a multiple of the other , we say that the set of all such curves forms a _ linear system _ of dimension @xmath3 .",
    "( in general , the dimension of a linear system is one less than the dimension of the corresponding vector space of functions . ) more generally , for each curve @xmath4 on an algebraic surface one can naturally define an associated linear system of curves which are equivalent in a certain sense to @xmath4 , denoting it by @xmath5 .",
    "this linear system depends not just on the curve as a set of points but also on the equation which defines it : the equation @xmath6 defines a larger linear system than does @xmath0 , and we denote this larger linear system by @xmath7 .",
    "( for a curve of degree @xmath1 in the plane , @xmath7 consists of all curves of degree @xmath8 . )",
    "his student david mumford ( in an appendix to @xcite ) says that ",
    "zariski s papers on the general topic of linear systems form a rather coherent whole in which one can observe at least two major themes which he developed repeatedly .",
    "one is the riemann - roch problem : to compute the dimension of a general linear system  and especially to consider the behavior of @xmath9 as @xmath10 grows .",
    "the other is to apply the theory of linear systems in the 2-dimensional case to obtain results on the birational geometry of surfaces and on the classification of surfaces . in relation to his previous work , this research was , i believe , something like a dessert . he had worked long setting up many new algebraic techniques and laying rigorous foundations for doing geometry  and linear systems , which are the heart of italian geometry , could now be attacked . \"",
    "zariski s paper @xcite is concerned with the following question : for a specified curve @xmath4 on an algebraic surface , what is the order of growth of @xmath9 as a function of @xmath10 ?",
    "his answer involved a decomposition : he showed that @xmath4 , considered as an element of a certain vector space , could be written as a sum @xmath11 of a `` positive part '' and a  negative part , \" so that the answer to his question was determined by @xmath12 alone .",
    "specifically , he showed that the order of growth was the `` self - intersection number '' of @xmath12 . in the heart of this paper",
    ", we will give an account of zariski s decomposition , assuming that we already have been given the relevant `` intersection theory '' on the surface . in the last section of the paper we will resume this account of the original context . in particular",
    "we will say something about how this intersection theory arises , and give a precise statement of zariski s formula on the order of growth .        .",
    "we now forget about the original context , and lay out an elementary theory within linear algebra .",
    "in section [ windup ] we will resume our account of the geometry which motivates the following definitions .",
    "suppose that @xmath13 is a vector space over @xmath14 ( the rational numbers ) equipped with a symmetric bilinear form ; we denote the product of @xmath15 and @xmath16 by @xmath17 .",
    "suppose furthermore that there is a basis @xmath18 with respect to which the bilinear form is an _ intersection product _ , meaning that the product of any two distinct basis elements is nonnegative .",
    "most of our examples will be finite - dimensional , but we are also interested in the infinite - dimensional case .",
    "if @xmath13 is finite - dimensional then we will assume that @xmath18 has an ordering , and using this ordered basis we will identify @xmath13 with @xmath19 ( where @xmath10 is its dimension ) ; a vector @xmath15 will be identified with its coordinate vector , written as a column .",
    "we can then specify the bilinear form by writing its associated symmetric matrix @xmath20 with respect to the basis , calling it the _ intersection matrix_. thus the product of @xmath15 and @xmath16 is @xmath21 , where @xmath22 denotes the transpose . with this interpretation",
    ", the form is an intersection product if and only if all off - diagonal entries of @xmath20 are nonnegative .    in any case , whether @xmath13 is finite- or infinite - dimensional , each element @xmath23 can be written in a unique way as a linear combination of a finite subset of the basis , with all coefficients nonzero .",
    "we will call this finite subset the _ support _ of @xmath15 , and the finite - dimensional subspace of @xmath13 which it spans is called the _ support space _ of @xmath15 .",
    "if all coefficients are positive , then @xmath15 is said to be _",
    "effective_. will be a linear combination of such curves .",
    "the combinations that use nonnegative coefficients may be interpreted geometrically , while the others are just `` virtual curves . '' ] in particular each basis element is effective , and the zero vector is also considered to be effective ( since we may sum over the empty set ) .    a vector @xmath16 is called _ nef with respect to _ @xmath13 if @xmath24 for every effective vector @xmath15 .",
    "note that to check whether a vector satisfies this condition it suffices to check whether its product with each basis element is nonnegative . in the finite - dimensional case ( using the identification of @xmath13 with @xmath19 , as described above ) the definition can be formulated in terms of the intersection matrix : since the entries of @xmath25 are the products of the basis elements with @xmath16 , we observe that a vector @xmath16 is nef with respect to @xmath13 precisely when @xmath25 is effective .",
    "in particular if @xmath20 is nonsingular , then @xmath16 is nef with respect to @xmath13 if and only if there is an effective vector @xmath23 for which @xmath26 .",
    "now suppose that @xmath27 is a subspace of @xmath13 spanned by some subset of the basis and containing the support space of a vector @xmath16 ( for example , @xmath27 could be the support space itself ) .",
    "if @xmath16 is nef with respect to @xmath13 then it is nef with respect to @xmath27 , but the opposite implication may not be correct .",
    "[ nefnotnef ] suppose that the intersection matrix is @xmath28,\\ ] ] and let @xmath27 be the one - dimensional subspace spanned by the first basis element @xmath29 .",
    "then @xmath30 is nef with respect to @xmath27 , but it is not nef with respect to @xmath13 .",
    "we do , however , have a partial converse .    if @xmath31 is effective and nef with respect to the subspace @xmath27 , then it is nef with respect to the entire space @xmath13 .    by hypothesis",
    ", the product of @xmath16 and a basis element for @xmath27 is nonnegative .",
    "since @xmath16 is effective , its intersection product with any other basis element of @xmath13 is likewise nonnegative .    in view of this lemma",
    ", we may simply call such a vector _ effective and nef_.    here is our main theorem .",
    "[ zdecomp ] for each effective element @xmath23 , there is a unique way to write it as a sum @xmath32 of elements satisfying the following conditions :    1 .",
    "@xmath33 is nef with respect to @xmath13 ; 2 .",

    "see  @xcite .",
    "we now resume our informal account of the original context in which zariski developed his theory of decomposition .",
    "figure [ twocubics ] shows two plane curves of degree three .",
    "the polynomial @xmath235 defining the curve on the right can be factored , with the visible result that the curve is the union of a line and a conic ( a curve of degree 2 ) ; we say that these are the _ components _ of the curve .",
    "the other curve has a single component : we call it _",
    "suppose that @xmath236 where each @xmath237 is an irreducible polynomial and thus defines an irreducible curve @xmath238 , one of the components of @xmath239 .",
    "we associate to @xmath239 the formal linear combination @xmath240 calling it the _ divisor _ of @xmath239 .",
    "note that all coefficients are nonnegative ; thus this is an _",
    "effective divisor_. for example , the divisor associated to the polynomial in ( [ reducible ] ) is @xmath241 , where @xmath242 is the conic and @xmath243 is the line . a similar recipe works for any other surface .",
    "for an effective divisor in the plane we define its _ degree _ to be the degree of the defining polynomial ; thus the degree of @xmath244 is @xmath245",
    ".    given two distinct irreducible curves @xmath246 and @xmath4 on an algebraic surface , they have an _ intersection number _ @xmath247 . intuitively , this is the number of points in which the curves intersect , and indeed in many cases that is its precise meaning , but to define this number carefully one needs to consider exotic possibilities , so that for example a tangency between the curves gets counted as  two points \" ( or even more ) .",
    "thus to an algebraic curve we can associate a matrix recording the intersection numbers of its components . in the plane , we mean the complex projective plane . ]",
    "the intersection number between curves of degrees @xmath248 and @xmath1 is @xmath249 , a fundamental result of tienne bzout dating to 1776 .",
    "hence for the curves in figure [ twocubics ] these matrices are @xmath250 \\qquad \\text{and } \\qquad \\left [ \\begin{array}{cc } 4 & 2 \\\\ 2 & 1 \\\\ \\end{array } \\right].\\ ] ]    for distinct irreducible curves , the intersection number is always a nonnegative integer .",
    "thus the off - diagonal entries in these matrices are nonnegative , and they are intersection matrices as defined in section [ decomp ] .",
    "the diagonal entries are _ self - intersection numbers_. in our example we have calculated them using bzout s formula , but on other algebraic surfaces one has the startling fact : a self - intersection number may be negative ! the simplest example of this comes from a process called _ blowing up _ , in which a given surface is modified by replacing one of its points @xmath251 by an entire curve @xmath18 having self - intersection number @xmath252 , called an",
    "_ exceptional curve_. ( this process is the basic operation of the `` birational geometry '' to which mumford alludes in the quotation in section [ origcontext ] . ) each irreducible curve @xmath246 on the original surface which contains @xmath251 can be `` lifted '' to a curve on the new surface meeting @xmath18 .",
    "we will abuse notation by referring to the lifted curve with the same letter @xmath246 , but a remarkable thing happens to @xmath253 : it is reduced in value ( typically by 1 ) . for example , if one blows up the plane at one of the two intersection points shown in figure [ twocubics ] , then the intersection matrix for the two original components and the new curve @xmath18 is as follows : @xmath254.\\ ] ] see figure [ blownup ] , noting that the two original components have been pulled apart , so that they now meet at just a single point .",
    "the definition of intersection number between a pair of irreducible curves extends by linearity to any pair of divisors ( effective or not ) .",
    "if one has the intersection matrix , then the calculation is simply a matrix multiplication .",
    "for example , the self - intersection of the divisor @xmath241 associated to the polynomial in ( [ reducible ] ) is @xmath255 \\left [ \\begin{array}{cc } 4 & 2 \\\\ 2 & 1 \\\\ \\end{array } \\right ] = \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ \\end{array } \\right ] = 9.\\ ] ] note that the result is the square of its degree .",
    "as we have observed , the matrix of intersection numbers for a set of irreducible curves on an algebraic surface is an intersection matrix .",
    "thus for any effective divisor @xmath4 we can compute a zariski decomposition , obtaining a positive and negative part .",
    "what zariski discovered in his fundamental paper @xcite is that the solution of the riemann - roch problem for @xmath4 was strongly controlled by its positive part .",
    "more precisely , letting @xmath12 denote the positive part , he showed that @xmath256 to illustrate this formula , we present two examples .",
    "let @xmath4 be an effective divisor of degree @xmath1 in the plane .",
    "the linear system @xmath7 consists of all effective divisors of degree @xmath8 , and thus has dimension @xmath257 . by bzout s theorem ,",
    "the intersection of @xmath4 with any irreducible curve is positive ; hence @xmath4 is nef , and thus its positive part is @xmath4 itself .",
    "zariski s formula ( [ zf ] ) says that @xmath258    ( this example is also treated in example  3.5 of @xcite . )",
    "blow up the plane at two points @xmath259 and @xmath260 , calling the exceptional curves @xmath261 and @xmath262 , and let @xmath263 denote the lift of the line through the two points .",
    "then the intersection matrix with respect to the ordered basis @xmath264 is @xmath265.\\ ] ] consider @xmath266 , where all coefficients are nonnegative .",
    "then there are five possibilities for the zariski decomposition : @xmath267 ( where we have always written the positive part first )",
    ".    we can give a description of the linear system @xmath5 in terms of plane curves , as follows : it consists of those curves @xmath0 for which the polynomial @xmath239 has degree @xmath268 and satisfies these conditions :      let us check this description against zariski s formula ( [ zf ] ) in the first and last of the five cases of ( [ 5cases ] ) ( the other cases being similar ) . in the first case , we are imposing @xmath271 conditions at the point @xmath259 , and @xmath272 conditions at @xmath260 .",
    "one can confirm that the two sets of conditions are independent , and thus the dimension of the linear system is @xmath273 similarly one has @xmath274 so that @xmath275    in the final case of ( [ 5cases ] ) , the conditions imposed at the two points are no longer independent .",
    "however one can show the following : each polynomial @xmath239 is divisible by @xmath276 , where @xmath277 is an equation of the line through @xmath259 and @xmath260 ; furthermore , the quotient @xmath278 has degree @xmath279 , with its partial derivatives of order less than @xmath280 vanishing at @xmath259 , and similarly its partial derivatives of order less than @xmath248 vanishing at @xmath260 ; these conditions are independent , and thus the dimension of the linear system is @xmath281 similarly @xmath282 so that @xmath283    zariski s ideas about decomposition of curves on an algebraic surface continue to resonate in contemporary developments .",
    "miles reid @xcite , for example , has written that `` zariski s paper on the asymptotic form of riemann - roch for a divisor on a surface forms a crucial bridge between the italian tradition of surfaces and modern work on 3-folds [ algebraic varieties of dimension 3 ] . ''",
