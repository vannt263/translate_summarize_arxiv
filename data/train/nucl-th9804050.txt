    "<S> the one- and two - step mechanisms of the @xmath0 reaction in the range of incident proton kinetic energy @xmath1 have been investigated for the first time . a remarkable peculiarity of the two - step mechanism which incorporates subprocesses @xmath2 and @xmath3 is the so called velocity matching providing the presence of all intermediate particles nearly to the on - mass - shell . </S>",
    "<S> the differential cross section has been calculated using a realistic model for the hypertritium @xmath4 wave function . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum value of the cross section is estimated as @xmath51nb / sr . </S>",
    "<S> the contribution of the one - step mechanism with the elementary process @xmath6 into the cross section has been found to be two - three orders of magnitude smaller in comparison with the two - step mechanism .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath7 meson production in proton - nucleus collisions is of great interest as these reactions allow one to investigate the nuclear structure at short distances between nucleons @xcite . while the experimental research programs @xcite are supposed for the target nuclei with @xmath8 the clearest theoretical analysis can be done for the lightest nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 reaction investigated here is a process with high momentum transfer . </S>",
    "<S> so , at the threshold of this reaction ( @xmath9 ) initial proton and deuteron have momenta @xmath5 1 gev / c in the c.m.s . </S>",
    "<S> but in the final state all nucleons are at rest . at the proton kinetic energy in the laboratory system @xmath10 below 1580 mev the @xmath11 process on a free nucleon n at rest </S>",
    "<S> is forbidden by the energy - momentum conservation . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the @xmath0 reaction in this region occurs either through involving high momentum components of the deuteron wave function when incident proton collides with one of its nucleons ( one - step mechanism , fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 [ fig1],_a _ ) or by means of active interaction with two nucleons of the deuteron ( two - step mechanism , fig.1,[fig1]_b _ ) . </S>",
    "<S> it seems less obvious that in the last case the high momentum components of the wave function will be required . in this respect </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 reaction is similar to @xmath12 @xcite and @xmath13 @xcite reactions for which the two - step mechanism ( called a three -body one in literature ) was found to dominate @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the @xmath14 and @xmath13 reactions have deeper analogy in the framework of the two - step mechanism with subprocesses @xmath15 and @xmath16 or @xmath17 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the relation between masses of initial and final particles in these reactions is such that at the corresponding threshold of the reaction as well as for the angles @xmath18 which determines the direction of the final meson momentum in respect to the incident beam , all intermediate particles ( @xmath19meson , deuteron , nucleon ) are near to on - mass - shell in a very wide energy range above the threshold @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason the two - step mechanism corresponding to the feynman graph in fig.1[fig1],_b _ seems to be the most realistic model of this reaction . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that for production of @xmath19mesons and heavier mesons ( @xmath20 ) as well as for target - nuclei with @xmath21 the above mentioned velocity matching does not take the place .    </S>",
    "<S> another interesting aspect of the @xmath0 reaction is connected with formation of the hypertritium nucleus @xmath22 in the final state . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath22 nucleus is a loosely bound system with the binding energy @xmath23 which probably has a configuration of the @xmath24 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an investigation of the @xmath0 reaction can give a new independent information about the wave function of the @xmath22 nucleus .    </S>",
    "<S> in the framework of the two - step mechanism the amplitude @xmath25 of the @xmath0 reaction can be written in the full analogy with the amplitude of the @xmath26 reaction @xcite . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , we get @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the amplitudes of the processes @xmath15 and @xmath30 respectively , @xmath31 is the nucleon mass , @xmath32 is the isotopic spin factor allowing for the summation over isotopic spin indices in the intermediate state ; the nuclear formfactor in exp . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 1 ] ) is defined as @xmath33    here @xmath34 is the wave function of the deuteron and @xmath35 is the wave function of the @xmath22 nucleus in the @xmath36-channel in momentum space ; @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the energy and momentum of the intermediate @xmath39 meson at zero momenta of nucleons in the nuclear vertices @xmath40 : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the energy of the jth particle in the c.m.s . , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the momenta in the initial deuteron and the @xmath22 nucleus in the c.m.s . respectively .    according to the paper @xcite , when deriving exp . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 2 ] ) we neglect zero components @xmath45 and @xmath46 of the 4-momenta @xmath47 and @xmath48 in the 4-dimensional propagator of @xmath19meson @xmath49 in comparison with the energies @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> the 3-momenta @xmath51 and @xmath52 are taken exactly . </S>",
    "<S> recently there has appeared a calculation @xcite for the @xmath53 reaction near the threshold in the two - step model which is very similar to that developed in paper @xcite and used here . </S>",
    "<S> the authors of paper @xcite apply the 3-dimensional diagram technique and instead of the 4-dimensional @xmath39meson propagator @xmath54 they deal with the energy denominator @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> the linearization procedure over fermi momenta @xmath51 and @xmath52 is used in order to perform integration over @xmath56 and @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> exp . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 2 ] ) for the nuclear formfactor differs from that in paper @xcite while in the both cases it is a rather smooth function of kinematic variables . </S>",
    "<S> it is obvious that the reasons for this difference are different means for consideration of relativistic effects in the two - step models @xcite and @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude ( [ 1 ] ) is connected to the differential cross section of the @xmath0 reaction by the following expression @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the invariant mass of the initial p+d state . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitudes @xmath60 and @xmath61 are related to the corresponding differential cross sections by analogous relations . </S>",
    "<S> one should note that the amplitudes @xmath28 and @xmath29 are factored outside the integral sign at the point @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> as mentioned in paper @xcite , factorisation of the @xmath63 cross section in the product of @xmath15 and @xmath64 cross sections takes place if only one of two invariant forward @xmath15 amplitudes dominates . for simplicity </S>",
    "<S> we assume here that this condition is fulfilled .    the amplitude of the one - step mechanism corresponding to the feynman graph in fig.1,[fig1 ] _ a _ can be written as @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the @xmath67 process amplitude which is factored outside the two - loop integration sign . </S>",
    "<S> the nuclear formfactor @xmath68 is defined by @xmath69 where @xmath70 one should note that integral ( [ 6 ] ) has a meaning of the deuteron elastic formfactor @xmath71 at the transferred momentum @xmath72 modified by the presence of the hypertritium wave function @xmath73 in the integrand . </S>",
    "<S> it is obvious that the formfactor @xmath74 decreases fast with growing @xmath75 .    </S>",
    "<S> the one - step amplitude has been numericaly calculated here using both @xmath76 and @xmath77components of the deuteron wave function for the rsc potential in parametrisation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> using the experimental data on the total cross section @xmath78 @xcite we estimated here the squared amplitude @xmath79 as @xmath80 in the initial proton energy range @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical calculations for the two - step mechanism are performed in the s - wave approximation for the deuteron wave function @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( as was shown by our calculations , the contribution of the deuteron d - component to the cross section is about 10 % ) . </S>",
    "<S> for the wave function of the @xmath22 nucleus the @xmath82-model developed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite on the basis of separable @xmath83interaction is used . in this model the @xmath22 wave function only contains the s - component . in the s - wave approximation the factor ( [ 2 ] ) takes the form @xmath84 for the differential cross section of the reaction @xmath15 the parametrisation of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite is used here . for the @xmath16 differential cross section the parametrisation of the total cross section from ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite is used and isotropic behaviour of the cross section is assumed .    </S>",
    "<S> we have investigated here numericaly the behaviour of the formfactor @xmath85 as a function of incident proton kinetic energy @xmath10 at different @xmath7-meson scattering angles @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> the momentum @xmath87 is a rather fast decreasing function of @xmath10 at @xmath88 ( @xmath89 in the range @xmath90 ) . on the contrary , at the scattering angles @xmath91 and @xmath92 both the energy @xmath37 and momentum @xmath87 are increasing functions of @xmath10 ( @xmath93 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this behaviour of @xmath87 results in a large value of the formfactor @xmath94 at @xmath88 in comparison to the ones at @xmath91 and @xmath95 . if one substitutes the wave function of the @xmath96 nucleus in the @xmath97 channel @xcite instead of the @xmath22 hypernucleus in exp . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 8 ] ) then the squared formfactor @xmath94 corresponds to the one for the @xmath98 reaction and it turns out to decrease faster with growing incident energy @xmath10 and its value at the threshold increases by a factor of 3 - 5 .    </S>",
    "<S> the calculated differential cross sections of the @xmath0 reaction are presented in fig.2 [ fig3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> one can see from this picture that for any scattering angle the differential cross section has a sharp maximum at the proton energy @xmath99 , which displays the corresponding sharp peak observed in the total cross section of the @xmath100 reaction ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) . on the whole , the relations between differential cross sections at the angles @xmath101 and @xmath102 follow from corresponding relations between formfactors @xmath94 .    </S>",
    "<S> the differential cross section of the @xmath0 reaction predicted by the two - step model differs from that for the @xmath98 reaction in two respects @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> first , the maximum value of the @xmath7-meson production cross section @xmath103 is about 50 times smaller than that for the @xmath104meson production . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , the @xmath0 reaction cross section is a smoother decreasing function of incident proton energy in comparison with the cross section of the @xmath98 reaction . as follows from the behaviour of the formfactor @xmath94 both these peculiarities </S>",
    "<S> are in part connected to the form of the wave function of the @xmath22 nucleus .    </S>",
    "<S> the results of calculation in the framework of the one - step mechanism are presented in fig.3 [ fig5 ] . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that the contribution of this mechanism is two - three orders of magnitude smaller than that following from the two - step model .    in conclusion , we note that the two - step mechanism of the @xmath105 reaction is used owing to the velocity matching . in the case of @xmath104meson production </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism explains qualitatively the energy dependence of the cross section above the threshold @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , just at the threshold this model is in strong contradiction with the experimental data on the @xmath98 reaction @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one of a reason for it is probably a strong attractive interaction in the final @xmath106 state caused by an excitation of the nucleon @xmath107 resonance @xcite . at present </S>",
    "<S> there are no experimental data pointing to the presence of strong coupling of the @xmath108meson to any nucleon resonance in the resonance mass region of @xmath109 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore one can suppose that final state interaction in the @xmath0 reaction will not be of great importance in contrast to the @xmath104production .    </S>",
