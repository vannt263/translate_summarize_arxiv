    "<S> the ribbon can be tuned into the transport gap by applying gate voltages . </S>",
    "<S> multiple sites of localized charge leading to coulomb blockade are observed in agreement with previous experiments . due to the strong capacitive coupling between the ribbon and the graphene top layer sheet , the evolution of the coulomb blockade peaks in gate voltages </S>",
    "<S> can be used to obtain the local density of states and therefore the quantum capacitance of the graphene top layer . </S>",
    "<S> spatially varying density and doping are found which are attributed to a spatial variation of the dielectric due to fabrication imperfections .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the advantages of layered materials such as graphene , hexagonal boron nitride ( hbn ) or various dichalcogenides , is the possibility to fabricate stacks in order to obtain a heterostructure material with new properties . </S>",
    "<S> this was recently exploited to fabricate a variety of different device structures  @xcite and to investigate a number of novel effects : localization in super clean systems  @xcite , current drag  @xcite and the emergence of superlattices  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> most of these experiments were performed with so - called `` double - layer graphene '' , consisting of two graphene layers separated by a thin insulator layer . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to bernal - stacked bilayer graphene , charge transfer between the two layers is not possible .    above experiments </S>",
    "<S> were conducted with micron - sized graphene sheets . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we develop this idea one step further : we pattern the lower graphene sheet laterally into a nanoribbon ( e.g. refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) and stack an insulator plus a micron - sized graphene sheet on top . </S>",
    "<S> this experiment is a crucial step towards fabricating and understanding stacked graphene nanostructures . </S>",
    "<S> if the nanoribbon is tuned into the so - called transport gap  @xcite , coulomb blockade can be observed  @xcite . the localized charge in the ribbon serves as a sensitive and local detector for its electrostatic surrounding and allows us to probe properties of the graphene top layer . </S>",
    "<S> this is conceptually similar to an set above a 2deg  @xcite and scanning set measurements  @xcite . despite using a comparably thick insulator layer ( @xmath0 ) </S>",
    "<S> , we can still reach the regime where the spacing between the layers is smaller than the average distance between two charge carriers within one layer  @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> the derivative along @xmath6 is more complex as shown in c : the line along which the derivative changes sign ( yellow line )  i.e. the position of the charge - neutrality point of the top layer covering the ribbon layer  is not straight but bent . </S>",

    "<S> the average charge carrier density in the ribbon layer approaches zero and screening of the back - gate is reduced . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the position of the charge neutrality point of the top layer ( yellow line ) , the outer two dashed lines mark the boundaries of the approximate region where electron - hole puddles are expected in the graphene top layer due to disorder originating from fabrication . </S>",
    "<S> these values are extracted at a constant @xmath5 . for sufficiently high density in the ribbon layer , </S>",
    "<S> values of @xmath8 are found for the top layer independently of the chosen @xmath5  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the capacitances are calculated based on a parallel plate capacitor model ( with @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) . for both layers , </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of the dirac point in @xmath5 and @xmath6 is generally well predicted - despite the simplification of the parallel plate capacitor model which is , strictly speaking , not valid for the ribbon itself . </S>",

    "<S> next , the transport regime of suppressed conductance in the ribbon is investigated ( so - called `` transport gap '' ) . figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ribbonwithtopgate : sgvssg]a , b show the current flowing through the ribbon as a function of @xmath5 and bias voltage for two different values of @xmath6 . in agreement with previous work , partially overlapping coulomb blockade diamonds </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : ribbonwithtopgate : sgvssg]c , d show the current at fixed bias flowing through the ribbon in the right transport gap as a function of the applied side gate voltages ( fixed @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> while details vary , predominantly slopes of -1 are found indicating that the localized charges are equally well coupled to both side gates and therefore likely located in the ribbon . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , other slopes are found indicating states that are not positioned symmetric relative to the ribbon axis and might be localized along the edges  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the observation of avoided crossings between different resonances indicates strong capacitive coupling between different sites of localized charge  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> no significant difference is found when comparing transport in the right transport gap for different densities in the top layer ( compare figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ribbonwithtopgate : sgvssg]a , b and figs .  [ fig : ribbonwithtopgate : sgvssg]c , d ) . </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of the left transport gap is qualitatively similar to the right transport gap but current is generally less suppressed and the coulomb blockade diamonds are smaller .    in the following </S>",
    "<S> , the evolution of the coulomb resonances as a function of @xmath5 and @xmath6 is investigated as shown in a. in order to enhance the visibility of the features , the axes were transformed ( details see figure caption ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is instructive to interpret the bending of the lines as the influence of the quantum capacitance rather than screening ( both interpretations are equivalent ) . </S>",
    "<S> can be rewritten using the definition of the quantum capacitance @xmath23  @xcite : @xmath24 the slope of features of constant density in the ribbon layer ( @xmath25 ) yields direct information about the quantum capacitance of the top layer ( @xmath26 ) . as coulomb resonances in the ribbon mark the position where one electron is added to the ribbon , they are used to extract such slopes as shown in b. c shows the value of the slopes as a function of gate voltages . </S>",
    "<S> it is difficult to exactly track the resonances due to avoided crossings between different resonances lead to small wiggles in the extracted slopes . </S>",
    "<S> there are at least 3 sets of slopes that are marked in different colors . due to the localization of charge carriers in the ribbon , </S>",
    "<S> the coulomb resonances are a local sensor for the electronic properties of the top layer . </S>",
    "<S> also note that are generic and do not contain graphene specific terms .    </S>",
    "<S> we now use the evolution of the coulomb blockade resonances to obtain information on the local quantum capacitance of the top layer . in the limit of high top layer density ( left side of c , saturation of slope ) , </S>",
    "<S> the quantum capacitance is negligible and the slope is given by @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> we find a different saturation value of @xmath28 for different sets of lines . while it is possible that different sites of localized charge experience a different capacitance ratio due to geometry , we believe it to be more likely that the observed differences originate from a local change in @xmath29 due to fabrication residues that locally increase the thickness of the dielectric .    aside from a different saturation value , the different curves are shifted horizontally , indicating a different local doping of the top layer graphene that is probed by the localized state in the ribbon . </S>",
    "<S> the shift between the three different sets of lines can be explained by different induced densities due to the different local capacitances together with an nonzero intrinsic doping of the top layer graphene .    </S>",
    "<S> as found in previous experiments , localized states can slightly change their spatial position when an additional electron is added or when the electrostatic environment is changed  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the deviations within one set of lines can therefore be explained by slightly different areas of the top layer that are probed by the localized states in the ribbon .    in d , the extracted slopes are converted into a local quantum capacitance of the top layer using and different hbn thicknesses based on the saturation value of the slope . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum capacitance is converted into a local charge carrier density using and by shifting the magenta curves by @xmath30 to the left as shown in e ( the yellow lines are not shown for clarity ) . the thick brown line ( @xmath31 ) </S>",
    "<S> is calculated using together with the assumption that the middle layer is at zero density .    generally , the lines extracted from the measurement fit well to the expected values . </S>",
    "<S> the blue lines have a much wider spread around the theoretical value than the red lines . </S>",
    "<S> this is compatible with the model of a spatially changing capacitance between the ribbon and the top layer due to fabrication residues : the red lines correspond to areas that are mostly flat , whereas the blue lines correspond to areas with residues . </S>",
    "<S> as the areas on which the charges are localized in the ribbon are likely larger than the typical area of fabrication residues  @xcite , spatial averaging of the capacitance occurs . </S>",
    "<S> this is compatible with the fact that the extracted value from the measurement ( @xmath32 ) is smaller than the value from the sfm scan ( @xmath33 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the shift of the magenta lines indicates a local difference in doping .    in order to estimate in which regime </S>",
    "<S> this local change of capacitance is important , are used to calculate the difference in density ( @xmath34 ) if the thickness of the hbn flake is varied locally by @xmath35 as shown in f. due to the plate capacitor geometry , @xmath34 is equally large for both ribbon and top layer . </S>",
    "<S> as soon as the brown lines are crossed ( @xmath36 ) , the effect of varying dielectric thickness starts to dominate over the intrinsic doping fluctuations due to fabrication residues . </S>",
    "<S> these conclusions are important , for example , for double - gated bilayer graphene devices where a high top - gate voltage is applied in order to open a bandgap  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> choosing a thick dielectric together with as clean interfaces as possible mitigates these layer thickness fluctuations .    </S>",
    "<S> finally it is possible to extract the average quantum capacitance of the ribbon layer using the data from a together with and tracking the position of the dirac point in the top layer . </S>",
    "<S> the extracted density as a function of the gate voltages fits reasonably well to the expectations and a disorder density @xmath37 is obtained for the ribbon layer .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> we have investigated electrical transport through a graphene nanoribbon and a strongly capacitively coupled graphene top layer . as this experiment is a crucial step towards stacked  and therefore strongly coupled  </S>",
    "<S> graphene nanostructures , it is important to understand transport in this system in detail . </S>",
    "<S> we showed that the mutual interactions can be discussed in terms of screening or , equivalently , quantum capacitance . in agreement with previous studies , </S>",
    "<S> transport through the nanoribbon was governed by coulomb blockade in the regime of low density . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of single coulomb blockade peaks was tracked as a function of voltages applied to the back gate and the top layer graphene . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown that the position of the coulomb resonances in gate voltage space is directly related to the quantum capacitance and therefore , the density of the top layer graphene sheet . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed analysis of the different extracted coulomb peak positions showed different geometrical capacitances per unit area between localized charges in the ribbon and the top layer graphene . </S>",
    "<S> this behaviour can be explained with fabrication residues changing the thickness of the dielectric locally . </S>",
    "<S> these findings show experimentally that it is crucial for stacked graphene devices to have interfaces that are as clean as possible . </S>",
    "<S> small variations in dielectric thickness can quickly become more important to transport than the intrinsic electron - hole puddles originating from nonzero chemical doping of the devices . </S>",
    "<S> finally , it is worth noting that charge localization inside the graphene nanoribbon is not influenced strongly by the density of the top layer graphene , except for the mentioned evolution in gate voltage . </S>"
