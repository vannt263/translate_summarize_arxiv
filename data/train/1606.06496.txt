    "since many years quantum theory and general relativity have passed all tests .",
    "nevertheless the unification of both theories is still an open task .",
    "one interesting development in this case is the in late 1997 discovered ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "therefore , a conformal field theory ( cft ) acting on the boundary of an anti - de - sitter ( ads ) space is dual to a string theory with ads background .",
    "analyzing the structure of black holes in such a background could give insights on unsolved problems of the corresponding cft .",
    "another unsolved question is the problem of dark matter and dark energy , which possibly can be solved by introducing ( pseudo-)scalar fields such as dilatons and axions @xcite .",
    "one interesting spacetime containing both fields and a negative cosmological constant is the dyonic rotating black hole with four electromagnetic charges of the @xmath0 gauged supergravity found by chow and compre @xcite .",

    "with pairwise equal charges and vanishing nut - charge , we obtain the kerr - newman - ads black hole and the ungauged solution is similar to the einstein - maxwell - dilaton - axion ( emda ) black hole @xcite .    to understand the properties of a spacetime it is mandatory to study the geodesic behaviour of test particles and light and solve the equations of motion .",
    "in this article we derive these equations by separating the hamilton - jacobi equation , which separability can be shown by constructing killing tensors @xcite .",

    "the solutions can be stated in terms of derivatives of the kleinian @xmath1-functions and were used to solve the geodesic equations in the four dimensional schwarzschild - de sitter @xcite and in various higher dimensional spacetimes like the schwarzschild ( -anti de sitter ) and reissner - nordstrm - solution @xcite .",

    "now we can use the analytical solutions to visualize the possible orbits in this spacetime . in fig . [",
    "pic : orbits-1 ] examples of a bound orbit , an escape orbit and a many - world bound orbit are shown .",
    "[ pic : orbits-1](a ) shows the special case of a zoom - whirl orbit , where the particle makes several turns near the horizon , then escapes to a region far away of the black hole and turns back to the near horizon regime .",
    "figure [ pic : orbits-2](a ) shows a bo which lies inside the singularity .",
    "we cut out a part of the ringoid structure to make it visible .",
    "the orbit in fig [ pic : orbits-2](b ) shows an escape orbit around a naked singularity for negative @xmath48 .",
    "the singularity has a toroidal form and it may be possible to fly through the hole in the middle . the last orbit in fig [ pic : orbits-2](c )",
    "shows a two - world escape orbit , where the turning point is very close to the inner horizon .",
    "the singularity for this black hole is an ellipsoid .",
    "in this paper we derived the equations of motion for test particles and light in the @xmath0 dyonic rotating black hole spacetime and stated their analytical solution in two cases .",
    "for the full solution we had to use methods for solving hyperelliptic differential equations of the first and third kind .",
    "for vanishing cosmological constant or light the solution can be formulated in an easier form , since we only had to solve elliptic differential equations .",
    "we were able to characterize the possible orbit types for two - horizon black holes .",
    "these were orbits we already know from the special cases of the spacetime like escape orbits and bound orbits . a special feature are bound orbits and many - world bound orbits , which crosses @xmath84 .",
    "we call these cbo or cmbo .",
    "in addition we found an interesting structure of the singularity varying from toruslike structures to ellipsoids for @xmath176 in contrast to the emda black hole @xmath177 .",
    "future work could be the characterization of geodesic motion for black holes with more than two horizons , especially the influence of the virtual horizon on the particle motion .",
    "another step is to derive the equations of motion for charged particles or to consider an even more general black hole with more charges . in these cases",
    "the differential equation we have to deal with are at least hyperelliptic of higher genus or even only solvable in special cases .",
    "the analytical solutions we derived can now be used to calculate observables like the periastron shift , the light deflection or the shadow of the black hole , which eventually can be compared to observations in the future .",
