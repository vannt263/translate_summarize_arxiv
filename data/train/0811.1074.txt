    "the sunspot is one of the most prominent structures in the solar photosphere , although there are many related unsolved problems remaining even today",
    ". one of them is the source of energy transport in sunspots .",
    "it is known that the radiative energy alone is not sufficient for accounting for the observed brightness of sunspots , so another form of convective energy transport is necessary ( deinzer 1965 ) .",
    "the study of umbral dots ( uds ) , which are tiny bright points in the umbra , are essential for understanding the energy transport in sunspots , since uds are considered to be a manifestation of the convection .",
    "parker ( 1979 ) suggested in his `` spaghetti '' model , that uds are the radiative signatures of the top parts of field - free convective plumes .",
    "the field - free plumes intrude from below the visible surface into a gap between magnetic bundles in a cluster - type sunspot .",
    "these plumes are accompanied by smaller magnetic field strength , substantial upflows within uds , and a cusp - shaped magnetic structure ( spruit & scharmer 2006 ) .",
    "another promising mechanism is the magneto - convection in a monolithic sunspot .",
    "the monolithic model considers a sunspot as the aggregation of uniform vertically thin columns , and uds as a natural result of the overstable oscillatory convection , which is a preferred mode just below the photosphere ( weiss et al .",
    "2002 ; sch@xmath4ssler & v@xmath5gler 2006 ) .",
    "the monolithic model predicts smaller field strength , upflows in the center of uds in addition to downflows at their boundaries , and a cusp - like structure .",

    "the schematic view of an ud that accounts for the center - to - limb variation of magnetic and velocity fields is shown in figure [ fig : udmodel ] .",

    "when we observe an ud far from disk center , the line formation height is higher than the ud occurring site .",
    "the observation supports this interpretation because we could not find large differences between uds and their bg on march 4 .",
    "our results directly support the model that the uds are formed at deep photosphere , and have a cusp - shaped magnetic field . as for the downflows showed by red arrows in figure [ fig : udmodel ] ,",
    "the discussion is made in  5.3 .",
    "there is a possibility that this center - to - limb variation is due to the evolutional phase difference of uds in a decaying sunspot .",
    "no one has examined the change of ud characteristics in a developing , mature , and decaying sunspot as far as we know . of course",
    ", the actual cause of this variation can be the mixture of the two , that is , the formation height difference and the evolutional phase difference .      as stated in  4.1 ,",
    "the filling factor is computed as 1@xmath13(stray - light fraction ) . in our inversion , the stray - light profile is the averaged stokes _",
    "i _ profile over the regions where the maximum polarization degree along the line profile is larger than 0.2% .",
    "according to the limb observation of sp performed on march 16 , 2007 , the fraction of the scattered light in the continuum wavelength was 2% at a few arcsec away from the limb . on the other hand ,",
    "the average stray - light fraction inside the umbra was @xmath010% .",
    "thus the observed profile is considered to be composed of three components : unpolarized light due to telescope diffraction ( @xmath02% ) , unpolarized light coming from the field - free atmosphere in the umbra , and polarized light coming from the magnetized gas .",
    "the filling factor indicates the fraction of the polarized light .",
    "assume that uds are the penetration of field - free hot gas ( socas - navarro et al .",
    "2004 ; spruit & scharmer 2006 ) and the penetration reaches the formation height of fe i 6302 , the detection of small filling factor on uds are predicted .",
    "however , we could not find a decrease of the filling factor on uds ( table 1 and fig .",
    "[ fig : cpfill ] ) .",
    "higher resolution observation is strongly needed for further discussion .",
    "a three dimensional simulation of ud phenomena was recently done by sch@xmath4ssler & v@xmath5gler ( 2006 ) .",
    "they explained uds as a natural result of convection in a strong , initially monolithic magnetic field . in their simulation ,",
    "most of the uds had an elongated form with a central or threefold dark lane which separates the ud into two or three parts . at",
    "the end points of the dark lane there exist downflow patches .",
    "this picture is rather different from our observational impression .",
    "we observed almost circular uds and no dark lanes inside them with fe i continuum map .",
    "this is also the case with the blue / green continuum images obtained with _",
    "sot with spatial resolution ( kitai et al . 2007 ) .",
    "however in recent days there has ever some evidence of dark lanes with high resolution data , for example , bharti et al .",
    "( 2007b ) with g - band filtergrams using",
    "_ hinode _ sot .",
    "thus far no one , including us , has succeeded in finding localized downflow patches at the end points of dark lanes ( see fig . 1 in sch@xmath4ssler & v@xmath5gler 2006 )",
    ". there are two possibilities why we could not find localized downflow patches : one is that , the downflow patches may be too small to be detected with _ hinode _ s resolution limit .",
    "the other may be , because the continuum intensity ( i.e. , temperature ) goes down when the gas flows downward , and the signal of the stokes profile becomes too faint to be detected .",
    "we found another important phenomenon of uds .",
    "it is already known empirically that some uds occur and recur at the same location ( rimmele 1997 ) . with _",
    "hinode _ s seeing - free condition , we got the light curve of successive uds for about 3 hours using green continuum data .",
    "some uds located in the center part of the umbra showed oscillatory light curves .",
    "one example is shown in figure [ fig : periplot ] .",
    "the characteristic period of the oscillation is @xmath010 minutes , and the successive emergence of uds continues over @xmath050 minutes .",
    "this intensity oscillation may be supporting evidence for the monolithic model , because this model indicates that oscillatory convection is the preferred mode in the first few mm depth below the umbral photosphere by linear stability analysis ( weiss et al .",
    "+        another plausible model of uds is the field - free intrusion model .",
    "this model was proposed by parker ( 1979 ) , in which he discussed that the magnetic field lines beneath the umbra are divided into many separate flux tube bundles , like `` spaghetti '' .",
    "the uds would be a manifestation of field - free hot gas intrusion from below through the gaps of nonuniform magnetic field .",
    "a numerical study of the field - free intrusion model was done by spruit & scharmer ( 2006 ) for penumbral grains and an observational study was done by rimmele ( 2008 ) .",
    "they predict cusp - shaped magnetic field lines , smaller magnetic field , and upflow within the cusp .",
    "these characteristics of uds are almost the same as those of the monolithic model , apart from the localized downflow patches . field - free intrusion model also predicts downflow based on radiative cooling , but it s not concentrated on localized patches . the weak correlation between dark uds and downward motion , shown in figure [ fig : cpfill ] may be evidence for downflow by radiative cooling . as for the oscillatory light curve ( fig .",
    "[ fig : periplot ] ) , however , the field - free intrusion model fails to predict such oscillation .",
    "it would be very helpful if a future numerical simulation can make clear the possibility of brightness oscillation in the field - free hot gas surrounded by strong umbral magnetic field .    as was discussed in this paper",
    ", the oscillatory brightening of uds seems to be a key phenomenon to reach a conclusion on the origin of uds .",
    "detailed numerical studies and higher resolution observational , including the spectroscopic study of its temporal evolution on this phenomenon , are strongly needed in the near future .",
    "+ we are certain that we found many meaningful observational properties of magnetic field around uds .",
    "the reason why we succeed in deriving good correlations between uds and the components of magnetic field , owes greatly to the really stable , sensitive , and high - resolutional observation performed by spectro - polarimetry on board of the _ hinode _ solar optical telescope .",
    "hinode is a japanese mission developed and launched by isas / jaxa , with naoj as domestic partner and nasa and stfc ( uk ) as international partners .",
    "it is operated by these agencies in co - operation with esa and nsc ( norway ) .",
