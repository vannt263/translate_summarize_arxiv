    "in recent years it has repeatedly been shown that the solar photosphere responds to the abrupt coronal reconfiguration of most major flares , often with abrupt , coherent , permanent , and widely distributed patterns of photospheric magnetic field change .",
    "flare - related photospheric magnetic field changes were sought for many years ( _ e.g. _ , severny ,  1964 ; zirin and tanaka ,  1981 ) , before abrupt , permanent photospheric field changes were successfully observationally linked to flares ; see the discussion in sudol and harvey  ( 2005 ) . since the launch of nasa s _ solar dynamics observatory _",
    "( sdo ) satellite ( pesnell _ et al . _ ,  2012 ) , the _ helioseismic and magnetic imager _ ( hmi ) instrument ( schou _ et al . _ ,  2011 ) has provided full - disk vector magnetograms with @xmath3 pixels every 12 min , enabling the study of flare - related photospheric vector magnetic field changes in more detail than was possible previously .",
    "the history of flare - related photospheric magnetic field changes has not been straightforward . following the groundbreaking work of wang _",
    "et al . _",
    "( 1992 , 1994 ) , reporting abrupt , permanent field changes in flaring active regions , a number of later studies produced inconclusive results ; see the discussion in wang  ( 2006 ) . then , the introduction of high - cadence longitudinal ( line - of - sight ) photospheric magnetic field measurements , from nasa s _ michelson doppler imager _ ( mdi ) on the _ solar and heliospheric observatory _ ( soho ) satellite and the national solar observatory s _ global oscillations network group _ ( gong ) ground - based network , resulted in mounting evidence of flare - related magnetic changes in the photosphere .",
    "based on one - min mdi longitudinal data , kosovichev and zharkova  ( 1999 , 2001 ) reported sudden and permanent decreases in magnetic flux near x - class flares near magnetic neutral lines , and zharkova _ et al . _  ( 2005 ) found a permanent and significant increase in magnetic flux near the neutral line of a region during another x - class flare observed near the limb .",
    "using one - min gong longitudinal magnetograms , sudol and harvey  ( 2005 ) characterized the spatial distribution , strength , and rate of change of permanent field changes associated with 15 x - class flares . by carefully co - registering the images they succeeded in tracing the field changes pixel - by - pixel and were able to show the spatial structure of the changes .",
    "they concluded that the majority of field changes occurred close to or within sunspots .",
    "wang  ( 2006 ) found an unshearing movement parallel to the neutral lines in flare - related longitudinal magnetic field changes in the mdi data for all five @xmath4-spot flares that he studied , implying an overall release of shear , but that the two polarities converged toward the neutral line during some events and diverged during others .",
    "petrie and sudol  ( 2010 ) analyzed 1-min gong longitudinal magnetograms covering 77 flares of goes class at least m5 and , exploring the relationship between increasing / decreasing longitudinal fields and azimuth and tilt angles at various positions on the disk , found that the overall distributions of longitudinal increases and decreases at different parts of the disk was found to be consistent with the coronal implosion interpretation ( hudson ,  2000 ; hudson , fisher , and welsch ,  2008 ; fisher _ et al .",
    "_ ,  2012 ) where , after a coronal magnetic eruption , the remaining coronal field loop structure contracts downward resulting in a more horizontal photospheric field .",
    "wang and liu  ( 2010 ) studied 11 x - class flares using vector magnetograms from the vector magnetograph of big bear solar observatory and other vector magnetographs , and found in each case an increase of transverse field at the main polarity - inversion line .",
    "the launch of sdo and the release of 12-min hmi photospheric vector magnetograms prompted many authors to study flare - related photospheric vector field changes .",

    "et al . _  ( 2012 ) and petrie  ( 2012 , 2013 ) analyzed the 12-min hmi vector data for the 15 february 2011 x2.2 flare using different methods , and again found an increase of transverse field at the polarity - inversion line , as did liu _",
    "et al . _  ( 2012 ) for the 13 february 2011 m6.6 flare .",
    "these observations support hudson , fisher , and welsch s  ( 2008 ) loop - collapse scenario .",
    "hudson , fisher , and welsch  ( 2008 ) and fisher _ et al .",
    "_  ( 2012 ) developed a method for estimating the lorentz force change acting on the photosphere from the atmosphere above using the changes in the photospheric vector field observed during ( or shortly before and after ) the flare .",
    "the lorentz force is estimated by integrating components of the maxwell stress tensor across the boundary of a large domain containing the active region ( see figure  1 of fisher _ et al .",
    "_ ,  2012 ) .",
    "the bottom boundary of the domain is identified with the photospheric layer from which the observations derive , and the field values on this boundary are represented by the photospheric magnetic field observations . because the field values at the lateral and top boundaries of the domain are not measured , fisher _ et al .",
    "_  ( 2012 ) advocated applying their method only to domains where these boundaries are far enough away from the region that the fields crossing them are too weak to contribute significantly to the integral , allowing one to ignore them .",
    "strict adherence to this approach eliminates the possibility of studying the diverse responses of distinct components of an active region , such as sunspots and neutral - line arcades , whose behavior may provide important clues regarding the physics of the flare . because of this , some authors have proceeded to apply fisher _ et al . _",
    "s  ( 2012 ) equations to subdomains within active regions ( _ e.g. _ , wang _ et al .",
    "_ ,  2012 ; petrie ,  2012 , 2013 ) , sometimes providing brief arguments in favor of doing so ( alvarado - gmez _ et al .",
    "_ ,  2012 ; petrie ,  2013 ) .",
    "in particular , it has been argued that the force - free nature of the coronal magnetic field allows one to neglect most of the contribution from the lateral and top boundaries of such a domain . in this paper we will revisit this problem using a model for the stratified solar atmospheric field .",
    "when the 12-min hmi vector data became available it became possible to apply fisher _ et al . _",
    "s  ( 2012 ) surface integrals for the photospheric lorentz force , and it is noteworthy that these calculations have produced strikingly consistent results .",
    "et al . _  ( 2012 ) found that the vertical lorentz force changes associated with 18 major flares were generally directed downward near neutral lines and were correlated with peak soft x - ray flux .",
    "petrie  ( 2012 ) studied abrupt changes in both the photospheric magnetic and lorentz force vector associated with six major neutral - line flares using hmi vector data . during all six flares the neutral - line field vectors became stronger and more horizontal , in each case almost entirely due to strengthening of the horizontal field components parallel to the neutral line . in all cases",
    "the neutral - line pre - flare fields were less tilted than the reference potential fields , and collapsed abruptly and permanently closer to potential - field tilt angles , implying that the relaxation of magnetic stress played a leading role in creating the magnetic changes .",
    "indeed , the vertical lorentz force had a large , abrupt , permanent downward change at the main neutral line during each of the flares , consistent with loop collapse .",
    "the horizontal lorentz force changes acted mostly parallel to the neutral line in opposite directions on each side , a signature of the fields contracting during this loop collapse , pulling the two sides of the neutral line toward each other .",
    "the greater effect of the flares on field tilt than on shear may be explained by photospheric line - tying , since shear can not be removed during loop collapse without the foot - points moving across the photosphere .",
    "petrie  ( 2013 ) found that , in the case of the 15 february 2011 x2.2 flare , the oppositely - directed horizontal lorentz force changes acting on each side of neutral line were accompanied by abrupt torsional un - twisting forces in the two sunspots at each end of the neutral line .    while these studies exploited fisher",

    "s ( 2012 ) equations to offer more physical insight into the flare - related magnetic changes than the magnetic vector information alone , it remained true that fisher _ et al .",
    "_  ( 2012 ) did not advocate applying their method to fields within active regions and that a detailed defense was lacking .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate whether and under what circumstances lorentz force estimates within active regions can be reliably produced using this method . in this paper",
    "we revisit fisher _ et al . _",
    "s calculation in the context of gary s  ( 2001 ) well - known model for the plasma @xmath5 ( the ratio between the plasma and magnetic pressures ) of an active region .",

    "s  ( 2012 ) equations  ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) because we are considering the forces imposed on the photosphere from above instead of the equal and opposite forces on the atmosphere from below ( fisher _ et al .",
    "_ ,  2012 )",
    ".    if one sets the total lorentz - force to zero , the above surface integrals yield well - known expressions for the lorentz force on the photosphere ( molodensky ,  1974 ) that have been used to derive conditions for the force - freeness of measured photospheric magnetic vector fields ( low ,  1985 ) .",
    "these expressions have also been used to compare the forces of measured fields in the low solar satmosphere using photospheric and chromospheric vector magnetograms ( metcalf _ et al . _ , 1995 ) .",
    "now , assuming that the photospheric vector field is observed over a photospheric area @xmath15 at two times , @xmath20 before the flare - related field changes begin , and @xmath21 after the main field changes have occurred , the corresponding changes in the lorentz force vector components between these two times are given by equations  ( 17 ) and ( 18 ) of fisher _ et al .",

    "in equation  ( [ eq : gaussdiv ] ) , @xmath28 comprises the photospheric boundary @xmath29 plus the lateral boundaries @xmath30 and the top boundary @xmath31 .",
    "we now consider the case of a regular sub - domain within the active region with lower boundary at the photosphere . according to equation  ( [ eq : gaussdiv ] ) the contribution to the lorentz force vector components from a rectangular photospheric sub - domain of horizontal dimensions",
    "@xmath32 has typical size ,    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the height of the photospheric layer from where the observations derive , and @xmath35 is a typical field strength at that height .",
    "here we have represented the maxwell stress tensor components in equation  ( [ eq : maxwelltensor ] ) by the magnetic pressure alone for simplicity .",
    "this approximation neglects the effects of magnetic tension but is likely to give a useful description of the force distribution because both the magnetic pressure and tension forces are proportional to the square of the field strength .    unlike the photospheric boundary",
    ", the lateral boundaries extend to great heights .",
    "on the other hand , recall that for a force - free field the components of the maxwell stress tensor equation  ( [ eq : maxwelltensor ] ) integrate to zero ( molodensky ,  1974 ; low ,  1985 ) . above a certain height @xmath36 in the atmosphere",
    "we expect the magnetic field to be close enough to a force - free state , or to be weak enough , that its contribution to equation  ( [ eq : gaussdiv ] ) is negligible compared to the contribution from the fields below @xmath36 . here",
    "we will assume that this is true , and we will test this assumption in section  [ sect : lfintegral ] using models for the stratification of the field .    for simplicity",
    "we confine our attention to large , coherent magnetic structures where the field components @xmath37 vary over a length scale @xmath38 such that    @xmath39    in this case the difference between the lorentz forces at the two lateral boundaries at @xmath40 and @xmath41 at height @xmath42 has typical size    @xmath43    where @xmath44 is a typical field strength at any height @xmath42 .",
    "then , defining @xmath45 to be the height over which the field has significant lorentz forces , the typical size of contribution to the surface integral equation  ( [ eq : gaussdiv ] ) from two opposite lateral boundaries located at @xmath46 is ,    @xmath47    the expression for the typical size of the contribution to the surface integral equation  ( [ eq : gaussdiv ] ) from the pair of lateral boundaries at @xmath48 and @xmath49 , based on the difference @xmath50 between the lorentz forces at @xmath48 and @xmath49 at height @xmath42 , is identical .",
    "the contributions from the two pairs of lateral boundaries are the same because , from equations  ( [ eq : horizderivs ] ) , the horizontal magnetic length scale is ( approximmately ) the same , @xmath38 , in both horizontal directions , and because , from equation  ( [ eq : latbdy ] ) , @xmath51 is proportional to both @xmath52 and @xmath53 .    comparing equations  ( [ eq : photbdy ] ) and ( [ eq : latbdy ] ) , the lateral surface contributions are small enough to be neglected if @xmath54 , _ i.e. _ , if ,    @xmath55    where    @xmath56    the comparison in equation  ( [ eq : latcomp ] ) is independent of the horizontal dimensions @xmath52 and @xmath53 of the domain of integration .",
    "so long as the magnetic structure is large and coherent enough that the condition equation  ( [ eq : latcomp ] ) is met , the lorentz force can be approximated neglecting the lateral boundary contributions .",
    "it remains to consider the contribution to equation  ( [ eq : gaussdiv ] ) from the top boundary at @xmath36 , which has typical size    @xmath57    where @xmath58 is a typical field strength at the height @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , the contribution from the top boundary can be neglected if @xmath59 , _ i.e. _ , if    @xmath60    equations  ( [ eq : latcomp ] ) and ( [ eq : topcomp ] ) describe conditions where the lateral and top boundary contributions to the lorentz force integral equation  ( [ eq : gaussdiv ] ) are much smaller than the photospheric contributions , and can be neglected , so that the whole - surface integrals can be approximated by the lower boundary integrals alone . under these conditions ,",
    "a reasonable lorentz force estimate can be performed using photospheric measurements alone",
    ". equations  ( [ eq : latcomp ] ) and ( [ eq : topcomp ] ) represent criteria that we will use to test various model fields in section  [ sect : lfintegral ] of the paper .",
    "clearly , not all fields pass this test .",
    "for example , with any force - free field the three components of equation  ( [ eq : gaussdiv ] ) must be zero , and these integrals therefore can not possibly have dominant lower boundary contributions ; @xmath61 can not be much larger than both @xmath51 and @xmath62 .",
    "in these cases , therefore , the lateral and top boundary integrals can not be neglected , and the lower boundary integral can not accurately represent the whole boundary integral .",
    "a good lorentz force estimate therefore can not be derived from photospheric measurements alone for force - free fields . to satisfy equations  ( [ eq : latcomp ] ) and ( [ eq : topcomp ] )",
    ", the flux distribution must be very different from that of a force - free field : the field strength must fall off sufficiently sharply with height that the photospheric contribution to the force integral equation  ( [ eq : gaussdiv ] ) is dominant . with flux conservation",
    "this means that the field must contain significant return flux ( escape through the bottom boundary ) and/or flux tube expansion ( escape through the lateral boundaries ) .",
    "but the details of how the flux escapes from the domain to achieve this stratification are not directly relevant to equations  ( [ eq : latcomp ] ) and ( [ eq : topcomp ] ) .",
    "the condition imposed by fisher _",
    "et al . _  ( 2012 ) , that the field integrals over the top and lateral boundaries must be negligible , is a sufficient but not a necessary condition for equations  ( [ eq : latcomp ] ) and ( [ eq : topcomp ] ) to be fulfilled . equations  ( [ eq : latcomp ] ) and ( [ eq : topcomp ] ) can be fulfilled within an active region if the field strength decreases with height fast enough and the lateral boundary pressure differences are not too large . in section  [",
    "sect : lfintegral ] we will use models to determine whether fields can be sufficiently steeply stratified under solar conditions that both of equations  ( [ eq : latcomp ] ) and ( [ eq : topcomp ] ) are satisfied for reasonable horizontal length scales @xmath38 .    before we introduce models",
    ", we can note that the solar atmospheric field strength does indeed fall off sharply according to various observations summarized by gary  ( 2001 ) , and this is what is needed to satisfy equations  ( [ eq : latcomp ] ) and ( [ eq : topcomp ] ) .",
    "moreover , metcalf _",
    "et al . _  ( 1995 ) estimated that the atmosphere is approximately force - free ( _ i.e. _ , much less forced than the photosphere ) about 400  km above the photosphere .",
    "this result suggests that a box of integration with height @xmath63  km would capture all significant lorentz forces . crudely estimating @xmath64 from equation  ( [ eq : izdef ] ) , equation  ( [ eq : latcomp ] ) then says that for magnetic structures of characteristic horizontal length scale @xmath65  km , the contribution @xmath51 to equation  ( [ eq : gaussdiv ] ) should be negligible .",
    "this crude estimate leads us to expect that many photospheric lorentz forces may be estimated using photospheric field measurements alone , but it does not adequately take into account the effects of solar atmospheric stratification .",
    "not only does it ignore the effect of the photospheric fields generally being much stronger than most of the fields crossing the lateral boundary , but also the small but finite contributions to the lorentz forces from fields in and above the chromosphere .    to explore the influence of solar atmosphere stratification on the validity of the result ,",
    "it is necessary to rely on a model for the stratification of the solar atmospheric field .",
    "current extrapolation solutions are too weakly stratified to reproduce the stratification of the solar atmosphere from the photosphere to the corona .",
    "this applies not only to force - free fields that we discussed above , but also to non - force - free fields .",
    "non - force - free extrapolations are rare , but hu _ et al .",
    "_  ( 2010 ) presented such a model based on an optimized linear combination of a potential field and two linear force - free fields .",
    "this model may represent the lorentz forces reasonably well at the height of the observations in the photosphere , but not the great differences between the measured photospheric fields and the nearly force - free fields only a few hundred km above . to determine whether fisher _ et al . _",
    "s  ( 2012 ) equations can give useful estimates of major photospheric lorentz force changes within active regions using photospheric data , it is essential to represent the solar stratification accurately .",
    "we need another approach . in this paper",
    "we apply instead the simple and observationally constrained model of solar atmospheric stratification presented by gary  ( 2001 ) .",
    "the solar corona has a complex structure with the plasma pressure and magnetic pressure dominant in different domains .",
    "the plasma pressure tends to be very dominant in the solar interior , though this may not be the case in some intense sunspot fields near the surface .",
    "the magnetic pressure tends to dominate between the chromosphere and mid - corona , though some atmospheric structures such as weak - field prominences seem likely to have significant plasma forces . in the open - field domain of the high corona the thermal and kinetic pressures of the expanding solar wind dominate the magnetic pressure , forcing the field to open at heights around a solar radius .",
    "the dimensionless parameter that characterizes this competition between the magnetic pressure @xmath66 and plasma pressure @xmath67 is the plasma @xmath5 ,    @xmath68    generally , @xmath69 in the photosphere and @xmath70 between the chromosphere and mid - corona , and becomes @xmath71 again around a solar radius above the photosphere ( gary ,  2001 ) .",
    "estimates of the relative contributions to the force integral equation  ( [ eq : gaussdiv ] ) from photospheric compared to non - photospheric heights must account for both the decrease in magnetic field strength as a function of height and the increasing force - freeness of the field as a function of height .",
    "of course the lorentz force can not be measured throughout the atmosphere , only at heights where magnetically sensitive spectral lines are formed .",
    "practically , this restricts observational estimates of lorentz forces to the thin layers of the photosphere up to the chromosphere .",
    "the height - dependence of the solar magnetic field is difficult to determine observationally because , while observations of chromospheric and coronal zeeman lines are becoming more common ( _ e.g. _ , lin _ et al .",
    "_ ,  2004 ; tomczyk _ et al .",
    "_ ,  2008 ; rachmeler _ et al .",
    "_ ,  2013 ) , the height of formation of the chromospheric lines can be ambiguous , and projection effects pose problems of interpretation for optically thin corona plasmas .",
    "furthermore , detailed interpretation of asymmetric stokes profiles is complicated by magnetic gradients and flows .",
    "direct measurement of zeeman splitting can provide tests of inversion methods but only for very strong fields .",
    "the formation height of the na  d line is believed to be about 600  km , a few pressure scale heights above the formation height of the photospheric fe  i lines . from mees solar observatory na  d data metcalf _ et al .",
    "_  ( 1995 ) estimated a magnetic field gradient of about 0.8 - 1.1  g  km@xmath72 ( 1  g=1  gauss ) , which seems to be a typical estimate for the first mm above the photosphere ( gary ,  2001 ) . from prominence magnetic field observations , harvey  ( 1969 ) found an exponential field gradient of about 1.6  g  km@xmath72 , representing a height range of about 10  mm , above which height the field is believed to decrease in strength more steeply  ( gary ,  2001 ) .",

    "figure  [ fig : gary ] shows plots of four models described by equation  ( [ eq : bprofile ] ) : the sunspot model ( solid curve ) the plage model ( dot - dash curve ) and two intermediate models with photospheric field strengths @xmath83  kg ( dashed curve ) and 500  g ( dotted curve ) . we have set @xmath81  g and @xmath82  g in all four of our models since these constants represent the mid - coronal and global - coronal field strengths above the same active region in all four cases .",

    "whereas for the umbral field model @xmath99 integrated up to 1  mm almost matches its integral up to 1000  mm , for the plage field model there is a an order of magnitude difference between the @xmath99 integrals for the two heights .",
    "this suggests that the contribution to the magnetic pressure integral @xmath99 integral above around 1  mm may be negligible in the case of umbral fields but not for plage fields . for the intermediate field models",

    "@xmath98 represents the height where the opacity @xmath2 at 5000   , the usual definition of the photospheric surface .",
    "the vertical dotted lines in figure  [ fig : lfintegral ] indicate the approximate height @xmath101  km in the photosphere from where typical hmi observations derive according to fleck , couvidat , and strauss  ( 2011 ) . from correlations between simulated doppler velocities and",
    "derived dopplergrams , fleck , couvidat , and strauss  ( 2011 ) concluded that the hmi observations of the fe  i 6173    line originate from heights lower than the line core formation height , about 100  km .",
    "they found a similar result for the mdi signal , around 125  km , for the ni  i line at 6768    also used by gong .",
    "one may expect a similar result for the fe  i line at 6302.5    used by _",
    "hinode _ and the nso _ synoptic optical long - term investigations of the sun _ ( solis ) vector spectro - magnetograph ( vsm ) , though the calculation has not been performed for this line .",
    "fleck , couvidat , and strauss  ( 2011 ) also estimated that smearing effects associated with the instrumentation make the fine structure in the images appear to correspond to heights about 40 - 50  km higher in the photosphere .",
    "however , for the large , well resolved magnetic structures that we are considering , sunspot and neutral - line structures much larger than the hmi pixel size @xmath3 , the smearing effect is unlikely to be important .",
    "we therefore adopt the height @xmath102  km as the photospheric boundary for our lorentz force estimates .",
    "we repeated the following analysis with the value @xmath103  km and found similar results .",
    "over - plotted on each curve in figure  [ fig : lfintegral ] ( top ) are three asterisks , three triangles and three circles .",
    "the three asterisks on each curve represent the heights @xmath45 where    @xmath104    for the three cases with @xmath105 , 0.95 , and 0.99 , and @xmath106  mm .",
    "this value of @xmath107 corresponds to the typical height of a flare hard x - ray ( hxr ) source found in a statistical study of _ yohkoh _ data by matsushita _",
    "et al . _  ( 1992 ) .",
    "thus , on each curve , the first asterisk indicates the height @xmath36 where 90% of the total magnetic pressure between the height of the hmi observations ( @xmath34 ) and the height of a typical hxr source ( @xmath108  mm ) is confined to heights below @xmath36 .",
    "the second and third asterisks show the heights @xmath45 that contain 95% and 99% of the magnetic pressure .",
    "the three triangles show the equivalent heights @xmath45 for @xmath109  mm , a typical heigh of a tall active region loop .",
    "the three circles show the equivalent heights @xmath45 for @xmath110  mm , which roughly represents the height high in the corona where the expanding solar wind dominate the magnetic field .",
    "the plot shows that , while most of the magnetic pressure associated with each of the four models is concentrated low in the atmosphere , @xmath45 needs to be at least several mm in size for any but the strongest field models to concentrate more than 90% of the magnetic pressure below @xmath36 .",
    "the magnetic pressure surely overestimates the size of the maxwell stress and lorentz force in the corridor between approximately @xmath111  mm and @xmath112  mm where the plasma @xmath70 and the field is likely to be approximately force - free , with the magnetic pressure gradient force opposed by the magnetic tension force . in a nearly force - free field",
    "the maxwell stress is not well approximated by the magnetic pressure alone . to estimate the effect of this force - freeness on the lorentz force integral",
    "we modify the integral equation  ( [ eq : magpressure ] ) to become ,    @xmath113    using the factor    @xmath114    to simulate the varying influence of force - freeness as a function of height .",
    "this forces the integrand of equation  ( [ eq : lfestimate ] ) to equal the magnetic pressure @xmath66 where @xmath70 and the plasma pressure @xmath67 where @xmath69 .",
    "the reason for defining equation  ( [ eq : lfestimate ] ) in this way is as follows .",
    "if @xmath69 then the magnetic field is dominated by the plasma so that the maxwell stress has the typical size @xmath66 of the magnetic pressure . if @xmath70 then the magnetic field dominates the plasma , and much of the maxwell stress is contained within the magnetic field : the magnetic pressure gradient can be opposed not only by the plasma pressure gradient but also by the magnetic tension force .",
    "the resulting lorentz force is then smaller than the magnetic pressure gradient force . since the plasma pressure gradient force is expected to balance this lorentz force we set these forces to have equal size wherever @xmath70 . in cases with @xmath115",
    "the magnetic pressure and tension forces almost cancel and the field is approximmately force - free .",
    "we model this relationship between low plasma-@xmath5 values and the force - freeness of the field using the factor @xmath116 in equation  ( [ eq : lfestimate ] ) .    this simple model for the lorentz force does not capture the complexity of force vectors in active regions .",
    "it is designed to describe the general size of the lorentz force at different heights . in reality",
    "the direction of this vector can become an important consideration .",
    "for example , if a component of the lorentz force vector becomes small at some location in the photosphere then contributions to equation  ( [ eq : gaussdiv ] ) from higher in the atmosphere might become significant at this location .",
    "however , such contributions would be small compared to the contributions from the photosphere generally and would not obscure the overall photospheric lorentz force pattern .",
    "figure  [ fig : lfintegral ] ( bottom ) shows how this modified integral equation  ( [ eq : lfestimate ] ) for the integrated lorentz force @xmath117 varies as a function of height for each of the four magnetic field models , and comparing the two panels of figure  [ fig : lfintegral ] reveals the effect of the varying plasma @xmath5 .",
    "the integrals have become slightly smaller and the curves between @xmath111  mm and @xmath112  mm , where the plasma @xmath70 , are significantly flatter for the @xmath117 integrals ( bottom panel ) than for the @xmath99 integrals ( top panel ) .",
    "the contributions to the @xmath117 integral equation  ( [ eq : lfestimate ] ) from the nearly force - free fields between these heights is small enough to be negligible for the umbral model and the intermediate 1000  g model .",
    "for the 500  g model the integral up to 1  mm is about 90% of the integral up to 100  mm .",
    "figure  [ fig : lfintegral ] ( bottom ) also shows three asterisks , triangles and circles on each curve .",
    "these symbols correspond to heights @xmath45 where ,    @xmath118    where @xmath119  mm ( asterisks ) , 100  mm ( triangles ) , and 1000  mm ( circles ) , and the three symbols in each case represent @xmath105 , 0.95 , and 0.99 as in the top panel of figure  [ fig : lfintegral ] discussed above .",
    "it is clear from the bottom plot that , taking into account only fields up to 10  mm ( asterisks ) , over 90% of the estimated lorentz force is concentrated in @xmath120 with @xmath121  mm for all four models .",
    "if we relax our conditions to include all fields up to 100  m ( triangles ) , then we still capture over 90% of the estimated lorentz forces within @xmath120 with @xmath122  mm for the three strongest models , excluding only the model for plage fields ( dot - dashed curve ) .",
    "if we consider all fields up to 1000  mm then the two strongest models still contain more than 90% of their estimated lorentz forces within the layer @xmath120 with @xmath121  mm . for @xmath109  mm over 95% of the two strongest models estimated lorentz forces",
    "are contained within @xmath120 with @xmath121  mm , and for @xmath106  mm this percentage goes up to over 99% .",
    "these results indicate that if we set @xmath123  mm and neglect all lorentz force contributions above that height , then we can expect to miss less than 10% associated with active region loops with @xmath124  g photospheric fields ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath124  g at the @xmath2 opacity surface at 5000   ) , and less than 5% for loops with @xmath125  kg fields .",
    "a value @xmath123  mm therefore seems to be suggested by these considerations .",
    "now we need to check the sizes of the contributions to equation  ( [ eq : gaussdiv ] ) from the different boundaries as discussed in section  [ sect : subdomain ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : bdycomp ] allows a visual comparison between the contributions to the lorentz force surface integral equation  ( [ eq : gaussdiv ] ) from the photospheric boundary and the lateral boundaries ( top plot ) and the top boundary ( bottom plot ) .",
    "the top plot shows the quantity @xmath126 for each of the four field models as a function of top boundary height @xmath45 . for any value of @xmath45",
    ", the horizontal magnetic spatial scale @xmath38 of the structure must be comfortably larger than this quantity if the lateral boundary contribution @xmath51 is to be negligible - see equation  ( [ eq : latcomp ] ) .",
    "the three asterisks , triangles and circles per curve in figure  [ fig : bdycomp ] ( top ) represent the values of @xmath45 shown in figure  [ fig : lfintegral ] ( bottom ) for the estimated lorentz force . the cluster of symbols near and below @xmath127  mm is concentrated between values @xmath128  km and 300  km .",
    "the plot therefore shows that for the size of @xmath121  mm discussed above , @xmath38 must be significantly larger than 200  km or 300  km .",
    "since this scale is significantly smaller than the typical length scales of the sunspots and major neutral lines generally studied using this method ( _ e.g. _ , wang _ et al .",
    "_ ,  2012 ; petrie , 2012 , 2013 ) , this result indicates that the contributions to equation  ( [ eq : gaussdiv ] ) from the lateral boundaries , @xmath51 , can be neglected for such structures , particularly those whose fields have strength corresponding to the two strongest models ( @xmath129  kg at @xmath98 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : bdycomp ] ( bottom ) shows the ratio between the top and photospheric boundary contributions to equation  ( [ eq : gaussdiv ] ) , @xmath130 , as a function of top boundary height @xmath45 for each model . for values of @xmath45 where this ratio is @xmath131 ,",
    "the contribution @xmath62 to equation  ( [ eq : gaussdiv ] ) can be neglected .",
    "the three asterisks , triangles and circles per curve in this plot again represent the values of @xmath45 shown in figure  [ fig : lfintegral ] ( bottom ) for the estimated lorentz force . for the cluster of symbols near and below @xmath127  mm ,",
    "the ratio @xmath130 is between @xmath132 and @xmath133 , indicating that the contribution @xmath62 can also be neglected from estimates based on equation  ( [ eq : gaussdiv ] ) for our magnetic structures of interest .",
    "there is some tension between equations  ( [ eq : latcomp ] ) and ( [ eq : topcomp ] ) which can be seen by comparing the two plots of figure  [ fig : bdycomp ] .",
    "one of the ratios plotted in the figure can not decrease without the other increasing : if the upper boundary height @xmath45 increases , the top boundary integral decreases but the lateral boundary integral must increase . on the other hand",
    ", stratification supports both inequalities in the same way , concentrating the forces near the lower boundary and making the lower boundary integral more dominant .",
    "the most stratified models ( solid and dashed lines ) therefore have the smallest ratios in both panels of figure  [ fig : bdycomp ] .    in figure",
    "[ fig : bdycomp ] we have again represented the maxwell stress tensor equation  ( [ eq : maxwelltensor ] ) by the magnetic pressure .",
    "the symbols of interest in figure  [ fig : bdycomp ] appear at heights below @xmath111  mm and mostly correspond to plasmas with @xmath134 , where the magnetic pressure gradient likely represents the size of the lorentz force reasonably well . in the strongest models @xmath5",
    "becomes @xmath135 at heights @xmath136  mm . in these cases",
    "the lorentz force likely becomes smaller than the magnetic pressure gradient where @xmath70 because the magnetic tension generally must help the plasma pressure gradient force to oppose the magnetic pressure gradient force .",
    "since this effect becomes larger as the height increases , the fall - off of the lorentz force with height is therefore likely to be underestimated for the strongest models shown in figure  [ fig : bdycomp ] .",
    "however , the equivalent plots of figure  [ fig : bdycomp ] with @xmath137 replaced by @xmath138 ( not shown ) produced little effect on the cluster of symbols near @xmath127  mm , suggesting that our simple model based on the magnetic pressure @xmath66 adequately represents the maxwell stress tensor within the height range of interest .",
    "we conclude that for strong magnetic fields the contribution to the lorentz force estimate from fields at height above around 1  mm can be neglected . for photospheric subdomains filled with large , coherent structure and strong magnetic field , the contributions to the surface integrals derived by fisher _",
    "et al . _  ( 2012 ) are negligible compared to the contribution from the photospheric boundary .",
    "this implies that fisher _ et al . _",
    "s  ( 2012 ) method for estimating lorentz force changes on the photosphere during solar flares using equations  ( [ eq : fr ] ) and ( [ eq : fh ] ) can be applied to subdomains within a flaring active region , so long as the conditions on strength of field and coherence of structure are met within this photospheric subdomain . for hmi data , and for data originating from similar heights in the solar atmosphere",
    ", the horizontal length scale of the structure needs to be much larger than 300  km and the field needs to be stronger than about 630  g at the height of the observations ( @xmath1  kg at the @xmath2 opacity layer at 5000   ) .",
    "this conclusion therefore supports many of the published surface integral calculations based on fisher _ et al . _",
    "s method , such as those by petrie  ( 2012 , 2013 ) , who used regular rectangular integration domains covering strong neutral line fields and circular domains covering sunspots , and wang and liu  ( 2010 ) and wang _ et al .",
    "_  ( 2012 ) , who used irregular domains covering strong sunspot and neutral line fields . figure  [ fig : feb15flare ] shows the much - studied hmi vector magnetic field associated with the 15 february 2011 x2.2 flare .",
    "the plot shows that most of the important fields at the heart of the active region noaa 11158 are strong enough to meet the above conditions , and the major features of the region have horizontal spatial scale much larger than 300  km .",
    "note that fisher _ et al . _",
    "s  ( 2012 ) equations record only the lorentz force difference between two vector magnetogram measurements covering the same locations at different times . during a highly dynamic event such as a flare ,",
    "lorentz forces apply to different layers of the solar atmosphere , but only those layers whose fields have significant and steady lorentz force values before and after the flare will yield measurements that can be analyzed using this method . in a nearly force - free layer of the atmosphere",
    "the magnetic vectors may respond strongly to a flare .",
    "however , if the magnetic vector field in this layer is not accompanied by a significant and lasting lorentz force change associated with the flare then equations  ( [ eq : deltafr ] ) and ( [ eq : deltafh ] ) will not give a result that can be understood as a flare - related lorentz force vector change .",
    "this is true even if the flare produced a large and permanent change in the magnetic vector field .",
    "in some nearly force - free layers of the solar atmosphere , dynamical equilibration processes remove any significant lorentz forces from field configurations , erasing all traces of the lorentz force changes produced by flares .",
