    "due to the strong negative @xmath14-correction for galaxies at submillimeter ( submm ; @xmath15  = 3001000  @xmath16 m ) wavelengths , submm surveys facilitate observations of the high - redshift universe ( e.g. ,  blain & longair 1993 ) . for typical starburst galaxies and active galactic nuclei ( agns ) ,",
    "the expected submm flux density is approximately insensitive to redshift for @xmath17  110 .",
    "indeed , the majority of the submm - detected sources in  ( holland 1999 ) surveys appear to be extremely luminous infrared galaxies at @xmath17  16 ( e.g. , smail , ivison , & blain 1997 ; hughes 1998 ; ivison 1998 ; smail 2000 , 2002 ; dunlop 2001 ; blain 2002 ) .",
    "it is generally believed that these submm - detected sources are proto - galaxies undergoing intense dust - enshrouded star formation ( e.g. ,  blain 1999 ; lilly 1999 ) .",
    "however , evidence for agns has also been found using a variety of techniques .",
    "for example , optical spectroscopic observations have revealed agns in a number of optically bright submm sources ( e.g. ,  ivison 1998 ; barger 1999a ; soucail 1999 ) , and  observations of known optically bright quasi - stellar objects ( qsos ; i.e. ,  luminous type 1 agn ) have shown that luminous agns comprise a fraction of the submm source population ( e.g. ,  mcmahon 1999 ; page 2001 ; isaak 2002 ; willott 2002 ) . , it is probably of the order of @xmath18  510% . ]",
    "although clearly some  sources host agns , the ubiquity of agns in the submm source population , and their contribution to the submm emission , are poorly constrained .",
    "arguably the best discriminator of agn activity is the detection of hard x - ray emission ( i.e. ,  @xmath19  2  kev ) .",
    "hard x - ray observations are particularly useful in identifying agns in sources where the optical signatures are weak ( e.g. ,  optically faint agns or agns without strong emission lines ; vignati 1999 ; mushotzky 2000 ; alexander 2001 ; hornschemeier 2001 ) . due to their high - energy x - ray coverage , high x - ray sensitivity , and excellent positional accuracy ,",
    "the  ( weisskopf 2000 ) and  ( jansen 2001 ) observatories offer the best opportunities for the x - ray investigation of  sources .",
    "although sensitive enough to detect luminous agns out to high redshift , the cross - correlation of moderately deep x - ray surveys with  surveys has yielded little overlap between the x - ray and submm detected source populations ( fabian 2000 ; hornschemeier 2000 , 2001 ; severgnini 2000 ; barger 2001a ; almaini 2002 ; however , see also bautz 2000 and ivison 2002 ) .",
    "these studies have suggested that a large number of bolometrically important agns ( i.e. ,  agns that can dominate the submm emission ) can only be present in the submm source population if they are obscured by compton - thick ( i.e. ,  @xmath20  @xmath4 ) material .",
    "[ sourceexp ]    targeting x - ray sources detected in the 1  ms  deep field - north ( cdf - n ; brandt 2001 ) survey with  jiggle - map observations , barger ( 2001b ) showed that submm counterparts can be found for faint x - ray sources .",
    "five of the six x - ray detected submm sources with good x - ray constraints had flat ( @xmath10 ) effective x - ray spectral slopes , an indicator of obscured agn activity .",
    "however , while clearly showing that many of the agns found in submm sources are obscured , barger ( 2001b ) did not investigate the possibility that the absorption toward the agns is compton thick .",
    "thus strong constraints on the origin of the submm emission were not placed .",
    "the primary aim of this paper is to place strong constraints on the origin of the submm emission from agn - classified submm sources by determining if their agns are obscured by compton - thin or compton - thick material . in this study",
    "we focus on an @xmath2 region within the 2  ms cdf - n survey with excellent multi - wavelength data , including deep radio ( richards 1998 ; richards 2000 ) and optical / near - infrared ( near - ir ) observations ( barger 1999b ) . due to the extremely high sensitivity of the 2  ms survey",

    "the full 2  ms source catalog is presented in alexander ( 2003 ) .",
    "one hundred and ninety - three ( 193 ) x - ray sources are detected in the reduced hawaii flanking - field area with a wavdetect ( freeman 2002 ) false - positive probability threshold of 10@xmath27 down to on - axis 0.52.0  kev ( soft - band ) and 28  kev ( hard - band ) flux limits of @xmath28  erg  @xmath4  s@xmath5 and @xmath29  erg  @xmath4  s@xmath5 , respectively .",

    "the adaptively smoothed full - band 2  ms  image is shown in figure  1 .",
    "the positional uncertainties of the x - ray sources are @xmath30  10 , depending on off - axis angle ( see alexander 2003 ) , and the median positional uncertainty is 04 .",

    "in this study we focus on bright submm ( @xmath0  5  mjy ) sources detected with a signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) @xmath31  4 .",
    "this threshold was chosen to guard against possible spurious  sources ( e.g. ,  see the estimated number of spurious sources at different significance thresholds for the  observations of the elais - n2 and lockman hole east regions ; scott 2002 ) .",
    "the submm data used here was taken from a number of different studies ( hughes 1998 ; barger 2000 , 2002 ; borys 2002 ) .",
    "ten bright submm sources are detected with s / n@xmath31  4 ; see table  1 and figure  1 .",

    "20% of the sources in the total sample could be spurious ( e.g. ,  scott 2002 ) .",
    "although we have utilized all of the published  data currently available , this region only has complete  coverage down to @xmath32  12  mjy ( @xmath18  75% of the region has  coverage down to @xmath32  5  mjy ; e.g. ,  see figure 1 of barger 2002 ) . therefore , there are likely to be further bright submm sources in this region that have not yet been detected by .    two main observing techniques were employed in these studies : hughes ( 1998 ) and borys ( 2002 ) performed  scan - map observations while barger ( 2000 , 2002 ) performed  jiggle - map observations of radio and x - ray sources .",
    "the positional uncertainty of a  source is dependent on the signal - to - noise ratio and is typically @xmath18",
    "24@xmath9  ( e.g. , serjeant 2002 ; smail 2002 ; although see hogg 2001 ) .",
    "however , in the cases where radio and x - ray sources have been targeted with  jiggle - map observations , @xmath331@xmath9  positions can be inferred from the radio and x - ray data .",

    "three of the ten submm sources were detected in  scan maps and have positional uncertainties of @xmath18  24@xmath9 .",

    "dunlop ( 2002 ) used these data in combination with extremely sensitive merlin+vla 1.4  ghz radio observations to identify accurately the optical and near - ir counterpart for 123652.0 + 621225 .",
    "since this source is located in the hdf - n , the optical and near - ir constraints are more sensitive than for the other submm sources investigated here ( 123652.0 + 621225 has @xmath41 and @xmath42 ; dunlop 2002 ) .",
    "we must rely on the  positions for the other two sources since neither source has a radio or x - ray counterpart within 4@xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath18  24@xmath9  positional uncertainties for these sources are too large to be able to identify optical and near - ir counterparts relibably .",
    "only one of the submm sources has an optical spectroscopic redshift ( 123629.1 + 621045 has @xmath43 ; cohen 2000 ; hornschemeier 2001 ) and another source has a redshift estimate based on its multi - wavelength spectral energy distribution ( sed ; 123652.0 + 621225 has @xmath44 ; dunlop 2002 ) .",
    "however , on the assumption that the other sources obey the radio - to - far - infrared ( far - ir ; @xmath15  = 40120  @xmath16 m ) correlation found for local star - forming galaxies ( e.g. ,  helou , soifer , & rowan - robinson 1985 ) , we can estimate redshifts for all of the radio - detected sources , and place redshift lower limits on the radio - undetected sources , using the millimetric redshift technique ( e.g. , carilli & yun 1999 ) .",
    "since the submm emission corresponds to the longer wavelength rayleigh - jeans tail of the thermal dust emission detected at far - ir wavelengths , redshifts are directly determined ( albeit with considerable uncertainty ) on the basis of the radio - to - submm spectral slope . as noted by smail ( 2000 ) , this technique should give a lower limit on the source redshift when a component of the radio emission is produced by an agn .",
    "we determined millimetric redshifts using the redshift estimators of carilli & yun ( 2000 ) , eales ( 2000 ) , and rengarajan & takeuchi ( 2001 ) .",
    "we found that the eales ( 2000 ) estimator gave the lowest redshift determinations ( a minimum redshift of @xmath45 and a maximum redshift of @xmath46 ) , while the rengarajan & takeuchi ( 2001 ) estimator gave the highest redshift determinations ( a minimum redshift of @xmath47 and a maximum redshift of @xmath48 ) .",
    "the differences in the redshift determinations are due to the assumed sed and the temperature of the dust that produces the far - ir - to - submm emission .",
    "the millimetric redshifts of the source with an optical spectroscopic redshift ( 123629.1 + 621045 ; @xmath43 ) cover @xmath49  1.42.3 ( @xmath49  1.03.0 when the 1@xmath50 millimetric redshift uncertainties are taken into account ) .",
    "clearly the optical spectroscopic redshift of 123629.1 + 621045 is marginally in agreement with the millimetric redshift estimates ( we note that larger studies find a @xmath8  50% agreement between the optical spectroscopic redshifts and millimetric redshifts of submm sources ; e.g. ,  smail 2000 , 2002 ) .",
    "however , in the absence of better redshift estimations we must determine the redshifts for the majority of these sources using the millimetric redshift technique .",
    "the adopted millimetric redshifts for our sources are determined using the carilli & yun ( 2000 ) redshift estimator , which provides a good compromise between the eales ( 2000 ) and rengarajan & takeuchi ( 2001 ) millimetric redshift estimates ( see table 1 ) .",
    "we note that since the typical 1@xmath50 millimetric redshift uncertainty for a source is @xmath51@xmath49  0.8 ( the range of redshift uncertainties is @xmath51@xmath49  0.31.1 ) , the differences in these redshift determinations are not critical . however , even given these uncertainties , all sources have @xmath52 with all millimetric redshift estimators .",
    "five of the ten submm sources were detected by barger ( 2002 ) in  jiggle - map observations of x - ray sources and are thus x - ray detected submm sources ( see table  2 ) .",
    "we searched for x - ray counterparts for the other five submm sources using a 1@xmath9  matching radius for the three sources with a radio counterpart and a 4@xmath9  matching radius for the two sources without a radio counterpart .",
    "one further x - ray counterpart was found for one of the radio - detected submm sources ( 123622.6 + 621629 ; see table  2 ) .    given the low surface density of the submm sources , we can also search for lower significance x - ray sources associated with submm sources without introducing a significant number of spurious x - ray sources .",
    "we ran wavdetect with a false - positive probability threshold of 10@xmath53 and found one further match to a radio - detected submm source ( 123618.3 + 621551 ; see table  2 ) ; the probability of this x - ray - submm match being spurious is .",
    "this source was also detected in the 1  ms  exposure at a 10@xmath53 false - positive probability threshold ( alexander 2001 ) and is probably not detected here at a higher probability threshold since it lies within the bright extended x - ray source ( e.g. ,  bauer 2002a ) .",
    "thus , seven ( @xmath54% ) of the ten submm sources have x - ray counterparts .",
    "level ; these were calculated assuming poisson statistics . ]",
    "three submm sources are x - ray undetected .",
    "there is no evidence for excess x - ray emission in the  images for two of these sources ( 123620.3 + 621701 and 123621.1 + 621250 ) ; however , there is a suggestion of soft - band emission at the location of 123652.0 + 621225 . indeed ,",
    "123652.0 + 621225 lies within 02 of the position of an x - ray source detected by wavdetect at a 10@xmath55 false - positive probability threshold in the 1  ms cdf - n study of very red objects ( vros , @xmath56 ; alexander 2002b ) . since 123652.0",
    "+ 621225 lies closer to the x - ray source than the vro reported in alexander ( 2002b ) , it may actually be the correct counterpart to this extremely faint low - significance x - ray source .",
    "however , since the x - ray source is not detected at a higher significance level in the 2  ms  exposure , we consider 123652.0 + 621225 undetected here .    examining the association between  and  sources , almaini ( 2002 ) found little overlap between the source populations but detected a strong clustering signal .",
    "they suggested that  and  sources are generally unrelated ( at least down to the depths of their 75  ks  survey ) but trace the same large - scale structure .",
    "although there may be some large - scale structure effects present in our sample , the cross - correlation distances between our  and  sources are much smaller than the up to 100  @xmath9  clustering distances found by almaini ( 2002 ) .",
    "thus , we expect all of our x - ray - submm matches to be legitimate .",
    "[ fig : redshift1 ]      the derived density of x - ray detected submm sources in this region with @xmath0  5  mjy is @xmath6  deg@xmath7 .",
    "this source density should be considered a lower limit since there may be further bright submm sources with x - ray counterparts in this region that have not yet been detected by  ( see  2.2 ) .",
    "we can compare our source density to that found in other studies .",
    "the  survey of the elais - n2 and lockman hole east regions ( i.e. ,  scott 2002 ) contains sensitive  and  observations ( down to 0.58.0  kev flux limits of @xmath57  erg  @xmath4  s@xmath5 ; i.e. ,  manners 2002 ; hasinger 2001 ) .",
    "one  counterpart was matched to a submm source in the elais - n2 region ( almaini 2002 ) , corresponding to an x - ray detected submm source density of @xmath58  deg@xmath7 .",
    "four  counterparts were found for submm sources in the lockman hole east region ( ivison 2002 ) , corresponding to a higher x - ray detected submm source density of @xmath59  deg@xmath7 .",
    "the x - ray detected submm source densities found in our study are @xmath18  310 times higher than those found by almaini ( 2002 ) and ivison ( 2002 ) due to the greater sensitivity of the 2  ms  observations .",
    "three x - ray detected submm sources lie within 1  of the x - ray source ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "this extended x - ray source could be a high - redshift cluster or proto - cluster ( bauer 2002a ; chapman 2002b ) , and the similar millimetric redshifts of the three nearby x - ray detected submm sources suggest that they may be directly associated with cxohdfn j123620.0 + 621554 .",
    "the statistics are extremely poor on how common such sources are .",
    "however , if they are rare , then our x - ray detected submm source density is likely to be higher than average at this x - ray depth ; thus our sample may be affected by `` cosmic variance '' .",
    "the reduced hawaii flanking - field area does not have complete  coverage down to @xmath32  5  mjy ( see  2.2 ) , and hence we can not directly place constraints on the fraction of the bright submm source population with x - ray counterparts",
    ". however , based on the submm source density results of eales ( 2000 ) , and the compilations of blain ( 2002 ) , cowie , barger , & kneib ( 2002 ) , and smail ( 2002 ) , we would expect 3001000 submm sources per deg@xmath26 with @xmath0  5  mjy .",
    "this suggests that the fraction of bright submm sources in this region with x - ray counterparts is likely to be @xmath60% .",
    "note that this source fraction was not directly measured in our field and systematic effects could be present .",
    "two of the x - ray detected submm sources ( 123616.1 + 621513 and 123646.0 + 621448 ) have x - ray counterparts within 3@xmath9  ( see figure  2 ; alexander 2003 ) . in both cases",
    "one x - ray source has a radio counterpart and one does not .",
    "in addition , the radio - detected sources have @xmath61  2425 while the radio - undetected sources are optically blank . given the density of x - ray sources in this region , the probability of two x - ray sources lying within 3@xmath9  of each other is @xmath30  1% and therefore these associations appear to be significant .",
    "there are two obvious scenarios that can explain the close proximity of the sources in these two pairs : ( 1 ) these sources are merging or interacting , or ( 2 ) these sources are gravitationally lensed .",
    "unfortunately , since these sources are optically faint , we can not search for the features of merging , interacting , or gravitational lensing in the current optical images .",
    "however , in the gravitational - lensing scenario , each member of each pair would generally have similar fluxes at all wavelengths ( e.g. ,  see review by blandford & narayan 1992 ) .",
    "therefore , the fact that one member of each pair is detected at both optical and radio wavelengths , while the other is not , provides some evidence against gravitational lensing .    in both cases",
    "we have identified the radio - detected x - ray source as the counterpart to the submm source since the radio and submm emission are more closely matched in frequency space than the x - ray and submm emission .",
    "however , it is possible that the radio - undetected x - ray sources could contribute to a fraction of the submm emission .",
    "we show the submm flux density versus full - band x - ray flux of all the sources in figure  3 . as a comparison",
    "we also show the submm - detected -selected optically bright qsos ( i.e. ,  luminous type 1 agns ) of page ( 2001 ) .",
    "there is a clear distinction in x - ray flux between the qsos and our x - ray detected submm sources .",
    "the former would be detectable in @xmath62  ks  exposures , while the majority of the latter are only detectable in @xmath8100  ks  exposures .",
    "since optical spectroscopic observations of submm sources have shown that optically bright qsos probably comprise only a small fraction of the submm source population ( i.e. ,  @xmath18  510% , see footnote 1 ; e.g. ,  barger 1999a ; ivison 2000 ; smail 2002 ) , @xmath8100  ks  exposures are clearly required to detect x - ray counterparts for typical bright submm sources .",

    "[ fig : redshift1 ]    it is often assumed that the submm emission from sources detected in  surveys can provide an unobscured indicator of the star - formation rate ( e.g. ,  blain 1999 ) . however , five of the ten submm sources investigated here clearly host obscured agns . while the agns obviously dominate the x - ray emission in these sources ,",
    "this does not necessarily imply that the submm emission is also powered by the agns .",
    "unfortunately , the broad - band submm emission itself can not provide an unambiguous diagnostic of the nature of the dominant physical mechanism since it is likely to be reprocessed thermal emission produced via the absorption of the primary emission by dust grains .",
    "co observations can provide some insight into the origin of the submm emission by measuring the molecular gas mass and hence constrain the expected dust mass and emission from star formation ( e.g. ,  young & scoville 1991 ) .",
    "for instance , co observations have been used to show that star - formation activity may account for @xmath18  50% of the submm emission from the @xmath99 balqso smm j023990136 ( e.g. ,  frayer 1998 ) and perhaps all of the submm emission from the @xmath100 galaxy smm j14011 + 0252 ( e.g. ,  frayer 1999 ; ivison 2001 ) . however , in the absence of co observations we must adopt an indirect strategy in estimating the origin of the submm emission from our submm sources .      the relative importance of agn and star - formation activity in our submm sources can be estimated by comparing their submm - to - x - ray spectral slopes ( @xmath101 ) to those of well - studied nearby galaxies . we calculate @xmath101 as    @xmath102~\\times~0.163,\\ ] ]    where @xmath103 is the observed flux density at 2  kev ( kev  @xmath4  s@xmath5",

    "while 3c273 is clearly a powerful unobscured qso , ngc  6240 contains components of obscured agn and star - formation activity .",
    "by contrast , the emission from arp  220 appears to be entirely dominated by star formation .",
    "if an agn is present in arp  220 , then to remain undetected at x - ray energies it must be either of low luminosity , or have extreme absorption ( i.e. ,  @xmath105@xmath106  @xmath4 ) and a small component of scattered emission ( e.g. ,  iwasawa 2001 , 2002 ; clements 2002 ) . since ngc  6240 has a considerably flatter x - ray spectral slope than 3c273 and arp  220 , the analysis of the submm - to - x - ray spectral slopes requires knowledge of the x - ray photon index for each source .",
    "for instance , at a given submm luminosity , the 2  kev flux density of a @xmath107 source will be @xmath18  5 times lower than that of a @xmath68 source .",
    "therefore , when interpreting the data for an unobscured qso , the comparison should be made to 3c273 , while when interpreting the data for an obscured agn , the comparison should be made to ngc  6240 .",
    "the submm - to - x - ray spectral slope versus redshift of all the sources is shown in figure  7 .",
    "the agn - classified sources have larger @xmath101 values than ngc  6240 , suggesting that their agns are comparitively weaker at x - ray energies ( with respect to their submm emission ) . under the assumption that the obscuration in these sources is compton thin ( as expected for the majority of these sources ; see  3.3 ) , they are @xmath18  15150 times less luminous at x - ray energies ( for a given submm luminosity ) than ngc  6240 ( assuming a column density of @xmath108  @xmath4 ; i.e. ,  the top dotted line in figure  7 ) . taking all of the agn - classified sources together ,",
    "they are on average @xmath18  70 times less luminous at x - ray energies ( for a given submm luminosity ) than ngc  6240 .",
    "as can be seen from figure  7 , these results are relatively insensitive to redshift so long as the agn - classified sources lie at @xmath52 .",
    "the only source where we have evidence that this may not be the case is the possible compton - thick agn 123622.6 + 621629 ( see  3.3.1 and figure  6 ) . under the assumption that the obscuration to this source is the same as that found for ngc  6240 ( i.e. ,  compton - thick absorption with a 5% scattering fraction ; vignati 1999 ) , at @xmath17  0.46 it would be @xmath18  80 times less luminous at x - ray energies ( for a given submm luminosity ) than ngc  6240 ( see figure  7 ) .",
    "we suggested in  3 that the x - ray emission from the submm sources without good x - ray constraints may be produced by star - formation activity in some cases .",
    "this hypothesis is further supported for the two sources with millimetric redshifts of @xmath109 since their submm - to - x - ray spectral slopes are comparable to that expected from arp  220 at @xmath52 ( see figure  7 ) . however , we can not distinguish between star - formation and agn scenarios for the three @xmath13 sources .",
    "although the individual constraints on the origin of the submm emission from the agn - classified sources are weak , they all clearly have larger submm - to - x - ray spectral slopes than ngc  6240 .",
    "even though ngc  6240 is a nearby source ( @xmath18  115  mpc in our chosen cosmology ) , the origin of its submm emission is poorly known . for instance , the application of radiative transfer models shows that the far - ir - to - submm emission can be almost completely explained by starburst activity ( rowan - robinson & crawford 1989 ) , and the infrared ( imaging and spectroscopy ) characteristics of ngc  6240 suggest that star formation dominates the bolometric luminosity ( genzel 1998 ) .",
    "furthermore , its nuclear optical spectrum shows the characteristics of a liner ( e.g. ,  veilleux 1995 ) .",
    "conversely , consideration of the energetics of the agn derived from x - ray observations suggests that it may contribute @xmath18  50% of the far - ir - to - submm luminosity ( e.g. ,  iwasawa & comastri 1998 ; vignati 1999 ; lira 2002 ) .    assuming that the agn completely dominates the submm emission in ngc  6240 ( an extreme hypothesis ) and the x - ray emission from the agn scales linearly with submm luminosity",
    ", the contribution to the submm emission from agn activity in the agn - classified sources would be 0.66.6% ( as determined from the @xmath18  15150 times difference in x - ray luminosity for a given submm luminosity ; see  4.1 ) .",
    "following the same assumptions , the average contribution to the submm emission from agn activity would be @xmath18  1.4% .",
    "hence , although there is considerable uncertainty in the agn contribution at submm wavelengths , these analyses strongly suggest that the submm emission is dominated by star - formation activity .",
    "this conclusion is likely to be valid even if the @xmath13 sources are also found to contain agns ( see figure  7 ) .",
    "it has been known for some time that agns comprise a fraction of the submm source population .",
    "indeed , the first identified source in a  blank - field survey was found to be an agn ( smm j023990136 ; ivison 1998 ) , and at least three of the 15 submm - detected sources in the -lens survey are agns ( smail 2002 ) . in all these cases the evidence for agn activity",
    "was found via optical spectroscopy of optically bright sources .",
    "the advantage of searching for agns with x - ray observations is that the limitations of optical spectroscopy are removed , allowing optically faint agns and agns without strong emission lines to be identified ( e.g. ,  vignati 1999 ; mushotzky 2000 ; alexander 2001 ; hornschemeier 2001 ) . however , obviously the lack of optical spectroscopy for the majority of our sources leads to considerable uncertainties in their source redshifts . in this final section ,",
    "we discuss the dependence of our results on the assumed source redshifts , the fraction and properties of agns in the submm source population , and the agn contribution to the submm emission in  sources .",
    "the redshifts for the majority of the submm sources are derived from the radio - to - submm spectral slope and are uncertain .",
    "as mentioned in  4.1 these uncertainties should not change our main result ( i.e. ,  that the average agn contribution to the submm emission is of the order of @xmath18  1.4% ) so long as the sources lie at @xmath52 .",
    "however , we note here that since the redshift tracks for the template galaxies rise to lower values of @xmath101 at @xmath110 ( see figure  7 ) , the case for star formation dominating the submm emission is even stronger for sources at lower redshifts ( as may be the case for ; see  3.3.1 ) .",
    "finally , we also note that although the implied column densities and x - ray luminosities of the agn - classified sources will be lower if they lie at @xmath110 , since @xmath10 power - law emission is only likely to be produced by obscured agn activity , their classification as agns is insensitive to redshift .      in this study",
    "we have shown that five of the seven x - ray detected submm sources appear to be obscured agns , placing a lower limit on the source density of obscured agns with @xmath0  5  mjy of @xmath111  deg@xmath7 . under the same assumptions as those used in determining the fraction of the bright submm source population with x - ray counterparts ( see  2.4.2 ) , this suggests that @xmath8  26% of the bright submm source population host agns ( in reasonable agreement with model predictions ; e.g. ,  almaini , lawrence , & boyle 1999 ; fabian & iwasawa 1999 ) .",
    "ivison ( 2002 ) found a similar agn fraction to that derived here using the moderately deep  observations of the lockman hole east region ( e.g. ,  hasinger 2001 ) .",
    "however , their submm - detected agn source density is @xmath18  2 times smaller ( i.e. ,  @xmath59  deg@xmath7 versus @xmath111  deg@xmath7 ) .",
    "the difference in the submm - detected agn source densities is mostly due to the higher sensitivity of our x - ray observations .",
    "hence the similarity between the agn fraction found by ivison ( 2002 ) and our lower limit may indicate that our estimated agn fraction is conservative .",
    "the unabsorbed rest - frame full - band luminosities of the agn - classified sources are @xmath11@xmath12  erg  s@xmath5 .",
    "this range of x - ray luminosity is typical of luminous seyfert galaxies .",
    "therefore , although the majority of the submm sources are likely to be extremely luminous infrared galaxies ( e.g. ,  ivison 1998 ; smail 2002 ) , their agns are comparitively weak .",
    "for example , typical qsos of similar infrared luminosity ( e.g. ,  isaak 2002 ; page 2001 ) are @xmath18  10100 times more luminous at x - ray energies ( e.g. ,   page 2001 ; vignali 2001 , 2003 ) . under the assumption that bright submm sources are massive proto galaxies ( e.g. ,  blain 1999 ; lilly 1999 ) , the luminosities of these agns are consistent with those expected for growing supermassive black holes ( e.g. ,  archibald 2002 ) .",
    "the current constraints suggest that the total contribution to the submm emission from agn activity is unlikely to be more than @xmath18  1.4% ; however , as noted in  2.2 , there are likely to be further bright submm sources in our region that have not yet been detected by . in addition , we have not considered the possible contribution from optically bright submm - detected qsos .",
    "although optically bright submm - detected qsos may comprise only @xmath18  510% of the bright submm source population ( see footnote 1 ) , their submm emission could have a large agn component ( perhaps of the order of @xmath18  50% ; frayer 1998 ; bautz 2000 ) .",
