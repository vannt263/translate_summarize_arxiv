    "if the diffeomorphisms and the isotopies are allowed to permute the points on the boundary of @xmath0 , then we get the group @xmath4 .",
    "the extended mapping class group @xmath5 of @xmath0 is defined to be the group of isotopy classes of all ( including orientation - reversing ) diffeomorphisms of @xmath0 .",
    "these three groups are related to each other as follows : @xmath4 is contained in @xmath5 as a subgroup of index two and the groups @xmath2 and @xmath4 fit into a short exact sequence @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the subgroup of @xmath2 generated by the dehn twist about a simple closed curve parallel to the boundary component of @xmath0 .    in this paper , we will be interested in the groups @xmath2 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the mapping class group and the extended mapping class group of the closed surface of genus @xmath1 obtained from @xmath0 by gluing a disc along the boundary component are denoted by @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the mapping class group is a central object in low - dimensional topology .",
    "therefore , its algebraic structures are of interest .",
    "the problem of finding the generators for the mapping class group of a closed orientable surface was first considered by dehn .",
    "he proved in  @xcite that @xmath8 is generated by a finite set of dehn twists .",
    "about quarter century later , lickorish  @xcite also proved the same result , showing that @xmath10 dehn twists generate @xmath8 .",
    "this number was improved to @xmath11 by humphries  @xcite .",
    "these @xmath11 generators are the dehn twists about the curves @xmath12 in figure  [ figure1 ] , where the closed surface is obtained from @xmath0 by gluing a disc along the boundary component .",
    "humphries proved , moreover , that in fact the number @xmath11 is minimal ; i.e. @xmath8 can not be generated by @xmath13 ( or less ) dehn twists .",
    "johnson  @xcite proved that the @xmath11 dehn twists about @xmath12 on @xmath0 also generate @xmath2 .",
    "finally , the minimal number of generators for the mapping class group is determined by wajnryb  @xcite .",
    "he showed that @xmath2 , and hence @xmath8 , can be generated by two elements ; one is a product of two dehn twists ( one is right and one is left ) and the other is a product of @xmath13 dehn twists . since the mapping class group is not abelian , the number two is minimal .",
    "recently , it was shown by brendle and farb in  @xcite that the mapping class group is generated by three torsion elements and by seven involutions .    since @xmath4 is a quotient of @xmath2 , it is generated by the corresponding @xmath11 dehn twists . in order to generate the extended mapping class group @xmath5 ,",
    "it suffices to add one more generator , namely the isotopy class of any orientation - reversing diffeomorphism .    in this paper",
    "we have three main results .",
    "first , we improve wajnryb s result .",
    "we show that one of the two generators of @xmath2 can be taken as a dehn twist .",
    "all dehn twists involved in our generators are dehn - lickorish - humphries generators .",
    "we also prove that the extended mapping class group @xmath5 is generated by two elements , again one of which is a dehn twist .",
    "our proof is independent from that of wajnryb  @xcite .",
    "next , we prove that the mapping class groups @xmath4 and @xmath8 are also generated by two torsion elements .",
    "of course , this is not true for @xmath2 since it is torsion - free . in the last section of the paper ,",

    "we denote the curves by the letters @xmath18 ( possibly with subscripts ) and the dehn twists about them by the corresponding capital letters @xmath19 .",
