    "scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) has provided much useful information on surface configurations , with atomic resolution .",
    "the clean si(001 ) surface is vigorously studied by stm because of the great fundamental and technological importance of semiconductor devices . in the stm images of the 2@xmath41 structure on the terrace ,",
    "silicon dimers appear to be symmetric at room temperature due to the time average of the flip - flop motion of buckled dimers , while at temperatures below @xmath5200 k , the stable configuration is the @xmath6@xmath4@xmath7 or @xmath8@xmath4@xmath7 structure consisting of asymmetric dimer rows.@xcite for the @xmath6@xmath4@xmath7 structure , the dependence of the stm image on the bias voltage at 80 k has been studied in detail.@xcite on the other hand , the behavior of the dimers at step edges differs from that on the terrace .",
    "for example , the dimers at @xmath9 steps are observed to be buckled at both low and room temperatures.@xcite however , detailed observation of the @xmath9 steps has not been exhaustively carried out , since filled- and empty - state images at only a few bias voltages have been reported.@xcite    it is known that stm images reflect electronic structures rather than atomic geometries .",
    "consequently , bias - dependent stm images result from the variation of the spatial distribution of the local density of states ( ldos ) which is a function of energy .",
    "therefore , to interpret stm images properly , the spatial distributions of the ldos must be calculated strictly by _",
    "ab initio _ methods .",
    "some authors have attempted to compare experimental stm images with theoretical ones for the si(001 ) reconstructed surface.@xcite kageshima and tsukada carried out the simulation of polarity - dependent stm images of si(001 ) . however , their investigation was based on the semi - empirical method with linearly combined atomic orbitals.@xcite hata et al . pointed out that the @xmath0 , @xmath1 surface states and the @xmath2 , @xmath3 bulk ones contribute to the stm images , by calculating the spatial distributions of those states localized near the outermost atoms.@xcite these results emphasize that a reproduction of the stm image from the calculated spatial distribution of the ldos is very important . but such research is still limited at present .    in this paper ,",
    "we present an improved interpretation of stm images and provide a more profound understanding of the electronic structure for the clean si(001 ) surface .",
    "stm observations are performed on the buckled dimers at the @xmath9 step of the clean si(001 ) surface .",
    "they are strongly dependent on the applied bias voltage and the tip - sample separation , which is confirmed by _",
    "ab initio _ simulations .",
    "the stm images will be interpreted as isosurfaces of the spatial distribution of the ldos in the vacuum region between a tip and a sample , which is greatly different from the behavior of the ldos near the outermost atoms . moreover ,",
    "the calculated ldos shows how the spatial distributions of the characteristic surface states ( @xmath0 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 dangling - bond states ) and bulk states ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 si - si bond states ) contribute to the bias dependence of the stm images .",
    "experiments were performed in an ultrahigh - vacuum ( uhv ) chamber equipped with stm . the base pressure was less than 1@xmath4@xmath12 pa .",
    "the samples were si(001 ) ( b - doped , 0.20.5 @xmath13 cm ) wafers .",
    "they were degassed at 900 k overnight , flashed to 1450 k for 30 sec and then cooled to room temperature to prepare the clean si(001)-2@xmath41 surface .",
    "the tips were prepared by the electrochemical etching of a polycrystalline tungsten wire and cleaned by electron bombardment in uhv prior to use .",
    "the constant - current stm images were obtained at room temperature .",
    "the _ ab initio _ electronic - states calculations were performed by the self - consistent pseudopotential method within the density - functional theory.@xcite the exchange - correlation interaction was treated by the ceperley - alder form in the local - density approximation ( lda).@xcite the norm - conserving troullier ",
    "martins pseudopotentials@xcite were used in a separable nonlocal form.@xcite the wave functions were expanded in a plane - wave basis set with a cutoff energy of 24 ry .",
    "the si(001)-@xmath8@xmath4@xmath7 surface with asymmetric dimers was modeled as a repeated slab consisting of five silicon layers , the lowest of which was terminated by hydrogen atoms , and the width of the vacuum region was equivalent to that of 12 silicon layers .",
    "the four outermost silicon layers were fully optimized by the _ ab initio _ molecular - dynamics method.@xcite    many theoretical stm images have been generated in the tersoff - hamann approximation.@xcite this method is actually valid for many systems despite its extreme simplicity.@xcite in this scheme , the tunneling current is proportional to the surface ldos at the tip position integrated over the energy range restricted by the applied bias voltage .",
    "we calculated the ldos @xmath14 at spatial points @xmath15 and energy @xmath16 by sampling the 100 @xmath17-points of the surface brillouin zone ( sbz ) .",
    "the stm images were generated from the isosurface of the spatial distribution formed by the integration of the ldos over the energy range from fermi energy @xmath18 to @xmath18-@xmath19 with applied voltage @xmath20 , i.e. , @xmath21 .",
    "hereafter , we refer to this ` energy - integrated ldos ' as the ` ei - ldos ' .",
    "thereby the computed stm images correspond to experimental constant - current images .",
    "the atomic structure of the si(001)-@xmath8@xmath4@xmath7 surface was optimized by minimizing the total energy .",
    "the dimer bond length of 2.35  , which is the same length as the bond length in bulk silicon , and the buckling angle of @xmath22 were found .",
    "these values are similar to the dimer bond length of 2.38   and the buckling angle of @xmath23 for the @xmath8@xmath4@xmath7 reconstruction reported by shkrebtii _",
    "et al_.@xcite our calculated dimer bond length is longer than the 2.28   found by ramstad _",
    "et al_.@xcite and 2.31   by gunnella _",
    "et al_.@xcite the backbond lengths of the upper and lower atoms are 2.38 and 2.33  , respectively , which are longer than the of 2.34 and 2.31   reported by ramstad _",
    "et al_.@xcite and 2.33 and 2.30   by gunnella _",
    "et al_.@xcite    we calculated the band structure for the optimized si(001)-@xmath8@xmath4@xmath7 surface .",
    "this is formed at 100 equidistant points along the bloch wave vector @xmath24 in two - dimensional ( 001 ) sbz .",
    "figure  [ band - structure ] shows the band structure for the si(001)-@xmath8@xmath4@xmath7 surface along high - symmetry directions of the sbz .",
    "the single - particle calculation within the lda is well known to underestimate the band gap .",
    "although the band gap is calculated as 0.15 ev , all empty states of the band structure must shift rigidly upwards in energy by 0.65 ev.@xcite this value was determined from the results of angle - resolved photoemission,@xcite angle - resolved inverse photoemission,@xcite and scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts).@xcite the position of the fermi energy ( @xmath18 ) is determined at about 0.6 ev above the valence - band top and about 0.2 ev below the conduction - band bottom in order to coincide with our stm results .    filled @xmath0 and empty @xmath1 surface states separate into two filled ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) and empty ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) surface states in the bulk band gap , respectively .",
    "this feature is consistent with the results of other calculations.@xcite the filled @xmath25 and @xmath26 states disperse from 1.2 to 0.6 ev . although the empty @xmath10 state widely spreads from + 0.2 to + 1.1 ev , the empty @xmath11 state spreads at around + 1.1 ev .",
    "the @xmath25 and @xmath26 states , as well as the @xmath10 and @xmath11 states , overlap each other from the @xmath27 to the @xmath28 point ( in the direction perpendicular to the dimer rows ) .",
    "we aimed at obtaining the stm images of a buckled - dimer row at the @xmath9 step on the clean si(001)-2@xmath41 surface under different sample - bias conditions .",
    "figures  [ f - images ] ( filled states ) and  [ e - images ] ( empty states ) show the experimental stm images of the @xmath9 step and the simulated ones of the si(001)-@xmath29 . all stm images in figs .",

    "this simulated image is consistent with the experimental one and indicates that stm images depend on the magnitude of the surface ldos , i.e. , the tunneling conductance .",

    "when the sample bias and the tunneling current are set to + 1.5 and 0.5 ( 5.0 ) na , the distance of the ei - ldos from the surface contributing to the stm images is predicted to be 4.6 ( 3.7 )  .",

    "these striking features of the @xmath11 state lead to the deep trough in the middle of a dimer row and the bright oval - shaped protrusion at the upper dimer atom in the stm images at the sample bias from + 1.2 to + 2.0 v , as shown in figs .",

    "[ current - stm](a ) when a tunneling current is switched from 0.5 to 5.0 na at a sample bias of + 1.5 v. in other words , since the tip - sample separation is shorter and the stm image reflects the spatial distribution of the ldos nearer to the surface , the other trough emerges between dimer rows and each atom appears to be clearly resolved .",

    "therefore , we predict that the @xmath3 state is evident in the stm images at biases higher than + 2.1 v.    we have presented the features of the spatial distribution of each state in the ldos and revealed how the surface and bulk states contribute to stm images .",
    "we also demonstrated that the stm image of the clean surface can be interpreted as the isosurface of the spatial distribution of the ei - ldos in the vacuum region , which is greatly different from that near the outermost atoms .",
    "we have performed stm observations and theoretical simulations of stm images for the buckled dimer on the clean si(001 ) surface . by comparing the experimental results with theoretical ones , the relationship between stm images and the atomic structure of buckled dimers of the si(001 ) surface was clarified .",
    "the spatial distributions of the surface and si - si bond states in the ldos were investigated . for the filled states , the @xmath0 ( @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) surface states contribute to the low - bias stm images and , as the sample bias is increased , the si - si bond ( @xmath2 ) state is added to the @xmath0 states .",
    "since the corrugations of the spatial distributions of the @xmath0 and @xmath2 states are similar in vacuum , the filled - state images are nearly identical to each other . on the other hand , the empty - state images change considerably with relative to the sample bias .",
    "the stm images obtained at low biases reflect the spatial distribution of the @xmath43 surface states . as the sample bias is increased , the @xmath44 surface state begins to dominate the stm images , and a deep trough appears at the center of the dimer at high biases above + 1.3 ev .",
    "moreover , when the tunneling current is set to be larger , the ldos nearer to the sample surface contributes to the stm image .",
