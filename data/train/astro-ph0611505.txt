    "l dwarfs and t dwarfs are the two lowest - luminosity spectral classes of low mass stars and brown dwarfs known ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , spanning effective temperatures 700 @xmath2 t@xmath3 @xmath2 2300  k and luminosities -5.7 @xmath4 -3.5 @xcite .",
    "their photometric and spectral properties are remarkably distinct .",
    "l dwarfs typically exhibit red near - infrared colors ( @xmath5 ) , largely due to the presence of optically thick condensate dust in their photospheres .",
    "l dwarf spectra are characterized by weak bands of metal oxides ( with the exception of co ) , strong bands of metal hydrides ( including feh , crh and h@xmath6o ) and strong neutral metal lines , in particular alkali species .",
    "cooler t dwarfs , on the other hand , appear to have little or no condensate dust in their photospheres , exhibit prominent ch@xmath7 and h@xmath6o bands and pressure - broadened h@xmath6 absorption in their near - infrared spectra , and generally have blue near - infrared colors ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "there are @xmath1450 l dwarfs and @xmath1100 t dwarfs currently known , most identified in wide - field imaging surveys such as the two micron all sky survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter 2mass ) , the deep near - infrared survey of the southern sky ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter denis ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter sdss ) .",
    "the disparate properties of l dwarfs and t dwarfs have fostered attention on the transition between these two spectral classes , a transition that has proven to be rather unusual .",
    "it was recognized early on that the range of effective temperatures spanning the l / t transition is small , perhaps 100 - 300  k @xcite .",
    "this is surprising , given the dramatic changes in spectral morphology that occur over this range .",
    "parallax measurements of field sources further revealed an unexpected brightening of @xmath11  mag between the latest - type l dwarfs and earliest - type t dwarfs in the @xmath9-band ( @xmath10 ; @xcite ) .",
    "this is also surprising , given the slow decline in bolometric luminosities over this range .",
    "other unexpected trends across the l / t transition include the observed resurgence in gaseous feh bands , a species that is expected to be depleted by the formation of condensates in the l dwarfs @xcite ; a restrengthening of @xmath9-band lines after weakening considerably in the latest - type l dwarfs @xcite ; and enhanced co absorption at 4.7  @xmath11 , possibly due to vertical upwelling @xcite .",
    "the current generation of brown dwarf atmosphere models incorporating condensate clouds have been unable to reproduce these trends @xcite , so dynamical ( nonequilibrium ) processes such as cloud fragmentation @xcite , a change in condensate sedimentation efficiency @xcite and a global collapse of the condensate cloud layer @xcite have been evoked as possible drivers of the l / t transition . however , persistent empirical uncertainties , such as the unknown ages and surface gravities of field dwarfs @xcite and the role of unresolved binaries @xcite have obviated conclusive results .",
    "recent high resolution imaging studies have helped to clarify our empirical understanding of the l / t transition .",
    "these studies have identified binaries whose components straddle the transition @xcite , two of which  sdss j102109.69 - 030420.1ab , a t1 + t5 pair ( hereafter sdss  1021 - 0304 ) ; and sdss j153417.05 + 161546.1ab , a t1.5 + t5.5 pair ( hereafter sdss  1534 + 1615 )  have been particularly revealing . in both systems , the later - type secondary is the brighter source at @xmath9-band , indicating that the brightening trend observed in the parallax data is truly an intrinsic feature of the l / t transition @xcite .",
    "however , the brightening between the binary components , of order @xmath10.2  mag , is significantly less than previously inferred .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite have hypothesized that prior results have been biased by unresolved multiple systems .",
    "indeed , @xcite have demonstrated that the binary fraction of late - type l and early - type t dwarfs is as high as 40% , twice that of earlier - type l and later - type t dwarfs .",
    "this is likely a lower limit given the probable existence of more tightly bound , unresolved systems .",
    "indeed , @xcite hypothesize that most apparently single early - type t dwarfs may have unresolved companions .",
    "both studies ascribe this binary excess to the contamination of magnitude - limited samples by systems consisting of earlier - type and later - type components , whose composite spectra mimic an l / t transition object . while @xcite demonstrated that the binary excess can be roughly reproduced assuming a rapid evolution of brown dwarfs across the transition , several additional factors  including the uncertain cooling rate and absolute magnitude scale of brown dwarfs across the transition , the underlying mass ratio distribution and frequency of brown dwarf binaries , and possible systematic effects arising in magnitude - limited samples",
    " were not considered .",
    "hence , the origin of the binary excess and its implications on the properties of the l / t transition remain unsettled questions .    in this article ,",
    "i present monte carlo mass function and binary spectral synthesis simulations aimed at examining the origin of the l / t transition binary excess and its dependence on various underlying factors .",
    "the empirical multiplicity dataset is described in detail in @xmath12  2 . in @xmath12  3 ,",
    "the construction and implementation of the simulations are described , including realizations of the underlying mass function , binary frequency , mass ratio distribution , empirical luminosity and absolute magnitude trends , and the classification of unresolved binaries .",
    "results are presented in @xmath12  4 , focusing on number density , surface density and binary fraction distributions for local volume - limited and magnitude - limited samples , and their dependencies on various input parameters .",
    "results are discussed in @xmath12  5 , including a breakdown of the origin of the binary excess and an examination of the intrinsic brown dwarf binary fraction based on the possible presence of overluminous , unresolved sources in current parallax samples .",
    "conclusions are summarized in @xmath12  6 .",
    "the empirical multiplicity sample used here is similar to that constructed in @xcite , and is based on results from high resolution imaging studies using the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) and ground - based adaptive optics instrumentation @xcite .",
    "these studies were chosen as they represent a relatively uniform set of observations in terms of angular resolution ( limits of 0@xmath13050@xmath131 ) and imaging sensitivity .",
    "the selection criteria for sources imaged in these programs vary , but nearly all are composed of objects identified in color - selected , magnitude - limited surveys based primarily on 2mass , denis and sdss data .",
    "it is therefore assumed that , to first order , these data collectively constitute a magnitude - limited sample .",
    "of course , there is no single magnitude limit nor filter band to which that limit corresponds that spans the entire sample .",
    "as i will show in @xmath12  4.2.3 , this detail appears to be relatively unimportant in the resulting binary fraction distribution .    for all of the sources observed in these imaging studies ,",
    "spectral types were determined from published optical classifications for l0l8 dwarfs ( on the @xcite scheme ) and near - infrared data for l9t8 dwarfs ( on the @xcite and @xcite schemes ) .",
    "this division in classification stems partly from the wavelength regimes over which the l and t dwarf classes have been defined , and specifically the current absence of a robust near - infrared classification scheme for l dwarfs ( see @xmath123.5.2 ) .",
    "additionally , few of the l dwarfs in these samples have reported near - infrared spectral data , while nearly all of them have been observed at optical wavelengths .",
    "conversely , while all of the t dwarfs in these samples have been classified on the @xcite near - infrared scheme , few have been observed in the optical @xcite . in cases where the near - infrared spectrum of a source indicated a spectral type of l9 or later , such as the l7.5/t0 sdss j042348.57 - 041403.5 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter sdss  0423 - 0414 ) , the near - infrared classification was retained .",
    "several sources in the @xcite hst sample required significant revisions to their reported classifications ( @xmath143 spectral types ) or were rejected given the absence of any published spectral data .",
    "care was also taken to identify redundant sources between the samples .",
    "finally , although the l2 dwarf kelu  1 was unresolved in hst observations by @xcite , more recent observations by @xcite and @xcite have revealed this source to be binary , and is included as such in the sample .",
    "table  [ tab_bindata2 ] lists binary fractions for the full sample in groups of integer subtypes , including 90% and 95% confidence intervals based on the formalism of @xcite .",
    "while the overall sample is fairly large ( 32 binaries in 162 systems ) , significant uncertainties arise for individual subtypes due to small number statistics .",
    "the data were therefore binned into four spectral type groups , l0l3.5 , l4l7.5 , l8t3.5 , and t4t8 , chosen so as to minimize counting uncertainties while still sampling major spectral subgroups .",
    "there is a clear increase in the fraction of binaries from early - type l to the l / t transition , peaking at @xmath15 = 0.33@xmath16 for the latter grouping .",
    "binaries are roughly twice as frequent amongst l / t transition objects as compared to the earliest - type l dwarfs and latest - type t dwarfs .",
    "however , even with the prescribed binning , uncertainties due to small number statistics do not rule out a constant binary fraction of 0.200.24 at the 90% confidence level .",
    "nevertheless , the simulations described below will demonstrate that a binary excess amongst l / t transition objects is an expected feature of the local brown dwarf population .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite have proposed that the frequency of binaries amongst l / t transition objects is a natural consequence of the properties of brown dwarfs in general . in order to properly investigate this hypothesis ,",
    "it is therefore necessary to reproduce the empirical sample as observed . to do this ,",
    "several basic assumptions were required .",
    "first , as nearly all l and t dwarfs known reside in the immediate vicinity of the sun , it was assumed that the distribution of these objects is spatially isotropic .",
    "it was also assumed that the entire population arises from a single underlying mass function ( mf ) and age or birth rate distribution , as described in @xmath12  3.2 .",
    "third , only single sources and binaries were modeled .",
    "higher - order systems ( triples , etc . )",
    "make up only 3% of all very low mass multiples currently known @xcite , and are therefore a negligible population for the purposes of this study .",
    "fourth , the modeling of binaries assumes a fixed overall binary fraction ( @xmath17 ) and mass ratio distribution ( @xmath18 , where @xmath19 m@xmath20/m@xmath6 ) .",
    "while there is evidence that the binary fraction of stars decreases across several stellar classes @xcite , no trend has been established within the substellar regime .",
    "fifth , while simulated populations were initially constructed in terms of space densities , they are re - sampled to reproduce a magnitude - limited sample in order to investigate systematic effects and make direct comparisons to the empirical data ( see @xmath12  3.6 ) . finally , it is assumed that all binaries generated by the simulation are unresolved .",
    "this constraint arises from the observation that nearly all field l and t dwarf binaries identified to date have apparent separations less than 1@xmath21 @xcite is currently known , the l1.5+l4.5 pair 2mass j15200224 - 4422419ab @xcite . a handful of wide binaries with late - type m dwarf primaries and l or t dwarf secondaries",
    "are also known @xcite .",
    "] , below the angular resolution limits of 2mass , denis and sdss . hence , a given magnitude - limited sample selected from these surveys consistents entirely of singles and unresolved multiples .",
    "the first step of the simulation , generation of a population of low mass stars and brown dwarfs , was done using the monte carlo code described in @xcite .",
    "briefly , this code generates a large set ( @xmath22 ) of sources with randomly assigned masses and ages chosen from the mf and age distributions .",
    "these sources are then assigned luminosities and t@xmath3s according to a set of evolutionary models , in this case from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the distribution of luminosities can be compared to an observed luminosity function to constrain the underlying mf and birth rate ( e.g. , burgasser 2001 , 2004 ; allen et al .",
    "2005 ) . here",
    ", the derived luminosity functions provide a starting point for examining the distribution of spectral types for single and multiple sources .",
    "the input parameters for the simulation are listed in table  [ tab_parameters ] .",
    "power - law forms of the mf , @xmath23(m ) @xmath24 m@xmath25 , with @xmath26 = 0.0 , 0.5 , 1.0 and 1.5 were examined ; as well as the log - normal distribution of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also miller & scalo 1979 ) . a fixed mass range of 0.01 to 0.1  m@xmath27 was assumed .",
    "the lower mass limit is below the typical range of masses that comprise field l and t dwarfs @xcite , while the upper limit is constrained by the maximum mass incorporated in the evolutionary models .",
    "note that the @xcite and @xcite models use non - grey atmospheres and include condensate opacity as boundary conditions but not in the emergent spectral energy distributions ( so - called `` cond '' models ; @xcite ) .",
    "spectral models based on this assumption are largely consistent with the properties of mid - type m and mid- and late - type t dwarfs @xcite ; but are generally inconsistent with those of late - type m and early - type l dwarfs in which condensate opacity is important @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite found @xmath210% difference in the evolution of luminosity and t@xmath3 between models that incorporate photospheric condensate dust and those that do not . this is a relatively small deviation given current empirical constraints on the brown dwarf field luminosity function @xcite and binary fraction distribution ( table  [ tab_bindata2 ] )",
    "hence , evolutionary tracks that incorporate condensate opacity were not included in the simulations .",
    "the age distribution for the simulations assumes a constant birth rate over the past 0.1 - 10  gyr .",
    "b04 have demonstrated that significant deviations in the resulting luminosity function occur only for extreme forms of the birth rate , e.g. , exponentially declining star formation rates or short star - forming bursts .",
    "these forms are generally inconsistent with the observed continuity in the galactic mf between low- and high - mass stars ; formation rates , kinematics and spatial distributions of planetary nebulae , white dwarfs and regions ; nucleosynthesis yields ; and the metallicity and activity distributions of g and k stars @xcite .",
    "simulations with different minimum ages ( 0.1 , 0.5 and 1  gyr ) showed no significant differences in the output distributions ( see @xmath28  4.1.4 and 4.2.5 ) .",
    "the metallicities of the simulated sources were assumed to be fixed at solar values , again a constraint of the available evolutionary models .",
    "number densities from the simulations were normalized to the field low - mass star ( 0.11.0 m@xmath27 ) mf of @xcite , @xmath23(m ) = @xmath29 pc@xmath30 m@xmath31 , implying a number density of 0.0037 pc@xmath30 over the range 0.090.1 m@xmath27 .",
    "because all of the distributions are scaled by this factor , adjustment to refined measurements of the low - mass stellar space density can be readily made .",
    "once a sample of sources was generated and luminosities derived , spectral types were assigned using an @xmath32/spectral type relation based on empirical measurements . the data  from @xcite for unresolved m6t8 field dwarfs , and from @xcite ; and @xcite for the components of the brown dwarf binaries epsilon indi bab , kelu 1ab and sdss j1021 - 0304ab , respectively  are shown in figure  [ fig_mbol ] , and are restricted to sources with @xmath32 uncertainties @xmath330.2  mag . as in the binary sample described in @xmath12  2 , spectral types for the 32 sources in this plot are based on the optical scheme of @xcite for the l dwarfs ( with the exception of the kelu  1ab components ; see @xcite ) and the near - infrared scheme of @xcite for the t dwarfs .",
    "figure  [ fig_mbol ] also delineates a sixth - order polynomial fit to these data , with coefficients listed in table  [ tab_fits ] .",
    "this fit , which has a scatter of 0.22  mag , does not include measurements for the overluminous t dwarfs sdss j125453.90 - 012247.4 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter sdss  1254 - 0122 ) and 2mass j05591914 - 1404488 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter 2mass  0559 - 1404 ) .",
    "despite being unresolved in high - resolution imaging observations @xcite , these sources are sufficiently overluminous for their spectral types that they are likely to be closely - separated binary systems ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see @xmath12  5.2 ) .",
    "furthermore , were these two sources included in the fit , the resulting @xmath32/spectral type relation would be non - monotonic , obviating the ability to assign spectral types for a given luminosity .",
    "as it is , the @xmath32 relation exhibits a remarkable flattening between types l8 and t4 , decreasing by less than 0.5  mag over this spectral type range .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the small change in luminosity and t@xmath3 previously ascertained across the l / t transition .",
    "an alternative method for assigning spectral types is to use the simulated effective temperatures .",
    "there have been several studies on the t@xmath3/spectral type scale for field l and t dwarfs ; however , all of these rely on an assumed radius ( or distribution of radii ) or spectral modeling , and deviations between these methods have been noted @xcite . because bolometric luminosity measurements do not require any further theoretical assumptions , use of an @xmath32/spectral type relation was favored .",
    "binary systems were incorporated by selecting @xmath34 of the simulated sources as primaries , and creating secondaries with the same ages and masses assigned according to the mass ratio distribution .",
    "binary fractions spanning 0 @xmath35 0.7 were examined , as well as two forms of @xmath18 : a flat distribution and an exponential distribution , @xmath36 , where @xmath37 = 4 .",
    "the latter form derives from statistical analyses of the observed distribution of very low mass stellar and brown dwarf binaries , which exhibits a strong peak for equal - mass systems @xcite .",
    "luminosities , effective temperatures and spectral types were assigned to the secondaries in the same manner as the primaries . to facilitate computation ,",
    "secondaries were forced to have masses greater than the minimum mass sampled by the evolutionary models ( 0.01  m@xmath27 ) .",
    "again , for brown dwarfs with l and t dwarf luminosities , this constraint had a negligible effect on the final distribution of secondaries .",
    "the binaries generated in these simulations have combined light spectra determined by the relative contributions of their primary and secondary spectral types .",
    "as the absolute magnitude / spectral type relations of l and t dwarfs are distinctly non - linear @xcite , and as the evolution of spectral features across this range is complex , the composite spectra were simulated explicity .",
    "this was done by combining near - infrared spectral templates selected from a large library ( 88 sources ) of l and t dwarfs observed with the spex spectrograph @xcite in low - dispersion prism mode .",
    "details on the acquisition and reduction of the spex prism data are described in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also cushing et al .",
    "2003 and vacca , cushing & rayner 2003 ) .",
    "the full library will be presented in a future publication .",
    "the spectral templates chosen are listed in table  [ tab_standards ] and their spectra shown in figure  [ fig_standards ] . selection of t dwarf templates was straightforward , as they were simply chosen from the primary and secondary spectral standards from @xcite .",
    "l dwarf near - infrared spectral standards , on the other hand , have not yet been defined .",
    "furthermore , substantial variance amongst the near - infrared spectra of l dwarfs with identical optical classifications has been noted @xcite . these variations likely arise from differences in the abundance of condensates in the photospheres of l dwarfs , which is dependent on and/or augmented by surface gravity , metallicity and rotational effects @xcite . as it is beyond the scope of this study to investigate these effects in detail ,",
    "l dwarf spectral templates were conservatively chosen as sources with @xmath38 colors close to the mean of their spectral subtype @xcite , and with no obvious spectral peculiarities or significant deviations between published optical and near - infrared classifications .",
    "three of the l dwarf templates are optical spectral standards in the @xcite classification scheme .",
    "three other l dwarf templates are binaries , but with components that have similar magnitudes and photometric colors @xcite .",
    "finally , an l9 standard , 2mass j03105986 + 1648155 @xcite was included as a tie between the l and t dwarf classes ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . as shown in figure  [ fig_standards ] , these spectra vary smoothly in the evolution of the most dominant spectral features , including h@xmath6o , co and ch@xmath7 absorption and overall spectral color .",
    "the spectral templates were then calibrated to absolute fluxes according to an adopted absolute magnitude scale .",
    "three mko @xmath39/spectral type relations and two @xmath40/spectral type relations were examined . the primary relation used in the simulations",
    "was derived by fitting an eighth - order polynomial to @xmath39 data based on photometry @xcite and parallax data @xcite for 26 unresolved field l and t dwarfs with combined uncertainties @xmath330.2  mag ; and component absolute magnitudes for the binaries epsilon indi bab @xcite , kelu 1ab @xcite , sdss j0423 - 0414ab and sdss j1021 - 0304ab @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig_absk ] displays these data and the polynomial fit , which has a dispersion of 0.26  mag ( coefficients are listed in table  [ tab_fits ] ) .",
    "again , the overluminous sources 2mass  0559 - 1404 and sdss  1254 - 0122 were excluded from the fit .",
    "the other absolute magnitude / spectral type relations were taken from @xcite , based on fits to the absolute magnitudes of field sources excluding either known ( `` l06 '' ) or known and possible binaries ( `` l06p '' ; see @xmath12  5.2 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig_absk ] compares the three @xmath39/spectral type relations .",
    "the most significant differences between these lie in the l8 to t5 range , over which the two relations of @xcite differ by @xmath11  mag .",
    "the polynomial fit derived here is intermediate between these two relations .",
    "the @xmath40/spectral type relations considered here are illustrated in figure  4 of @xcite .",
    "once the template spectra were scaled to their respective absolute magnitudes following standard techniques ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , composite spectra were created by adding the templates that bracketed the assigned spectral types of the binary components , weighted accordinglyl1 + 0.3@xmath41l2 + 0.3@xmath41t4 + 0.7@xmath41t5 . ] .",
    "examples of composite spectra for various combinations of primary and secondary spectral types are illustrated in figure  [ fig_hybrid ] .",
    "for binaries with large differences in their component spectral types , composite spectra can differ substantially in their spectral characteristics from the underlying standard sequence .",

    "were generated in each simulation , an automated classification scheme was required after experimenting with various techniques , it was determined that classification by spectral indices provided the most efficient and accurate method .    for t dwarfs , classification by indices",
    "is straightforward , as @xcite have defined five near - infrared indices ( h@xmath6o - j , ch@xmath7-j , h@xmath6o - h , ch@xmath7-h and ch@xmath7-k ) which track monotonically with t spectral type . for the l dwarfs ,",
    "several near - infrared indices have been defined and compared against optical types @xcite , the most successful of which are tied to the h@xmath6o absorption bands . however , a robust classification scheme for l dwarfs in the near - infrared is still lacking , which can lead to problems particularly at the l / t transition @xcite .",
    "i therefore examined the behavior of the @xcite indices for both l and t dwarf spectra from the spex prism library , as shown in figure  [ fig_indices ] . following the convention of the empirical binary sample ,",
    "spectral types for l0-l8 dwarfs are based on optical data while those for l9-t8 dwarfs are based on near - infrared data .",
    "there are strong correlations for three of these indices  the two h@xmath6o indices and ch@xmath7-k  that are roughly monotonic across full spectral type range .",
    "ch@xmath7-j and ch@xmath7-h are strongly correlated only in the t dwarf regime .",
    "fourth - order polynomial fits to the indices were made where correlations were strongest , and coefficients are listed in table  [ tab_fits ] .",
    "spectral types for the composite spectra were determined from these spectal index relations , as follows .",
    "first a spectral type was estimated from the h@xmath6o - j , h@xmath6o - h and ch@xmath7-k indices . if these indices indicated a t spectral type , or if ch@xmath7 absorption is present at @xmath42-band ( indicated by ch@xmath7-h @xmath44 0.97 ) , subtypes based on the ch@xmath7-j and ch@xmath7-h indices were also computed .",
    "the individual index spectral types were then averaged to derive an overall classification for the composite .",
    "figure  [ fig_hybrid ] lists the classifications derived for the binary combinations shown there .    to determine the robustness of this method , the l and t dwarf spex spectra used to derive the index relations were reclassified by the above technique and compared to their original classifications .",
    "figure  [ fig_classcomp ] illustrates this comparison and typical deviations .",
    "overall , spectral types derived from the indices agree with published values to within 0.6  subtypes , although the scatter is greater amongst l0-l8 dwarfs ( 0.9  subtypes ) than l9t8 dwarfs ( 0.3  subtypes ) or l8t4 dwarfs ( 0.4  subtypes ) .",
    "these deviations likely arise from the same photospheric condensate variations that have inhibited the identification of near - infrared l dwarf spectral standards @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , figure  [ fig_classcomp ] indicates an overall accuracy of 0.5 - 1.0 subtypes can be attained for both l dwarfs and t dwarfs using a common set of spectral indices .",
    "once the parameters for all single and composite systems were derived , the simulated population was resampled into integer spectral type bins to derive distributions in number density and binary fraction .",
    "these distributions were normalized according to the assumed space density ( @xmath12  3.2 ) , yielding a `` volume - limited '' sample .",
    "the resulting number densities were then converted to surface densities for a magnitude - limited sample by computing effective volumes for each system , @xmath45 @xcite , where @xmath46 is the adopted limiting magnitude and @xmath47 the absolute magnitude of the system ( i.e. , the absolute magnitude of a single source or the combined light magnitude for a binary system ) .",
    "for all simulations , @xmath46 = 16 was adopted as a proxy .",
    "surface densities to this magnitude limit were then computed as the sum of effective volumes over a given spectral type range , @xmath48 where the numerical factor provides units of deg@xmath49 .",
    "a total of 58 separate simulations were run to sample the various input parameters listed in table  [ tab_parameters ] . from each simulation ,",
    "volume - limited space densities , magnitude - limited surface densities , and binary fraction distributions ( for both volume - limited and magnitude - limited cases ) as a function of primary , secondary and systemic ( singles plus composite binaries ) spectral type were constructed . in the comparisons that follow ,",
    "the baseline simulation is based on the @xcite evolutionary models , a power - law mass function with @xmath26 = 0.5 , @xmath50 = 0.1 , the exponential mass ratio distribution , and the @xmath39/spectral type relation derived in @xmath12  3.5.1 .      while the focus of this study is the binary fraction distribution of l and t dwarfs ,",
    "several clues into its origin can be gleaned from examining the number density ( for the volume - limited case ) and surface density ( for the magnitude - limited case ) distributions and their dependencies on various underlying parameters .",
    "results from representative simulations are provided in tables  [ tab_sptdist ] and  [ tab_sptdistmag ] .",
    "figure  [ fig_sptvsmf ] plots the distribution of singles sources ( i.e. , for @xmath50 = 0 ) as a function of spectral type for volume - limited and magnitude - limited samples and the five mass functions examined .",

    "the shape of these distributions is similar in form to the simulated field brown dwarf luminosity functions of @xcite and @xcite , and arises from the combination of long - lived stellar - mass early - type l dwarfs ( which accumulate over the 10  gyr of the simulation ) , the rapid cooling rate of substellar - mass l dwarfs ( reducing the number of late - type l dwarfs ) and the slow cooling rate of late - type t dwarfs ( increasing their numbers ) .",
    "the dip at t0t2 is enhanced by the flattening in the @xmath32/spectral type relation over this range , which spreads the luminosity function thinly at these spectral types .",
    "in addition , mass functions with @xmath51 preferentially produce lower - mass brown dwarfs and hence contribute to the rise in number density amongst the lowest - luminosity brown dwarfs .",

    "the log - normal mass function produces a distribution intermediate between the @xmath26 = 0.5 and 1.0 distributions .",
    "the number density of l0l9 ( t0t8 ) dwarfs in these simulations range over 0.0060.011  pc@xmath30 ( 0.0090.03  pc@xmath30 ) for @xmath26 = 0 to 1.5 ; i.e. , there are 50250% more t dwarfs than l dwarfs in a given volume for the mass functions examined .",
    "the number density of l / t transition objects , l8t4 , range over 0.00180.004  pc@xmath30 for @xmath26 = 0 to 1.5 , and are thus comparatively rare .",
    "in the magnitude - limited case , the number density decline from mid - type l to early - type t combined with the decrease in absolute @xmath43-band brightness over this range results in a steep decline in surface densities , by a factor of @xmath1120 - 200 from l0 to t1 depending on the underlying mf .",
    "surface densities then increase by @xmath16070% over types t1t4 , driven by both the increase in number densities and the flattening of the @xmath39/spectral type relation over this spectral type range . beyond t4",
    ", surface densities again drop as the @xmath39/spectral type relation steepens .",
    "the intrinsic brightness of l dwarfs implies that there are 5080 times more of these objects than t dwarfs in a given magnitude - limited sample , in stark contrast to the ratio of number densities.4.5:1 , largely reflects preferential efforts toward searches of later - type sources .",
    "if both classes were investigated to similar ( @xmath43-band ) magnitude limits , perhaps 5000 - 8000 l dwarfs would be known . ] again , steeper mass functions result in more l and t dwarfs , by roughly the same factor as the volume - limited case .",
    "figure  [ fig_sptvscomp ] compares the spectral type distributions of primaries , secondaries and systems ( singles plus binaries ) in both volume - limted and magnitude - limited cases . the only clear difference seen between the primary and systemic number density distributions in the volume - limited case is a 10 - 15% increase in the number of t0t2 dwarf systems .",
    "this deviation increases for higher binary fractions , and while relatively small nevertheless has a significant impact on the binary fraction distribution .",
    "for the magnitude - limited distribution , the contribution of binaries in the surface densities of t0t2 dwarfs increases substantially , by @xmath160% for @xmath50 = 0.1 , implying that 40% of these objects are binary .",
    "this is consistent with the observed binary fraction for these spectral types ( table  [ tab_bindata2 ] ) .",
    "increasing the underlying binary fraction raises the entire surface density distribution in the magnitude - limited case , as the overluminous , unresolved binaries are sampled to larger distances and greater volumes . however , the largest increase is consistently seen in the surface densities of t0t2 dwarfs , reaching a factor of 4 increase for @xmath50 = 0.5 .",
    "the shape of the number density distribution of secondaries in figure  [ fig_sptvscomp ] closely follows that of the primaries and composites , but is scaled roughly by the underlying binary fraction .",
    "there is a slight increase in the relative numbers of t dwarf secondaries , an artifact of the constraint that secondaries have equal or lower masses than their primaries .",
    "since m dwarf primaries are not modeled here , there is an artificial deficit of l dwarf secondaries .",
    "this bias is greatly enhanced in the magnitude - limited case .",
    "interestingly , the number of t dwarf secondaries is substantially larger than the number of primaries in this case , by a factor of 3 or more for spectral types t4 and later and @xmath50 = 0.1 .",
    "the vast majority of these secondaries are low mass companions to l dwarfs , as their relative infrequency ( lying on the tail of the power - law mass ratio distribution ) is outweighed by the much larger number of brighter l dwarf primaries in a magnitude - limited sample . a significant fraction of these systems consistent of old , low - mass stellar ( l dwarf ) + brown dwarf ( t dwarf ) pairs whose components straddle the hydrogen burning limit .",
    "these results indicate that , for a given magnitude limited sample , many more t dwarfs may be found as companions to higher mass brown dwarfs and/or stars than as isolated objects , although uncovering these companions may be nontrivial .      the spectral type distribution of a magnitude - limited survey is naturally influenced by the underlying absolute - magnitude relation . as illustrated in figure  [ fig_sptvsabsmag ]",
    ", the most significant differences found in these simulations are largely constrained to l / t transition objects , where the three absolute magnitude / spectral type relations considered here vary appreciably .",
    "most pertinent are the differences between simulations based on the two @xmath39/spectral type relations of @xcite , which differ by up to a factor of 2 - 5 over the l8t5 range .",
    "this is consistent with the @xmath11  mag difference between these relations , implying a factor of @xmath14 increase in volume sampled .",
    "the large differences in the surface densities imply that a complete magnitude - limited sample of l / t transition objects can provide a robust constraint on the underlying absolute magnitude relation .",
    "similar results are also found between different @xmath40/spectral type relations .",
    "figure  [ fig_sptvsabsmag ] also illustrates the differences between @xmath9-band limited and @xmath43-band limited samples .",
    "surface density distributions in the former case show considerably more structure , with more pronounced local minima and maxima at types t0 and t5 , respectively .",
    "this reflects the color shift between l dwarfs and t dwarfs ( from red to blue @xmath53 colors ) , the sharper turnover in @xmath40/spectral type relations across the l / t transition ( cf .",
    "figure  4 in @xcite ) and the increase in number densities beyond t0 ( figure  [ fig_sptvsmf ] ) .",
    "several factors considered in the simulations contributed minimally to the overall shape of the number density and surface density distributions .",
    "these include the different minimum ages for the field population examined , spanning 0.01 to 1  gyr , which only served to decrease the number of early - type l dwarfs by @xmath4415% .",
    "this is consistent with the results of @xcite , which demonstrated that only extreme modulations of the birthrate change the luminosity function of brown dwarfs appreciably .",
    "the two evolutionary models examined also produced similar spectral type distributions , with small deviations amongst early - type l dwarfs arising from different hydrogen - burning minimum masses derived by these models ( 0.075  m@xmath27 for burrows et al .",
    "1997 versus 0.072  m@xmath27 for baraffe et al .",
    "constant and exponential mass ratio distributions produced nearly identical spectral type distributions for @xmath50 = 0.1 , although 30% differences in the surface densities of t0t4 systems are seen for @xmath50 = 0.5 . just as an increase in the underlying binary fraction increases the total effective volume sampled for a given subclass , the exponential mass ratio distribution , which favors equal - mass / equal - brightness binaries , samples a larger effective volume than a flat mass ratio distribution .",
    "however , this effect is considerably smaller than the increase in number and surface densities ( particularly amongst l / t transition objects ) incurred by an increase in the underlying binary fraction . while all of these differences between the simulations are statistically significant , they are considerably smaller than current empirical uncertainties for l and t dwarf number and surface density measurements @xcite , and can be considered negligible for the purposes of this study .",
    "binary fractions as a function of spectral type were computed by ratioing the number of binaries within a given systemic spectral type range to all simulated sources within that same range .",
    "results from representative simulations for both volume - limited and magnitude - limited cases are given in tables  [ tab_bfdist ] and  [ tab_bfdistmag ] , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig_bfvscomp ] displays the binary fraction distribution as a function of systemic spectral type for the baseline simulations . for",
    "both volume - limited and magnitude - limited samples , there is a considerable degree of structure in these distributions , deviating significantly from the underlying flat form . the largest jump is seen amongst t0t2 dwarfs , over which binary fractions increase by a factor of two in the volume - limited case .",
    "the remaining low - level structure , of order 3050% , likely arises from composite spectral classification errors or , in the case of l0l1 dwarfs , endpoint effects",
    ". however , these are significantly smaller than the strong peak in the binary fraction distribution at types t0t2 .    in the magnitude - limited case ,",
    "all binary fractions are consistently higher , a well - understood bias incurred by the larger volume sampled by overluminous , unresolved pairs . and intrinsic binary fraction of 0.1 implies an apparent binary fraction of 0.19 , a factor of roughly two increase . ] for the most part",
    ", this bias merely serves to enhance the structure seen in the volume - limited distribution and , most importantly , the fraction of binaries amongst t0t2 dwarfs , which rises to 0.43 .",
    "this result was anticipated by the increase in the surface density distribution between systems and singles as noted in @xmath12  4.1.2 ( figure  [ fig_sptvscomp ] ) .    that the fraction of binaries amongst t0t2 dwarfs is higher in a volume - limited sample suggests that the _ intrinsic _ binary fraction of early - type t dwarfs is higher .",
    "however , it is important to make a distinction between the binary fraction distribution of systems and that of primaries . the latter exhibit a flat distribution in both the volume - limited and magnitude - limited cases , consistent with the assumed fixed underlying binary fraction .",
    "a more appropriate conclusion is that early - type t dwarf _ systems _ are more frequently binary , when such systems are unresolved .",
    "figure  [ fig_bfvsdata ] compares the magnitude - limited binary fraction distribution as a function of systemic spectral type to the binned empirical data of table  [ tab_bindata2 ] .",
    "the agreement between these for the baseline parameters is quite remarkable .",
    "the steady rise in the binary fraction between early - type l dwarfs and l / t transition objects , the peak of the distribution in the latter case , and the subsequent drop in the binary fraction for the latest - type t dwarfs are all faithfully reproduced in both form and magnitude .",
    "figure  [ fig_bfvsdata ] also illustrates how the binary fraction distribution varies with the assumed underlying binary fraction , @xmath50 .",
    "it is seen that while increasing @xmath50 increases the scale of the distribution , it has little effect on its shape ; in particular , the relative number of binaries between l / t transition objects and early - type l or later - type t dwarfs .",
    "comparison between these distributions and the empirical data enable a constraint on @xmath50 . by linearly interpolating the distributions as a function of @xmath50 and minimizing the uncertainty - weighted deviations between the data and simulation results , a best fit @xmath54",
    "= 0.11 was found , with ranges of 0.090.15 ( 0.080.17 ) acceptable at the 90% ( 95% ) confidence levels .",
    "these values are fully consistent with earlier estimates of the volume - limited , resolved binary fraction of l and t dwarfs , also ranging over 0.090.15 @xcite .",
    "it is important to remember that @xmath54 is the underlying _ resolved _ binary fraction , having been constrained by observations of resolved systems .",
    "the difference between this and the _ intrinsic _ binary fraction of brown dwarfs is discussed further in @xmath12  5.2 .      a somewhat larger modulation of the apparent binary fraction distribution is seen when different mass ratio distributions are considered , as illustrated in figure  [ fig_bfvsqdist ] . a flat mass ratio distribution results in a 20 - 30% decline in the binary fraction distribution across the full spectral type range , in both the binned and unbinned cases .",
    "again , this decline is consistent with the reduction in effective volume sampled by the reduced fraction of equal - mass / equal - brightness systems for a magnitude - limited survey .",
    "figure  [ fig_bfvsabsmag ] illustrates that a simulation using a flat mass ratio distribution and @xmath50 = 0.14 produces a binary fraction distribution that differs by less than 10% from the baseline simulation .",
    "indeed , the empirical data constrain a best fit @xmath54 = 0.14 and acceptable ranges of 0.120.19 ( 0.110.21 ) at the 90% ( 95% ) confidence limits in the case of a flat mass ratio distribution , somewhat higher than that derived using an exponential distribution .",
    "this degeneracy between the mass ratio distribution and the underlying binary fraction implies that the former can not be robustly constrained by the binary fraction distribution without an independent determination of @xmath50 .",
    "figure  [ fig_bfvsabsmag ] illustrates how the binary fraction distribution varies for different underlying absolute magnitude distributions . despite the substantial effect that the absolute magnitude relation has on the surface density distribution of l8t5 dwarfs ( figure  [ fig_sptvsabsmag ] ) ,",
    "the impact on the binary fraction distribution is considerably smaller . between the l06 and l06p @xmath39/spectral type relations , binary fraction distributions",
    "differ by less than 20% for individual subtypes , and by less than 10% when the spectral types are binned according to the empirical data .",
    "there is a comparably small difference between binary fraction distributions generated by the @xmath40/spectral type relations of @xcite , and also between @xmath9- and @xmath43-band magnitude - limited samples .",
    "these comparisons indicate that the binary fraction distribution , and more importantly the binary excess at the l / t transition , are relatively insensitive to the details of how a magnitude - limited sample is constructed .",
    "this justifies the incorporation of several high - resolution imaging samples into a single magnitude - limited probe of the binary fraction distribution .    a more important conclusion to draw from these comparisons , however , is that the observed binary excess does not appear to be an artifact of magnitude - limited imaging samples , since the parameters that most influence the surface densities of l and t dwarfs ( the absolute magnitude scale and limiting filter band ) have little bearing on the binary fraction distribution .",
    "indeed , as already pointed out in @xmath12  4.2.1 , a magnitude - limited sample simply amplifies the excess present in the underlying population .      as with the number and surface density distributions , several of the parameters explored in these simulations had minimal influence on the binary fraction distribution .",
    "neither the form of the mass function , choice of evolutionary model or minimum age of the population had more than a 5% effect on the structure or magnitude of the distribution .",
    "out of all of the parameters varied , only @xmath50 significantly influences the binary fraction distribution and only by scaling the entire distribution up or down .",
    "the structure of the distribution  i.e. , the excess of binaries amongst l / t transition objects  must arise from some other aspect of the simulation . as discussed below",
    ", it appears that the luminosity scale is exclusively responsible for this excess .",
    "the simulations presented here reproduce remarkably the relatively high binary fraction of l / t transition brown dwarfs . yet",
    "how does this binary excess arise ? both @xcite and @xcite proposed that the similarity of the composite spectra of l + t dwarf binaries to early - type t dwarf spectral morphologies , and the rapid evolution of single brown dwarfs through the l / t transition , may be the underlying causes . a detailed examination of the simulations presented here support these hypotheses .",
    "first , the composition of l / t transition binaries in the simulations is quite distinct as compared to other spectral subclasses , as illustrated in figure  [ fig_primspt ] .",
    "most binaries have composite types similar to their primaries , reflecting both the preference for equal - mass / equal - luminosity systems in the exponential mass ratio distribution and the dominance of the primary in the combined light spectrum of systems with low - mass companions .",
    "yet binaries classified as l9t3 dwarfs consistently have earlier - type primaries , up to @xmath10.6 subclasses on average , while 15 - 20% of t0t2 systems have primaries at least one subclass earlier .",
    "this is consistent with studies of known l / t transition binaries , 70% of which have been shown or inferred to be l dwarf plus t dwarf pairs @xcite .",
    "such pairs readily mimic the spectral appearance of an early - type t dwarf .",
    "the flattening of the absolute magnitude scale across the l / t transition allows the t dwarf secondaries of these systems to contribute significantly to the overall spectral flux at near infrared wavelengths .",
    "thus , a wide variety of component combinations result in a composite spectral energy distribution similar to an early - type t dwarf ( cf .  figure  [ fig_hybrid ] ) .",
    "second , a rapid evolution of brown dwarfs across the l / t transition can be deduced from the flattening of the luminosity scale over this range . based on the evolutionary models of @xcite and the @xmath32/spectral type relation shown in figure  [ fig_mbol ] , a 0.05  m@xmath27 ( 0.03  m@xmath27 ) brown dwarf dims from type l8 to type t3 in @xmath1600  myr ( @xmath1100  myr ) , a period spanning 30% ( 20% ) of its lifetime at that stage . in comparison",
    ", a brown dwarf of similar mass spends 2 - 3 times longer cooling from l0 to l8 , and a full 7  gyr ( 3  gyr ) cooling thereafter to the end of the t spectral class . since single brown dwarfs",
    "spend relatively little time at the l / t transition , they are much rarer than earlier - type and later - type brown dwarfs in a given volume ( figure  [ fig_sptvsmf ] ) . yet",
    ", combinations of these other spectral types , even for small binary fractions , can be comparable in number to single l / t transition objects , resulting in the perceived binary excess .",
    "these two explanations for the high rate of binaries amongst l / t transition objects are in fact related to a single underlying cause : the flattening of the luminosity scale . the small decline in @xmath32 across the l / t transition directly translates into small changes in the absolute magnitude scale over this range , and is the root cause of the rarity of single l / t transition objects .",
    "consider then the reverse argument : _ the observed excess of binaries at the l / t transition is further evidence of a flattening in the luminosity scale .",
    "_ indeed , the agreement between the shape of the simulated binary fraction distribution and empirical data , which is largely independent of all other parameters besides the @xmath32/spectral type relation , suggests that the luminosity scale of brown dwarfs across the l / t transition is indeed quite flat , and that brown dwarfs must traverse this transition over a relatively short period .",
    "this lends support to suggestions that the complete removal of photospheric condensate dust between late - type l and mid - type t , which appears to be largely responsible for the changes in spectral morphology across this transition , is relatively rapid and may require dynamic , nonequilibrium atmospheric processes .      in @xmath12  4.2.2 , a constraint on the underlying resolved binary fraction , @xmath54 ,",
    "was made by comparing simulated binary fraction distributions to high - resolution imaging results .",
    "however , imaging can not identify binaries that have very small separations or systems observed when the components are aligned along the line of sight ( e.g. , kelu  1ab ; @xcite ) .",
    "the existence of very tight brown dwarf binaries in the field is likely , as the separation distribution of resolved systems peaks at or near the resolution limit of current imaging surveys @xcite .",
    "@xcite , analyzing the results of the first searches for spectroscopic brown dwarf binaries @xcite , have suggested that the true binary fraction of brown dwarfs may be as high as 0.45 when selection effects are considered .",
    "similarly , @xcite and @xcite have inferred binary fractions of 0.30.5 for very low mass stars and brown dwarfs in two young open clusters based on the identification of overluminous sources in the color - magnitude diagram .    for field brown dwarfs , particularly l / t transition objects , the identification of overluminous , unresolved binaries is made difficult by uncertainties in the absolute magnitude relation , as well as intrinsic scatter arising from age , surface gravity and radius differences .",
    "nevertheless , @xcite hypothesized that a substantial fraction of l7t5 dwarfs with parallax distance measurements  10 of 15 sources ( 0.66@xmath55% )  are either resolved or unresolved binaries , due to their outlying position on the t@xmath3/spectral type relation of @xcite .",
    "taking this suggestion at face value , and assuming that the current parallax sample is essentially magnitude - limited ( i.e. , ignoring additional selection effects ) , the fraction of known and possible binaries over this spectral type range implies @xmath50 = 0.38 , with an acceptable range of 0.240.53 ( 0.210.59 ) at the 90% ( 95% ) confidence level , assuming = 0.42 , with 0.270.57 ( 0.240.62 ) acceptable at the 90% ( 95% ) confidence level . ]",
    "this is substantially higher than the fraction inferred from high - resolution imaging surveys , and suggests that up to twice as many brown dwarf binaries remain unresolved in these surveys . indeed , since counting overluminous sources includes only those binaries with similar - mass companions , the intrinsic binary fraction may be higher still .",
    "this result is seemingly consistent with the high brown dwarf binary fraction proposed by @xcite .",
    "care must be taken in interpreting this value since the number of l7t5 dwarfs with parallax measurements is small , uncertainties in several of the parallax measurements large , the underlying absolute magnitude distribution poorly constrained and hence the identification of overluminous sources highly uncertain . however ,",
    "if the absolute magnitude scale is relatively flat across the l / t transition , and the apparent fraction of binaries high , a measure of the fraction of overluminous sources in this spectral type regime may provide a more robust constraint on the true binary fraction of all brown dwarfs than high - resolution imaging surveys .",
    "the primary results of this study are as follows :    * the binary fraction excess observed amongst l / t transition objects has been successfully reproduced by mass function simulations incorporating the construction and classification of unresolved binary systems .",
    "it is found that this excess arises largely from a flattening in the @xmath32/spectral type relation , which significantly reduces the number of single l / t transition objects in a given volume while also causing l dwarf + t dwarf pairs to mimic the spectral properties of early - type t dwarfs .",
    "while the binary excess is particularly pronounced in magnitude - limited samples ( hence its detection in current high resolution imaging studies ) , it is not caused by selection biases , but is instead intrinsic to any sample of unresolved brown dwarf systems . * the shape of the binary fraction distribution depends weakly on the underlying absolute magnitude / spectral type relation , mass function and minimum age of the field population ( up to 1  gyr ) .",
    "the underlying binary fraction , @xmath50 produces the greatest effect , scaling the distribution but not significantly affecting its shape .",
    "there is a slight degeneracy between the influence of @xmath50 and the mass ratio distribution on the scale of the binary fraction distribution for a magnitude - limited sample . *",
    "the surface density of l / t transition objects in a magnitude - limited sample is highly sensitive to the underlying absolute magnitude / spectral type relation .",
    "number and surface densities also scale with the underlying mass function , but are largely insensitive to the minimum age of the field population or the mass ratio distribution of brown dwarf binaries . * empirical results constrain the underlying resolved binary fraction to 11@xmath0% ( 90% confidence interval ) , consistent with prior estimates",
    ". the true binary fraction , which includes sources unresolved in imaging studies , may be as high as 40% based on the fraction of apparently overluminous l7t5 dwarfs as proposed by @xcite .",
    "however , this result requires a more robust assessment of the absolute magnitude scale , and understanding a selection effects in the current parallax sample , and more ( and improved ) parallax measurements of l / t transition objects .",
    "the simulations presented here provide new insight into the relationship between the fundamental properties of brown dwarfs ( luminosities , mass function , intrinsic multiplicity ) and the observed density , spectroscopic properties and multiplicity of l / t transition dwarfs .",
    "what they do not reveal is the physical mechanism that drives this transition .",
    "the dramatic change in spectral properties over a short evolutionary period is strong evidence that nonequilibrium dispersion of photospheric condensates must play an important , if not predominant , role .",
    "as new theoretical models address dynamical atmospheric effects that may be involved in condensate cloud evolution , continued empirical characterization of these sources  including improved multiplicity statistics through high - resolution imaging , spectroscopic monitoring , and parallax measurements  should be a priority .",
    "fortunately , the apparently high binary fraction of l / t transition objects implies that this remarkable evolutionary phase of brown dwarfs can be studied quite thoroughly , through resolved photometric and spectroscopic studies and long - term astrometric monitoring to measure component masses .",
    "these enigmatic systems may ultimately provide the most stringent empirical constraints on the properties of brown dwarfs in general .",

    "<S> high - resolution imaging has revealed an unusually high binary fraction amongst objects spanning the transition between the l dwarf and t dwarf spectral classes . in an attempt to reproduce and unravel the origins of this apparent binary excess , i present a series of monte carlo mass function and multiplicity simulations of field brown dwarfs in the vicinity of the sun . </S>",
    "<S> these simulations are based on the solar metallicity brown dwarf evolutionary models and incorporate empirical luminosity and absolute magnitude scales , measured multiplicity statistics and observed spectral templates in the construction and classification of composite binary spectra . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to providing predictions on the number and surface density distributions of l and t dwarfs for volume - limited and magnitude - limited samples , these simulations successfully reproduce the observed binary fraction distribution assuming an intrinsic ( resolved ) binary fraction of 11@xmath0% ( 95% confidence interval ) , consistent with prior determinations </S>",
    "<S> . however , the true binary fraction may be as high as 40% if , as suggested by liu et al . </S>",
    "<S> , a significant fraction of l / t transition objects ( @xmath166% ) are tightly - bound , unresolved multiples . </S>",
    "<S> the simulations presented here demonstrate that the binary excess amongst l / t transition objects arises primarily from the flattening of the luminosity scale over these spectral types and is not inherently the result of selection effects incurred in current magnitude - limited imaging samples . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the existence of a binary excess can be seen as further evidence that brown dwarfs traverse the l / t transition rapidly , possibly driven by a nonequilibrium submergence of photospheric condensates . </S>"
