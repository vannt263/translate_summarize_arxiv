    "we know that there is no hadamard state on the kerr black hole space - time with the defining features of the hartle - hawking vacuum of respecting the isometries of the space - time and being regular everywhere  @xcite .",

    "the concensus in the literature is that the key property of the space - time which accounts for the non - existence of a true hartle - hawking vacuum is the presence of a region in which the killing vector which is parallel to the null generators of the horizon becomes spacelike . in the present article",

    "in addition , when the field is in this state the expectation value of the energy - momentum stress tensor as measured by an observer rigidly rotating with the horizon corresponds on the horizon to that of a thermal distribution at the hawking temperature rigidly rotating with the horizon .    the mirror serves to remove the superradiant normal modes , as can be seen heuristically by noting that amplified waves which would otherwise escape to future null infinity are reflected by it across the future horizon . in the specific case of a mirror of constant boyer - lindquist radius , we can explicitly construct a vacuum state whose feynman propagator has the symmetry properties identified in ref .",

    "although this conclusion appears to be valid irrespective of the radius of the mirror , we generalize a result due to friedman  @xcite to show that the space - time is unstable to scalar perturbations if the mirror does not remove all of the region outside the speed - of - light surface .",
    "this instability is characterized by the existence of mode solutions of the field equation with complex eigenfrequencies which we have neglected when quantizing the field . kang  @xcite has shown that the contributions made by these modes to the response function of an unruh box are not stationary but increase exponentially with time .",
