    "the advent in recent years of extremely deep imaging surveys , designed to probe distant galaxies through multiwavelength imaging extending deep into the infrared ( e.g. goods , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , has made possible studies of extremely faint , and often extremely red , sources . in order to target high redshift galaxies , colour cuts",
    "have been developed to exclude the majority of galactic stars - including the low metallicity dwarfs expected in the halo of our own galaxy .",
    "nonetheless , it has become clear that an unexpected number of extremely red stars remain at faint magnitudes .",
    "the spectroscopic component of high - redshift galaxy searches have confirmed the nature of such stars , in several cases obtaining deep spectroscopy as well as photometry , but the overall population has not been systematically characterised .",
    "low mass stars of class m or later comprise more than 80 per cent of the stellar population of our galaxy .",
    "faint stars of late - m , l and t classes probe the tail of the stellar mass function , bridging the divide between the main sequence and low mass brown dwarfs .",
    "such stars have unusual colours , arising from the presence of deep molecular absorption bands in their cool atmospheres .",
    "the faintness of these stars has made their investigation challenging , particularly with increasing distance from our sun .",
    "efforts to determine the properties of such stars in the halo and thick disk have concentrated on nearby stars with high proper motions indicative of a halo origin ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while deep surveys of the m star population in order to identify distant examples have been undertaken with wfpc2 on the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) , reaching @xmath3=23.2 @xcite , these have been limited to wavebands shortwards of 9000  where the coolest stars have very little flux .",
    "meanwhile , the more local population - late m stars at disk metallicities within 1.5kpc of the sun - have been the subject of detailed study in recent years .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is relatively shallow in the optical bands , reaching an @xmath4 band limit of @xmath5 .",
    "however , the addition of a redder @xmath6 band in the optical to similar depths has enabled the photometric selection of cooler , class l and t stars as sources with large flux decrements between adjacent passbands , caused by sharply - defined , strong absorption and transmission features .",
    "the @xmath6-band imaging also allows the characterisation of late m stars by their @xmath7 colour .",
    "such surveys have enabled templates based on thousands of local ( mainly disk ) dwarf stars to be constructed @xcite .    at the same time , advancements in infrared detector technology have made it increasingly easy to study these faint , cool stars at wavelengths longwards of the optical .",
    "their near and mid - infrared bands are dominated by molecular absorption , leading to extreme colours in infrared bands @xcite .",
    "again , such studies have been limited to local stars , in order to attain the maximum possible signal to noise .",
    "however , given the lower typical metallicity of stars in the halo when compared to the galactic disc , the characteristics of local disk - dominated m star samples may well be unrepresentative of fainter sources at larger distances and the colour selection methods applied locally might be expected to detect nothing at halo distances .    in this paper",
    "we present an analysis of faint low mass stars , selected for their extreme colours between two adjacent bands in high spatial resolution , deep optical imaging .",
    "such a colour selection is expected to select either relatively - nearby late m stars at sub - solar metallicities or near - solar metallicity early m stars at the large distances more normally associated with the galactic halo , if such a population exists .",
    "these two alternatives can not be distinguished on the basis of a single red colour , but can be explored using spectroscopy and photometry probing well into the infrared .    in section [ sec",
    ": photometry ] we present the data used in this analysis and we discuss the selection of stellar candidates in section [ sec : phot - sel ] . in sections",
    "[ sec : halo - pop ] and [ sec : spitzer - properties ] we discuss the optical and infrared properties of our sample , and in section [ sec : cooler ] we examine the photometry of cooler stars in the same fields . in section [ sec : spect ] we discuss existing spectroscopy of such faint stars , including a spectroscopic sample presented here for the first time , and spectroscopic abundance indicators that may hint at a typical metallicity for this population .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : halo - pop ] we discuss the interpretation of the overall properties of the faint , cool star population including their metallicity and distance distribution .",
    "all magnitudes in this paper ( optical and infrared ) are quoted in the ab system @xcite .",
    "we choose to use the ab system @xcite when expressing magnitudes in this analysis .",
    "the reason for this is twofold .",
    "firstly the ab system is widely used by extragalactic astronomy and the surveys that generate much of the deepest optical imaging , including the data discussed below .",
    "the ab magnitude scheme is also used in more local large spectroscopic samples such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "secondly , ab magnitudes are also constructed on a physical basis . a source flat in flux as a function of frequency ( f@xmath8 ) has zero colour in all bands .",
    "colours are calculated throughout this paper by convolving available observational and theoretical spectra with the filter transmissions concerned ( including the instrument and detector response ) to accurately account for filter - specific effective wavelengths and full - width half - maxima .",
    "our main reference spectra for faint stars the observationally - derived spectra of @xcite which were constructed for each subtype of class m and later stars from a total sample of over 700 observed spectra taken by the sdss . as figure",
    "[ fig : templates ] illustrates , these template spectra trace the same stellar locus as those of @xcite , although slight deviations are seen between the two template sets , particularly at late spectral types .",
    "use of the ab ( rather than vega ) magnitude system introduces a blueward shift of 0.43 magnitudes in the `` standard '' bessell @xmath9 colour , which accounts for the spectral slope of @xmath10 lyr at long wavelengths .",
    "in addition the @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) and @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) filter set has redder central wavelengths than their bessell filter counterparts , and the @xmath11 filter is broader than the `` standard '' @xmath15 as figure [ fig : filter_profiles ] illustrates .",
    "( @xmath12 , dotted ) , @xmath13 ( @xmath14 , dashed ) and @xmath16 ( @xmath6 , dot - dash ) wavebands , and of the @xcite @xmath15 ( dark grey ) and @xmath4 ( light grey ) filters .",
    "offset and plotted below is the spectrum of an m4 star . ]",
    "the analysis presented in this paper utilises two deep , multi - wavelength imaging surveys in order to combine their different strengths .",
    "the photometric selection of cool dwarf stars parallels that of high redshift galaxies in many respects . in both cases",
    "the accurate characterisation of the sources , and their reliable separation from other sources with similar optical colours , requires multiwavelength imaging spanning a long baseline from 5000  to 3.6@xmath1 m , and high angular resolution impossible to obtain from the ground without the use of adaptive optics .",
    "the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ) satisfies the requirements for such a selection .",
    "in addition to an abundance of auxiliary data , the survey comprises two primary data sets , optical and infrared , each of which surveys a field in the northern hemisphere ( goods - n ) and a second in the south ( goods - s ) .",
    "all goods data is publically released to the astronomical community in the form of fully reduced images .",
    "the optical ( 0.3 - 1@xmath1 m ) component of goods @xcite consists of deep optical imaging in the @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) , @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) , @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) and @xmath16 ( @xmath6 ) bands , each reaching depths @xmath19th magnitude as shown in table [ tab : depths ] , obtained using the wide field channel of the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) on the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) .",
    "the imaging has been drizzled to a pixel scale of 0@xmath2003 per pixel , with a point source fwhm of 0@xmath2005 in the @xmath14 band .",
    "in addition , the goods team have made publically available catalogues of the source photometry and properties in each field , generated using the sextractor software package , and with detection parameters tuned to the survey depth and resolution . in this analysis",
    "we utilise the kron - radius based automatic magnitudes reported by sextractor ( i.e. mag_auto ) .",
    "these magnitudes follow the curve of growth of the source profile , and are equivalent to a corrected aperture magnitude for an unresolved source .",
    "we use version r1.1 of the goods catalogues .",
    "the second primary dataset generated by the great observatories origins deep survey comprises deep _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "infrared ( 3 - 10@xmath1 m ) imaging of the fields targeted by _ hubble _ @xcite .",
    "the irac instrument was used to survey the goods fields at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8.0@xmath1 m , with a pixel scale of 1.2@xmath21/pix to a depth @xmath2226th magnitude in the first two bands and @xmath2224th magnitude at longer wavelengths as shown in table [ tab : depths ] . as discussed in section [ sec : spitzer - properties ] , confusion is a significant issue for sources at the faint magnitudes of our targets , and in imaging of this depth . as a result ,",
    "the 12 arcsecond ( 10 pixel ) apertures recommended for irac photometry in sparse fields seldom escape confusion in the goods images .",
    "@xcite determined that smaller apertures with a diameter of 4.5 arcseconds were suitable for compact sources in the goods images , and could be reliably corrected for flux in the wings of the point spread function .",
    "we apply the same prescription for aperture magnitudes as @xcite , correcting to total magnitudes using the offsets given in table [ tab : depths ] .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     -drop stars in the goods field .",
    "the decline in number counts at bright magnitudes arises both due to the small volumes probed at bright magnitudes and due to the potential saturation of brighter sources in the deep goods imaging .",
    "there is no obvious decline in the number of sources seen at faint magnitudes .",
    "each field surveys an area of 150 arcmin@xmath23 . ]",
    "the selection of stars by photometric methods relies on a combination of the red optical spectrum that arises from a cool blackbody with the abrupt absorption edges of metal molecules . in the absence of significant metal enrichment ,",
    "the colours of stars at a given temperature are likely to be less extreme since the strength of molecular features is reduced .",
    "hence a sample of faint stars based on extreme colours in two adjacent bands is expected to select either relatively - nearby late m stars at low metallicities as well as near - solar metallicity early m stars at the large distances more normally associated with the galactic halo , if such a population exists .",
    "the @xcite ` nexgen ' models and the kurucz atlas9 models @xcite remain the most recent stellar atmosphere models to attempt the temperature and metallicity regime of interest here ( although the atlas9 models in fact do not survey t@xmath243500k late m stars and do not account for the important cah bands in cool stellar spectra ) .",
    "as the recent analysis by @xcite shows , neither provides a satisfactory fit to the spectra of cool stars . while the marcs spectra produce a somewhat better fit , the publically available library only extend as cool as 4000k .",
    "in practise , no stellar models can reliably reproduce the colours of cool stars .",
    "on the other hand , there exist a number of published extreme cool stars known to be at significantly sub - solar metallicity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "unfortunately the photometry and/or spectral coverage of these observations inevitably covers too short a wavelength range to reliably calculate @xmath12 , @xmath14 and @xmath6 colours simultaneously from the empirical spectra .    as a result , while we tentatively consider the results of available model templates as well as empirical spectra , we caution the reader that such results should not be considered reliable .",
    "we note that future interpretations of this population would benefit from improved modelling and interpretation of these faint stars in the red spectral region ( @xmath228000 ) accessible to red - sensitive spectrographs .",
    "we have determined the optical colours expected for cool stars , in the same filter set employed by the goods survey , over a range of metallicities .",
    "we use the m - star spectral models of @xcite over the range [ fe / h]=0 . to -4.0 ( where such models are available ) and at four different temperatures : t=2000k , 2500k , 3000k and 3500k .",
    "figure [ fig : metallicity ] illustrates the colours predicted by the ` nextgen ' models , and compares these with the colours of the sdss dwarf star templates derived by @xcite which are dominated by nearby disk stars and the photometric sample derived in section  [ sec : phot - sel ] .",
    "it is clear that while the @xmath25 colour fails to distinguish between different metallicity populations , the addition of an @xmath7 colour may provide a crude measure of metallicity .",
    "we note that a slight offset ( approx 0.1 magnitudes in @xmath7 ) appears to be required to match the model spectra to the observed near - solar , old disk stellar sample at bright magnitudes .",
    "given the uncertainties in current models of m star atmospheres , we compare their predictions with observational data on galactic globular clusters .",
    "observational evidence for the @xmath7 ( or more generally @xmath26 ) colours of cool stars as a function of metallicity seems to be poor .",
    "however the @xmath9 colours of such stars ( observed in the johnson - cousins or bessell systems and in vega magnitudes ) have been reported from observations of several globular clusters . while few observations probe deep enough to identify the base of the main sequence ( as opposed to the main sequence turn - off )",
    ", some observations of low metallicity globular clusters have characterised the main sequence ridge to very faint magnitudes .",
    "ngc 6397 is one such cluster , with a metallicity of [ fe / h]=-2.0 and lying at a distance of 2.2kpc @xcite .",
    "the main sequence in this source has been observed with _",
    "hst_/acs down to a limiting magnitude of @xmath27 ( vega ) and",
    "is seen extending redwards to @xmath28 , the theoretical hydrogen - burning limit at this metallicity @xcite . at our colour cut of @xmath25=1.7 ( approximately @xmath29 ) ,",
    "the main sequence in this cluster corresponds to an observed magnitude of approximately @xmath30 ( vega ) , or an absolute magnitude limit of 12.4 in the i band , while our detection limit of @xmath0 would only select sources with @xmath31 .",
    "this cutoff in apparent magnitude implies that we are only sensitive to approximately class m4-m5 stars at the distance and metallicity of ngc 6397 @xcite and would not expect to select any stars with halo metallicities at greater distances .",
    "this emphasises that our colour cut allows only for a narrow range of low metallicity objects which are sufficiently red and sufficiently bright to meet our colour selection criteria .    in figure",
    "[ fig : globulars ] we illustrate the effects of decreasing metallicity on the main sequence colours of globular clusters with published photometry . as discussed above ,",
    "ngc 6397 is a distant globular cluster with the low metallicity expected of halo stars .",
    "by contrast ngc 6366 and ngc 6144 are two clusters with [ fe / h]=-0.58 and [ fe / h]=-1.7 respectively , and published main sequence star photometry to faint magnitudes observed with hst / acs @xcite as part of an acs survey of globular clusters .",
    "while these data are amongst the deepest available , they do not reach the red colours , and hence faint @xmath15-band magnitudes of the m stars of interest here . nonetheless , it is interesting to note that the well - defined main sequence in these globular clusters marks a gradual shift to bluer @xmath9 colours with decreasing metallicity , and all three are bluer than the old - disk stars measured by the sdss .     and @xmath32 bands .",
    "the data in ngc 6144 and ngc 6366 become unreliable redwards of approximately @xmath33    the spectra of several very low metallicity extreme subdwarfs in the field have now been published . @xcite",
    "demonstrate the effects of decreasing metallicity on the optical spectra of late m dwarfs .",
    "the weakening of metal oxide bands at 7200 , 7900  and 8500  with decreasing metallicity boosts stellar flux in the @xmath14 and @xmath6 bands .",
    "in particular , the deep 7900  absorption feature in the spectra of cool stars at disk metallicities suppresses the @xmath14-band magnitudes of these sources .",
    "decreasing metallicity removes this suppression , boosting the @xmath25 colour of these sources while decreasing their colour in @xmath7 .",
    "while none of the published extreme subdwarfs have published @xmath6-band photometry , synthetic colours calculated from the @xcite spectra indicate that at these low metallicities , late m dwarfs are approximately 0.2mag bluer in @xmath7 than typical old - disk m stars ( bessell , private communication ) .",
    "it is clear from the combination of theoretical and observed data that most stars earlier than m3-m4 will be omitted at low metallicities due to their blue colours , while later m class stars are only likely to be detected relatively nearby due to their faint magnitudes .",
    "thus our selection preferentially identifies stars with disk metallicities , while probing to halo distances .",
    "this analysis of our colour selection function is supported by the distribution of optical colours in our faint star sample as shown in figure [ fig : metallicity]b .",
    "the majority of stars have colours consistent with metallicities in the range @xmath34}<0 $ ] ( i.e. similar to that of the galactic disk ) .",
    "two stars in the goods - n field show anomalously low @xmath7 colours ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 ) as might be expected at [ fe / h]@xmath22 - 2 , and both of these are relatively faint ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "comparison with the colours of the extreme subdwarfs of @xcite suggests that these might be identified as very low metallicity sources , although both are somewhat redder in @xmath25 than might be expected .",
    "either spectroscopy of these two blue stars , or optical photometry of known extreme subdwarfs will be required to make a more quantitative comparison .",
    "having identified the stars in hst data , we now consider the colours of these unresolved sources in the infrared with _ spitzer _",
    "goods data .",
    "the deep images are close to the confusion limit in the irac bands , and many of the @xmath12-drop sources are confused in the imaging . of a total of 124 @xmath12-drop stars in the goods fields we classify 48 ( 39% , figure [ fig : spitzer_examples ] case a ) as isolated , a further 36 ( 29% , figure [ fig : spitzer_examples ] case b ) as confused but potentially deblendable and the remaining 40 ( 32% , figure [ fig : spitzer_examples ] case c ) as hopelessly confused . in this analysis",
    "we use only isolated objects since the noise in deconvolved magnitudes at this level is often dominated by residuals from neighbouring objects rather than the target source .         the infrared colours of the remaining sample are shown in figures [ fig : spitzer_23v12 ] and [ fig : spitzer_14v23 ] , with the colours measured for m , l and t dwarfs in the same bands by @xcite shown for comparison . working some three magnitudes above the 3@xmath38 background limit , the errors in the colours are dominated by uncertainty in the aperture correction and are set to an indicative 0.1 mag in each band .",
    "the colours of cool stars in the infrared are dominated by the relative strengths of molecular absorption bands in their atmospheres , in particular those of ch@xmath39 in the 3.6@xmath1 m band , co in the 4.5@xmath1 m band and h@xmath40o in the 5.8@xmath1 m band .",
    "the infrared colours of our faint @xmath12-drop selected sources are very similar to those of the brighter population studied by @xcite , despite being fainter by some ten magnitudes .",
    "the goods @xmath12-drop stars extend slightly blueward of the bright sample in the [ 4.5]-[5.8 ] band , as would be expected given that our @xmath12-drop sample extends to earlier m subclasses than the bright sample ( m3/m4 as opposed to m5 ) .",
    "it is not clear from existing models or data whether a similar bluewards shift might be expected with varying metallicity .",

    "these fall into three categories ; a , b and c as described in section [ sec : spitzer - properties ] . ]",
    "while the bulk of the population has colours consistent with brighter m stars , a subset of seven sources are anomalous with m star optical colours and t star colours in the _ spitzer _ wavebands .",
    "these fall loosely into three categories .",
    "one source , labelled ` a ' on figure [ fig : spitzer_14v23 ] has colours consistent with a late - m / early - l classification within approximately 3@xmath38 of the photometric errors in both optical and infrared bands .",
    "the colours are also consistent with those expected for a close m / l binary system with the m star flux dominating the optical bands and the fainter l star contributing to the flux longwards of 3@xmath1 m .",
    "binary m / l and m / t systems have been observed at bright magnitudes in the past ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this source is towards the faint end of our sample , with @xmath41 .",
    "a binary with separation of 1@xmath21.09 at a heliocentric distance of 35 pc ( using the m / l binary pair of * ? ? ?",
    "* as a model ) would be unresolved at _ hst_/acs resolution at the distance of 1kpc estimated for an m6 star at this magnitude .",
    "if it is indeed a binary system then each component will be intrinsically fainter still and may lie at greater distances than estimated .",
    "radial velocity measurements of the system may be necessary to determine whether the star is an anomalous m dwarf or a binary pair .    a further three sources , labelled",
    "` b ' on figure [ fig : spitzer_14v23 ] have @xmath6 - 5.8@xmath1 m colours consistent with those of m stars but are anomalously bright in the 8@xmath1 m band . in one case ,",

    "we note that all of these anomalous sources defy straightforward explanation based on photometry alone and may benefit from spectroscopic analysis .",

    "here we consider two diagnostic features in the spectrum of m stars : the surface gravity dependent na i doublet at 8183 , 8195  and the metallicity dependent tio to cah ratio around 7000 .",
    "the na i doublet is a strong feature in the spectrum of m stars , but its measurement is complicated by the crowded spectrum around 8200  which makes the true continuum level difficult to determine . @xcite introduced a systematic measurement of the equivalent width of this line by defining a region to contain the line , and two adjacent regions as a proxy for the continuum level .",
    "this definition is shown in table [ tab : indices ] .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , this feature is a sensitive indicator of surface gravity for stars cooler than 3900k , and hence discriminates between dwarf stars with a surface gravity of @xmath53 and giant stars of the same spectral class with a typical surface gravity @xmath54 .",
    "giant stars of class m4 and later are rare , and not expected to substantially affect the number counts of faint stars , but the presence of a significant subpopulation of giants could theoretically impact our distance distributions ( which are based on distance modulus , assuming that the stars are dwarfs ) . as expected , the na i equivalent width of all eighteen spectra are entirely consistent with dwarf stars ( having ew@xmath55 ) , and inconsistent with those of m giants ( which would have an ew@xmath56 ) .",

    ", we consider the ratio of two molecular line indices .",
    "low metallicity dwarfs have lower ratios of cah to tio than higher metallicity dwarfs @xcite , allowing their ratio to be used as a crude metallicity indicator .",

    "there is little evidence for significantly sub - solar metallicities ( i.e. [ fe / h]@xmath57 - 2 ) . around 40% of the sample ( 7 of 18 )",
    "are consistent with slightly sub - solar metallicities ( i.e. [ fe / h]@xmath57 - 1 ) , while the same fraction are completely consistent with the indices for a local ( solar metallicity ) sample .",

    "two also show tio5@xmath58 suggesting that they are of spectral type m6 or later ( consistent with their photometric colours ) .",
    "we caution the reader that it is possible that these spectral indices may be affected by noise due to the subtraction residuals of night sky emission , and by night sky absorption , which is nt removed by our data reduction .",
    "spectroscopy aimed at identifying high redshift galaxies is routinely obtained in such a manner as to optimise night sky line subtraction . by offsetting the telescope between exposures , such that the target moves along the slit ,",
    "the frames can be combined during reduction in such a way as to produce a simultaneous measurement of the sky flux that can be subtracted from the object spectrum .",
    "the measured signal to noise on the spectra account for the error in the sky line subtraction , and hence given our requirement of a signal to noise exceeding ten , we estimate statistical error on our spectral indices of less than 15% .",
    "however , we note that the indices are measured in a spectral region affected by a weak skyline complex , and that our spectra are of comparatively low resolution .",
    "while we do not attempt further quantitative analysis of our spectra , we note that there are other spectral features that may be accessible even in these faint sources . in",
    "particularly , it may be possible in future to measure the metallicity using the ki doublet feature at 7700 .",
    "this doublet is observed to be extremely strong in the low metallicity extreme subdwarfs of @xcite . while the line is not as strong in early m dwarfs as in later subtypes , we note that our spectra appear qualitatively similar to those from the nearby near - solar metallicity with no sign of the enhancement in line strength that might be expected at low metallicities .",
    "the typical metallicity of the sample as derived from 18 spectra is consistent with that determined from their optical colours ( figure [ fig : metallicity]b ) . given that none of the eighteen stars in our spectroscopic sample are of very low metallicity ( [ fe / h]@xmath24 - 2 . ) , the fraction of significantly sub - solar sources in our photometric sample is likely to be small ( @xmath59% ) , consistent with the suggestion of two sources out of 124 ( @xmath60% ) based on their optical colours .",
    "= -1 , asterisks - [ fe / h]=-2 ) . ]",
    "given the evidence of their optical and infrared colours , combined with photometry of a number of examples , it appears that the m star population identified at faint magnitudes ( and hence in extragalactic surveys ) is relatively metal - rich ( [ fe / h]@xmath22 - 1 ) compared to the metal - poor halo population that might be expected to dominate star counts at large distance .",
    "in fact , their metallicities are more typical of those observed locally in the thick disk .",
    "this suggests that there is only a weak metallicity gradient in the class m and later dwarfs identified as photometric dropout sources , although this analysis does not exclude the possibility that a low metallicity m - star population also exists at faint magnitudes .",
    "given this relatively metal - rich population , it is possible to explore the comparison with brighter m stars further .",
    "as demonstrated by @xcite , for dwarf stars with metallicities [ fe / h]@xmath22 - 1 , @xmath7 colour increases linearly with subclass between spectral classes m3 and m9 , flattens through the early l dwarfs and then increases again . as a result",
    ", m stars identified as @xmath12-drops ( which are typically too blue in @xmath7 to be l stars ) can be crudely classified by their @xmath7 colours .",
    "we chose to use @xmath7 colour for this classification rather than @xmath25 for two reasons : in order to minimise errors on the colour , and in order to provide a second colour , thus beginning to constrain the sed for these sources . in the deep optical imaging employed here , the typical photometric errors on this colour are of order 0.05 mag , less than the measured variation of colours within each subclass in a brighter sample from the sdss ( determined by comparing spectral typing based on template fitting , spectral indices and photometric colour ) which is typically 0.2 mag in these filters,@xcite .",
    "this scatter in @xmath7 colour within subclasses arises from variation in physical properties of the stars in question .",
    "a continuum in the metallicity and temperature of individual stars will affect their line indices and photometry , leading to a gradual range of characteristics in a field population rather than the discrete set of subtypes that might be expected from a single age , single metallicity population such as a globular cluster .",
    "this uncertainty in intrinsic colour limits photometric classification to @xmath61 subclass .",
    "the surface density of faint stars decreases rapidly with increasing m star subclass , since a smaller volume is probed to the same magnitude limit . as a result stars in the range",
    "m4-m5 are expected to outnumber later classes .",
    "we make an approximate classification of our sample of @xmath12-drop m stars by assigning each to the closest subclass in typical colour , based on the templates of @xcite . as figures [ fig : data_n ] and [ fig : data_s ]",
    "illustrate , early m stars ( classes m3-m4 ) are found spanning the entire range from the saturation limit to the faintest magnitudes at which the goods data can distinguish unresolved sources from compact galaxies .",
    "later m stars ( spectral class m5 and later ) are intrinsically fainter and so our survey probes progressively smaller volumes with increasing subclass .",
    "these are not seen at bright magnitudes but become increasingly common at @xmath48 .",
    "the latest stellar class seen in our @xmath12-drop samples is m7 .",
    "stars of classes later than m7 are intrinsically faint and so will only be detected in a relatively small volume probed locally .",
    "in addition , the very red @xmath7 colours of these sources is likely to lead to them dropping below the limit of the @xmath14 band used for selection .",
    "later classes may be detected rather as @xmath14-band dropouts .",
    "we note that m3 stars should formally be too blue to be selected given our @xmath25 colour cut . as discussed above , classification by @xmath7 colour",
    "is at best an approximate method , and the large ` m3 ' sample may be explained as a combination of m4 stars with bluer than average @xmath7 colour and genuine m3 stars with a redder than average @xmath25 colour .",
    "spectral classification would be necessary to classify individual sources .",
    "interestingly these ` m3 ' sources are more numerous than the ` m4 ' sample suggesting that scatter in the @xmath7 colour is skewed to the blue rather than symmetrical which may be indicative of low metallicity as discussed in section [ sec : halo - pop ] .",
    "if so , a slight correction must be applied to the absolute magnitude of each subclass resulting in slightly lower estimated distances .",
    "however , while this will apply a systematic shift to the distribution of distance moduli , it will not change the distribution .",
    "as expected , the two probable low metallicity candidate @xmath12-drops in the goods - n field defy classification based on @xmath7 colour .",
    "using the typical absolute magnitude for each class ( as determined by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) we can estimate the distance modulus , and hence distance to each star , essentially using the relation between colour and absolute magnitude determined from the local disk population @xcite to derive a photometric parallax for each star in the sample .",
    "while this has traditionally been carried out using the @xmath15 vs @xmath9 relation , we chose instead to use @xmath14 vs @xmath7 ( in common with * ? ? ?",
    "* ) since these sources are brighter , and hence their magnitudes are more reliable , in the redwards bands .",
    "the distribution of source distances from the sun are shown in the right - hand panels of figures [ fig : data_n ] and [ fig : data_s ] .",
    "we are observing class m3-m4 stars at distances between 1 and 14kpc .",
    "the distant tail of this population is well above both the scale height of 275pc for the thin disk , and the 1.5kpc scale height of the thick disk that may be more appropriate for disc m dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the most extensive survey of faint m dwarfs to date has been a survey of high galactic latitude fields with _",
    "hst_/wfpc @xcite .",
    "these authors probed about 1400 stars , reaching a depth of @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "their finding of a sharp decline in the number of stars with a relatively short scale height of @xmath24 1kpc above the galactic disc @xcite seems inconsistent with our flat number counts out to a heliocentric distance of @xmath64kpc . clearly our sample is smaller by a considerable margin , but is also significantly deeper and hence highly complete ( @xmath2298% ) at large heliocentric distances .",
    "the fact that a similar distribution of number counts is observed in two widely separated fields argues against galactic substructure as an explanation .",
    "a flat number density of stars with increasing magnitude is not easily reproduced given standard models of the galactic density profile . in order to explore this , we constructed monte carlo simulations of a sample of 50 stars randomly drawn from a population of @xmath65 stars distributed according to a known density profile .",
    "profiles considered include the thick disc density law of @xcite which takes the form of a sech@xmath23(z / h ) law with a scale height h=300pc above the galactic disk and ` model b ' of @xcite which considers a composite model of thin disk and thick disc ( both with sech@xmath23 density profiles and scale heights of 350pc and 1.5kpc respectively ) together with a halo density profile ( scaling as approximately r@xmath66 with radius from the galactic centre ) .",
    "variations on these models were also considered with varied scaling between disc and halo components , and a variety of halo power laws . in each case , number counts are predicted to increase sharply at faint magnitudes , since the density law varies less rapidly than the volume element at a given magnitude .",
    "the absence of such an upturn suggests that this population is falling off more rapidly than those expected from standard disk profiles , despite extending many scale heights above the plane of the disk , or alternately that the conventional components of galactic structure need to be rethought .",
    "our results might be interpreted as suggest that either the scale height of the thick disk has been significantly underestimated ( as also suggested by @xcite ) or that a third distant but relatively metal - rich component is needed to explain the population .",
    "however , we do caution that our stellar number counts in the most distant bins are small and that analysis of larger deep surveys are needed .",
    "we note with interest that the presence of a large population of massive astrophysical compact halo objects ( machos ) that are faint in the optical and contribute up to 20% of the halo mass has been inferred from microlensing analyses .",
    "these sources have been inferred to have a mass of @xmath670.5m@xmath68 , similar to the mass of an early to mid m - dwarf star .",
    "according to the widely used ` s'-model @xcite , the macho objects occupy a spherical , isothermal halo of core radius 5kpc . in at least one case ,",
    "a lensing star has been confirmed photometrically and spectroscopically to be an m4 - 5 dwarf star , with a red colour similar to those discussed in this analysis ( @xmath69 ( vega ) , * ? ? ?",
    "while the m dwarf population studied here may explain only a fraction of the proposed macho mass contribution to the dark halo , we probe only a small subset of the halo m star population with the colour and flux limits applied in our study .",
    "we note that these cool , red stars would not easily be identified in the relatively shallow and blue monitoring imaging employed by the macho @xcite and eros collaborations .",
    "our survey also highlights both the utility and the difficulty of relying on the relatively small deep fields designed for extragalactic observations .",
    "while such surveys are extremely sensitive and benefit from multiwavelength observations - often including coordinated observations in the infrared and deep spectroscopic follow - up - they also suffer from being necessarily small in size .",
    "the newer generation of ground - based , wide - field imagers have enabled larger deep fields to be observed , but under seeing conditions that make the effective separation of stars and high redshift galaxies ( which become comparable in number density at faint magnitudes ) impossible .",
    "the variation of 40% in the m star number counts between the goods fields suggest that larger deep fields should be observed at _ hst _ resolutions in order to average out structure in the inner halo or outer disc",
    ".    clearly further work in larger fields with both deep and high resolution imaging ( e.g. cosmos , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is required to strengthen the observational result that the number density of sources remains constant to faint magnitudes , which may imply a rapid cut - off in the thick disk density profile at large distances above the galactic plane .",
    "we have investigated the properties of a faint population of m stars selected using a photometric drop method similar to that used to identify high redshift galaxies .",
    "the m - dwarfs in this study are up to five magnitudes fainter than those considered by previous authors , and hence lie at distances up to ten times further than those investigated before .",
    "this population extends well above the galactic plane , with little evidence for a decline in number at faint magnitudes / large distances .",
    "this is difficult to reconcile with models of known disk structure .",
    "the m - stars selected by this photometric method show similar colours to those within a kiloparsec of the sun , both in the optical and the infrared .",
    "together with the evidence from line indices , this suggests that there are significant numbers of m - stars with moderate to high metallicities extending well above the plane of the galaxy",
    ".    our sample of stars with @xmath70 should be complete for mid - m dwarfs of near - solar metallicity but is incomplete for low - metallicity m dwarfs many of which have bluer colours or are more distant .",
    "determining the metallicity of individual sources is difficult without exceptionally deep spectroscopy .",
    "if one or more of our sources are at low metallicity , they may be even cooler - and hence somewhat closer - than we believe , although our spectroscopic results indicate that fewer than 6% of m stars are likely to fall into this category .",
