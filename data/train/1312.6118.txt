    "the escape problem of a brownian particle from a meta - stable state is ubiquitous in many fields of science , such as chemical reaction of molecules @xcite .",
    "spin - torque - driven magnetization switching @xcite in nanostructured ferromagnets in the thermally activated region also belongs to this problem , which has been extensively studied because of its potential application to spintronics devices such as magnetic random access memory ( mram ) and magnetic sensor .",
    "the observation of the magnetization switching provides us important information , such as the retention time of the mram .",
    "more than a decade has passed since the first experimental and theoretical works on spin torque switching in the thermally activated region @xcite .",
    "the spin torque switching can be regarded as the brownian motion in the presence of a non - conservative force , contrary to the switching by magnetic field , which is a conservative force defined as the gradient of a potential .",
    "the lack of a general method to formulate the switching rate in the presence of the non - conservative force is an unresolved problem in statistical physics @xcite .",
    "therefore , many assumptions have been used in the previous theories of the spin torque switching @xcite .",
    "however , recent works @xcite have revealed the limits of the applicability of previous theories .",
    "for example , the switching rate has been assumed to obey the arrhenius law , @xmath3 , with linear scaling of the switching barrier , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath1 are the attempt frequency , the thermal stability , the current , and the critical current of the precession around the easy axis , respectively @xcite . however , the linear scaling is valid only in the low - current region @xcite , while a relatively large current has been applied in experiments @xcite to observe the switching quickly .",
    "the use of the linear scaling leads to an error of the estimation of the thermal stability @xcite .",
    "another issue is that the transition state theory previously adopted @xcite can not estimate the switching rate under a low damping limit @xcite , while the gilbert damping constant of materials typically used in spintronics application are very low @xcite , i.e. , @xmath8 .",
    "these facts prompted us to revisit the theory of spin torque switching in a thermally activated region .    in this paper , we study the spin - torque - switching rate of an in - plane magnetized system using the mean first passage time approach @xcite .",
    "the introduction of the effective energy density enables us to calculate the switching rate even in the presence of the non - conservative force .",
    "the switching rate showed a nonlinear dependence on the current in the high - current region ( @xmath0 ) on a logarithmic scale , where @xmath9 is the spin torque switching current at zero temperature .",
    "the attempt frequency was strongly suppressed around @xmath1 contrary to the assumption in previous experimental analysis that it remains constant @xcite .",
    "for example , the attempt frequency at @xmath1 was three orders of magnitude smaller than that at the zero current .",
    "the theoretical approach presented in this paper is useful for the escape problem of a brownian particle under a non - conservative force when the magnitude of the non - conservative force is much smaller than that of the conservative force .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    ", we assume that the magnetization dynamics is well described by the macrospin model .",
    "the macrospin assumption is , at least for the grand state , guaranteed by the spin torque diode experiment @xcite in which the oscillation frequency of the free layer magnetization agrees with the ferromagnetic resonance frequency derived by the macrospin model .",

    "figure [ fig : fig1 ] ( b ) schematically shows the constant energy curves of @xmath20 in @xmath21 space .",
    "the in - plane magnetized system has two low - energy regions around the energy minima at @xmath22 corresponding to @xmath23 .",
    "these two low - energy regions are separated by the saddle point @xmath24 at which the energy density @xmath25 .",
    "we named the low - energy region , @xmath26 , around @xmath27 as region 1 ( 2 ) .",
    "the area outside regions 1 and 2 corresponds to the high - energy region .",
    "the magnetization dynamics is described by the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation with the random torque , @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the gyromagnetic ratio and the gilbert damping constant , respectively .",
    "the spin torque strength , @xmath31 , consists of the current @xmath7 , the spin polarization @xmath32 , and the volume of the free layer .",
    "the components of the random field , @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) , satisfy the fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xcite , @xmath35 , where the diffusion coefficient @xmath36 consists of the boltzmann constant @xmath37 , and the temperature @xmath38 .    during the switching between the regions 1 and 2 , the magnetization precesses on the constant energy curve around the easy axis .",
    "the precession period is determined by the anisotropy fields , @xmath17 and @xmath39 , and is typically on the order of 1 ns @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the switching time is determined by the damping , the spin torque , and the random field , and is on the order of 1 @xmath40s-1 ms , depending on the current magnitude @xcite .",
    "such long time scale of the switching is due to the fact that the correlation function of the random torque , which induces the switching , is proportional to the small parameter @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the precession period on the constant energy curve is much shorter than the switching time . also , because of the large demagnetization field due to the thin film geometry , as soon as the energy exceeds the saddle points energy , the magnetization moves from region 1 ( 2 ) to 2 ( 1 ) by the precession around the demagnetization field , and relaxes to region 2 ( 1 ) .",
    "therefore , the dominant contribution to the switching rate is the time climbing the potential well of region 1 or 2 .",
    "thus , we average the magnetization dynamics on the constant energy curve in regions 1 and 2 , and neglect the high - energy region .",
