    "the deep - inelastic scattering of electrons on a photon target is studied by measuring the two - photon reaction @xmath7 , tagged by the detection of one of the final - state electrons at a large four - momentum transfer @xmath8 ( figure [ fig : dis ] ) .",
    "the other electron usually escapes at a small scattering angle , thereby ensuring that the target photon is nearly on shell , @xmath9 ( _ single - tag events _ ) .",
    "sometimes it is detected at small angles , with a small four - momentum transfer @xmath10 ( _ double - tag events _ ) .",
    "the two virtual photons , with virtuality @xmath11 and @xmath12 , are referred to as the `` probe '' and `` target '' photons , respectively .    the differential cross section for the process @xmath13",
    "is given in ref.@xcite .",

    "can not be neglected ; consequently one can only measure an effective structure function @xmath38    the photon structure function has been measured at various @xmath2 values at the petra , pep and tristan accelerators @xcite and at lep @xcite . the structure function for double tag",
    "was first measured by the pluto collaboration@xcite . here",
    "we report on the analysis of events with @xmath2 in the range @xmath39 and @xmath4 either close to zero or in the range @xmath40 .",
    "the data were collected by the l3 detector during the years @xmath41 at @xmath42 with a total integrated luminosity of 120 @xmath43 .",
    "a new feature in the present work is a fit to two - photon kinematics imposed on each event .",
    "inputs to the fit are the measurements of the kinematic variables of the hadrons and of the scattered electrons , constrained to four - momentum conservation .",
    "the single- and double - tag cases are treated differently .    in the single - tag case , the event plane is taken to be the scattering plane , defined by the directions of the tagged electron and the beam . in the double - tag case , the event plane is defined by the direction of the vector sum of the momenta of the tagged electrons and by the beam direction .",
    "the components of the momentum vectors in the event plane are labelled @xmath44 and @xmath45 , parallel and perpendicular to the beam respectively ; @xmath46 is the component perpendicular to this plane .",
    "the positive @xmath47 direction is defined in the direction of the tagged electron . from the energy and momenta of the hadronic system , @xmath48 , of the scattered positron , @xmath49 , and of the scattered electron , @xmath50 ,",
    "three energy and momentum constraints are defined : @xmath51 the term @xmath52 describes the average energy carried away by unobserved initial state radiative photons ( isr ) . in the fit ,",
    "the following expression is minimized with respect to three components of the four - momentum vector of the hadronic system : @xmath53 four energy and momentum differences are defined as : @xmath54 where the index @xmath55 runs over all detected hadrons and @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 are the fit quantities .",
    "the @xmath59 error matrix , @xmath60 , of the hadronic energy measurement is calculated from the individual cluster energy and momentum measurements by taking into account errors in energy measurements and uncertainties in the hadron directions .",
    "the constraints @xmath61 are applied with constant weight factors @xmath62 .",
    "these weight factors reflect the accuracy of the measurements on the energies of the tagged electrons and the spread introduced by radiative corrections .",
    "the distribution of @xmath63 is not used in the fit but to compare the hadronic energy resolution between data and monte carlo .    in the single - tag case the unseen electron",
    "is assumed to have zero scattering angle .",
    "as one of the electron momenta is unknown , the constraints @xmath64 and @xmath65 are combined into : @xmath66    most two - photon monte carlo programs have no provision for isr .",
    "the value of @xmath52 , estimated by a program of berends , daverveldt and kleiss@xcite , is of the order of @xmath67 for a beam energy of @xmath68 .",
    "it increases logarithmically with the tagging angle . in fits to the data",
    "such losses are taken into account by using @xmath69 for the large - angle electron and @xmath70 for the small - angle electron in double - tag events .    before the fit the mean values of @xmath71 , with @xmath72 , are adjusted to zero by scaling the hadronic energies and momenta .",
    "the scale factor accounts for the average reduction in hadron energy from the loss of particles .",
    "the hadron energy resolution is estimated from the widths of the constraint distributions .",
    "the scaling procedure improves the measurement of the visible hadronic mass .",
    "the kinematic fit , applied to each event , determines the fitted value of the hadronic invariant mass and , for single - tag events , the energy of the unobserved electron , @xmath73 : @xmath74    the correlation between the generated values of @xmath75 and @xmath23 and their fitted values for single - tag events is displayed in figure [ fig : xmatrix - bst ] ; their relation is approximately linear .",
    "the kinematical fit improves the hadronic mass resolution by about 12% in single - tag events and by 30% in double - tag events .",
    "after the kinematical fit , the one sigma mass resolution is about @xmath76 for single - tag and @xmath77 for double - tag events ; the resolution in @xmath23 is 0.13 for single - tag and 0.10 for double - tag events .",
    "the resolution is constant in @xmath23 and @xmath78 in the ranges covered by the experiment .",
    "a detailed description of the l3 detector and its performance is given in ref .",
    "the analysis in this paper is based on the central tracking system , the high resolution electromagnetic calorimeters and the hadron calorimeters .",
    "the electron scattered at high @xmath2 is observed in the endcap electromagnetic calorimeter at a polar angle @xmath79 between 200 and 700 mrad with respect to the direction of one of the beams .",
    "the other electron remains either undetected or it is observed in one of the small - angle electromagnetic calorimeters in a fiducial region 29 mrad @xmath80 mrad .",
    "the hadronic energy and momentum and the visible mass are derived from the energy clusters in the electromagnetic and hadron calorimeters .",
    "energy clusters in the small - angle calorimeters are also included if their energy is less than @xmath81 .",
    "the single - tag events are accepted by two independent triggers , a charged particle track trigger @xcite and a calorimetric energy trigger@xcite .",
    "the average efficiency of the combination of both triggers , deduced from the data , is @xmath82% .",
    "it decreases to 85% at the lowest accepted visible hadronic mass of @xmath83 . for the double - tag events the energy trigger also accepts a small - angle electron in coincidence with one charged particle .",
    "this yields a trigger efficiency larger than 98% for double - tag events .",
    "the selection of the process @xmath84 has been guided by fully simulated event samples from several @xmath85 monte carlo generators .",
    "the jamvg@xcite @xmath85 generator is based on an exact calculation of the multiperipheral diagrams .",

    "phojet@xcite is an event generator , within the dual parton model framework .",
    "the photon is considered as a superposition of a `` bare photon '' and virtual hadronic states . to separate soft from hard processes , a transverse momentum cutoff at @xmath91",
    "is applied to all the partons of the pointlike interactions @xcite .",
    "twogam@xcite generates three different @xmath85 processes separately : the qpm , soft hadronic vdm and the qcd resolved photon contribution with a transverse momentum cutoff at @xmath91 .",
    "the dominant background processes are @xmath92 , simulated by jetset@xcite , @xmath93 simulated by koralz@xcite and @xmath94 , simulated by jamvg .",
    "single - tag hadronic events are selected as follows :    1 .",
    "the scattered electron candidate is an electromagnetic cluster with an energy greater than 30% of the beam energy .",
    "at least three tracks are seen in the central tracking system .",
    "3 .   the visible hadronic mass @xmath95 is greater than @xmath83 .",
    "4 .   the hadronic transverse momentum component , @xmath96 , is less than @xmath97 and + @xmath98 , where @xmath99 stands for the momentum of the tagged electron .",
    "the event rapidity , @xmath100 , must be greater than 0.4 , see figure [ fig : bstsel-7]a ; @xmath100 is defined by @xmath101 where @xmath102 runs over the calorimetric clusters , including that of the scattered electron .",
    "this requirement suppresses the annihilation reaction , where the total longitudinal momentum of the event is close to zero . in the two - photon reaction it can be of the order of @xmath103 because of the momentum of the unobserved electron .",
    "the @xmath104 probability in the kinematic fit is greater than @xmath105 .",
    "the momentum of the unobserved electron must be greater than @xmath106 .",
    "a thrust @xmath107 and a thrust axis @xmath108 are defined by maximising the linear sum of projected hadronic cluster momenta along @xmath108@xcite @xmath109 here @xmath110 refers to the hadronic cluster momentum in the @xmath85 centre - of - mass .",
    "a variable cut is applied on the maximum allowed value of the cosine of the electron - thrust angle in the @xmath85 centre - of - mass if the hadronic mass is greater than @xmath111 ; its value is 0.92 , 0.80 , 0.70 , 0.60 for masses smaller than 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 , respectively .",
    "this cut discriminates against the annihilation reaction , in particular it removes @xmath112 events , where the b - quark decays semileptonically . in that case",
    "the electrons are emitted predominantly in the thrust direction , whereas no such correlation is present in the two - photon reaction ( see figure [ fig : bstsel-7]b ) .",
    "double - tag hadronic events are selected in a similar way to single - tag events .",
    "the small - angle scattered electron candidate must have an energy greater than 40% of the beam energy , and no cut is applied to the event rapidity .",
    "table 1 shows the numbers of events selected in the range @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "the largest contamination in the single - tag sample comes from two - photon @xmath115-pair production .",
    "the influence of the annihilation background in single - tag events is checked by comparing the data taken at the z peak with the off - peak data ( 25% of the sample ) where it is about a factor three smaller than on the peak . within the limited accuracy",
    "the off - peak sample is consistent with the total selected sample .",
    "the data are compared to monte carlo expectations in table 1 and in figures [ fig : tcpc - bst ] , [ fig : xyqw - bst ] and [ fig : xyqp - bdt ] . in figure",
    "[ fig : tcpc - bst ] kinematic properties in the @xmath85 centre - of - mass of the selected single - tag events are compared in shape to monte carlo predictions . for this purpose",
    "the monte carlo distributions are normalized to the same number of events as the data . in [ fig : tcpc - bst]a ) the thrust exhibits a wide distribution , which is adequately described by jamvg ( qpm ) and less well by the phojet and twogam models . in [ fig : tcpc - bst]b ) and [ fig : tcpc - bst]c ) ( for @xmath116 ) the distribution of the cosine of the polar angle of the thrust direction with respect to the @xmath85 axis ( @xmath117 ) shows forward peaking in good agreement with the jamvg simulation .",
    "a diffractive forward peak , predicted by phojet and twogam , is not observed in the data .",
    "it should be noted that the compatibility of the qpm angular distributions with the data does not exclude the contribution from qcd processes , such as photon - gluon fusion and @xmath118 which have similar angular distributions@xcite , but indicates a low contribution of vdm and diffractive processes .",
    "figures [ fig : xyqw - bst ] a)@xmath119d ) show the distributions of @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 , together with monte carlo background estimations , for the selected single - tag events , in comparison with monte carlo predictions normalised to the data luminosity .",
    "although the number of events expected by jamvg is too small , the @xmath122 distribution follows the predicted shape .",
    "the hadronic mass @xmath123 presents an excess of data over jamvg predictions at masses above @xmath124 .",
    "the @xmath125 distribution is limited by the maximum mass observed , @xmath126 , and by the minimum mass of @xmath127 and by the restricted @xmath2 range from 40 @xmath3 to 500 @xmath3 .",
    "the data agree with the prediction of jamvg for @xmath128 . for lower @xmath120 values",
    "the qpm alone is insufficient to reproduce the data .",
    "the excess of events over the jamvg prediction at @xmath129 and @xmath130 is compatible with the existence of a qcd contribution in the measured @xmath2 range .",
    "twogam predicts too many events at all @xmath120 values .",
    "phojet agrees with the data at low @xmath120 , but not at high @xmath120 because this program suppresses also the qpm diagram with the cutoff on the quark transverse momentum ( @xmath131 ) .",
    "also the production is suppressed in phojet , whereas the jamvg program predicts a substantial charm contribution in both single- and double - tag events .",
    "the double - tag events have a negligible background from z - decay and @xmath115-pairs .",
    "figures [ fig : xyqp - bdt ] a)@xmath119d ) show the distributions for @xmath120 , @xmath132 , @xmath2 and @xmath4 , together with the monte carlo expectations . also here",
    "the qpm model implemented in jamvg predicts too few events , but the kinematic distributions , such as the thrust , the thrust angular distributions and the @xmath133 distribution of the energy clusters , are well reproduced .",
    "phojet and twogam expectations exceed the data at low @xmath120 values , thus indicating that the qcd contributions are overestimated .",
    "the jamvg generator reproduces the shape of the kinematic distributions .",
    "therefore it provides the basis for calculating the acceptance and it can be used to unfold the @xmath125 distributions to distributions in true values of @xmath23 .",
    "after subtraction of background , the single - tag data are divided in five @xmath125 bins , and unfolded into @xmath134 bins with the svd method@xcite . the unfolding procedure is considered to be satisfactory if the @xmath125 distribution , calculated from the unfolded result , reproduces the measured @xmath125 distribution within its statistical errors .",
    "the acceptance has a maximum of about 60% at @xmath135 and minima of about 40% at both ends of the @xmath23 interval .",

    "the qpm estimates that the structure function , calculated at the the mean value of the target photon virtuality @xmath142 , is only 0.2 % smaller than the value expected for a real photon , this effect is therefore neglected .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ fig : plot - fsingle ] and in table 2 .",
    "the correlation between the statistical errors , introduced by the unfolding procedure , is small .",

    "estimates of systematic uncertainties from various sources on each data point are summarized in table 3 , averaged over the entire @xmath23 and @xmath122 range .",
