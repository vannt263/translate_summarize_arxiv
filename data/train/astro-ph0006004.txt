    "it is currently known that accretion onto black holes can take four forms : the standard thin disk ( @xcite ) ; optically thin advection - dominated accretion flows ( adafs : @xcite , rees et al .",
    "1982 ; narayan & yi 1994 , 1995a , 1995b ; abramowicz et al .",
    "1995 ) ; optically thick adafs ( abramowicz et al . 1998 ) ; and geometrically thin disk with small advective and larger viscosity ( @xcite ) . the last form is thermally unstable ( @xcite ) , and therefore is unlikely to be considered viable for real flows .",
    "the other three forms are all thought to exist in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "evidence has been shown that some seyfert galaxies and qsos may accrete material via thin disk ( @xcite ) , while low luminosity agns ( llagns ) may accrete material via adafs at very low accretion rates and their continuum emission can be well explained by adafs ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "lasota et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and narayan ( 1996 ) proposed that in some luminous agns accretion may occur in an intermediate form , i.e. that the accretion flow consists of an outer standard disk and an inner adaf in between a transition radius @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath2 may be directly determined by the accretion rate : the higher accretion rate , the smaller @xmath2 until it reaches the last stable orbit .",
    "this idea has been successfully used to model the spectra of the soft- and hard - state of some lmxbs , which are thought to be a small scale version of agns ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . recent research on ngc4258 , m81 and ngc4579 also demonstrate the existence of this kind of two component flows in llagns ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . however , there are few examples for such an accretion configuration in luminous seyfert 1 galaxies , although the distribution of the x - ray spectral index against the accretion rate suggests that this two component flow may be common in seyfert galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "ngc4593 is a normal seyfert 1 galaxy with redshift @xmath3 .",
    "the mass of its central black hole is determined to be @xmath4 ( @xcite ) using the reverberation mapping method , which is believed to give a reliable mass estimation ( @xcite ) .",
    "the mass is also constrained to be @xmath5 if the observed redshift of the central component of h@xmath0 to the narrow line component is due to gravitational redshift ( @xcite ) .",
    "we adopt the mass as @xmath4 , and then the eddington ratio is estimated to be @xmath6 .",
    "in addition , ngc4593 is one of the objects which have been suggested to accrete material via an outer thin disk and an inner adaf ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is therefore very interesting to look in different bands for evidence of the existence of a truncated thin disk in ngc4593 .    in this letter",
    ", we compile the nuclear continuous emission of ngc4593 , and investigate the ouv continuum and the iron k@xmath0 line profile .",
    "evidence is shown that this object seems to be analogous to the object ngc4258 which accretes material via an outer thin disk and an inner adaf .",
    "at radio band , ngc4593 has been observed by vla at 3.6 cm , 6 cm and 20 cm .",
    "the radio emission comes from unresolved regions with extent less than 37pc at 6 cm and 20 cm ( @xcite ) , and 17pc at 3.6 cm ( @xcite ) .",
    "these can be used as upper limits to the nuclear emission since 37pc and 17pc are still too large to distinguish whether the emission comes from a disk or jet .",
    "the measurements have been obtained using iras in the far infrared band .",
    "however , iras has very poor spatial resolution with a beam @xmath7 .",
    "the measurements can only provide a poorly constrained upper limit to the nuclear emission because the galaxy contributes at least 50% to the measurements ( santos - lle et al .",
    "1995 ) .    in the ultraviolet - to - optical and j- , h- , k- and l - bands , santos - lle et al .",
    "( 1994 , 1995 ) have obtained the nuclear continuum emission within a campaign to monitor spectral variations of ngc4593 .",
    "they modeled and subtracted the contribution of the stellar population to the nuclear continuous emission , and also corrected for galactic extinction .",
    "the rosat spectrum shows that there is no significant intrinsic extinction in ngc4593 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the absolute uv fluxes are difficult to define owing to the flux variability . however ,",
    "the relative spectral shape did nt change much based on santos - lle et al .",
    "( 1994 , 1995 ) data .",
    "we adopt the mean flux in this letter .",
    "ngc4593 was observed by rosat at soft x - ray band .",
    "the spectrum can be fitted by a power - law with spectral index @xmath8 ( @xcite ) . in the hard x - ray ,",
    "asca observed ngc4593 three times ; we use the longest observation taken in 1994 in this letter .",
    "the continuum between 1.5 - 4.5kev and 7.2 - 10kev can be modeled by an absorbed power - law with spectral index @xmath9 ( see the data processing procedure in section 3 ) .",
    "we adopt @xmath10 , and then calculate the monochromatic luminosities .",
    "the sed are shown in fig  1 .",
    "there is a discontinuity between _ rosat _ and _ asca _ band which should be caused by the x - ray variability .",
    "previous observations by _ exosat _ have been revealed that the x - ray flux at 2 - 10kev band varies in a range of @xmath11 cgs ( @xcite ) , hence ngc4593 was in a `` high state '' when it was observed by _ asca _",
    "( with 2 - 10kev flux of @xmath12 cgs ) , while it was in a `` low state '' when _ rosat _ observed it ( with an extrapolated 2 - 10kev flux of @xmath13cgs ) .",
    "the sed of ngc4258 , which is compiled by chary et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , is also shown in fig  1 .",
    "it is surprising that ngc4593 has an almost identical infrared to hard x - ray sed shape ( at the `` low state '' ) with that of ngc4258 , although its luminosity is larger than that of ngc4258 by a factor of about 30 .",
    "the multi - band spectra of ngc4258 is well explained by a two component accretion flow model with a transition radius at 10@xmath14100@xmath15 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the radio - to - x - ray spectra might also be explained by such a model .      the emission from a thin accretion disk can be roughly modeled as a multi - color black body ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is independent of the microphysics of the disk and depends only on the mass of black hole @xmath16 , the accretion rate @xmath17 ( @xmath18 is the eddington accretion rate , @xmath19 is a dimensionless accretion rate ) and the inner edge of the disk @xmath20 if we specify the outer edge as @xmath21 ( @xmath22 is the gravitational radius ) of the disk and the inclination of the disk to the line of sight as @xmath23 .",
    "we first model the ouv continuum spectrum as emission from a standard thin disk extending down to the last stable orbit ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the dotted lines in fig  2 show the standard thin disk models with ( from top to bottom ) @xmath250.008 , 0.02 , 0.06 and 0.20 .",
    "none of these models is capable of explaining the ouv nuclear continuum emission .",
    "then , we model the ouv spectrum as emission from a truncated thin disk .",
    "the solid line in fig  2 presents the emission from a truncated thin disk model by setting @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "this model can fit the ouv nuclear continuum emission well . though it does not produce enough energy emission at the j- , h- , l- and k - band , this is not a serious difficulty because most of the near infrared emission is possibly emitted in an outer hot dust torus , which is illuminated by the inner uv - x - ray source ( with a total energy of @xmath28cgs in uv - x - ray band ; santos - lle et al .",
    "1995 ) but not the thin disk .",
    "in addition , the heating of the outer thin disk by the illumination of the central x - ray emission will change the ouv emission , but not much due to the small subtending angle of the central x - ray emission .",
    "if the above interpretation of the ouv nuclear continuum emission of ngc4593 is correct , this should be a good evidence for a a truncated disk in the nucleus .",
    "further observations and detail theoretical modeling of the whole spectra are needed .",
    "one distinct feature of a system with a truncated outer thin disk and an inner adaf is that there should not be a large relativistically broadened iron k@xmath0 line in the hard x - ray band . indeed , nandra et al .",
    "( 1997 ) presented a spectral fit with a gaussian model , and found that the iron k@xmath0 line is only moderately broad in ngc4593 .",
    "the narrowness of the line is consistent with an origin in a truncated outer thin disk and an inner adaf but not a thin disk extending down to the last stable orbit . in order to test this and determine the truncated radius from the x - ray emission , we have re - analyzed the data set of the longest observation taken in 1994 .",
    "the x - ray data have been processed with standard screening criterion . for sis data ,",
    "the faint mode data were converted to bright2 mode data and corrected for dark frame error and echo effects .",
    "hot flickering pixels were removed from the sis and rise - time rejection was applied to exclude particle events from the gis data .",
    "sis grade 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 data were selected for the analysis .",
    "the source counts were extracted from circular regions of radius @xmath293.5   and @xmath296   for the sis and the gis , respectively , while the background counts were extracted from a region near the source for the gis and from the uncontaminated region of the same ccd chip for the sis . for the sis spectrum , the response matrices appropriate for the date of the observation",
    "were made using the script _",
    "sisrmg_. for the gis spectrum , the 1994 response matrices were adopted .",
    "ancillary response files were made for each detector using _",
    "ascaarf_. the asca data preparation and the spectral analysis were performed using version 1.4 of the xselect package and version 10.01 of xspec .",
    "since we are only interested in the iron k@xmath0 line , only the portion of the spectrum between 1.5 to 10 kev are fitted to minimized the complex due to the ovii and oviii absorption edge in the warm absorber .",
    "the continuum between 1.5 - 4.5kev and 7.2 - 10 kev is modeled by an absorbed power - law .",
    "this fit yields a photon index @xmath30 , which is consistent with that obtained by nandra et al .",
    "the photon index is then fixed at this value for the following more complicated fit .    since the disk is truncated at some radius",
    ", the disk line emission does not extend into the last stable radius .",
    "we use a disk line model to describe this disk emission , but leave the inner radius as a free parameter .",
    "the outer disk radius is fixed at very large radius @xmath31 since the data suggests a large radius but does not constrained its value well . the line emissivity index ( @xmath32 )",
    "is fixed at @xmath33 as expected if the general disk is illuminated by a point source above the symmetry axis .",
    "the line energy is fixed at 6.4kev in the source rest frame , since the disk line is expected to arise from fluorescence .",
    "in addition to this disk component , line emission is also expected from the transition region between the outer thin disk and the inner adaf , where the gas temperature is high enough to ionize the iron to high ionization state but still not high enough to have the iron atoms fully stripped .",
    "this transition region might not be very thick , therefore we use a kepler rotating ring model to describe it .",
    "since this component is collisionally ionized and excited , we fixed the line energy to 6.7kev .",
    "the width of the ring is hard to estimate , but all fits suggest that it is very small .",
    "we fixed it to be 0.2 of the outer radius .",
    "choosing other value does not seriously affect the results presented below as long as it is not too wide .",
    "we assume the ionized line set just inside the transition zone , so the outer radius of this ring is set to the inner edge of the above disk .",
    "this line model has 4 free parameters , the inner disk radius , the inclination and two normalizations , which is only one more free parameter than the free width gaussian fit .",
    "the data can be very well fitted by this model ( fig .",
    "3 ) . however , the data quality is not sufficient to determine all parameters .",
    "we therefore fit the spectrum for different inclinations of disk .",
    "the best fit truncated radius is @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36gm / c@xmath37 for @xmath38=20 , 30and 50 , respectively .",
    "all fits are better than a gaussian line model with a @xmath39=0.5 , 2.2 , 3.7 for @xmath38=20 , 30 , and 50 , respectively , for the same number of free parameters .",
    "this again gives an estimate of the truncated radius to be @xmath40 , which is consistent with the requirement of an outer thin disk truncated at about @xmath41 from the shape of ouv continuum in last section .",
    "these results give strong evidence for the existence of an truncated outer thin disk and an inner hot flows in the nucleus of ngc4593 , though it is hard to determine the exact truncation radius .",
    "in this letter , our main result is that there may exist a truncated thin disk in ngc4593 .",
    "both the ouv continuum spectral shape and iron k@xmath0 line profile , two independent observations in different bands , consistently require an outer thin disk truncated at about 30@xmath15 , instead of extending down to the last stable orbit .",
    "this result is very interesting because ngc4593 is a normal seyfert 1 galaxy and much more luminous than previously known objects suspected to have a truncated thin disk .",
    "ngc4258 is a well known object suspected to accrete material via two component disk ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "chary et al .",
    "( 2000 ) argued that its infrared spectrum ( @xmath42 ) obviates the need for a substantial contribution from an outer thin disk , and can be interpreted by a pure adaf .",
    "the lack of nuclear emission data in ouv bands , which should give a strong constraint on the existence of a truncated thin disk , makes it hard to ascertain whether the accretion flow consists of two component or only a pure adaf .",
    "ngc4593 has a similar sed shape with that of ngc4258 and , furthermore , the nuclear emission data in ouv bands are available .",
    "its ouv spectra can well be modeled by a truncated thin disk .",
    "if the inferred black hole mass and the interpretation of the ouv continuum are both correct , then @xmath19 is suggested to be about 0.055 .",
    "theoretically , the accretion flow of a system with such an accretion rate probably has the configuration of an outer thin disk and an inner adaf , which has been studied in detail by esin , mcclintock & narayan ( 1997 ) for lmxb .",
    "if the true mass of the central black hole is larger than the inferred one by an order of magnitude , then it may also be possible to interpret the sed of ngc4593 by a pure adaf .",
    "however , the turn over at ouv band can not be explained by such a pure adaf . it is emphasized here that ngc4593 might be a good candidate for the implication of the two component accretion flows .",
    "the change in the x - ray spectrum from a low state to a high state may correspond with the variation of the truncated radius which is principally caused by the variation of the accretion rate .",
    "the dynamics of how a transition from an outer thin disk to an inner adaf in the accretion flow is still poorly understood , the only known physical process of `` evaporation '' possibly takes the responsibility for this change ( @xcite ) .",
    "further model fitting of the multi - band spectra for ngc4593 will be presented in future work , and it is of theoretical interest to constrain the dynamics of the transition by this fitting .",
    "the iron k@xmath0 line in ngc4593 is not like the relativistic broadening one seen in mcg-6 - 30 - 15 ( @xcite , @xcite ) , but is moderately broad and requires the thin disk to be truncated at a radius @xmath43 .",
    "similar results were reported in recent analyses of the asca spectrum of ngc5548 ( @xcite ) and of the asca and rxte spectra of ic4329a ( @xcite ) , where the lines are broad , but not as broad as expected from a disk extending down to the last stable orbit . moreover ,",
    "the fact that amount of relativistically smeared reflection is rather less than unity for ic4329a ( @xcite ) , is inconsistent with a cold disk extending down to the last stable orbit , and also supports the existence of a truncated thin disk in the system .",
    "these results are consistent with the classification of these objects as having the configuration of an outer thin disk and an inner adaf ( @xcite ) .",
    "this highlights the possibility that the two component accretion flow may be common in seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "however , using the bepposax data , guainazzi et al . ( 1999 ) reported that the amount of reflection and iron line properties are consistent with an illuminated cold disk down to @xmath44 .",
    "this is inconsistent with our result .",
    "the incosistency is partly caused by the lower spectral resolution of bepposax ( than asca ) , which causes the line profile to be less constrained .",
    "moreover , the line profile is also broadened by inclusion of a sharp edge in their model , which is not a correct assumption since it would be smoothed by relativistic effects .",
    "it should be emphasized here that a two component model , a 6.7kev line from the transition region and a 6.4kev fluorescence line from an outer thin disk , can well fit the iron line in ngc4593 in this letter .",
    "asca observations detected an iron line with a centroid energy @xmath45kev in llagns ( see @xcite for m81 and @xcite for ngc4579 ) , which is incompatible with the 6.4kev fluorescent line expected from a thin disk as in the typical case of mcg-6 - 30 - 15 .",
    "for these systems ( say m81 and ngc4579 ) , the inner edge of a thin disk ( at the transition radius ) lies at around 100@xmath15 ( @xcite ) , thus there is no significant fluorescent line emission from the outer thin disk .",
    "if the inner edge goes in ( possibly with an increasing accretion rate ) , some fluorescent line emission from the outer thin disk will contribute as is the case in ngc4593 .",
    "it may be also true for ngc5548 and ic4329a .",
    "future x - ray spectroscopy observations with _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ should give a further test of the two component accretion flow .",
    "we summarize our main result as the existence of a truncated thin disk in the nucleus of ngc4593 .",
    "ngc4593 may be a typical candidate which accretes material via an outer thin disk and an inner adaf with accretion rate @xmath46 .",
    "detail investigation on those objects which are suspected to accrete material via an outer thin disk and an inner adaf , is crucial in establishing two component accretion flows on firm footing .",
