    "binary neutron star mergers belong to the strongest gravitational wave sources for interferometer - type gravitational wave observatories as ligo @xcite , virgo @xcite , geo600 @xcite and tama @xcite . after a long inspiral process which lasts millions of years",
    ", the final merger phase takes place on a millisecond timescale .",
    "the onset of merger is given when the two companions become dynamically unstable near the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) and mass transfer starts . since the process has no definite symmetries , 3d hydrodynamic simulations are necessary .",
    "in addition , because of the compactness of the system , general relativistic effects have to be considered and treated as accurately as possible .    it has been pointed out that the gravitational wave frequency @xmath2 relates to the compactness @xmath3 of a neutron star as @xmath4 near the isco , meaning that the gravitational wave frequency just before merger carries information on the radius of the neutron star .",
    "hence the gw signal may constrain the equation of state ( eos ) of high density matter , ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it has also been found recently that a neutron star formed after the merger may be supported by rapid and differential rotation even if its mass exceeds 60% of the maximum mass of a single non - rotating neutron star , and the gw are emitted due to non - axisymmetric and quasiradial oscillations of the remnant for longer than the dynamical timescale @xcite . if these oscillations persist for a longer time , the integrated gravitational wave may be detectable , carrying information on the high density matter .",
    "in addition to general relativistic gravity , various physics should be taken into account for many aspects of the binary neutron star merger problem such are the nuclear forces summarized in the eos , neutrino physics and magnetic fields .",
    "so far , however , due to this complexity , investigations have concentrated either on the relativistic aspects of the problem using a simple eos , or on the microphysical aspects while treating gravity in a newtonian framework .",
    "the pioneering work was done by oohara & nakamura in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "relativistic aspects have been considered using the post - newtonian approximation ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , the conformally flat approximation ( @xcite ; @xcite ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) ) and a fully general relativistic treatment ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "microphysical improvements have been applied by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) using different eoss @xcite and a leakage scheme to account for neutrino emission after the merger . for a review on the topic , see @xcite .    in this paper , we focus on two eos for high density neutron star matter , one describing pure nuclear matter , the other nuclear matter with a transition to a quark phase at very high densities . a reason for investigating these",
    "eoss is that the quark phase transition may be one of the most dramatic phenomena to change the compactness of neutron stars , and therefore its influence may be clearly observed in the gw spectrum of an inspiralling binary system . following our previous work @xcite , we consider the merger problem in the conformally flat approximation .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sect : eqns ] , we summarize the formalism to solve the einstein and the relativistic hydrodynamic equations . and describe the numerical implementation , the choice of eos and the initial conditions . in sect .",
    "[ sect : results ] , we present the results of the paper and finally , we draw conclusions in sect . [",
    "sect : conclusions ] .",
    "in this section we describe the numerical methods and the physics on which our simulations are based .",
    "we consider a general relativistic fluid whose internal properties are described by a given eos .",
    "two sets of equations have to be solved simultaneously . on one hand side ,",
    "we consider the relativistic hydrodynamic equations governing the fluid motion on the other side the einstein equation of general relativity determining the spacetime metric and therefore the gravitational interaction . on top of it , an eos which closes the system of hydrodynamic equations , has to given as an input .      in the 3 + 1 decomposition of spacetime ,",
    "the metric @xmath5can be written as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the lapse function , @xmath8 is the shift vector , and @xmath9 is the spatial metric .",
    "spacetime quantities are decomposed with respect to the foliation using the hypersurface normal defined as @xmath10 with @xmath11 and a projection tensor defined as @xmath12 , whose spatial component agrees with the spatial metric .",
    "the einstein field equations can be written as a set of two evolution equations @xmath13\\nonumber\\\\ & & -\\nabla_i\\nabla_j\\alpha+\\beta^l\\nabla_lk_{ij}+k_{il}\\nabla_j\\beta^l+k_{jl}\\nabla_i\\beta^l,\\label{eqn : kijevol}\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and two constraint equations @xmath14 for the dynamic variables @xmath9 and @xmath15 , the extrinsic curvature of the hypersurface ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . here , @xmath16 is the ricci tensor and @xmath17 the covariant derivative associated with @xmath9 .",
    "the stress energy tensor @xmath18 is decomposed into @xmath19 , the matter energy density , @xmath20 , the matter momentum density and @xmath21 , the spatial projection of the stress energy tensor .",
    "finally , @xmath22 and @xmath23 denote the traces of @xmath16 , @xmath24 and @xmath15 , respectively .    in the following discussion",
    ", we consider a perfect fluid with a matter stress energy tensor @xmath25 here , @xmath26 refers to the rest mass density , @xmath27 to the specific relativistic enthalpy , @xmath28 to the specific internal energy , @xmath29 to the four velocity and @xmath30 to the fluid pressure .",
    "then , @xmath31 the lorentz factor @xmath32 can be calculated using the normalisation condition @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath34    isenberg proposed a waveless approximation to general relativity , in which he truncates some terms in einstein s equation written in the adm formalism to deduce an elliptic type formalism @xcite .",
    "later , the same set of equations have been rediscovered by wilson and mathews @xcite and widely used to solve single or binary neutron stars problems .",
    "( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as binary black hole systems @xcite .",
    "the isenberg - wilson - mathews theory has its own hamiltonian as pointed out by isenberg himself ( also discussed in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this approximation ,",
    "the conformally flat condition for the spatial geometry @xmath35 and @xmath36 are imposed , where @xmath37 is the flat 3-metric .",
    "it may be viewed that the second one is a choice of a temporal gauge condition , the maximal slicing condition , while the first one is an approximation as well as partly a spatial gauge choice ( details can be found in * ? ? ?",
    "the remaining metric variables @xmath38 do not satisfy all components of the einstein s field equation consistently .",
    "we pick the constraints and the trace of the evolution equation for @xmath15 as equations for the above five variables , which leads to the same set of equations derived from isenberg s hamiltonian mentioned above .",
    "the approximation leads to a considerable simplification of the einstein equations , since all metric equations can be written in elliptic form .",
    "the trace of the evolution equation for @xmath15 together with the maximal slicing condition @xmath39 leads to an equation for the lapse @xmath40    the trace - free part of the evolution equation for @xmath9 together with the conformally flat condition @xmath35 provides @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a derivative with respect to the coordinate associated with @xmath37 and @xmath43 relate to the shift @xmath8 through the flat metric as @xmath44 .",
    "the hamiltonian constraint provides an equation for the conformal factor @xmath45 finally , with the momentum constraint we obtain an equation for the shift vector @xmath46 where @xmath47 . using the definition @xmath48 ( [ eqn : momentumc ] ) splits into two simpler parts @xmath49 and @xmath50 while the trace - free components of the evolution - equation for @xmath9 ( [ eqn : gammaevol ] ) are used to relate @xmath15 and the metric variables as in equation ( [ kijform ] ) , its trace part and the trace - free components of the evolution - equation for @xmath15 ( [ eqn : kijevol ] ) are dropped by the cf approximation .",
    "the trace of ( [ eqn : gammaevol ] ) can be used to check the accuracy and reliability of the cf approximation @xcite    the relativistic hydrodynamic equations can be written in the following way @xmath51,\\\\ { \\partial_t ( \\rho^ * h u_k ) } + { \\partial_i ( \\rho^ * h u_k v^i ) }      & = & -{\\alpha \\gamma^{1/2}}{\\partial_k p}+\\\\      \\rho^ * h \\biggl[-\\alpha u^0 { \\partial_k \\alpha }      & + & u_j { \\partial_k \\beta^j }      -\\frac{u_i u_j } { 2 u^0 }       { \\partial_k \\gamma^{ij } } \\biggr],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 in the case of conformal flatness , the system reduces to @xmath53 with @xmath54 here , we have cast the system into a lagrangian formulation which is better suited for an implementation on a computer using a lagrangian scheme like sph ( cf .",
    "[ sect : implementation ] ) .",
    "the conserved hydrodynamic variables are @xmath55 whereas the primitive variables are @xmath56 .      to solve the system of hydrodynamic equations ( [ conteqn ] ) - ( [ energyeqn ] ) we use the smoothed particle hydrodynamics method ( sph ; @xcite ) , which is widely used in astronomical and astrophysical simulations . the original form of sph that solves the newtonian hydrodynamic equations is presented in @xcite",
    "we list here the generalized version which is appropriate for the above relativistic hydrodynamic equations . for details , see @xcite .",
    "the continuity equation turns into a relation between @xmath57 and the rest masses of the individual particles @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the rest mass of particle @xmath60 and @xmath61 denotes the weight given by the standard spherical spline kernel function @xmath62 .",
    "the rest masses @xmath63 and the smoothing length @xmath64 are initially chosen to fit an initial spatial distribution of @xmath57 . the pressure gradient contained in the momentum equation ( [ momentumeqn ] ) is calculated as in standard sph but replacing @xmath26 by @xmath65 , @xmath66 the energy equation ( [ energyeqn ] ) contains a pdv - term similar to newtonian sph @xmath67 the additional terms in the momentum and energy equation that arise from the gravitational interaction are evaluated by first solving the equations for the metric variables @xmath7,@xmath68 and @xmath8 on a overlaid grid ( see discussion below ) and by mapping back those quantities onto the particles by second - order interpolation . the total time derivative of @xmath69 in the energy equation is evaluated using second order finite differencing in time .    on top of these equations , an artificial viscosity ( av ) scheme is implemented with time - dependent viscosity parameters @xcite which have only significant values in the presence of shocks .",
    "the av produces an additional viscous pressure which is added to the physical fluid pressure @xcite .",
    "the field equations ( [ eqn : alphapsi],[eqn : psi],[eqn : b ] and [ eqn : chi ] ) are discretized on a grid which covers the matter distribution .",
    "the evaluation proceeds generally in three steps    * first , we calculate the source corresponding to the potential .",
    "the involved hydrodynamic quantities defined on the sph particles are transferred onto the grid by assigning sph - interpolated values to the grid points , i.e. @xmath70 * afterwards , the potential is obtained by solving the corresponding poisson - equation . the @xmath68- and the @xmath71-equation are closely linked together and are therefore solved in two iteration steps using the solution from the previous timestep as a guess .",
    "the remaining four equations determining the shift vector are also closely coupled and are solved simultaneously within the fmg algorithm . *",
    "all needed derivatives are calculated on the grid using finite differencing . *",
    "finally , the potential and its derivatives are mapped back onto the sph particle distribution using a triangular shaped cloud ( tsc ) method @xcite known from particle mesh codes .",
    "this is equivalent to a second order interpolation .",
    "boundary conditions and extensions of the solution beyond the grid are obtained using a multipole expansion of the source term . for details",
    "we refer to @xcite .    like the newtonian and the first - order post - newtonian ( 1pn ) approximation ,",
    "the cf approximation does not include gravitational radiation and its reaction by construction .",
    "we therefore have to add an additional gravitational wave ( gw ) extraction scheme and a radiation reaction force which accounts for the angular momentum and energy carried away by gw . the waveform in transverse - traceless gauge is extracted in the slow - motion limit @xcite and up to quadrupole order using @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the mass - quadrupole of the system .",
    "the radiation - reaction force is chosen in a similar way to the original burke - thorne expression @xmath74 with @xmath75 , but its strength @xmath76 is chosen such that the resulting angular momentum loss by backreaction @xmath77 reproduces the expression @xmath78 of the slow motion gw extraction approximation up to a difference of the order of @xmath79 .",
    "since @xmath80 , we can obtain the angular momentum change using @xmath81 the expressions @xmath82 , the numerical angular momentum error , and @xmath83 , the total angular momentum change per unit time , are obtained by evaluating ( [ eqn : dotj ] ) before adding and after adding the backreaction force terms , respectively . since @xmath82 has an oscillating behaviour around zero , as a result thereof , @xmath83 depends on the binary orbit .",
    "therefore , in practical determination of the value of @xmath76 , we take an average @xmath84 for about a half orbit , and compare with @xmath85 computed from the quadrupole formula ( [ eqn : quad ] ) that is averaged for the same orbit . for model b1",
    "we obtain for the ratio @xmath86 at the isco , where the average is made over one orbital period , while at a certain period of time @xmath82 may become comparable to @xmath83 .",
    "since the ratio @xmath87 is negligible , the radiation reaction force is clearly driving the inspiral process , although the predicted time to merger have to be taken with care due to the approximative radiation reaction scheme and the spatially conformal flat assumption used in our initial conditions and simulations .",
    "fully relativistic inspiral simulations @xcite are intrinsically consistent concerning radiation reaction dissipation but they still depend on the outer boundary location .      to investigate the influence of quark matter to a neutron star merger , we consider two equations of state , an eos describing pure nuclear matter ( `` hadronic eos '' ) and an eos describing nuclear matter with a phase transition to quark matter at very high densities ( `` hybrid eos '' ) .    the hadronic eos is realized using the non - linear @xmath76-@xmath88-model in the relativistic mean field approximation with the tm1 parameter set which is motivated by a least - square fit to experimental results including stable and unstable nuclei @xcite . at densities above @xmath89 this is a good approximation . for lower values , when inhomogeneous nuclear matter appears and the non - linear @xmath76-@xmath88 model is not valid any more , other approximations have to be used ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in our case",
    ", we append a polytropic eos @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are adjusted to fulfill smoothness of pressure and internal energy .",
    "we choose the transition density to the polytropic eos at @xmath93 which leads to @xmath94 , similar to common realistic eoss in this density regime .",
    "the hybrid eos is obtained by combining the hadronic eos with a mit bag model @xcite using a variable pressure phase transition construction @xcite .",
    "we use massless up and down quarks and a bag constant of @xmath95 .",
    "the resulting hybrid eos then describes three physical phases    * a pure hadronic phase below @xmath96 where the eos coincides with the hadronic eos . here",
    ", @xmath97 is the nuclear saturation density .",
    "the stiffness in this region varies between @xmath98 and @xmath99 . * a quark - hadron mixed phase between @xmath100 and @xmath101 @xmath102 where both quark and hadrons are present . in this phase transition region",

    "the redundant internal energy information from the eos is dropped and we consider the pressure as a function of the density alone .",
    "this is a good approximation in the high - density regime where thermal effects to the pressure are rather small . at lower densities ( e.g. in the disk around the merger remnant )",
    "the thermal component is certainly not negligible .",
    "however we concentrate in this work on the high - density merger remnant so we claim to be rather accurate with this approximation although thermal effects could have an effect via neutrino losses .      to construct initial conditions",
    ", we assume the binary to be in a quasi - equilibrium state .",
    "this assumption is not very well satisfied in the very vicinity of the isco @xcite and we therefore choose slightly wider initial orbits . in our models",
    "the binaries have initially no radial velocity either and need about half an orbit to begin with the inspiral .",
    "we apply the method of ury & eriguchi ( 2000 ) to construct an initial configuration .",
    "this method takes an eos as an input and then solves the hydrostatic equation for an irrotational velocity field together with the einstein field equations in the cf approximation . a similar method",
    "has been developed by @xcite .",
    "we map the output of the above method , the hydrodynamic quantities and the conformal factor onto a distribution of sph particles .",
    "finally , this sph distribution is relaxed to avoid spurious inter - particle forces using a braking term @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the given initial irrotational velocity field of the initial mass distribution . using this method",
    ", we produce a set of irrotational quasi - equilibrium configurations , both varying the eos and the gravitational mass @xmath106 , where @xmath106 refers to the mass of a single ns in isolation . for @xmath106",
    ", we use values between @xmath107 which is at the lower limit of the observational range and @xmath108 which is close to the maximal gravitational ns mass of @xmath109 of the hybrid eos .",
    "the models are summarized in tab .",
    "[ tab : initconf ] .",
    "the letter part ( a - e ) in the model label indicates the mass while the number part ( 1,2 ) indicates the eos .",
    "all orbits are taken slightly outside the isco , about @xmath110 in coordinate separation .",
    "this results in smaller lag angles and its oscillations in the initial phase since tidal forces are weaker at larger separation . in tab . [",

    "@xmath106 denotes the gravitational mass of one ns in isolation and @xmath111 is the compactness .",
    "both the masses and the compactness refer to one binary component in isolation .",
    "@xmath112 denotes the number of sph particles and @xmath113 is the number of grid points . in model e1 ,",

    "the diamonds correspond to the hadronic eos - models a1 to d1 , the values for @xmath117 and @xmath118 are taken from @xcite , width=321 ]",
    "in this work , we have considered the impact of the eos to the inspiral and merger dynamics of a binary neutron star coalescence .",
    "we have performed equilibrium sequence studies to investigate the gw frequencies around the isco .",
    "then , dynamical simulations of the merging event using a 3-dimensional sph code have been carried out .",
    "we have chosen a hadronic eos based on the relativistic mean field approximation and a hybrid eos which is obtained by combining the hadronic eos with a mit - bag - model - eos in the high - density regime above @xmath119 .",
    "the gravitational wave frequency at the isco depends strongly on the initial mass of the binary . for a generic mass of @xmath120",
    ", we find a gw frequency of around 900hz for both eoss .",
    "eos differences become important for models with initial gravitational masses larger than @xmath121 . at this mass range ,",
    "the central density of the individual stars reach the phase transition @xmath122 included in the hybrid eos model . at masses close to the maximum gravitational mass of the hybrid eos , @xmath123 ,",
    "the relative difference in @xmath2 becomes as large as @xmath124 .",
    "+ the maximum density evolution during the merger depends sensitively on the fact whether the phase transition density is crossed and at which time . for very massive models like models",
    "e1/e2 with an initial mass of @xmath108 this is already fulfilled by the individual companion stars in the pre - merger phase .",
    "less massive models with masses below @xmath125 cross this threshold later in the post - merger phase when the matter is contracting to form a transient ns or a bh .",
    "the hadronic eos models all form a transient ns except the very massive e1 model which collapses immediately . in the d1 model , the maximum density does not converge after 12ms but rises slowly and continuously .",
    "we think that this is an effect of a considerable angular momentum transport from the remnant core to the outer layers which implies a continuous conversion of the differential rotation pattern into uniform rotation .",
    "all hybrid eos models collapse on timescales which is highly dependent on the model mass . while the massive models e2 and d2 collapse immediately , models c2 and b2 collapse after a contraction of the remnant on several dynamical timescales and a considerable decrease of the degree of differential rotation .",
    "this indicates that the collapse is driven in this case by angular momentum transport caused e.g. by numerical viscosity .",
    "the collapse dynamics of these models will be investigated in future work .",
    "the emitted gravitational waveforms are very dependent on the initial mass of the model .",
    "the most massive model e1/e2 shows a large difference prior to merger both in frequency and amplitude .",
    "this is a consequence of the different compactnesses for the models e1 and e2 due to the different eoss .",
    "the same effect is not visible in the less massive models because the compactness difference due to the eoss vanishes .",
    "a second aspect of the gw signal is the waveform emitted by the remnant .",
    "if the remnant does not collapse immediately to a bh , a quasi - periodic waveform with a frequency of 2 - 3khz is emitted .",
    "the ratio of this frequency to the gw frequency at the isco @xmath126 depends sensitively on the model and therefore on the mass or compactness @xmath3 .",
    "since @xmath126 is fairly constant for an eos with constant stiffness , we interpret this result as a consequence of the varying stiffness of our eos used .",
    "hence , the relation @xmath126-@xmath3 is characteristic for the behaviour of the eos s stiffness",
    ". a measurement of this quantity would provide important additional information of the eos .",
    "it has been suggested in @xcite that measurements of high frequency gw will require a network of broadband detectors combined with narrowband detectors that have a good sensitivity in the high frequency domain .",
    "such measurements of high frequency gw may become feasible in the future and discover or constrain the existence of phase transition in neutron star matter at high densities .",

    "<S> we consider the influence of potential quark matter existing at high densities in neutron star interiors on gravitational waves ( gw ) emitted in a binary neutron star merger event . </S>",
    "<S> two types of equations of state ( eos ) at zero temperatures are used , one describing pure nuclear matter , the other nuclear matter with a phase transition to quark matter at very high densities . </S>",
    "<S> binary equilibrium sequences close to the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) are calculated to determine the gw frequencies just before merger . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that eos effects begin to play a role for gravitational masses larger than @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the difference in the gravitational wave frequency at the isco grows to up to @xmath1 for the maximal allowed mass given by the eoss used . </S>",
    "<S> then , we perform 3d hydrodynamic simulations for each eos varying the initial mass and determine the characteristic gw frequencies of the merger remnants . the implications of quark matter show up mainly in a different collapse behaviour of the merger remnant . if the collapse does not take place immediately after merger , we find a phase difference between two eos s in the post - merger gw signal . </S>",
    "<S> we also compare the gw frequencies emitted by the merger remnant to values from simulations using a polytropic eos and find an imprint of the non - constant adiabatic index of our eoss . </S>",
    "<S> all calculations are based on the conformally flat ( cf ) approximation to general relativity and the gw signal from the merger simulation is extracted up to quadrupole order .    </S>",
