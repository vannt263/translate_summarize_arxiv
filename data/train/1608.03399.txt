    "dynamical phenomena associated with the ordering process of spin systems have been studied since a long time .",
    "while the domain growth and behaviour of correlation functions were the original issues of interest @xcite , other phenomena like persistence and its variants have been extensively studied more recently @xcite .",
    "it is indeed astonishing to note that even after decades of research on these topics , newer features have been revealed .",
    "for example , in the zero temperature quenching dynamics of ising model , frozen states @xcite and blinkers @xcite as nonequilibrium steady states have been shown to occur in dimensions greater than one .",
    "recent studies of the zero temperature quenching dynamics in the two dimensional ising model indicated that the domain growth behaviour can be explained in the framework of percolation theory @xcite .",
    "different ways of employing the zero temperature quench have also been explored in some very recent works in the ising model @xcite .",
    "models with more complicated interactions with binary spin variables have often indicated the existence of dynamical universality classes other than the simple ising model even in one dimension @xcite .",
    "prior to the discovery of the persistence phenomena @xcite in the ising and other spin models , it was believed that there is only one dynamical exponent which governs the behaviour of the system during the ordering dynamics .",
    "the persistence probability showed a power law decay with an exponent which could not be related to other known static or dynamic exponents .",
    "this indicated that there is a second independent dynamic exponent .",
    "since the domain size and persistence show power law behaviour , there is essentially no timescale associated with these quantities .",
    "physically this means that there are finite probabilities existing even at very large timescales . on the other hand ,",
    "diverging timescales can be associated with dynamical behaviour close to the critical point .",
    "the typical relaxation behaviour of the order parameter @xmath17 as a function of time @xmath3 is exponential close to the critical temperature : @xmath18 , with @xmath5 diverging as the critical temperature is approached .    in the present work ,",
    "we consider the zero temperature single spin flip glauber dynamics of ising model with nearest neighbour interaction when the initial configuration is non - homogeneous , i.e. the fraction of up and down spins are different .",
    "@xmath19 is the fraction of up spins ranging between @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath22 is the homogeneous case and due to up / down spin symmetry , it is sufficient to take @xmath23 .",
    "the spins are otherwise uncorrelated .",
    "three types of persistence behaviour is studied : @xmath24 ( persistence for up spins ) , @xmath25 ( persistence for down spins ) and @xmath26 ( persistence for the total system ) . the exact expression for the variation of the above",
    "mentioned quantities are known in one dimension in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we have numerically evaluated the persistence probabilities for finite systems and checked that the familiar finite size scaling @xcite is valid for all values of @xmath19 .",
    "our main results are for the two dimensional model , here we have numerically obtained the behaviour of @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 and find the presence of a diverging timescale associated with @xmath24 or @xmath25 , whichever corresponds to the initial minority .",
    "another quantity associated with the ordering process that has been studied quite intensely in recent years is the exit probability . as a function of @xmath19 ( the initial fraction of up spins ) ,",
    "the exit probability @xmath27 is defined as the probability that the final state comprises all up spins .",
    "the behaviour of the exit probability helps in understanding qualitatively the persistence probability in the ising model .",
    "hence we have also conducted a detailed study of the exit probability in two dimensions to gain more insight into the problem .    in the next two sections ,",
    "the results for one and two dimensionsal ising model are discussed respectively . in the last section , summary and",
    "some discussions are presented .",
    "for systems with non - uniform initial condition i.e. with unequal initial fraction of up and down spins , the exact result for the ising model in one dimension shows that the density of persistent spins decays algebraically as @xcite    @xmath28    the exponents are different for the up and down spins ;    @xmath29 ^ 2-\\frac{1}{8}\\ ] ]    where @xmath30 @xmath31 is the initial concentration of up ( down ) spins . for equal initial fraction of up and down",
    "spins ( i.e. for @xmath32 ) we have @xmath33 @xcite . in this paper",
    "we follow the notation @xmath34 unless otherwise specified .    during the coarsening",
    ", the typical domain size @xmath35 shows a power - law growth with time : @xmath36 @xmath37 being the domain growth exponent . for the ising model @xmath38 in all dimensions @xcite .",
    "while the persistence exponents are @xmath19 dependent , the domain growth exponent @xmath37 is identical for all @xmath19 .",
    "this is easy to explain .",
    "consider , e.g. the growth phenomena for @xmath39 . immediately after the time evolution starts",
    ", @xmath19 will attain a different value .",
    "one might as well consider this to be the initial state , hence @xmath38 for all @xmath19 @xcite .    in one dimension",
    ", it is known that for the homogeneous case , the persistence probability obeys finite size scaling .",
    "the behaviour of the persistent probability @xmath40 in a system with linear dimension @xmath41 can be summarised as @xcite @xmath42 with @xmath43 .",
    "we check whether this is also valid when @xmath44 .",
    "obviously , if valid , the associated exponent @xmath45 should vary with @xmath19 , since @xmath37 is constant .",
    "finite size scaling analysis in one dimension was performed for all the three variants of the persistence probability for @xmath1 .",
    "simulations were made for system sizes @xmath46 taking average over at least 1000 configurations . in each monte carlo step ,",
    "@xmath41 spins are chosen randomly and updated .",
    "asynchronous updating rule is used and periodic boundary condition imposed .",
    "we find that indeed the finite size scaling ( [ fsseq ] ) is valid , as the curves for different values of @xmath41 collapsed with proper choice of @xmath45 , keeping @xmath47 ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "it is checked that these values of @xmath45 are consistent with the relation @xmath48 . in table",
    "[ table ] we have summarised the values of @xmath49 and @xmath45 obtained for two different values of @xmath19 .",
    "the values of @xmath50 and @xmath51 differ from the exact values by less than 0.05% . as for the up ,",
    "down and total spins @xmath49 is different , the corresponding values @xmath52",
    ", @xmath53 and @xmath54 also turn out to be different .",

    "this indicates that there is a finite probability of ending up with either all up or all down spins even for values of @xmath44 ( except for @xmath65 and @xmath21 ) .",
    "in the ordering dynamics of the two dimensional ising model , the three variants of persistence were studied for various values of @xmath19 less than @xmath66 on @xmath67 square lattices with @xmath68 .",

    "no appreciable finite size dependence is found for these two persitence probablilities ( inset of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) . by the present convention",
    ", @xmath25 is the persistence probability for the down spins , which is the initial majority . generalising the notation for initial majority and minority spins",
    ", we have @xmath70 saturating to a finite value and @xmath71 going to zero . to explain why @xmath70 does not show system size dependence",
    ", we can argue like this : had it been decreasing with size , it would ultimately go to zero . on the other hand ,",
    "had it been increasing for larger sizes , it would approach 1 .",
    "both the possibilities are unrealistic and hence no system size dependence is observed .",
    "since @xmath26 is basically a weighted average of @xmath24 and @xmath25 , its nature is dominated by that of @xmath25 , the majority spins , and hence it does not show finite size dependence also .",
    "the persistence probabilities do not show algebraic behaviour unlike in the one dimensional ising model .",
    "the persistence probability for majority spins as well as for the total spins do not show much interesting behaviour as they decay to rather high saturation values and show no finite size dependence .",
    "however in case of the minority spins , finite size effect is apparent and a number of interesting features are revealed on further analysis .",
    "the decay of the persistence probability @xmath71 can be fitted to the form @xmath72 which is a combination of an algebraic decay accompanied by an stretched exponential cutoff ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "we find that this fit is valid almost up to the time where @xmath71 saturates to a finite value .",
    "the fits become more accurate as @xmath19 approaches 0.5 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath71 extrapolates to a zero value for @xmath73 .",
    "however , the @xmath71 versus @xmath3 curves for different values of @xmath41 ( shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) shows that the finite size dependence is evident only at times beyond which @xmath71 saturates .",

    "no exact result is known for the persistence exponent even for @xmath22 and one depends only on approximate estimates , most of which are numerical @xcite .",

    "if this can be shown directly it will lead to a very important and striking result that domain growth and persistence probability are no longer independent for @xmath39 .",
