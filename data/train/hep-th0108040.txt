    "during the past decade , exact renormalization group equations @xcite , in particular in the context of the effective average action @xcite , have become a powerful tool for the investigation of nonperturbative phenomena in both quantum field theory and in statistical physics .",
    "those renormalization group ( rg ) , or flow equations may be regarded the counterpart for the continuum of wilson s renormalization group of iterated kadanoff block spin transformations which had been formulated for discrete spin systems originally @xcite . in both cases",
    "the central idea is to `` integrate out '' all fluctuations with momenta larger than some cutoff @xmath0 , and to take account of them by means of a modified dynamics for the remaining fluctuation modes with momenta smaller than @xmath0 .",
    "this modified dynamics is governed by a scale dependent effective hamiltonian or effective action , @xmath1 , whose @xmath0-dependence is described by a functional differential equation , the exact rg equation .    in quantum field theory",
    "this general strategy can be applied to both `` effective '' and `` fundamental '' theories . by definition ,",
    "an effective theory is valid only if all relevant momenta of the process under consideration are close to some specific scale @xmath0 which characterizes the theory . if @xmath1 is the action of an effective theory at scale @xmath0 we can compute cross sections for the scattering of particles with momenta ( or relevant momentum transfers ) of the order of @xmath0 , with all quantum effects included , by simply evaluating the _ tree _ diagrams of @xmath1 .",
    "exact rg equations can be used in order to evolve @xmath1 to a smaller scale @xmath2 by further `` coarse graining '' .",
    "flow equations may also be used for a complete quantization of fundamental theories . if the latter has the classical action @xmath3 one imposes the initial condition @xmath4 at the ultraviolet ( uv ) cutoff scale @xmath5 , uses the exact rg equation to compute @xmath1 for all @xmath6 , and then sends @xmath7 and @xmath8 . loosely speaking",
    ", the defining property of a fundamental theory is that the `` continuum limit '' @xmath8 actually exists after the `` renormalization '' - in the traditional sense of the word - of finitely many parameters in the action ; only a finite number of generalized couplings in @xmath9 is undetermined and has to be taken from the experiment .",
    "this is the case for perturbatively renormalizable theories @xcite , but there are also perturbatively nonrenormalizable theories which admit a limit @xmath10 .",
    "the `` continuum '' limit of those nonperturbatively renormalizable theories is taken at a non - gaussian fixed point of the rg flow .",
    "it replaces the gaussian fixed point which , at least implicitly , underlies the construction of perturbatively renormalizable theories @xcite . thus knowing its fixed point structure is crucial if one wants to assess whether a given model qualifies as a _ fundamental _ theory .",
    "in this paper we shall use a formulation where @xmath1 is the `` effective average action '' @xcite .",
    "it is a coarse grained free energy functional which is constructed in close analogy with the standard effective action @xmath11 to which it reduces in the limit of a vanishing infrared ( ir ) cutoff , @xmath7 .",
    "the euclidean functional integral for the generating functional @xmath12 is modified by adding an ir cutoff term @xmath13 to the classical action .",
    "it supplies a momentum dependent @xmath14-term @xmath15 for a mode of the quantum field with momentum @xmath16 .",
    "the cutoff function @xmath15 vanishes for @xmath17 ; hence the high - momentum modes get integrated out in the usual way .",
    "for @xmath18 it behaves as @xmath19 so that the small - momentum modes get suppressed in the path integral by a mass term @xmath20 @xcite . the scale dependent action @xmath1 is closely related to the legendre transform of the modified generating functional @xmath21 . when regarded as a function of @xmath0",
    ", @xmath1 runs along a rg trajectory in the space of all actions which starts at @xmath4 and ends at @xmath22 . in the simplest case , the exact rg equation which describes this trajectory has the following structure : @xmath23\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath24 denotes the infinite dimensional matrix of second functional derivatives of @xmath1 with respect to all dynamical fields .",
    "this construction is fairly straightforward for matter fields , the inclusion of gauge fields introduces additional complications though . using background gauge techniques , a solution to this problem was given in refs .",
    "@xcite for yang - mills theory and in refs .",
    "@xcite for gravity . leaving the faddeev - popov ghosts aside ,",
    "the effective average action for gravity , @xmath25 $ ] , depends not only on the `` ordinary '' dynamical metric @xmath26 but also on a background metric @xmath27 .",
    "the conventional effective action @xmath28 $ ] is obtained as the @xmath7 limit of the functional @xmath29\\equiv\\gamma_k[g,\\bar{g}=g]$ ] with the two metrics identified @xcite .",
    "the motivation for this construction is that in this manner @xmath29 $ ] becomes invariant under general coordinate transformations .",
    "nonperturbative solutions to the above rg equation which do not require a small expansion parameter can be obtained by the method of `` truncations '' .",
    "this means that one projects the rg flow from the infinite dimensional space of all actions onto some finite dimensional subspace which is particularly relevant for the problem at hand . in this manner",
    "the functional rg equation becomes an ordinary differential equation for a finite set of generalized couplings which serve as coordinates on this subspace . in ref .",
    "@xcite the rg flow of quantum general relativity was projected on the 2-dimensional subspace spanned by the invariants @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "this so - called einstein - hilbert truncation amounts to considering only functionals of the form @xmath32=\\left(16\\pi",
    "g_k\\right)^{-1}\\int d^dx\\,\\sqrt{g}\\left\\ { -r(g)+2\\bar{\\lambda}_k\\right\\}+\\mbox{classical gauge fixing}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the running newton constant and cosmological constant , respectively .",
    "more general and , therefore , more precise truncations would include higher powers of the curvature tensor as well as nonlocal terms @xcite which are not present classically .",
    "quantum gravity is certainly a particularly interesting topic where exact rg equations can lead to important new insights . as",
    "quantized einstein gravity is perturbatively nonrenormalizable a natural option is to consider it an effective field theory @xcite .",
    "already within this setting quantum effects can be studied in a consistent and predictive way .",
    "in fact , in refs .",
    "@xcite the running couplings @xmath33 and @xmath34 obtained in @xcite were used to investigate how quantum gravity effects modify the structure of black holes , and in @xcite the implications for the cosmology of the planck era in the very early universe were studied . along a different line of research",
    "it has been proposed @xcite that there are strong quantum gravitational effects also in the later stages of the cosmological evolution which even might drive the cosmological constant to zero dynamically ; the effective average action would be an ideal tool for exploring such infrared effects .",
    "an even more intriguing possibility is that , despite its perturbative nonrenormalizability , quantized gravity exists _ nonperturbatively _ as a fundamental theory .",
    "it would then be mathematically consistent down to arbitrarily small length scales .",
    "a proposal along these lines is weinberg s `` asymptotic safety '' scenario @xcite .",
    "it assumes that there exists a non - gaussian rg fixed point at which the @xmath8 limit can be taken , i.e. that the theory is `` nonperturbatively renormalizable '' in wilson s sense .",
    "asymptotic safety requires that the non - gaussian fixed point is uv attractive ( i.e. attractive for @xmath35 ) for finitely many parameters in the action , i.e. that its uv critical hypersurface is finite dimensional .",
    "this means that the rg trajectories along which the theory can flow as we send the cutoff @xmath5 to infinity are labeled by only finitely many parameters .",
    "therefore the theory is as predictive as any conventionally renormalizable theory ; it is not plagued by the notorious increase of free parameters which is typical of effective theories .",
    "the set of generalized couplings for which the non - gaussian fixed point is uv attractive should include the dimensionless newton constant , @xmath36 , and cosmological constant , @xmath37 .    using the @xmath38-expansion , weinberg showed already long ago that gravity in @xmath39 dimensions @xmath40 is indeed asymptotically safe @xcite .",
    "further progress in this direction , in particular for @xmath41 , was hampered by the lack of an efficient calculational scheme which could be used to search for nonperturbative fixed points .",
    "as a solution to this problem which does not rely on the @xmath38-expansion we propose to use the effective average action in order to find nontrivial fixed points @xmath42 of the gravitational rg flow .",
    "( the dots stand for the infinitely many other couplings which parametrize a generic action functional . ) using this approach , the case @xmath43 was reanalyzed in a more general setting and , more importantly , it was shown that the einstein - hilbert truncation predicts the existence of a non - gaussian fixed point @xmath44 also in dimensions @xmath45 , in particular for @xmath41 @xcite .    the crucial question which arises",
    "is whether this result is an artifact of the truncation used , or if it correctly reflects a property of the full theory .",
    "it is clear that in order to answer this question one would like to include further invariants into the truncation and to check whether the predictions stabilize .    from the technical point of view such calculations",
    "are extremely complicated so that in the present paper we shall use a different method in order to get a first idea about the reliability of the nontrivial fixed point .",
    "we are going to analyze to what extent its location in the @xmath37-@xmath36 plane and its attractivity properties ( critical exponents ) are scheme dependent . here",
    "`` scheme dependence '' refers to the dependence on the cutoff operator @xmath46 used in the derivation of the rg equation .",
    "first of all , @xmath46 is a matrix in the space of irreducible component fields ( see below ) which is not uniquely determined by the general principles .",
    "hence we can vary it to some extent .",
    "in fact , in the present paper we shall introduce a new cutoff ( `` cutoff of type b '' ) whose matrix structure is different from the original one of ref .",
    "@xcite ( `` cutoff of type a '' ) .",
    "either of these cutoffs is proportional to a `` shape function '' @xmath47 which describes the `` thinning out '' of degrees of freedom as we pass the threshold @xmath48 . also this function can be varied in order to assess the scheme dependence of the fixed point properties .",
    "while in general only the critical exponents but not the location @xmath42 of the fixed point are expected to be universal , i.e. scheme independent @xcite , we shall argue that the product @xmath49 is an observable quantity as well . for observables",
    "the @xmath46-dependence is a pure truncation artifact ; in an exact treatment all @xmath46-dependencies cancel",
    ". the status of the einstein - hilbert truncation would be rather questionable if the fixed point was present for some cutoffs but absent for others .",
    "instead , we find that it is actually there for all admissible cutoffs , and moreover that the observable @xmath49 is scheme independent with a quite unexpected precision .",
    "our results strongly support the conjecture that the non - gaussian fixed point is present in the exact theory and is not a truncation artifact .",
    "also another prerequisite of asymptotic safety turns out to be satisfied : we find that , for any cutoff , the fixed point is uv attractive in both directions of the @xmath37-@xmath36 plane .",
    "ultimately one would like to use more general truncations than ( [ in2 ] ) in order to study the rg flow in a larger subspace .",
    "typically this requires computations whose algebraic complexity is quite formidable .",
    "assume we make an ansatz @xmath50 containing @xmath51 diffeomorphism invariant functionals @xmath52 $ ] . in order to project",
    "the rg flow on the @xmath51-dimensional space with coordinates @xmath53 we must insert the ansatz into the rhs of the flow equation ( [ in1 ] ) . at this point the nontrivial problem , both conceptually and computationally , is to expand the trace with respect to a complete set of actions , @xmath54\\}$ ] , in such a way that the @xmath55 s retained in the ansatz are a subset of the @xmath56 s .",
    "the coefficients of the remaining @xmath56 s , those not present in @xmath1 , are set to zero by the truncation . in practice",
    "the projection on the @xmath57-subspace is done by inserting a set of metrics @xmath58 on both sides of eq .",
    "@xmath59([in1 ] ) which give a nonzero value only to specific linear combinations of the @xmath55 s .",
    "provided one manages to compute the functional trace for sufficiently many @xmath60-pairs one can then deduce the ordinary differential equations for the generalized couplings @xmath61 .    for the einstein - hilbert truncation",
    "this procedure is fairly simple since ( ignoring the running of the gauge parameter ) it is sufficient to insert for @xmath62 the metric of a family of spheres @xmath63 parametrized by their radius @xmath64 .",
    "their maximal symmetry facilitates the calculations considerably . with @xmath64",
    "kept as a free parameter , these metrics are general enough to disentangle @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "but already when we include invariants with four derivatives of the metric this method fails : the spheres can not distinguish @xmath67 from @xmath68 , for instance .",
    "these remarks hint at ( at least ) two major problems which one faces in generalizations of the exact rg approach to gravity .",
    "( i ) the momentum dependent `` mass '' term @xmath69 $ ] depends quadratically on the metric fluctuation @xmath70 , but also , via @xmath71 $ ] on the background @xmath72 . in general",
    "it is a quite nontrivial task to construct a cutoff operator @xmath73 $ ] which has the desired properties mentioned above for a class of background metrics @xmath72 general enough for the projection on the truncation subspace .",
    "( ii ) assume we found an appropriate @xmath73 $ ] .",
    "then there arises the computational problem of evaluating the trace on the rhs of the rg equation for various @xmath26 s and @xmath72 s .",
    "these metrics do not coincide when we allow for an evolution of the gauge fixing sector .",
    "even if we ignore this complication , the hessian @xmath24 under the trace is an extremely complicated nonminimal covariant matrix differential operator constructed from the curvature tensor and covariant derivatives @xmath74 .",
    "a priori , even for maximally symmetric backgrounds , not all derivatives @xmath74 are contracted to form powers of the covariant laplacian @xmath75 , and @xmath24 is not diagonal in the space of fields with a definite helicity therefore .",
    "hence standard heat kernel techniques or perhaps information about the spectrum of @xmath76 are of no help at this point .",
    "in this paper we outline a general strategy for tackling these problems .",
    "it is based upon york s `` tt - decomposition '' @xcite which is available on ( almost ) every spacetime manifold needed for our projection method .",
    "the idea is to decompose the fluctuation @xmath70 into a transverse , traceless tensor @xmath77 , a longitudinal - transverse tensor ( parametrized by a transverse vector @xmath78 ) , a longitudinal - longitudinal tensor ( parametrized by a scalar @xmath79 ) , and a trace part ( parametrized by another scalar @xmath80 ) . in the basis of",
    "the component fields @xmath81 , all @xmath74 s appear in powers of the laplacian only , at least for the class of maximally symmetric backgrounds .",
    "the important point is that this decomposition can be used in order to simplify the structure of @xmath24 on essentially all backgrounds , not just on spheres .",
    "( on @xmath63 the tt - decomposition boils down to the familiar decomposition of @xmath70 with respect to pieces which are irreducible under the isometry group so(@xmath82 ) . in some of the work following the original paper @xcite this decomposition on @xmath63 had been used already @xcite . )",
    "compared to @xmath63 a certain complication arises , however , because the tt - decomposition is nonorthogonal in general .",
    "the tt - decomposition also helps in solving the first problem , the construction of @xmath46 , because @xmath13 has a much simpler structure when expressed in terms of the component fields rather than the original @xmath70 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .    in the first part ( sections [ s2 ] and [ s3 ] ) we describe the construction of a new rg equation where the component fields @xmath83 are used from the outset . along the way we discuss the problems related to a proper identification of @xmath13 .",
    "this part of the paper is meant to supply a set of tools which will become indispensable in future investigations when one includes further invariants into the truncation ( @xmath84-terms @xcite , for instance ) , if one adds matter fields , or if one allows for a running gauge fixing .    as a first application",
    ", we revisit the einstein - hilbert truncation in the second part of the paper ( sections [ s4 ] and [ s5 ] ) .",
    "we introduce a new cutoff @xmath46 which is natural in the tt - language , and we use an arbitrary gauge parameter .",
    "this allows for a nontrivial comparison of the resulting rg equations and their fixed point properties with those of @xcite whose cutoff operator @xmath46 has a rather different structure .",
    "we find both a gaussian and a non - gaussian fixed point in the @xmath85-system and we perform a detailed analysis of their properties , in particular of their scheme dependence .",
    "the chances for realizing the asymptotic safety scenario in 4 dimensions will be discussed in detail .    in section [ s6 ]",
    "we investigate the implications of the non - gaussian fixed point for the effective graviton propagator at large momenta .",
    "a kind of dimensional reduction from 4 to 2 dimensions takes place in the vicinity of this fixed point .",
    "the asymptotic form of the propagator suggests that when 4-dimensional spacetime is probed by a very high - energetic graviton it appears to be effectively 2-dimensional .",
    "various technical results , needed in the present paper but presented also with an eye towards future applications @xcite , are relegated to a set of appendices .    at this point",
