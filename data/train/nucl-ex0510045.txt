    "the study of correlations and fluctuations is expected to provide additional information on the reaction mechanism of high energy nuclear collisions @xcite . in particular , many proposed event - by - event fluctuation observables have already been analyzed @xcite .",
    "more recently , another important measure of correlations , the balance function ( bf ) , was introduced by bass , danielewicz and pratt @xcite .",
    "it measures the correlation of the oppositely charged particles produced during a heavy ion collision and its width can be related to the time of hadronization .",
    "the bf is derived from the charge correlation function that was used to study the hadronization of jets in p+p collisions at the isr @xcite and @xmath0 annihilations at petra @xcite .",
    "the first results on the bf were obtained for au+au collisions by the star collaboration at rhic @xcite and for pb+pb collisions by the na49 collaboration at the cern - sps @xcite .",
    "the motivation for studying the balance function comes from the idea that hadrons are produced locally as oppositely charged particle pairs .",
    "particles of such a pair are separated in rapidity due to the initial momentum difference and secondary interactions with other particles .",
    "particles of a pair that were created earlier are separated further in rapidity because of the expected large initial momentum difference and the long lasting rescattering phase . on the other hand ,",
    "oppositely charged particle pairs that were created later are correlated within a smaller interval @xmath1 of the relative rapidity .",
    "our aim is to measure the degree of this separation of the balancing charges and to find possible indications for delayed hadronization .    in order to examine the pseudo - rapidity ( @xmath2 ) correlation of charged particles",
    "the bf is defined as the difference of the correlation function of oppositely charged particles and the correlation function of like - charge particles normalized to the total number of particles .",
    "the definition of the bf reads @xcite :    @xmath3 . \\label{bf_def2}\\ ] ]    the most interesting property of the bf is its width .",
    "early stage hadronization is expected to result in a broad bf , while late stage hadronization leads to a narrower distribution @xcite .",
    "the width of the bf can be characterized by the weighted average @xmath4 :    @xmath5    where _ i _ is the bin number of the bf histogram .    in the following sections we will first describe in brief the na49 experimental setup .",
    "the next two sections will be dedicated to the new na49 experimental results on the rapidity and the energy dependence of the balance function .",
    "we will conclude with the summary .",
    "the na49 detector @xcite is a wide acceptance hadron spectrometer for the study of hadron production in collisions of hadrons or heavy ions at the cern sps .",
    "the main components are four large - volume time projection chambers ( tpcs ) ( fig .",
    "[ na49_setup ] ) which are capable of detecting 80% of some 1500 charged particles created in a central pb+pb collision at 158__a _ _ gev .",
    "the targets are c ( 561 mg/@xmath6 ) , si ( 1170 mg/@xmath6 ) disks and a pb ( 224 mg/@xmath6 ) foil for ion collisions and a liquid hydrogen cylinder ( length 20 cm ) for hadron interactions .",
    "they are positioned about 80 cm upstream from vtpc-1 .",
    "the centrality of a collision is selected ( on - line for central pb+pb , si+si and c+c and off - line for minimum bias pb+pb , si+si and c+c interactions ) by a trigger using information from a downstream calorimeter ( vcal ) , which measures the energy @xmath7 of the projectile spectator nucleons .",
    "in order to investigate the properties of hadronization in heavy ion collisions , as proposed by the bf methodology @xcite , we studied the system size and centrality dependence of the width of the bf at two sps energies ( @xmath8 gev and @xmath9 gev ) and in two different pseudo - rapidity intervals .",
    "the defined pseudo - rapidity regions for the highest energy are @xmath10 named as mid - rapidity region and @xmath11 as forward rapidity region .",
    "the corresponding pseudo - rapidity regions for the second energy are @xmath12 ( mid - rapidity region ) and @xmath13 ( forward rapidity region ) .",

    "there is a clear decrease of the width with increasing centrality for real data in the mid - rapidity region while this dependence vanishes in the forward region .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    for the smaller systems , such as p+p , c+c , si+si , there is no significant difference in the widths between the two rapidity regions at both energies .",
    "a difference in the widths appears only in the more central pb+pb collisions for both cases .",
    "finally , an attempt was made to study the energy dependence of the balance function with the na49 detector in the most central pb+pb events over the whole available sps energy range .",
    "these data samples were also passed through the shuffling mechanism @xcite to obtain an estimate of the highest possible value of the width for each energy .",
    "the pseudo - rapidity interval analyzed for each energy was limited to the same range ( 1.4 units ) and was located around mid - rapidity . in order to quantify the decrease of the width for the different energies",

    "in addition , two models were used in order to further investigate this energy dependence .",
    "the ultra - relativistic quantum molecular dynamics model ( urqmd ) @xcite and the hadron - string dynamics ( hsd ) transport approach @xcite are two microscopic models used to simulate ( ultra)relativistic heavy ion collisions in the energy range from bevalac and sis up to ags , sps and rhic .",

    "the corresponding rhic point tends to be even higher than the last sps one , indicating an additional rise of the w parameter towards rhic leaving an open question for the lhc energies .",
    "in this paper , we presented the latest results on the bf obtained by the na49 collaboration .",
    "we have analyzed data coming from different systems and centrality classes for two different energies in central and forward rapidity regions . we have observed a system size and centrality dependence of the width of the bf in the mid - rapidity region which is not seen in the forward region .",
    "furthermore , the energy scan revealed that data show an indication of an energy dependence which is not reproduced by the hsd and urqmd models .",
