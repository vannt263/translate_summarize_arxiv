    "<S> in cosmic inflation driven by a scalar gauge singlet field with a tree level higgs potential , the scalar to tensor ratio @xmath0 is estimated to be larger than @xmath1 , provided the scalar spectral index @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss quantum smearing of these predictions arising from the inflaton couplings to other particles such as gut scalars , and show that these corrections can significantly decrease @xmath0 . </S>",

    "<S> these couplings , through quantum corrections ( smearing ) , modify the tree level inflationary potential and therefore the corresponding predictions for the scalar spectral index @xmath4 , tensor to scalar ratio @xmath0 ( measure of gravity waves ) , and the running of the spectral index @xmath5 . in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , it was shown that quantum corrections of the chaotic inflationary potential , computed ala coleman - weinberg @xcite , and induced via couplings of the inflaton to other fields can significantly modify the tree level inflationary predictions . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , in the case of chaotic @xmath6 inflation @xcite supplemented by a yukawa interaction , the tree level prediction of @xmath7 and @xmath8 is replaced by @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a similar analysis has also been carried out for a non - supersymmetric hybrid inflationary model in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where inclusion of these quantum corrections is shown to allow even sub - planckian values of the inflaton field , consistent with the red tilted spectral index exhibited in the wmap 7 year ( wmap7 ) results @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of a suitable yukawa coupling , especially one involving right handed neutrinos , has one significant feature as far as realistic inflation model building is concerned . </S>",
    "<S> while enabling the transition from an inflaton to a radiation dominated universe , the decay products in this case contain right handed neutrinos whose subsequent out of equilibrium decay can give rise to the observed baryon asymmetry via leptogenesis ( thermal @xcite or non - thermal @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown in @xcite that even though the radiative corrections during inflation may be sub - dominant , they can make sizeable corrections to the tree level predictions for @xmath4 and @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is interesting to analyze the effects of these radiative corrections for various realistic inflationary models .    motivated by the above observations , we investigate in this letter the impact of quantum corrections on the predictions of a higgs inflation model in which a gauge singlet scalar @xmath11 plays the role of the inflaton field . for a tree level treatment of this model , </S>",
    "<S> see refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where it is shown that @xmath11 field has a trans - planckian vacuum expectation value . here </S>",
    "<S> we mainly consider the two important interaction terms of @xmath11 in the renormalizable lagrangian : a quartic interaction between @xmath11 and a gut symmetry breaking scalar boson @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) , and a yukawa interaction between @xmath11 and a right handed majorana neutrino @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that in order to obtain significant radiative corrections , both the @xmath12 and @xmath14 fields should be heavier than inflaton , and hence do not significantly contribute to reheating . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we keep the right handed neutrinos light enough to participate in reheating , while letting the gut scalar boson be heavy enough to produce considerable radiative corrections . </S>",
    "<S> these radiative corrections are then shown to have a significant impact on the tree level predictions of @xmath4 , @xmath0 and d@xmath16 </S>",
    "<S> . a very precise measurement of @xmath4 would be an extremely useful first step in the search for the correct inflation model . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath4 can be determined very precisely , say by the planck satellite experiment , the different predictions for @xmath0 which we report here would be an effective way to look for the quantum smearing effects that we have considered . </S>",
    "<S> in practice , we find that for @xmath2 , the scalar to tensor ratio @xmath3 , which can be tested by the planck satellite .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider the lagrangian density @xcite @xmath17 where the subscript ` b ' denotes bare quantities , and @xmath12 represents the gut symmetry breaking scalar boson . </S>",
    "<S> the gut symmetry is broken when @xmath12 acquires a non - zero vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath18 . in order to keep the discussion simple , </S>",
    "<S> we have introduced a single right handed neutrino @xmath14 with yukawa coupling @xmath19 , and we ignore the bare mass terms for @xmath12 and @xmath14 . in a more realistic scenario , successful </S>",
    "<S> leptogenesis requires at least two right - handed neutrinos .    </S>",
    "<S> the inflationary potential including one loop corrections @xcite , in terms of renormalized quantities , can be written as @xmath20 where @xmath21 we have assumed @xmath22 and @xmath23 so that the radiative correction from inflaton self couplings is suppressed @xcite . also , with @xmath24 </S>",

    "<S> furthermore , if we require the potential to be zero at @xmath31 , i.e. @xmath32 , the value of @xmath27 is determined and the potential then takes the following form @xmath33 ^ 2 + a\\,\\phi^4\\,\\left [ \\ln \\left(\\frac{\\phi}{m}\\right ) -\\frac{1}{4 } \\right ] + \\frac{a\\,m^4}{4},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 . </S>",

    "<S> this condition is trivially met for the @xmath36 case in which we are interested . </S>",
    "<S> the first term in the above potential is the usual tree level higgs potential , whereas the second term is the coleman - weinberg potential ( cwp ) , and embodies the radiative corrections .    for the sake of completeness we first review some of the salient features and predictions of tree level higgs inflation . </S>",

    "<S> the predicted values of various parameters of the tree level higgs inflation can be obtained by using eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ hp]-[perturb ] ) above , and these are displayed in table [ tablei ] . </S>",
    "<S> as we see , the quantities @xmath31 , @xmath49 and @xmath51 carry trans - planckian values but still the vacuum energy scale during observable inflation is well below @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the quantum gravity effects are relatively unimportant here . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , very low values of the reheat temperature @xmath75 gev @xmath76 gev are realized with the yukawa coupling @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> since we only consider the right handed majorana neutrinos for reheating , we obtain negligible radiative corrections with their masses @xmath78 ( or the yukawa coupling @xmath79 ) . </S>",
    "<S> taking the number of e - foldings @xmath54 between 50 to 60 , we obtain @xmath80 and @xmath81 within the wmap7 1@xmath82 bounds as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ tlhp ] . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we only show the bv branch in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ tlhp ] which lies largely within the wmap7 1@xmath82 bounds , whereas , the av branch remains outside of the wmap7 1@xmath82 bounds @xcite at tree level . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we mainly restrict our discussion to the wmap7 1@xmath82 bounds .    </S>",
    "<S> the various limits of tree level higgs inflation has been discussed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , for @xmath83 , the bv branch approaches the effective potential of new inflation @xmath84 in a region disfavored by wmap7 . on the other hand , for @xmath85 , </S>",
    "<S> the av branch approaches the effective potential of quartic inflation @xmath86 . as mentioned above this av branch </S>",
    "<S> lies outside of the wmap7 1-@xmath82 bounds . </S>",
    "<S> finally , near the vev we obtain an effective potential of quadratic inflation @xmath87 , where @xmath88 denotes the deviation of the field from the minimum and @xmath89 is the inflaton mass . </S>",
    "<S> this chaotic inflationary model @xcite predicts @xmath90 gev , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 , corresponding to @xmath94 gev@xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact this is the region in which the two branches meet , i.e. both the bv and av branches converge to quadratic inflation in the high-@xmath27 limit .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now investigate the effect of including quantum smearing to the tree level higgs inflation . in general we may consider two types of radiative corrections : fermionic radiative corrections ( which arise from the yukawa interaction that couples @xmath11 to fermions ) and bosonic radiative corrections ( which arise from the quartic interaction between @xmath11 and other bosons ) . as we see in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ a ] ) , these radiative corrections appear in the potential with opposite signs and also exhibit different behavior in various inflationary predictions . </S>",
    "<S> these corrections become important around @xmath96 and if we consider the bosonic radiative corrections only , the mass of the gauge scalar boson turns out to be of order the gut scale @xmath97 gev , with @xmath98 and @xmath99 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath100 gev is the planck mass . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , in order to obtain sizable effects with the fermionic radiative corrections we need a yukawa coupling @xmath101 of order @xmath102 . </S>",
    "<S> this , in turn , makes the fermion masses superheavy @xmath103  gev , larger than the inflaton mass @xmath104 gev . </S>",
    "<S> thus , these fermions are unable to participate in the reheating process and are also too heavy for seesaw physics . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , we utilize the right handed majorana neutrinos for reheating , which generates negligible radiative corrections with their masses @xmath78 and the yukawa coupling @xmath79 . in this regard , </S>",
    "<S> the higgs inflationary model is different from the chaotic inflationary model where the same yukawa interaction , responsible for the reheating , has also been shown to make sizable contributions , through radiative corrections , in modifications of the tree level predictions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is related to the fact that the yukawa couplings in the chaotic inflation are not restricted by a non - zero inflaton vev . in the following discussion , therefore , we only consider the effect of bosonic radiative corrections from the gut field @xmath12 .    </S>",
    "<S> the predictions of the bosonic radiatively corrected higgs potential are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ ra ] . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath105 here quantifies the amount of radiative corrections . in order to explore the entire space of smearing , we show in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ ra ] a plot between @xmath0 and log@xmath106 for the values of @xmath4 which lie within the wmap7 1@xmath82 bounds . </S>",
    "<S> as we increase the value of @xmath105 , the tensor to scalar ratio @xmath0 is observed to decrease . </S>",
    "<S> this is contrary to what we usually expect in the chaotic inflationary models where bosonic ( fermionic ) radiative corrections increase ( reduce ) the value of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> actually , the bv branch of the tree level higgs potential and the added bosonic radiative corrections have slopes with opposite signs , which reduces the magnitude of the total slope of the potential and in turn decreases the value of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , both the tree level chaotic inflationary potentials and their bosonic radiative corrections share slopes with same signs and this raises the value of @xmath0 . a similar reduction in @xmath0 has also been observed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite by adding higher order even powers of @xmath11 to the tree level higgs potential . </S>",
    "<S> this reduction is prominent ( insignificant ) for small ( large ) values of the spectral index @xmath4 and the tensor to scalar ratio @xmath0 as a result of an increase ( decrease ) in the value of @xmath105 . </S>",
    "<S> for example , with @xmath107 , @xmath108 @xmath109 , @xmath110 the reduction in @xmath0 is @xmath111 ( @xmath112 ) . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the cwp curve provides an upper bound on @xmath105 for a given value of @xmath4 , as is clear from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ ra ] . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the upper bound on @xmath105 is @xmath113 for the wmap7 central value of spectral index @xmath114 . in the small @xmath105 limit , </S>",
    "<S> all curves reproduce the standard tree level higgs inflation predictions .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ rns2 ] , we fix the value of @xmath105 and vary @xmath115 between zero and its tree level value . </S>",
    "<S> we consider , as an example , three different values of the parameter @xmath116 , @xmath117 , and @xmath118 . </S>",
    "<S> each curve of radiatively corrected higgs potential with constant value of @xmath105 approaches the cwp prediction in the small @xmath115 limit . as is clear from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ rns2 ] , the cwp curve is more contiguous to the central region of wmap7 data in comparison to the tree level higgs potential curve . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ rns2 ] we also include a curve of cwp with @xmath119 which further extends the allowed space towards the central region of 1@xmath82 wmap7 data </S>",
    "<S> . moreover , both the tensor to scalar ratio @xmath0 and the spectral index @xmath4 are observed to decrease with an increase in @xmath105 as explained above . </S>",
    "<S> the predictions of radiatively corrected higgs potential , in fact , interpolate between the tree level higgs potential and the cwp curves .    to see the extent of quantum spread , we provide in table  [ tableiii ] the predicted values of various parameters of this model corresponding to the the wmap7 central value of the spectral index , @xmath114 . </S>",
    "<S> most of the quantities exhibit a small variation from their respective tree level predictions . </S>",
    "<S> however , the the tensor to scalar ratio @xmath0 experiences a significant shift . the tree level prediction of @xmath120 acquires a total quantum spread of @xmath121 with @xmath122 .    </S>",
    "<S> the cwp prediction represents the maximal smearing of the radiatively corrected higgs inflation results . </S>",
    "<S> this model has been studied extensively in the past @xcite and recently @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the predicted values of various parameters of this model are displayed in table [ tableii ] with the number of e - foldings @xmath119 . </S>",
    "<S> similar to tree level higgs inflation , @xmath31 , @xmath49 and @xmath51 carry trans - planckian values with vacuum energy scale well below @xmath74 during observable inflation . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath123 and @xmath124 for the wmap central value of the spectral index @xmath114 .    to summarize , we discuss the effect of including quantum corrections ( smearing ) in the tree level higgs inflation . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to chaotic inflation , a yukawa interaction between inflaton and right handed neutrinos generates negligible radiative corrections owing to light ( @xmath125 ) neutrino masses . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the bosonic radiative corrections , which are obtained from a quartic interaction between inflaton and a gut symmetry breaking scalar boson , can yield noticeable effects . as a result of including these corrections , a reduction in the tensor to scalar ratio </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 is observed . </S>",
    "<S> the coleman - weinberg potential provides , in this case , the maximal quantum smearing limit . using the wmap7 central value of the spectral index @xmath114 , the tree level prediction of @xmath126 </S>",
    "<S> is replaced by @xmath121 . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that while working with high precision observations such as the current planck satellite experiment we can not ignore these radiative corrections in analyzing the predictions of various inflationary models . </S>"
