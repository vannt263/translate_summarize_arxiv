    "josephson junctions ( jjs ) were proposed as threshold detectors of the full counting statistics ( fcs ) by tobiska and nazarov @xcite and independently by pekola @xcite in 2004 . since",
    "then there has been continuing effort to implement the proposed schemes experimentally as well as to improve them and better understand their potential theoretically . the original scheme by tobiska and nazarov @xcite proposed using overdamped jj as the threshold detector .",
    "this appears to be problematic since in the overdamped junction when the effective phase particle overcomes the tilted washboard potential barrier it gets immediately retrapped in the adjacent minimum .",
    "this results in the phase diffusion which , however , does not yield enough sensitivity for detecting the whole fcs .",
    "this could in principle be overcome by employing a negative - inductance device which apparently hasnt appealed to the experimentalists enough to actually implement it .",
    "instead they opted for an obvious alternative to use underdamped junctions where , under suitable conditions , once the particle overcomes the first barrier it keeps on sliding down the potential thus producing finite voltage .",
    "thus , the switching of an underdamped junction between the supercurrent ( static phase ) and running ( finite phase velocity , i.e.  finite voltage ) state would provide a prime example of a threshold detector .",
    "unfortunately , this innocently - looking change in the setup dramatically changes the level of difficulties involved in the theoretical analysis .",
    "this paper addresses those difficulties in some detail .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following . in the next section [ sec2 ]",
    "i report the theoretical concept of calculating the non - equilibrium escape rate due to a non - gaussian noise source whose fcs is to be determined . the general theory based on the wkb - like approximation for the weak noise intensity",
    "is further carried out to an analytical result in case of the linear perturbation theory in the third cumulant for very weak junction damping in subsection [ subsec21 ] . in this subsection",
    "i also make comparison with alternative existing theories . in the next subsection [ subsec22 ]",
    "the full theory is numerically implemented and the numerical results in an experimentally relevant regime are discussed and further compared with various analytical predictions . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "i briefly raise some experimentally relevant questions such as what is the effect on the rate asymmetry of the nominally subleading terms entering the rate and whether one can actually experimentally leave the linear regime and achieve the measurement of the whole fcs of a noise source . in the last section [ concl ]",
    "i summarize what has been achieved in this work and review the remaining open problems .",
    "the josephson element in an electrical circuit is often modeled as a current biased ( @xmath0 ) resistively ( @xmath1 ) and capacitively ( @xmath2 ) shunted ideal jj with the josephson current - phase relation @xmath3 .",
    "the voltage across the junction is determined by the second josephson relation @xmath4 with the time - derivative denoted by the dot . moreover , due to the action of ubiquitous thermal ( gaussian ) noise @xmath5 characterized by the temperature @xmath6 and non - equilibrium electronic noise @xmath7 from the measured device whose fcs is to be determined , the jj is subjected to stochastic forces and its dynamics is thus described by the following langevin equation ( rcsj model ) @xmath8 in a realistic experimental situation the current - bias assumption can be inadequate and one may need to generalize the above model .",
    "the general consequences of an imperfect current bias are so called environmental or ",
    "cascade \" corrections to the measured cumulants of the source fcs which were studied in previous works @xcite .",
    "they could be straightforwardly included here in the same spirit as in those works , especially ref .",
    "@xcite , but since they appear to be of minor importance in the so far reported experiments i will neglect them .    in this study",
    "i will consider in detail exclusively the simplest case of the poissonian shot noise @xmath7 corresponding to the measured device being a tunnel junction .",
    "in such a case @xmath7 is just a train of @xmath9-function - like spikes which are separated by an exponentially distributed waiting time with a single parameter ( mean waiting time ) being the mean ( particle ) current @xmath10 flowing through the tunnel junction .",
    "this case is also the only one studied experimentally by this type experiments to date . assuming the temporal width of the pulses composing @xmath7 to be very small compared to a characteristic time of the junction dynamics ( which is its plasma frequency @xmath11 )",
    "one can obtain a master equation ( analogous to the fokker - planck equation in case of gaussian noise only ) for the probability density @xmath12 in dimensionless units @xmath13 @xmath14w,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath15 the rescaled bias current , @xmath16 the quality factor of the ( unbiased ) junction and @xmath17 with the josephson energy of the junction proportional to the critical current @xmath18 .",
    "the last term in the equation can be identified as stemming from the cumulant generating function of the poissonian process @xmath19 and the eq .",
    "( [ fpeq ] ) holds for the positive polarity of the tunneling current .",
    "the opposite polarity would just change the sign in the exponential in eq .",
    "( [ fpeq ] ) . ] which suggests how to deal with non - poissonian noise source provided the markovian approximation is made .",
    "thus , the substitution @xmath20\\rightarrow f(-\\lambda\\partial/\\partial v)$ ] for general noise sources described by the cumulant generating function @xmath21 generalizes the particular results shown here for the poissonian process to arbitrary noise sources as long as the markovian approximation is justified @xcite .    in order to calculate the escape rates of the junction from the supercurrent branch ( zero voltage state with a static phase @xmath22 ) to the running state ( finite voltage across the junction with non - zero phase velocity @xmath23 ) in the low noise limit we use the standard technique known as the singular perturbation theory in the mathematical literature @xcite or as wkb method in the physical context @xcite .",
    "it consists in making the ansatz @xmath24 $ ] for the probability density @xmath12 with @xmath25 being a small parameter related to the noise intensity : @xmath26 .",
    "thus , @xmath25 is a dimensionless effective temperature of the junction due to the summed effect of the thermal noise and the gaussian part of the non - equilibrium noise @xcite . when this ansatz is put into eq .",
    "( [ fpeq ] ) and the lowest order in @xmath25 is only retained ( corresponding to the wkb approximation and justified for small @xmath27 ) we obtain the following hamilton - jacobi ( hj ) equation , i.e.  a first order partial differential equation for @xmath28 @xmath29 for a general noise source the last term ( given by the sum ) in the preceding equations would be replaced by the corresponding expression @xmath30 , i.e. by the reduced cumulant generating function with the first two moments ( mean current and the zero - frequency noise ) subtracted ( notice that @xmath31 by definition ) .",
    "this hamilton - jacobi equation can be solved via the method of characteristics , i.e. one can recast the equation as a dynamical system in a 4-dimensional phase - space @xmath32 $ ] governed by the auxiliary hamiltonian @xmath33 the coordinates @xmath34 and their conjugated momenta @xmath35 are then evolving according to the following equations of motion @xmath36 the exponential part of the non - equilibrium escape rate is in this language determined by the difference of the stationary , i.e.time-independent , action between the barrier top and the metastable minimum of the tilted washboard potential , i.e.  @xmath37 @xcite which can be either determined by the direct solution of eq .",

    "i will demonstrate both methods in the next two subsections . at this point",
    "i would like to stress that the overdamped analog of the present problem ( with @xmath41 in eq .",
    "( [ langevin_eq ] ) when the inertial term @xmath42 can be neglected ) studied in ref .",
    "@xcite is integrable since analogous equations to ( [ hjeq ] ) , ( [ eom ] ) are to be solved in a 2-dimensional phase - space only and with the help of the stationarity constraint @xmath43 one easily finds the action in eq .",
    "( [ hjeq ] ) by a quadrature for an arbitrary strength of the non - equilibrium noise .",
    "unfortunately , this property does not carry over to the underdamped case where the energy constraint is not sufficient for integrability .",
    "therefore , the underdamped problem is conceptually far more difficult than the originally suggested overdamped model .      in this subsection",
    "i will present a linear perturbation theory of the rate asymmetry which is an alternative to the similar previous approaches by a number of authors @xcite .",
    "i will use this limiting case for the illustration of the general method , which will be fully developed in the next subsection , and , at the same time , for pointing out possible discrepancies in the previous studies . as a by - product i will present a new analytical formula for the rate asymmetry in the very low damping limit @xmath44 .    following the previous studies we consider the linear correction to the escape rate due to a weak third cumulant . to this end",
    "we truncate the sum in the stationary version of the hj equation ( [ hjeq ] ) to the first order , i.e.  we consider the effects of the third cumulant @xmath45 only .",
    "further , we formulate the linear perturbation theory for an arbitrary potential @xmath46 in which the effective particle moves  the present case is then recovered by the choice of the tilted washboard potential describing the jj ( in dimensionless units ) @xmath47 .",
    "the resulting hj then reads @xmath48 with @xmath49 .",
    "we solve this equation in the linear order in @xmath45 by linearizing the equation .",
    "after inserting @xmath50 into the equation , using the knowledge of the zeroth order solution @xmath51 corresponding to the boltzmann factor due to the thermal gaussian noise , and keeping only the linear terms in @xmath52 one obtains @xmath53\\frac{\\partial s_1}{\\partial      v}\\ .\\ ] ] it is very unlikely that eq .",
    "( [ hjlin ] ) could be solved analytically for general @xmath54 .",
    "ankerhold @xcite did find certain solution to the problem of the rate asymmetry for any @xmath54 , however , his solution is not a solution of the above equation ( [ hjlin ] ) as i will discuss later on .",
    "indeed , one should not expect finding an explicit analytical solution to eq .",
    "( [ hjlin ] ) for arbitrary @xmath54 since it is generally known that the action @xmath55 ( or the  non - equilibrium potential \" ) develops a dense set of singularities close to the barrier top @xcite .",
    "this does not happen only in the integrable cases which is certainly the limit @xmath56 corresponding to the one - dimensional spatial diffusion and , hopefully , also for @xmath44 describing the energy diffusion limit , which is effectively one - dimensional again .    here , i give an analytic expression for the solution @xmath57 in the limit @xmath44 for general potential @xmath46 , in particular for the tilted washboard potential without resorting to its cubic approximation employed in previous works @xcite .",
    "we look for the solution of eq .",
    "( [ hjlin ] ) with @xmath44 in the form @xmath58 and find a closed set of equations @xmath59 the solution @xmath60 contains two arbitrary constants @xmath61 .",
    "moreover , one can add an arbitrary solution of the homogeneous part of eq .",
    "( [ hjlin ] ) to this particular solution .",
    "solutions to the homogeneous problem are arbitrary ( sufficiently smooth and differentiable ) functions of the particle energy @xmath62 , thus , the freedom in the particular solution can be absorbed into the homogeneous solution since it just represent a linear function of the energy .",
    "the arbitrariness stemming from the mathematical solution must be fixed by physical requirements .",
    "first , all physical quantities must be  gauge invariant \" meaning that an arbitrary constant shift in the potential @xmath63 can not change the physical observables . those are changes of @xmath57 between different points in the phase - space , i.e.  not just @xmath57 itself , rather its partial derivatives @xmath64 and @xmath65 . the conditions to be satisfied are then @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "both lead to the same equation @xmath68 with the linear function solution .",
    "this way , we recover the freedom stemming from the particular solution but the larger freedom of the homogeneous solution has been removed .",
    "the remaining uncertainty , being basically just the choice of the origin of integration @xmath69 , since the constant @xmath2 is harmless , is fixed by the requirement that in the vicinity of the potential minimum , where the potential can be approximated as harmonic , all the gaussian averages ( i.e.@xmath70 ) of the original fokker - planck / master equation must stay intact by the third cumulant . in the harmonic regime , this is a necessary consequence of the linearity of the underlying langevin equation .",
    "this condition implies that the origin of integration must be identical with the potential minimum @xmath71 . in total ,",
    "one finally has @xmath72 yielding for the exponential part of the rate asymmetry @xmath73 ( factor of 2 stands for the sum of the two equal contributions to the asymmetry from the two opposite polarities of the measured current ) @xmath74 = \\exp\\left[2 d_1(s ) e_j^2 < \\!\\!<\\!i_m^3\\!>\\!\\!>/c i_0(k_b t_{\\rm eff})^3\\right]$ ] with the function @xmath75 introduced in ref .",

    "although the difference is not severe being on the order of 10% only and , therefore , practically most likely irrelevant , from the conceptual point of view it matters because all the works claim to calculate the same quantity for the very same model and , thus , the correct result should be unique .",
    "it s not simple to follow and reproduce sj s approach but grabert s method is very transparent and i have fully recovered his numerical findings",
    ". minor generalization of his approach to the full tilted washboard potential ( grabert uses the usual cubic approximation to the tilted - washboard potential for a large bias @xmath82 ) gives @xmath77 ( within numerical precision ) and @xmath81 for @xmath82 .",
    "the discrepancy with the above analytical result is thus not a problem of the numerical precision of works @xcite but a conceptual problem .",

    "( [ hjlin ] ) one can easily find that the set of equations obtained for @xmath84 s is internally inconsistent ( suggesting that the truncation at the third power in @xmath85 in the ansatz is insufficient ) for a general @xmath54 and potential @xmath46 . ) .",
    "] there are several exceptions when the inconsistencies are removed , namely for a strictly harmonic potential @xmath86 ( this potential does nt exhibit a barrier , at least not a smooth one approximating the tilted washboard potential ) and in the limits either @xmath56 or @xmath44 .",

    "its detailed comparison with the numerically exact solution will be shown in the next subsection .",
    "now , we turn to the general case of the calculation of the rate asymmetry for an arbitrary intensity of the non - equilibrium noise acting on the junction .",
    "this is achieved by the numerical solution of the effective dynamical system equations ( [ eom ] ) . as already mentioned the solution",
    "consists in finding a trajectory satisfying the equations of motion ( [ eom ] ) and connecting in infinite time ( corresponding to the zero auxiliary energy @xmath38 ) the two fix - points @xmath39 $ ] and @xmath40 $ ] being the ( metastable ) minimum of the potential and the top of the barrier , respectively .",
    "there always exists a classical ,  relaxation \" solution corresponding to the dissipative but noise - free motion of the effective particle from the barrier top down to the minimum .",
    "this solution has @xmath95 and also the associated action is zero .",

    "however , the two trajectories are not simply related and one has to calculate the escape trajectory directly by solving the full system ( [ eom ] ) .",
    "this is exactly done here .",
    "the problem is formulated as a boundary value problem ( bvp ) on an infinite time interval reflecting the stationarity condition of the original escape problem .",

    "( [ eom ] ) and @xmath100 ( [ hamiltonian ] ) and the resulting action is thus expressed solely via the conjugate momentum @xmath101 . the exponential part of the rate asymmetry @xmath102 is then calculated as the difference of the action for two opposite measured current polarities .    technically the bvp is formulated on a long , but finite time interval estimated by the shooting solution used for the initial guess , for details see below . at the ends of this time interval the trajectory is assumed to be close enough to the respective fix - point so that the linear approximation to the equations of motion ( [ eom ] ) can be employed .",
    "the linearized system is then characterized by the stability analysis which identifies stable / unstable directions and corresponding eigenvalues .",
    "the boundary conditions at the ends of the time interval are then formulated with help of the respective linearized system in the spirit of the study @xcite , sec .",
    "iv , i.e.  the 2-dimensional unstable ( stable ) manifold around the minimum ( maximum ) is identified and the solution is required to lie in them which yields two boundary conditions at each fix - point .",
    "solution of the bvp is then sought for by a relaxation method with the ` bvp4c ' built - in solver in matlab @xcite .",
    "the solver needs a very good initial guess for the solution to converge at all .",
    "when it does , it is very fast and efficient . without a good initial",
    "guess it usually does not converge , especially for very large @xmath54 .",
    "thus , the initial guess is the crucial part of the whole solution process . for finding a good initial guess",
    "i solve the bvp by the shooting method first ( in line with a general bvp strategy @xcite ) , i.e. i look for a solution of eq .",
    "( [ eom ] ) by solving an initial value problem starting at the unstable manifold around the minimum and searching for such an initial condition which evolves into the other fix - point around the potential barrier .",
    "finding a solution by the shooting method solely is a rather difficult task due to involved characteristic numerical instabilities around the target fix - point @xcite . indeed",
    ", the found solution is typically not precise enough to be of any use for the evaluation of the rates , however , it usually suffices as a good enough initial guess to ensure the convergence of the relaxation method .",
    "moreover , the solution found by the shooting method gives a good estimate for the time needed to join the two linearized manifolds around the respective fix - points , a task which is not obvious how to accomplish otherwise .",
    "after solving the problem at this fixed long time interval i include corrections due to the rests of the infinite time interval at the beginning and the end , respectively , by analytically evaluating the associated quadratic action exactly analogously to the method of ref .",
    "@xcite , sec . v. these corrections , although relatively small , are necessary within the precision required by the problem .",
    "the last technical detail concerns the handling of the ( non)uniqueness of the solution . since the system ( [ eom ] ) is autonomous it has an infinite number of solutions related by a simple time - translation , i.e. if @xmath97 $ ] is a solution then for an arbitrary @xmath103 shift in time @xmath104 $ ] is also a solution .",
    "this liberty may confuse the relaxation solver and , thus , it is advisory to fix the solution by explicit breaking of the time invariance @xcite .",
    "i achieved this  locally \" by fixing the phase of the oscillatory solution at the unstable manifold around the potential minimum both in the boundary conditions as well as in the initial value problem .",
    "time shift by the period of the local oscillations remains to be a symmetry operation but the continuous symmetry with an arbitrary shift is this way broken .",
    "this trick does help to stabilize the solution , nevertheless , despite of all the tricks used the numerical implementation is still not absolutely stable and one can occasionally run into problems of non - convergence , especially with increasing value of @xmath54 .",
    "this is not so surprising since for large @xmath54 the time span needed to connect the two linearized neighborhoods of the fix - points becomes longer and the solution in between exhibits ever increasing number of oscillations .",
    "further , due to the linear regime in which the problem is to be solved to describe current experiments the effect of non - gaussian noise leads only to very small asymmetry effects and this requires rather high precision of the calculations which stretches the used method to its limits",
    ". further improvement of the numerical method is thus an interesting and urging open issue in the solution of the present problem . during the upon2008 conference i became aware of the work by the lancaster group @xcite which has apparently developed a toolbox of methods for tackling even far more difficult problems of escape . while i developed some of the techniques they use independently",
    ", there seem to be some more left to explore",
    ". it will be interesting to see whether those techniques , such as the action plot concept @xcite , will be successful in improving the present numerics .",
    "my naive fast implementation attempts have failed thus far .",
    "the main difference of the present problem from most established techniques , including the lancaster group s ones , seems to lie in the presence of non - gaussian noise and the task to actually employ and characterize its effects on the escape characteristics .",
    "it s unclear at this point how seriously this fact influences the feasibility and/or performance of those techniques developed predominantly for gaussian problems .    for this moment",

    "the fast inspection of both figures reveals that the logarithm of the asymmetry @xmath102 presented there is generally a small quantity with a typical magnitude of about 10% .",
    "this is consistent with the usage of the linear response theories ( in the third cumulant ) employed in previous studies @xcite .",
    "the curves are not , however , linear functions of the measured current @xmath114 due to the fact that the current contributes also to the effective temperature ( and it is an important contribution ) which enters the formula for the asymmetry linear in the third cumulant ( proportional to @xmath114 as well for the tunnel junction ) .",
    "moreover , there is another source of nonlinearity in the curve , namely the fact that experimentalists for convenience measure in the range of roughly constant mean escape rate on the order of @xmath115  khz .",

    "[ fig2 ] with @xmath110 this is indeed the case due to more stable numerics but one can see that those two control quantities are not strictly zero for the high - q case .",

    "[ fig1 ] is compared with four different theories grouped into two sets ( within the set they are virtually equal in the @xmath44 limit ) .",
    "it is ( generalized numerical ) evaluation @xmath128 la grabert @xcite together with the result by sukhorukov and jordan @xcite both of which predict basically @xmath129 while the other set is my eq .",
    "( [ d1 ] ) and ankerhold s @xcite result @xmath130 . while the difference in the predictions is only on the order of 10% and , thus , most likely irrelevant for experiments , it is relevant from a purely conceptual point of view which one is actually correct since it should help with the identification of possible misconceptions hidden in the failed approach(es ) . from the data presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] it is clear that the more promising set is the ankerhold - novotn one . despite of the scatter in the data , there are reliable points ( where the control quantities turn into zero ) which are closer to the 8/9-curve .",
    "the numerical calculation did nt use any linear perturbation theory or any approximation at all .",
    "the data are sheer results of the numerical evaluation of the bvp for general values of the parameters .",
    "the discrepancy of the data with the theoretical predictions may be caused by the finite , although rather high , value of @xmath54 .",
    "this can account for the difference between the numerics and 8/9-curve , however , it is inconsistent with grabert s theory which predicts monotonic increase of the asymmetry with increasing @xmath54 , see fig . 4 in ref .",
    "@xcite . moreover , ",
    "grabert s curve \" was calculated for @xmath121 even though it hardly deviates from its limiting @xmath131 counterpart by sj .",
    "thus , the only salvation for the two theories @xcite could come from the numerics being wrong which is in principle possible but does not seem too plausible at this point .",
    "mk and quality factor @xmath110 . for detailed explanation of various quantities and the values of other parameters , which are the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and correspond to the saclay experiment @xcite , see the main text.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    if we now turn to the other fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we see at the first place much better precision of the numerics as revealed by the control quantities being zero .",
    "the numerical data are again compared with grabert s and ankerhold s theories which provide alternatives for finite @xmath54 .",
    "i also show a curve for @xmath131 to demonstrate significant deviations of the results for still relatively high @xmath110 from the infinite-@xmath54 limit .",
    "this should be remembered when interpreting experimental data of , e.g. , the helsinki group @xcite with @xmath132 via @xmath131 theories .",
    "ankerhold s theory ( eq .  ( 13 ) of ref .  @xcite with the 2/3-correction from the erratum ) is off the numerical data as well as grabert s result thus clearly demonstrating only the interpolating status of this theory .",
    "the discrepancy is , however , rather small and , therefore , ankerhold s formula seems to be a very cheap and efficient analytical interpolation scheme for an arbitrary @xmath54 .",
    "grabert s result on the other hand lies exactly on top of the numerical data in stark contrast to its apparent failure for the high-@xmath54 case in fig .",
    "this is somewhat mysterious behavior which certainly deserves better understanding .",
    "what could go wrong in grabert s reasoning ?",
    "i have no clear answer to that , however , i do have a conjecture where there could be a problem hidden .",
    "of course , i am fully aware that the problem could in fact be also in my numerics for @xmath121 although its correspondence with my analytics represented by eq .",
    "( [ d1 ] ) is encouraging and not quite typical for bug - plagued numerics .",
    "grabert s approach uses a straightforward perturbation theory at the level of trajectories connecting the fix - points .",
    "he argues that within the linear response in the third cumulant the equilibrium ( unperturbed ) solution is enough for evaluating the correction to the action . in more detail , provided the auxiliary hamiltonian is split into equilibrium part and non - gaussian perturbation @xmath133 the correction to the action reads @xmath134 ( compare with his eq .",
    "( 77 ) in ref .",
    "this is analogous to the standard first order perturbation theory in quantum mechanics , the correction to energy is just the mean value of the hamiltonian in the unperturbed state .",
    "however , one should recall that this formula is only applicable if the unperturbed state is non - degenerate .",
    "it s not obvious what is the analogous condition for classical trajectories , nevertheless , one may expect certain subtleties involved due to several conditions specific for the current problem .",
    "first of all , the bvp is formulated on an infinite time interval , there exists the continuous time shift symmetry , and the unstable / stable manifolds around the respective fix - points are two - dimensional ( could this be the",
    " degeneracy \" ? ) .",
    "the above formula for @xmath135 can be easily derived for finite time interval with fixed boundary conditions , however , ca nt the infinite time interval bring about omitted surface terms ?",
    "i am quite sure these questions can be successfully handled by dynamical system theory experts .",
    "to this date ( end of june 2008 ) there are two publicly available experimental results by the helsinki group @xcite and by the saclay group @xcite .",
    "the helsinki experiment finds the asymmetry curve as a function of the measured current through the tunnel junction which has its shape in qualitative agreement with all previously mentioned theories ( the @xmath136 difference between different theories is undetectable at the level of precision of the experiment ) .",
    "however , the quantitative comparison with , e.g. , ankerhold s theory shows discrepancy on the order of @xmath137 ( see the comparison in ref .",
    "@xcite , recall the correction factor 2/3 missing in that reference and further account for finite @xmath138 contributing another factor of  1/2 ) .",
    "i havent discussed the theory used by the helsinki group for fitting the experiment since it s conceptually different from all the other discussed theories and i consider it to be semi - phenomenological with the prefactor ( calculated in other theories ) being adjusted to the experimental outcome , thus lacking a real predictive power .",
    "the other experiment by the saclay group has been identified as most likely faulty due to a leak in the measurement circuit which prohibited the reliable determination of the bias current .",
    "such an effect largely overshadows any asymmetry due to the third cumulant and , thus , no quantitatively reliable data are available from this experiment .",
    "regardless of this unsatisfactory status we may consider possible problems which are likely to be encountered , and maybe have already been encountered in the helsinki experiment , when trying to compare the experimental outcome with theoretical predictions .",
    "the first issue is the one of the actual relevance of the exponential part of the rate asymmetry",
    ". clearly , the experiment measures the rate asymmetry , not a theoretical concept of its exponential part .",
    "the rationale behind the dominance of the exponential part of the rate unfortunately does nt necessarily carry over to the _ rate asymmetry _",
    ", especially in the _ linear regime_. the standard argument behind the dominance of the exponential part of ( thermal ) rates is that the large dimensionless barrier entering the exponent simply dominates the whole expression ; moreover , the noise intensity ( temperature ) enters only the exponential part via the boltzmann factor while the prefactor ( attempt frequency ) is temperature - independent .",
    "now consider a weak noise with the third cumulant nonzero .",
    "this weak noise will supposedly weakly modify the rate .",
    "this will in general happen both through the exponent and the prefactor . in the linear response regime in the third cumulant the correction in the exponent can be safely expanded and the resulting linear correction will add to the linear correction stemming from the prefactor . at this stage there is no a priori difference between these two contributions .",
    "of course , in practice one of them ( presumably the prefactor part ) can still be negligible .",
    "what are the prospects for this to happen ?",
    "we have seen that in the realistic setup studied in the previous section the asymmetry due to the exponential part of the rate reaches values on the order of @xmath136 at maximum .",
    "the expected correction due to the prefactor is of the form @xmath139 .",
    "the first factor , dimensionless temperature , is of the order of @xmath140 while the other factor , dimensionless measured current , is of the order of @xmath141 .",
    "thus , in total , we have an effect of the order of @xmath142 which can be , depending on the actual numerical prefactor , comparable to the exponential part .",
    "this somewhat pessimistic scenario can be further supported both by the discrepancy found in the helsinki experiment as well as by the mismatch between ankerhold s theory and direct stochastic simulations performed in connection with the saclay experiment in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see their fig .",
    "7a ) where a multiplicative factor of 2 difference was found for the dimensionless barrier height @xmath143 .",
    "while this value lies at the border of reliability of the wkb approach and corrections for larger barriers ( especially the experimentally relevant one 10.4 ) may be expected , they are not expected to be of order of 100% .",
    "therefore , it seems that the asymmetry stemming from the prefactor may be relevant for experiments .",
    "this is a rather bad news for theoreticians since the calculation of the prefactor for non - equilibrium rates is an involved task , see the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "so we finally come to the question whether one can achieve a nonlinear regime with underdamped jjs .",
    "the problem is apparently in the fact that the effective temperature raises with the measured current in such a way that it simply dominates the escape mechanism and corrections due to higher order cumulants are just negligible .",
    "this is clearly reflected in the plot in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] where the originally growing ( with @xmath114 ) curve for small @xmath114 eventually bends downwards again for larger @xmath114 .",
    "while the first part is governed by the third cumulant growing with @xmath114 , the declining part corresponds to the case when the contribution of @xmath114 to the effective temperature beats the raising third cumulant .",
    "the same effect would be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for larger values of @xmath114 .",
    "this behavior could be diminished by weakening the effect of the measured current on the effective temperature , see the expression for the effective temperature .",
    "this should be achieved by decreasing the value of the effective shunt resistance @xmath1 .",
    "this , in turn , would imply decreasing quality factor which seems experimentally unacceptable beyond the point when the switching ceases to exist and only phase diffusion is present .",
    "the quality factor thus should be maintained at a reasonably high value which can be achieved by increasing capacitance @xmath2 .",
    "that in turn will decrease the third cumulant contribution via the formula preceding eq .",
    "( [ d1 ] ) . at this point",
    "the problem turns into a bad joke .",
    "there may be , however , a parameter window where a subtle compromise can be achieved .",
    "this should be seriously considered by carefully examining different parameter dependencies and testing experimentally acceptable numbers .",
    "in this work i have reviewed in detail the status of the problem of the measurement of the full counting statistics by the switching dynamics of an underdamped josephson junction .",
    "i have presented a general theory for the weak noise based on the wkb - like approximation and calculated the rate asymmetry due to a weak third cumulant analytically in the limit of very high quality factor of the junction .",
    "this calculation has been critically compared to other theories and their possible shortcomings have been identified and pointed out .",
    "further , i have developed a numerical scheme for solving the boundary value problem determining the exponential part of the non - equilibrium escape rate under general circumstances , i.e.  beyond the linear perturbation theory . using this scheme",
    "i have calculated the exponential part of the rate asymmetry for experimentally relevant set of parameters and compared the findings with various linear theories .",
    "again , this helped with the identification of the status of concurrent theories . eventually , i have briefly discussed issues related to the interpretation of present and future experiments , in particular the question of the relevance of the rate exponential prefactor for the rate asymmetry and the feasibility of achieving the nonlinear regime .",
    "there are plenty of unsolved problems and open issues within this field of research . starting with those more particular and technical",
    ", it would be rewarding to fully clarify the status of concurrent theories , in particular that by grabert which performs amazingly well for intermediate range of @xmath54 s while it seems to fail for large values of @xmath54 .",
    "although the discrepancy is not too large , grabert s theory is supposed to work in that regime as well and , thus , the discrepancy raises serious questions about its very foundation . on the other hand",
    ", it would be very helpful to further develop and fully stabilize ( if possible ) my numerical scheme used for the solution of the bvp .",
    "if this attempt were successful the numerical code could be used for interpreting future experiments routinely since it is very fast and efficient as long as it converges which unfortunately occasionally does nt happen . on a more general level",
    ", it should be further studied what is the effect of nominally subleading terms in the rate on the rate asymmetry .",
    "it appears that the conventional arguments for the dominance of the exponential part of the rate may not be applicable to the rate asymmetry , especially in the linear regime . and",
    "last but not least , a most important question whether one can actually use underdamped josephson junctions for the measurement of the whole fcs and not only the third cumulant in the linear regime is still open and waiting for final answer which , if affirmative , could bring the field of the fcs to new milestones .",
