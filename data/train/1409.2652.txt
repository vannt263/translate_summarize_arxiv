    "the objective of this paper is to show the existence of solution to special class of thermo - visco - elastic models .",
    "we consider reaction of material body treated by external forces and heat flux through the boundary . in the case of ideal elastic deformations ,",
    "the body should return to its initial state after termination of external forces activity .",
    "however , if deformations are not elastic , i.e. there is a loss of potential energy , we deal with special kind of inelastic deformations .",
    "potential energy lost during the process may be transformed into thermal energy .",
    "we focus on the visco - elastic type of deformations , which for instance may be observed in polymers .",
    "both deformations are coupled in physical phenomena and they may be observed at the same time .",
    "consequently , these two types of deformations appear in the models considered in this paper .",
    "elastic deformation is reversible , whereas visco - elastic one irreversible .    the thermo - visco - elastic system of equations , as a consequence of balance of momentum and balance of energy , cf .",
    "@xcite , see also @xcite , captures displacement , temperature and visco - elastic strain . since these two principles do not take into account the material properties of considered body , we may complement it by adding constitutive relations which complete missing information . the standard technique in the solid body deformation",
    "is to work with two constitutive relations .",
    "first one describes the dependency between stress and strains , i.e. this is an equation for the cauchy stress tensor .",
    "second one is a constitutive equation which is characterized by the evolution of visco - elastic strain tensor .",
    "we assume that the body @xmath0 is an open bounded set with a @xmath1 boundary",
    ". then quasi - static evolution problem is formulated by the following system of equations @xmath2 by the solution of this system we understand finding the displacement of material @xmath3 , the temperature of material @xmath4 and the visco - elastic strain tensor @xmath5 .",
    "we denote by @xmath6 the set of symmetric @xmath7-matrices with real entries and by @xmath8 a subset of @xmath6 which contains traceless matrices .",
    "the function @xmath9 stays for the cauchy stress tensor .",
    "by @xmath10 we mean the identity matrix from @xmath6 , thus @xmath11 is a deviatoric ( traceless ) part of the tensor @xmath12 , i.e. @xmath13 .",
    "additionally , we denote by @xmath14 the deformation tensor associated to @xmath15 , i.e. @xmath16 .    the motivation for current paper is to extend results presented in @xcite , where we proved the existence of solution to norton - hoff model , i.e. the model with growth condition on visco - elastic strain tensor in lebesgue spaces . model with growth condition in the generalized orlicz spaces is a natural extension of norton - hoff model as a next step to make an approximation of prandtl - reuss model .",
    "use of generalized orlicz spaces takes into consideration more rapid growth than in the case of growth condition in lebesgue spaces .",
    "furthermore , choice of generalized orlicz space allow us to consider non - homogeneous materials .",
    "since the @xmath17-function depends on the spatial variable @xmath18 , different regions of @xmath19 may have different growth condition .",
    "consideration of non - homogeneous materials implies that the operator @xmath20 may also depend on the spatial variable @xmath18 . in previous papers ,",
    "see @xcite we considered only homogeneous materials .    studying mechanical problems in orlicz spaces is not an isolated issue . in the case of visco - elastic deformation ,",
    "the problem involving orlicz spaces was considered in @xcite , but only in the case of @xmath17-function independent on spatial variable @xmath18 . in the case of @xmath17-function which depends on the spatial variable @xmath18 some accurate assumptions",
    "must be done .",
    "there are two possible ways to make it .",
    "firstly , we may assume the regularity with respect to @xmath18 , e.g. log - hlder continuity in @xcite , secondly upper and lower growth condition of an @xmath17-function with respect to the last variable can be considered , e.g. see @xcite .",
    "there are no results for thermo - visco - elastic problems without any upper and lower growth condition on @xmath17-function with respect to the last variable .",
    "system of equations is a mathematical simplification of more general model .",
    "we consider the quasi - static evolution with small displacement .",
    "it means that we omit acceleration term in momentum equation as a consequence of long - term character of external forces .",
    "small displacement allows us to use the hooke s law in the definition of cauchy stress tensor @xmath21 .",
    "moreover , the material does not change its volume with the temperature , i.e. there is no thermal expansion of body , thus the cauchy stress tensor does not depend on temperature .",
    "system may be completed by formulating the initial @xmath22 in @xmath19 and boundary conditions @xmath23 on @xmath24 .",
    "we control the shape of @xmath19 and the heat flux through the boundary .",
    "to discuss two other equations and to formulate the statement of this paper , we need to use some definitions which are mentioned below for better readability of the paper .",
    "let us begin with presenting the notion of generalized orlicz spaces .",
    "for more general concept of orlicz space we refer the reader to @xcite .",

    "<S> mechanical deformation is coupled with the temperature and they may influence each other . since constitutive function on evolution of visco - elastic deformation depends on temperature , the visco - elastic properties of material also depend on temperature . </S>",
