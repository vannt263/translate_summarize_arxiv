    "one of the unanswered questions in modern physics is whether the photon has a tiny rest mass or not . from a classical point of view and without the notion of the theory of relativity it is totaly unacceptable to assume that a particle like the photon has a zero rest mass .",
    "such a suggestion would be rejected for the following reasons :    1 .",
    "how come a particle that is carrying energy like any other particles does not have something which the rest of the particles have in common , that is a rest mass .",
    "2 .   from the newtonian mechanical point of view",
    ", zero mass means that a particle will be accelerated to infinite velocity by any force no matter how small it is .",
    "if a particle reaches a certain velocity it must be accelerated from rest to this velocity ; it meaningless to say that a particle has no mass at rest , or , in other words has no existence at rest , and then when this nonexisting entity gain momentum it came to creation . again this may be acceptable from a quantum a mechanical point of view , but not from classical point of view .",
    "even after special relativity there are scientists who thought that the photon may have a very small rest mass . to shed light on this point i will quote from a conversation between feynman and a french professor [ 1 ] .",
    "the professor asked  tell me professor feynman , how sure are you that the photon has no rest mass , ? \" .",
    "feynman answeredwell , it depends on the mass ; evidently if the mass is infinitesimally small , so that it would have no effect whatsoever , i could not disprove its existence , but i would be glad to discuss the possibility that the mass is not certain definite size .",
    "the condition is that after i give you arguments against such mass \" the professor then chose a mass of @xmath0 electron mass , feynman answeredif we agreed that the mass of the photon was related to the frequency as @xmath1 , photons of different wave lengths would travel with different velocities .",
    "then in observing the eclipsing double star , which is sufficiently far away , we would observe the eclipse in blue light and red light at different times .",
    "since nothing like this is observed we can put an upper limit on the mass , which , if we do the numbers , turns out to be of the order of @xmath2 electron mass \" .",
    "the professor asked if it is possible that the photon has a mass of @xmath3 .",
    "feynman answeredif the photon has a small mass equal for all photons , larger fractional differences from the massless behavior are expected as the wave length gets longer . so that from the sharpness of the known reflection of radar pulses , we can put an upper limit to the photon mass which is somewhat better than the eclipsing double star argument .",
    "it is turn out to be smaller than @xmath4 electron mass \" .",
    "after this the professor asked what if the mass @xmath5 electron mass .",
    "feynman answered  from field theory argument the potential should go as @xmath6 .",
    "then the earth has a static magnetic field , which is known to extend out into space for some distance , from the behavior of the cosmic ray of the order of few earth radii . but",
    "this means that the photon mass must be of a size smaller than that corresponding to a decay length of the order of 8000 miles , or some , @xmath7 mass \" .",
    "but what if the mass of the photon is much smaller than that .",
    "in fact l. de broglie noted that a rest mass a photon of order @xmath8 g would be impossible to detect .    here",
    "it must be noted that , if there is really a photon with a rest mass no matter how small it is , then this will impose a change on the basic assumptions of the theory of special relativity because the second postulate stated that the velocity of light is always constant and it is equal to @xmath9 no matter what is the velocity of the source [ 2 ] .",
    "clearly that is not the case for a photon with a rest mass , because the velocity of light will depend on the velocity of the source as well as the light s wave length .",
    "the second postulate only applied to photons with infinity energy since only then the velocity of light will be independent of the velocity of the source and it will be exactly @xmath9 , and practically there is no such photons .      the purpose of this work is to introduce a new scheme under which the relativistic energy momentum relation ( einstein dispersion relation ) can be derived without using lorentz transformations and without putting any limit on the maximum velocity with which particles can propagate , and to investigate the possibility of rest mass photons .",
    "the treatment is based on the assumption that the exchange of momentum between particles is not a continuous process , but it happens in the form of discrete pulses .",
    "the derived dispersion relation is an approximation to einstein dispersion relation ( edr ) ; an approximation that is becoming very high with the increase of energies .",
    "it will be shown that under such an assumption it is possible for particles with nonzero mass to travel at the velocity @xmath9 and faster , which means that it is possible for the photon to have a nonzero rest mass .",
    "it will also be shown that the new understanding will explain the results of the michelson - morley experiment .",
    "the constancy of the velocity of light will be a result and not a postulate like in the case of sr .",
    "however it will be shown that the principal of the constancy of the velocity of light can be violated for low energy photons .",
    "the second section will discuss the basic postulates of the work , the third and fourth will show the steps to find the total energy of a particle and the correction terms to edr as a power series .",
    "section four will show a way to find the correction as functions of momentum .",
    "section five will examine the convergence of the solution , section six will discuss the relation between velocity and momentum and between velocity and energy , and faster than light transition , the last section will be for conclusions .",
    "in this work there are two postulates and one preposition .      particles in nature are interacting through exchanging momentum . we are use to deal with momentum in classical mechanics and in most of the cases of quantum mechanics as a continuous quantity .",
    "the core idea of this work is to deal with linear momentum as a sum of vectors of small values each of which has a universal magnitude denoted by @xmath10 , this make linear momentum in some sense a discrete vector entity .",
    "the first postulate stated that : _ i-",
    "the change of the linear momentum of a body or a particle with time has a minimal vector quantity of @xmath11 , with @xmath10 as a universal constant_. to understand what exactly this postulate means let us consider the change of momentum , say from zero value to a value @xmath12 during a time @xmath13 .",
    "the interval @xmath14 can be divided in to smallest possible subintervals @xmath15 such that in each of them the momentum is changing by the smallest possible value . since according to the first postulate ,",
    "the smallest possible change is @xmath11 , the momentum of a particle can be written as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the change of momentum during @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath19 is the change of momentum during @xmath20 , ... and so forth , and @xmath21 it is assumed here that the particle was initially at rest .",
    "since the discrete nature of linear momentum is so far undetectable experimentally , this suggests that the value of @xmath22 is extremely small .",
    "it is so small that the momentum of the particles seems to be continuous .",
    "the equivalence between energy and mass can be reached without using relativity .",
    "in fact , a work by poincar [ 3 ] had led to such a relation by studying the momentum of radiation .",
    "another work by hasenhrl [ 4],[5 ] can lead to the relation by studying the pressure inside a system composed of a hollow enclosure filled with radiation .",
    "braunbeck [ 6 ] had shown in 1937 that the verification of the mass energy equivalence relation by experiment must not be regarded as a theorem that can be derived from other principles of less direct and less empirical evidence , but should be taken as a fundamental principle .",
    "this point of view will be adopted here .",
    "the mass energy relation in this work is a postulate ( or a principle ) , but i stress here that in the mass energy relation .",
    "@xmath23 , the constant @xmath9 will not be defined as the velocity of light , it will be considered only as a constant that has the units of velocity",
    ". it will be one of the results of this work that particles with @xmath24 will travel with a velocity approaching @xmath9 .",
    "the second postulate is : _ mass and energy are equivalent . _",
    "the third postulate is supposed to specify the relation between the energy change of a particle due to a vector change of one momentum pulse @xmath25 and the momentum vector @xmath12 . by knowing this relation , the dispersion relation can be found after summing the values of energies due to a change of momentum by @xmath26-pulses .    to show how this phenomenological relation has been suggested ,",
    "consider a particle that has a change of linear momentum equal to @xmath11 . according to newton s mechanics",
    "the change of energy due to this change of momentum will be @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the initial momentum vector of the particle , or it is the momentum vector before the change of momentum by @xmath11 , and @xmath29 is the rest mass of the particle .",
    "in this work it will be purposed that newton relation is applicable but with a difference , according to the second postulate mass and energy are equivalent therefore the kinetic mass must be used instead of the rest mass .",
    "more about the preposition will be discussed in another work under preparation [ 7 ] . accordingly",
    "the change of the energy of a particle due to a change of its momentum @xmath30 by one momentum pulse is @xmath31 @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the total energy of the particle .",
    "relation ( 5 ) will be used for calculating the energy that is gained by the particle due to the @xmath34 momentum pulse .    according to the previous discussion the state of the proposition will be : _ if a particle with momentum @xmath35 changed its momentum by one momentum pulse then the change of energy due to that will be according to relation(5)_.    in this work",
    "only an accelerated particle from rest will be studied , it will be assumed that the acceleration process will not cause any change in the inner state of particle , and therefore the rest mass will not change .",
    "if a force acting on a particle has fixed direction , then it would be reasonable to believe that all the momentum pulses will be pointing in the same direction of the accelerating force .",
    "accordingly , for all momentum pulses , @xmath36 in relation ( 5 ) . the total linear momentum of the particle after the end of the action of the accelerating force will be : @xmath37 , and therefore the energy change due to the @xmath34 momentum pulse can be written in the following form @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the total energy of the particle due to @xmath26 momentum pulses , or @xmath40 here it must be noted that quantities like @xmath10 , @xmath29 , @xmath33 ... etc .",
    "are measured relative to one fixed observer .",
    "the total kinetic energy @xmath41 of a particle can be calculated by adding the kinetic energy gained from the first pulse plus the energy gained from the second pulse ... and so forth .",
    "therefore @xmath41 can be expressed as @xmath42 , where the delta was dropped from @xmath43 for short hand .",
    "expressing @xmath44 will become more problematic with the increasing of @xmath45 .",
    "this can be shown by calculating @xmath46 and @xmath47 for a particle with rest mass @xmath29 , for example , ( 8) will give @xmath48 the negative energy change solution will lead to a jump of the total energy to negative value due to a small change in momentum equal to @xmath10 . the aspect of such solution will not be discussed in this work .",
    "here it is important to note that the positive solution of ( 11 ) is deviating clearly from the sr solution , but this will not contradict the experiment since there is no measurement to energies of particles with low value of momentum such as one or a few @xmath10 . on the other hand , it will be shown that @xmath33 will approach the one of sr as the momentum increases .",
    "the expression of @xmath47 will be found by using the expression of @xmath46 , because @xmath49 .",
    "therefore ( 8) and ( 11 ) give @xmath50\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is clear that calculating @xmath41 in this way will be unpractical .",
    "the fact that @xmath10 is very small will help in finding a series solution so that the expression of @xmath46 , @xmath47, ... ,@xmath51 can be written as a power series in @xmath10 .",
    "for example , @xmath46 can be expanded as @xmath52 , and the expansion of @xmath47 will be @xmath53 the kinetic energy for this case , where @xmath54 , is @xmath55 for large @xmath26 this will also be an unpractical way of calculation . a rule must be found for the coefficients of the power series for @xmath41 for arbitrary values of @xmath26 . to reach to this rule @xmath41 will be written as @xmath56 so the next step is to find @xmath57 which represents the coefficients of the expansion of @xmath41 for arbitrary @xmath26 . to do",

    "equation ( 27 ) gives @xmath84    to see what these calculation may lead to , a digression would be useful at this point .",

    "it increases further with the decrease of @xmath29 ( increase of @xmath209 ) until it reaches an upper bound when @xmath216 .",
    "then @xmath217 it is obvious that the value @xmath218 decreases with the increase of @xmath141 , and it will be equal to @xmath9 for @xmath219 , which means that the value that a particle can exceed the velocity of light is getting smaller and smaller with the increase of @xmath141 .",
    "therefore the faster than light transition will be discernable only at very low values of @xmath141 , and when the particles involved have very small masses .",
    "for the first case the mass must be smaller than @xmath220 for the second case it must be smaller than @xmath221 and for the third case it must be smaller than @xmath222 .",
    "this work has proved that it is possible to get the einstein dispersion relation without using lorenz transformations .",
    "the edr appears as a zeroth approximation .",
    "the plot of the functions @xmath223 against @xmath170 shows that @xmath224 , and @xmath225 while @xmath226 for @xmath227 .",
    "this means that the edr will be more and more accurate with the increase of momentum .",
    "the derived dispersion relation agrees with the one of sr for high energies .",
    "but for low energies and masses this will not be the case because these terms may have a considerable value",
    ". one of the difficulties here is the unknown value of the universal constant @xmath10 .",
    "because of that it is not possible to predict at what low energies the corrections are needed .",
    "the first assumption of sr that the velocity of light is independent of the velocity of the source is a result here that could be concluded .",
    "this new understanding lead to an experimental conditions in which the first assumption of sr can be violated .",
    "the violation can occur when the wave length of the photons is very long and the source is moving away from the observer with very high velocity .",
    "another important result is it that is permissible for nonzero mass particles to travel with a velocity of @xmath9 and faster .",
    "this will solve the conceptual difficulty of zero mass photon since it is permitted to all particles to have a rest mass here including photons .",
    "the faster than light transition is permitted here only under a condition that the masses of the particles must have a certain degree of smallness compared to @xmath228 .",
    "if there are no such particles in nature ( including photons ) then there will be no ftl .",
    "on the other hand , if ftl is detected then it is the proof of an existence of such particles with such small rest masses .",
    "the results of the previous section show that the there will be no hope of detecting such transition for photons with short wave length ( high momentum ) because from ( 77 ) such a photon will travel with velocity very close to @xmath9 , the ftl could be detected if the experiment is designed to measure the velocity of photons with extremely long wave length .",
    "it has been shown that the largest possible velocity of a particle is @xmath229 that is when @xmath230 and the mass approaches zero .    here",
    "i must admit that there is no usefulness of the new approach in applied physics unless faster than light transition is detected and measured experimentally , it would be hard to justify the replacement of one postulate of sr with three postulate if flt will not be detected .",
