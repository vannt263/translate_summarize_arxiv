    "the _ swift _ gamma - ray burst explorer mission @xcite has vastly increased the number of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) for which x - ray and optical counterparts have been detected .",
    "this has led to a much larger sample of bursts for which a redshift is known or inferred . for the first 409 bursts that triggered",
    "_ swift _ , 135 have a published redshift , compared to 42 redshifts before the advent of _ swift _ @xcite",
    ". this data set has allowed for the first time the use of grbs as cosmological probes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "once redshifts were known for a significant number of bursts , several authors derived relationships between various measured quantities of the prompt emission ",
    "most of these relationships involved relating the time - averaged @xmath3  spectral peak energy ( @xmath0 ) of the prompt emission to bolometric properties of the explosion .",
    "testing such relationships for _ swift _ bursts using _ swift _ data alone is problematic because the narrow bandpass of the burst alert telescope ( bat ) ( 15 - 150 kev for a strong modulated response ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is below @xmath0  for the majority of grbs .",
    "our results show that three quarters of _ swift _ bursts have @xmath4  kev . however , when the _ swift _ data are combined with data from another instrument with a higher energy response , such as the wide - band all - sky monitor ( wam ) on _ suzaku _",
    "@xcite , it is possible to accurately determine @xmath0  for all bursts which are bright enough for their spectra to be reasonably fitted .    due to the large fields of view of the burst alert telescope ( bat ) on _ swift _ @xcite and the wam on _ suzaku _ , it is not uncommon that grbs will be observed by both instruments . between august 2005 ( the start of the _ suzaku _ mission ) and april 2009 , 48 bursts triggered both instruments .",
    "of these bursts 22 have redshifts .",
    "there are an additional 48 bursts untriggered in wam ( and 2 untriggered in bat ) , 14 of which have redshifts . after rejecting 7 bursts which could not be fitted",
    ", we were able to fit the spectra of 91 bursts .",
    "of this set , 24 bursts were best fitted by a simple power law model ( see below for details on the models used ) , thus we have 67 bursts ( 29 with redshifts ) for which @xmath0   can be determined  about 1.5 per month and 18% of all _ swift _ triggers ( 24% of triggers with redshifts ) during the period of overlap between _ suzaku _ and _ swift_. this compares to 8 _ swift _ bursts in the sample reported by ( * ? ? ? *",
    "hereafter known as a06 ) .",
    "the burst sample includes 6 bursts which were determined by the _",
    "swift_/bat team to be short bursts .",
    "all of the short bursts triggered both instruments , have known redshifts and are fitted by a model for which @xmath0   can be determined .",
    "the first paper in which an energy - fluence relationship was derived using accurately determined burst redshifts was that of @xcite . in this paper",
    "the authors analyzed twelve grbs detected by bepposax and derived a linear relationship between @xmath5  and @xmath6 , where @xmath2  is the total bolometric energy ( 1 - 10,000 kev ) of the burst .",
    "a06 extended and revised this work using a larger sample of 41 bursts , but found that short grbs and the subenergetic event grb 980425/sn1998bw do not fit the main relation .",
    "a number of authors have compared _ swift _ bursts to these pre-_swift _ relations . @xcite all show that there is no significant difference between _ swift _ and pre-_swift _ bursts in terms of @xmath0  relations , although @xcite caution that spectral analysis threshold effects could influence the correlation for _ swift _ bursts .",
    "@xcite found that a tighter correlation could be derived if one corrected the total burst energy for collimation using the jet opening angle , which was in turn derived from the panchromatic break time in the afterglow light curve using a geometric relationship @xcite .",
    "this is known as the @xmath0-@xmath7  relation .",
    "it has been difficult to study @xmath0-@xmath7  relations for _ swift _ because _ swift _ bursts show more complicated afterglow light curves than had been observed before and a smaller fraction of bursts show clear late - time jet breaks @xcite .",
    "however @xcite found that the relationship derived by @xcite ( @xmath0-@xmath7 ) holds for the small sample of _ swift _ bursts for which a jet break time was derivable .",
    "however , @xcite point out that the presence of significant outliers weakens the case for an @xmath0-@xmath7  relationship .",
    "since the sample of _ swift - suzaku _ bursts with confirmed jet breaks is so small , we do not attempt here to comment on @xmath0-@xmath7  relations .",
    "a somewhat different relationship is derived by @xcite showing a linear correlation between @xmath5  and the log of the luminosity during the peak second of the burst .",
    "this relationship has been refined by adding the high - signal grb time duration @xcite or a luminosity time @xcite .",
    "all of the relations discussed above have been criticized by various authors . in particular ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite show that the majority of batse bursts are inconsistent with both the @xmath0-@xmath2  and @xmath0-@xmath7  relations , and @xcite argue that the relations are mostly due to selection effects .",
    "we show in this paper that the @xmath0-@xmath2  relation does hold for long _ swift _ bursts , and that the relation can not result simply from selection effects .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in  [ methodology ] we discuss methodology and data selection and describe the spectral models used . then in  [ results ] we describe the distributions of spectral fit parameters . in  [ analysis ] we cover the correlations between burst parameters and compare these results to previously published results .",
    "finally , in  [ discussion ] we provide general conclusions and interpretation .",
    "all of the bursts used in this study triggered either the burst alert telescope ( bat ) on _ swift _ or the wide - band all - sky monitor ( wam ) on _ suzaku _ , and in nearly half the cases triggered both instruments .",
    "the spectra were fitted jointly to the bat and wam data and fits include the time - integrated spectra and sets of time resolved intervals as described below .",
    "either one or two of the four wam detectors were used in the fits , depending on which of the side detectors were hit . for all but one of the bat bursts , event data were used to derive first a light curve in the 15 - 200 kev band . from this light curve",
    "we used the standard _",
    "swift_/bat tool battblocks to determine the total time interval of the burst in the bat energy range , @xmath8 , and those subsidiary peaks of the prompt emission which were found by the tool to be statistically significant .",
    "the battblocks tool uses the bayesian block method of @xcite to determine significant time intervals in a light curve based on bayesian analysis .",
    "the initial bayesian blocks are determined from the bat light curves , but we elected to combine blocks so that they represent significant variations in both bat and wam .",
    "the bin edges are then shifted to match the time quantization of the wam spectral data ( see below ) .",
    "the normal _ swift _ response to a grb consists of a spacecraft slew to the burst location commencing usually between 7 and 40 seconds after the trigger and lasting typically between 40 and 80 seconds . for 37 of the bursts in the sample , the prompt emission which was intense enough to be analyzed in both bat and wam lasted into the spacecraft slew and for 24 of these bursts ,",
    "the prompt emission continued after the termination of the slew . since the location of the burst in the bat field of view ( fov ) changes during the slew",
    ", care must be taken when deriving the instrument response for bursts containing slews ( see below ) .",
    "for this reason , we have also divided burst intervals into , as appropriate , pre - slew , slew and post - slew periods and when bayesian block edges fall within a few seconds of the start or end of a slew , we have shifted the bin edges to match these physical transitions .    for each significant time interval",
    ", we used the tool batbinevt to derive a bat spectral file and batdrmgen to derive a response file . when the spacecraft pointing was stable ( pre - slew and post - slew ) we could use a single response file since the burst was at a constant position in the fov . for any intervals overlapping in whole or in part with the slew",
    ", we used a special procedure to average the response so that it correctly accounted for the changing location of the burst in the fov .",
    "this procedure is described in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter known as s08 ) .",
    "sakamoto et al . ( 2009b ; in preparation ) have shown that there is no systematic problem with analyzing the bat spectra data during the slew using a weighted energy response .",
    "tables  [ tab - general ] and  [ tab - resolved ] indicate clearly which bursts and burst intervals are so affected .",
    "the temporal boundaries of the selected _",
    "swift_/bat intervals had to be further adjusted to match the wam data .",
    "the wam spectral data have a time quantization of 0.5 seconds for bst data covering the period from 8.0 seconds before to 56.0 seconds after a burst trigger , and 1.0 seconds for the trn data outside these intervals and for untriggered bursts .",
    "thus the boundaries of the time intervals must be adjusted to match the wam time quantization .",
    "times were also corrected for time - of - flight differences between the two spacecraft , but because both are in low - earth orbit , this correction is typically only a few milliseconds .",
    "the wam data were inspected for each of the bat - derived time intervals and when wam emission was intense enough for a spectrum to be derived , a wam spectral file was produced . in a number of cases it was necessary to combine multiple bat time intervals into a single interval in order to get enough wam counts for fitting . since _",
    "suzaku _ only rarely slews during bursts , a single response file for each wam detector is used for a given burst . in several cases , even though two wam detectors were hit , we decided to use only one wam detector for analysis , either because the incident angle was bad ( passing through too much passive material ) or because the count rate was too low in one of the detectors to allow a proper spectrum to be accumulated .",
    "such cases are noted in table  [ tab - general ] .",
    "_ suzaku _ wam data analysis was performed using the standard ftools in the headas version 6.6 package . in accordance with _",
    "swift_/bat time intervals , the spectra were accumulated and deadtime corrected . the wam instrumental background is significantly variable with time , so we fitted the wam light curve for each channel before and after the time intervals with a @xmath9  order polynominal function , then interpolated the best - fit model into the source extracted regions .",
    "the energy response was calculated based on incident angles using the response generator , wamrespgen v. 1.9 .",
    "the energy range was limited to be above 120  kev in the fitting .",
    "uncertainties of the flux using the current response is estimated at about 30% above 120 kev @xcite .    for each time interval",
    ", joint fits were made to the bat and wam data .",

    "the fits for each interval and each model were inspected and a time interval / model was rejected if either ( a ) the lower - energy power - law index , @xmath18 , was not constrained , ( b ) the reduced chi - squared , @xmath24 or ( c ) the wam constant @xmath19  was not consistent with unity ( with a few exceptions listed below ) . for the cpl and band models we added the criteria that ( d ) @xmath0 be constrained .",
    "we did not require the higher energy index @xmath20  to be constrained .",
    "if the original  total \" time interval did not yield an acceptable fit , then a shorter time interval which was better matched to the extent of the wam emission was chosen for the time - integrated interval .",
    "such cases are clearly noted in table  [ tab - general ] . in the subsequent discussion the term  total burst interval \" will designate the longest continuous time interval over which an acceptable model fit can be made to either the cpl or band model . in a companion work ,",
    "sakamoto et al . ( 2009b ; in preparation ) , the cross - correlation between bat and wam ( and also konus-_wind _ ) is studied in detail .",
    "they find that the normalizations between the instruments are consistent to within 20% .",
    "a detailed study of grb  050904 has also been carried out @xcite and the results are consistent with this work .    for each time interval ( time - integrated and time - resolved ) ,",
    "the `` best '' spectral model was determined .",
    "the default for each case was a simple power law model . if , however , the difference in @xmath25  between the pl fit and the cpl fit or between the cpl fit and the band fit was @xmath26 , where @xmath27  or @xmath28 , then the more complicated model was deemed to be the `` best '' model",
    "of course this more complicated model fit also had to meet the acceptability criteria listed in the preceding paragraph . with this selection method , for the full burst intervals",

    "however , for all of the bursts for which the cpl model was the best fit , the band model was also an acceptable fit . in each case",
    "the values of @xmath0  for the two models were identical to within statistics .    in all cases in which either the cpl or the band model is the best fit and for which a redshift is known ,",
    "we then transformed @xmath0  to the source frame by multiplying @xmath32  by a factor @xmath33 .",
    "the next step was to determine , for each burst , the isotropic energy , @xmath2 , integrated over the total burst interval and over each time - resolved burst interval . to make sure that we were comparing equivalent quantities for each burst",
    ", we used only the band model to calculate the integrated flux , including those cases for which the band model gives an acceptable fit , but is not the  best \" fit model .",
    "this choice is justified in  [ bias ] .",
    "we also include in our sample bursts for which the high energy power - law index @xmath20  is not constrained , allowing the uncertainty in this parameter to contribute to the overall error in the flux .",
    "to find @xmath2 , we used the definition of @xcite to derive @xmath2 from the integrated flux : @xmath34 $ ] . to allow direct comparison we used the same cosmological parameters as the earlier authors : @xmath35  = 65 km / s , @xmath36  = 0.3 and @xmath37  = 0.7 .",
    "it is also important to check the results for overall quality of fits . in figure",
    "[ chisq - fig ] we show two plots which verify the overall validity of our results . in figure  [ chisq - fig]a , we show the distribution of reduced @xmath25  for the time integrated and time resolved fits .",
    "we see that both histograms peak at @xmath38  with an appropriate distribution of values . in figure",
    "[ chisq - fig]b we show a histogram of the wam normalization factor for those bursts and sequences which otherwise meet the quality standards outlined above .",
    "we see that the distribution has a peak at unity as expected , but also a tail at high values of the normalization constant .",
    "two of the tail points in the time integrated histogram at just above 4.0 are due to grb  060124 , which is a unique burst in the sample in that bat triggered on a precursor @xmath39  seconds before the main emission and the wam trigger .",
    "the bat event data extended to only @xmath40  s , where @xmath41  here and henceforth refers to the _ swift_/bat trigger time .",
    "therefore , we used bat survey data with a time resolution of 250 seconds instead of the usual @xmath42  resolution .",
    "the wam data covered only the 33 seconds of actual emission .",
    "this difference in data duration is responsible for an increased wam normalization factor .",
    "since the energy resolution for survey data is as good as for event data and the analysis looks robust , we include the burst in our sample .",
    "the other high tail point is due to grb  080218a , which has a very low @xmath43  kev , and for which @xmath0  is fitted well with the bat data alone .",
    "inclusion of the wam data does not significantly affect the result , so given the high normalization factor , we have decided to report the result of the bat fit for this burst .",
    "tail points for individual sequences were from weak sequences and were excluded from the data tables and plots .",
    "the results of this analysis for individual bursts are given in four tables .",
    "table  [ tab - general ] gives a list of all jointly detected bursts and includes bat and wam trigger numbers , the wam detector sides used in the analysis , the burst redshift when available , bat @xmath44 , and the temporal extent of each total burst interval . in tables",
    "[ tab - integrated ]  [ tab - fluence ] , the fit parameters for the total burst intervals are given .",
    "bursts for which either the cpl or band models are acceptable fits are listed in table  [ tab - integrated ] , while those bursts for which only a pl model is acceptable are listed separately in table  [ tab - powerlaw ] .",
    "table  [ tab - fluence ] lists the fluence values from a band model fit for each burst in table  [ tab - integrated ] . in table",
    "[ tab - resolved ] we list the fit parameters for each time - resolved burst segment for which we could find an acceptable fit to either the cpl or band model .",
    "we do not include burst segments for which only a simple pl is an acceptable fit .",
    "histograms of the fit parameters for the time integrated and time resolved spectra are shown in the following figures : the low - energy power - law index @xmath18  in figure  [ alpha - fig2 ] , the high - energy power - law index @xmath20  in figure  [ beta - fig1 ] , and @xmath0  in figure  [ epeak - fig2 ] . for a given parameter",
    "a pair of plots ( time - integrated and time - resolved ) is given for each model that contains that parameter .",
    "in other words , the @xmath18  parameter is plotted for all three models , the @xmath20  parameter only for the band model , and the @xmath0  parameter for the cpl and band models .",
    "the dashed histograms in figure  [ alpha - fig2]a , b are created by assigning each burst to a histogram based on which model is the best fit for that burst ( see column  9 in table  [ tab - integrated ] ) .",
    "the solid black histograms are the accumulations of the dashed line histograms . in figures",
    "[ alpha - fig2]c , [ beta - fig1]a and [ epeak - fig2]c , we also show for the time integrated spectra the histograms of the parameter distributions for short bursts in blue or light gray . the median values and the dispersions ( quartile ) for each histogram",
    "are given in table  [ tab - histograms ] .",
    "we also show a pair of scatter plots in figure  [ scatter - fig1 ] .",
    "we plot @xmath18  with respect to fluence in the 15 - 150 kev band and with respect to @xmath0 .",
    "these plots are discussed in the text below .",
    "we see in figure  [ alpha - fig2]a that the harder the burst ( less negative @xmath18 ) the more likely we are to be able to fit a model with a larger number of parameters .",
    "this bias is also seen for the time resolved spectra in figure  [ alpha - fig2]b .",
    "furthermore , in examining figures  [ alpha - fig2]c , [ beta - fig1 ] and  [ epeak - fig2]c and the relevant individual histograms , one can see few differences in the distributions of @xmath18 , @xmath20 , and @xmath0  between time integrated and time resolved fits .",
    "one can see in figure  [ alpha - fig2]c that the median @xmath18  for the time resolved spectra is softer than that for the time integrated spectra .",
    "the time resolved spectra are more likely to be from later and hence softer segments of the bursts .",
    "although there are far fewer short bursts than long bursts , one can see some differences between spectral fit parameters for these two classes of bursts . in figure  [ alpha - fig2]c",
    ", we note that although the distributions overlap , short bursts are clustered toward the hard side of the @xmath18  distribution , with a median value , -0.72 , different from the overall median , -1.23 .",
    "figure  [ epeak - fig2]c gives a similar picture ",
    "one can not distinguish short from long bursts by their @xmath0  values , but short bursts are much more likely to have a high value of @xmath0  than are long bursts .",
    "first we examine the bursts for which the pl model is the best fit .",
    "one can see clearly in figure  [ scatter - fig1]a ( black points ) , that these are not intrinsically faint bursts , even though we are likely `` losing '' a significant fraction of the flux below 15  kev .",
    "however , due to their soft spectra ( low @xmath18 values ) , these bursts tend to be very weak in the wam band and/or have an @xmath0 value below the wam energy threshold and a weak `` lever arm '' in the bat energy range , so that it is not possible to fit a spectral break using the joint bat / wam data .",
    "the basic conclusion of this is that if the low - energy index @xmath45 , it is very difficult to constrain @xmath0 with the bat - wam data unless the burst is particularly bright ( @xmath46 ) . as the work of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter known as s09 ) shows , bursts in this range tend to have low values of @xmath47  kev .",
    "figure  [ scatter - fig1]a shows that there is no apparent correlation between burst fluence and the form of the most acceptable spectral model .    the results of s09 allow us to verify that @xmath0 for the pl - only bursts is indeed likely to be within the bat energy range , but below the wam energy range . in table  [ tab - powerlaw ] we include estimates of @xmath0  derived from the formulas given in s09 which relate @xmath0  to the power - law index derived from a power - law model fit , @xmath18  ( called @xmath48 in s09 ) .",
    "two of the bursts ( grbs 060211a and 060322 ) were bright enough to be fitted with the bat data and we have used @xmath0  from s08 .",
    "another two bursts have @xmath18  outside the range for which the s09 formulas are considered valid and we report no @xmath0  values .",
    "for 19 of the 22 bursts with @xmath0  values we see that our best fit estimates of @xmath0  are within the bat energy range , but below the wam energy range .",
    "all of the remaining three have @xmath0  values at the lower end of the wam range and pl indices near the lower edge of the validity of the s09 relation , so @xmath0  values derived from s09 may be in question .",
    "grb  080303 and grb  090305 are weak bursts which were not triggered in wam .",
    "the other , grb  080123 , did trigger wam , but we were unable to constrain @xmath0  with either the bat - wam data or the bat only data .",
    "however , with a few possible exceptions , all pl - only bursts in our sample have estimated @xmath0  values in the bat energy range which puts them at the low end of the bat - wam energy range .    in conclusion , for this set of bursts we are fitting mostly to the part of the band spectrum above the break energy . therefore what we derive as @xmath18  in a pl fit is actually @xmath20  in the intrinsic spectrum , hardened somewhat by an inclusion of part of the spectrum above the break .",
    "this explains why the pl index values are so soft : @xmath49 , which is intermediate between @xmath18  and @xmath20  measured for grbs fit with the band function .",
    "next we examine those bursts for which the cpl model is the best fit . in those cases for which @xmath0  is determined , one can see an interesting trend in figures  [ epeak - fig2]a and  [ scatter - fig1]b .",
    "bursts for which the band model is statistically favored tend to have a hard @xmath50 , but a _ low _",
    "@xmath51  kev ( dashed histogram in figure  [ epeak - fig2]a and blue points in figure  [ scatter - fig1]b . ) . beyond this set",
    ", we find a large sample of bursts ( solid histogram in figure  [ epeak - fig2]a ) for which the band model is an acceptable fit , but not statistically favored over the cpl model .",
    "for these bursts , one finds a much broader distribution of @xmath0  values with a higher average @xmath52  kev .",
    "what this tells us is that for most bursts with a moderate @xmath53  kev , _ both _ the band and cpl models produce acceptable fits , but only for those bursts with particularly low @xmath0 , is there sufficient flux above the spectral break that the band model is favored by more than @xmath54 .",
    "we can see from the fourth column of table  [ tab - histograms ] that most of the bursts which are `` band - acceptable / cpl - favored '' ( _ bacf _ ) have a distribution of the high energy band parameter @xmath20  quite similar to the `` band - best '' bursts .",
    "for these bursts , we are fitting mostly to the part of the band spectrum below the break energy , where a cut - off power law dominates .",
    "an inclusion of part of the spectrum above the break softens the apparent @xmath18 .",
    "some of the bursts in the _ bacf _ set do have @xmath20  values outside the main distribution ( @xmath55 ) , suggesting that we are only deriving an upper limit for @xmath20  values for these bursts .",
    "even with the extended energy range of bat and wam , we have a minority of bursts for which the band model is unambiguously the best fit .",
    "earlier studies of burst spectra have shown that the form of the fit model which yields the lowest @xmath25  depends where @xmath0  falls with respect to the high and low energy bounds of the detector .",
    "in particular @xcite show through simulations that even when the band model is the intrinsic spectrum of a burst , increasing the lower energy bound in the fit biases fits toward simpler models . they also show that on average fits to bursts with low signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratios yield the correct fit parameters , but that the dispersion in the fit parameters increases with decreasing s / n . later work by s09 shows that it is difficult to fit bursts with low @xmath0  with a cpl or band model because there is not sufficient data on _ both _ sides of @xmath0  to adequately constrain a model with a break . in short , the results of @xcite and s09",
    "tell us that while all bursts are probably representable by the band model , simpler models are often found to be acceptable or even statistically favored .",
    "the distribution of fit parameters and the nature of the best fit models found in our work is consistent with these conclusions .",
    "in  [ methodology ] we noted that we will use parameters derived from the band model for the correlations to be examined in  [ analysis ] .",
    "thus it is important to verify that the @xmath0  values derived from the band fit for the _ bacf _ bursts are acceptable to use .",
    "we conclude that this is the case for several reasons .",
    "first of all , as discussed above , spectral studies and simulations show that the band model is likely to be able to represent all long grb spectra .",
    "secondly , all bursts for which a cpl model was the best fit could also be acceptably fitted with a band model .",
    "thirdly , in figure  [ epeak - fig2]a , we see that the distribution of @xmath0  values derived from the cpl model and the band model are nearly identical and have median values that agree to within error ( see table  [ tab - histograms ] ) .",
    "finally we find in figure  [ epeak - epeak ] that the correspondence between the two @xmath0  values ( cpl and band ) is good .",
    "we do see a clear trend for the cpl model to find a higher @xmath0  than the band model for a given burst .",
    "this makes sense if we assume that the band model represents the intrinsic spectrum : fitting such a spectrum to a model without a separate high energy component requires a higher cut - off energy to adequately fit the high energy data .",
    "this is to be expected based on an examination of the functional forms of the two models ( equations 2 and 3 ) we see that the models are the same for @xmath56 , differing only in their behavior when @xmath57 . and",

    "two things are apparent .",
    "first , there is a relative dearth of bursts in this sample at the lower left of figure  [ amati_fig_zoom ] ( weak , low @xmath0  bursts ) .",
    "we attribute this to not being able to fit bat - wam bursts with @xmath47  kev , as discussed in  [ plfits ] .",
    "secondly , we see an excess of bursts above and to the left of the main distribution ( weak , high @xmath0  bursts ) .",
    "this is significant and is discussed further in  [ other - corr ] .    as other authors have , we find that the data are best fitted by a power - law relation , @xmath94 .",
    "following the discussion in a06 , we find that @xmath25  is reduced if we include an additional parameter @xmath95  in the fit to account for intrinsic scatter in the data , beyond what can be accounted by simple statistical error bars .",
    "the log - likelihood density function @xmath96  that we maximized is identical to the equation 5 in @xcite , with our parameter @xmath97  replacing @xmath98  in @xcite . in this function",
    ", there is a dependence on the parameter @xmath95   in the normalization of the log - likelihood distribution , so we can not simply interpret @xmath99 . if we examine the original likelihood function ( equation 52 and discussion following in @xcite ) , we see that the exponential part of the likelihood corresponds to the normal @xmath25  which is multiplied by a normalization . therefore , to provide a comparison between the goodnesses of fit for different samples , we quote @xmath100  in the last column of  [ tab - results ] as the minimization of the exponential part of the likelihood function divided by the number of degrees of freedom in the fit .",
    "the current sample shows a clear correlation between @xmath0  and @xmath2  for long grbs .",
    "the points ( accounting for sample variance ) are best fitted by the line @xmath101 , where @xmath0  is in units of kev , and @xmath2  units of @xmath102  erg .",
    "this shows that even with a slightly different ( higher @xmath0 ) distribution , the @xmath59  relation still holds .",
    "the results from fits to various parts of this data set are given in table  [ tab - results ] .",
    "in the first eight rows , we fitted various data sets shown in figure  [ amati_fig_zoom ] to the power - law relation @xmath94 .",
    "the first line gives our fit to the original grb sample of a06 ( excluding x - ray flashes ) .",
    "we derive a slope @xmath103 , intercept @xmath97  and sample variance @xmath95 consistent with a06 .",
    "the next three lines are fits to burst samples previous to this work .",
    "we see that there is a significant difference between the fits to the 6 _ swift _ bursts in the a06 sample and the 33 non-_swift _ bursts , with the slope of the fit to the _ swift _ bursts being much higher ( 0.74 _ vs. _ 0.43 ) and the intercept being much lower ( 55 _ vs. _ 111 ) .",
    "although the correlation is good ( @xmath104 ) and @xmath100  very close to one , the small sample of a06 _ swift _ bursts may be an anomaly .",
    "the comparison between the current sample and the earlier sample of _ swift bursts _",
    "( lines 4 and 5 in table  [ tab - results ] ) is quite close .",
    "the intercepts are consistent to within error , although the sample variance @xmath95  is a good deal larger for the current sample .",
    "neither case shows a great deal of correlation ( @xmath105 ) .    in comparison to earlier @xmath0  relationships ,",
    "our sample has a higher range of @xmath0  values and a significantly broader dispersion ( as evidenced by the larger sample variance @xmath95 ) than does the a06 sample .",
    "nonetheless , we are able to derive a reasonable correlation between @xmath0  and @xmath2  with a slope that matches that of a06 ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "similarly we can show good correlations between @xmath0  and @xmath2  for both ( a ) _ swift _ long bursts and ( b ) all long bursts despite the sample variances , and can fit slopes to the relationship ( @xmath107   and @xmath108 ) that are consistent with earlier findings .",
    "it is important to note that the slope of the relationship is consistent even though the @xmath0  range ( reflected in the @xmath97  intercept parameter ) is significantly higher for the _ swift _ sample ( @xmath109 ) than for the pre-_swift _ sample studied by a06 ( @xmath110 ) .",
    "a higher value of @xmath97  means that a burst with a given @xmath0  in the source frame will have , on average , a lower @xmath2 . with @xmath111 , for a given @xmath0 , @xmath2 for a _ swift _ burst would be ( @xmath112  for a pre-_swift _ burst .",
    "however , examination of figure  [ amati_fig ] shows that we are actually sampling roughly the same range of @xmath2  as the pre-_swift _ sample , but with a broader distribution of larger @xmath0  values .",
    "furthermore we confirm that this relationship holds for _ swift _ bursts over @xmath113  orders of magnitude in @xmath2  and nearly @xmath114  orders in @xmath0  and over a redshift range of @xmath115  with no indication of any variation in the relationship with redshift .",
    "this tells us that we are now sampling a different part and a broader section of the burst population than did earlier experiments , but with similar results .",
    "several authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have questioned whether the tightness of the @xmath59  relation is due to instrumental selection effects . on the low side of the relation ,",
    "selection effects can not be important : if an instrument can detect a burst at a given @xmath0  and @xmath2  it could certainly detect a burst at the same @xmath0  but a larger @xmath2 .",
    "thus the absence of bursts in the lower right of figures  [ amati_fig ] and  [ amati_fig_zoom ] must be a real physical effect .",
    "on the upper side of the relation however , it is possible that instrumental effects are causing bursts to be missed .",
    "this possibility arises because _ swift_/bat and _ suzaku_/wam , like other detectors , require a minimum _ photon _ flux to trigger or detect a burst .",
    "swift_/bat trigger is particularly complicated , allowing effective triggers on many different time scales , but essentially a trigger requires a particular count rate above background . the relationship between energy _ fluence _ , the observer - frame analog of @xmath2 , and photon _ flux _ is a complicated one , depending on the spectral and also the temporal properties of the burst ( rapidly varying spiky bursts with high peak count rates are more likely to trigger than slowly varying bursts ) , but the general trend is that hard grbs produce fewer photons than soft grbs of the same total energy fluence .",
    "@xcite has calculated the peak flux threshold for _ swift_/bat as a function of energy for several different burst spectra .",
    "we have attempted to derive such a threshold from the data .",
    "since the _ swift_/bat trigger operates on many different time scales , we consider photon fluence to be a better determinator of threshold than peak flux .",
    "using our fits to the band model for long grbs , we derive for each burst the ratio @xmath116  between photon fluence ( @xmath117 ) and energy fluence ( units @xmath118 ) in the 1 - 10000  kev band .",
    "this ratio is plotted with respect to @xmath0  in figure  [ scatter - fig2]a .",
    "there is a good deal of scatter in the distribution , but the trend is for @xmath116  to be smaller for larger @xmath0 .",
    "we fitted the data and found a weak correlation @xmath119 ( @xmath120  chance probability ) .",
    "the next step is to determine the energy fluence threshold at a representative energy . to be included in this study ,",
    "the burst must trigger the bat and also be bright enough to be detected in the wam .",
    "it is clear from figure  [ scatter - fig1]a in which bursts from s08 are plotted in gray behind the bursts in the current sample , that the wam threshold is higher than the bat threshold .",
    "there is also an effective threshold in @xmath18  since bursts with @xmath121  are soft and unlikely to be fitted with a cpl or band model even if detected in wam .",
    "however , any burst in gray with @xmath122 since the launch of _ suzaku _ could have potentially been detected by _",
    "suzaku_. for such bursts in s08 since 2005",
    "september 1 , we find the following statistics . for the 15 long bursts with @xmath123(15 - 150  kev ) @xmath124  ( flux from s08 ) , none were detected in wam , 7 were not visible to wam ( due to earth occultation or the detector being disabled during passage through the south atlantic anomaly ) , and 8 were visible , but not detected .",
    "of the 51 bursts with @xmath123(15 - 150  kev)@xmath125 , 36 were detected in wam , 13 were not visible to wam , and only 2 were visible but not detected .",
    "this shows that there is a very sharp threshold for wam detection among _ swift _ bursts .    in figure",
    "[ scatter - fig2]b we plot @xmath0  with respect to energy fluence ( 1 - 10000  kev ) .",
    "the lowest fluence of any long burst in the sample is @xmath126  for a burst with @xmath0  = 141  kev .",
    "we take this point to be our detection threshold and then use the best fit to the data of figure  [ scatter - fig2]a to determine an effective energy fluence threshold as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "this is shown as the green dashed line in figure  [ scatter - fig2]b .",
    "we see that this threshold line does a reasonable job of bounding the @xmath0   fluence distribution from above . our empirical energy dependent threshold does not show a flattening above @xmath127  kev as do the plots in @xcite  such a flattening would lead to a steepening of the dashed green line in figure  [ scatter - fig2]b , moving it away from our burst distribution .",
    "we note that several short bursts are detected above this threshold ; since all of the fluence is found within a very short time period , short bursts have very different photon to energy fluence ratios and can be detected at lower energy fluence levels .",
    "the last step is to translate the observer frame threshold to @xmath59  space .",
    "since the transformation depends on redshift , we have indicated the equivalent threshold as green hashed regions in figures  [ amati_fig ] and  [ amati_fig_zoom ] , where the different traces are for different redshift values .",
    "what is seen is that the instrumental selection effect does not cut sharply into the distribution of detected bursts : all bursts save one ( grb  070318 ) are @xmath114  or more times brighter than the threshold .",
    "however the threshold effect would preclude us from seeing bursts more than a factor of 2 fainter than those that are detected .",
    "also bursts near threshold may be rare and may start to be detected with further observations .",
    "thus we conclude that for the current study , detector selection effects are not likely to have a strong influence on the distribution of detected bursts in @xmath59  space ; however the threshold is near enough to the distribution that it may prove important with an expanded data set .",
    "we also examined whether the shift of the @xmath0  ",
    "@xmath2  line toward higher @xmath97  is a redshift effect , since _ swift _ is sampling from a higher redshift distribution than earlier samples @xcite .",
    "such evolution was suggested by @xcite , although @xcite do not confirm the @xcite result .",
    "consistent with @xcite , we do not see any bias with regard to redshift ( see figure  [ redshift_fig ] ) and no sign of evolution of the slope or the intercept of the @xmath0  ",
    "@xmath2  relationship with redshift ( figure  [ redshift_fig_2 ] ) .",
    "we also fitted the entire set of published _ swift _",
    "@xmath0  and @xmath2  values , and find a result consistent with that for our sample , @xmath128 .",
    "the basic result is that when all bursts are taken into account , a clear @xmath0  - @xmath2  relationship still holds , but the scatter in the distribution is wider than has been previously reported .",
    "this makes it particularly difficult to use this relationship to determine pseudo - redshifts , given only the @xmath0  of the burst .",
    "there is one peculiar outlier in the bat / wam long grb sample that is not included in the fit .",
    "this point , red at the upper left of figure  [ amati_fig ] , is grb  060505 ( yamaoka et al . 2009b , in preparation ) .",
    "this subluminous grb triggered wam and passed the first rate trigger stage in the bat , but it was too weak to trigger the bat onboard burst response .",
    "however since the burst duration was only 4  seconds , the 10 seconds of event data ( collected for such",
    " failed `` triggers ) allowed us to derive a bat position and spectrum .",
    "it is possible that this grb is similar to another subluminous event , grb 980425/sn 1998bw , which is located to the far left of figure  [ amati_fig ] at @xmath129 . like grb  980425",
    ", grb  060505 is relatively nearby ( @xmath130 ) , but unlike the earlier burst , no supernova has been found associated with the burst . in order to shift grb  060505 and",
    "grb  980425 to the right on the plot until they reached the red fit line , we need to multiply @xmath2  for each burst by a factor of @xmath131 .",
    "a06 also mention a third possible member of this class , grb  031203 , also nearby ( @xmath132 ) and also inconsistent with the main relationship , although they note that there is particularly large uncertainty in @xmath0  for this burst .",
    "@xcite point out that another nearby ( @xmath133 ) event associated with a supernova , grb  060218 , _ is _ consistent with the @xmath59  relation .",
    "they go on to show that strong spectral evolution in the other outliers may have meant that @xmath0  could have been much lower and @xmath2  somewhat larger than what was measured , meaning that these bursts might not be outliers .",
    "although more such bursts will need to be studied to verify this , it is possible that grbs  060505 and 980425 are examples of a separate class of underluminous grbs with @xmath0 values within the range of ' ' normal \" long bursts , but isotropic energy values three orders of magnitude lower than would be expected from the main @xmath59  relation .",
    "as has been seen by previous authors ( e.g. a06 ) , short grbs do not follow the @xmath59  relation and lie outside the main distribution in the direction of lower @xmath2  for a given @xmath0 .",
    "if we include grb  050709 from a06 , we can make a tentative fit to the short burst distribution , deriving a fit to @xmath134 , but this fit is heavily weighted by this single burst , while all other short bursts are in a broad cluster for which no correlation is found . and",
    "even with grb  050709 we calculate a correlation factor of only @xmath135 .",
    "thus we can not claim that there is any significant @xmath59  relation for short grbs .",
    "another important relation was discovered by @xcite , who found a good correlation between the time - integrated burst @xmath0  and the luminosity in the brightest one second of the burst , @xmath136 .",
    "we do not examine this relationship in the current work , but given its importance , we will investigate it in a later paper .      since we have fits to a great number of individual burst pulses we can compare @xmath0  and @xmath2  for individual burst pulses .",
    "this result is shown in figure  [ amati_seq_fig ] .",
    "the best fit to this sample is @xmath137 , which is shown by the solid red line in figure  [ amati_seq_fig ] . on the whole",
    "this distribution shows a tighter correlation ( and less sample variance ) than does the time - integrated sample ( see table  [ tab - results ] ) , indicating that the @xmath59  relation is intrinsic to burst pulses .",
    "the slope of this fit ( 0.45 ) is consistent with the slope of the fits to the full burst samples , telling us that the full burst @xmath59  relation arises from a superposition of burst pulses , each of which fit the relation .",
    "the offset of this distribution from the time - integrated fit is easily understood .",
    "burst pulses have a distribution of @xmath0  values similar to time integrated @xmath0  values ( see figure  [ epeak - fig2]c and table  [ tab - histograms ] ) , but since the durations of pulses are shorter there is less integrated flux in a pulse . because a total burst is made up of a compilation of pulses , each with its own point on the @xmath59  plot , it is not surprising that the time integrated distribution has a larger intrinsic scatter .",
    "this shows that the total burst @xmath59  relation is a consequence of the relation holding for individual burst pulses . using a different relation ,",
    "@xcite also find that burst pulses follow the same correlations as full bursts .",
    "it is interesting to ask whether there is any time evolution of the @xmath59  relation within bursts . to study this we divided the burst pulses into three bins according to when they occurred within the burst .",
    "the total duration of each burst ( @xmath8 ) was divided into quarters and the mid time of each pulse was placed into one of three time bins according to whether it was in the first quarter of the burst , the second quarter of the burst or the second half of the burst .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ amati_seq_fig2 ] where pulses are colored or shaded according to their time bin .",
    "there is scatter in all distributions , but we can see some differences in the distributions .",
    "the earlier sequences ( red ) have a higher @xmath0  distribution and tend to be clustered in a region of high @xmath2 . as line 10 in table",
    "[ tab - results ] shows , the correlation between @xmath0  and @xmath2  is somewhat poorer for this group .",
    "the fits to all three groups have roughly the same slope and the first two sequences have the same intercept to within error . comparing the 2nd quarter and 2nd half sequences , we see a drop in the line intercept showing that @xmath0  falls ( successive peaks soften ) while @xmath2  covers the same range in the two groups . this result suggests that along with the well - known softening of bursts with time that the @xmath59  relation for burst sequences also evolves with time , with less correlation early in the burst and more later on . as for the time - integrated sample ,",
    "short burst pulses are outliers to the overall relationship .",
    "there are not enough short burst pulses to be able to say whether or not there is any correlation in this sample .    since we see a correlation in the source frame , it is important to ask whether a similar correlation exists in the observer frame . when the redshift is known , transforming @xmath32  to @xmath138  is effected by simply multiplying @xmath32  by @xmath139 .",
    "the transformation from observed flux to isotropic flux is given in ",
    "[ methodology ] .",
    "there is a factor of @xmath139  in the denominator , but since the luminosity distance @xmath140  is directly proportional to redshift , the net effect is that @xmath141 .",
    "thus to first order both @xmath0  and @xmath2  should scale from observer frame quantities by a similar factor of @xmath142 .    therefore in the absence of evolution with redshift we would expect to see a correlation between @xmath32  and measured fluence .",
    "this relationship is plotted in figure  [ scatter - fig2]b for fluence in the 1 - 10000 kev ( extrapolated ) band .",
    "the fluence was calculated by fitting the the data to a band model , allowing the total area under the curve between the low and high energy bounds to be a free parameter .",
    "bursts with and without known redshift are distinguished by color ( red and black points , respectively ) and we see no systematic bias between these two data sets , telling us that bursts with redshifts sample well the total distribution of bursts . since the transformation of the ensemble of non - redshift bursts to the source frame should be same as for redshift - detected bursts , we conclude that almost all of the data points , both with and without redshift can be made consistent with the source frame @xmath59  relationship at some reasonable redshift .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the result found for the batse data sample ( * ? ? ?",
    "* k06 ) in which it was determined that a large fraction of bursts were inconsistent with the relationship in the observer frame .",
    "we can use figure  [ scatter - fig2]b to understand this result and compare it to those of other authors .",
    "the two solid black lines on figure  [ scatter - fig2]b are placed to represent the envelope of points in the @xmath0  fluence plane shown in figure  4 in @xcite . comparing to these lines",
    "( which are approximate ) we see only one outlier in the bottom right ( low @xmath0 , high fluence ) , but a number of outliers in the upper left ( high @xmath0 , low fluence ) , which are , however , below our estimated instrumental threshold .",
    "these outliers correspond to the points above and to the left of the main distribution in figure  [ amati_fig_zoom ] .",
    "this is the region that @xcite and others have discussed as being due to instrumental threshold effects . and",
    "in fact this is a region that is excluded in the arguments of @xcite for _ swift _ alone , because _ swift_/bat alone can not determine @xmath0  in this region .",
    "however , by including an instrument with a much broader energy range , we can extend the threshold into regions that have not been previously explored  not by _ swift _ alone because of its narrow energy range and not by other experiments because of their relatively poorer sensitivity .",
    "the relative sparseness of this region for other instruments is understandable : _ swift _ is more likely to trigger on bursts with higher fluence and lower @xmath0 .",
    "the correlation in the observer frame is not as strong as it is in the source frame .",
    "the correlation coefficient in the source frame is only @xmath143 , compared to @xmath105   in the observer frame .",
    "also the intrinsic scatter in the data is higher , @xmath144   and @xmath145 .",
    "the result that the @xmath0  fluence relationship becomes narrower when transformed into the source frame @xmath59  relationship is consistent with the source frame relationship having a physical basis and not just arising as a reflection of an artificial observer frame relationship .",
    "recently @xcite have developed tests for determining whether selection effects significantly affect apparent grb correlations .",
    "we will study and apply these tests in a later paper .",
    "we present here a complete set of time - integrated and time - resolved spectral fits for the prompt emission for a set of 91 bursts , 35 of which have measured redshifts .",
    "this provides a very useful addition to the _ swift_/bat catalog ( s08 ) , an expansion of previous compilations of bursts for which both @xmath0  and redshift are known ( a06 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and a companion to the _ cgro_/batse ( * ? ? ?",
    "* k06 ) and hete-2 @xcite spectral catalogs .",
    "this work shows the power and utility of joint fits with _ swift_/bat and other instruments with larger energy ranges and we hope that this work will give guidance to future joint fits efforts , such as between _ swift_/bat and _ fermi_/gbm and lat .",
    "it is also important to compare our results with those from these other missions .",
    "we first compare our @xmath0  distribution with that of batse ( k06 ; see figure  [ bat - batse - fig ] ) .",
    "we find that , while our distribution has wider tails , the median values of @xmath0  for batse ( @xmath146  kev ) and bat / wam ( @xmath89  kev ) are the same to within error .",
    "the comparisons of other spectral parameters are similarly within error of each other ( see  [ batse ] ) . as do k06",
    ", we do not see any clustering in the low - energy power law index at any values other than @xmath147 .",
    "we also make a direct comparison between our derived values of @xmath0  and those from the _ wind_/konus experiment ( figure  [ konus_fig ] ) and see that the two sets of values agree to within errors .",
    "we are able to show that an @xmath59  relationship holds for most long grbs the slope of the fit to our data matches that derived by other authors such as a06 , even though we probe a burst distribution with a higher range of @xmath0  values than have previously been studied . with the addition of our bursts , there are now a total of 58 _ swift _ long bursts and 91 total long bursts for which both @xmath0  and redshift are known .",
    "we have now shown that the correlation between @xmath0  and @xmath2  holds for a large sample ( @xmath148 ) bursts observed by six different experiments and that while the region of @xmath59  space explored is different for different experiments , the degree of correlation and the slope of the relationship holds constant .",
    "we are able to confirm that the @xmath59  relation holds not just for entire bursts but for statistically separable sub - intervals ( sequences ) within bursts as well and in fact we find the same slope , @xmath149   for sequences as for whole bursts .",
    "while a full study of possible evolution of the relationships is beyond the scope of this paper we see no sign ( figures  [ redshift_fig ] ; [ redshift_fig_2 ] ) that that the relationships depend on burst redshift .",
    "although we show a clear correlation between @xmath0  and @xmath2 , the large scatter in the distribution makes any use of this relationship to determine a pseudo - redshift problematic .",
    "as has been seen before , short grbs are outliers to the @xmath59  relationship with a large scatter and very poor correlation .",
    "all short bursts lie in the part of the @xmath150  plane at high @xmath0  and relatively low @xmath2 .",
    "this is consistent with the observations that short bursts are sub - luminous with respect to long bursts and a further indication that short bursts form a physically distinct population .",
    "also we see that sub - energetic bursts ( grb  060505 in this sample and grb  980425/sn 1998bw in the a06 sample ) also form a separate population from the long burst population , though it is of course not possible to constrain a correlation with only two data points .",
    "our sample does not contain any x - ray flashes , because such bursts would be too weak in the wam energy range to be detected by wam .",
    "also , too few _ swift _ bursts have solid jet breaks for us to comment on collimation - corrected relationships ( e.g. @xcite ) that involve the jet opening angle .",
    "we find a weak correlation with a great deal of scatter between @xmath0  in the observer frame and observer frame fluence @xmath123 .",
    "the correlation becomes much narrower when working in the source frame which supports but does not prove that the source frame correlation has a physical origin and is not just a reflection of a narrow observer frame correlation .",
    "when we compare bursts with redshifts to bursts without ( figure  [ scatter - fig2]c ) we see that non - redshift bursts are interspersed with redshift bursts , hence all of the bat / wam bursts are in a region of @xmath151  space to be consistent with the @xmath59  relation , further supporting the interpretation that the relationship is real and not an artifact of a selection effect .",
    "the large , homogeneous sample of bursts presented here gives us an unbiased picture of the energetic properties of bursts detected by _",
    "swift_. the addition of spectral information from _",
    "suzaku_/wam allows full fits to be made to nearly all of the bursts , and we show that this sample is consistent spectrally with the much larger set of batse bursts ( k06 ) .",
    "since so many _ swift _ bursts have measured redshifts , we are also able to confirm that one of the most important empirical relationships of grb prompt emission , the correlation between @xmath0  and @xmath2 , holds for our sample .",
    "we have shown the validity and importance of combining _",
    "swift_/bat data with data from another experiment .",
    "since all instruments involved are still functioning , in future years it will be possible to expand the bat - wam catalog , and carry out similar joint fits between _ swift_/bat and _ wind_/konus and _ fermi_/gbm .",
