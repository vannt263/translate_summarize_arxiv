    "in the studies of the mott transition @xcite in the ground state of the hubbard model @xcite , there are well controlled results in the pure one - dimensional ( 1d ) case @xcite and in the limit of infinite dimensions @xcite only . in 1d",
    ", there is no metallic phase , the mott gap opens as soon as the interaction @xmath1 . in infinite dimensions ,",
    "the dynamical mean - field theory which is exact predicts a mott transition at the critical coupling , @xmath2 , @xmath3 is the band width .",
    "however , the transition has mean - field critical exponents .",
    "this anomaly is due to the local nature of the infinite dimensional solution .",
    "hence , the one - dimensional and the infinite dimensional solutions may not be directly applicable to experiments .",
    "studies of the mott transition in the hubbard beyond these special limits of one dimension and infinite dimension are thus of crucial importance .    for more than a decade , a great deal of effort has been devoted to applying quantum cluster theories @xcite to the study of the mott transition in the hubbard model in two dimensions ( 2d ) .",
    "quantum cluster theories include non - local correlations .",
    "they predict a finite critical value for the interaction at the transition .",
    "this critical value depends on the cluster size .",
    "however , when applied to a finite dimensional model , they are exact only in the limit of infinite cluster size . in quantum cluster theories , the effect of the interaction on physical quantities such as the single - particle green s function",
    "is restricted to the cluster sites .",
    "the correlation are fully accounted for distances which are smaller than the cluster length , @xmath4 .",
    "when @xmath5 , the green s function has an effective mean - field decay . restricting the effect of the interaction at distances @xmath4",
    "is probably justified away enough from the critical point where the correlations are expected to be short - ranged .",
    "a consequence of this restriction of the correlations to the cluster length is that the exponents at the transition are always mean - field like for a fixed cluster size @xcite .",
    "a systematic finite cluster size analysis is therefore necessary for a correct description of the transition .",
    "however , most of applications of quantum cluster simulations have been done on relatively small clusters .",
    "these are not enough to reliably predict the low - energy physics at the quantum critical point .",
    "unlike the fermionic model , in the 2d bose - hubbard model which displays a transition from a superfluid to a mott insulator , analytical approaches @xcite and large scale monte carlo simulations @xcite have yielded reliable information about its critical behavior .",
    "the transition for fixed boson density belongs to the universality class of the classical three - dimensional ( 3d ) xy model .",
    "this has also been reported on the 2d jaynes - cummings - hubbard model @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , for the fermionic hubbard model monte carlo simulations predict @xmath6 .",
    "this is because of the nesting induced slater transition @xcite . in absence of perfect nesting ,",
    "the monte carlo method is hampered by the sign problem .",
    "large scale simulations are not possible .",
    "recent interest has been raised by slave rotor analyses @xcite .",
    "these analyses suggest that the transition in the 2d fermionic hubbard model may belong to the 3d xy universality class as the bosonic hubbard model . in ref.@xcite",
    "a slave rotor representation of the fermionic operator @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a spinless boson and @xmath9 a charge - less spin , was used to map the hubbard model to a free spinon hamiltonian self - consistently coupled to a bosonic term ( or xy term in a spin representation of bosons ) .",
    "the fermionic mott transition is in this form a transition between condensed ( fermi liquid ) and non - condensed ( mott insulator ) phases of bosons .",
    "this factorization may be justified in the mott phase where , because of the mott gap , spin and charge degrees of freedom may be separated . however , as the critical point is approached , is the gauge field weak enough to justify the decoupling between spin and charge ? if not would that modify the critical behavior predicted by the slave - rotor approximation ?",
    "only a non - biased calculation of the hubbard model can yield the answer .",
    "the slave - rotor prediction is in disagreement with an earlier approximate mapping @xcite of the hubbard model to a generalized blume - emery - griffiths model @xcite of the @xmath10 mixtures with an additional term whose effect on the nature of the transition is not known . in this mapping ,",
    "doubly occupied and empty sites corresponds to @xmath11 sites and singly occupied sites to @xmath12 sites .",
    "this mapping suggests instead that the hubbard model is in the universality class of the ising model .",
    "but the extra term which accompanies the blume - emery - griffiths model could well lead to another universality class .    in a recent paper @xcite",
    ", we reported a two - step density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) @xcite study of the mott transition in the ground state of the quasi - one - dimensional ( 1d ) hubbard model at half - filling .",
    "we find that in contrast to the pure 1d case for which there is no metallic phase , there is an authentic mott transition in the quasi-1d model .",
    "however , it is possible to argue that in the quasi-1d dimensional hubbard model studied in ref.@xcite , the fermi surface is perfectly nested , thus our analysis which predicts a gapless phase in the weak - coupling regime , would miss an exponentially small gap @xmath13 , that would open as a consequence of a slater transition .",
    "however , our numerical data did not support the existence of such a gap .",
    "arguments supporting a gap opening induced by perfect nesting are perturbative : the divergence of the non - interacting susceptibility @xmath14 at the nesting wave vector leads to that of the interacting spin susceptibility , @xmath15",
    ". however , the actual susceptibilities and interaction in the expression of @xmath16 are renormalized .",
    "attempts to compute the renormalized susceptibilities and interaction within the self - consistent parquet formalism @xcite lead to intractable equations .",
    "hence , the effect of these renormalization effects on the mean - field solution remains an open problem .    in this paper",
    ", we present a well controlled study of the mott transition in the hubbard model with a non - perfectly nested fermi surface beyond the special cases of 1d and infinite dimensions .",
    "the choice of the non - perfectly nested fermi surface precludes the theoretical possibility of a gap induced by the slater anti - ferromagnetism mechanism .",
    "the two - step dmrg method is first checked on the transition between a paramagnetic and an anti - ferromagnetic ground states in the quasi-1d heisenberg model with @xmath17 . in agreement with a quantum monte carlo study @xcite",
    ", we find that this transition belongs to universality class of the 3d classical heisenberg model . for the quasi-1d hubbard model",
    ", we find that , in contrast to the pure one - dimensional model , there is a genuine ground - state mott transition at a finite critical value of the interaction .",
    "data analysis of the critical behavior of this model show that , in agreement with the mapping to the blume - emery - griffiths model @xcite , the mott transition in the 2d hubbard model belongs to the universality class of the 2d ising model .",
    "we consider the hubbard model with the local interaction @xmath18 and the following non - interacting single - particle energies ,    @xmath19    the hopping parameters @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , respectively in the longitudinal , transverse , and diagonal directions , are illustrated in fig.[lattice ] .",
    "the presence of @xmath22 ensures that the non - interacting fermi surface is not perfectly nested . @xmath21 and",
    "@xmath22 must be @xmath23 for the two - step dmrg method to be accurate . in this study",
    ", we set @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the choice of this model thus precludes the theoretical possibility of the nesting induced exponentially small gap .",
    "the band - width is @xmath26 , we set @xmath27 .    ,",
    "transverse @xmath21 , and diagonal @xmath22 hopping parameters.,height=151 ]",
    "the two - step dmrg is a generalization of the conventional dmrg method @xcite to quasi-1d hamiltonians .",
    "the dmrg is a rg procedure in which the reduced density - matrix is used to retain the most important states of the system .",
    "the dmrg itself is a crucial improvement over the block rg method @xcite which extended the wilson rg method @xcite used in the solution of the kondo impurity problem to lattice models .",
    "the block method has a major handicap , by dividing the lattice into independent blocks , it neglects at its initial step the inter - block interaction .",
    "but if the inter - block interaction is of the same order as the intra - block interaction , this introduces an error from which it is difficult to recover even by keeping a large number of states . in the dmrg",
    "the lattice is built by initially coupling the block to the rest of the lattice .",
    "let us consider a system ( s ) coupled to an environment ( e ) , let @xmath28 and @xmath29 be respectively the number of states respectively of the system and for the environment .",
    "let @xmath30 be for instance the ground - state wave function of the super - system including the system and the environment ,    @xmath31    where the @xmath32 s represent the system s basis states and the @xmath33 s the environment basis states ; @xmath28 and @xmath29 are respectively the total number of states of the system and of the environment .",
    "the essence of the rg procedure is the truncation of the hilbert s space , starting with a small system for which the total number of states can be kept , at some step when the lattice gets large , only a smaller number @xmath34 of the system s states can be kept .",
    "the error in this truncation is given by the eigenvalues @xmath35 of the reduced density - matrix of the system ,    @xmath36    from the relation ,    @xmath37    the error made by representing the system by @xmath38 states instead of @xmath28 is given by ,    @xmath39    for a large number of 1d models , @xmath40 is very small if @xmath38 is only a few hundreds .",
    "application of the dmrg method to heisenberg chains with @xmath41 or @xmath17 @xcite , @xmath42 , the ground - state energy , correlation functions and lowest excitation gap were obtained with an astonishing accuracy .",
    "it was hoped that , given the level of accuracy of the dmrg for 1d models , the method would also perform reasonably well for 2d models . however , for a 2d lattice , the value of @xmath38 necessary to retain good accuracy appears to increase exponentially with the system size .",
    "this is related to the entropy area law which predicts an exponential increase of @xmath43 in 2d .",
    "the entropy area law implies that the direct application of the 2d dmrg would only be limited to relatively narrow systems , it however leaves a window of success for quasi-1d systems as we will explain below .",
    "the study of quasi-1d models would yield valuable information about the corresponding isotropic models .",
    "most importantly the two - step approach had a direct relevance to the physical properties of quasi-1d materials for which @xmath44 such as the organic and inorganic quasi-1d conductors .",
    "let us consider for instance the hubbard chain with a charge gap @xmath45 .",
    "if the transverse coupling @xmath21 is infinitely small with respect to @xmath45 , so that the system remains in the same phase as the decoupled chains .",
    "it is obvious that the decoupled chain limit is a good starting point to describe the weakly - coupled chain system .",
    "as @xmath21 increases , the quality of decoupled chain as a starting point will decrease , if the same number of states is kept , until @xmath21 reaches a quantum critical point @xmath46 at which the systems enters in the 2d regime . in principle , when @xmath21 is in the 2d phase , it would be wrong to start from the decoupled chain limit .",
    "this is because there are a huge number of low - lying states with nearly equal weight in the reduced density - matrix .",
    "the important point which nevertheless makes calculations possible is that actual calculations are done on finite systems which have a discrete spectrum .",
    "thus even if @xmath21 has a value corresponding to the 2d phase for a system size @xmath47 , given the discreteness of the energy spectrum for a finite system , if the energy width of the states kept is such that @xmath48 , starting from decoupled chain might still lead to accurate results .",
    "for such a system , the dmrg can be used to study the ground - state phase transition since it will display a different scaling behavior above and below @xmath46 .",
    "the same type of analysis may be used for gap - less chains as well , @xmath49 will yield the relevant energy scale above and below the transition .",
    "the separation of the energy scales is basic idea of the two - step dmrg @xcite .",
    "the two - step dmrg uses the extraordinary accuracy that the dmrg can achieve in 1d in two steps . in the first step ,",
    "the low - energy hamiltonian is obtained accurately using the dmrg .",
    "then , in the next step small transverse perturbations are inserted .",
    "the 2d effective hamiltonian is 1d , the dmrg is again applied to solve the problem in the transverse direction . indeed",
    ", this procedure is valid only if the transverse couplings are very small with respect to the longitudinal couplings .",
    "the success of the two - step dmrg in yielding reliable results on the eventual new physics induced by the perturbation will depend on the value of the critical transverse coupling necessary to drive the systems in a new phase . if the magnitude of the perturbation @xmath21 necessary to drive the system away from the 1d physics is small in comparison with the width of the states kept , the two - step dmrg is expected to be successful .",
    "this is for instance the case of coupled haldane chains studied in section [ fsc ] .",
    "however , if the magnitude of the perturbation is too large , the two - step dmrg would not be able to describe the 2d physics accurately .    the real challenge in the two - step starts after finishing making the program code work .",
    "the essential part of the subsequent activity is finding a region in the parameter space of a given model where interesting physical results can be extracted . for more details about the two - step dmrg",
    ", we refer the reader to ref.@xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the first step of the dmrg ,",
    "we targeted charge sectors with @xmath50 , where @xmath29 corresponds to the number of electrons at half - filling ; for each charge sector , we targeted the spin sectors with the lowest @xmath51 ; hence we targeted a total of @xmath52 charge - spin sectors during each dmrg iteration .",
    "the reduced density - matrix was given by ,    @xmath53    where we assigned an equal weight @xmath54 to each state @xmath55 .",

    "it can be seen that the value of @xmath158 is still appreciable at the quantum critical point @xmath166 .",
    "significantly more work will be necessary in order to reliably extract the order parameter exponent @xmath167 .     of the mott transition as function of @xmath116 for a @xmath92 system.,height=151 ]",
    "in this paper , we used the two - step dmrg to analyze the finite size behavior of the quasi - particle gap in the ground - state mott transition in the quasi-1d hubbard model .",
    "we chose a non - bipartite lattice to avoid the issue related to the possible nesting induced slater transition .",
    "we studied systems ranging from @xmath168 to @xmath105 .",
    "we were able to find the universality class of the mott transition in an un - biased calculation .",
    "in contrast to the pure 1d model , we find that the quasi-1d models displays a genuine mott transition at a finite critical interaction",
    ". moreover , the quasi-1d solution does not have the pathologies of the infinite dimensional solution .",
    "it could thus serve as a basis for more realistic studies of the detailed and well controlled analysis of the mott transition .",
    "the critical behavior of the quasi-1d model hubbard model is found to belong to the universality class of the 2d ising model .",
    "the fact that the transitions in the quasi-1d heisenberg and hubbard models belong to the universality classes of their isotropic counterparts shows that despite the restriction of the two - step dmrg method to highly anisotropic 2d models , it is nevertheless very useful for the understanding of the physics of isotropic 2d systems .",
    "we did not discuss the spin degrees of freedom .",
    "they are expected to be gap - less in either side of the mott transition . in the insulating phase , in the strong coupling limit @xmath169 ,",
    "the anisotropic frustrated hubbard model is equivalent to the anisotropic @xmath170 model with @xmath171 , @xmath172 , and @xmath173 , where @xmath174 , @xmath86 , and @xmath175 are respectively the exchange parameter in the longitudinal , transverse , and diagonal directions .",
    "our choice @xmath176 implies that the ground state will be magnetically ordered with the momentum @xmath177 . for intermediate @xmath18 , in the mott insulator phase",
    ", double occupation is not negligible straighforward mapping to the heisenberg model is not valid .",
    "however , the charge gap opening implies spin - charge separation .",
    "thus even in this case , the effective low - energy hamiltonian should be heisenberg like , albeit with non - trivial exchange parameters .",
    "magnetic long - range order should be expected . however , a gap - less spin - liquid ground state with a spinon fermi surface as suggested in ref.@xcite is also possible .",
