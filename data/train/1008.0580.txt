    "a simple extension of the standard model ( sm ) by right - handed neutrinos provides the framework for describing neutrino masses and the observed neutrino oscillations  @xcite ( for reviews see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "current observations , however , do not allow to establish the majorana or dirac nature of neutrinos . while the smallness of the neutrino mass can be naturally explained by introducing majorana mass terms and making use of the see - saw mechanism , dirac masses for neutrinos with very small yukawa couplings are a viable and interesting alternative .",
    "in supersymmetric models , one may naturally obtain very light dirac neutrino masses from f - term susy breaking  @xcite .",
    "in addition to providing an explanation for neutrino masses , this class of supersymmetric models offers an interesting alternative dark matter ( dm ) candidate , the sneutrino . indeed in these models",
    "one can generate a weak - scale trilinear @xmath5 term that is not proportional to the small neutrino yukawa couplings .",
    "thus large mixing between left - handed ( lh ) and right - handed ( rh ) sneutrinos can be induced even though the yukawa couplings are extremely small .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with the usual mssm where the trilinear @xmath6 terms are proportional to the yukawa couplings so that mixing effects can be neglected for the first two generations of sfermions .",
    "the lightest sneutrino can thus become the lightest susy particle ( lsp ) and a viable thermal dm candidate .",
    "because of the large sneutrino mixing , the mainly rh sneutrino is no longer sterile , its couplings to sm gauge and higgs bosons are driven by the mixing with its lh partner .",
    "sufficient mixing provides efficient annihilation so that one can obtain a value for the relic density of @xmath7 as extracted from cosmological observations  @xcite .",
    "direct detection ( dd ) experiments pose severe constraints on dirac or complex scalar , i.e.  not self - conjugated , dm particles because the spin - independent elastic scattering cross - section receives an important contribution from z exchange , which typically exceeds experimental bounds . in the mixed sneutrino model , this cross - section",
    "is suppressed by the sneutrino mixing angle .",
    "therefore , on the one hand a viable sneutrino dm candidate requires enough mixing to provide sufficient pair - annihilation , on the other hand the mixing should not be too large in order not to exceed the dd limits . here",
    "we will explore the parameter space of the model where these conditions are satisfied .",
    "it is intriguing that a mixed sneutrino also opens the possibility for a supersymmetric dm candidate below 10  gev .",
    "light dm candidates have received a lot of attention recently  @xcite because of results of dd experiments that show hints of events compatible with light dm .",
    "this includes the modulation signal from dama  @xcite as well as recent results from cogent  @xcite and cdms  @xcite .",
    "the best fit values for the mass and the cross - section do not overlap when these results are interpreted as a spin - independent contribution , nevertheless analyses taking into account the signal s dependence on the dm velocity distribution have shown @xcite that the observed events can be compatible with the null results obtained by other experiments such as xenon  @xcite .",
    "in addition , cresst - ii has very recently reported 32 events with an expected background of @xmath8 , compatible with a dm mass of 15  gev or below and a spin - independent cross - section of a few times @xmath9  pb @xcite .    whether or not these events",
    "are confirmed , the possibility of light dm with large elastic scattering cross - sections remains interesting and particularly challenging to probe because experiments suffer from a severe loss of sensitivity at low masses .",
    "furthermore , the mixed sneutrino revives the possibility of light dm in the mssm : although it is possible to find a light neutralino that has the right properties to satisfy dm constraints in the mssm with non - universal gaugino masses , this scenario is incompatible with additional constraints on the model  @xcite .",
    "indeed efficient annihilation requires additional light particles , for example a second doublet higgs with mass in the 100  gev range , which is strongly constrained by b - physics processes , in particular @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "a light neutralino is still possible in singlet extensions of the mssm where new higgs singlets provide additional possibilities for efficient annihilation of the lightest neutralino  @xcite .",
    "the phenomenology of the mixed - sneutrino model that we examine here was first investigated in  @xcite .",
    "indirect detection signatures were discussed in  @xcite , and lhc signatures in  @xcite .",
    "we extend on these analyses in several ways .",
    "first of all , in contrast to the above mentioned studies , we here concentrate on light dm with mass of about 10  gev and below .",
    "second , we explore the parameter space of the model that gives a consistent sneutrino dm candidate using up - to - date constraints on elastic scattering cross - sections , examining also the effects of uncertainties in , e.g. , the dm velocity distribution . in our scans , we take into account radiative corrections to the susy and higgs spectrum ; in particular we include the 1-loop corrections to the sneutrino mass originating from the higgs contribution , and those to the light higgs mass originating from the large @xmath11 term .",
    "moreover , we consider both the case of one and of three sneutrino flavours , assuming complete degeneracy in the three flavour case . for the allowed scenarios ,",
    "we explore the consequences for dd as well as for indirect detection in photons , antiparticles and neutrinos .",
    "finally , we explore the consequences for searches at the lhc and ilc .",
    "we characterize the scenarios that satisfy the dd constraints , including those that are within the region favoured by cogent ( and maybe also cresst ) .",
    "the allowed scenarios have specific characteristics which include , e.g. , dominantly invisible higgs decays .",
    "besides , if the charged sleptons are heavier than the @xmath12 and @xmath13 , as is the case over most of the valid parameter space , this implies dominantly invisible decays of neutralinos ( @xmath14 ) and single - lepton decays of charginos ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : model ] describes the framework of our analysis , giving details on the model , the mass spectrum , and radiative corrections .",
    "section  [ sec : constraints ] then discusses collider constraints , sneutrino annihilation and direct detection .",
    "the relic density and dd predictions for the one light sneutrino case are analyzed in section  [ sec : onesnu ] , including a discussion of astrophysical uncertainties .",

    "are given in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",

    "all numerical results have been obtained with  @xcite , linked to an appropriately modified version of  @xcite .",
    "the framework for our study is the model of @xcite with only dirac masses for sneutrinos . in this case , the usual mssm soft - breaking terms are extended by @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath5 are weak - scale soft terms , which we assume to be flavour - diagonal .",
    "note that the lepton - number violating bilinear term , which appears in case of majorana neutrino masses , is absent . neglecting the tiny dirac masses , the @xmath18 sneutrino mass matrix for one generation",

    ", we will always assume @xmath26 so that the lighter mass eigenstate , @xmath27 , is mostly a @xmath0 .",
    "it is in fact quite natural to obtain this relation when embedding the model in a gut scale model , because the renormalization group running of @xmath28 is governed by @xmath29 , while for @xmath30 the running at 1  loop is driven exclusively by the @xmath5 term , since @xmath0 is a sm singlet .",
    "a large @xmath5 term in the sneutrino mass matrix will induce a significant mixing between the lh and rh states , @xmath31 where @xmath32 and the mixing angle @xmath33 notice that for fixed @xmath34 , @xmath35 is proportional to @xmath36 .",
    "this means that @xmath35 is of the same order as other soft terms in the sneutrino sector .",
    "a large value of @xmath35 can induce a large splitting between the two mass eigenstates even if @xmath20 and @xmath17 are of the same order , leading to scenarios where @xmath37 . in this way",

    "the model can easily be generalized to three generations .",
    "when doing so we will neglect for simplicity any flavour mixing in the sneutrino sector .",
    "the couplings of the mostly sterile @xmath27 are those of the lh sneutrino suppressed by a factor @xmath39 due to mixing .",
    "in addition , there is a new direct coupling between the higgs bosons and the lh and rh sneutrino components proportional to @xmath35 .",
    "the couplings to the z and light higgs boson will play a crucial role both for annihilation processes and for the elastic scattering cross - section . the coupling of sneutrinos to neutrinos and neutralinos is dominated by the wino component of the neutralinos and will be important for the annihilation of sneutrinos into neutrinos .",
    "the relevant feynman rules are given explicitly in the appendix .",
    "we assume a model with soft terms defined at the weak scale and unification of gaugino masses at the gut scale .",
    "the latter leads to @xmath40 at the weak scale . for the sneutrino sector",

    "note that this choice has no effect as concerns dm properties , but can have implications for collider searches as will be discussed in section  [ sec : colliders ] .",
    "in the one - generation case , we assume that only the tau - sneutrino is light and all others are heavy , with soft masses of 1  tev . in the three - generation case , on the other hand , complete degeneracy between the slepton generations is assumed .    for the squark sector , we assume a common soft mass @xmath47  tev and take @xmath48  tev in order to avoid the constraint on the light higgs mass .",

    "the reason for this is that for a large cross - section it is necessary to have a light particle exchanged in the t - channel . for neutralino production",
    "this means a light selectron , which is only possible in our 3 generation model .",
    "likewise , @xmath110 production , which is enhanced by t - channel chargino exchange , is contributing only in the 3 generation case .",

    "in the case of three light sneutrinos , the constraint from the z width on the sneutrino mixing angle is stronger .",

    "this is because the effective annihilation cross - section including the coannihilation channels is @xmath252 where @xmath253 is the number of degrees of freedom and @xmath254 the cross - section for annihilation of two supersymmetric particles , @xmath255 into sm particles .",
    "thus when annihilation is dominated by the processes @xmath256 , @xmath257 increases by a factor of 3 as compared with the one generation case .",

    "the sneutrino mixing is around @xmath260 , while the slepton masses are restricted to @xmath261  gev .",

    "[ fig : posi ] we see that the positron flux from @xmath38 dm annihilation reaches at most @xmath361 in the med ( min ) model and hence is always smaller than the secondary flux .",
    "an important characteristic of the light sneutrino dm scenario is the invisible decay of the light higgs  @xcite . at the lhc",
    ", the search for an invisible higgs will be performed in the ww fusion channel with a signature in 2 tagged jets and missing @xmath362 . defining the ratio @xmath363 , the region to be probed with @xmath364  fb@xmath365 at @xmath366  tev corresponds to @xmath367 for a higgs mass below 150  gev  @xcite . in our sneutrino dm scenarios ,",
    "the light higgs is sm - like and the invisible decay @xmath368 overwhelmingly dominant ( @xmath369 ) , making for a good higgs discovery potential in the invisible channel .",
    "the susy signatures also differ from the expectations in the conventional mssm : while squarks and gluinos have the usual cascade decays through charginos and neutralinos , with the same branching ratios as in the corresponding mssm case ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , here the charginos and neutralinos decay further into the @xmath38 lsp . for 90% of the allowed parameter points of our scans , both the @xmath103 and the @xmath104 decay to practically 100% into @xmath370 , leading to larger missing @xmath362 than naively expected for a lsp that weighs only a few gev .",
    "( the @xmath103 in fact always decays invisibly . )",
    "note also that in this case @xmath371 and @xmath372 give the same signature of jet+@xmath373 , differing only in the jet-@xmath374 and @xmath373 distributions .",
    "the @xmath245 also decays directly into the lsp , with br@xmath375 in the large majority of the cases .",
    "this means that decay chains involving charginos should on average have less missing @xmath362 than chains involving neutralinos .",
    "it also means that @xmath376 production leads to a single charged lepton rather than the usual trilepton signature .",
    "furthermore if , as we have assumed , the lsp is the tau - sneutrino , the charged lepton will be a tau .",
    "this picture depends only little on most of the parameters that we have fixed in the scans , in particular the value of the higgsino mass parameter @xmath180 hardly influences the picture ( lowering @xmath180 increases a bit the @xmath377 decays , but these add to the single lepton events , although in a flavour - democratic way ) .",
    "the situation is , however , different for the first and second generation slepton masses : lowering them far enough can open up the @xmath378 and/or @xmath379 decay channels ( @xmath380 ) , and this crucially influences the experimental signatures . setting , for instance , @xmath381  gev in the dm",
    "allowed scan points , while assuming that the rh @xmath382 are heavy , gives @xmath378 decay branching ratios of typically up to 30% , and up to 50% if the decay into @xmath383 is suppressed by a small mixing angle ( the rest goes into lh @xmath382 s ) .",
    "note that decays into staus are mostly absent in this case .",
    "taking , as may seem more natural , @xmath384 , @xmath385 and @xmath386 brings us back to the situation that invisible neutralino decays are overwhelmingly dominant .",
    "the @xmath245 decays democratically into all three lepton flavours in this case , @xmath387 , with only a small preference for @xmath388 . finally , for @xmath389 we recover the situation discussed in the previous paragraph , with @xmath390 and @xmath391 having practically 100% branching ratio .",
    "a detailed study of the lhc potential to resolve the light sneutrino dm scenario , including in particular the determination of the dm mass from @xmath392 events , is left for future work .      at an international linear collider ( ilc ) with @xmath393  gev ,",
    "the main production for the light higgs is @xmath394 .",
    "this allows for precision measurements even if the @xmath212 decays entirely via invisible modes as is the case in our model  @xcite .",
    "the main susy production processes at the ilc are @xmath395 as well as @xmath396 ( and maybe selectrons and smuons , depending on the scenario ) .",
    "( black ) and @xmath397 ( green ) at @xmath393  gev as a function of @xmath242 , and of @xmath398 ( red ) as a function of @xmath399 for the allowed scenarios with one light sneutrino . also shown is the single photon cross - section assuming @xmath400 .",
    "[ fig : lc ] , width=302 ]    chargino - pair production has the largest cross - section and should be easily measurable , as is illustrated in fig .  [",
    "fig : lc ] .",
    "the peculiarity of the sneutrino dm model is that the chargino decay gives a single charged lepton plus missing energy , see the discussion in the previous subsection .",
    "the cross - section for stau - pair production can reach 70fb if the staus are kinematically accessible .",
    "this occurs , however , only for a small fraction of the successful dm models , cf .",
    "[ fig : stau ] .",
    "the rather heavy staus in our scenarios are a consequence of setting @xmath401 .",
    "this assumption was not important for the dm study but has a strong impact here .",
    "furthermore , the assumption of heavy selectrons and smuons means that the most favourable production processes , notably @xmath402 and @xmath403 , are kinematically not accessible . relaxing this assumption , for example by assuming universality in the slepton masses , could give large selectron / smuon pair - production cross - sections and would also affect chargino - pair production , which depends on the mass of the lh @xmath404 .",
    "as mentioned , neutral particles have large branching fractions into invisible states .",
    "in fact , the @xmath405 decays both have nearly 100% branching fractions .",
    "therefore , @xmath406 and @xmath407 ( @xmath408 ) pair production will all contribute to the single photon cross - section .",
    "we have computed the total single photon cross - section exactly using calchep  @xcite with the cuts @xmath409  gev and @xmath410 .",
    "monte carlo simulations of this process including backgrounds have shown that cross sections around @xmath270  fb could be detectable using beam polarisation  @xcite . for the allowed points from section  [ sec : onesnu ] , the predictions for the unpolarised cross - section are mostly below 1  fb although the cross - section can reach up to 2  pb when @xmath411  gev , cf .  the green points in fig .  [ fig : lc ] .",
    "the dominant contribution arises from the @xmath406 channel .",
    "the mass of the selectron is again a crucial parameter for these processes . to illustrate its impact",
    "we have also computed the single photon cross - section fixing @xmath412 ( instead of 1  tev ) .",
    "this increases the single photon cross - section by up to one order of magnitude , see the blue points in fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] .",
    "this is due mainly to the increase in neutralino production .",
    "note finally that although there can be an important additional higgs production mode through the decay @xmath413 , this is not detectable since the higgs decays invisibly .",
    "furthermore , in our model the @xmath414 is often too heavy to be pair produced with @xmath415  gev .",
    "in supersymmetric models with dirac neutrino masses , a weak - scale trilinear @xmath5 term that is not proportional to the small neutrino yukawa couplings can induce a sizable mixing between lh and rh sneutrinos and render the lighter sneutrino mass eigenstate a viable dark matter candidate .",
    "in particular , the mixed sneutrino can be an excellent candidate for light susy dm with mass below @xmath41610  gev , as we have shown in this paper .    to obtain a very light @xmath38",
    "requires some fine - tuning , as the soft - breaking terms in the sneutrino mass matrix are all of the weak scale .",
    "moreover , a viable sneutrino dm candidate requires enough mixing to provide sufficient pair - annihilation , while on the other hand the mixing should not be too large in order not to exceed the dd limits or contribute too much to the z invisible decay width .",
    "in addition , the 1-loop diagrams involving sneutrinos induce a negative correction to the light higgs mass , which can attain a few gev for large @xmath35 . in a random scan over @xmath417 points for the case of one light sneutrino contributing to the dm , we found close to 2000 points that survive all present constraints , including the z invisible decay width , the higgs and susy mass limits , as well as dark matter constraints from the relic abundance and the direct detection experiments .",
    "these points populate the region @xmath418  gev .",
    "we also found that for very light @xmath38 below ca .",
    "5  gev , small @xmath419  gev is preferred in order to enhance @xmath420 annihilation through t - channel wino exchange . in the case of three degenerate light sneutrinos ,",
    "the constrains are much stronger and only few points pass all constraints .    our results for direct and indirect detection of light sneutrino dm can be summarized as follows .",
    "first , the cross - section for the spin - independent elastic scattering on nuclei is predicted to be @xmath421  pb .",
    "that is at most within an order of magnitude of present limits for dm masses around 510  gev , and it includes the region favoured by cogent ( and perhaps cresst ) .",
    "second , sneutrino pair annihilation into @xmath137 and @xmath327 can lead to large distortions of the positron and antiproton spectra at low energies .",
    "these are being probed by pamela .",
    "furthermore , the photon flux can be in the range being probed by fermilat , provided again the @xmath38 s annihilate significantly into @xmath137 and @xmath327 . in all cases",
    "the signals are expected in the low energy range ( ca .",
    "@xmath422  gev ) , a region where measurements are not as precise as for higher energies .",
    "third , the neutrino flux resulting from @xmath38 capture in the sun can also be large .",
    "however , because the energy of the neutrinos is bounded by the dm mass , these scenarios are harder to probe than those with typical weak scale dm .",
    "in fact the neutrino energy is below the threshold of the large detectors .",
    "only superkamiokande has a low enough threshold to have some sensitivity to neutrinos from light sneutrino annihilation , though these neutrinos do not have enough energy to induce muons that go through the detector .",
    "one can therefore use only events where muons are stopped in the detector .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the predicted flux for antineutrinos , and thus for antimuons , is often much larger than that for muons .    while the scenarios with @xmath38 dm that annihilates preferentially into @xmath423 have good prospects of being detected in the near future , those that have a dm mass below ca .",
    "2  gev will mostly escape detection .",
    "indeed direct detection experiments lack sensitivity for these masses .",
    "moreover , the main annihilation channel in this case is into neutrinos , leaving low chances for indirect detection in photons , antiprotons and positrons ; some possibilities remain if the annihilation into @xmath327 is significant .",
    "even the neutrino telescopes can not make use of the large branching fraction for annihilation into neutrinos , because the evaporation process in the sun strongly suppresses the neutrino flux for such light @xmath38 s .",
    "finally a mixed sneutrino lsp leaves distinct signatures in collider experiments .",
    "most notably the light higgs boson and the two lightest neutralinos decay almost exclusively into invisible modes , while decays of the lighter chargino give a single charged lepton plus missing energy . at the lhc ,",
    "the typical cascade decays therefore are @xmath424 , @xmath425 and @xmath426 , all giving different amount of missing @xmath362 .",
    "moreover , @xmath427 production gives only a single charged lepton . at the ilc , @xmath406 and @xmath407 ( @xmath408 ) pair production",
    "will all contribute to the single photon cross - section .",
    "the details of the dm signatures at colliders depend of course on the assumptions that are made on the rest of the spectrum , in particular the first and second generation of sleptons . the predictions in astroparticle experiments have uncertainties from astrophysical and nuclear parameters . these include uncertainties in the quark content of the nucleon , on the local dark matter density and velocity distribution , on the dark matter halo profile and , for charged cosmic rays , on the parameters of the propagation model .",
    "last but not least if signals are found in astroparticle and collider experiments , the challenge will be to determine the precise dm properties and the underlying new physics .",
    "this requires in particular collider measurements of the masses and couplings of the dm and other new particles associated with it in order to refine and test the theoretical predictions for astroparticle observables .",
    "moreover , if an @xmath373 signal is seen at the lhc , it should be confirmed in direct dm detection and vice versa , the agreement of the dm mass and cross - section determined in the two ways being a crucial test . to this end",
    "it will be interesting to investigate how well our light sneutrino dm scenarios can be resolved at the lhc by exploiting the @xmath424 cascade decay .",
    "such a signature has been suggested in  @xcite as a method of measuring mass differences in the mssm .",
