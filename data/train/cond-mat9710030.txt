    "protein folding @xcite is one of the most interesting and challenging problems in polymer physics and mathematical biology .",
    "it is concerned with the problem of how a heteropolymer of a given sequence of amino acids folds into precisely that geometrical shape in which it performs its biological function as a molecular machine @xcite .",
    "currently , it is much simpler to find coding dna  and , thus , also amino acid  sequences than to elucidate the 3-@xmath0 structures of given proteins .",
    "therefore , solving the protein folding problem would be a major break - through in understanding the biochemistry of the cell , and , furthermore , in designing artificial proteins .    in this contribution we are concerned with the direct approach : given a sequence of amino acids , a molecular potential , and no other information , find the ground state and the equilibrium state at physiological temperatures .",
    "note that we are not concerned with the kinetics of folding , but only in the final outcome .",
    "also , we will not address the problems of how to find good molecular potentials @xcite , and what is the proper level of detail in describing proteins @xcite .",
    "instead , we will use simple coarse - grained models which have been proposed in the literature and have become standards in testing the efficiency of folding algorithms .",
    "a plethora of methods have been proposed to solve this problem , ranging from simple metropolis monte carlo simulations at some nonzero temperature @xcite over multi - canonical simulation approaches @xcite to stochastic optimization schemes based , e.g. , on simulated annealing @xcite , and genetic algorithms @xcite .",
    "alternative methods use heuristic principles @xcite , information from databases of known protein structures , @xcite , sometimes in combination with known physico - chemical properties of small peptides . the algorithms we apply here are variants of the pruned - enriched rosenbluth method ( perm ) @xcite .",
    "this is a chain growth approach based on the rosenbluth - rosenbluth ( rr ) @xcite method .",
    "preliminary results have been published before @xcite . here",
    "we will provide more details on the algorithm and on the analyses that can be performed , and we will present more detailed results on ground state and spectral properties , and on the folding behavior of the sequences analyzed .",
    "the models we study in this contribution are heteropolymers that live on 2- and 3-dimensional regular lattices .",
    "they are self - avoiding chains with attractive or repulsive interactions between neighboring non - bonded monomers .",
    "the majority of authors considered only two kinds of monomers .",
    "although also different interpretations are possible for such a binary choice , e.g. in terms of positive and negative electric charges @xcite , the most important model of this class is the hp model @xcite .",
    "there , the two monomer types are assumed to be hydrophobic ( h ) and polar ( p ) , with energies @xmath1 for interaction between not covalently bound neighbors .",
    "since this parameter set leads to highly degenerate ground states , alternative parameters were proposed , e.g. @xmath2 @xcite and @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "note , however , that in these latter parameter sets , since they are symmetric upon exchange of h and p , the intuitive distinction between hydrophilic and polar monomers gets lost .",
    "an interesting extension to the hp model can be obtained by allowing the interactions to be anisotropic .",
    "this is done by introducing amphipatic ( a ) monomers that have hydrophobic as well as polar sides @xcite .",
    "such a generalization is possible for all lattice types , but we confine ourselves to two dimensions ( 2d ) here .",
    "it can be shown that in this hap model for a wide range of interaction parameters the inverse folding problem  i.e. the determination of a sequence that has a particular conformation as ground state  can be solved by construction @xcite . while 3-dimensional chiral amphipatic monomers can be considered as well as non - chiral ( the sides are allowed to rotate in the latter ) , in 2d only non - chiral monomers are possible .    in the other extremal case of models , all monomers of a sequence are considered to be different , and interaction energies",
    "are drawn randomly from a continuous distribution @xcite .",
    "these models correspond , effectively , to assuming an infinite number of monomer types .",
    "for the above models various sequences were analyzed in the literature , and in @xcite we took these analyses as a test for our algorithm . here we will take a closer look at the properties of some of the sequences that were considered there .",
    "-.2 cm    .newly found lowest energy states for binary sequences with interactions @xmath4 .",
    "configurations are encoded as sequences of _",
    "r_(ight),_l_(eft ) , _ u_(p ) , _",
    "d_(own ) , _ f_(orward ) , and _",
    "b_(ackward ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     and @xmath5 . with these ,",
    "average times for finding @xmath6 and @xmath7 in new tours are ca .",
    "20 min and 80 hours , respectively .",
    "a surprising result is that the monomers are arranged in four homogeneous layers in fig .",
    "[ 3d.struct.new ] , while they had formed only three layers in the putative ground state of fig .",
    "[ 3d.struct.old ] .",
    "since the interaction should favor the segregation of different type monomers , one might have guessed that a configuration with a smaller number of layers should be favored .",
    "we see that this is outweighed by the fact that both monomer types can form large double layers in the new configuration .",
    "again , our new ground state is not ` compact ' in the sense of minimizing the surface , and hence it also disagrees with the wide spread prejudice that native states are compact .    in terms of secondary structure ,",
    "the new ground state is fundamentally different from the putative ground state    of ref . @xcite . while the new structure ( fig .  [ 3d.struct.new ] ) is dominated by @xmath8 sheets , which can most clearly be seen in the contact matrix ( see fig .",
    "[ 3d.contact.new ] ) , the structure in fig .  [ 3d.struct.old ] is dominated by helices , see also the corresponding contact matrix in fig .",
    "[ 3d.contact.old ] .    in order to analyze the folding transition of this sequence we again constructed histograms of the distribution of energy , end to end distance , and radius of gyration , by combining the results obtained at various temperatures between @xmath9 and 3 .",
    "figure  [ hist.vs.e ] shows these distributions , reweighted so that it corresponds to @xmath10 .",
    "the thermal behavior of these order parameters as functions of @xmath11 is obtained by laplace transform , and is shown in fig .",
    "[ op.vs.t ] . the behavior of energy , end - to - end distance and radius of gyration follow closely each other and exhibit clearly only the smeared out collapse of the chain from a random coil to some unstructured compact phase .",
    "in contrast , the specific heat exhibits more structure : the shoulder around @xmath12 corresponds again to the coil - globule collapse , but there are additional transitions seen around @xmath13 and @xmath9 .",
    "the last one is the transition to the @xmath8-sheet dominated native phase .",
    "however , the transition at @xmath13 is from a unstructured globule to an intermediate phase that is helix - dominated but exhibits strong tertiary fluctuations .",
    "these structural transitions are illustrated in figs  [ contact.200 ] to [ contact.30 ] where the thermally averaged contact matrices are shown for the respective phases .",
    "the intermediate , helix - dominated phase is particularly interesting . to it",
    "apply some of the usual characteristics of a molten globule state @xcite : i ) compactness , ii ) large secondary structure content ( although not necessarily native ) , and iii ) strong fluctuations .",
    "this qualifies it as a candidate for a molten globule state , a phase that is absent in the folding transition of the hap sequence @xcite .      for all sequences with @xmath15 from @xcite we could reach the supposed ground state energies within @xmath16 hour . in no case",
    "we found energies lower than those quoted in @xcite , and we verified also the energies of low - lying excited states given in @xcite .",
    "notice that these sequences were designed to be good folders by the authors of @xcite .",
    "this time the design had obviously been successful , which is mainly due to the fact that the number of different monomer types is large .",
    "all sequences showed some gaps between the ground state and the bulk of low - lying states , although these gaps are not very pronounced in some cases .",
    "more conspicuous than these gaps was another feature : all low lying excited states were very similar to the ground state , as measured by the fraction of contacts which existed also in the native configuration .",
    "stated differently , if the gaps were not immediately obvious , this was because they were filled by configurations which were very similar to the ground state and can therefore easily transform into the native state and back .",
    "such states therefore can not prevent a sequence from being a good folder . for none of the sequences of @xcite we found truely misfolded low - lying states with small overlap with the ground state .",
    "figure  [ klimov.q.vs.e.single ] illustrates this feature for one particular sequence .",
    "there we show the _ overlap _ @xmath17 , defined as the fraction by non - bonded nearest - neighbor ground state contacts which exist also in the excited state , against the excitation energy .",
    "for this and for each of the following figures , the 500 lowest - lying states were determined .",
    "we see no low energy state with a small value of @xmath17 . to demonstrate that this is due to design , and is not a property of random sequences with the same potential distribution , we show in fig .",
    "[ klimov.q.vs.e.random.single ] the analogous distribution for a random sequence .",
    "to demonstrate that this difference is not merely due to a statistical fluctuation , we show in fig .",
    "[ klimov.q.vs.e.total ] the distributions for ten sequences from @xcite collected in a single plot . since the ground state energies differ considerably for different sequences , we used normalized excitation energies @xmath18 on the x - axis .",
    "analogous results for ten random sequences are shown in fig .",
    "[ klimov.q.vs.e.random.total ] . while there is no obvious correlation between @xmath17 and excitation energies for the random case ,",
    "all low energy states with small @xmath17 have been eliminated in the designed sequences ( note the different ranges of @xmath17 in figs .",
    "[ klimov.q.vs.e.total ] and [ klimov.q.vs.e.random.total ] ) .",
    "this elimination of truely misfolded low energy states without elimination of native - like low energy states might be an unphysical property of the design procedure used in @xcite , but we do not believe that this is the case . rather ,    it should be a general feature of any design procedure , including the one due to biological evolution .",
    "it contradicts the claim of @xcite that it is only the gap between native and first excited state which determines foldicity . on the other hand ,",
    "our results are consistent with the  funnel \" scenario for the protein folding process @xcite , where the folding pathway consists of states successively lower in energy and closer to the native state .",
    "we note that for random sequences there are also excited states that have unit overlap with the native state , a feature not present in the folding sequences .",
    "these are cases where the native state has open loops and/or dangling ends , so that more compact conformations have all contacts of the native state , but have  in addition  energetically unfavorable contacts resulting in a higher total energy .",
    "we showed that the pruned - enriched rosenbluth method ( perm ) can be very effectively applied to protein structure prediction in simple lattice models .",
    "it is suited for calculating statistical properties and is very successful in finding native states . in all cases it did better than any previous mc method , and in several cases it found lower energy states than those which had previously been conjectured to be native .",
    "we verified that ground states of the hp model are highly degenerate and have no gap , leading to bad folders . for sequences that are good folders",
    "we have established a funnel structure in state space : low - lying excited states of well - folding sequences have strong similarities to the ground state , while this is not true for non - folders with otherwise similar properties .",
    "especially , we have presented a new candidate for the native configuration of a  four helix bundle \" sequence which had been studied before by several authors .",
    "the ground state structure of the  four helix bundle \" sequence , being actually @xmath19-sheet dominated , differs strongly from the helix - dominated intermediate phase .",
    "this sequence , therefore , should not be a good folder .",
    "although we have considered only lattice models in this paper , we should stress that this is not an inherent limitation of perm .",
    "straightforward extensions to off - lattice systems are possible and are efficient for homopolymers at relatively high temperatures @xcite .",
    "preliminary attempts to study off - lattice heteropolymers at low @xmath11 have not yet been particularly successful , but the inherent flexibility of perm suggests several modifications which have not yet been investigated in detail .",
    "one of them are hybrid perm - metropolis approaches similar to that used for the hap model in the present paper .",
    "its success also suggests that similar hybrid approaches should be useful for models with more complicated monomers .",
    "another improvement of perm which could be particularly useful for off - lattice simulations might consist in more sophisticated algorithms for positioning the monomers when assembling the chain .",
    "work along these lines is in progress , and we hope to report on it soon .",
    "the authors are grateful to gerard barkema for helpful discussions during this work .",
    "one of them ( p.g . ) wants to thank also eytan domany and michele vendruscolo for very informative discussions , and to drs .",
    "d.k . klimov and r. ramakrishnan for correspondence .                                                                                          at first sight",
    ", one might believe that allowing the chain to grow at both ends should decrease the attrition rate and hence be advantageous .",
    "for homopolymers one can see easily that this is not true .",
    "attrition is actually decreased , since chains which have one end blocked can still grow at the other end .",
    "but such chains have small rosenbluth factors and thus extremely low @xmath21 in average .",
    "therefore , they just cost efforts without efficiently contributing to statistical averages . for heteropolymers",
    "this argument no longer holds , however , and it is not clear why growing the chain at both ends is not efficient either .    note , however , that there exists an alternative approach : for a fixed chain geometry a computationally effective ( @xmath22 instead of @xmath23 ) complete enumeration of all side group conformations is possible ; e. gerstner , p. grassberger and w. nadler , to be published .                in @xcite ,",
    "indications for the @xmath8-sheet phase were found , too , and on this basis an analogy to the competition of structures in the prion problem [ see , e.g. , j. nguyen _ et al .",
    "_ , biochemistry * 34 * , 4186 ( 1995 ) ] was drawn . however",
    ", our results showing that the helical phase is strongly structurally disordered demonstrate that this analogy can not be perfect . in a model for prions , both competing phases should be much more well defined ."
