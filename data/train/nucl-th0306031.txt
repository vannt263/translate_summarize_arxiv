    "many unusual subjects have been studied in the name of qcd .",
    "one of the more unusual , which has arisen in the field of heavy ion collisions , is the size of cross sections of charmonia on light hadrons .",
    "this has attracted attention because of the proposal by matsui and satz @xcite that suppression of @xmath0 production could be used as a signature for the formation of a quark - gluon plasma .",
    "absorption by light comovers.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=30.0% ] -0.3 cm    this suggestion , like many signatures proposed for the quark - gluon plasma , is perhaps excessively intuitive .",
    "the idea is that a qgp will screen the linear confining interaction between quarks , so that a @xmath1 pair produced within a qgp will be less likely to form a bound @xmath1 charmonium resonance , as in fig.1 , but instead will more likely separate to form open - charm mesons .",
    "even if this simple picture of @xmath1 production in a qgp is qualitatively correct , it can only be confirmed easily if the competing direct charm production and scattering by the initial relativistic nucleons is understood @xcite and if there is little subsequent dissociation of the charmonia by the many other  comoving \" light hadrons produced in such a collision . to summarize the last point , if charmonium + light hadron ",
    "comover \" dissociation cross sections are small ( case 1 , top of fig.1 ) and the background of direct charm production from the initial nucleons is understood , one may have a useful signature of qgp formation , but if the comover dissociation cross sections are large ( case 2 , bottom of fig.1 ) one must distinguish a qgp - reduced charmonium production amplitude from subsequent dissociative scattering , and the interpretation of this signal will therefore be ambiguous .",
    "thus it is of great relevance to the interpretation of rhic physics to establish the approximate size of these low - energy @xmath1 + light hadron cross sections .",
    "unfortunately we have no charmonium beams or targets , so the experimental cross sections must be inferred indirectly and are poorly known .",
    "the earliest estimates of lower energy charmonium hadronic cross sections came from @xmath0 photoproduction experiments in the mid 1970s , which were interpreted in terms of a @xmath0+n cross section given additional theoretical assumptions .",
    "early fermilab and slac photoproduction experiments gave rough estimates of @xmath2 mb for @xmath3 , assuming vector dominance , for photon energies from @xmath4 to @xmath5 gev @xcite . a subsequent slac photoproduction experiment in 1977 used the @xmath6 dependence of @xmath0 absorption to estimate a rather larger cross section of @xmath7 mb at @xmath8 gev ( @xmath9 gev ) @xcite .",
    "the vector dominance hypothesis may have lead to an underestimate of the cross section in the earlier references @xcite .    in heavy ion collisions",
    "these cross sections may be estimated from the ratio of lepton pairs produced in the @xmath0 peak to  background \" drell - yan pairs nearby in energy .",
    "since the @xmath0 must reach the exterior of the nuclear target to decay into a sharp mass peak , this ratio gives us an estimate of the absorption cross section through a classical survival probability formula , @xmath10 @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the mean nucleon density and l is the estimated mean path length in the experimental nuclear system .",
    "a  naive \" interpretation of the @xmath0 production data from collisions of various nuclear species using this formula gives @xmath13 mb at @xmath14 gev @xcite , with a numerically similar result for the @xmath15 .",
    "production versus path length @xcite ; the line corresponds to 6.2 mb.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ] -0.3 cm    of course one may raise many questions about the validity of this simple estimate , including the importance of shadowing in drell - yan , the neglect of @xmath0 scattering by other light hadrons formed in the collision ( for example @xmath16 and @xmath12 ) , and the assumption of a single , constant @xmath17n cross section in all circumstances .",
    "in addition to these more or less direct measurements there have been several attempts to infer charmonium cross sections from related processes , given additional theoretical assumptions .",
    "a series of theoretical papers @xcite has estimated the rather weak closed - flavor cross sections such as @xmath18 near threshold from the observed dipion decays ( here @xmath19 ) .",
    "et al _ @xcite have used charm photoproduction data combined with a vector dominance model to estimate the @xmath20 cross section , and find quite small values near threshold .",
    "@xcite again argue however that vector dominance is not justified for this process , so that the @xmath21 cross sections estimated in this manner are inaccurate .",
    "recently , concerns have been expressed that the @xmath0 and @xmath15 wavefunctions have not had sufficient time to form within the nucleus in these collisions , so experiment may instead be measuring the cross section for a small initial @xmath1  premeson \" on a nucleon .",
    "one can increase the time spent in the interior of the nuclear system by selecting small and even negative @xmath22 events , as has been done by e866 at fermilab .",
    "as discussed by he , hfner and kopeliovich @xcite , this leads one to infer @xmath23 mb and @xmath24 mb respectively , also at @xmath14 gev .",
    "this is rather more satisfying to people who have an intuitive notion that the larger @xmath15 should have a larger reaction cross section .",
    "actually the connection between cross section and physical extent is less direct ( compare kn and @xmath25n ) , and in any case the relative proximity of inelastic thresholds alone would suggest a larger @xmath15 cross section .",
    "these experiments also indicate a preference for dissociation over elastic cross sections in this energy region by roughly a factor of 30 @xcite .",
    "to quote b.mller in 1999 ,  ... the state of the theory of interactions between @xmath0 and light hadrons is embarrassing [ ... ] .",
    "only three serious calculations exist ( after more than 10 years of intense discussions about this issue ! ) and their results differ by at least two orders of magnitude in the relevant energy range [ ... ] . there is a lot to do for those who would like to make a serious contribution to an important topic .",

    "the theoretical situation has improved considerably in recent years , at least in terms of the number of calculations if not in the understanding of the scattering mechanism . a list of @xmath1 + light hadron cross section calculations is given in table i.      the most cited work , _ albeit _ furthest in its predictions from a low - energy ",
    "theoretical mean \" , is the color - dipole scattering calculation of kharzeev and satz @xcite .",
    "this reference is basically a restatement of the color - dipole model developed in the late 1970s by peskin and bhanot @xcite for scattering of light hadrons by coulombic bound states of very massive quarks . according to peskin ,",
    "the criterion for validity of this approach is  ... not met even for the @xmath26 system . \"",
    "@xcite , so there may be large systematic errors at the @xmath1 mass scale .",
    "this approach certainly makes marginal approximations for charmonium , such as the use of coulombic wavefunctions ( which are far from accurate for @xmath1 ) and the introduction of a @xmath27 binding energy ( which is hard to interpret for charmonium , and is taken to be @xmath28 by kharzeev and satz ) .",
    "these color - dipole scattering formulas also implicitly assume that charmonia are small relative to the natural qcd length scale .",
    "since potential models actually find rms @xmath1 separations of about 0.4  fm for the @xmath0 , 0.6  fm for the @xmath29 states and 0.8  fm for the @xmath15 @xcite , this is also a dubious assumption .",

    "several calculations of charmonium + light hadron cross sections have been reported assuming @xmath56-channel charmed meson exchange .",
    "of course this picture is also problematic , since the range of the exchanged charmed meson would be only about @xmath57 fm , and the assumption of nonoverlapping hadrons at this separation is clearly invalid .",
    "( this is the isgur - maltman @xcite argument as to why vector meson exchange is unjustified as the source of the short - ranged nn core interaction . )",
    "nonetheless it is again interesting to see what scale of cross section is predicted by this type of model , since it might at least incorporate the correct scales and degrees of freedom , and it assumes a different scattering mechanism from the color - dipole model advocated by kharzeev and satz .    the first such meson exchange calculation , due to matinian and mller @xcite , considered @xmath56-channel d exchange as the mechanism for the reactions @xmath58 and @xmath59 ; their results are shown in fig.4 .",

    "-0.3 cm    in summary , the current , rather unsatisfying state of affairs in meson exchange models of charmonium dissociation is that mb - scale cross sections are anticipated near threshold , but their precise values depend on poorly known hadronic form factors , as well as on effective meson lagrangians of unknown accuracy .",

    "<S> in this short review we summarize experimental information and theoretical results for the low - energy dissociation cross sections of charmonia by light hadrons . </S>",
    "<S> these cross sections are required for the simulation of charmonium absorption through collisions with comovers in heavy ion collisions , which competes with quark - gluon plasma production as a charmonium - suppression mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> if the cross sections are sufficiently large these dissociation reactions may be misinterpreted as an effect of quark - gluon plasma production . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical predictions for these rhic - related processes have used various methods , including a color - dipole scattering model , meson exchange models , constituent interchange models and qcd sum rules . </S>",
    "<S> as the results have been largely unconstrained by experiment , some of the predictions differ by orders of magnitude , notably in the near - threshold regime that is most relevant to qgp searches .    </S>"
