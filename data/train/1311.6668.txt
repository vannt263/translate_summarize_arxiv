    "<S> a _ strong edge coloring _ of a graph @xmath0 is a proper edge coloring in which each color class is an induced matching of @xmath0 . in 1993 , brualdi and quinn massey  @xcite proposed a conjecture that every bipartite graph without @xmath1-cycles and with the maximum degrees of the two partite sets @xmath2 and @xmath3 admits a strong edge coloring with at most @xmath4 colors . </S>",
    "<S> we prove that this conjecture holds for such graphs with @xmath5 . </S>",
