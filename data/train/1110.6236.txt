    "a theoretically well motivated example for _ decaying dark matter _ is the gravitino @xmath0 , which appears in locally supersymmetric extensions of the standard model . in scenarios where",
    "@xmath1-parity is mildly violated and the gravitino is the lightest superparticle ( lsp ) , thermal leptogenesis , gravitino dark matter and primordial nucleosynthesis are naturally consistent  @xcite . within this framework ,",
    "the gravitino would decay with cosmological lifetimes  @xcite , making its decay products potentially observable in the cosmic - ray fluxes  @xcite .",
    "for gravitino masses @xmath2 , the most prominent feature in the decay spectrum is an intense gamma - ray line , produced by two - body decay into neutrinos and photons , @xmath3  @xcite ; this line can be searched for in the gamma - ray fluxes observed at high latitudes . for larger",
    "gravitino masses @xmath4 , the branching ratio into gamma - ray lines is suppressed , and instead the decay modes @xmath5 and @xmath6 produce a gamma - ray flux with a broad continuous energy spectrum ; this flux could potentially show up in observations of galaxy clusters or the extragalactic gamma - ray background ( see _ e.g. _ ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    here , we briefly summarize our searches for gamma - ray signals from gravitino dark matter in the data of the fermi large area telescope ( lat )  @xcite .",

    "secondly  @xcite , we analyze the gamma - ray flux from eight galaxy clusters , targets which are more sensitive to continuous spectra . extending previous analysis  @xcite",
    ", we treat the decaying dark matter signal as extended source and analyze the different target clusters individually as well as in a combined likelihood approach .",
    "we present constraints on the dark matter lifetime as well as on the annihilation cross section .",
    "we then apply our findings to the scenario of decaying gravitino dark matter and comment on implications for the possible observation of long - lived superparticles at the lhc .",
    "the remaining sections are organized as follows : in the second section , we introduce briefly the gravitino dark matter scenario , in section three we summarize our gamma - ray line and galaxy cluster analysis , and in the fourth section we present the resulting limits on the gravitino lifetime and decay width of the next - to - lightest superparticle ( nlsp ) .",
    "among the different scenarios that were proposed to reconcile thermal leptogenesis and gravitino dark matter with the standard bbn scenario  @xcite , a mild violation of @xmath1-parity that induces a rapid decay of the nlsp before the onset of the bbn is maybe the most interesting from the perspective of indirect dark matter searches  @xcite . if @xmath1-parity is violated , the gravitino dark matter particle becomes unstable and subject to decay , which opens the possibility to look for its decay products in the cosmic - ray fluxes .",

    "trading the mass mixing parameters for @xmath1-parity breaking yukawa couplings as proposed in ref.@xcite , the gravitino decay is a function of a single dimensionless parameter @xmath9 , which also enters the decay width of the nlsp . as boundary conditions for the supersymmetry breaking parameters of the mssm at the grand unification ( gut ) scale ,",

    "electroweak precision tests ( ewpt )  @xcite , as well as the possible overproduction of gravitinos in presence of the high reheating temperatures required by standard thermal leptogenesis  @xcite , yield further bounds on the gravitino mass like @xmath18gev , and on the nlsp neutralino mass like @xmath19 ( for details see ref .",
