    "low and high luminosity radio sources appear to be very different , in fact so much so , that the fanaroff and riley classification not only stresses the morphological differences but also suggests fundamental physical differences .",
    "fri sources are much more common in the universe than friis and show much more diversity . while friis are quite homogeneous in morphology the fri class is a kind of `` mixed bag '' where one finds very different sources , which have , apart from the similar radio power , only one feature in common : hot - spots at the outer end of the lobes are never seen .",
    "3c31 with its twin jet ending in characteristc plumes has often been cited as a kind of prototype fri source , but in reality double lobed sources with jets are the rule ( fig . [ 0206 ] ): in the b2 sample of low luminosity radio galaxies 3% are of the 3c 31 type , 50 % are double lobed with ( single or double ) jets and the rest is a mixture of tailed sources ( nats and wats ) and naked jets .        naked jets ( ser e.g. fig . [ 1122 ] ) occur preferable at the low end of the power range covered by the b2 sample ( @xmath3w  hz@xmath4 ) , while at the upper end ( @xmath5  whz@xmath4 ) we find sources with an overall fr i structure but with one - sided jets and hot spots in the middle of the lobes ( fig . [ 0844 ] ) .            a characteristic feature of fr i sources is the presence of prominent twin jets that are usually very symmetrical at large scales ; however the jets tend to be very asymmetric close to the nucleus , at the jet base .",
    "this asymmetry is more pronounced in the stronger sources : the jets tend to become one - sided , more collimated , while brightness knots appear as we go to higher powers .    a recent study done by laing et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , of the side - to - side asymmetries on kiloparsec scales in the jets of fri radio galaxies selected from the b2 sample , shows that differences between the jets at a given distance from the nucleus can be interpreted as effects of doppler beaming on intrinsically symmetrical flows .",
    "the observed asymmetries are consistent with the hypothesis that the jet velocities close to the core are ( mildly ) relativistic , and that they decelerate further out .",
    "the length of the deceleration region depends on total power of the source , and ranges from @xmath6 kpc for p @xmath7  whz@xmath4 to @xmath8 10 kpc for the stronger sources .",

    "p@xmath9 is an independent orientation indicator which we expect to correlate with the brightness ratio where the flow is relativistic .",
    "this is indeed the case for the ratio at the flaring point for both powerful and weak sources ( fig .",

    "the determination of ages of extragalactic radio sources is one of the key points for any theoretical model that wants to explain the origin and evolution of radio galaxies .",
    "one of the methods for determining source ages is the study of the radio spectra , for which synchrotron theory predicts a frequency break due to the radiative energy losses , which drifts in time . according to various source evolution models , relativistic electrons in different regions of the source",
    "are deposited there at different times , so that the break frequency effectively is a clock that indicates the time elapsed since their production .    for a limited number of objects , detailed studies of the radio spectra across the emitting regions",

    "nevertheless , with some additional assumptions which find their justification from the results obtained from the well studied objects , the break frequency can be estimated with reasonable accuracy .",
    "in fact , the data available in the literature which concern a large number of powerful 3c sources are analyzed in this way ( see e.g. alexander & leahy 1987 ; leahy et al .",

    "recently a two frequency spectral study has been done of a representative subsample of b2 radio galaxies ( parma et al . , 1999 ) ; in which the radiative ageing of the relativistic electrons caused by synchrotron and inverse compton ( i.c . ) energy losses is discussed .",

    "[ sptype ] we show the behaviour of the spectral index for type 1 and type 2 sources separately        this double behaviour had already been pointed out some time ago by jgers ( 1981 ) . in the `` spectral type 2 '' sources the older electrons are found closer to the core .",
    "this class contains essentially sources with double lobed morphology , of both fr  i and fr  ii type .",

    "these are the type of objects for which @xcite have found two distinct components , a flat spectrum jet surrounded by a steeper spectrum sheath      the spectral trends along the sources are interpreted in terms of radiative ageing of the relativistic electrons by synchrotron and i.c . processes .",
    "theoretical synchrotron - loss spectra have been computed numerically ( murgia 1996 ) from the synchrotron formulae ( e.g. , pacholczyk 1970 ) .",

    "the jp model has been used since the i.c .",
    "energy losses due to the microwave background radiation are as important as the synchrotron losses , and in the former random orientations are expected between electrons and photons .",
    "the two frequency spectral index @xmath31 allows the computation of the break frequency , @xmath32 , in various regions of the source , using the synchrotron - loss spectrum for the jp model .",
    "the break frequency is used to determine a spectral age , based on the formula : @xmath33 where the synchrotron age @xmath34 is in myrs , the magnetic field b is in @xmath35 , the break frequency @xmath32 in ghz and @xmath36 @xmath35 is the equivalent magnetic field of the cosmic microwave background radiation .",
    "it is assumed that the magnetic field strength is uniform across the source and has remained constant over the source life .",

    ". therefore the two lobes were analyzed together , instead of considering them separately .",
    "this was done by folding the spectral profiles of the two lobes onto each other , after having normalized the coordinates along the lobe axis to the maximum lobe extent ( fig .",
    "[ fold ] ) .        the folded spectral index plots along the source axis were fitted with a relationship of the type : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the normalized distance from the outer lobe edge or from the core according to the observed steepening trend .",
    "the above law is expected on the basis of the relation between radiative age and break frequency , if @xmath42 is proportional to time , i.e. assuming a constant expansion speed . from it",
    "a best estimate of @xmath43 was obtained , i.e. the spectral index close to the outer edge of the lobe or close to the core , according to the observed spectral profile .",
    "this , with a few exceptions , is assumed to be equal to the injection spectral index , @xmath44 .",
    "the mean value of @xmath43 is @xmath45 , with a dispersion @xmath46 . in this way , from the folded spectral profiles , we derived the variation of the break frequency as a function of position , averaged over the two lobes .",
    "extrapolating it to the inner or outer part of the source , it is possible to obtain the `` minimum break frequency '' , @xmath47 , namely the break frequency of the oldest electrons , that we use for determination of the source age . for the large majority of the sources",
    "the extrapolation introduces only minor additional uncertainties .",
    "the computed values of @xmath47 range from a few ghz up to several tens of ghz .    considering the errors in the spectral index ( @xmath48 ) and the uncertainty in @xmath44 ( @xmath49 ) , the uncertainty in @xmath47 can be quantified as : @xmath50 this implies that only values of @xmath47 @xmath51 30 ghz are significant , which is hardly surprising given that our highest frequency is a factor six lower .",
    "the errors on @xmath34 , for a given magnetic field , are @xmath8 15 % , for break frequencies of a few ghz , increasing up to @xmath52 40 % for break frequencies @xmath8 30 ghz .",
    "had we used the kp model , @xmath34 would be shorter by @xmath8 10 @xmath53 .",
    "the radiative lifetimes are in the range of @xmath54 years .",
    "the possibility of missing source areas with steeper spectra can not be excluded .",
    "therefore the @xmath34 given are lower limits on the source ages .",
    "the distributions of radiative ages , @xmath34 , for the two spectral classes are very similar .",
    "the fits to the data in general are good , in the sense that they describe well the overall trend of @xmath28 versus @xmath42 .",
    "there are however a few objects were the break frequency does not always seem to increase with @xmath42 as expected from the simple synchrotron / i.c . model .        the saturation of @xmath28 to a constant value would indicate that the break frequency , after an initial decrease , does not decrease anymore .",
    "a possible explanation of this is that a re - acceleration process is acting , which compensates in part for the radiative energy losses and causes a freezing of the break energy at that value where the radiative and the acceleration time scales are equal .",
    "of course , if re - acceleration processes are working , the ages estimated would be underestimated . expressing the re - acceleration process as :    @xmath55    where e is the particle energy , and",

    "+ the above law naturally leads to a saturation of @xmath32 when @xmath60 .",
    "+ we have re - fitted all the spectral profiles with the above formula and derived a value of @xmath58 for each source and corresponding source age , @xmath61 , which is related to the previous one ( @xmath34 ) by : @xmath62 for at least 70% of the objects the results are not much different from the purely radiative model . for those we find",
    "@xmath63 ( the median value is 1.1 ) and the lifetimes are modified by less than a factor 2 .",
    "time scales for re - acceleration must be typically @xmath64 years .",

    "in fact , @xmath66 implies that @xmath67 . in our case",

    "these discrepancies are believed to be not very serious for at least three reasons .",
    "first of all , the one - dimensional ram - pressure balance may not be realistic and discrepancies of a factor 2 or so are well possible , as mentioned above .",
    "second , the assumed central density may be a bit too high .",
    "a value around 0.1 cm @xmath86 , which is not excluded by the x - ray data , would bring , for @xmath87 , the dynamical ages into closer agreement with the spectral ones .",
    "third , the ram - pressure dynamical ages depend on the minimum energy assumption .",
    "it has been shown that radio galaxies with luminosities like in the present sample usually have internal pressures larger than the minimum ones by a factor @xmath88 ( morganti et al .",
    "1988 ; feretti et al . 1992 ) . if the magnetic field is weaker than the one corresponding to minimum energy conditions by a factor @xmath52 4 , the internal pressure increases by a factor @xmath52 4 and the dynamical lifetime decreases by a factor @xmath8 2 .",
    "anyway , the radiative lifetimes would change little .",
    "likely both explanations may play a role in bringing @xmath34 and @xmath69 to a closer agreement .",

    "the synchrotron ages derived for the b2 sample have been compared with the corresponding ones of 3cr sources as found by alexander & leahy ( 1987 ) , leahy et al .",
    "( 1989 ) and liu et al.(1992 ) .",

    "[ age - power ] )    there are several possible reasons for these differences :    \\a ) the radiative ages derived for the powerful sources ( 3cr ) are heavily dependent on the equipartition magnetic field , @xmath90 , which is generally significantly larger than @xmath37 . for b @xmath91 the differences between the two sample would be greatly reduced .",
    "\\b ) another possibility is that , if there is significant backflow in the powerful sources , there is mixing of the old and young electrons in the inner regions , which leads to a smoothing of the spectral break and an under - estimation of the maximum radiative time scale .",
    "finally , the effect may be real , that is in low power sources like those of b2 sample , the nuclear activity lasts for a longer time .",
    "one could think of an evolutionary effect , in the sense that low power sources have evolved from high power sources and are therefore older .",
    "however , sources of b2 sample are on average smaller than powerful 3cr sources ( de ruiter et al . , 1990 )",
    "so that this explanation is unlikely in general , even if it can not be excluded as an explanation in some individual cases .",
    "another possibility is a cosmological effect , since the 3cr sources are at much larger red - shifts than b2 radio galaxies .",
    "the radiative ages thus computed are much smaller than the ages obtained from the radio luminosity function .",
    "a long time ago schmidt ( 1966 ) found for powerful radio galaxies a harmonic - mean life time of about @xmath92 years .",
    "this life time is the total time of the nuclear activity , not to be confused with the radiative loss age determined from spectral ageing arguments .",
    "the length of the active phase is related to the possibile existence of duty cycles of nuclear activity .",
    "if the nuclear activity is not continuous , how often the interruptions occur and how long do they last ?",
    "a duty cycle can be recognized as such if there is some mechanism that preserves the information of past nuclear activity for a long enough time to be recognized when a new cycle starts up . in the extended radio sources ,",
    "such a mechanism is provided for by the radio lobes .",
    "if a new phase of activity should start before these `` old '' radio lobes have faded , and if this activity manifests itself by the production of jets , we can in principle recognize this as a new , young radio source embedded in a old relic structure .",
    "of course this requires that the off time of the central activity is shorter than the fade - away time of the old radio lobes .",
    "it the off time is long enough we have the double - double radio galaxies ( ddrg ) ( schoenmakers et al . , 1999 ) , radio sources with four lobes ( fig .",
    "[ ddrg ] ) .",
    "these radio sources have been discovered by arno schoenmakers in the wenss survey and they consist of an inner double lobed radio structure as well as a larger outer double lobed structure . the inner and outer radio sources are well aligned , within 10 degrees .",
    "following the definition of schoenmakers , a ddrg consists of a pair of double radio sources with a common centre .",
    "the two lobes of the inner radio sources must have an extended , edge - brightened radio morphology .",
    "up to now four ddrg have been found in wenss survey , while three more can be founf in the literature ( 3c445 , 4c26.35 and 3c219 ) the ddrg have mpc size ( the outer components ) and the power of the outer lobes is higher than the power of the inner lobes ( @xmath93 ) ."
