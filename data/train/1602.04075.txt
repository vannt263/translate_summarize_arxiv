    "  o  2@xmath142 bands and the w  5@xmath8    o  2@xmath142 bands .",
    "it may then be of relevance that the magnetism of w  5@xmath141 electrons in an octahedral crystal field is described by a kugel - khomski hamiltonian in the limit of strong spin - orbit coupling , as described in detail by gang - chen  _ _ et al.__@xcite .",
    "this gives rise to a magnetic hamiltonian in which the exchange pathway itself depends on the orientation of the magnetic ( spin - orbital ) moments .",
    "combined with the solid orbital ordering of the magnetic cu@xmath3 @xmath21 orbital in the @xmath22 plane , perhaps the strongly spin - orbit - coupled magnetism of the w cation causes a much greater difference between @xmath25 and @xmath26 interactions .",
    "this is something that might be worth exploring in further detail .",
    "further neutron spectroscopy experiments , from which the exchange constants could be determined via spin - wave modelling , would also be beneficial but probably only if done using large single crystals which are presently not available .    with regards to the muon relaxation in the thermal spin liquid regime ,",
    "it is worth noting that compressed exponential relaxation has been observed in other spin liquid phases , for example in ( scgo )  @xcite , herbertsmithite  @xcite and the double perovskite  @xcite . in scgo",
    "the compressed exponential approaches gaussian ( @xmath143 ) as the temperature is lowered and it is thought to arise from a dynamical and heterogeneous ground state with a mixture of unpaired spins and spins paired into spin - singlet dimers  @xcite , so that any particular muon environment fluctuates between magnetic and non - magnetic at a time scale shorter than the muon lifetime .",
    "this inevitably gives rise to a lifetime faster than that observed for the other examples and in there is no evidence of spin - singlet dimers , as they would be manifest in neutron spectroscopy data as near - neighbour antiferromagnetic correlations only .",
    "this also rules out any fundamental similarity with the spin liquid states in herbertsmithite and as both states are thought to be dominated by near - neighbour spin - singlet  @xcite and spin - orbital singlet dimers  @xcite , respectively . in the compressed exponential muon relaxation",
    "is the result of two distinct muon environments : those adjacent to unpaired ( dangling ) fluctuating spins and those sitting elsewhere in the material , surrounded by non - magnetic spin - orbital singlet pairs .",
    "hence there is a rather large variety of scenarios that give rise to compressed exponential relaxation and they have to be considered case by case .",
    "no further parallels can be drawn between the case of and the others .",
    "below 24  k the quasi-2d square lattice antiferromagnet freezes into a 3d - ordered nel state with k - vector @xmath92 , pointing to type-2 antiferromagnetic order ( magnetic space group @xmath144 ) as predicted previously based on x - ray absorption spectroscopy combined with computational studies  @xcite . as often for quasi-2d antiferromagnets with @xmath5 , neutron spectroscopy shows that dynamic 2d correlations are detectable far above @xmath7 ; in this case up to @xmath126  k , a temperature that is comparable to the energy scale of the main exchange interaction estimated at @xmath145  k and coinciding with the maximum in the magnetic susceptibility .",
    "furthermore , @xmath27sr shows a pronounced slowing down taking place well before @xmath7 is reached on cooling .",
    "the pronounced 2d character of the magnetism is however surprising in the light of the exchange constants one might expect considering the structure of .",
    "perhaps the spin - orbit coupling in the 5@xmath141 band of the w cations on the dominant exchange interaction pathway , not taken into account in the reported calculations  @xcite , can explain the large difference between in - plane and out - of - plane exchange interactions implied by the above observations .",
