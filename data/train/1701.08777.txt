    "the classification of quantum field theories ( qfts ) is an old and important problem .",
    "this subject is riddled with subtleties : not only is there no satisfying rigorous definition of many quantum theories , but even the more lax physical approach  specifying field content and an action or a hamiltonian  is not free of shortcomings .",
    "on the one hand , there seem to exist perfectly acceptable qfts without a known action ; on the other hand , theories with different field content and actions can turn out to be dual to each other , thereby really representing the same theory .    the renormalization group ( rg ) procedure is an extremely important conceptual beacon that has shed much light upon the structure of the space of possible theories .",
    "rg systematically zooms into the long - distance degrees of freedom of a given theory , and so it defines a monotonic flow on the space of local qfts .",
    "fixed points of this flow possess conformal symmetry , and this provides a great degree of control over them .",
    "one can typically understand many relevant questions about a given qft by identifying the conformal theory ( cft ) it flows to under rg . in this sense , cfts represent a useful set of universality classes that chart the set of qfts on which rg can be defined .    unfortunately , not every conceivable theory admits a useful wilsonian rg procedure .",
    "the key assumptions behind the rg paradigm include a tensor product structure of the hilbert space and a sufficient locality of the hamiltonian . in the absence of a product structure , for instance in a @xmath2-dimensional spacetime ,",
    "the notion of coarse - graining the short - distance degrees of freedom no longer applies .",
    "moreover , even in the presence of such a product structure , a sufficiently nasty hamiltonian ( say , one that couples all degrees of freedom to each other ) can render the procedure meaningless .",
    "these issues have been brought to the fore by the recent surge of interest in the syk model , a ( mostly ) solvable quantum - mechanical theory without a concept of locality but with an alluring similarity to a quantum gravity theory @xcite .",
    "a renewed interest in quantum chaos and its connections to quantum gravity emerged just before the advent of the syk model @xcite .",
    "indeed , it was the similarity of scrambling in black holes and in syk that first drew attention to this model .",
    "quantum chaos deals with typical long - time behavior of a quantum system , mirroring the study of sensitive dependence on initial conditions that underpins the field of classical chaos @xcite .",
    "alternatively , quantum chaos can be seen as a field that studies general properties of the entire spectrum of quantum theories . as such",
    ", it can be contrasted to the rg approach outlined above , which is always oriented to studying a particular low - energy ( or scale - independent ) part of the spectrum of a given qft .",
    "intriguingly , quantum chaos brings forth a different kind of universality : quantizing most classically chaotic systems gives spectra much like those of random matrices drawn from one of the standard gaussian ensembles , with eigenvalues exhibiting wigner - dyson statistics @xcite .",
    "conversely , quantizing many classically integrable systems produces hamiltonians whose eigenvalue gaps have poisson statistics @xcite .",
    "there exists a rich mathematical literature on this subject , and the origin of this universality is in some cases well understood  particularly in systems with semiclassical limits @xcite ( see @xcite for recent physics developments ) and in wide classes of non - gaussian random matrices ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .    despite the lack of a natural flow on the space of theories , it is still possible to further our understanding of how quantum theories organize themselves into equivalence classes based on their spectral behavior",
    "this is primarily due to the relative simplicity of this `` landscape , '' as compared to the situation one finds in the study of rg fixed points .",
    "all evidence shows that there exist two extremal regimes  quantum ergodicity ( random - matrix - like behavior ) and localization ( integrable - system - like behavior ) .",
    "other regimes appear to be mixes or crossovers between the two , where one part of the spectrum is ergodic while the other one is integrable . in general",
    ", we can expect ten different classes of quantum ergodicity , depending on which discrete symmetries ( time reversal , orientation reversal , and charge conjugation ) are present or broken in the theory @xcite ; the three classes that are most frequently encountered are the gaussian ensembles , goe , gue , and gse . on the other hand , each localized regime",
    "is governed by the particular set of symmetries present in the system .",
    "crossovers between these regimes may also be marked by a third , critical regime with power - law localized , self - similar wavefunctions @xcite , but we currently know very little about when this phenomenon generally appears .",
    "the goal of this paper is to coarsely chart this ergodicity landscape of quantum theories . while we do not possess a prescription as convenient and appealing as rg , we use a combination of numerical results and analytic arguments to describe what can be found in this landscape .",
    "the main takeaway point is that the more structure ( regularity , symmetry ) is present in the theory , the less like a random matrix it will behave . while this may sound simple , in practice it can be subtle to identify what kind of regularity destroys quantum ergodicity . for instance , it is not immediately obvious that a sparse @xmath3 matrix with @xmath4 entries drawn from a bernoulli distribution is ergodic , while a dense matrix whose each entry is drawn from a cauchy ( breit - wigner ) distribution is not ergodic .",
    "we will establish useful definitions of ergodicity and plausible regularity criteria that separate ergodic hamiltonians from the nonergodic ones .",
    "the ideas we present here stem from various fields  high energy physics , condensed matter physics , and random matrix theory  and we have attempted to make the presentation accessible to members of all of these communities . in particular , we have strived to make this paper as self - contained as possible , and all models are presented from a unified point of view .",
    "section [ sec rgqc ] covers physical ideas about operators and coarse - graining that provide a universal way to view all theories , while section [ sec review ] synthesizes known rigorous and numerical results on ergodic properties of many theories .",
    "in the rest of the current section we will present a short summary of ideas needed to understand our results , so readers may choose to skim either ( or both ) of sections [ sec rgqc ] and [ sec review ] and to focus on results in section [ sec chart ] .",
    "we take quantum ergodicity to mean that , in an admissible basis ( to be defined in section [ subsec ops ] ) , eigenstates of the hamiltonian have the same statistics as a set of uniformly random vectors with unit norm . a set like",
    "this is almost surely provided by eigenvectors of random self - adjoint matrices drawn from gaussian ensembles . to measure this randomness of eigenstates , we coarse - grain the theory from a full quantum algebra down to a classical algebra of observables and calculate the von neumann entropies of the reduced density matrices that eigenstates reduce to .",
    "when the classical observables at the end of our coarse - graining are position operators , we recover entropic delocalization measures present in much of the quantum chaos literature , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "we do _ not _ use eigenvalue statistics as a proxy for quantum ergodicity .",
    "one reason is that this kind of diagnostic is overly sensitive to symmetries of the original system ; systems with conserved local operators will only show the appropriate random matrix spectra within the corresponding superselection sectors , and these may be difficult to identify .",
    "another reason is that eigenvalues can also diagnose quantum ergodicity when none is present , as in the case of certain metric graphs @xcite .",
    "we will see a few more examples of this dissonance between eigenvalue statistics and ergodicity in models of spin chains or fermions .",
    "the structure that controls ergodicity is most clearly seen by focusing on hamiltonians that are adjacency matrices of various connected graphs .",
    "these hamiltonians are symmetric matrices with entries 0 or 1 that describe motion on the vertices of the graph ; the graph edges correspond to hoppings enacted by the operators in the hamiltonian .",
    "the symmetries of the underlying graph determine the ergodicity properties of the theory .",
    "sufficiently small perturbations of the hamiltonian away from the canonical adjacency matrix form are found not to strongly influence ergodicity , while @xmath5 perturbations that are not highly symmetric always increase the ergodicity of the theory .",
    "sufficiently strong perturbations , on the other hand , always lead to localized theories . the critical perturbation strength needed to transition between regimes is a function of the system size and is , in general , very difficult to determine in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we will instead use many examples to analyze how ergodicity at finite system size varies across the space of all theories .    in more detail",
    ", this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec rgqc ]",
    "we discuss operator algebras and their basis choices in general quantum theories .",
    "these algebraic methods provide a useful conceptual way to think of all theories on the same footing . by studying natural reductions of operator algebras ,",
    "we clarify why the usual wilsonian rg is not a good tool to use in order to understand quantum chaos in many quantum systems , and we define the entropy of reduced algebras as a tool that can be used to quantify the information lost in a given state upon algebraic coarse - graining .    in section [ sec review ] we provide a brief status report on the current understanding of ergodic universality in many special cases .",
    "we are necessarily restricted to low - dimensional theories in which the entire spectrum is known . within this class ,",
    "we examine many one - particle quantum mechanics problems , including the typical examples of particles moving in flat and hyperbolic billiards .",
    "we also review particles moving on discrete spaces , random hamiltonians of the wigner type , and one - dimensional spin chains , including the syk model as a special case .",
    "we diagnose ergodicity in all these models by numerically obtaining the entire spectrum and computing the distribution of coarse - grained entropies of states in the spectrum .    in section [ sec chart ]",
    "we bring together all these special cases and a provide more in - depth analysis of their features . using our knowledge of how ergodicity changes with perturbations of these models , we draw a sketch of the _ ergodic landscape _ in the space of all quantum theories with a fixed hilbert space dimension .",
    "our findings can be understood by invoking ordinary perturbation theory of quantum mechanics , which allows us express the eigenstate coefficients as a sum over trajectories on the appropriate graphs ; we conjecture how the lack of structure or overly strong interactions can lead to ergodicity via a central limit theorem .    as a particular application of these ideas , in section [ subsec syk ]",
    "we focus on syk and related models .",
    "we show that , in the standard spin basis and for up to @xmath6 majorana fermions , the eigenstates of the standard @xmath7 syk are maximally ergodic within their appropriate parity sectors , in keeping with the theoretical expectations in the @xmath8 regime .",
    "we also report on the loss of ergodicity in the presence of weak disorder , and we compare this behavior to ergodic ising chains and disordered random graphs .",
    "consider a quantum theory with a @xmath9-dimensional hilbert space .",
    "the algebra of all quantum operators is the vector space of @xmath10 complex matrices , and the set of all theories with this hilbert space is the subset of hermitian operators of this algebra .",
    "it is very covenient to specify the complete orthonormal basis of the operator algebra via a _ group _ of operators .",
    "we choose this group such that for any two of its elements @xmath11 and @xmath12 we have @xmath13 .",
    "a simple and always definable group with such properties is generated by the position and shift generators @xmath14 and @xmath15 satisfying @xmath16 and @xmath17 .    whenever @xmath9 is not prime , the hilbert space is isomorphic to a tensor product of spaces of different dimensions @xmath18 , with @xmath19 . in quantum field theories ,",
    "one typically deals with @xmath20 identical hilbert spaces of dimension @xmath21 such that @xmath22 .",
    "then it is possible to consider a different set of generators , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , which satisfy @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 for @xmath28 .",
    "as they generate the same algebra , the generators @xmath29 and @xmath30 are _ dual _ to each other .",
    "a typical example to keep in mind is the ising model with @xmath20 spins .",
    "here we have @xmath31 , and the generators @xmath23 , @xmath24 at each site @xmath32 are isomorphic to the pauli matrices @xmath33 , @xmath34 . for a general @xmath21 , @xmath23 and",
    "@xmath24 are interpreted as position and momentum ( `` clock '' and `` shift '' ) operators for a particle moving on an @xmath20-torus of length @xmath21 .",
    "any state in the hilbert space can be represented as a density matrix belonging to the algebra of operators on that space . for any basis @xmath35 of operators ,",
    "this matrix is here @xmath36 denotes the expectation value of @xmath37 in the given state .",
    "this compact formula is one of the many reasons why it is convenient to use a group as a basis for the quantum algebra .",
    "the final ingredient needed to specify a theory is a hamiltonian @xmath38 .",
    "once it is given , one can meaningfully discuss the dimensionality of the space on which the theory lives .",
    "if @xmath39 , we can label each site @xmath32 with @xmath40 separate indices @xmath41 , each running from 1 to @xmath42 .",
    "this labeling is reasonable only if the hamiltonian is appropriately local , i.e.  if it is a linear combination of basis operators @xmath43 , where for each term the mutual distance of indices @xmath32 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , etc .  on the @xmath40-dimensional lattice",
    "is of order one .",
    "( it goes without saying that we will always be imagining large systems , with @xmath46 .",
    ") dualities between operator algebras are really only useful when they preserve the locality of the hamiltonian .",
    "nevertheless , we emphasize that _ any _ theory can be dualized to a single particle hopping between @xmath9 sites in some possibly very irregular way , with an algebra generated by a single pair of operators @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the point of view presented here is very traditional .",
    "there is reason to believe that not all ingredients specified above are necessary to define a satisfactory quantum theory .",
    "for instance , we need nt have started with a hilbert space  specifying one state , or one set of expectation values @xmath47 , is enough to reconstruct the rest through the gns construction , modulo some subtleties @xcite .",
    "similarly , the hamiltonian need not be explicitly known  it may be sufficient to specify a symmetry principle which , along with a few parameters , fixes the whole time evolution , like it is done in many conformal theories without a known action @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in this paper we will assume that the hamiltonian and hilbert space are explicitly known .",
    "as we view the operator algebra as the central object in a quantum theory , we should note that not all @xmath3 matrices are necessary to define a theory  it is sometimes possible to consistently project down to a subset of the operator algebra , as done in gauge or orbifold theories .",
    "moreover , as @xmath48 this question leads to the vast field of subfactor theory @xcite .",
    "we will not discuss such issues here .",
    "rather , we will tackle a different but related question : what can be learned about a theory from a subalgebra of its operators ?    in general",
    ", given a state @xmath49 and a subalgebra @xmath50 of the original algebra @xmath51 , one can construct the reduced density matrix where @xmath52 is the group whose elements form the basis of @xmath50 .",
    "this is merely a projection of the original density matrix to the chosen set of basis operators .",
    "it can be checked that this is the unique matrix that satisfies the condition @xmath53 for all @xmath54 ( and , by linearity , for all @xmath55 ) .",
    "two major areas of research analyze these reduced density matrices in different contexts , though neither were initially defined from this operator perspective :    1 .",
    "algebras supported on spatial subregions lead to many useful characterizations of a quantum state , such as the entanglement entropy and its cousins ( renyi entropies , relative entropy with respect to a fiducial state , etc ) .",
    "most of these parameters can be computed for an arbitrary subalgebra and state , but they are of greatest utility in local theories at @xmath56 , as there they can be used to detect the structure of spatial entanglement between different degrees of freedom in the given state . a related question is whether typical eigenstates in a theory reduce to thermal density matrices when restricted to a sufficiently small region .",
    "this behavior , _ eigenstate thermalization _",
    ", is a consequence of quantum ergodicity @xcite .",
    "renormalization group techniques provide complementary insight : instead of zooming into a spatial subregion , rg uniformly coarse - grains the operator algebra throughout the entire space . for a typical state in a generic theory",
    ", doing this just gives another reduced density matrix for which the various entropies could be computed .",
    "for a local theory and in the lowest states in the energy spectrum , however , rg usually does much more : it leads to a pure reduced density matrix .",
    "this is because typical low - lying states will also have very low spatial momentum , so an effective hamiltonian description may hold in the coarse - grained picture .",
    "the resulting rg flow on the space of hamiltonians leads to the great benefits outlined in the introduction .",
    "it is important to stress that rg does not lead to an effective quantum theory without the slow spatial variation in the given state .",
    "if this assumption is violated , any state will become mixed after coarse - graining , and therefore its evolution will not be unitary .",
    "also , note that the product structure of the hilbert space is crucial here : in a general quantum problem without this structure , there is no reason to expect a coarse - grained effective theory for _ any _ state .",
    "of course , a decimation of a general quantum algebra can always be performed .",
    "for instance , if @xmath9 is even , the set of generators @xmath30 can be replaced with @xmath57 , and this will yield a new , smaller algebra .",
    "is even , we can choose a basis generated by two operators , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , such that @xmath60 .",
    "then the coarse - graining described above would correspond to removing all basis operators that contain @xmath58 .",
    "this is not equivalent to a `` tracing out '' of degrees of freedom associated to the index 1 ; to do this we would have to remove the generator @xmath61 , too . ] of particular interest are abelian algebras of quantum operators , e.g.  the ones generated only by @xmath15 or by @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the entropies associated to these abelian algebras play a very useful role in diagnosing quantum ergodicity .      as mentioned in the introduction , studying quantum chaos requires analyzing the entire spectrum , not just the eigenstates for which rg works  if any even exist .",
    "the signature of chaos we will look for is the randomness of energy eigenstates .",
    "more precisely , we want to know whether for @xmath62 every eigenstate looks like a set of @xmath9 random variables drawn from a distribution that , as @xmath48 , tends to a gaussian centered at @xmath63 and with variance that vanishes with @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "( at finite @xmath9 , the overall constraint on the coefficients to have unit norm causes deviations from gaussianity @xcite . ) said another way , we wish to know if the eigenstates behave like random matrix eigenvectors @xcite . this behavior is to be contrasted to eigenstates being sharply localized ( as found in anderson- or many - body - localized systems ) or to having uniformly delocalized states with all entries equal to @xmath63 with exponentially small corrections ( as found in free theories ) .",
    "this criterion is only meaningful if there exists a preferred basis of states with respect to which the eigenstate entries are supposed to look random .",
    "the existing literature has almost exclusively used the position basis for this purpose , and all the results stated in the previous paragraph were assuming this choice .",
    "the point of view of this paper is that we can use the eigenbasis of any operator with nondegenerate , uniformly distributed eigenvalues .",
    "the position basis , furnished in the most general case by a single operator @xmath14 represented as a diagonal matrix with entries @xmath64 , is of course an example of such a tame basis .",
    "we will discuss other admissible bases in section [ subsec ops ] .    given a reference eigenbasis @xmath65 of an appropriate operator @xmath37 ,",
    "what remains is to find a useful diagnostic of randomness for each state .",
    "two particularly natural ones are the distributions of inverse participation ratios ( ipr ) and infrared ( ir ) entropies across the spectrum . given an energy eigenstate @xmath66 , the ipr is defined as and the ir entropy is the latter quantity is called the infrared entropy following @xcite , where it was shown to be the natural characterization of the eigenstate s reduced density matrix that is obtained by coarse - graining the full operator algebra down to the abelian algebra generated by @xmath37 . as a successful diagnostic of quantum ergodicity ,",
    "however , it has appeared in multiple previous studies , e.g.  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will typically use its normalized exponential , which we will call the _ ir diversity _ , note that the ipr can be understood as the exponential of the second rnyi entropy .",
    "there exist many other possible diagnostics .",
    "for instance , one may ask for the distribution of @xmath67 norms or nodal or level sets of eigenstates , but we will not use these in this work .    studying the statistics of eigenstate coefficients",
    "is sensible if the dimension of the hilbert space is large enough .",
    "perhaps less obviously , though , prematurely taking the thermodynamic limit @xmath48 may make quantum ergodicity much harder to study .",
    "this is not surprising : if @xmath9 is strictly infinite , the system will not explore its whole phase space in finite time , and many hallmarks of quantum chaos will be much harder ( or impossible ) to detect . typically ,",
    "if we consider a particle moving on a smooth manifold and ask for eigenstates @xmath68 of the corresponding laplacian , studying quantum ergodicity amounts to proving that @xmath69 weakly converges to the volume form on the manifold or that matrix elements of observables converge to their thermodynamic averages , and then one needs to appeal to results from classical ergodic theory to show that in these cases delocalization is random as opposed to uniform .",
    "there are several other diagnostics ; for a review see @xcite .",
    "we will work at finite @xmath9 and will be able to clearly see the characteristic @xmath9-dependence of the ir diversity in the ergodic regime as @xmath9 is increased .",
    "in this paper we focus on hamiltonians with real entries , with the syk model being the only exception .",
    "fully ergodic real hamiltonians have the same spectral properties as matrices drawn from the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) @xcite .",
    "recall that for goe matrices each off - diagonal entry is independently drawn from a gaussian of zero mean and unit variance , and each on - diagonal entry is independently drawn from a gaussian of zero mean and variance two .     of eigenvectors of random matrices from the goe and gue ensembles .",
    "the characteristic gaussian distribution around @xmath70 and @xmath71 is clearly visible .",
    "we present aggregated results for 2000 instances of @xmath72 matrices drawn from each ensemble.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    in all systems with real eigenvectors that we have studied , a fully nonergodic theory will produce a sharp peak in the distribution of position basis ir diversities near @xmath73 ( for localized theories ) or near @xmath74 ( for free theories , which are localized in momentum space ) .",
    "this is to be contrasted with ergodic theories , where in position basis we find that , as @xmath9 tends to infinity , the distribution of ir diversities asymptotes to a gaussian centered around @xmath75 with variance @xmath76 .",
    "( here @xmath77 is the euler - mascheroni constant . )",
    "the latter is , unsurprisingly , also the kind of distribution expected for eigenvectors of goe matrices , see fig .",
    "[ fig rmt]@xcite .",
    "all other real - valued hamiltonians can be seen as interpolating between these two extremes .",
    "systems with complex eigenvectors in a ( real ) position basis come with an additional quirk : the real and imaginary parts of each component are effectively independent random variables .",
    "the norm @xmath78 of each eigenvector coefficient is now a sum of squares of two gaussian random variables , and as a result the ir diversity distribution is centered around @xmath71 .",
    "this result is found for eigenvectors of gaussian symplectic and unitary matrices .",
    "it is also recovered for eigenvectors of goe matrices when entropies are computed in the momentum basis .",
    "symmetries can constrain eigenvector coefficients and affect the ir entropies / diversities . in many examples",
    "the presence of a @xmath79 parity or reflection symmetry will restrict the ir diversity to @xmath80 .",
    "we remind the reader that this restriction is the property of the basis ( or of the ir algebra ) , which is chosen on physical grounds as explained in [ subsec ops ] . in the presence of degeneracies ,",
    "the choice of basis must be supplemented with a choice of polarization in the degenerate subspace .    finally ,",
    "while we do not diagnose ergodicity using eigenvalue gap statistics , we still compute it in all models we study , and we find good agreement with previous studies . instead of looking directly at eigenvalue gaps ,",
    "we look at the statistics of the @xmath81-parameter @xcite .",
    "let @xmath82 be an ordered set of energy levels of a hamiltonian , and @xmath83 the nearest - neighbor spacings .",
    "the @xmath81-parameter is defined as and it takes values in [ 0,1 ] .    for hamiltonians with poisson - distributed gaps ,",
    "the @xmath81-distribution is @xmath84 . for hamiltonians with wigner - dyson gap statistics ,",
    "a wigner - like surmise for @xmath85 @xcite is where @xmath86 is the dyson index equal to 1 ( goe ) , 2 ( gue ) , or 4 ( gse ) .",
    "the normalization is @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 for @xmath90 , respectively .",
    "eigenvalue repulsion is captured in the fact that the @xmath85 vanishes for small @xmath81 in a distinctive fashion , @xmath91 , depending on the three wigner - dyson classes .",
    "we start from the simplest possible setting : a single particle moving on a one - dimensional target space , say @xmath92 .",
    "no product structure of the hilbert space is assumed , and @xmath9 can also be prime .",
    "the basis of the operator algebra is generated by two operators , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , whose eigenvalues are the first @xmath9 powers of @xmath93 .",
    "the free hamiltonian is this theory is , of course , easily solvable , and the eigenstates are readily found to all have zero ir entropy in the momentum basis .",
    "they are completely localized in momentum space .",
    "the same holds for less local hoppings described by higher powers of @xmath15 ( without any @xmath14 s ) .",
    "the next simplest theory is a perturbed free particle of the form the potential can be any function with @xmath5 coefficients , for instance @xmath94 for some @xmath95 .",
    "we wish to highlight the following facts :    1 .",
    "the standard continuum limit is reached when @xmath96 for @xmath97 . in that regime",
    ", one can expand @xmath98 in powers of @xmath99 and , after rescaling the hamiltonian , get @xmath100 .",
    "this approximation fails for highly excited states .",
    "if @xmath101 , the ergodicity properties will be the same as in the free theory .",
    "when @xmath102 , at least some states will localize in position space .",
    "the nature of this crossover depends on the potential . for very smooth potentials such as @xmath103 ,",
    "full localization happens only when @xmath104 .",
    "these effects are invisible in the continuum limit , where @xmath105 is of order @xmath106 ; however , dialing @xmath107 does show signs of localization in the lowest - lying states .",

    "consider the disordered background @xmath108 with random numbers @xmath109 of unit variance .",

    "let us consider one such hamiltonian , this describes a free particle whose motion on each link is modulated by some random , link - dependent noise .",
    "we choose each @xmath109 to be a gaussian with mean one and variance @xmath105 .",
    "just as with the particle in a random potential , the eigenstates start becoming delocalized when @xmath102 .",
    "unlike that theory , however , here dialing @xmath105 until it is @xmath5 does something novel : it effectively prohibits hopping between some randomly selected pairs of sites .",
    "this splits the target space into multiple disconnected components .",
    "further increasing @xmath105 causes more splittings to happen , as any @xmath129 much smaller than the maximal one becomes a negligible term in the hamiltonian .",
    "we thus reach a theory where , in effect , a sizeable portion of links was chosen at random and diluted .",
    "this kind of modulation of hopping elements is very different for quantum mechanics in higher dimensions . instead of trivially localizing the theory ,",
    "this dilution of links gives rise to ergodicity .",
    "indeed , we will see in section [ subsec syk ] that this effect is necessary in order to understand the ergodic behavior of the syk model .",
    "another fact of interest is that if @xmath109 are drawn from a rademacher distribution , with each @xmath109 taking values @xmath130 with probability @xmath131 , there is essentially no effect on quantum ergodicity .",
    "thus , instead of having taken @xmath109 to be gaussian random , we could have taken them to be absolute values of gaussian random variables , and our conclusions would have been unaltered .    we have now seen that restricting hopping between sites ruins the momentum space localization of free theory eigenstates .",
    "one may then ask whether it is possible to add more hopping terms so that :    1 .",
    "the problem remains that of a particle moving in one dimension ( i.e.  the number of nonzero terms above the diagonal in the hamiltonian never deviates from @xmath9 by more than @xmath5 ) ; 2 .",
    "momentum space localization stays ruined ; 3 .",
    "the region remains connected , and thereby position space localization is prevented .",
    "this leads us to the study of _ metric graphs _ @xcite . as an example , consider a particle moving on the edges of a tetrahedron .",
    "this problem is essentially the same as a free particle moving on a circle : the only modification is that at a few points ( the tetrahedron vertices ) the incoming wavepacket can now split into multiple wavepackets .",
    "there exists a wealth of graphs and boundary conditions that can be studied , and this subject is well - researched . in particular , it was found that graphs lacking any accidental symmetries  such as a tetrahedron or star graph with incommensurate edges  show random matrix eigenvalue statistics but _ not _ quantum ergodicity @xcite .",
    "when the semiclassical limit is applicable , this phenomenon can be understood in terms of summing short classical orbits @xcite , and a similar ( though fully quantum and more schematic ) understanding will be offered in this paper .",
    "the conclusion is that satisfying all three criteria is essentially impossible : to achieve full quantum ergodicity , one needs to consider hamiltonians with significantly more that @xmath9 hopping elements ( e.g.  @xmath132 ) .",
    "these correspond to particles moving in more than one dimension .",
    "this is the quantum analog of the statement that there is no classical chaos in one dimension .",
    "let us now inject the smallest amount of product structure into the hilbert space : we consider the quantum particle moving in two dimensions .",
    "the algebra is generated by two position and momentum operators , and an appropriate local hamiltonian is this is a particle moving on a torus .",
    "the situation is similar to the one in one dimension .",
    "for smooth potentials , @xmath105 may need to be dialed as far as @xmath104 for the entire spectrum to get localized . on the other hand , for random potentials",
    ", we again have anderson localization for any @xmath105 , with the caveat that as the coupling goes to zero the localization length diverges as @xmath133 , rendering all states delocalized at any finite system size @xcite .",
    "localization at arbitrary coupling is no longer possible in higher dimensions .",
    "the problem of random hoppings between lattice sites is much more interesting now than in one dimension .",
    "it is also well - studied and goes by the name of _ quantum percolation _ or _ off - diagonal disorder _ @xcite .",
    "off - diagonal disorder effectively dilutes ( or even removes ) some links from a regular @xmath40-dimensional grid .",
    "a quantum percolation transition is observed as the disorder strength varies .",
    "once a critical percentage of links is removed , all states become localized in position space ; below this value , states are extended , though not necessarily ergodic  depending on the potential , they can be localized in momentum space .",
    "the critical link density is dimension - dependent .",
    "for @xmath134 it is equal to unity , which means that for a particle moving on a two - dimensional manifold , any nonzero density of hopping defects leads to complete position space localization of the spectrum . for higher dimensions @xmath40 , the critical link density decreases ,",
    "so for @xmath135 the spectrum is in general delocalized and possibly ergodic .",
    "the famous stadium problems @xcite that have long been archetypes of quantum chaos ( see fig .  [ fig stadium ] ) can also be accessed as special cases of weighted hoppings on a torus . here , instead of randomly distributing the hopping weights , we choose to purposefully remove links ( assign them weight zero ) so that the particle starts feeling an impenetrable obstacle whose macroscopic shape corresponds to the classical boundaries of the billiard .",
    "a similar approach was taken in @xcite , where @xmath136-function obstacles were placed on sites to mimic boundaries . even without any randomness and with very few links removed , these link deletions profoundly alter the spectrum and bring it very close to that of a random matrix ( fig .",
    "[ fig stadium ent ] ) .",
    "it is a feature of many flat stadii that a sparse set of eigenstates remains localized ; these are the famous quantum scars @xcite .",
    "we now move from flat manifolds with obstacles to curved manifolds .",
    "most relevant results here are formulated directly in the continuum .",
    "positively curved manifolds have received comparatively little attention in the quantum chaos literature .",
    "the motion of a particle on a two - sphere , while integrable , has a large number of degeneracies that make the usage of eigenvector statistics ill - defined ; nevertheless , a randomly chosen set of eigenstates is known to be ergodic @xcite .",
    "this shows that the notion of quantum ergodicity in systems with many symmetries can be quite subtle .",
    "particles moving freely on negatively curved two - manifolds are poster children of quantum chaos  perhaps even more so than billiards .",
    "laplacians on generic hyperbolic manifolds are expected to have strongly ergodic spectra .",
    "this statement is made precise by the quantum unique ergodicity ( que ) conjecture , which posits that hyperbolic surfaces have no quantum scars and that _ all _ eigenstates are ergodic @xcite .",
    "perhaps ironically , the one set of manifolds for which que has been rigorously established is the set of _ arithmetic billiards _",
    "@xcite , for which eigenvalue statistics is known to be that of integrable systems @xcite .",
    "this happens because the manifolds in question are quotients of the hyperbolic plane by subgroups of the modular group , leaving a large number of symmetries present in the system  without making the theory integrable .",
    "finally , good expander graphs can be seen as discrete versions of hyperbolic manifolds .",
    "examples of special importance here are regular graphs , which have an equal number of links emanating from each vertex .",
    "note that these examples all involve a particle hopping from one vertex of a graph to another , with links representing hopping terms in the hamiltonian .",
    "this is not the same situation as with metric graphs in the previous section , where the majority of possible positions were _ within _ the links .",
    "quantum mechanics on random regular graphs is known to be ergodic @xcite . on the other hand , for highly symmetric regular graphs ,",
    "e.g.  for the edges of a hypercubic lattice , the dynamics is integrable .",
    "the results presented so far were based on exact diagonalization of various hamiltonians and on model - specific analytic arguments .",
    "it is natural to ask whether an all - purpose perturbative approach may help us understand these results .",
    "certainly , one can consider an exactly solvable hamiltonian and develop perturbation theory in @xmath105 around it .",
    "however , small perturbations of integrable systems typically do not lead to a fully ergodic phase .",
    "the alternative is to study chaos by expanding in @xmath114 while leaving @xmath105 arbitrary ( even of the order of @xmath9 ) .",
    "this is the semiclassical limit .    for a classical limit to apply",
    ", it is not enough to have a particle hopping on a large graph ; some regularity is necessary , such as translation invariance . a free particle hopping on a circle or a torus naturally admits a classical limit , as do slow - varying perturbations thereof . a particle hopping on a metric graph _",
    "almost _ admits a classical limit : it moves classically on each link , but encounters a singularity at a vertex .",
    "this is why the classical limit of a metric graph problem is always a random walk between the vertices of that graph @xcite .",
    "a particle hopping on a torus with a singularity in the form of a @xmath136-function admits a classical limit as a particle moving on a torus with an obstacle with dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "a particle hopping on a graph that uniformly expands in all directions admits a classical limit of a particle on a hyperbolic manifold . in all these cases ,",
    "semiclassical methods ( systematically including long - time / finite - size effects in the form of @xmath114 corrections ) provide powerful tools for understanding chaos .",
    "the essence of semiclassicality is the use of _ trace formulae _ ,",
    "which relate the density of states to path integral problems that admit a saddle - point approach @xcite . to briefly summarize this philosophy",
    ", one expresses the density of states as the trace in this formula can now be expressed as a path integral over all periodic trajectories of period @xmath137 .",
    "classically , this path integral is dominated by the sum over classical orbits ( with the appropriate boundary conditions at obstacles or graph vertices , as required ) .",
    "thus the density @xmath138 is given by a the fourier transform in @xmath137 of the sum over all periodic orbits of length @xmath137 .",
    "for many chaotic systems , the number of states in a window @xmath139 is known to look like the one found in gaussian ensembles even at relatively small scales ( e.g.  at @xmath140 ) @xcite . in order to access local eigenvalue statistics at microscopic scales @xmath141 ,",
    "it is necessary to study correlations of the type @xmath142 averaged over a large window of energies @xmath143 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . a careful semiclassical analysis ( on an arbitrary classically chaotic manifold )",
    "can then account for finite @xmath9 effects due to nearby periodic orbits and give spectral correlators that agree with those from random matrix theory @xcite .",
    "moreover , the sums of periodic orbits can be shown to be generated by an effective matrix model , thereby providing a link to random matrix theory @xcite .",
    "a similar story exists for metric graphs , where random matrix theory is accessed through counting graph cycles of a given length @xcite .",
    "these semiclassical methods show that spectral statistics no longer agrees with the random matrix one once there is a lot of structure in the sum over periodic orbits .",
    "the simplest example , of course , comes from applying the trace formula to the free theory of a particle on a torus @xcite .",
    "more intricate examples come from the arithmetic billiards mentioned above .",
    "similarly , spectral universality fails for metric graph problems when graphs have commensurate edges , as this leads to extra structure in the sum over cycles .",
    "what happens in all these examples is simple to state but difficult to prove in a robust way : the proliferation of incommensurate periodic orbits means that the phases that enter trace formulae are independent random phases , and a form of central limit theorem ensures that their sum has a universal distribution . if there is a lot of structure to the problem , the phases entering the trace formulae are no longer independent , and the central limit theorem fails .",
    "this is the thought that motivates us to investigate how having a lot of structure hidden in a hamiltonian leads to the failure of ergodicity , even when semiclassical methods do not apply .",
    "having exhausted semiclassical methods in simple quantum mechanical problems , let us now step back and examine what is known about quantum ergodicity in random matrix theory .",
    "a good survey of recent results is @xcite .",
    "we will pay some extra attention to results obtained for sparse random matrices , as these are the ones that most closely correspond to physical hamiltonians .",
    "as before , we focus on real - valued matrices that are expected to be in the universality class of gaussian orthogonal ensembles ( goe ) .",
    "there are many classical probability results about gaussian ensembles .",
    "gaussian random matrices are known to have eigenvectors drawn uniformly from the set of @xmath9-dimensional vectors with unit norm , and the largest entry of a random matrix eigenvector will be bounded by a number scaling as @xmath144 with overwhelming probability .",
    "the density of eigenvalues of a properly normalized random matrix will obey the _ wigner semicircle law _ at scales greater than the average level spacing , i.e.  at @xmath145 ,    the concept of universality starts playing an interesting r@xmath146le once we shift our attention to wigner matrices , whose each entry is an independent , not necessarily gaussian random variable .",
    "typically one takes off - diagonal entries to have one distribution and on - diagonal elements to have a different distribution .",
    "the statement of interest is that the spectra of wigner matrices display the same statistics as gaussian random matrices as long as the first four moments of the off - diagonal distribution and the first two moments of the on - diagonal distribution match the appropriate moments of a gaussian distribution ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "note that universality may fail at the edges of the spectrum ; this means that some low - energy states may appear localized even if the rest of the spectrum is ergodic .",
    "both goe and wigner matrices are almost surely dense .",
    "many sparse random matrices are also known to fall into the gaussian universality class .",
    "in particular , adjacency matrices of random graphs with connectivity much lower than @xmath9 are sparse and typically ergodic , as seen on fig .  [",
    "fig rr graph entropies ] @xcite .",

    "in addition , in this case it is known that the bulk of the spectrum is ergodic , though there may be individual localized states , such as the highest energy state which is localized in momentum space ( uniformly delocalized across the entire graph in position space ) .",
    "adding relatively small disorder to the random graph hamiltonian does not significantly affect its ergodicity properties , as seen on fig .",
    "[ fig small disorder rr ] . even at strong @xmath5 disorder",
    ", the theory tends towards ergodicity in the large @xmath20 limit as long as the graph is sufficiently well connected ( fig .",
    "[ fig large disorder rr ] , left ) .",
    "if the disorder is strong enough to effectively separate the graph into disconnected pieces , however , ergodicity is lost ; the situation is analogous to that in percolation theories ( fig .",
    "[ fig large disorder rr ] , right ) .",
    "the study of phases reached as disorder is increased has a rich history ; see @xcite and references therein .",
    "finally , let us comment on one case where random matrix universality fails : wigner matrices whose entries have very large tails or infinite variance . in this case it can be proven that a large number of excited states are localized , with the maximal entry of each eigenvector being greater than @xmath150 .",
    "it was argued in @xcite that this is so because the matrix is dominated by its largest entries  in terms of our previous discussions , these correspond to @xmath136-function bumps .",
    "each bump serves to localize a state ( or more , depending on the symmetries ) , and due to the heavy tails of the distribution we may expect a hierarchy of isolated bumps , each weaker than the previous but much stronger than the next one , each localizing a few states , until finally the gaps in the hierarchy become too small and the remaining states ( if any ) are ergodic",

    "we will view each theory , spin chains included , as a particle moving between @xmath9 sites ; a closely related paradigm was exploited in @xcite .",
    "our analysis will be most neatly carried out on the space of all free hopping hamiltonians among these sites  or , in other words , the space of adjacency matrices on graphs with @xmath9 vertices .",
    "we will argue that it is the symmetry structure of this hopping that primarily determines the ergodicity of the theory , and that small modulations do not affect the ergodicity significantly .",
    "diagnostics of quantum ergodicity are basis - dependent . as mentioned in section [ subsec qc ] , our approach is to choose certain operators ( i.e.  certain @xmath10 matrices ) with a highly regular spectrum to provide us with basis vectors that would lead to useful definitions of ergodicity . here",
    "we will examine this convention in more detail .",
    "a necessary but not sufficient condition for an operator to have such a useful eigenbasis is that it has uniformly spaced eigenvalues  for instance , @xmath64 or @xmath191 for @xmath192  because then we may hope to arrive at a picture where each eigenstate can be assigned a regularly shaped area in phase space that is labeled by the corresponding eigenvalue .",
    "this would then allow us to understand ergodicity as a characterization of the spread of a given energy eigenstate across these regular cells in phase space .",
    "a regular spectrum is not enough to ensure this , however .",
    "if an operator @xmath37 has eigenvalues @xmath64 , the same will hold for @xmath193 with any orthogonal matrix @xmath194 . out of all operators with this spectrum , we need to find a convention that singles out a specific one and represents it as the diagonal matrix @xmath195 . this convention must be physically motivated : we must specify a reference state ( or a reference minimal projection operator ) as a localized state , i.e.  as a state that is the opposite of being ergodic .",
    "then we can demand that this state be an eigenstate of an operator with a regular spectrum .",
    "here is an example .",
    "if @xmath196 is the given localized state , let @xmath14 be the operator with a regular spectrum @xmath197 such that @xmath198 .",
    "then , consider the conjugate operator @xmath15 defined so that it has the same spectrum as @xmath14 , and such that @xmath17 .",
    "it follows that the states @xmath199 now provide a basis in which @xmath14 is diagonal .",
    "alternative conventions could have consisted of choosing any other eigenvalue to correspond to @xmath196 .    from now on",
    ", we always assume that the original localized state is known , and that @xmath14 is a diagonal operator in the basis containing this state .",
    "this is the most conservative ( least model - specific ) way to measure ergodicity that we are aware of .",
    "eigenbases of @xmath14 and its conjugate @xmath15 now contain only localized states .",
    "there are other operators whose eigenbases can be used to measure ergodicity .",
    "we will call these operators _ fully localized_. roughly , we expect that if @xmath37 is fully localized , so is @xmath200 whenever @xmath194 is sufficiently regular . by this",
    "we refer to matrices whose entries fall off exponentially with the distance from a diagonal , but also to permutation matrices and hadamard matrices that transform position eigenstates into momentum ones . in particular , taking @xmath194 to be block - diagonal with @xmath201 identical @xmath202 blocks of hadamard form gives an operator @xmath203 whose eigenbasis corresponds the usual coherent states .",
    "this basis is also known to be a good sensor of ergodicity , and the corresponding ir entropy is also called _ wehrl entropy _ @xcite . yet another fully localized basis is furnished by eigenstates of the harmonic oscillator , with the raising and lowering operators corresponding to the shifts @xmath15 . in general , any basis of integrable hamiltonians may work , and sometimes the basis of an underlying integrable theory ( the `` mean - field basis '' ) is used to diagnose ergodicity @xcite .    a word of caution is necessary here : the bases listed above can all be used to detect ergodicity , but it is not generally true that they will all lead to the same distribution of ir diversities @xmath204 , defined in .",
    "the cleanest analysis can be carried out when the hamiltonian and eigenvectors are all real - valued in the chosen basis , in which case we always expect to find the goe result @xmath70 for an ergodic eigenstate .",
    "the notion of fully localized operators is also important because it provides a way to count symmetries relevant to the ergodicity of a given theory . for any hamiltonian @xmath38",
    ", there are many operators that commute with it  in particular , any eigenstate @xmath205 defines a projection operator @xmath206 such that @xmath207 = 0 $ ] .",
    "however , @xmath208 will have one nonzero eigenvalue equal to unity , so it will not be fully localized .",
    "in fact , if a fully localized operator @xmath209 commutes with @xmath38 , then the theory is classical ( or completely integrable ) , as each eigenvalue of @xmath209 will label a single localized state whose time evolution will be independent of all other sectors .    to quantify this amount of `` usefulness '' in an operator that commutes with @xmath38 ,",
    "let a _ partially localized _ operator be one whose eigenvalues are regularly spaced but which may still have degeneracies .",
    "for instance , if @xmath9 is even , @xmath210 has two eigenvalues @xmath64 for each even @xmath211 ; for any @xmath9 , a projection onto a pure state @xmath208 has one nonzero eigenvalue and @xmath212 zero ones ; and the identity operator has @xmath9 equal eigenvalues .",
    "the number of distinct eigenvalues is what we call the _ degree of localization_. the lower the degree of localization , the less useful the operator is for diagnosing ergodicity .",
    "operators with an irregular spectrum generically do not usefully diagnose ergodicity , and the definition of full / partial localization is not meant to apply to them .",
    "the one exception we anticipate are operators whose eigenvalue gap statistics is poissonian . reversing the berry - tabor conjecture @xcite , we expect that a localized eigenbasis will be furnished by any operator with poisson - distributed gaps in the spectrum and for which the reference localized state is an eigenstate .",
    "moreover , we expect that such an operator can be constructed out of a fully localized operator @xmath37 as @xmath213 for some ( typically randomly distributed ) coefficients @xmath109 . of course , similarity transformations by a `` regular '' matrix @xmath194 will , as above , preserve the localization of the operator .    in terms of spectral statistics ,",
    "then , we conjecture that the distinction between ergodic and localized regimes is controlled , to a first approximation , by the maximal degree of localization found among all the symmetries of the hamiltonian . if a fully localized operator is a symmetry , all energy eigenstates will be localized .",
    "this follows trivially from the definition of localized operators .",
    "the same holds true if @xmath19 and the hamiltonian commutes with @xmath20 partially localized operators that correspond to motion along each direction @xmath32 , as these can be simultaneously diagonalized to provide a fully localized eigenbasis . on the other hand ,",
    "if only a few localized operators of degree one or two are symmetries , we a priori have no information how close the theory is to being maximally ergodic .",
    "this is where we must look for deeper structure in the hamiltonian , as we describe next .",
    "we begin by studying theories whose hamiltonians are adjacency matrices of graphs .",
    "many single - particle examples from section [ sec review ] fall into this category , including billiards and particles moving on unweighted random graphs .",
    "such hamiltonians represent _ free hopping _ on graphs .",
    "some spin systems can be also described as free hopping theories .",
    "consider a theory of @xmath20 spins with all unit couplings and built out of only @xmath165 operators , e.g. in the @xmath176 basis , this is a free hopping theory on @xmath214 sites .",
    "these sites are remarkably simple to visualize : each position eigenstate can be assigned to a corner of an @xmath20-dimensional hypercube @xcite .",
    "each term in the hamiltonian corresponds to a link connecting two vertices of this hypercube , and the result is a very structured , regular graph with connectivity equal to the number of different basis operators in the hamiltonian .    when are free hopping theories ergodic ?",
    "results reviewed in the previous section show that hopping on random regular graphs is ergodic , that hopping on graphs describing the usual billiards is almost ergodic , and that hopping on metric graphs is essentially not ergodic at all . in addition , the spin system presented above is clearly integrable , and in general a particle hopping freely on a regular grid - like graph is also integrable .",
    "these observations suggest that it is the amount of structure or symmetry in the graph that determines the ergodicity of its adjacency matrix .    from the point of view of trace formulae , this is not surprising .",
    "recall from eq .   that the density of states and other eigenvalue statistics are controlled by sums over periodic orbits of all lengths . in a generic free hopping theory",
    ", the trace formula requires all trajectories to be summed over  there is in general no semiclassical limit that picks out a small subset of classical orbits  and the weight of each trajectory depends merely on its length . if the numbers of periodic trajectories of different lengths are essentially independent of each other , we should expect that their summation within the trace formula will give rise to a central limit theorem effect and lead to universality .",
    "this property was indeed exploited for random regular graphs in @xcite .",
    "we do not possess a perfectly satisfactory analytical tool that would connect ergodicity with a specific trace formula ( but see @xcite for some special cases , and the references in @xcite for other methods for accessing eigenvector statistics analytically ) .",
    "being unable to make analytic progress , we turn to standard quantum - mechanical perturbation theory to illustrate our point heuristically . consider a free , fully localized hamiltonian @xmath215 with nondegenerate eigenvalues @xmath216 .",
    "if its eigenstates are denoted by @xmath217 , the eigenstates @xmath218 of a perturbed hamiltonian @xmath219 can be written as with the assumption that @xmath215 is fully localized means that there are no degeneracies , so ordinary perturbation theory should be valid . in general we must resum the entire perturbation series to get the correct eigenstates of the full hamiltonian .",
    "the fact that the full hamiltonian is finite and diagonalizable ensures that this series will converge .",
    "this expansion can be obtained to arbitrary order as a solution to @xmath220 using a formal power series in @xmath105 .",
    "writing we find the recurrence relation the @xmath221 case of this equation determines @xmath222 in terms of the lower - order terms , while @xmath223 determines @xmath224 .",
    "the `` diagonal '' coefficients @xmath225 are determined order - by - order in @xmath105 by demanding that states have unit norm . this condition can be written as the series of equations    we are interested in large values of @xmath105 , where we expect that eigenvectors of @xmath219 are approximately equal to those of @xmath226 .",
    "the full perturbation series must be resummed to get the needed answer .",
    "the situation looks similar to the one that arises when using trace formulae , and the behavior of eigenvector coefficients will be determined by high orders in perturbation theory . at very large @xmath45 , the terms contributing to @xmath227 will be of the form    let us now assign each unperturbed state @xmath205 to a graph site .",
    "the free hamiltonian does not cause any hoppings between these states ; links in the graph correspond to nonzero elements @xmath228 .",
    "thus , the @xmath229 order contribution to the @xmath230 coefficient of the @xmath231 eigenstate depends on the sum over all trajectories of length @xmath45 that connect sites @xmath95 and @xmath232 of the graph whose adjacency matrix is determined by @xmath38 .",
    "the case of free hopping theories is the simplest version of the above scenario . here",
    "a hermitian version of the position operator  of the form @xmath233  can be chosen as the unperturbed hamiltonian , and the hopping is taken to be the perturbation @xmath38 with strength @xmath105 much greater than unity .",
    "the coefficients @xmath234 can be chosen to get an unperturbed hamiltonian whose eigenvalues are @xmath191 for @xmath235 . since @xmath236 is either zero or one , @xmath237 is determined by tracking the trajectories of length @xmath45 that connect sites @xmath95 and @xmath232 .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath216 in and are now actual _ position",
    "_ labels running between 0 and 1 in @xmath114 increments .",
    "the contribution of each trajectory connecting @xmath95 and @xmath232 is simply the product of @xmath45 terms of the form @xmath238 .",
    "if the graph described by adjacency matrix @xmath38 is highly irregular , we can expect the weights of trajectories to be distributed randomly and almost independently .",
    "the sum of contributions of trajectories of all lengths  dominated by trajectories of large lengths , since there will be exponentially many of them  can now reasonably be expected to look like a sum of almost i.i.d .",
    "random variables . for a given @xmath95 and @xmath232 , by the central limit theorem",
    "this sum should look like a gaussian random variable .",
    "in other words , the coefficients @xmath239 , @xmath240 of any eigenstate @xmath218 can be expected to be gaussian - distributed at large enough @xmath9 .",
    "this argument is at best a heuristic , as we have not proven that the sum over trajectories amounts to a sum over identically distributed random variables .",
    "nevertheless , it is interesting to apply this idea to the problem of a particle hopping on a tree or on an otherwise expanding graph .",
    "the key feature of such graphs is that it is impossible to assign the position labels @xmath216 to sites such that trajectories of a given length between two fixed sites have very similar weights ; as the @xmath216 grow linearly with @xmath95 while the graph expands exponentially ( meaning that there are @xmath241 sites at distance @xmath242 away from a given site ) , for large enough @xmath45 the contributions from almost all trajectories of length @xmath45 will be uncorrelated products of @xmath243 factors where @xmath216 and @xmath244 are very far from each other in the spectrum of the free ( `` position '' ) hamiltonian .",
    "what happens in the converse case , when we study a particle hopping on a highly regular graph ?",
    "consider the motion on a regular , rectangular grid .",
    "then we may assign the position labels @xmath216 to sites in a regular , lexicographic way .",
    "for instance , if the grid is @xmath245 with @xmath246 , we can assign to a site with coordinates @xmath247 the label @xmath248 $ ] .",
    "the regularity of the grid means that @xmath249 for two linked sites will only depend on @xmath250 , so that the trajectories connecting @xmath251 and @xmath252 will have the same weights as those connecting @xmath253 and @xmath254 .",
    "thus the sum over trajectories in can not be represented as a sum over almost independent random variables , and no central limit theorem is applicable .",
    "the biggest drawback of the above analysis is its lack of rigor .",
    "it is not at all obvious why going to high orders in perturbation theory will cause the contributions from individual trajectories to cancel out and give a finite answer at @xmath255  indeed , numerical checks on truncated versions of do not indicate a perfect cancellation .",
    "a better ( albeit model - dependent ) approach is to start from an integrable free hopping theory and then to perturb it by @xmath256 terms that implement the additional hoppings that ruin integrability .",
    "the heuristic analysis presented above should still hold .",
    "we have seen that free hopping theories range from fully integrable to fully ergodic ones .",
    "there are two qualitatively different ways to perturb these theories .",
    "both of them have been discussed in various places in section [ sec review ] , and here we systematize this information .",
    "note that in all the cases given here , the strength of the perturbation is expressed in units in which the original free hopping theory has a hamiltonian with entries 0 and 1 ; this sets the scale of the theory .",
    "we first consider the possibility of assigning weights to different positions . in quantum mechanics",
    "this corresponds to turning on a position - dependent potential @xmath257 , in spin chains this corresponds to turning on a background magnetic field and @xmath258 interactions , and in quantum field theory this corresponds to adding any function of the fields ( interaction terms included ) to the hamiltonian .",
    "all of these perturbations appear as diagonal terms in the hamiltonian ( in the appropriate position basis ) .",
    "if we deform an integrable free hopping theory by a small diagonal perturbation ( say , by dialing a little bit of disorder ) , its localized symmetries become broken and the model starts becoming ergodic .",
    "moreover , if a fully ergodic regime occurs as the perturbation strength is increased , it must be smoothly connected to the integrable regime one started with , as we are working with a finite hilbert space dimension @xmath9 . as the results in sections [ subsec qm1 ] and [ subsec qm2 ] show",
    ", we may expect that perturbations of free hopping of size @xmath114 will start affecting the spectrum and delocalizing states .    on the one extreme in the space of all possible deformations",
    "lie the very simple perturbations , for instance adding smooth functions of the position to the hamiltonian ( corresponding to weighting vertices without breaking many symmetries ) .",
    "for example , we may add @xmath259 to the hamiltonian .",
    "doing this does not turn the system fully ergodic , even if the strength of the perturbation was @xmath5 .",
    "what does happen , however , is that localization in the @xmath165 ( momentum ) basis partially crosses over to localization in the @xmath176 ( position ) basis as @xmath105 grows .",
    "a similar story happened in the simple quantum mechanics models in section [ subsec qm1 ] , where complete momentum space localization crossed over to complete position space localization for potentials like @xmath260 .",
    "for such slowly varying , highly symmetric perturbations , the crossover is expected to finish at @xmath104 .    on the other extreme",
    "are the fully disordered perturbations , with weights on graphs randomly distributed .",
    "starting from a random regular graph , adding @xmath5 diagonal disorder does not significantly alter ergodicity .",
    "however , starting from a nonergodic free hopping theory , adding a finite amount of disorder breaks the symmetries of the theory and typically renders it ergodic , as shown in studies of spin chains ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "perturbations of @xmath5 strength that are more slowly varying but still not fully symmetric may render the theory partly ergodic , with some states localized , others fully ergodic , and yet others caught in the crossover between fully localized and fully ergodic .",
    "this is the typical scenario that happens in spin chains ( and interacting quantum field theories in general ) , where ergodicity is often achieved through interaction terms that are not disordered but that vary sufficiently fast across the space of all spin or field configurations .",
    "the perturbation theory heuristic presented in the previous subsection once again allows us to understand this .",
    "if we start from free hopping on a very regular graph , one way to make each trajectory contributing to @xmath239 essentially random is to turn the matrix elements @xmath261 into sufficiently complicated ( irregular ) functions of @xmath262 and @xmath263 .",
    "doing so will wash out the regularity of the @xmath216 s and once again lead to a central limit theorem . modulating the diagonal terms @xmath264",
    "can do the same thing , as terms such as @xmath265 and its powers will also enter the formula .    as an example , consider a local spin chain with @xmath20 spins .",
    "the hilbert space has dimension @xmath151 .",
    "locality means that the hamiltonian only has @xmath266 terms ; assuming only nearest- and next - nearest - neighbor interactions , there are @xmath267 terms .",
    "the free hopping theory has @xmath268 , which corresponds to a particle living on sites of an @xmath20-dimensional hypercube , with each site ( corresponding to @xmath33 eigenstates ) connected to @xmath267 others by a single hopping term .",
    "this hopping graph is very regular and the theory is integrable .",
    "now consider introducing a potential term @xmath269 into the hamiltonian , with @xmath270 $ ] .",
    "this term weights each spin configuration by a number between @xmath271 and @xmath20 .",
    "if the magnetic fields @xmath272 are distributed randomly , the weights of configurations connected by a single spin flip will be essentially independent random variables .",
    "trajectories that contribute to the perturbative corrections of various states will be products of these numbers , and adding them together may be expected to give a gaussian result .",
    "the same conclusion can be reached if @xmath272 is not random but still sufficiently quickly and irregularly varying with @xmath32 , so that the weights of trajectories can still look effectively random .",
    "any leftover regularity in the system , due e.g.  to particularly nice functions @xmath272 , may be reflected by the partial localization of the spectrum .",
    "note that typical quantum field theories encountered in the high - energy literature do not have any disorder or externally varying parameters , and instead rely only on local potential terms of the form @xmath273  e.g.  @xmath274  to enforce interactions ; it is therefore not surprising that many field theories typically possess non - ergodic parts of the spectrum , often manifested as excitations .",
    "as reviewed in sections [ subsec qm2 ] and [ subsec spin ] , adding strong disorder to any theory typically results in anderson or many - body localization . for a fixed dimension @xmath9",
    ", there exists a critical disorder strength below which no position space localization can be seen .",
    "in addition , above an upper critical disorder strength , all states are localized .",
    "( the nature of the free hopping theory and perturbation determine these critical strengths ; we remind the reader that for the mildest perturbations and integrable hopping theories , these critical strengths are expected to scale as @xmath76 and @xmath9 , respectively . )",
    "the reason why this happens is qualitatively clear from our analysis : a strong enough perturbation turns trajectory weights into random variables whose variance may grow quickly with @xmath45 .",
    "there are at least two ways the central limit theorem could fail now . on the one hand",
    ", @xmath239 may no longer be a sum of approximately identically distributed contributions , as trajectories with different lengths may be drawn from distributions with different variances . on the other hand , these variances may also diverge , meaning that the major contribution to @xmath239 at large @xmath9 comes from random variables with variance @xmath275 , and the central limit theorem does not apply in this case . a more detailed discussion of the localization transitions that happen as diagonal disorder is increased in gaussian random matrices and random regular graphs is given in @xcite .      off - diagonal",
    "perturbations involve momentum operators , and they move the free hopping hamiltonian away from the adjacency matrix form by modifying entries of unit value .",
    "we need only analyze the case of perturbations that decrease the weight of links , since we may always rescale the hamiltonian and ensure that the heighest - weight link has weight one and that all off - diagonal elements are within @xmath276 $ ] . from zero to nonzero values",
    ", we may view that theory as a perturbation of the free hopping theory where the entries @xmath277 were unity to begin with . ]",
    "what matters for ergodicity is merely the absolute value of the hopping terms , and in the following we will ( for simplicity ) assume that all terms in @xmath38 are positive .",
    "in the perturbative picture of section [ subsec free hopping ] , the contributions to @xmath239 already come with strongly varying signs ; changing the signs of some terms in the potential is not expected to affect the central limit theorem , if it holds .",
    "this case is in many ways dual to the case of diagonal perturbations . in the latter case",
    ", a site is rendered inaccessible if the potential at the site is much greater ( e.g.  by an @xmath278 factor ) than that of nearby sites  it then acts as a @xmath136-function obstacle that supports a localized state on top of it . in the off - diagonal case ,",
    "if a link between two sites outweighs all other links emanating from each of those sites by a huge factor ( e.g.  @xmath279 ) , we should expect a state localized on the two sites , and all the other eigenstates will act as if the two sites are identified . if the original graph had very low connectivity , increasing disorder will effectively remove many links and force eigenstates to localize in the remaining clusters of connected links .",
    "if the original graph connectivity was large enough , we still expect partial localization of the spectrum .",
    "these effects are clearly visible in random regular graphs with strong disorder ( fig .",
    "[ fig large disorder rr ] ) .",
    "we once again expect there to be two critical perturbation strengths associated to each integrable free hopping theory . when typical link weights between the upper critical strength and unity , the eigenstates are localized in momentum space . for typical weights between the two critical strengths ,",
    "the system is ergodic , and below the lower critical strength , the system is localized in position space . for very slowly varying perturbations",

    "each of them can nevertheless be perturbed by both diagonal and off - diagonal disorder . when perturbing ergodic theories , only the upper critical disorder strength is meaningful , and it marks the transition from ergodic to localized .",

    "perturbing the same theory with _ any _ finite cauchy off - diagonal disorder causes full position - space localization , and the critical breadth of cauchy disorder of mean one is found to scale as @xmath114 .",
    "the reason for this behavior is that the scale of the theory is set by the largest random coupling . in the case of cauchy disorder ,",
    "if @xmath40 is the number of links attached to each site , there are @xmath299 random couplings drawn from a heavy - tailed distribution of breadth @xmath300 .",
    "a good heuristic for the typical maximal coupling is that it scales as @xmath301 .",
    "( compare this with the gaussian maximal coupling @xmath302 . ) after rescaling to set this maximal coupling to unity , most couplings are now of order @xmath303 .",
    "thus , cauchy - disordering a random regular graph amounts to severely diluting the links of the graph .",
    "this leads to localization , just like in the percolation scenarios discussed in section [ subsec qm2 ] .",

    "conversely , momentum - localized free hopping theories correspond to matrices with no diagonal elements .",
    "each localized theory has a neighborhood of perturbations in which the ergodicity properties are unaffected , and outside this neighborhood there exists an intermediate regime where the theory is neither position- nor momentum - localized ( see fig .  [ fig landscape medium ] ) .",
    "the theory in this regime is ergodic or displays nonuniversal behavior associated to crossovers , depending on the statistics of the perturbation .      where does the syk model fit into the ergodicity landscape ?",
    "this question can be answered by studying its hamiltonian expressed in terms of pauli spin operators , .",
    "the corresponding free hopping theory is that of the two- and four - spin sherrington - kirkpatrick model , recall that @xmath304 , where @xmath20 is the number of majorana fermions .",
    "the corresponding graph consists of all plaquette and four - cube diagonals that can be drawn on an @xmath305-dimensional hypercube .",
    "each site has @xmath306 links emerging out of it .    the disorder that defines syk is both diagonal and off - diagonal .",
    "the full syk hamiltonian has three types of terms : @xmath307 , @xmath308 , and @xmath309 ( cf .  ) .",
    "the model has a total of @xmath310 different couplings , much fewer than the number of links in the corresponding graph , which is @xmath311 .",
    "this is very far from the standard off - diagonal disorder that we considered in the section [ subsec pert hopping ] , and correspondingly we may expect that the syk model is not as ergodic as a high - dimensional quantum percolation model .",
    "however , it turns out that even this comparatively small amount of disorder makes syk maximally ergodic , as seen on fig .",
    "[ fig syk ents ] .",
    "we recall , however , that the numerical results accessible to us all have @xmath312 .",
    "all evidence indicates that syk transitions from fully to partially ergodic as @xmath20 is dialed up across @xmath313 @xcite , and indeed the signatures of integrability and deviations from random matrix theories discussed in @xcite at @xmath314 are not likely to be captured by our numerics .",
    "conversely , we expect that our results may start deviating from random matrix behavior at sufficiently high @xmath20 .",
    "the fact that all couplings are drawn from the same distribution means that the rescaling that normalizes the maximal coupling in the hopping part will also normalize the diagonal disorder to be @xmath5 .",
    "thus the syk model will always be a strongly interacting theory with the position and momentum operators balanced , similarly to how the ising model becomes critical when the position and momentum operators have equal strengths . unlike random graphs where cauchy disorder  or even a sufficiently high - variance gaussian disorder",
    " was sufficient to localize the theory , this is not possible in syk .    the only deviation from ergodicity that we can numerically access comes from tuning the disorder away ( see fig .  [ fig syk medium disorder ] ) by choosing random couplings from a gaussian distribution like @xmath315 for small @xmath316 .",
    "at fixed @xmath20 , making all couplings effectively equal reduces ergodicity but does not fully localize the theory . for a fixed disorder strength @xmath316 , increasing @xmath20 brings the @xmath127-distribution closer to that of strongly disordered random regular graphs and ergodic spin chains without disorder ( figs .  [ fig large disorder rr ] and [ fig spins ] ) .",
    "these distributions have heavy tails that become less important in the large @xmath20 limit . in the case of the critical ising model",
    ", we have argued that the heavy tails seen there are due to free particle states giving rise to a linear @xmath127-distribution that cuts off at @xmath317 ( fig .",
    "[ fig ising ] ) . in the case of syk , we know that stringy states exist in the spectrum @xcite .",
    "it is tempting to speculate that the heavy tails seen at weak disorder come from these states , and that they disappear as @xmath318 because the spectrum is dominated by maximally ergodic states , the analogs of `` black hole microstates '' @xcite .",
    "we do not know whether this weak disorder limit becomes critical if @xmath316 scales with @xmath20 in a particular way .",
    "the fact that the @xmath127-distribution at low @xmath316 gives the same distribution @xmath319 at all @xmath20 , modulo a rescaling of bin widths , is intriguingly similar to the behavior seen near the critical region of the aubry - andr model , fig .",
    "[ fig aa transition ] , where conformal quantum mechanics is known to exist . studying this question in greater numerical detail is currently beyond our reach .",
    "additional perspective can be gained by studying the gurau - witten model @xcite , another majorana model whose large @xmath20 thermodynamics largely matches that of the syk model ( as both are governed by the same diagrams in a particular temperature regime ) .",
    "the gw model has @xmath320 fields @xmath321 , @xmath322 , each containing @xmath323 majorana fermions .",
    "the hamiltonian is , up to prefactors ,    when @xmath324 is odd , this model is very simply dualized to a spin system .",
    "let @xmath325 be multi - indices composed of @xmath324 numbers between @xmath286 and @xmath20 , and let us impose the lexicographical ordering ( e.g. @xmath326 ) on these multi - indices .",
    "then we dualize via the operators @xmath327 are copies of the usual pauli matrices , with @xmath328 .",
    "the gw model thus dualizes to @xmath329 coupled spin chains of @xmath323 spins each , for a total hilbert space dimension @xmath330 .",
    "note that is always an operator on a single spin chain , and it contains at most two momentum ( spin - flip ) operators .",
    "the gw hamiltonian thus consists of @xmath331 terms , and each flips at most two spins in each of the @xmath329 chains . in this sense",
    "the gw model is very similar to the syk model without disorder .",
    "we expect that their ergodic properties ( fig .",
    "[ fig syk medium disorder ] ) will be very similar .    in terms of hopping graphs , the ones corresponding to gurau - witten and syk at low disorder will be diagonally perturbed free hopping theories , as was the graph of the ergodic spin chain without disorder .",
    "these graphs will have a lot of symmetries and we expect some deviation from random matrix behavior in all of these models .",
    "the graph connectivities @xmath332 differ in all these cases , and this will be reflected in different details of the tail behavior in the @xmath127-distributions .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with our results ( figs .",
    "[ fig spins ] and [ fig syk medium disorder ] ) and with numerical studies of the gurau - witten model , which have found that already the eigenvalue diagnostics of chaos fail to agree with predictions from random matrix theory , even though numerics are only viable for the modest values of @xmath333 and @xmath334 @xcite .",
    "of course , we caution that more numeric and analytic work is needed to understand whether these similarities hold below the surface .    finally , recall that the feynman diagrams that compute the free energy in a large window of temperatures agree between the gurau - witten model and syk with the usual @xmath110 disorder .",
    "this leads us to conjecture that the deviation from maximal ergodicity in the @xmath335 regime of the usual syk model will be analogous to the deviation from maximal ergodicity found in the weakly disordered syk model , as the latter is expected to be in the same region of the ergodicity landscape as the gurau - witten model based on our graph structure considerations . beyond spin systems , this regime of deviating from ergodicity is also exhibited in strongly disordered random regular graphs , fig .",
    "[ fig large disorder rr ] .",
    "it is natural ( although rash ) to interpret all of these deviations as signatures of quasi - particles or `` quasi - strings '' that correspond to relatively localized eigenstates within the spectrum .",
    "it would be extremely interesting to understand these issues in greater detail .",
    "the goal of this paper was to understand how quantum ergodicity varies across the landscape of all quantum theories with a given hilbert space dimension .",
    "we have delineated the rough outlines of each important region of this landscape , but have not attempted to understand the fate of the landscape in the continuum / thermodynamic limit . in particular , we have not provided a criterion that distinguishes which crossovers become phase transitions in this limit .",
    "understanding this would provide valuable insight into the structure of the ergodicity landscape .    on a related note , we reported glimpses of universal behavior that is neither localized nor ergodic .",
    "this critical regime is found only in a handful of theories  aubry - andr models , @xmath124 quantum mechanics , and perhaps weakly disordered syk  and corresponds to what is often called `` conformal quantum mechanics '' in the literature .",
    "while conformal symmetry in general does not strongly affect ergodicity ( even in 2d , there are conformal theories that are ergodic and have btz black holes in their gravity duals ; see also @xcite ) , this avatar of conformality appears to bear a remarkable ergodic signature that deserves further scrutiny .    a question related to our ergodicity landscape program concerns classifying",

    "these questions have recently been addressed in @xcite , and its main diagnostic tool  the frame potential  may well serve the same landscaping purpose as our ir entropies and diversities .",
    "the related question of developing a complexity - based metric on the space of all theories was discussed in @xcite and references therein .",
    "yet another question related to studying the space of all unitary evolution operators pertains to the spectral universality of periodically driven systems @xcite .    finally , a topic that we did not address at all concerns the distinction between anderson- and many - body - localization in the position - localized theories .",
