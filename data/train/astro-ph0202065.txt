    "was observed by _ chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _  soon after these observatories were launched .",
    "in the first observation ( 8.8 ks ) of the core region by _ chandra _  in 1999 october , 121 point sources were identified within the central @xmath3 region and the nucleus was nicely resolved into five point sources which were not seen in previous missions ( @xcite ) . moreover",
    ", a bright transient was discovered @xmath4 from the nucleus . a relatively deeper _ xmm - newton_observation ( 34.8 ks ) was made in 2000 june ; 116 sources were detected down to a limiting luminosity of @xmath5  ( 0.312 kpc ; @xcite ) and a pulsating supersoft transient with a periodicity of @xmath6 s was discovered ( @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , both _",
    "chandra_(@xcite ; @xcite ) and _ xmm - newton_(@xcite ) observations confirmed that the unresolved x - ray emission in the core region is much softer than most of the resolved x - ray sources in that region .",
    "fifteen x - ray point sources are newly associated with globular clusters ( @xcite ) , which when combined with the previous _ rosat _  results ( @xcite ) brings the total number of m31 globular clusters with detected x - ray emission to 48 .",
    "_ chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _  also discovered several bright ( @xmath7 ) transients in m31 and m32 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the brightest of these reached a peak luminosity of @xmath8 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we report herein a brief summary of our _ chandra _  monitoring program of m31 in the past two years ; it will mainly focus on the properties ( identifications , temporal and spectral variability , and luminosity function ) of point sources in the central @xmath9 region of m31 as deduced from eight separate @xmath10ks acis - i observations spanning @xmath11  years .",
    "in addition , we will also present early results of an x - ray resolved supernova remnant and an updated `` x - ray movie '' of m31 up to 2002 january .",
    "m31 was observed with _ chandra _",
    "regularly as part of the ao-1 and ao-2 gto program during 19992001 ( this program continues as go observations in ao-3 ) . the program is originally designed to search for transients in m31 .",
    "these observations consist of a series of hrc snapshots ( @xmath12 ks ) which cover the whole galaxy ( see figure  [ akong - e3_fig : fig1 ] ) ; once a transient is found , a follow - up acis ( @xmath10 ks ) observation then images the newly - discovered transient , otherwise , acis points to the nuclear region . in this paper",
    ", we mainly focus on the acis - i ( i0 , i1 , i2 and i3 ) data centered in the central @xmath13 region of m31 ; this consists of 8 separate observations from 1999 october to 2001 june , with exposure times ranging from 4 to 8.8 ks .",
    "the actual region covered by the _ chandra _",
    "observations is slightly larger than @xmath13 due to different roll angles .",
    "sources near the outer edge of acis are therefore not observable in all eight exposures .",
    "in addition , we also make use of the hrc data and other acis pointings to construct the long - term lightcurves of sources .    in order to create a deep image suitable for the detection of faint sources ,",
    "the eight observations were combined into a single stacked image with a total integration time of 39.7 ks .",
    "figure  [ akong - e3_fig : fig2 ] shows the stacked `` true color '' image of m31 , which is a composite of images from soft ( 0.31.0 kev ) , middle ( 12 kev ) and hard ( 27 kev ) bands .",
    "soft sources appear red , moderately hard sources appear green , and the hardest sources appear blue . the image has been corrected for exposure and smoothed slightly with a gaussian ( @xmath14 ) in order to improve the appearance of point sources ; diffuse emission around the nucleus is also clearly shown .",
    "also shown in figure  [ akong - e3_fig : fig2 ] is the `` true color '' image of the central @xmath15 region of m31 with @xmath16 pixel resolution , with the possible nuclear counterpart ( m31@xmath17 ) marked ( garcia 2001 ) .",
    "discrete sources in the stacked image were found with wavdetect ( @xcite ) , a wavelet detection algorithm implemented within ciao .",
    "the central @xmath15 region was treated separately by using the @xmath16 image .",
    "a total of 204 sources were detected above @xmath18 .",
    "we cross - correlated the source list with existing catalogs of m31 objects .",
    "we find that 77 _ chandra _  sources have counterparts in the _ rosat _  hri catalog ( @xcite ) .",
    "the remaining 127 ( @xmath19 ) _ chandra_sources were not detected in the _ rosat _  hri catalog , presumably because they are below the _ rosat _  detection limit or are variable .",
    "chandra _",
    "catalog extends @xmath20 fainter than the _ rosat _  hri catalog .",
    "we identify 22 _ chandra _  sources with globular clusters ; twelve of these globular clusters are identified as x - ray sources for the first time .",
    "we find two matches with supernova remnant ( snr ) .",
    "in particular , one of the them is spatially resolved by _",
    "chandra _",
    "( see  5 ) .",
    "eight planetary nebula ( pn ) are found to be associated with our _ chandra _  sources .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of our pn candidates are at least 3 order of magnitude brighter than that in our galaxy ( e.g. @xcite ) ; the x - ray colors are generally harder as well .",
    "therefore , it is possible that these pn are either very unusual or something other than pn .",
    "we suggest that these may be objects similar to in our galaxy ( i.e. symbiotic stars with a neutron star companion ) .",
    "we searched for matches between stellar nova as listed in the iauc contemporaneous to and within the field - of - view of our _ chandra _  observations , and found no matches within @xmath21 .",
    "we also searched for matches with ob associations , as o and b stars may be moderate x - ray sources ( @xmath22erg  s@xmath23 , @xcite ) . while this is well below our detection limit , a group of o and/or b stars may reach our detection threshold , and star forming regions could conceivably harbor massive x - ray binaries . however , we found no matches within our search radius of @xmath21 .",
    "five possible foreground objects are also found in our field based on their x - ray colors and coincidence of stars .",
    "the eight _ chandra _  acis - i observations described herein span nearly 2 years from 19992001 .",
    "this is substantially longer than previous surveys by _ rosat _",
    "( 2 observations separated by @xmath12 year ) . in order to study long - term x - ray variability , we computed a variability parameter following @xcite .",
    "we found 99 x - ray variables , corresponding to @xmath24% of the total . by comparing _",
    "rosat _  observations to _ einstein _",
    "observaitions 10  years earlier , @xcite found that @xmath25% of the x - ray sources within central @xmath26 region were variable . by comparing two _ xmm - newton _  observaitions separated by six months",
    "@xcite found that @xmath27% of the sources in the central @xmath28 were variable .",
    "we have also discovered 13 bright transients for which the source is found in at least one observation with luminosity of @xmath29 erg s@xmath23 and is not detected in at least one of the other observations .",
    "note that the luminosity limit covers typical outburst luminosities of soft x - ray transients and be / x - ray binaries in our galaxy .",
    "one important transient was missed by this analysis because it had a peak luminosity below our `` bright transient '' threshold during the eight acis - i observations considered here .",
    "this object is xmmu j004234.1 + 411808 (= cxom31 j004234.3 + 411809 ) , which @xcite suggest is an x - ray nova . by adding all",
    "the published x - ray transients in m31 found by _",
    "chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _  ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , we conclude that there are 25 `` bright '' transients in m31 ( and m32 ) in the past two years .",
    "figure  3 shows five representative lightcurves of transients found in m31 and m32 .",
    "the transient discovered with _",
    "chandra _  in the first observation ( @xcite ) remained in outburst for more than one year and finally turned off in 2001 june ( figure 3 ) .",
    "in addition , three hrc - i data points indicate that the source underwent flarings or state transitions during the early stage of the outburst . during the whole outburst ,",
    "the energy spectrum is consistent with a power - law with slope of @xmath11 ( see inset of figure 3 ) .",
    "the remaining three transients show typical lightcurves with a fast rise followed by an exponential decay like those seen in our galaxy ( @xcite ) .",
    "the characteristic decay time is about 3050 days .",
    "cxom31 j004309.7 + 411901 is a recurrent transient ; the source was detected with _",
    "einstein _ , _ rosat _  hri and _ rosat _  pspc at luminosities ranging from 1 to 8 @xmath30 .",
    "@xcite noted variability between pspc exposures of a factor of 5 .",
    "except for the first _",
    "chandra _",
    "observations , the source underwent a state transition to the low state at @xmath31 ; it re - brightened to @xmath32 in 2001 november and shows decay in 2002 january observations . beginning in the summer of 2001 , we also monitored newly discovered x - ray transients with _",
    "hst _ to search for uv counterparts .",
    "this program allows us to follow the evolution of six transients in m31 during their outbursts in both x - rays and uv ; it will be the first step in extending the highly successful _",
    "rxte_/asm and optical follow - up of galactic x - ray transients to our nearest neighbor spiral galaxy .",
    "in addition to transients , we also found several sources which have interesting long - term lightcurve .",
    "for example ,",
    "cxom31j004218.5 + 411758 is in the m31 globular cluster bo86 and shows a possible @xmath33 day modulation .",
    "this is reminiscent of the galactic source in the globular cluster , which has a 176-d long - term modulation .",
    "it is worth noting that x - ray variability on long time - scales ( from days to years ) has been found in many low - mass and high - mass x - ray binaries in our galaxy ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we searched for spectral variability in all of the sources using a method analogous to that described in @xcite , but replacing the flux with hardness ratio .",
    "only 12 sources show spectral variability , corresponding to 6% of the total population .",
    "this is of course a lower limit , as small changes in the spectra of weak sources are undetectable with the number of counts accumulated in our 40  ks of merged data . in order to further investigate the nature of the spectral variations , we fit simple spectra to two of the brighter spectral variables .",
    "the fits show that as the counting rate increases , the spectrum becomes harder ( see figure  4 ) .",
    "this is reminiscent of atoll and z sources in our galaxy ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the luminosity of these two sources ranges from @xmath34 erg s@xmath23 , which is higher than the typical luminosity ( @xmath35 erg s@xmath23 ) of atoll sources .",
    "however , this luminosity is similar to that of the z  sources , which are believed to reach the eddington limit ( @xcite ) .",
    "the luminosity and spectral changes appear consistent with that seen in z sources as they move along the `` normal branch '' .",
    "these are probably the first extragalactic z sources to be identified , except for ( @xcite ) .",
    "continued monitoring may confirm the nature of these sources by allowing us to trace out the full z - shape of the spectral variations expected if this analogy is correct .",
    "spectral variation is also seen in transients during their evolution away from the outburst .",
    "figure  4 shows the spectral evolution of the brightest transient ( @xmath36 ) ever found in m31 ( @xcite ) ; the source becomes harder during the decay of the outburst . while the source is in its decay stage",
    ", it is still relatively bright in a recent observations taken in 2002 january ( @xmath37 @xmath38 ) .",
    "we have identified two snrs in the central region of m31 with _",
    "chandra _ , and both of them were detected by _ rosat _  previously .",
    "one of them ( cxom31 j004327.7 + 411829 ) is found to be extended in x - rays as a distinct ring - shaped object with a diameter of @xmath39 ( 33 pc ) .",
    "figure  5 shows the `` true color '' x - ray image of the snr ; also shown is the hardness ratio image of the snr .",
    "it is clear that bright spots can be seen in north - western and southern regions of the snr .",
    "this snr is also detected in several optical surveys ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) ; it was identified as an irregular , faint and high [ sii]/h@xmath40 ( @xmath12 ) snr .",
    "the optical extension is about @xmath41 , with a crescent open in the south - eastern part of the snr .",
    "our x - ray image also shows similar morphology .    initial examination of a 40ks acis observations on 2001 october indicates that a non - equilibrium ionization ( nei ) model with interstellar absorption is appropriate for modeling the snr s spectrum .",
    "it is also evident that the spectrum is dominated by a broad emission of o viii line at 0.654 kev and a blend of fe l shell lines and ne k shell lines around 0.9 kev .",
    "the best fitting nei model indicates a 0.37 kev emitted luminosity of @xmath42 .",
    "in figure  6 we plot the cumulative luminosity function ( clf ) for all detected sources in the stacked image , and also separately the lfs of inner bulge ( region  1 ; central @xmath43 ) , outer bulge ( region  2 ; central @xmath44 excluding region  1 ) , disk ( region  3 ; central @xmath45 excluding regions  1 + 2 ) , and bulge ( regions  1 + 2 combined ) .",
    "the lf for all sources has a break at @xmath46 , with @xmath47 before the break and @xmath48 after the break .",
    "this result is in good agreement with previous _",
    "rosat _  ( @xcite ) and _ xmm - newton_(@xcite ) measurements of the lf .",
    "the clf for the inner bulge is significantly different , with a break at a lower luminosity ( @xmath49 ) and a significantly flatter distribution at the faint end .",
    "we performed a two - sample kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test for the lfs of inner bulge and disk , and find that there is only 3% probability that they are drawn from the same distribution .",
    "simulations show that the flattening of the clf of inner bulge is not due to incompleteness .",
    "however , the counts in a clf are not independent and therefore direct fits to it will underestimate the errors and may produce a biased best estimate of the slope . in order to more accurately estimate the errors and slopes , we used a maximum likelihood method ( e.g. @xcite ) to determine the slopes in the differential luminosity functions ( dlfs ) .",
    "for the inner bulge , the lf is roughly consistent with a single power - law with @xmath50 although the appearance of the lfs ( figure  6 ) and the results of simulations indicate the presence of a brake to a flatter lf at the lowest fluxes .",
    "however , we note that the statistics in the inner bulge region are insufficient to confirm the presence and constrain the size of the break.the slope of the outer bulge and disk below the break is roughly consistent with 0.50.6 .",
    "further away from the inner bulge , a break appears near @xmath38  and it shifts to higher luminosity when considering the disk region ( see figure  6 ) .",
    "in addition , the slope becomes steeper ( from @xmath51 1.0 to 2.2 ) when moving from the bulge to disk .",
    "the black holes and neutron stars that power many of the m31 x - ray sources have formed through the evolution of initially massive stars . because of this , the x - ray lf traces the history of star formation and evolution of these massive stars in binary systems .",
    "breaks in the lf may indicate indicate an impulsive star formation event .",
    "as the x - ray binaries age , their average luminosity shifts to lower values and therefore the location of the break may be an indication of the how long ago the star formation event occurred ( @xcite ) .",
    "luminosity functions which do not show a break may indicate that star formation is still occurring .",
    "chandra observations have measured the breaks in the lfs of several nearby galaxies , e.g. m81 ( @xcite ) , ( @xcite ) , ( @xcite ) and m83 ( @xcite ) , and these breaks have been interpreted as evidence for impulsive star formation . within m31 , we find that the lf of three regions we studied have breaks at a different luminosities .",
    "the inner bulge has this break at the lowest luminosity , and the luminosity of the break increases monotonically as we go out from the inner bulge .",
    "if the breaks do indicate the epochs of star formation events , then these events occurred most recently in the disk of m31 and further back in time as we move towards the nucleus of m31 .    as well as the monotonic shift in the break luminosity",
    ", there is a monotonic shift in the slopes of the lfs . as we move in towards the nucleus these slopes become progressively flatter",
    "this is somewhat difficult to understand in the context of the discussion above , because the most luminous sources would be expected to have the shortest lifetimes .",
    "loss of these sources as they age would tend to steepen the luminosity function , but we find flatter luminosity functions in the apparently older populations .",
    "it is interesting to compare the lf of these three regions of m31 to those of other galaxies .",
    "m31 is not the first galaxy found to show a break in its lf nor is it the first to show different lfs in different regions ; both m81 ( @xcite ) and m83 ( @xcite ) show similar behavior . in cases where a single slope is fit to the lf ( ie , there is no clear break ) the lfs of early type galaxies and the bulges of spirals tend to be steeper ( @xmath52 ) than those of spiral disks and galaxies with active star forming regions ( @xmath53 , e.g , @xcite ) .",
    "the opposite seems to be the case within m31 : the disk has a steeper lf than the bulge region .",
    "we speculate that this difference may be related to the location of the breaks in the m31 lf , which are at a lower luminosity that those seen in other galaxies . at these lower luminosities we may be sampling a different class of source , and",
    "the steepness of the lf may be due inclusion of this new class of faint sources rather than a loss of bright sources .",
    "we note that there is some evidence that we are sampling a different class of sources as we move out from the bulge , in that the fraction of sources which show variability decreases monotonically . if these sources have an intrinsically steeper lf than bright accreting binaries they may be able to cause the steepening of the lfs as we move from the bulge towards the disk .",
    "in the past two years , _ chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _  have produced fruitful results on m31 ( there are 7 papers related to m31 in this meeting ) .",
    "clearly , it is just a beginning while data are still being analyzed and will be coming in in near future .",
    "a series of papers about the point source properties , the diffuse emission , the x - ray emission from the central supermassive black hole , and supersoft source populations are being prepared by our _ chandra _  team . on the other hand ,",
    "an extensive _ xmm - newton _  survey on m31 is undergoing and the results would allow us for a detailed studies of point source properties and populations on the whole galaxy .",
