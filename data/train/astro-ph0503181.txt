    "current cosmological models restrict the baryon fraction in the universe to a few per cent of its total matter and energy content . a large fraction of that amount of atoms , ions and electrons is strongly suspected to reside in the intergalactic medium .",
    "lyman @xmath3 clouds ( including damped lyman @xmath3 absorption systems ) are seen to dominate the baryon content of the universe at high redshift @xcite , but at lower redshifts their number density and the subsequent contribution to the ordinary matter content of the universe decrease .",
    "detailed simulations of the cosmological evolution of the baryons invariably show that the lyman @xmath3 absorbing gas at temperatures @xmath10 undergoes shock heating at lower redshifts and its temperature rises to @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the baryons in the warm and hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) reach 40 - 60 per cent of the total baryon budget in the local universe , according to above simulations .",
    "indeed , most of these whim baryons live in small sparse concentrations , and only those in the deepest potential wells ( groups and clusters of galaxies ) can be seen through their x - ray emission . for the remaining of the whim , resonance absorption lines from highly ionized elements ( ovi , ovii , oviii , neix , etc . )",
    "are the best chance to detect them @xcite .",
    "tenuous gas is best detected by absorption rather than by emission , if a bright ( and featureless ) enough source can be found , typically an agn .",
    "the limiting equivalent width detectable for a resonance absorption line is ultimately determined by the spectral resolution of the spectrograph in use ( assuming proper channel over - sampling of each resolution element ) but most often limited by the signal to noise ratio .",
    "very roughly , for a typical @xmath12 spectrum , where each spectral resolution element is sampled by a few channels , the weakest absorption line detectable has an equivalent width of the order of the width of one channel . for the reflection grating spectrometer - rgs @xcite that we use in this paper ,",
    "the spectral resolution of the first order spectra is around @xmath13 , and therefore with a good quality spectrum we might hope to detect lines as weak as @xmath14 . with the slightly higher spectral resolution grating spectrographs on _ chandra _ ,",
    "lines as weak as @xmath15 can be detected , given sufficient signal to noise .    in the recent years",
    "there have been a number of detections of resonance absorption lines arising in the whim , both in the soft x - ray band ( with _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ ) and in the far - ultraviolet band ( with _ fuse _ ) .",
    "a local component of the whim was first discovered by @xcite using _ chandra _ and _ fuse _ data towards pks 2155 - 204 .",
    "@xcite reported on the discovery of local ovii absorption towards pks 2155 - 204 , 3c273 and mkn 421 with _",

    "@xcite detect oviii k@xmath3 absorption towards the radiogalaxy 3c120 , which can be interpreted either as intervening gas at @xmath17 or as gas ejected by 3c120 at a velocity of @xmath18 .",
    "the current status of the detection of features from the non - local whim has been recently compiled by @xcite . in that work ,",
    "it is hinted that whim absorption lines can account for the missing baryons in the low - redshift universe .    in this paper",
    "we present observations of the bl - lac object pks 0548 - 322 at @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "prior to that @xcite had detected the presence of a group of galaxies at @xmath19 around this object , suggesting that pks 0548 - 322 might be a cluster member .",
    "much more recent work by @xcite found that there is indeed a cluster ( a s549 ) around this bl - lac object , but at its average redshift of @xmath1 .",
    "x - ray emission from this cluster is very complicated to detect and measure given the brightness of pks 0548 - 322 .",
    "we first use the rgs spectra to search for absorption lines .",
    "the single unresolved line found is identified as ovi k@xmath3 at a redshift intermediate between that of the bl lac and observer .",
    "we then use the epic pn spectrum to help constraining the column density and doppler velocity parameter of the absorber .",
    "we conclude by examining the turbulence of the absorbing gas and its possible temperature under the assumption of ionisation equilibrium .",
    "pks 0548322 was observed by _ xmm - newton _",
    "@xcite during its 520th revolution , starting on the 11th of october of 2002 , as part of the ao-2 science operations ( obsid number is 0142270101 ) .",
    "the observation lasted for 94,500 sec . according to the analysis of the light - curves of the various x - ray instruments , the radiation environment conditions were good and with low background except for the last @xmath20 ks where strong flaring appeared .",
    "the pipeline products that were delivered to us had been processed with version 5.3.3 of the _ xmm - newton _ science analysis software ( sas ) .",
    "however , all data products were reprocessed using version 6.0.0 of the sas . in addition , the reprocessing incorporated a number of effective area corrections with respect to the earlier pipeline processed data .",
    "rgs1 _ and _ rgs2 _ data were filtered for high background flare intervals , following the data analysis threads under the _ xmm - newton _ soc pages .",
    "this resulted in 84,600 s of good exposure time for both spectrographs .",
    "both spectrographs were operated in high event rate mode .",
    "the spectra of order @xmath21 and @xmath22 of pks 0548 - 322 were detected in both spectrographs .",
    "the 2nd order spectra , however , had very few counts and were ignored in this work .",
    "the resulting 1st order spectra ( in bins of width around @xmath23 in the central part of the spectra ) have a variable signal to noise ratio across the spectrum , which range from virtually zero below 6  and above 35  to a peak value of around @xmath24 at wavelengths @xmath25 .",
    "the search for absorption lines in the rgs spectra , needs to start with the determination of the continuum level . in order to perform this ,",
    "we have smoothed the spectra by grouping both the rgs1 and rgs2 data in bins containing at least 50 counts .",
    "the regions below 7and above 35 , where the sensitivity of the rgs is very small , have been excluded from any further consideration .",
    "the determination of a good local continuum level is crucial to assess the significance of any putative absorption line , and therefore we have restricted the continuum fits to patches of the rgs spectra where the residuals do not show any large trends .    .[tabfits ] fits to various wavelength regions with a power law absorbed by the galactic column .

    "although the range of equivalent widths allowed at 90 per cent level is large , it is clear that some level of doppler broadening needs to be present or otherwise the implied value of @xmath32 would be very large .    to gain more insight on the physical modeling of the absorption line ,",
    "we have performed a doppler - broadened voigt profile fitting to the ratio of the data to model in rgs1 .",
    "the voigt profile has been approximated with the formula by @xcite ( accurate to better than 5 per cent ) , the thermal broadening is parameterized in terms of the @xmath26 parameter and the spectrometer response has been modeled as a gaussian of fwhm @xmath33 outside xspec ( i.e. , the model spectrum has been convolved with that gaussian before being compared to the ratio of data to continuum ) .",
    "natural broadening ( both radiative and auto - ionising ) is only relevant to very high column densities and it has been ignored here .",
    "fits were restricted to the @xmath34 range .    since a fit with the three parameters ( @xmath32 , @xmath26 and @xmath35 ) left free yielded an undefined value for @xmath26 ( @xmath36 , 1-sigma error )",
    ", we fixed @xmath26 to a reasonable value of @xmath37 ( see later ) .",
    "the best fit provides a substantial improvement of the @xmath38 which goes from 182.4 for 171 data points to 164.94 with 2 degrees of freedom less .",

    "our own analysis of that data is entirely consistent with this .",
    "in fact , including an ovi absorption line with the parameters fixed to the above values , to the ratio of data to continuum in the 22 - 24region of the shorter exposure spectrum results in an _ increase _ of the @xmath42 from 59.13 ( for 59 degrees of freedom ) to 66.73 .",
    "this increase is , however , too modest to exclude the possibility that the line is present in the noisier spectrum .",

    "@xcite have specifically studied the cosmological distribution of ovi absorbers via simulations .",
    "large column density systems , such as the one tentatively detected here , are extremely rare according to the simulations .",
    "if confirmed , this would represent a strong challenge to our knowledge of the distribution of baryons in cosmic scales .",
