    "recent experiments on the fractional quantum hall state at half - filling ( @xmath3 ) @xcite and on the high temperature superconductor ( htsc ) la@xmath4sr@xmath5cuo@xmath6 in a high magnetic field quenching the superconducting state @xcite have revealed an unexpected logarithmic temperature dependence of the ( longitudinal ) resistivity @xmath7 .",
    "similar behavior in htsc compounds with low transition temperatures has been reported earlier in low or vanishing magnetic field @xcite .",
    "there are several known sources of a logarithmical rise of resistivity with decreasing temperature .",
    "the first one , due to the kondo effect @xcite of localized magnetic spins , may be excluded here since the large magnetic fields employed in the fqhe @xcite and in the htsc @xcite experiments would quench the kondo effect up to a rather high energy scale .",
    "this eliminates the possibility of a @xmath8 dependence at the observed low temperatures . also , there is no indication of the existence of local moments in these systems .",
    "the second possible source is weak localisation ( wl ) of charge carriers in a @xmath0 disordered potential .",
    "however , the large magnetic fields used in the experiments @xcite destroy the quantum coherent backscattering effect responsible for wl .",
    "wl may contribute to the @xmath8 behavior observed in htsc in zero magnetic field @xcite , though .",
    "however , the magnitude of the @xmath9 term found in these experiments is too large to be explained solely by the wl .",
    "the third effect giving rise to @xmath10 at low temperature @xmath11 derives from the quantum interference of impurity scattering and interaction between the charge carriers . roughly speaking , the diffusive rather than ballistic motion of charge carriers in a random potential increases the time two interacting particles spend near each other and enhances therefore the interaction strength . in @xmath0",
    "the correction even diverges , eventually leading to the localization of the particles at zero temperature .",
    "the effect was discovered by altshuler and aronov ( aa ) @xcite , who obtained the quantum correction to the conductivity @xmath12 .",
    "here @xmath13 is the quantum unit of conductance , @xmath14 is the lifetime due to elastic scattering , and @xmath15 is a numerical coefficient . the quantity @xmath16 is due to hartree processes and is equal to the exact static scattering amplitude of a particle and a hole with total spin @xmath17 .",
    "it is usually positive , leading to partial cancellation of the exchange contribution represented by the first term ( unity ) in brackets , and tends to zero in the limit of weak screening . as we will discuss in detail below ,",
    "the magnitude of the logarithmic term observed experimentally in htsc materials and at @xmath3 is typically a factor of @xmath18 larger than the aa result .",
    "as we will show , enhancement factors of this order may be obtained if the interaction by a fictitious gauge field is considered in addition to the usual coulomb interaction .",
    "the problem of particles interacting with a transverse gauge field was studied by reizer @xcite in the context of magnetic interaction of electrons in metals .",
    "more recently , its 2d version has attracted considerable interest @xcite in connection with the gauge theory of high-@xmath2 superconductors @xcite and the chern - simons theory of the half - filled landau level @xcite .",
    "both of these theories have definite successes in explaining the experimental situation and seem to capture at least the essential physics of the phenomena .",
    "this has motivated us to study in detail the low - temperature correction to conductivity in the framework of the above gauge theories . in the context of half - filled landau level",
    "such a calculation was very recently done by khveshchenko @xcite .",
    "we find however that his results are incomplete ( some of the temperature regimes are missing , some relevant parameters are not introduced ) and contain some errors in the coefficients , which are crucial for comparison to the experimental data .",
    "we start from considering a simplified model of spinless fermions subject to a static random potential / magnetic field and coupled to a transverse gauge field , in the absense of any other interactions .",
    "complications which arise in the cases of composite fermions at @xmath3 and the gauge theory of high-@xmath2 compounds will be discussed in the next two sections .",
    "the transverse part of the gauge field propagator is determined by the polarization tensor of fermions and has the form@xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is the diamagnetic susceptibility , with @xmath22 being the fermion mass .",
    "the conductivity @xmath23 may be approximated by its static , long wavelength limit , @xmath24 , with @xmath25 the fermi wave number and @xmath26 the transport mean free path .",
    "the quantum correction to the conductivity is calculated following altshuler and aronov in lowest order of perturbation theory in the gauge field interaction for charge carriers diffusing in a random potential and/or random magnetic field .",
    "vertex corrections due to impurity scattering are responsible for the singular enhancement of the interaction and are included consistently in lowest order in the disorder parameter @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the fermi energy and @xmath29 is the momentum ( transport ) relaxation time due to impurity scattering .",
    "the two leading diagrams for the conductivity are shown in fig.1 .",
    "three more diagrams included by aa are not relevant in the case of a transverse gauge field considered here , since they are not affected by diffusion poles .",
    "the solid lines in fig.1 denote green s functions @xmath30^{-1 } \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the matsubara energy , @xmath32 is the quasiparticle energy for momentum @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the single particle relaxation time",
    ". as we shall show , the single particle time drops out of the final result , so we will not be concerned about the difficulties encountered with the definition of @xmath34 in the case of random magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "the wavy line in fig.1 represents the gauge field propagator , @xmath35 , and the shaded blocks denote `` diffusons '' ( particle - hole propagators ) , given by @xcite @xmath36 assuming the energies of a particle and a hole have opposite signs . here",
    "@xmath37 is the density of states at the fermi level , @xmath38 is the diffusion coefficient , and @xmath39 where @xmath40 denotes averaging over the fermi surface . at small frequency and momentum ,",
    "@xmath41 is dominated by the singular contribution , which is given in the case of spatial isotropy , @xmath42 , by @xmath43 the regular part @xmath44 is however also important , since it determines the vertex renormalization , denoted by shaded triangles on fig.1 .",
    "@xmath44 may be expressed in terms of the eigenvalues @xmath45 and eigenfunctions @xmath46 of the bare scattering cross section @xmath47 as @xmath48 excluding the eigenvalue @xmath49 associated with particle number conservation .",
    "the diffusion coefficient is defined in this framework as @xmath50 in the case of spatial isotropy @xmath51 ( @xmath52 is the polar angle of the momentum @xmath53 ) , and eq.([e5 ] ) reduces to @xmath54 the velocity vertex @xmath55 renormalizes to @xmath56 this applies when the energy sign is opposite for two fermion lines attached to the vertex ; otherwise , the vertex retains its bare form @xmath55 .",
    "now we calculate the conductivity correction represented by the two diagrams of fig.1 ( plus the same diagrams with reversed arrows ) in the matsubara technique .",
    "each of the two fermion loops produces the factor @xmath57 .",
    "the diffuson is approximated by eq.([e4 ] ) provided the two fermion lines it connects have opposite energy signs .",
    "this requirement implies that exactly two of four velocity vertices get renormalized according to eq.([e7 ] ) . combining all this ,",
    "we find that the total relaxation rate @xmath14 drops out , and the conductivity correction at a matsubara frequency @xmath58 takes the following form : @xmath59 where @xmath60 carrying out the analytical continuation to real values of the frequency @xmath61 , we get @xmath62\\ , \\label{e10}\\ ] ] with @xmath63 now we are going to evaluate eqs.([e10 ] ) , ( [ e11 ] ) at zero external frequency @xmath61 , when eq.([e11 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath64 \\nonumber\\\\ & \\simeq&-\\mbox{im}{2e^2n_0d^2\\over \\pi}\\int_t^{1/\\tau_{tr}}f(0,\\omega)d\\omega   \\label{e12}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the integrand in eq.([e11 ] ) has at @xmath65 three characteristic momentum scales , where its behavior changes :    * @xmath66 , determined by the first factor in the denominator ; * @xmath67 , determined by the second factor in the denominator ; * @xmath68 , which limits the applicability of the diffusion approximation .    comparing these three scales , we see that @xmath69 is the smallest one , whereas the relation between the other two depends on the value of frequency @xmath70 .",
    "we distinguish therefore the following two frequency domains :    * @xmath71 .",
    "+ in this region @xmath72 , and the integral ( [ e11 ] ) yields @xmath73 * @xmath74 .",
    "+ in this case , @xmath75 , yielding @xmath76    substituting eqs.([e23a ] ) , ( [ e24 ] ) in eq.([e12 ] ) , we get the following result for the correction to the conductivity @xmath77 we see that at low temperatures the correction has the familiar @xmath9 form , but with the coefficient enhanced by a large factor @xmath78 as compared to the usual altshuler - aronov result @xcite .",
    "the longitudinal resistivity @xmath7 of a hall bar in a strong magnetic field shows oscillations with minima at filling factors @xmath79 of the lowest landau level , where @xmath80 is a positive or negative integer . for not too large values of @xmath80 , @xmath81 ,",
    "the resistivity is exactly zero at the minima and the hall resistivity is quantized : @xmath82 . in the opposite limit @xmath83 , or @xmath84 , @xmath7 tends to a finite limiting value , which is approached in a form of decaying oscillations , reminiscent of shubnikov  de haas oscillations in weak magnetic fields .",
    "this and other observations has been interpreted as indicating a kind of fermi liquid state near @xmath3 . as a possible theoretical framework for this phenomenon , jain @xcite has proposed the composite fermion picture , in which a physical electron is replaced by a fermion threaded by a flux - tube carrying two flux quanta oriented oppositely to the external magnetic field @xmath85 .",
    "the mean field generated by the flux tubes reduces the applied magnetic field to the effective field @xmath86 ( @xmath87 is the electron density ) , which vanishes at half - filling .",
    "the quantized values of @xmath88 correspond to integer filling factors for the landau levels in the effective fields , providing a natural explanation for the dominance of the observed plateau values .",
    "a field - theoretical formalism implementing this idea with the help of a chern - simons ( cs ) gauge field has been worked out by lopez and fradkin @xcite . following a similar approach , halperin , lee and",
    "read @xcite have developed a theory for the half - filled landau level , in which the fluctuations of the gauge field about the mean field are treated in the random phase approximation ( rpa ) . at this level of approximation , the transverse part of the gauge field propagator has the form ( [ e1 ] ) . here",
    "the renormalized diamagnetic susceptibility is given by @xcite @xmath89+{v(q)\\over ( 4\\pi)^2}\\ , \\label{e2}\\ ] ] where @xmath90 is the hall conductivity of composite fermions , which vanishes at @xmath3 , and @xmath91 is the coulomb interaction @xmath92 , with @xmath93 being the dielectric constant .",
    "the screening parameter @xmath94 is governed by the polarization of external charges in gates , leads , doping layers , etc .      in the case of unscreened coulomb interaction , @xmath95 ,",
    "the effective susceptibility @xmath96 is determined by the last term in eq.([e2 ] ) : @xmath97 the momentum scale @xmath98 is now given by @xmath99 comparing it to @xmath69 and @xmath68 , we find that one should distinguish now between the three following regions of frequency :    * @xmath100 , + where @xmath101 is a numerical constant , which is of order of 10 according to the experimental data @xcite . in this low - frequency region",
    "we have @xmath102 , and the integral ( [ e11 ] ) can be estimated as @xmath103 * @xmath104 .",
    "+ in this domain @xmath105 , and we find @xmath106   \\label{e15}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] * @xmath107 .",
    "+ now we have @xmath108 , and @xmath109 is given by eq.([e24 ] ) .",
    "evaluating finally the frequency integral in eq.([e12 ] ) , we find the following correction to the conductivity @xmath110 } \\ , & \\qquad t_1\\ll t\\ll t_2 \\\\ \\displaystyle { -\\ln^2 ( t\\tau_{tr } ) } \\ , & \\qquad t_2\\ll t\\ll 1/\\tau_{tr } \\end{array } \\right . \\label{e17}\\ ] ]      now we will suppose the coulomb interaction to be screened with a short enough screening length @xmath111 , so that its fourier transform can be replaced by a constant @xmath112 the susceptibility @xmath96 is then according to eq.([e2 ] ) given by @xmath113 taking into account that @xmath114 and @xmath115 , we can neglect all but the last term in eq.([e19 ] ) , so that @xmath116 the scale @xmath98 is now given by @xmath117 we will assume that @xmath118 so that @xmath69 is the smallest of the three scales @xmath69 , @xmath98 and @xmath68 .",

    "\\label{e25}\\ ] ]    let us estimate the magnitude of the low - temperature logarithmic correction .",
    "we will take for this purpose the typical values of the parameters @xmath123 @xcite and @xmath124 @xcite .",
    "further , we assume the screening length @xmath125 to be of order of the spacer distance @xmath126 , so that @xmath127 .",
    "then the coefficient @xmath128 of the low - temperature correction @xmath129 can be estimated as @xmath130 .",
    "this value is in good agreement with the experimental results , @xmath131 reported in ref.@xcite .",
    "we should note , however , that the transport mean free time @xmath29 and the crossover temperature @xmath132 are estimated with these values of parameters as @xmath133 and @xmath134 , so that the experimental data of ref.@xcite belong mainly to the high - temperature region ( second line of eq.([e25 ] ) ) .",
    "though the slope @xmath135 of the corresponding log - squared behavior is the same at @xmath136 as for the simple logarithmic behavior at @xmath137 , it is expected to decrease according to eq.([e25 ] ) with @xmath11 approaching @xmath138 .",
    "this would lead to a curvature of the graph @xmath139 ; a feature , which seems not be observed in the experiment @xcite .",
    "the reason of this discrepancy is not clear to us at the present stage .",
    "the properties of the high-@xmath2 superconducting compounds are governed by the physics of the quasi - two - dimensional system of cuo@xmath6-planes .",
    "a good candidate model is the @xmath1hamiltonian of two - dimensional electrons interacting via a nearest neighbor spin exchange interaction @xmath140 and hopping on a square lattice with nearest neighbor amplitude @xmath141 .",
    "only the regime of small hole doping is of interest .",
    "the hopping is constrained to singly occupied lattice sites , on account of the large on site coulomb repulsion on the cu sites .",
    "it is difficult to implement the constraint in analytic approximations .",
    "a widely used method is the slave boson approach , in which bosons ( @xmath142 ) are introduced to describe the empty lattice sites , in addition to two fermion ( @xmath143 ) species with spin up and down .",
    "the constraint takes the form @xmath144 for each lattice site @xmath145 . a mean field approximation using the coherent hopping amplitudes @xmath146 , @xmath147 , the boson condensation amplitude @xmath148 , and the singlet pair amplitude @xmath149 as collective fields yields a phase diagram , which remarkably resembles experimental observations",
    "we are here interested in the normal state properties at optimal doping , which is the phase where @xmath146 and @xmath150 are finite , while @xmath148 and @xmath149 are zero ( strange metal phase ) . in this phase",
    "the low energy fluctuations about the mean field may be described in terms of a @xmath151 gauge field , introduced to restore the local constraint violated in mean field theory .",
    "the properties of the effective fermion  boson  gauge field theory have been discussed by ioffe and larkin and by lee and nagaosa among others @xcite .",
    "the gauge field propagator has the form ( [ e1 ] ) , with the conductivity @xmath152 and the susceptibility @xmath96 given now by the sum of fermion and boson contributions : @xmath153 , @xmath154 . since the concentration of bosons is equal to that of the holes and is therefore small for low doping , it is believed that @xmath155 , so that the gauge field propagator ( [ e1 ] ) is determined essentially by the fermion polarization . for the fermion conductivity @xmath156 we could use therefore the above analysis of sec.[s1a ] with the final result ( [ e25a ] ) .",
    "however , according to the ioffe - larkin composition rule , the physical conductivity ( response to an external electromagnetic field ) is given not by @xmath153 , but rather by @xmath157 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath155 we have @xmath158 , so that physical conductivity is dominated by bosons .",
    "one can argue that the repulsive interaction prevents them from bose - condensation ( except possibly at very low temperatures ) , and the bosons form a kind of fermi surface .",
    "then our above consideration in sec.[s1a ] can still be applied . however , since the diffusion coefficient @xmath38 in eqs.([e10 ] ) , ( [ e11 ] ) refers now to bosons , whereas the conductivity @xmath152 entering the gauge field propagator corresponds to fermions , we get an extra small overall factor @xmath159 in the final result , eq.([e25a ] ) . in addition , the factor @xmath160 in the argument of the logarithm is replaced by @xmath161 , where @xmath162 is a characteristic momentum of the bosons , and @xmath163 and @xmath26 are fermion and boson mean free paths , respectively .",
    "let us compare these results with experimental findings . in ref.@xcite data for the value of the coefficient @xmath128 of the logarithmic correction eq.([e26 ] )",
    "are presented for lasrcuo samples with values of @xmath160 ranging from @xmath164 to @xmath165 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath128 s lie in the interval 0.81.8 and show a tendency of slight increase with the value of @xmath160 .",
    "these results are in a surprisingly good agreement with our eq.([e25a ] ) , but without the extra factor @xmath159 .",
    "similar conclusion can be drawn from the analysis of other experimental data @xcite .",
    "we are thus forced to conclude that in the present state of the gauge theory of high-@xmath2 materials , the magnitude of the correction to the physical conductivity due to the exchange of the gauge field is much smaller that its experimentally measured value , because of the small factor @xmath159 . however , taking into account the rather good agreement between the experiment and the theoretical result ( [ e25a ] ) without this factor , it is tempting to speculate about possible modification of the gauge theory .",
    "the factor @xmath159 would not appear , if @xmath166 would fall below @xmath167 for most of the @xmath168-regime of interest ( @xmath169 ) .",
    "this would require the characteristic momentum @xmath162 in @xmath170 to be much larger than the fermi momentum @xmath171 .",
    "alternatively , the effective gauge theory might include only one type of particles .",
    "we have calculated the quantum correction to the conductivity of charge carriers in a two - dimensional disordered system subject to a transverse gauge field interaction .",
    "we find the @xmath8 behavior at low temperature , but with a coefficient strongly enhanced as compared to the usual altshuler - aronov result . at higher temperatures , a crossover to @xmath172 behavior",
    "the results are in good quantitative agreement with the recently observed @xmath8 dependence of the resistivity at half filling of the landau level .",
    "we have also discussed the possible relevance of our results to the low temperature resistivity of high-@xmath2 superconducting compounds in the framework of a gauge field model .",
