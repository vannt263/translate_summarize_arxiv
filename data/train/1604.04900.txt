    "pionic helium is a three - body system composed of a helium nucleus , an electron in a ground state and a @xmath5 in a highly excited rydberg state with principal quantum number @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the reduced mass of @xmath5 and the helium nucleus .",
    "these states promptly de - excite via auger transitions to lower lying states which have large overlap with the helium nucleus and subsequently undergo fast nuclear absorption for times less than @xmath8 s. however long - lived @xmath5 were observed in bubble - chamber experiments @xcite .",
    "to explain this anomaly , condo suggested that metastable atomic states of @xmath5 are formed @xmath9_{nl } + e^-\\ ] ] in which @xmath5 occupies states with high angular momentum @xmath10 .",
    "these rydberg states are expected to retain nanosecond - scale lifetimes against nuclear absorption and the electroweak decay @xmath11 .",
    "this is because for nearly circular orbits of @xmath5 , the overlap with the helium nucleus is minimized , whereas radiative de - excitation and the decay via auger transitions which lead to fast nuclear absorption are strongly supressed .",
    "this hypothesis has been confirmed at triumf in experiments with @xmath5 stopped in liquid helium @xcite .",
    "a method for laser spectroscopy of metastable pionic helium atoms in gaseous helium has been proposed @xcite . when comparing experimental transition frequencies to three - body qed calculations of pionic helium ,",
    "the @xmath5 mass can be determined with a fractional precision better than @xmath12 .",
    "however systematic effects such as collision - induced shift and broadening ( s&b ) of the transition lines , as well as the quenching of the metastable states can prevent the experiment from achieving this high precision",
    ". thus reliable theoretical calculation for the density - dependent shift and width is needed for the extrapolation of transition wavelengths at zero target density .",
    "the collisional shift and broadening of the laser stimulated transition line @xmath13 in pionic helium are obtained in the impact approximation of the binary collision theory of the spectral line shape @xcite .",
    "this approach has already been applied in the calculations of the density effects on the line shape in antiprotonic helium @xcite and produced theoretical results in agreement with experiment @xcite ; see also @xcite and references therein .",
    "the success of these calculations was due to the use of a highly accurate three - electron potential energy surface ( pes ) for the description of the binary interaction of an exotic helium atom with the atoms of the helium gas .",
    "the pes had been evaluated with _",
    "ab initio _ quantum chemistry methods @xcite for nearly 400 configurations of the three heavy constituents of the interacting atoms ( two helium nuclei and an antiproton or pion ) , selected to match the typical interpaticle distances in the experimentally interesting metastable states of exotic helium @xcite .",
    "the configurations were parameterized with the length @xmath14 of the vector joining the heavy particles in the antiprotonic / pionic atom , the length @xmath15 of the vector joining its center - of - mass with the nucleus of the ordinary helium atom , and the angle @xmath16 between them .",
    "subsequently , the numerical values of the pes at these @xmath17400 grid points were fitted with smooth functions @xmath18 .",
    "two such fits , referred to as d47 and hn1 , have been widely used in calculations ; they have been shown to produce numerical results for the s&b in antiprotonic helium that differ by less than the overall numerical uncertainty .",
    "earlier attempts to use the same pes in the evaluation of the s&b of the spectral lines in pionic helium failed @xcite because the typical distances @xmath14 between the pion and the helium nucleus in the pionic helium metastable states are outside the range for which the pes has been calculated , and the two fits d47 and hn1 produce wrong values when used for extrapolation of the pes . in the present work we carefully analyzed the behavior of these fits and established that the problem can be resolved by appropriately truncating the integration over @xmath14 in the expression for the effective state - dependent interatomic potentials in terms of @xmath18 and the pionic helium atom wave function @xmath19 @xmath20 while keeping under control at each step the induced numerical uncertainties ; the optimal values of the truncating parameters were found to be @xmath21 a.u . , @xmath22 a.u .",
    "the s&b of the four transition lines in pionic helium of experimental interest @xcite were then evaluated by two alternative methods .",
    "similar to the calculation of the s&b in antiprotonic helium @xcite , the obtained results differ by up to 30% and should be regarded as boundaries of the intervals of uncertainty of the theoretical values of the density shift and broadening slopes in pionic helium .      in this approximation ,",

    "as the comparison demonstrates , the anistropic pairwise interaction has minor effect on the line shifts , which justifies our approximation of using central state - dependent potentials to describe the collision .",

    "this emphasizes once more the importance of using a realistic and accurate pes in the evaluation of the density effects ; estimates based on the asymptotic shape of the interaction potentials , valid for @xmath124 a.u . , can not be reliable .",

    "as long as both fits give close results for antiprotonic helium , we have no reasons to consider any of them as preferable ; instead , the difference between the two values should be regarded as numerical uncertainty of the results that could only be eliminated with a new calculation of the pes for a wider range of configurations .",
