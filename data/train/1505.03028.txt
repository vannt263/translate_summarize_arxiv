    "<S> in a recent work , using a coupled microresonator system with tailored gain and loss parameters b. peng et al . </S>",
    "<S> [ _ science _ * 346 * , 328 ( 2014 ) ] have experimentally reported on an apparently counterintuitive effect in laser theory , namely the possibility to enhance lasing by increasing loss in the system . </S>",
    "<S> the observed phenomenon was related to the existence of an exceptional point in the system and was presented somehow as an unexpected and novel effect , especially by some reporters and scientific blogs . in this communication </S>",
    "<S> it is pointed out that the phenomenon of loss - induced lasing does not come as a surprise in known laser theory and that it is not necessarily related to the physics of exceptional points . </S>",
    "<S> loss - induced lasing is basically the lasing mechanism that occurs in loss - coupled distributed feedback lasers . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism dates back to the 1970 s , has a simple physical explanation and does not rely on the physics of exceptional points .    </S>",
    "<S> lasing is based on the interplay between optical gain and optical feedback in a cavity . </S>",
    "<S> once the gain provided through external pumping overcomes the loss in the cavity , lasing sets in for the spatial and frequency cavity mode with the lowest threshold @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , loss is a natural adversary of lasing , at least in common lasers . </S>",
    "<S> however , this is not always the case when losses ( or gain ) are not uniformly distributed in the medium . using a pair of coupled optical micro - resonators with tailored gain and loss , in a recent experiment @xcite peng et al . reported a violation of such a simple picture , demonstrating that by steering the parameters of the system to the vicinity of an exceptional point ( ep ) lasing can be enhanced when the total loss of the system is increased . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , the authors found that an increase of total loss in the system first annihilates an existing raman laser , however beyond a critical value lasing recovers despite the increasing loss . </S>",
    "<S> other unusual effects in the laser behavior , related to the appearance of eps , have been emphasized in other recent papers as well , such as the anomalous dependence of laser output power on pumping level and pump - induced lasing death @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such experimental findings , and especially the fact that losses can enhance ( rather than suppress ) lasing , are attracting considerable resonance since they apparently seem to violate some basic picture of lasing that we have learned in textbooks , as some reporters and scientific blogs wrote commenting on such experimental findings @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while the above mentioned effects are surely uncommon and recent experiments have beautifully used integrated photonic structures to visualize the physics of non - hermitian and @xmath0-symmetric systems , as a matter of fact loss - induced lasing is not a new nor a surprising result in laser physics , even at textbooks level . </S>",
    "<S> when loss or gain in the system are not uniformly distributed , the lasing mode can avoid to occupy the regions with largest loss , and an increase of total ( average ) losses in the system could paradoxically , in some cases , yield a reduction of the _ effective _ losses experienced by the mode , i.e. an increase of total losses could enhance ( rather than prevent ) lasing . </S>",
    "<S> such a behavior is not new in laser physics . </S>",
    "<S> it can be observed without resorting to the properties of eps and it is at work in a kind of technologically important lasers like semiconductor lasers : loss - coupled distributed - feedback ( lc - dfb ) laser ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . </S>",
    "<S> lc - dfb lasers were earlier developed for semiconductor lasers as a mean for single frequency operation robust against spatial hole burning , contrary to index - coupled dfb lasers with a uniform index grating that tend to emit into two modes far apart from the bragg frequency . in lc - dfb lasers losses </S>",
    "<S> play the fundamental role of providing optical feedback , thus they are helpful ( rather than detrimental ) for lasing .    </S>",
    "<S> it is the aim of this short communication to remark that loss - induced lasing is not a new nor a surprising effect in known laser theory and that it does not necessarily require a system to operate near an exceptional point . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we show that in a lc - dfb structure laser threshold can astonishingly _ decrease _ as the average loss in the system _ increases _ : i.e. lasing can benefit from an increase ( rather than a decrease ) of total losses in the system like in ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is actually nothing magic and a simple physical explanation can be given , which does not rely on concepts like eps taken from non - hermitian physics .     versus the mean loss of the grating @xmath1 ( solid curve ) . </S>",
    "<S> above ( below ) the dashed curve the lasing threshold is higher ( smaller ) than the mean loss . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2 occurs at @xmath3 . for the values of @xmath1 corresponding to the squares on the solid curve , </S>",
    "<S> the detailed behavior of the spectral transmittance in the complex frequency plane is depicted in fig.2 . ]     in the complex @xmath4 plane ( pseudocolor maps in log scale ) for increasing values of @xmath1 [ square points in fig.1(b ) ] : ( a ) @xmath5 , ( b ) @xmath6 , ( c ) @xmath7 , and ( d ) @xmath8 . ]    let us consider one - dimensional wave propagation in a dielectric waveguide , and let us assume that some spatially uniform optical gain @xmath9 per unit length , spectrally flat at around a frequency @xmath10 , is applied by some external pumping in the waveguide region @xmath11 of length @xmath12 [ fig.1(a ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> such a system clearly behaves like an optical amplifier , however lasing can not occur because of the absence of any optical feedback ( infinite output coupling losses ) . </S>",
    "<S> optical feedback can be introduced by adding some refractive index discontinuities ( e.g. fresnel reflections from the facets of a semiconductor / air interface ) , or by distributed optical feedback via a periodic index grating . </S>",
    "<S> however , the same goal can be achieved by means of a _ loss grating _ : in this case loss - induced lasing can be realized . </S>",
    "<S> let us introduce in the waveguide region @xmath11 a loss grating with spatial period @xmath13 and amplitude @xmath14 , yielding a spatially - dependent loss rate per unit length @xmath15 $ ] , where @xmath16 is the mode index of the waveguide and @xmath17 is the speed of light in vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> clearly the grating introduces spatially - dependent losses in the system that vary periodically between zero and @xmath18 and with a spatial average loss rate @xmath14 . despite </S>",
    "<S> the grating introduces losses into the dielectric waveguide , it provides some distributed optical feedback , thus allowing lasing at the bragg frequency @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> _ losses can be thus turned into effective gain for lasing_. the laser threshold @xmath19 turns out to be a function of @xmath1 solely and its behavior is shown in fig.1(b ) . in the figure the behavior of the _ spatial average _ losses in the system @xmath20 is also depicted by the dashed curve . </S>",
    "<S> the threshold curve can be calculated by standard coupled - mode theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the electric field @xmath21 in the one - dimensional guide structure can be written as a superposition of counter - propagating waves @xmath22 where the slowly - varying amplitudes @xmath23 of counter - propagating waves satisfy coupled - mode equations @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the group velocity . </S>",
    "<S> equations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) hold in the grating region , i.e. for @xmath11 , whereas outside the grating region ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) the right hand sides of the equations should be replaced by zero </S>",
    "<S> . looking at a solution to eqs.(2 ) and ( 3 ) of the form @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is a ( generally complex ) frequency detuning from the bragg reference frequency @xmath10 , the amplitudes @xmath30 at @xmath31 and @xmath32 are related by the linear relation @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the @xmath35 transfer matrix . </S>",
    "<S> the laser threshold @xmath36 can be obtained by looking at the poles of the transmission function @xmath37 in the lower half part of the complex @xmath29 plane ( @xmath38 ) by taking @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> such poles correspond to resonance modes of the passive structure ( see for instance @xcite ) and are found as the roots of the transcendental equation @xmath40 where we have set @xmath41 the real and imaginary parts of each pole @xmath29 determine the frequency detuning from bragg frequency and decay rate of the resonance modes of the passive structure . </S>",
    "<S> the introduction of a uniform gain @xmath42 just shifts the poles upward toward the real axis , and lasing is obtained when a pole crosses the real axis @xmath43 ; the lasing mode is thus the one closer to the real axis @xmath43 when @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> after introduction of the normalized frequency detuning @xmath44 , the imaginary part ( in absolute value ) of @xmath4 of the most unstable mode corresponds to the lasing threshold @xmath45 of the resonance mode once the uniform gain @xmath9 is applied . </S>",
    "<S> the most unstable mode always occurs at @xmath46 , i.e. at the bragg frequency . </S>",
    "<S> this is shown in fig.2 , which depicts contour - plots of @xmath47 at a few increasing values of the average loss parameter @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> note that , as @xmath48 , the lasing threshold goes to infinity [ see fig.1(b ) ] : this is because in the absence of the loss grating there is not optical feedback in the system and laser can not start . as @xmath20 ( i.e the mean loss ) </S>",
    "<S> increases , lasing is possible and , contrary to what happens in a conventional laser system , the laser threshold _ </S>",
    "<S> decreases _ as the mean loss @xmath1 of the system is increased . </S>",
    "<S> the reason thereof is that , while the average losses in the system increase , the optical feedback increases as well thus effectively reducing the _ output _ coupling losses . at @xmath49 </S>",
    "<S> the laser threshold shows a minimum , and as losses are further increased the laser threshold increases . at @xmath50 the gain and </S>",
    "<S> mean losses equal each other ; in this conditon the intensity distribution along the structure is uniform , a feature that was noticed and exploited in earlies studies on lc - dfb lasers for stable single - frequency operation against spatial hole burning @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath51 , i.e. above the crossing point of the two curves in fig.1(b ) , the gain at laser threshold gets _ </S>",
    "<S> lower _ than the average losses in the system , and @xmath52 as @xmath53 . in a practical device </S>",
    "<S> the realization of a pure gain grating is challenging , and nowadays dfb lasers are generally based on index gratings with phase shifts @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless such a simple example , that is taken from basic theory of dfb optical structures , clearly indicates that loss - induced lasing is not a new nor a surprising effect in laser physics . </S>",
    "<S> the example points out that eps are not necessarily involved here for the observation of loss - induced lasing : indeed lasing arises here , as in the most common laser systems , by a _ </S>",
    "<S> simple _ pole that crosses the real axis , without any coalescence of poles ( see fig.2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> hence no exceptional points arise here . </S>",
    "<S> a simpler and rather general explanation of loss - induced lasing can be given from a different point of view : in any laser system the gain at threshold equals the mode losses , and _ not _ the average cavity losses . </S>",
    "<S> the two losses are general distinct because of the inhomogeneous distributions of field and losses . in most conventional laser systems </S>",
    "<S> the mode losses increase with the average losses , however whenever the losses affect the mode field distribution this trend can be modified and eventually reversed , such as in the lc - dfb structures where losses are beneficial because they introduce optical feedback .    for the sake of completeness </S>",
    "<S> , it is worth mentioning that a scenario similar to the one reported in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , i.e. laser death and subsequent revival as total losses in the system are increased that arises from pole coalescence , could be naturally observed in the lc - dfb system when two low - reflectance mirrors of reflectance @xmath54 are placed at @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> such a reflectance can arise , for example , from fresnel reflection at the semiconductor facets . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , in the absence of the loss grating ( @xmath56 ) laser oscillation can arise for sufficiently high gain @xmath42 because of the fabry - perot cavity formed by the two mirrors at @xmath31 and @xmath32 . as @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> is increased from zero , the overall losses in the system are increased , a feature which does not favor lasing ; however additional feedback is induced by the loss grating , which can add in phase or in opposite phase with the feedback provided by the mirrors . in the former case the loss - induced feedback enhances lasing in the fabry - perot cavity mode at bragg frequency , whereas in the latter case it counteracts it . </S>",
    "<S> the interplay among the above mentioned effects determines the lasing threshold , which can be determined by coupled - mode theory considering the modified form of the spectral transmission function @xmath57 taking into account the effect of additional mirrors , i.e. of the fabry - perot cavity . indicating by @xmath58 the reflection coefficient of the two mirrors , eq.(5 ) is replaced by the following one @xmath59   \\cos ( \\theta l ) + \\\\   </S>",
    "<S> \\left [ i \\frac{\\sigma}{\\theta } \\left ( 1+r \\exp(2 i \\phi+ 2 i k_0l ) \\right )   -\\frac{\\delta}{\\theta } \\sqrt{r }   ( 1 + \\exp(2ik_0l ) ) \\exp(i \\phi )   \\right ] \\sin ( \\theta l)=0 . </S>",
    "<S> \\nonumber    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath60 , the laser threshold of the fabry - perot longitudinal modes is the same for all modes and given by the usual relation @xmath61 ; see fig.3(a ) . to show the phenomenon of loss - induced suppression and revival of lasing , </S>",
    "<S> let us consider the case @xmath62 ( @xmath63 integer number ) , i.e. the cavity length @xmath12 is an integer multiple than the grating semi - period @xmath64 , and @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> this case corresponds to distributed feedback for the bragg mode induced by the grating which is in anti - phase as compared to the optical feedback provided by the fabry - perot cavity .     and @xmath32 ( reflection @xmath58 ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) @xmath66 ( fabry - perot cavity without the loss grating ) , ( b ) @xmath67 , ( c ) @xmath68 , ( d ) @xmath69 , ( e ) @xmath70 , and ( f ) @xmath71 . the other parameter values are @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 integer multiple than @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> labels @xmath76 and @xmath77 highlight the central ( bragg ) and two lateral longitudinal modes of the fabry - perot cavity . </S>",
    "<S> the arrows in the panels show the motion in the complex plane of the poles associated to such three modes as @xmath1 is increased . in panels ( e ) and ( f ) </S>",
    "<S> the mode 0 has an imaginary part smaller than @xmath78 and it is thus no more visible . </S>",
    "<S> the horizontal dashed lines depict the level of uniform gain ( @xmath79 ) . </S>",
    "<S> poles above ( below ) the dashed curve are above ( below ) laser threshold . ]    </S>",
    "<S> figure 3 shows , as an example , a few snapshots of the spectral transmission @xmath80 in the complex @xmath4 plane for increasing values of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the horizontal dashed line in the figures indicates the value of the uniform gain parameter @xmath42 , which is chosen in the example equal to @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> any pole of the transmission function that lie above the dashed curve is a lasing mode , whereas the poles below the dashed curve are resonance states , i.e. they are below threshold for lasing . </S>",
    "<S> as it can be seen from an inspection of the figure , at @xmath60 all the longitudinal modes of the fabry - perot cavity have the same threshold and can lase [ fig.3(a ) ] . at low values of @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> the system is still lasing [ fig.3(b ) ] , and the role of the grating is to increase the threshold of all modes and to make the central ( bragg ) mode , labelled by 0 in the figure , the highest - threshold mode . </S>",
    "<S> such a behavior stems from the fact that the fabry - perot modes far from the bragg frequency do not undergo bragg scattering and they just experience an increase of the mean losses . for the bragg mode , the threshold increases more than that of the other modes because bragg scattering introduces a feedback which interferences destructively with the one provided by the fabry - perot cavity . as @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> is increased up to @xmath81 all modes go below threshold and laser death is observed [ fig.(c ) and ( d ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> as the mean losses @xmath1 are further increased up to @xmath82 , laser revival is observed [ see fig.3(e ) and ( f ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> the revival is associated to the coalescence of the two longitudinal modes of the cavity nearest to the bragg frequency ( labelled by -1 and 1 in the figures ) , and their subsequent splitting along the imaginary axis ; see the arrows in fig.3 , which show the motion in the complex plane @xmath4 of the three poles 0 and @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> the coalescence and subsequent splitting of the poles resemble the ep scenario of ref.@xcite , however here the poles are resonance states and do not belong to the point spectrum of the hamiltonian like in ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> most importantly , as noticed in the previous case , i.e. for @xmath84 , loss - induced lasing is not at all associated with coalescence of poles in complex plane , i.e. loss - induced lasing is not an effect peculiar to eps .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> loss - induced lasing is not a new result in laser theory and it is not necessarily related to the physics of exceptional points . </S>",
    "<S> the interest on such an unusual behavior found in the recent literature seems over - emphasized . </S>",
    "<S> the experiment of ref.@xcite surely provides a nice realization in an integrated micro / nano - scale photonic system of some exotic properties of non - hermitian degeneracies , however it does not actually introduce any surprising physical effect into what we know in laser theory . </S>"
