    "our experiment is no exception , the large improvements being a direct result of the excellent stability of our cryogenic sapphire oscillator .",
    "additionally its operation at a microwave frequency allows a direct comparison to a hydrogen maser which provides a highly stable and reliable reference frequency .",
    "numerous test theories that allow the modeling and interpretation of experiments that test lli have been developed .",
    "kinematical frameworks @xcite postulate a simple parametrisation of the lorentz transformations with experiments setting limits on the deviation of those parameters from their special relativistic values .",
    "a more fundamental approach is offered by theories that parametrise the coupling between gravitational and non - gravitational fields ( th@xmath80 @xcite or @xmath81 g @xcite formalisms ) which allow the comparison of experiments that test different aspects of the eep .",
    "finally , formalisms based on string theory @xcite have the advantage of being well motivated by theories of physics that are at present the only candidates for a unification of gravity and the other fundamental forces of nature .",
    "owing to their simplicity the kinematical frameworks of @xcite have been widely used to model and interpret many previous experiments testing lli @xcite and we will follow that route .",
    "an analysis based on the more fundamental `` standard model extension '' ( sme ) @xcite is under way and will be published shortly .    by construction kinematical frameworks",
    "do not allow for any dynamical effects on the measurement apparatus .",
    "this implies that in all inertial frames two clocks of different nature ( e.g. based on different atomic species ) run at the same relative rate and two length standards made of different materials keep their relative lengths .",
    "coordinates are defined by the clocks and length standards , and only the transformations between those coordinate systems are modified . in general",
    "this leads to observable effects on light propagation in moving frames but , by definition , to no observable effects on clocks and length standards .",
    "in particular , no attempt is made at explaining the underlying physics ( e.g. modified maxwell and/or dirac equations ) that could lead to lorentz violating light propagation but leave e.g. atomic energy levels unchanged .",
    "on the other hand dynamical frameworks ( e.g. the th@xmath80 formalism or the sme ) in general use a modified general lagrangian that leads to modified maxwell and dirac equations and hence to lorentz violating light propagation and atomic properties , which is why they are considered more fundamental and more complete than the kinematical frameworks . furthermore ,",
    "as shown in @xcite , the sme is kept sufficiently general to , in fact , encompass the kinematical frameworks and some other dynamical frameworks ( in particular the th@xmath80 formalism ) as special cases , although there are no simple and direct relationships between the respective parameters .",
    "concerning our experiment the sme allows the calculation of lorentz violating effects on the fields inside the sapphire resonator , on the properties of the sapphire crystal itself and on the hydrogen maser transition .",
    "as shown in @xcite the effect on the sapphire crystal amounts to only a few percent of the direct effect on the fields , and @xcite show that the hydrogen @xmath82 clock transition is not affected to first order .",
    "hence the total effect is dominated by the lorentz violating properties of the electromagnetic fields inside the resonator which can be calculated following the principles laid down in @xcite .",
    "an analysis of our experiment in that framework is currently being carried out , and the results will be published elsewhere in the near future . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on the analysis using the kinematical framework of mansouri and sexl @xcite .",
    "kinematical frameworks for the description of lorentz violation have been pioneered by robertson @xcite and further refined by mansouri and sexl @xcite and others .",
    "fundamentally the different versions of these frameworks are equivalent , and relations between their parameters are readily obtained . as mentioned above these frameworks postulate generalized transformations between a preferred frame candidate @xmath83 and a moving frame @xmath84 where it is assumed that in both frames coordinates are realized by identical standards .",
    "we start from the transformations of @xcite ( in differential form ) for the case where the velocity of @xmath85 as measured in @xmath86 is along the positive x - axis , and assuming einstein synchronization in @xmath85 ( we will be concerned with signal travel times around closed loops so the choice of synchronization convention can play no role ) :    @xmath87    with @xmath8 the velocity of light in vacuum in @xmath86 . using the usual expansion of the three parameters @xmath88 , setting @xmath89 in @xmath86 , and transforming according to ( [ mstransf ] )",

    "and @xmath143 ) from a fit to each individual data set ( blue diamonds ) and a global fit to all the data ( red squares ) . for comparison our previously published results @xcite are also shown ( green triangles ) .",
    "the error bars indicate the combined uncertainties from statistics and systematic effects.,width=340 ]    systematic effects at diurnal or semi - diurnal frequencies with the appropriate phase could mask a putative sidereal signal .",
    "the statistical uncertainties of @xmath143 and @xmath142 obtained from the wls fit above correspond to sidereal and semi - sidereal terms ( from ( [ msdff2 ] ) ) of @xmath148 and @xmath149 respectively so any systematic effects exceeding these limits need to be taken into account in the final uncertainty .",
    "we expect the main contributions to such effects to arise from temperature , pressure and magnetic field variations that would affect the hydrogen maser , the cso and the associated electronics , and from tilt variations of the cso which are known to affect its frequency .",
    "measurements of the tilt variations of the cso show amplitudes of 4.6 @xmath141rad and 1.6 @xmath141rad at diurnal and semi - diurnal frequencies .    to estimate the tilt sensitivity we have intentionally tilted the oscillator by @xmath131 5 mrad off its average position which led to relative frequency variations of @xmath150 from which we deduce a tilt sensitivity of @xmath151rad@xmath79 . this value corresponds to a worst case scenario as we expect a quadratic rather than linear frequency variation for small tilts around the vertical .",
    "even with this pessimistic estimate diurnal and semi - diurnal frequency variations due to tilt do not exceed @xmath152 and @xmath153 respectively and are therefore negligible with respect to the statistical uncertainties .",
    "in december 2002 we implemented an active temperature stabilization inside an isolated volume ( @xmath154 ) that included the cso and all the associated electronics .",
    "the temperature was measured continously in two fixed locations ( behind the electronics rack and on top of the dewar ) . for the best data sets the measured temperature variations did not exceed 0.02/0.01 @xmath155c in amplitude for the diurnal and semi - diurnal components . in the worst cases ( the two 2002 data sets and some data sets taken during a partial air conditioning failure )",
    "the measured temperature variations could reach 0.26/0.08 @xmath155c . when intentionally heating and cooling the cso lab by @xmath156c we see frequency variations of @xmath157 per @xmath155c .",
    "this is also confirmed when we induce a large sinusoidal temperature variation ( @xmath158c amplitude ) . using this we can calculate a value for temperature induced frequency variations at diurnal and semi - diurnal frequencies for each data set , obtaining values that range from @xmath159 to @xmath160 .",
    "the hydrogen maser is kept in a dedicated , environmentally controlled clock room .",
    "measurements of magnetic field , temperature and atmospheric pressure in that room and the maser sensitivities as specified by the manufacturer allow us to exclude any systematic effects on the maser frequency that would exceed the statistical uncertainties above and the systematic uncertainties from temperature variations in the cso lab .",
    "our final uncertainties ( the error bars in fig . [ mmktfig2 ] ) are the quadratic sums of the statistical uncertainties from the wls adjustment for each data set and the systematic uncertainties calculated for each data set from ( [ msdff2 ] ) and the measured temperature variations . for the global adjustment we average the systematic uncertainties from the individual data sets obtaining @xmath161 on @xmath143 and @xmath162 on @xmath142 . adding these quadratically to the wls statistical uncertainties of the global adjustment we obtain as our final result @xmath163 and @xmath164 ( @xmath67 uncertainties ) .",
    "we have reported on two different tests of the einstein equivalence principle ( eep ) using the comparison of atomic clocks with different atomic species on one hand , and the comparison of an atomic clock and a cryogenic sapphire cavity oscillator on the other .",
    "the two experiments are interpreted as testing local position invariance ( lpi ) and local lorentz invariance ( lli ) respectively which are both constituent elements of the eep .",
    "the test of lpi is based on the comparison of the hyperfine transitions in @xmath0rb and @xmath1cs using atomic fountains that presently reach uncertainties of @xmath165 .",
    "such measurements were repeated over the last 5 years to search for a time variation that would indicate a violation of lpi .",
    "our present results limit a linear variation to @xmath166 which represents a 5-fold improvement over our previous results @xcite and a 100-fold improvement over the hg@xmath73-h hyperfine energy comparison @xcite . when interpreting the results as a limit on the time variation of fundamental constants ( c.f .",
    "2.1 ) we obtain @xmath167 where @xmath168 stands for @xmath169 . by itself",
    "this experiment limits the time variation of a combination of two of the three fundamental constants of sect .",
    "the @xmath3hg@xmath73 to @xmath1cs comparisons by the nist group @xcite provide @xmath170 where @xmath171 stands for @xmath172 . combining these two results we have two constraints on the variation of the three fundamental constants , with the missing third constraint requiring the comparison over time with a fourth atomic transition ( c.f .",
    "the test of lli is based on the comparison of a hydrogen maser clock to a cryogenic sapphire microwave cavity .",
    "this experiment simultaneously constrains two combinations of the three parameters of the mansouri and sexl test theory ( previously measured individually by michelson - morley and kennedy - thorndike experiments ) .",
    "we obtain @xmath173 which is of the same order as the best previous results @xcite , and @xmath174 which improves the best previous limit @xcite by a factor of 70 ( the first bracket indicates the @xmath67 uncertainty from statistics the second from systematic effects ) .",
    "we improve our own previous results @xcite by about a factor 2 due to more and longer data sets and to improved temperature control of the experiment .",
    "we note that our value on @xmath175 is compatible with the slightly significant recent result of @xcite who obtained @xmath176 .    as a result of our experiment",
    "the lorentz transformations are confirmed in this particular test theory with an overall uncertainty of @xmath177 limited now by the determination of @xmath105 from doppler and clock comparison experiments @xcite .",
    "this is likely to be improved in the coming years by experiments such as aces ( atomic clock ensemble in space @xcite ) that will compare ground clocks to clocks on the international space station aiming at a 10 fold improvement on the determination of @xmath105 .    in the future",
    ", the two tests of lpi and lli presented here are expected to further improve due to improvements in the accuracies of the atomic clocks involved and due to new experimental strategies , ultimately leading to space - borne versions of the experiments .",
    "ongoing efforts are expected to improve the accuracy of both @xmath0rb and @xmath1cs to the @xmath64 level .",
    "the corresponding limit to variations of fundamental constants will then be decreased to @xmath178  yr@xmath79 or less .",
    "recent advances in the field of optical frequency metrology will probably lead optical frequency standards to surpass microwave clocks .",
    "comparing such standards to each other will provide very stringent limits to the variation of the fine structure constant @xmath2 . to keep the constraints to the variation of @xmath29 and @xmath30 at the same level",
    ", further efforts and new methods will have to be invented to improve microwave clocks .",
    "these tests will also greatly benefit from a new generation of time / frequency transfer at the @xmath64 level which is currently under development for the esa space mission aces which will fly ultra - stable clocks on board the international space station in 2006 @xcite and a similar project conducted by nasa .",
    "these missions will allow highly precise comparisons between clocks developed in distant laboratories and based on different atomic species and/or different technologies .",
    "concerning the test of lli , new proposals have been made to use two orthogonal resonators or two orthogonal modes in the same sapphire resonator placed on a rotating platform @xcite .",
    "such a set - up is likely to improve the tests of lli by several orders of magnitude as the relevant time variations will now be at the rotation frequency ( @xmath179 hz ) which is the range in which such resonators are the most stable ( @xmath131 100 fold better stability ) .",
    "additionally many systematic effects are likely to cancel between the two orthogonal oscillators or modes and the remaining ones are likely to be less coupled to the rotation frequency than to the sidereal frequencies used in our experiment .",
    "ultimately , it has been proposed @xcite to conduct these tests on board an earth orbiting satellite , again with a potential gain of several orders of magnitudes over current limits .",
