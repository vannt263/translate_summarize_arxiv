    "study of the critical behaviour of the ising model has several attractions . on the one hand ,",
    "the ising - like models are simple enough , which is of a special advantage in the statistical physics . on the other hand , in spite of their simplicity ,",
    "such models show rich and interesting behaviour at the critical point .",
    "also , the existence of the exact solution for the two - dimensional ising model often makes it an object for verifying different approximation schemes .",
    "all the stated above yielded the high interest devoted to the problem .",
    "in particular a great deal of generalization of the model appeared . among different ways of generalization",
    ", much attention has been devoted to the affect of the impurities on the critical behaviour of the ising - like models as well as to the investigation of critical regimes of the models on the lattices of a non - integer dimension ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "there have been devised different realizations of the last stated generalization .",
    "for example , one can approach the concept of non - integer dimensionality either by explicit construction of the non - integer dimensional object , which leads to the concept of a fractal @xcite , or by formal carrying out an analytic continuation of the function , which by definition depends on a natural value of dimension .    within the theory of critical phenomena",
    "the latter ambiguity was reflected in examining the critical behaviour of the many - particle systems on fractal @xcite or on abstract hypercubic lattices of the non - integer @xmath3 .",
    "there arosed a question whether a model on a fractal lattice ( being scale invariant ) possesses universality as well as a system on a hypercubic lattice ( having translation invariance ) .",
    "the problem has been widely studied but still remains open @xcite . today",
    "s point of view states that the usual demand for  strong universality  ( in sense of critical properties depending only on symmetry of the order parameter , interaction range and space dimension ) seems not to be obeyed by fractal lattice systems , and for them the concept of universality itself should be revised @xcite .",
    "speaking about the study of ising - like models on analytically continued hypercubic lattices of non - integer @xmath3 , one should note a great variety of theoretical approaches devised for these problems .",
    "these include : the wilson - fisher @xmath9-expansion @xcite improved by the summation method @xcite ; kadanoff lower - bound renormalization applied to some special non - integer dimensions @xcite ; high - temperature expansion improved by a variation technique @xcite ; finite - size scaling method applied to numerical transfer - matrices data @xcite ; new perturbation theory based on the physical branch of the solution of the renormalization group equation @xcite ; fixed dimension renormalization group technique @xcite applied directly to arbitrary non - integer @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "perhaps the first paper devoted to the study of the ising model in different , however not non - integer dimension , was @xcite where non - universal properties of the model were discussed .",
    "all these approaches , as well as the computer simulations , confirm the correctness of the universality hypothesis also for non - integer @xmath3 hypercubic lattices and allow to obtain the critical exponents as functions of @xmath3 with high accuracy .    in spite of the variety of approaches to treat the general non - integer @xmath3 case @xcite the results for the ising model critical exponents obtained on their basis lay close to each other ; the above mentioned analytic continuations may appear actually equivalent .",
    "note , however , that the analytic continuation in @xmath10 at general non - integer dimension leads to the fail of the yang - lee theorem @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the study of ising - like spin systems on non - integer dimension hypercubic lattices can not be reduced to the fractal lattice systems @xcite except for the case of vanishing lacunarity limit @xcite and thus is the task of individual interest .",
    "returning to the study of the critical behaviour at integer @xmath3 , one should note that the problem becomes more complicated when studying spin systems with a structural disorder .",
    "whereas the case of the annealed disorder is of less interest from the point of view of determining asymptotical values of critical exponents @xcite , the weak * quenched * disorder has been a subject of intensive study . here",
    "the harris criterion @xcite has been devised .",
    "it states that if the heat capacity exponent @xmath11 of a pure model is negative , that is the heat capacity has no divergence at the critical point , impurities do not affect the critical behaviour of the model in the sense that critical exponents remain unchanged under dilution . only in the case",
    "@xmath12 , the critical behaviour of the disordered model is governed by a _ new set of critical exponents_. as far as for a @xmath13 @xmath7-vector spin model only the @xmath13 ising model ( @xmath4 ) is characterized by @xmath14 , it is the ising model which is of special interest . and because of the triviality of the annealed disorder in the sense mentioned above ,",
    "the most interesting object for study is just the quenched ising model .",
    "the appearance of a set of new critical exponents for that model at @xmath15 is confirmed by the experiments @xcite , renormalization group @xmath16 calculations @xcite , monte - carlo @xmath17 @xcite and @xmath18 @xcite simulations .",
    "the situation is not so simple for the @xmath19 ising model .",
    "onsager exact solution of the pure model proves the logarithmic divergence of heat capacity , which yields @xmath20 , and allows one , in accordance with the harris criterion , to clasify this case as a marginal one .",
    "most of the theoretical works suggest that the @xmath19 ising model with a quenched disorder has the same critical behaviour as the @xmath19 pure ising model ( except for logarithmic corrections ) @xcite ( see also review @xcite ) .",
    "this result is corroborated by @xmath21-simulations on two - dimensional lattices @xcite and experiments @xcite .",
    "deviations from the expected critical exponents , which sometimes are observed during such computations , are explained by a system being not in the asymptotic region ( see @xcite for recent study ) .",
    "nevertheless , some authors assert that for the @xmath19 ising model with a quenched disorder a new critical behaviour appears @xcite    while the undiluted ising model at non - integer @xmath3 was a subject of intensive study @xcite , it is not the case for the diluted ising model . only the work @xcite can be mentioned here , where the model was studied within the golner - riedel scaling field @xcite approach .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that the @xmath22-expansion technique applied to this model , due to the fact that @xmath23-equations appear to be degenerated on the one loop level , results in @xmath24-expansion for the critical exponents @xcite .",
    "the latter is known up to the three - loop order @xcite .",
    "the equations of the massive field theory at fixed integer @xmath3 @xcite first applied to the diluted ising model at @xmath25 in @xcite were found to be the most effective method for investigating this problem . in order to consider",
    "an arbitrary non - integer @xmath3 the parisi approach @xcite was generalized in @xcite where critical behaviour of the model was studied in a two - loop approximation .",
    "the aim of the present work , based on the massive field theoretical approach , is to make a more detailed investigation of the critical behaviour of the diluted @xmath26-vector model at arbitrary @xmath3 .",
    "though it is the case @xmath4 in which we are interested most of all , we consider the @xmath23-equations for any @xmath7 , which also allow us to study the crossover in the model at any @xmath3 .",
    "we will obtain the @xmath23-equations within the 3-loop approximation and apply to their analysis different resummation procedures in order to find the most reliable one .",
    "the set - up of the article is as follows . in the next section we introduce the model and the notation .",
    "then we describe the @xmath23-procedure adopted here and give the series for the @xmath23-functions of the weakly diluted quenched @xmath7-vector model in the three - loop approximation .",
    "being asymptotic , these series are to be resummed .",
    "this is done in section 2 where different ways of resummation are used .",
    "section 3 concludes our study giving results for the quantitative characteristics of the critical behaviour and discussing them . in the conclusions we give some general comments to the present work . in the appendix we list some lengthy expressions for the coefficients of the @xmath23-functions in the three - loop approximation",
    "as it is well known , the critical behaviour of the quenched weakly - diluted @xmath7  -  vector model is governed by a lagrangian with two coupling constants @xcite : @xmath27 + { v_{0}\\over 4 ! } \\left(\\sum_{\\alpha=1}^{n}|\\vec{\\phi}^\\alpha|^2 \\right)^2 + \\nonumber \\\\ \\label{2.1 } & & { u_{0}\\over 4 ! } \\sum_{\\alpha=1}^{n}\\left(|\\vec{\\phi}^\\alpha|^2 \\right)^2 \\big\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in replica limit @xmath28 . here",
    "any @xmath29 is a @xmath7-component vector + @xmath30 ; @xmath31 are bare coupling constants ; @xmath32 is bare mass .",
    "as it was already stated above , we adopt here the massive field theory renormalization scheme @xcite in order to extract the critical behaviour governed by ( [ lagrangian ] ) .",
    "we start from the defined by ( [ lagrangian ] ) unrenormalized one - particle irreducible vertex functions @xmath33 depending on the wave vectors @xmath34 , bare parameters @xmath35 and the ultraviolet momentum cutoff @xmath36 .",
    "the vertex functions dependence on the space dimension @xmath3 is explicitly noted here as well .",
    "we impose the renormalization conditions at zero external momenta and non - zero mass ( see @xcite for instance ) at the limit @xmath37 for the renormalized functions @xcite @xmath38 :    @xmath39    with @xmath40 being the renormalized mass @xmath41 and couplings @xmath42 . from these conditions there follow expansions for the renormalized constants for field @xmath43 , vertices @xmath44 @xmath45 , @xmath46 @xmath47 and @xmath48 insertion @xmath49 .",
    "subsequently , these define the coefficients @xmath50 entering the corresponding callan - symanzik equation : @xmath51 to be defined by simultaneous zero of both @xmath0-functions : @xmath52 the @xmath53-function gives the critical exponent @xmath54 of the pair correlation function : @xmath55    the correlation length critical exponent @xmath56 is defined in the stable fixed point by :    @xmath57    using familiar scaling relations , one can easily calculate any other critical exponents on the base of @xmath54 and @xmath56 .    applying the described above procedure ,",
    "one obtains in the three - loop approximation @xcite @xmath0- and @xmath1-functions in the form @xcite : @xmath58 u^2 + \\frac{96}{(m+8)(mn+8 ) } \\times \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\big [ ( m+5)(i_1-\\frac{1}{2})+ \\frac{m+2}{6 } i_2 \\big ] uv + \\frac{24}{(mn+8)^2 } \\times \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\big [ ( mn+14)(i_1-\\frac{1}{2 } ) + \\frac{mn+2}{3 } i_2 \\big ] v^2 + \\beta_u^{(3la ) } + \\dots \\big \\ } \\\\ \\label{beta_v } \\beta_v(u , v ) & = & -(4-d ) v \\big \\ { 1 - v - \\frac{2(m+2)}{m+8 } u + \\frac{8}{(mn+8)^2 } \\times \\\\ & & \\big [ ( 5mn+22)(i_1-\\frac{1}{2})+(mn+2 ) i_2 \\big ] v^2 + \\frac{96(m+2)}{(m+8)(mn+8 ) } \\times \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\big [ i_1-\\frac{1}{2 } + \\frac{i_2}{6}\\big ] uv + \\frac{24(m+2)}{(m+8)^2 } \\big [ i_1-\\frac{1}{2 } + \\frac{i_2}{3 } \\big ] u^2 + \\beta_v^{(3la ) } + \\dots \\big \\ }",

    "the values for the three - loop integrals @xmath62 which appear in three - loop coefficients for integer @xmath63 are listed in @xcite . in particular , substituting loop integrals @xmath64 as well as @xmath65 in ( [ beta_u])-([gamma ] ) by their values at @xmath15 we get at @xmath66 the corresponding functions of the @xmath13 weakly diluted ising model , which in the 3-loop approximation were obtained in @xcite . at @xmath15 , @xmath67- arbitrary corresponding expressions",
    "coincide with those , obtained for the @xmath13 anisotropic @xmath2-vector model in @xcite .",
    "our idea is to keep the dimensional dependence of the loop integrals and , being based on their numerical values for arbitrary @xmath3 @xcite , to study the @xmath68-model at arbitrary ( non - integer ) @xmath3 as well .",
    "but for the reason explained above , the point of main interest here will be the replica limit @xmath5 of the anisotropic @xmath2-vector model , especially the case @xmath4 .",
    "expressions for @xmath0- and @xmath1-functions will be the starting point for the qualitative study of the main features of the critical behaviour which will be done in the next section .",
    "as we have already mentioned , the values of the @xmath1-functions in a fixed point @xmath69 lead to the values of the critical exponents @xmath54 and @xmath56 .",
    "however , it is well known now that the series for @xmath23-functions are of asymptotic nature @xcite and imply the corresponding resummation procedure to extract reliable data on their basis .",
    "let us note , however , that as to our knowledge the asymptotic nature of the series for @xmath23-functions have been proved only for the case of the model with one coupling @xcite , and the application of a resummation procedure to the case of several coupling constants is based rather on general belief than on a proved fact .",
    "one of the resummation procedures , which in different modifications is most commonly used in the studies of asymptotic series , is known as the integral borel transformation @xcite .",
    "however , this technique implies explicit knowledge of the general term of a series and thus can not be applied here , where only truncated sums of the series are known . to get over this obstacle one",
    "represents the so - called borel - leroy image of the initial sum in the form of a rational approximant and in such a way reconstitutes the general term of the series .",
    "the technique which involves a rational approximation and the borel transformation together , is known as the pad - borel resummation technique ( in the field - theoretical @xmath23 content see @xcite as an example of its application ) .",
    "note here that the resummation technique , based on the conformal mapping , which is widely used in the theory of critical phenomena @xcite , can not be applied in our case because its application postulates information on the high order behaviour of the series for @xmath0- and @xmath1-functions .",
    "the latter is still unknown for the theory with the lagrangian ( [ lagrangian ] ) .    to summarize up the stated",
    "let us write that the pad - borel resummation is performed as follows :    * constructing the borel - leroy image of the initial sum @xmath70 of @xmath59 terms : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the euler s gamma function and @xmath73 is an arbitrary non - negative number .",
    "the special cases @xmath74 and @xmath75 correspond to resumming @xmath0-functions without or with prefactors @xmath44 and @xmath46 in accordance with the structure of the functions ( [ beta_u])-([beta_v ] ) ; * the borel - leroy image ( [ leroy ] ) is extrapolated by a rational approximant @xmath76 ( xt)$ ] , where by @xmath76 $ ] one means the quotient of two polynomials ; @xmath77 is the order of the numerator and @xmath78 is that of the denominator ; * the resummed function @xmath79 is obtained in the form : @xmath80 ( xt).\\ ] ]    in the two variables case only the first step is changed ; namely , here we define the borel - leroy image as @xmath81 generalization to the many - variable case is trivial .",
    "now one can take into account that the second step of the stated scheme can be done in different ways .",
    "one can write down various pad approximants in the variable @xmath82 to obtain within the three - loop approximation the expressions of the structure @xmath83 $ ] , @xmath84 $ ] and @xmath85 $ ] .",
    "it is also possible to use chisholm approximants @xcite in the variables @xmath44 and @xmath46 , which , generally speaking , in the same number of loops can be of type @xmath86 $ ] , @xmath87 $ ] , @xmath88 $ ] and @xmath89 $ ] , but the explicit definition of any approximant needs some additional equations now @xcite .",
    "the technique , which involves chisholm approximation together with the integral borel transformation is referred to as the chisholm - borel resummation technique . to be consistent , one would have to apply the all different resummation frameworks in order to obtain reliable results on their basis and find which of the methods is the most effective .",
    "however , strong restriction on the number of choices can be imposed .",
    "first of all , an approximant should be chosen in the form reconstituting the sign - alternating high - order behaviour of the general term of @xmath0- and @xmath1-functions , which was confirmed in the particular case @xmath4 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 @xcite .",
    "the approximant generating a sign - alternating series might be chosen in a form @xmath92 $ ] with the positive coefficients at the variable @xmath82 ( or @xmath44 and @xmath46 ) . choosing an approximant with a non - linear denominator , generally speaking , one does not ensure the desired properties .",
    "direct calculations affirm the argumentation : @xmath0-functions , resummed with the pad - borel and the chisholm - borel methods with approximants @xmath76 , n>1 $ ] , for @xmath93 give the roots which lie far from the expected values which for @xmath15 are known up to the order of four loops @xcite and for general @xmath3 were calculated from the two - loop @xmath0-functions @xcite .",
    "this is true for any @xmath73 .",
    "the stated results permit us to eliminate from the consideration approximants with a non - linear denominator .",
    "note as well that choosing representation of the @xmath23-functions ( [ beta_u])-([gamma ] ) in the form of pad or chisholm approximant of type @xmath94 $ ] might result in the appearance of a pole in the expression .",
    "here we use an analytical continuation of the resulting expressions by evaluating the principal value of the integral . treating the task in this way one",
    "notes that the topological structure of the lines of zeros for the resummed by the pad - borel technique @xmath0-functions is very different in the region near the solution for the mixed fixed point and strongly irregular when passing through the number of loops .",
    "in particular this yields that in the three - loop approximation there exist two solutions close to the expected value of the mixed fixed point . to compare",
    ", the results obtained within the frames of the chisholm - borel method do not have these faults and are more stable from the point of view of proceeding in number of loops .",
    "so , the results given below are obtained by the chisholm - borel method applied to the approximant of type @xmath86 $ ] . in order to determine the form of this approximant",
    "completely one must define two additional conditions .",
    "the approximants are expected to be symmetric in variables @xmath44 and @xmath46 , otherwise the properties of the symmetry related to these variables would depend , except for the properties of the lagrangian , on the method of calculation . by the substitution",
    "@xmath95 all the equations which describe the critical behaviour of the diluted model are converted into appropriate equations of the pure model .",
    "however , if pure model is solved independently , the resummation technique with the application of pad approximant is used .",
    "thus , chisholm approximant is to be chosen in such a way that , by putting any of @xmath44 or @xmath46 equal to zero , one obtains pad approximant for a one - variable case .",
    "this also implies a special choice of additional conditions . in the present study",
    "amidst all the possible expressions which satisfy the stated demand we choose chisholm approximant @xmath86 $ ] by putting coefficients at @xmath96 and @xmath97 to be equal to zero .",
    "now we are going to apply the mathematical framework which was discussed in previous sections in order to obtain numerical characteristics of the critical behaviour of the weakly - diluted ising model in general dimensions .",
    "it was noted in the section 1 that the critical behaviour of the quenched weakly - diluted ising model is described by the effective lagrangian ( [ lagrangian ] ) in the case @xmath4 and zero replica limit @xmath5 .",
    "namely , the task in the end comes to obtaining fixed points which are defined by simultaneous zero of the both @xmath0-functions . among all the possible fixed points",
    "one is interested only in those in the ranges @xmath98 and only in stable ones where the stability means that two eigenvalues @xmath99 of the stability matrix @xmath100 , @xmath101 are positive or possess positive real parts .",
    "the structure of the @xmath0-functions ( [ beta_u])-([beta_v ] ) yields the possibility of four solutions for the fixed points .",
    "the first two @xmath102 and @xmath103 in our case at @xmath104 are out of physical interest , while the second pair which consists of pure @xmath105 and mixed @xmath106 points , are responsible for two possible critical regimes .",
    "the critical behaviour of the diluted model coincides with that of the pure model when the pure fixed point appears to be stable .",
    "if the mixed point is stable , the _ new _ ( diluted ) critical behaviour of the system takes place .",
    "the type of the critical behaviour depends on the number @xmath7 of the order parameter components and on the dimensionality @xmath3 : at any @xmath107 a system with large enough @xmath7 is not sensitive to the weak dilution in the sense that asymptotic values of critical exponents do not change ; only starting from some marginal value @xmath6 , at @xmath108 a mixed fixed point becomes stable and the crossover to the random critical behaviour occurs .",
    "the problem of determining @xmath6 as a function of @xmath3 will be discussed later .",
    "now we would like to state that @xmath109 for any @xmath110 , and thus just the mixed fixed point governs the asymptotic critical behaviour of the diluted ising model .",
    "if one attempts to find the fixed points from the @xmath0-functions ( [ beta_u])-([beta_v ] ) without resummation , there always appears only the gaussian @xmath102 trivial solution ; the existence of the rest possible three fixed points depends on the concrete details of the @xmath0-functions portions in the braces in expressions ( [ beta_u])-([beta_v ] ) . in a @xmath13 case",
    "it appears that without a resummation the non - trivial mixed fixed point does not exist in one- , two- and four - loop approximations @xcite .",
    "it is only the three - loop approximation where all the four solutions of the set of equations ( [ fixedpoint ] ) exist @xcite . in figure [ fig1 ]",
    "we show the behaviour of the non - resummed @xmath0-functions of the three - dimensional weakly diluted ising model in the three - loop approximation .",
    "resummed functions are shown in the same approximation in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "note that in this approximation the shape of the functions remains alike in the region of small couplings @xmath44 and @xmath46 .",
    "fixed points correspond to the crossing of the lines @xmath111 as it is demonstrated in figures [ fig3 ] , [ fig4 ] .",
    "the left - hand column in figures [ fig3 ] , [ fig4 ] shows the lines of zeros of non - resummed @xmath0-functions in three - dimensions in one- , two- , three- and four - loop ( results of @xcite ) approximations .",
    "one can see in the figures that without resummation all non - trivial solutions are obtained only within the three - loop level of the perturbation theory . in the next order",
    "all fixed points disappear which is a strong evidence of their accidental origin . at any arbitrary @xmath3 , @xmath8 the qualitative behaviour of the functions is very similar to that shown in figures [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] .",
    "as it has already been mentioned , in order to reestablish the lost pure and mixed points one applies the resummation procedure to @xmath0-functions . in the three - dimensional space",
    "the result of resummation is illustrated by the right - hand column in figures [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] .",
    "here we have used the chisholm - borel resummation technique choosing chisholm approximant in the form discussed in the previous section with @xmath75 in successive approximation in the number of loops .",
    "the icons in the figures which correspond to a one - loop level are the visual proof of the degeneracy of the @xmath0-functions in this order of the perturbation theory : the plots of root - lines are parallel independently of resummation .",
    "the rest three images in the right - hand columns are a good graphic demonstration of the reliability of the chisholm - borel resummational method : two- , three- and four - loop pictures are quantitatively similar , the coordinates of the pure and mixed point are close .",
    "the numerical results of our study are given in table [ table1 ] . here , the coordinates of the stable mixed fixed point and the values of the critical exponents of the quenched weakly diluted ising model are listed as functions of @xmath3 between @xmath112 and @xmath113 . the eigenvalues @xmath114 and @xmath115 of the stability matrix",
    "are given as well .",
    "it was already noted that the values of @xmath1-functions in a stable point yield the numerical characteristics of the critical behaviour of the model .",
    "for example , given the resummed functions @xmath116 and @xmath117 , the pair of equations @xmath118 allows us to find the exponents @xmath54 and @xmath56 .",
    "all other exponents can be obtained from the familiar scaling laws .",
    "however , one can proceed in a different way .",
    "that is , by means of the scaling laws it is possible to reconstitute the expansion in coupling constants of any exponent of interest or of any combination of exponents , and only after that to apply the resummation procedure .",
    "if exact calculation were performed the answer would not depend on the sequence of operations .",
    "however , this is not the case for the present approximate calculations .",
    "we have chosen the scheme of computing where the resummation procedure was applied to the combination @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "the exponents @xmath121 , @xmath0 and @xmath54 have been calculated on the basis of numerical values of the exponents @xmath1 and @xmath56 .",
    "the resummation scheme appears to be quite insensitive to the choice of the parameter @xmath73 given by ( [ leroy ] ) , ( [ p ] ) .",
    "however note , that computations have been performed here , as well as in @xcite , with @xmath75 .",
    "comparing our data from table [ table1 ] for the critical exponents at @xmath112 with the results for the pure ising model one can see that the exponent @xmath1 differs from the exact value @xmath122 by the order of @xmath123 , the exponent @xmath56 is smaller from the exact value @xmath124 less than by @xmath125 .",
    "this confirm the conjecture that the critical behaviour of the weakly diluted quenched ising model at @xmath112 within logarithmic correction coincide with that of the pure model ( see @xcite for review ) .",
    "it is also interesting to compare numbers given in table [ table1 ] with those obtained for general @xmath3 within the 2-loop approximation @xcite : all the exponents of the three - loop level lie slightly farther from the expected exact values of onsager than those of the two - loop approximation .",
    "this may be explained by the oscillatory nature of approaching to the exact values depending on the order of the perturbation theory .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the two - loop approximation yields better estimates for the heat capacity critical exponent @xmath121 for all @xmath3 in the range under consideration .",
    "namely , in accordance with the harris criterion , the exponent @xmath121 for the diluted ising system should remain negative .",
    "this picture is confirmed much better by the two - loop approximation where @xmath121 is negative in the whole range of @xmath3 , unlike the three - loop level of the perturbation theory , the results of which yield @xmath126 for @xmath127 .",
    "however , table [ table1 ] shows that the next ( third ) order does improve our understanding of the critical behaviour of the model in general dimensions .",
    "the results of the two - loop calculations @xcite show that starting from some marginal space dimension the approach to the stable point becomes oscillatory : the eigenvalues @xmath114 and @xmath115 turn to be complex possessing positive real parts .",
    "this is an artifact of the calculation scheme and therefore it was expected @xcite that by increasing the accuracy of calculations one decreases the region of @xmath3 which corresponds to the complex eigenvalues .",
    "it is really the case . in the three - loop approximation the region of complex @xmath128",
    "is bounded from below by @xmath129 , whereas in the two - loop approximation @xcite the corresponding value is lower and is equal to @xmath130 .",
    "thus , the region of @xmath3 characterized by the oscillatory approach to the stable fixed point shrinks with the increase of the order of the perturbation theory .",
    "the comparison of the three - dimensional value of @xmath56 with the four - loop result @xcite @xmath131 gives the accuracy of @xmath132 for our computations ( compare with @xmath133 for two - loops , where the value @xmath134 was obtained ) .",
    "thus , it may be stated that the general accuracy of calculations decreases when passing from @xmath135 to @xmath112 which , in particular , results from the fact that our approach is asymptotically exact at upper critical dimension @xmath135 .",
    "the comparison of the present results with the other data available is provided by figure [ fig5 ] . here , the behaviour of the correlation length critical exponent @xmath56 obtained by different methods is demonstrated in general dimensions .",
    "the results of the massive field - theoretical scheme are plotted by solid ( three - loop approximation ; the present paper ) and dashed ( two - loop approximation ; ref .",
    "@xcite ) lines .",
    "one can see that the two lines practically coincide far enough from @xmath112 , in particular , both lie very close to the most accurate result for @xmath15 @xcite which is shown by the box .",
    "the application of the scaling - field method @xcite yields numbers shown in figure [ fig5 ] by stars .",
    "the limit from below ( @xmath136 ) of the method applicability is caused by the truncation of the set of scaling - field equations , which was considered in @xcite .",
    "one can also attempt to obtain some results by resumming the @xmath24-expansion which is known for the diluted ising model up to three - loop order @xcite and for the exponents @xmath56 and @xmath54 reads : @xmath137 where @xmath138 is rieman s zeta function .",
    "the corresponding results are shown by open diamonds .",
    "they were obtained by applying the pad - borel resummation scheme to the series of @xmath24- expansion ( [ nu_sqrteps ] ) @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath56 obtained in such a way is of physical interest only very close to @xmath135 . even in the next orders of the expansions the values of critical exponents",
    "are not improved @xcite ; this is an evidence of the @xmath24-expansion unreliability in tasks like the one under consideration . to compare",
    ", one can state that the situation with the applied in the present paper theoretical scheme is contrary to the @xmath24-expansion .",
    "while the two - loop approximation is valid in ranges @xmath139 , the next order of the perturbation theory enlarges the upper bound up to @xmath113 .",
    "one can expect that the next steps within the perturbation theory will allow one to obtain the description of the critical behaviour of the model with enough accuracy for any @xmath3 , @xmath8 .",
    "let us recall now that expressions ( [ beta_u])-([gamma ] ) for the @xmath23-functions , as well as their three - loop parts listed in the appendix , allow us to study asymptotic critical properties of the @xmath2-vector model with arbitrary @xmath7 and @xmath59 in arbitrary @xmath3 not only for the case @xmath4 , @xmath5 . in particular , by keeping @xmath7 as an arbitrary number and putting @xmath5 one can obtain the numerical estimates for the marginal order parameter component number @xmath6 which divides the diluted ( governed by the mixed fixed point ) asymptotic critical behaviour from the pure one , when the @xmath26-symmetric fixed point remains stable .",
    "in accordance with the harris criterion the case @xmath140 corresponds to zero of the heat capacity critical exponent @xmath121 of the model .",
    "one may extract the value of @xmath6 from this condition .",
    "however , the above discussed results of the three - loop approximation do not yield enough accuracy for @xmath121 .",
    "alternatively , the fixed mixed point should coincide with the pure fixed point at @xmath140 , which in particular means that @xmath141 .",
    "the last condition was chosen as a basis of our calculation .",
    "the appropriate numbers of the present three - loop approximation ( thick solid line ) together with the data of the two - loop approximation ( dashed line ) @xcite are shown in figure [ fig6 ] .",
    "the result of @xmath22-expansion @xmath142 is depicted by the thin solid line . in the three - loop approximation",
    "we obtain @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "these values are to be compared with the exact results of onsager which yield @xmath145 at @xmath112 , and the theoretical estimate @xmath146 @xcite .",
    "one can see that the two - loop results are closer to the expected values for both @xmath112 and @xmath15 .",
    "for a two - dimensional case the two - loop value @xmath147 @xcite differs from the exact one by @xmath148 , while the three - loop number decreases the accuracy to @xmath149 .",
    "the case @xmath150 contradicts the suggestion that the @xmath151-model asymptotic critical behaviour should not change under dilution in three - dimensions .",
    "the reason for decreasing the calculation accuracy with increasing the order of the perturbation theory may lie in oscillatory approach to the exact result .",
    "one can expect that already the four - loop case will improve the estimates for @xmath6 for all @xmath152 .",
    "let us also note that the determination of @xmath6 may serve as a test for improving the resummation scheme .",
    "the goal of this paper is to study the critical behaviour of the weakly diluted quenched ising model in the case when the space dimension @xmath3 continuously changes from @xmath112 to @xmath135 .",
    "as it was mentioned in the introduction , the study of the pure ising model at arbitrary @xmath3 , which corresponds to a scalar field - theoretical model with one coupling constant , is the subject of a great deal of papers .",
    "it is not the case for the model with a more complicated symmetry . in particular , here we study a model with two couplings corresponding to terms of different symmetry in the lagrangian ( [ lagrangian ] ) .",
    "such a problem was studied previously on the basis of the scaling - field method @xcite , and field - theoretical fixed dimension renormalization group calculations within a two - loop level of the perturbation theory are available @xcite .",
    "our calculations hold within the theoretical scheme of @xcite .",
    "this approach appears to be one amidst other possible calculation schemes for many tasks ; however , in our case it seems to have no alternatives within the field - theoretical approach .",
    "being asymptotic , the resulting series for the @xmath23-functions are to be resummed . in the present study we have chosen the pad - borel and the chisholm - borel resummation techniques . restricting ourselves to analytic expressions for the resummed functions , we present numerical data mainly obtained on the basis of the chisholm - borel resummation technique .",
    "note that the absence of any information on the high - order behaviour of the obtained series for the @xmath23-functions does not allow one to apply other resummation schemes , e.g. those based on the conformal mapping technique @xcite .",
    "the quantitative description of the critical behaviour of the model is steady from the point of view of passing from the two- to the three - loop approximation .",
    "smaller agreement between the two- and the three - loop approximations at @xmath3 far away from @xmath135 may be explained in a way that the precision of computing falls down with the increase of the expansion parameter which takes place at decrease of @xmath3 .",
    "the real parts of eigenvalues corresponding to the mixed point seem to remain positive up to @xmath135 , which testifies that at arbitrary @xmath3 the weakly diluted quenched ising model is described by the mixed fixed point .",
