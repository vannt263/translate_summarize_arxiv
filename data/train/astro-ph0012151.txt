    "measurement of anisotropy on the largest angular scales reveals the primordial distribution of matter ( @xcite ) .",
    "structures which came into the horizon and were able to collapse near the epoch of recombination lead to anisotropy at degree angular scales . the resulting cmb anisotropy angular power spectrum at these scales is highly sensitive to the parameters of the cosmological model",
    ". measurements of degree scale anisotropy have been made , for example , to constrain the curvature of the universe ( @xcite ) .",
    "the anisotropy on smaller angular scales , less than a few arcminutes , will be exponentially damped to vanishingly small levels due to photon diffusion and from the finite thickness of the ` surface ' of last scattering ( @xcite ) . at arcminute scales",
    ", so - called secondary anisotropy generated by the reionization of the universe and the sunyaev - zeldovich effect from galaxy clusters should dominate the primary signal ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "in this paper we report results from our ongoing program using the berkeley illinois maryland association ( bima ) interferometer to search for arcminute - scale cmb anisotropy .",
    "discussion of the instrument , data reduction , bayesian maximum likelihood analysis , expected signals ( from both primary and secondary anisotropies ) and comparison with previous experiments is included in the release of our earlier results ( @xcite ) .",

    "[ sec : con ] , we summarize the results of the survey .",
    "we have used the bima array at 28.5  ghz during the summers of 1997 , 1998 and 2000 to search for cmb anisotropy . we observed seven independent fields over the course of the first two summers . in two of these fields we found apparent detections of excess power .",
    "we extended our observations of those two fields in the summer of 2000 and also added four new fields to the survey .      for observations in the summer of 2000 , we selected four new fields , each located within @xmath9 of one of the fields selected in 1998 .",
    "we employed such a strategy to make efficient use of observing time allowing a six hour separation between fields as in the 1998 survey , and to search for systematic errors which could have resulted in false detections in our previous observations .",
    "the new fields were chosen to lie in regions of low dust emission and contrast as determined from examination of iras @xmath10 m maps .",
    "the vla nvss  ( @xcite ) and first  ( @xcite ) surveys were then used to select regions free of bright point sources at @xmath11ghz .",
    "in addition , we used the skyview digitized sky survey and rosat wfc maps to check for bright optical or x - ray emission which could complicate follow - up observations .",
    "the pointing centers for each of the six fields observed in the summer of 2000 are given in table 1 .",
    "all anisotropy observations were made using the bima array at hat creek .",
    "the array consisists of nine @xmath12 meter telescopes operating at @xmath13ghz , each with a @xmath0 fwhm primary beam . in order to track the system gains ,",
    "each @xmath14 minute source observation was bracketed by a @xmath15 minute observation of a calibrator .",
    "the fluxes of the calibration sources are all referenced to the flux of mars which is uncertain by approximately @xmath16 at @xmath17 confidence ( see discussion in @xcite ) . of the total time spent observing ,",
    "@xmath18 was spent on source .",
    "the cumulative integration times for each of the 6 fields observed in 2000 are listed in table 1 .",
    "combined with the observations described in @xcite , a total of 470 hours of on - source integration have been dedicated to this project .",
    "the compact configuration used for the 2000 summer bima anisotropy observations produced high brightness sensitivity but lacked the spatial dynamic range to distinguish point sources from cmb fluctuations . to constrain the contribution from point sources to our anisotropy measurements",
    ", we therefore used the very large array ( vla ) to survey each of the new fields as well as two of the 1998 fields which lacked point source observations .",
    "the @xmath19ghz vla observations were obtained within a month of the 2000 summer bima observations . with an hour and a half of observing time per field",
    ", we reached an rms flux of @xmath20jy at the center of a @xmath21 fwhm region centered on each of the blank fields observed with bima .    in the @xmath22 fields examined with the vla",
    ", we found @xmath23 point sources with fluxes adjusted for the attenuation of the primary beam ranging from @xmath24jy to @xmath25jy .",
    "the average flux of these point sources was @xmath26jy .    the point source model at @xmath27 ghz",
    "is extrapolated from the lower frequency vla data by assuming a spectral index of @xmath28 where @xmath29 ( @xcite ) . after accounting for attenuation due to the bima primary beam ,",
    "all of the point sources detected with the vla are expected to be near or below the measured rms flux density achieved in the bima blank field data .",
    "we have produced and analyzed images for each of the observed fields .",
    "the statistics of the images produced with only the short baselines used in the likelihood analysis are listed in table 2 . the observed rms values are comparable to those expected from the noise properties of the visibilities .",
    "we also express our results in terms of the rms rayleigh - jeans ( rj ) temperature fluctuations .",
    "we use the method described in holzapfel ( 2000 ) to determine the relative likelihoods that the observed fields are described by a model for the cmb fluctuations with flat band power @xmath30 .",
    "we present the results of the data analysis of the bima data both with and without the subtraction of the point sources extrapolated from the vla observations . in table 3",
    ", we show the most likely @xmath30 for each of the fields observed in the summer of 2000 with no point source subtraction .",
    "figure  [ fig : indiv ] shows the relative likelihoods as a function of assumed @xmath30 in each of the fields observed in the summer of 2000 with no point source subtraction .",
    "the results are normalized to unity likelihood for the case of no anisotropy signal .",
    "note that the results for fields bdf6 and bdf7 as displayed in both table 3 and figure  [ fig : indiv ] also include the data collected in the summer of 1998 .",
    "we estimate the point source contribution to the bima results by extrapolating the flux of point sources detected with the vla at @xmath31 ghz to the @xmath27 ghz bima observation frequency assuming spectral index @xmath32 .",
    "these sources are then removed from the raw data by taking the fourier transform of the point source model modulated by the primary beam response and subtracting it directly from the visibility data . in figure",
    "[ fig : all ] , we plot the combined likelihood for all of the fields under three assumptions for subtracted point source model ; no point sources , extrapolated fluxes assuming @xmath28 , and a flat spectrum ( @xmath33 ) for all sources . in table",
    "[ tab : qflat ] , we list the @xmath5 and @xmath8 confidence intervals in @xmath30 for each of the three point source extrapolations we have considered .",
    "the results are identical before and after the subtraction of the source fluxes estimated assuming @xmath28 . assuming a flat spectrum , the most likely @xmath30 slightly increases indicating that we have overestimated the flux of the point sources and by subtracting these sources we are adding excess power to the bima data .",
    "it is clear that point sources can not account for the detected excess power .    again , as found in holzapfel ( 2000 ) , the joint likelihood for all the data , shown in figure  [ fig : all ] , peaks at @xmath34 .",
    "while the most likely @xmath30 remains essentially unchanged from the earlier results , the addition of the new observations has increased the significance of the detection . when no point sources are subtracted , the confidence of a non - zero @xmath30 for the joint likelihood is @xmath6 which can be compared with @xmath35 for the total of all data collected prior to the summer 2000 observations .",
    "much of the motivation for the new bima observations described here was to perform tests for systematic errors that could have been responsible for the previously reported detections .",
    "we first investigated if the observed excess power could somehow depend on the position of the source on the sky .",
    "as described in section  [ sec : fields ] , we selected the four new fields to lie within two degrees of the four fields selected for observation in 1998 .",
    "the results for the two 18 hour right ascension fields , bdf6 and bdf10 , were compared .",
    "observations in 2000 repeated the detection of excess power in bdf6 , but none was found in bdf10 indicating that the observed excess power in bdf6 is not due to a systematic associated with sky position .",
    "for the two 7 hour right ascension fields , bdf7 and bdf11 , the results are not as conclusive ; excess power was detected in both fields . to check for possibility of coherent power between the fields , e.g. , possibly from a local source of interference",
    ", we analyzed the data from the two fields as if they were from the same position on the sky .",
    "no coherent signal was detected ; the level of the detected power decreased .",
    "we have performed several additional tests of the data to search for systematic errors in the fields in which we find excess power . since the data on each field was collected over an extended period of time , we divided the data into blocks of several days and analyzed each block independently",
    ". if we were experiencing problems over a short period of time , we might expect to find a significantly larger detection in one of the blocks of data",
    ". none was found .",
    "we next checked for the presence of systematic errors as a function of time of day . for each field , we divided the data into three blocks spanning equal intervals in hour angle .",
    "again , there was no evidence for anomalous excess power in any of the blocks of data .",
    "although we see no convincing evidence that our determination of excess power is the result of a systematic error , higher sensitivity observations will be necessary to eliminate this possibility .",
    "over the course of three summers , we have used the bima array in a compact configuration at @xmath13ghz to search for cmb anisotropy in eleven independent @xmath36 fwhm fields . with these observations ,",
    "we have made a preliminary detection of arcminute scale cmb anisotropy . in the context of an assumed flat band power model for the cmb power spectrum , we find @xmath4k at @xmath37 confidence with sensitivity on scales that correspond to an average harmonic multipole @xmath38 .",
    "the confidence of a non - zero signal is @xmath6 and we find an upper limit of @xmath7k at @xmath8 confidence .",
    "the 28.5  ghz fluxes of the point sources located with the vla are near or below the noise level in the bima images and make no significant contribution when included in the likelihood analysis .",
    "a recent search for cmb anisotropy on similar angular scales with the atca at 8.7  ghz ( @xcite ) was able to place an upper limit of @xmath39k at @xmath8 confidence , but this work was believed to be confusion limited by unresolved point sources .",
    "we can use our vla @xmath40 flux limit of @xmath41jy at @xmath31 ghz to estimate the contribution of unresolved point sources to the excess power we report . assuming a universal spectral index of @xmath28",
    ", we expect a contribution of @xmath42k due to unresolved point sources in the bima data at 28.5  ghz . assuming a flat spectral index of @xmath43",
    ", we expect a contribution of @xmath44k as a conservative upper limit .",
    "this work is perhaps the first detection of secondary cmb anisotropy in a region of the sky not selected for the presence of a known galaxy cluster .",
    "a detection of excess power is not surprising when one considers the level of anistropy expected from the sz effect of distant clusters of galaxies .",
    "recent hydrodynamic simulations predict a @xmath45k ( @xcite ) .",
    "although this value is larger than our most likely fit , it falls well within our @xmath5 confidence interval .",
    "considering the way in which our blank fields are selected , it is not surprising to find a lower value for @xmath30 than is predicted for randomly selected regions of the sky .",
    "the density of extragalactic radio sources is a tracer of large scale structure . by selecting fields with little point source contamination ,",
    "we introduce a bias against finding clusters of galaxies .",
    "if the excess power we have detected is indeed due to the sz effect in distant clusters of galaxies , deeper observations will resolve the individual clusters enabling a new and powerful probe of large scale structure .",
