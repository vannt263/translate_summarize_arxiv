    "the five stars considered here are pulsating variables and show the sorts of light curve irregularities that are generally associated with classification as semiregular variables .",
    "the measurements section of the simbad database lists v cvn , r umi , and rs cyg as sra stars , ux dra as srb , and sx her as srd , although conflicting classifications exist .",
    "rs cyg and ux dra are also classified as carbon stars . sx her is earlier in spectral type ( k2 ) than the others ( late m or c ) .",
    "v cvn has been reported to have two closely spaced periods ( loeser et al .",
    "1986 , kiss et al .",
    "1999 , kiss et al .",
    "2000 ) and exhibits time - dependent polarization ( boyle et al .",
    "1986 , magalhes et al .",
    "sx her is a metal - poor star ( preston and wallerstein 1963 ) that shows no signs of an infrared excess ( carney et al .",
    "its period is apparently changing slowly ( percy and kolin 2000 ) .",
    "in  3 we argue on physical grounds that the irregular pulsations of these stars can not be multi - periodic as has been suggested ( kiss 1999 ) , nor can they be of a stochastic nature as proposed in konig ( 1999 ) .",
    "this means that , by default , they therefore must be chaotic .",
    "if the light curve is indeed unsteady because of a chatic dynamics , then it is not astonishing that an interpretation within a traditional periodic framework would lead to a spurious conclusion that there are closely spaced peaks or that the period is changing ( buchler , j. r. & kollth , z. , 2001 ) .",
    "in  4 we apply a global flow reconstruction ( serre 1996 ) to the data .",
    "this tool has been specifically designed for the study of chaotic signals which have only a few degrees of freedom ( low dimensional chaos ) .",
    "we show that this reconstruction can capture the pulsation dynamics of these stars .",
    "the fact that the reconstruction allows us to generate synthetic lcs with properties similar to the observed lcs thus provides additional , _ a posteriori _ evidence for low dimensional chaos .",
    "the global flow reconstruction also yields quantitative information about the underlying dynamics , such as its dimension .",
    "we can use this information to uncover the physical nature of the irregular lcs of these stars .",
    "in particular , it allows us to address the question of whether the same resonant mechanism is operative here as in the case of the rv  tau - type star r  scuti where the large amplitude irregular pulsations were shown to be a consequence of the resonant excitation of an overtone with close to double the frequency of the basic pulsation mode under highly nonadiabatic conditions ( buchler 1995 , 1996 ) .",
    "the fundamental mode is self - excited and wants to grow , whereas the entrained , resonant overtone is stable and wants to decay , from which a chaotic motion of alternating growth and decay ensues , a scenario known in nonlinear dynamics under the name of shilnikov ( berg 1986 ) .",
    "our analysis is based on high quality v band light curve ( lc ) data from the observational program at grinnell college that span close to 18 years .",
    "the observations were made with the 0.61 m telescope at the grant o. gale observatory using a conventional photoelectric photometer .",
    "the data were reduced differentially relative to the following comparison stars ( in parentheses after the associated variable star ) : r umi ( hd 150747 ) , rs cyg ( hd 192422 ) , v cvn ( hd 116531 ) , ux dra ( hd 178089 ) , sx her ( hd 145226 ) . the comparison stars were monitored relative to additional check stars and found to exhibit no significant variability . the reduction included corrections for atmospheric extinction and transformation to the ubv system using b band data that are not presented here .",
    "the precision of the data is determined primarily by atmospheric conditions but can be estimated to be about 0.01 magnitude from the repeated measurements that make up a single data point as well as from related data .",
    "because continuity of the data is important for the sort of analysis presented here , efforts were made to essentially eliminate the gaps between observing seasons by taking some data ( a small fraction of the total ) at larger airmasses and in brighter twilight than is desirable for photometric observations .",
    "the quality of the data obtained in twilight was improved by modeling the nonlinear time variation in the sky brightness .",
    "although the quality of the measurements obtained under these conditions is a bit worse than that for data taken under more favorable conditions , it is still good enough for the purposes of this paper and is far preferable to gaps in the data .",
    "the data are available from rrc .",
    "the observed lc data are displayed as dots , jointly with the smoothed fits , in fig .",
    "the sampling is irregular with an average spacing of   10 d. the light curves of r umi , v cvn , and ux dra exhibit sizeable vertical shifts that could be due to dust formation during the pulsation but , as the next section suggests , they could also be part of the intrinsic pulsation dynamics of the stars .",
    "the lc of sx her shows large fluctuations in overall amplitude .",
    "rs cyg displays distinctive dips at the maxima of its lc .",
    "figure  [ vcvnzk ] , we present a comparison of the photoelectric cadmus data and the combined visual amateur astronomer data ( aavso , afoev , baavs , vsjso ) of v  cvn for approximately the same time - intervals .",
    "these smoothed time - series therefore have a different zero points and different amplitudes , and they also have quite a different quality .",
    "( the smoothings that we apply to these data will be discussed below . )",
    "we display the smoothed lcs ( top ) , the amplitude fourier spectra ( fs ) ( right ) and the time - frequency ( tf ) plots ( kollth & buchler 1996 ) , also known as spectrograms .",
    "for the latter we have used the zhao - atlas - marks ( 1990 ) kernel that belongs to a class of tfs known under the name of reduced interference distributions ( rids ) .",
    "these are designed to give much sharper images than the older transforms , such as gbor , for example ( e.g. cohen 1994 ) . in the tf plots",
    "we have enhanced the power at the harmonics to the same level as the fundamental to make it visible ( @xmath0 , where @xmath1 for @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the frequency of the fundamental peak , @xmath4 , for example , for @xmath5 , and a linear increase in between ) .",
    "a comparison of the tf plots with the fs ( on the right ) clearly shows the size of this enhancement @xmath6 .    despite the fact that the cadmus and amateur lcs are appreciably different at times , the tf plots are remarkably similar , showing their insensitivity to observational errors and to the smoothing procedure .    in figs .",
    "[ vcvnzk ] through [ sxherzk ] we display the tfs of rs  cyg , r  umi , ux  dra and sx  her .",
    "the tfs of all five stars show some amplitude ( power ) at twice the fundamental peak , and both rs  cyg and v  cvn also have appreciable amplitude at @xmath7 . from the very appearance of the observed lcs one",
    "finds it hardly astonishing that for all five stars the instantaneous amplitudes in the dominant peaks waver in time , but more interestingly the instantaneous frequencies change as well .",
    "in addition , the first harmonic frequency peak does not change synchronously with that of the fundamental frequency .",
    "this asynchrony between the fundamental and the harmonic peaks rules out that all of the harmonic structure is due to the anharmonicity of the motion .",
    "furthermore it can not be explained by dust or spots , by binarity , by evolution or by stochasticity , even though all of these effects may be present and affect the lcs .",
    "we shall first argue that the pulsations of these stars are neither periodic nor multi - periodic ( see also buchler & kollth 2003 ) .",
    "then we will give physical , energetic arguments that also eliminate a stochastic nature for these pulsations .",
    "this then , by default , leaves a low dimensional chaotic nature as the only alternative .      because the multi - periodic label is sometimes used with different connotations , to be specific , we mean that the signal is such that ( a ) the fs contains a few discrete , basic frequencies , and all the other peaks correspond to linear combinations of these basic frequencies that arise because of nonlinear couplings , and ( b ) the amplitudes and frequencies of all these peaks are constant , or , at most , vary very slowly in time .",
    "the beat cepheids and rr lyrae are examples of this type of systems .",
    "multi - periodicity would thus imply that the major frequency peaks @xmath8 in the fourier spectra are real and should correspond to actual pulsation frequencies or linear combinations thereof . using these frequency peaks one",
    "can then make a multi - periodic fit @xmath9 to the observational data .",
    "for the stars that we are considering we find that we need from 50 to 100 frequencies for a decent fit .",
    "this however poses a physical problem , namely the origin of these frequencies .",
    "indeed , stellar modelling shows that there simply do not exist enough radial modes in the frequency range of interest for these types of star .",
    "this remains true even if allowance is made for nonradial modes with @xmath10 low enough ( say @xmath11 ) to be observable photometrically and assuming that the latter can indeed be excited to such large amplitudes .",
    "furthermore , typically only a few modes are found to be linearly unstable , and one would have to explain why so many other stable modes get entrained to such high amplitudes . we thus conclude that these lcs are not generated by a large set of excited pulsation modes .",
    "there is still the possibility of a multi - periodic , but slowly evolving star .",
    "the structure of the peaks should thus changes slowly as well , but for our five stars the timespan of the observational data is too short compared to the evolutionary timescale .",
    "we note however , that for the rv  tau type star r  sct ( kollth 1990 ) , the frequencies in the fs appear randomly variable from one section of the data to another which thus also eliminates an explanation in terms of slowly evolving multi - periodic stars .",
    "a recent paper ( konig 1999 ) claim to explain the irregular behavior of r  sct as the superposition of two stochastically excited damped linear oscillators .",
    "typically stochastic excitation of vibrationally stable modes , such as the solar oscillations , leads to much smaller amplitudes .",
    "it seems more likely that pulsations as large as those observed in r  sct are due to a self - excited mode , such as in the cepheid and rr lyrae variables .",
    "in fact this brings us to our main rejection of stochastic excitation for r  sct .",
    "while such a stochastic explanation is perhaps correct from a mathematical point of view , it is not meaningful on physical grounds because no mechanism is proposed that could excite damped modes to such large pulsation amplitudes ( up to factors of 40 in the lc of r  sct , for example ) .    in order to be more quantitative ,",
    "let us consider a 0.7  model with l=1000  and = 5300k ( and x=0.726 , z=0.004 ) . in our turbulent convective hydro - code ( kollth 2002 )",
    "this model is unstable in the fundamental mode and leads to chaotic pulsations of alternating large and small amplitudes .",
    "the average pulsational kinetic energies in such typical cycles are @xmath12ke@xmath13 = 0.31@xmath14 and 0.23@xmath14 ergs , respectively .",
    "the average turbulent energies are @xmath12te@xmath13 = 0.15@xmath14 and 0.12@xmath14 ergs , somewhat smaller , but of the same order within the accuracy of mixing - length models . the alleged stochastic excitation of konig ( 1999 ) can only be associated with the convective motions .",
    "our numbers show that even if _ all _ available turbulent energy were converted into pulsational kinetic energy , there is barely enough energy .",
    "the pulsation is closely associated with a single ( most likely radial ) pulsation mode , or perhaps at most two of them , thus has a very directed form of kinetic energy .",
    "the amount of energy transferred stochastically from the kinetic energy associated with the largely disordered turbulent convection to these modes depends on the overlap integrals between the spatial distribution of the turbulent energy ( eqs .",
    "6 and 7 of buchler , goupil & kovcs 1993 ) .",
    "this overlap must be extremely small because of the very different nature of the two types of motion .",
    "furthermore the power in the fourier spectrum of turbulent convection at the pulsation frequency is very limited .",
    "this rules out stochasticity as the cause of the observed irregular behavior .    however , the amount of energy flowing through the pulsating envelope , the product of the luminosity and the period @xmath156.1@xmath14 ergs , is almost 100 times the pulsation kinetic energy .",
    "this highly nonadiabatic situation certainly allows the observed changes in pulsational kinetic energy .",
    "a perhaps better estimate of the efficiency of conversion of heat into pulsation energy , or the percentage change of pulsation kinetic energy per cycle , is given by the linear growth - rates of the modes ( @xmath16 for the stellar model above ) .",
    "this is precisely what a chaotic dynamics is about : the nonlinear interaction of a small number of strongly nonadiabatic ( dissipative ) pulsation modes .",
    "we conclude that it is therefore ultimately physics that rules out stochasticity for these stars .",
    "this is not to say , however , that superposed on the low dimensional radial chaotic dynamics , there can not be stochastic motions , which furthermore are nonradial .",
    "there are additional reasons for believing that the pulsations of these five stars are chaotic and have a low dimension : first , numerical hydrodynamic simulations , albeit of w  virginis type stellar models , uncovered the chaotic nature of the pulsations ( buchler & kovcs 1987 , aikawa 1987 , buchler , goupil & kovcs 1987 , kovcs & buchler 1988 , letellier 1996 ) .",
    "second , the analysis of the lc of the rv  tau - type star r  scuti clearly demonstrated the presence of a low dimensional chaotic pulsation dynamics ( buchler , serre , kollth & mattei 1995 , buchler , kollth , serre & mattei 1996 ) .",
    "more recent work by other authors gives corroborating evidence for low dimensional chaos in large amplitude variabel stars ( kiss & szatmry 2002 , ambika 2003 ) .",
    "linear analyses are very useful for multi - periodic signals , but it is well known , at least outside astronomy , that for irregular , intrinsically nonlinear signals they yield limited information about the dynamics ( weigend & gershenfeld 1994 , abarbanel 1993 ) . as we have already mentioned , a phenomenologically motivated multiperiodic fit will always be successful as an interpolation , but will give us not much information about the stellar pulsation aside from one or perhaps several average periods. for the study such chaotic signals and for understanding the underlying dynamics a different approach is required .",
    "a popular test for nonlinear behavior is the construction of first return maps ( ott 1993 ) . for a dynamics with a fractal attractor with fractal dimension @xmath172 , such as the rssler band ,",
    "the first return maps show a tight parabolic structure , but for our stars they turn out to be essentially scatter diagrams .",
    "this negative result implies that , if this attractor is indeed fractal , the fractal dimension of the dynamics substantially exceeds a value of 2 , and could even be greater than 3 .",
    "we recall that for the star r  sct it was found that @xmath18 ( buchler 1996 ) .",

    "over the last decade we have developed a special tool for the analysis of irregular time - series , namely the _ global flow reconstruction technique _",
    "( reconstruction technique for short ) .",
    "our primary motivation has not been phenomenological , but rather has aimed for an understanding of the physical mechanism behind the irregular lcs of variable stars on the one hand , and for deriving qualitative and quantitative properties of this dynamics ( serre 1996 ; reviewed in buchler 1997 , buchler & kollth 2001 ; a similar approach was followed in other research areas , gouesbet 1997 , hegger 1999 ) .",
    "only two very simple working assumptions underlie the reconstruction technique : ( 1 ) _ the lc is produced by the ( deterministic ) nonlinear interaction of a small number of pulsation modes _ , ( 2 ) _ the system is autonomous _ , explicit time - dependence , such as evolution over the span of the data , can be ignored .",
    "it may appear astonishing that one should be able to derive basic physical properties of the star from the mere knowledge of a _",
    "scalar _ time - series , such as the lc .",
    "yet , in the case of the star r  scuti it was possible to demonstrate that the irregular pulsations are the result of the nonlinear interaction between a self - excited pulsation mode that entrains a vibrationally stable mode through an approximate 2:1 resonance ( buchler 1995 , 1996 ) .",
    "the technique introduces a ( euclidean ) _ reconstruction space _ of dimension @xmath28 , in which one uses the observed time - series @xmath29 to construct successive position vectors @xmath30 the quantity @xmath21 is called the delay .",
    "assumption ( 1 ) allows us to use the observed time - series to construct the best mathematical relationship @xmath31 , ( called a map or a flow in the case of a differential description ) , that evolves the system that produces the lc from one time - step to the next : @xmath32 a dimension @xmath28 that is large enough to capture the dynamics of the pulsation is called an _ embedding dimension_.",
    "our goal is to find the",
    "_ minimum embedding dimension _",
    "this dimension @xmath33 is not known and it is one of the fundamental quantities that the analysis aims to determine .",
    "this dimension is important because it is closely related to the dimension @xmath34 of the actual physical phase space of the dynamics .",
    "for example , for a single oscillatory mode , @xmath34 would be equal to 2 , for 2 coupled oscillatory modes @xmath35 , and the involvement of a secular mode would add 1 to the dimension . practice has shown that a multivariate polynomial functional form is suitable for the map @xmath36 and that polynomes up to order of 4 are generally sufficient ; the coefficients of these polynomials are computed with a least - squares fit to the observed time - series ( serre 1996 ) .",
    "the reconstruction technique also introduces a _ delay _",
    "@xmath21 which we consider a free parameter .",
    "the reconstruction requires a time series with equal time intervals .",
    "our data preparation is done in several steps :   ( a ) the data are binned and averaged over a time interval @xmath37 . the typical time interval for the cadmus data has a very broad peak around 10d . in the following we have chosen values for @xmath37 = 10d , except for ux  dra where we chose 1d .",
    "( b ) the data are next smoothed with a cubic spline ( reinsch 1967 ) with a smoothing @xmath19 which results in an equally spaced time series , with time intervals chosen to be 1d .",
    "( c ) finally a moving gaussian filter of width @xmath20 is applied to the splined time series .",
    "results of a preliminary analysis of these stars were reported in buchler , kollth & cadmus 2001 . here",
    "we perform a much broader analysis ; in particular our search covers a wider range of smoothings , @xmath19 and @xmath20 . as a result",
    "we obtain firmer conclusions than were obtained in that paper .    -1.5 cm      in this section we apply the reconstruction to the observed lc of r  umi , and concurrently we discuss some of the technical details of the reconstruction .    in figure  [ rumisyn ] on top",
    "we display a fit to the r  umi data , with the smoothing parameters @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "two observational points , at jd 46039.5095 and 46613.8169 , give an unnatural looking wiggle in the smoothed data ( in fig .  1 of buchler 2001 )",
    ", and have therefore been omitted in the reconstructions .",
    "we have verified though that the reconstructions with all the observational points give essentially the same results , indicating a relative insensitivity of the r  umi reconstructions to individual points .    in practice ,",
    "the reconstructions proceed as follows : from a smoothed light curve ( with given @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) a map @xmath40 is constructed for a given dimension @xmath28 and a given value of delay @xmath21 .",
    "this map @xmath40 is then iterated from a seed value ( chosen along the observed time - series ) to generate what we call a _",
    "synthetic _ lc . actually , the map @xmath40 generates @xmath28 scalar sequences , namely the components of @xmath41 , shifted with respect to each other by @xmath21 days , but are essentially identical when superposed .",
    "this can be considered an _ a posteriori _ confirmation that the reconstruction is successful . for r",
    "umi as for the other stars we have chosen 15000  d long iterations of which we typically discard the first three thousand days , because they may be transients in the evolution toward the chaotic attractor .",
    "because the data preparation obviously will have an effect on the reconstructed attractors , we therefore perform them for a range of smoothing and filtering values @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "ideally , we would also expect the results of the reconstructions to be independent of these smoothing parameters in some range of values ( for a discussion of these issues we refer to serre 1996 ) . in our surveys",
    "we perform the reconstructions with delays typically ranging from @xmath42 to 40  d. in a robust reconstruction the results should come out similar for some range of neighboring @xmath21 values .",
    "it is obvious that for a successful reconstruction the data have to sample sufficiently well the dominant features of the dynamics in phase space .",
    "when the lc is very short  there are only 20 pulsation cycles for r  umi  the iteration of the constructed maps is not always stable and the synthetic lcs blow up .",
    "there can be several causes for such behavior , boundary crises ( ott 1993 ) . in practice , we iterate a given map successively with different seeds until we obtain a synthetic lc of sufficient length and quality .",
    "how do we judge the quality of the reconstruction ?",
    "there is no point in comparing chaotic signals point by point , but rather they need to be compared in a global or statistical sense .",
    "however , we are seriously hampered by the shortness of both the observed and synthetic lcs .",
    "we are therefore forced to rely on more subjective criteria .",
    "our first acceptance criterion relies on _ a visual comparison _ of the observed and synthetic lcs .",
    "when we attempt reconstructions for r  umi in 3d ( with @xmath43 ) , we find that the synthetic lcs bear no resemblance to the observed lc for any @xmath19 or @xmath20 .",
    "it is therefore immediately obvious that @xmath44 .",
    "in contrast , the 4d reconstructions show a relatively large insensitivity to the smoothing .",
    "we have made our survey with @xmath45 , 0.02 , to 0.05 and @xmath46 , 4 and 8 ( @xmath20=0 indicates that no gaussian filter was applied ) .",

    "we see that the reconstructions consistently reproduce the linear part of the maps , despite the fact that the amplitude of the lc never gets very small , and that therefore it does not explore the neighborhood of the fixed point .",

    "lyapunov exponents and the ( generally non - integer ) _ lyapunov dimension @xmath54 _ ( ott 1993 , serre 1996 ) can give us additional quantitative information about the attractor .",
    "in particular @xmath54 sets a lower limit on the dimension @xmath34 of the physical phase space , because an attractor of fractal dimension @xmath54 must live in a euclidean space of dimension @xmath55 .",
    "for example , a dynamical system of two coupled pulsation modes ( @xmath56 ) can have an attractor with a fractal dimension @xmath57 .    in order to extract accurate lyapunov exponents and a lyapunov dimension @xmath54 one needs lcs containing at least 500 cycles , @xmath15 200,000d . the observed lc with 6500d",
    "is much too short for that purpose .",
    "furthermore the maps for r  umi are not stable enough to generate sufficiently long synthetic lcs to compute reliable lyapunov exponents , but they yield a rough estimate . for 12000d long synthetic lcs with @xmath58 the @xmath54 fall in a broad range from 2 .",

    "we believe that these latter values may be closer to the actual value of @xmath54 , but these values should be taken with a grain of salt .    in principle",
    ", 5d reconstructions can be used to confirm that a 4d space is large enough , because the fractal dimension should be independent of the dimension of the reconstruction space .",
    "unfortunately , such reconstructions are not very robust because of the paucity of pulsation cycles in the observed lc .",
    "we note however that the @xmath54 for the few decent 5d synthetic lcs that we could make cluster around 3.5 , they essentially do not increase much as @xmath28 is increased from 4 to 5 .",
    "this is a corroboration that the embedding dimension is indeed @xmath49 .    in the study of r  sct ( buchler 1995 , 1996 ) , with the help of @xmath64",
    ", we were able to obtain a _",
    "lower limit _ of 4 for the dimension @xmath34 of the physical phase space of the dynamics , and very strong evidence for a minimum embedding dimension @xmath49 gave an _ upper limit _ of @xmath35 .",
    "we thus could infer that @xmath35 for r  sct . here",
    ", for r  umi we can state the minimum @xmath49 and thus the upper limit on @xmath65 with only some confidence . also , because of the uncertainties in @xmath54 just mentioned we obtain a lower limit of either 3 or 4 for @xmath34 , depending whether @xmath66 or @xmath67 .",
    "however , if @xmath34 were only equal to 3 , then one would have to invoke the coupling of one oscillatory mode ( 2d ) with a thermal ( secular ) mode ( 1d ) , rather than with a second oscillatory pulsation mode ( 2d ) . while this is possible we deem it unlikely , and it appears that @xmath35 , as for r  sct . in this 4d physical phase space , the complex amplitudes of the two pulsation modes may be considered the natural generalized coordinates for this dynamics .",
    "furthermore , the linear stability analysis of the 4d maps gives us results that are very similar to those of r  sct ( buchler 1996 ) .",
    "we can therefore conclude that the same pulsation mechanism is operative in r  umi , namely that its irregular lc is generated by two nonlinearly interacting , resonant modes in which the low frequency mode is linearly unstable and the harmonic mode is linearly stable , resulting in a continual and unsteady energy exchange .",

    "-1.5 cm      the reader may be curious why in contrast to the cepheids , which are the close relatives of the semiregular variables , pulsate in a regular , periodic or multiperiodic fashion .",

    "the reason for this difference lies in the fact that the luminosity / mass ratio of the latter is about ten times larger .",
    "this causes a large increase in the coupling between pulsation and heat flow and concomitantly in the growth rates .",
    "when the relative growth rates of the excited modes are small , as in the classical cepheids , there exists near center manifold in the parlance of nonlinear dynamics , buchler 1993 ) .",
    "it can then be shown that the most complicated motions will be periodic pulsations ( limit cycles ) or multiperiodic pulsations ( beat cepheids ) .",
    "no such manifold exists in the highly nonadiabatic semiregular stars , and more complicated , irregular ( chaotic ) pulsations can arise . intuitively , large growth rates are a prerequisite for irregular pulsations , for amplitude modulation on the time scale of a period , although this is not sufficient .",
    "it was shown unambiguously that the hertzsprung progression of the fourier phases of the bump cepheids has its origin in a 2:1 resonance between the linearly unstable fundamental mode and the linearly stable second overtone ( buchler 1993 ) .",
    "it is again the presence of a center manifold that gives rise to a synchronization of the two modes , and a periodic pulsation results in which the presence of the entrained second mode merely gives rise to a bump on the light curve .",
    "in contrast , although the same 2:1 resonance occurs in the semiregulars , the absence of a center manifold allows the pulsation to be chaotic .",
    "we have analyzed the 6500day long observed lcs of the semiregular / mira stars r  umi , v  cvn , rs  cyg , sx  her and ux  dra .",
    "first , with a time - frequency analysis we have shown that in each case the dominant instantaneous frequency peak is not steady , and that the harmonic peak does not vary synchronously with the dominant one .",
    "this has led to the conclusion that these stars are not multi - periodic in the usual sense of the word , but that they are more likely to be generated by a low dimensional chaotic dynamics that involves a small number of pulsations modes .",
    "_ multimode _ might therefore be a more suitable label for these stars than multiperiodic .",
    "the results of a global flow reconstruction technique give strong evidence that the lcs of all five stars are generated by a low dimensional chaotic pulsation dynamics .",
    "the observed lcs of all 5 stars are really very short in terms of the number of pulsation cycles and their complexity , and our results must be taken with a little caution .",
    "however , interestingly , the evidence is very strong that for r  umi , rs  cyg and v  cvn , and probably for ux  dra as well , the pulsation takes place in a 4d phase space .",
    "the lc of sx  her appears to be more complicated and perhaps a higher dimensional space , 6d , may be required .",
    "our analysis shows that the lcs of r  umi and rsc  cyg are generated by nonlinear dynamics that involve two resonant pulsation modes , a linearly self - excited lower frequency mode which entrains a second , linearly stable mode through a 2:1 resonance .",
    "the irregular pulsation occurs as a result of continual exchange of energy between the two resonant modes .",
    "this is the same scenario as was found for the irregularly pulsating rv  tau - type star r  sct ( buchler 1995 , 1996 ) , but we caution that the reconstructions are not as robust as they are for r  sct because of the shortness of the observed light curves . in particular , we were not able to construct long synthetic lcs and extract a reliable lyapunov dimension from these as for r  sct .",
    "the analysis of rs  cyg strongly suggests the presence of the same pulsation mechanism is operative .",
    "interestingly , the analysis shows that the lc of v  cvn may similarly be due to a resonant interaction of two pulsation modes in a 2:1 resonance , but here it appears that the higher frequency mode is self - excited , whereas the lower frequency mode is stable .",
    "the analysis of ux  dra is much less conclusive , but is compatible with the same resonant 2-mode scenario .    to summarize then",
    ", we find good evidence for a common physical explanation for the irregularity that characterizes the pulsations of r  umi , rs  cyg , v  cvn ( and probably ux  dra ) as we had found earlier for r  sct , namely that the underlying low dimensional chaotic pulsation dynamics arises from the nonlinear interaction of two resonant modes , and their high nonadiabaticity causes the pulsations to be chaotic .",
