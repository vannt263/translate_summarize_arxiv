    "this occurs when the two - body scattering length is much larger than the range of the two - body interaction . as a candidate of such three - body states ,",
    "efimov discussed about the famous hoyle state  @xcite ( the second @xmath8 state at 7.65mev in the @xmath9c nucleus ) taking a model of three @xmath10 particles ( clusters of three @xmath0he nuclei ) as well as about the three - nucleon bound state ( @xmath11h nuclei ) . in nuclear systems , the borromean states , weakly bound three - body states though having no bound two - body subsystems , are familiar but not classified as efimov states . in atomic systems , triatomic @xmath0he ( trimer ) have been expected to have bound states of efimov type since the realistic @xmath0he-@xmath0he interactions  @xcite give a large @xmath0he-@xmath0he scattering length ( @xmath12 ) , much greater than the potential range ( @xmath13 ) , and a very small @xmath0he dimer binding energy ( @xmath14 mk ) .",

    ", it should be efimov nature , and iii ) it is suggested that the @xmath0he trimer ground state may be considered as an efimov state since the ground- and excited - state binding energies move along the same universal scaling curve under any small deformation of the two - body potential ( for details , see , e.g. , sec.iii of ref .",
    "experimentally , the @xmath0he trimer ground state has been observed in ref .",
    "@xcite to have the @xmath0he-@xmath0he bond length of @xmath20 @xmath16 in agreement with theoretical predictions , whereas a reliable experimental evidence for the @xmath0he trimer excited state is still missing .    only very recently , experimental evidences of efimov trimer states have been reported in the work using the ultracold gases of cesium atoms  @xcite , potasium atoms  @xcite , lithium-7 atoms  @xcite , and atoms  @xcite , in which the two - body interaction between those alkali atoms was manipulated so as to tune the scattering length to values significantly greater than the potential range .",
    "these experiments have been accessing the study of a wide variety of interesting physical systems in the atomic and nuclear fields .",
    "recently , the study extends to the efimov physics and universality of four - atomic systems ( tetramers ) .",
    "though the interactions between @xmath0he atoms can not be manipulated , the study of @xmath0he trimer using the realistic pair potentials has been providing fundamental information to the efimov physics .",
    "now it is one of the challenging subjects to precisely investigate the structure of @xmath0he tetramer using the realistic @xmath0he-@xmath0he potential .",
    "so far there exist in the literature a large number of @xmath0he trimer calculations  @xcite giving well converged results with the realistic @xmath0he-@xmath0he interactions .",
    "however , calculations of the tetramer remain limited  @xcite ; in those papers , the binding energy of the tetramer ground state agrees well with each other , while that of the loosely bound excited state differs significantly from one another .",
    "thus the main purpose of the present paper is to perform accurate calculations of the @xmath0he tetramer ground and excited states using a realistic @xmath0he-@xmath0he interaction , the lm2m2 potential  @xcite .",
    "we employ the gaussian expansion method ( gem ) for _ ab",
    "initio _ variational calculations of few - body systems  @xcite .",
    "the method has been proposed and developed by the present authors and collaborators and applied to various types of three- , four- and five - body systems in nuclear physics and exotic atomic / molecular physics ( cf .",
    "review papers @xcite ) .",
    "advantage of using the gem for the @xmath0he tetramer calculation in the presence of the strong short - range repulsive potential is as follows : some 30000 symmetrized four - body gaussian basis functions , ranging from very compact to very diffuse , are constructed on the full 18 sets of jacobi coordinates without assuming any pair correlation function .",
    "they forms a nearly complete set in the finite coordinate space concerned , so that one can describe accurately both the short - range structure and the long - range asymptotic behavior ( up to @xmath2  ) of the four - body wave function , which makes it possible to find new facets of @xmath0he clusters .",
    "we thus find that precisely the same shape of the short - range correlation ( @xmath21  ) in dimer appears in the ground and excited states of trimer and tetramer .",
    "this gives a foundation to an _ a priori _ assumption that a two - particle correlation function ( such as the jastrow s ) so as to simulate the short - range part of the dimer wave function is incorporated in the trimer and tetramer wave functions from the beginning .    by illustrating the asymptotic behavior of the @xmath0he trimer and tetramer , we discuss about an interesting relation between their excited - state wave functions and the dimer wave function .",
    "we then come to propose a dimerlike - pair model that predicts the binding energy of the first excited state of the @xmath22-cluster system , @xmath0he@xmath3 , measured from the ground state of @xmath0he@xmath5 to be approximately @xmath6 using the dimer binding energy @xmath7 .",
    "we explicitly write the asymptotic form of the total wave function of @xmath0he trimer ( tetramer ) .",
    "the asymptotic normalization coefficient ( anc )  @xcite , namely the amplitude of tail function of the ( trimer - atom ) relative motion in the present case , is a quantity to reflect the internal structure of trimer ( tetramer ) . therefore , attention to the anc might be useful when one intends to reproduce the non - universal variation of the @xmath0he trimer ( tetramer ) states by means of parametrizing models beyond efimov s universal theory .",

    "ii , we apply the gem to the three - body calculation of the @xmath0he trimer ground and excited states showing that the calculated results agree excellently with the literature . in sec .",

    "one of the most important issues of the present variational calculation is what type of radial shape we use for @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the basis functions should be capable of precisely describing the strong short - range correlation ( without assuming any correlation function _ a priori _ ) and the long - range asymptotic behavior of very loosely bound states .",
    "the gem recommends two types of functions which are tractable in few - body calculations and work acculately .",

    "@xcite ) of the @xmath0he trimer ground and excited state with the use of the hfdhe2 potential  @xcite .",
    "the latter function is introduced in sec.ii.c .      the radial function @xmath64 in ( 2.9 ) is taken to be a gaussian multiplied by @xmath65 ( similarly for @xmath66 ): @xmath67 where normalization constants are omitted for simplicity .",
    "setting of the ranges by stochastic or random choice does not seem suitable for describing the strong short - range correlation and the long - range asymptotic behavior of the wave function .",

    "the gem recommends to set them in a _",
    "geometric _ progression : @xmath68 with common ratios @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "this greatly reduces the nonlinear parameters to be optimized .",
    "we designate a set of the geometric sequence by @xmath71 instead of @xmath72 and similarly for @xmath73 , which is more convenient to consider the spatial distribution of the basis set .",
    "optimization of the nonlinear range parameters is in principle by trial and error procedure but much of experiences and systematics have been accumulated in many studies using the gem .    the basis functions \\{@xmath74 } have the following properties : i ) they range from very compact to very diffuse , more densely in the inner region than in the outer one .",
    "while the basis functions with small ranges are responsible for describing the short - range structure of the system , the basis with longest - range parameters are for the asymptotic behavior .",
    "ii ) they , being multiplied by normalization constants for @xmath75 , have a relation @xmath76 which tells that the overlap with the @xmath77-th neighbor is _ independent _ of @xmath78 , decreasing gradually with increasing @xmath77 .",
    "we then expect that the coupling among the whole basis functions take place smoothly and coherently so as to describe properly both the short - range structure and long - range asymptotic behavior simultaneously .",
    "we note that a single gaussian decays quickly as @xmath79 increases , but appropriate superposition of many gaussians can decay even exponentially up to a sufficiently large distance .",
    "a good example is shown in fig .  3 of ref .",

    "the examples includes our previous calculation of the ground and excited states of @xmath0he trimer using the hfdhe2 potential ; the binding energies were in good agreement with those given by a feddeev - equation calculation  @xcite .",
    "as for the trimer wave function , we showed , in figs .  3 , 13 and 14 in ref.@xcite , that the strong short - range correlation ( @xmath84  ) and asymptotic behavior ( up to @xmath85  ) of the trimer ground and excited states are simultaneously well described .",
    "also , the three - body basis functions ( 2.9)(2.13 ) together with the lm2m2 potential were used recently by naidon , ueda and one of the present authors ( e. h. )  @xcite to study the universality and the three - body parameter of @xmath0he trimers .      before we proceed to the calculation of the @xmath0he tetramer ground and excited states",

    "they should satisfy @xmath404 with @xmath405 ( @xmath406 @xmath122 and @xmath407 @xmath122 ) . the dashed line ( @xmath408 ) and solid line ( @xmath409 ) reproduces the asymptotic functions ( 3.22 ) with the anc @xmath410 @xmath212 and @xmath411 @xmath212",
    "( see the open circles ) , respectively , up to @xmath215  .",
    "asymptotically the tetramer is dissociated into the trimer ground state and a distant atom in the symmetric way between the four atoms ( with negligible amount of the trimer excited state ) .",
    "therefore , the tetramer wave function @xmath412 is represented asymptotically as @xmath413 where the summation over @xmath78 symmetrizes the four atoms ; namely , the @xmath78th atom is isolated at @xmath414 from the trimer @xmath415 in which the @xmath78th atom is absent and the other three atoms are symmetrized .    as for the tetramer s anc",
    ", we can make the same comments as those for the trimer s anc below eq.(2.26 ) .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : tetra - red - long ] , we note that the exponentially - decaying slope of the solid line ( @xmath416 ) is very close to that in the trimer excited state ( @xmath417 ) and that in the dimer ( @xmath418 ) .",
    "this gives a support to the dimerlike - pair model for the tetramer excited state in the asymptotic region ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dimer - model]b ) .",
    "we can therefore predict that , in the asymptotic region , the pair correlation function @xmath419 should be proportional to @xmath420 .",
    "this is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : tetra - den - long ] though the solid line ( @xmath50 ) is not so excellently straight as in the trimer excited state ( dot - dashed line ) due to the complexity of the four - body calculation .",
    "as mentioned in sec.ii.g , the dimerlike - pair model predicted @xmath421 mk . in the present calculation , we obtained @xmath422 mk .",
    "the prediction is very good as long as the lm2m2 potential is employed .",
    "generally , in the case of @xmath0he@xmath3 , the excited - state binding energy calculated using realistic potentials may be expected as @xmath423 where the factor multiplied to @xmath7 comes from the ratio of the reduced mass of the dimerlike pair ( @xmath424 ) to that of the @xmath0he@xmath16-@xmath0he@xmath5 system ( @xmath425 ) .",
    "but , as discussed in sec.ii.g , the factor might depend on the realistic potentials with a small deviation ( roughly @xmath426 ) .",
    "we have calculated the ground and excited states of @xmath0he trimer and tetramer using the lm2m2 potential which has a strong short - range repulsive potential and is one of the most widely used @xmath0he-@xmath0he interactions .",
    "we employed the gaussian expansion method ( gem ) for _ ab initio _ variational calculations of few - body systems .",
    "the symmetrized three-(four-)body gaussian basis functions , ranging from very compact to very diffuse , are constructed on the full sets of possible jacobi coordinates .",
    "therefore , the basis set , spanning a wide function space , is suitable for describing both the short - range correlation ( without assuming any pair correlation function ) and the long - range asymptotic behavior of the trimer ( tetramer ) wave function as well as suitable for obtaining accurate binding energies .",
    "the main conclusions are summarized as follows :",
    "\\i ) calculated binding energies of the trimer ground and excited states , @xmath127 and @xmath128 , respectively , agree excellently with the literature ( table i ) ; we have @xmath173 mk and @xmath174 mk .",
    "\\ii ) as for the binding energies of the tetramer ground and excited states , we obtained @xmath427 mk and @xmath422 mk ( situated only 0.93 mk below the atom - trimer threshold ) .",
    "the former is in good agreement with the literature calculations , while the latter supports the result of 127.5 mk by ref .",
    "@xcite differently from the other literature results ( table viii ) .",
    "\\iii ) we found that the strong short - range correlation ( @xmath21  ) seen in the dimer appears also in the ground and excited states of the trimer and tetramer precisely in the same shape ( figs .  3 and 8) .",
    "this gives a foundation to an _ a priori _ assumption that a pair correlation function to simulate the short - range part of the dimer wave function is incorporated in the three-(four-)body wave function from the beginning .",
    "\\iv ) illustrating the overlap function between the trimer excited state and the dimer ( @xmath428 ) and that between the tetramer excited state and the trimer ground state ( @xmath429 ) , we found that those overlap functions are almost proportional to the dimer wave function in the asymptotic region up to @xmath2 @xmath16 ( figs .  4 and 10 ) .",
    "also it was found that the pair correlation functions of trimer and tetramer excited states ( @xmath430 and @xmath431 , respectively ) are almost proportional to the squared dimer wave function in the asymptotic region ( figs .  6 and 11 ) .",
    "we then came to propose a dimerlike pair model ( fig .",
    "5 ) that predicts the excited - state binding energy of @xmath0he@xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) using eq .  ( 3.24 ) .",
    "it will be of interest to examine this model in the case of @xmath432 .",
    "a five - body calculation of the pentamer , @xmath0he@xmath433 , is in progress .",
    "\\v ) we calculated the asymptotic normalization coefficient ( anc ) of the tail function of the relative motion in trimer ( tetramer ) .",
    "this result may be available in peripheral reactions ( insensitive to the interior of the system ) including the @xmath0he trimers and tetramers , in which the reaction cross section will be proportional to the squared anc .",
    "the anc is a quantity to convey the interior structural information to the asymptotic behavior .",
    "therefore , attention to this quantity might be helpful when one tries to reproduce the non - universal variation of the @xmath0he trimer ( tetramer ) states by means of parametrizing models beyond efimov s universal theory .",
