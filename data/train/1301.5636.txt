    "recent experimental progress in the control of ultracold polar molecules @xcite has stimulated the study of many - body systems featuring strong dipole - dipole interactions @xcite . a particularly promising research area @xcite of implementing lattice hamiltonians from dipole - dipole - interacting molecules has emerged following the pioneering works of refs .",
    "this research area largely owes its promise to the great degree of controllability that external dc , microwave , and optical fields can provide over rotational levels and dipole - dipole interactions @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we demonstrated that this controllability can yield a variety of spin hamiltonians , in which spin states are encoded in superpositions of rotational states of the molecules .",
    "while dipole - dipole interactions are often thought of as being proportional to @xmath6 , where @xmath7 are the spherical coordinates of the vector connecting the two dipoles , we showed that not only the overall amplitude and sign of the spin hamiltonian but also its individual terms can depend on @xmath8 .",
    "we harnessed this dependence to propose the realization of spin models known to harbor topological phases of matter @xcite .",
    "in contrast to ref .",
    "@xcite , which focused on the simplest examples , in the present paper we discuss a range of models that are more interesting but harder to implement experimentally .",
    "specifically , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we emphasize that the interaction hamiltonian between two molecules can , in principle , be a sum of five independently controllable terms proportional to the five rank-2 spherical harmonics @xmath0 .",
    "we then study a specific class of hamiltonians with an arbitrary spin @xmath2 .",
    "this class of hamiltonians can be used to realize @xcite the general su(2 ) symmetric @xmath9 model , i.e.  the bilinear - biquadratic spin model , which has a rich phase diagram even in one dimension @xcite .",
    "it can also give rise to su(@xmath3=@xmath4+@xmath5 ) spin models , which have recently attracted a great deal of theoretical and experimental attention due to their potential to access exotic strongly - correlated phases in alkaline - earth atoms @xcite .",
    "the strong dipole - dipole interactions of the polar - molecule implementation of su(@xmath3 ) models can be larger than the su(@xmath3)-symmetric superexchange interactions in cold - atom implementations @xcite",
    ". then we turn to the primary example of this paper : the implementation of the kitaev honeycomb model .",
    "in contrast to the proposal of ref .",
    "@xcite , our implementation of the kitaev honeycomb model relies on direct  rather than perturbative  dipole - dipole interaction and hence gives rise to stronger interactions , which are easier to access experimentally .",
    "other proposals for implementing the kitaev honeycomb model use solid - state mott insulators @xcite , trapped ions @xcite , superconducting quantum circuits @xcite , weak superexchange interaction between cold atoms in optical lattices @xcite , and an experimentally challenging system of coupled cavity arrays @xcite .",
    "we end the manuscript with a discussion of how we use microwave fields to create the dressed states that enable our implementations , followed by an outlook .",

    "each molecule is described by the hamiltonian h_0 = b ^2 - e d^z . in general , the molecules can be allowed to hop to give rise to hubbard - type @xcite or @xmath16-@xmath17-type @xcite models with highly tunable anisotropic long - range spin - spin interactions . in this paper , however , we will assume that the lattice is so deep that tunneling is negligible and molecules are pinned in the motional ground state on each site .",

    "we also note that one has to be careful using @xmath45 transitions to couple states with @xmath214 since the same microwave will act on both @xmath23 and @xmath215 .    a solution alternative to the introduction of a detuning",
    "is an introduction of additional resonant microwave couplings , resulting in configurations such as three states coupled with three microwave fields . at the same time",
    ", it is worth pointing out that , in some cases , one may wish to introduce additional detunings on purpose with the goal of eliminating certain interaction processes ( written in terms of bare non - microwave - dressed states as @xmath216 ) , which can be regarded as an additional control knob .",
    "the most straightforward implementation of our proposal would involve polar molecules with no nuclear spin .",
    "this is possible , for example , in the case of a sryb molecule , which seems to be within reach given the availability of quantum degenerate sr and yb gases @xcite . in the case where hyperfine structure is present , such as in alkali dimers ,",
    "we assume that the rabi frequencies @xmath191 are larger than the strength of hyperfine interactions @xmath217 . in situations where this poses a significant restriction , the opposite limit , in which @xmath218 , can also be considered .",
    "while we have focused on pinned molecules , allowing the molecules to hop in the lattice gives rise to @xmath16@xmath17-type @xcite or hubbard - type @xcite models with highly tunable long - range spin - spin interactions featuring a direction - dependent spin anisotropy . as a particularly simple example",
    ", one can obtain a single - component system with a density - density interaction whose angular dependence is given by a linear combination of all five @xmath219 [ see the @xmath115 term in eq .",

    "this may allow one to study , for example , exotic quantum hall physics @xcite .",
    "the approaches we presented can be used to tune dipole - dipole interactions to zero @xcite . in that case",
    ", one has to consider corrections due to dipole - dipole interactions to second order ( which give van - der - waals - type @xmath220 dependence ) and interactions between higher multipole moments @xcite .",
    "these interactions can also be viewed as extra control knobs .",
    "we have focused in the present manuscript on polar molecules .",
