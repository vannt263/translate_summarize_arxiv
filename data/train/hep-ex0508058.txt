    "the cdf and d  experiments have previously reported on searches for the rare decay @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "cdf also directly searched for the decay @xmath1 .",
    "these decays are highly suppressed in the standard model of particle physics with branching ratios of @xmath8 and @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "however , decays of this type can be significantly enhanced in many scenarios beyond the standard model  @xcite .",
    "a combination of results leads to more stringent limits and is of considerable interest in exploring the phase space of the models where strong enhancements for @xmath0  or @xmath1are predicted . in this note",
    "we report on a combination of limits in the @xmath0  and @xmath1  decay channels .",
    "cdf and d  use similar methodologies to search for the @xmath0  decay .",
    "cdf applied the same methods to directly search for the decay @xmath1 .",
    "each experiment looks for two oppositely charged muons in the @xmath10 and @xmath11 mass range using dedicated triggers .",
    "cdf divides their dataset into two channels : the `` central '' channel consists of muon pairs reconstructed in the pseudorapidity region , @xmath12 , and the `` central - extended '' channel consists of dimuon events where one muon is reconstructed in the central region and the second muon in the extended muon system , @xmath13 .",
    "the two channels have different sensitivities , therefore the optimization is performed separately for each channel .",
    "the branching ratio is computed by normalizing the number of signal events to the number of reconstructed @xmath4  @xcite events . the branching ratio or limit",
    "is then calculated from the equation : @xmath14 where :    * @xmath15 is the number of observed @xmath0  candidates ; * @xmath16 is the geometric and kinematic acceptance of the di - muon trigger for @xmath0  decays ; * @xmath17 is the total efficiency ( including trigger , reconstruction and analysis requirements ) for @xmath0  events in the acceptance ; * @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 are similarly defined for @xmath4  decays ; * @xmath21 accounts for the different @xmath22-quark fragmentation probabilities and is : + @xmath23 , where the anti - correlation between the uncertainties has been accounted for  @xcite ; * @xmath24 are used  @xcite .",
    "the experiments normalize to the decay mode @xmath4  rather than to the @xmath25 decay @xmath26 .",
    "normalizing to the decay @xmath4  is preferable since the mode has higher statistics and the branching ratio and lifetime are well known from the measurements at cleo and the asymmetric @xmath27 factories .",
    "in addition , understanding the efficiency to detect @xmath26  events is complicated by the presence of cp even and odd decay components which have different lifetimes . finally normalizing to the mode",
    "@xmath26  does not eliminate the systematic uncertainty from the ratio @xmath21 since current measurements of the branching ratio of @xmath26  are calculated using the fragmentation ratio .",
    "the expression for @xmath1  is obtained by replacing @xmath10  with @xmath11  and the fragmentation ratio with @xmath28 which is taken as unity .",
    "the limits on the branching ratio @xmath29  are also calculated using the ratio @xmath21  @xcite determined from tevatron data based on the cdf run 1 analysis  @xcite .    to increase the sensitivity",
    "both experiments perform an optimization over the primary discriminating variables , which are based on lifetime , compatibility between the momentum vector of the candidate @xmath27 meson and the vector between the production and decay vertices , and isolation in a cone around the candidate meson , where isolation is defined as the ratio of sum of momenta of the candidate tracks divided by the sum of momenta the candidate tracks and other tracks in the cone .",
    "cdf optimizes for the best limit , and d   for the best sensitivity , where sensitivity is defined as @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is the number of expected background events .",
    "we use a bayesian integration method to calculate the combined limits  @xcite .",
    "the method takes into account correlated and uncorrelated systematic uncertainties between the two experiments , and between the two search channels of the cdf analysis .",
    "the key elements in calculating the limit are estimating central values and uncertainties on the efficiency and acceptance for the trigger and reconstruction , and estimating the background .",
    "these elements are described in the next section , followed by a section on the limit calculation and a final section where the results are summarized .",
    "both experiments evaluate the acceptance and efficiency of their respective triggers , reconstruction code and discriminating variables . by normalizing the limit to the measured decay @xmath4",
    "most of the systematic uncertainties of these estimates cancel in the ratio .",
    "the sources of systematic uncertainties in the cdf and d  analyses are discussed in detail in references  @xcite .",
    "systematic uncertainties on the estimates of the acceptance and efficiency are uncorrelated since they are based on estimates of trigger and reconstruction efficiencies for different detectors .",
    "systematic uncertainties associated with the production of @xmath27 mesons are possibly correlated since similar event generation programs are used in both analysis .",
    "these systematic uncertainties affect the estimates of the efficiencies of the primary discriminating variables . however , the variables that are used are qualitatively different .",
    "for instance , the strongest discriminator in each analysis is the lifetime variable .",
    "the cdf analysis uses the proper decay time in 3d while d  selects events based on the 2d transverse decay length significance distribution . the discriminating variable used by d",
    "is correlated with momentum where the cdf variable is uncorrelated .",
    "therefore the uncertainties on @xmath21 and @xmath32 are 100% correlated between the two experiments and all other uncertainties are treated as uncorrelated .",
    "the experiments evaluate the background using sideband events .",
    "the uncertainties on the backgrounds are dominated by the statistical uncertainties .",
    "the acceptance , efficiency , and background numbers are summarized in table  [ tab : summary ] .",
    ".[tab : summary ] a summary of the inputs used in equation  [ eq : intro ] to estimate @xmath29 .",
    "the relative uncertainties are given parenthetically .",
    "the single - event - sensitivity , @xmath33 , to a given branching ratio , corresponding to @xmath34 , and the expected limit at 90% confidence level ( cl ) , under a hypothetical repetition of the experiments , are calculated using the inputs .",
    "the combined @xmath33 and expected limit for the cdf `` central '' and `` central - extended '' search channels are also given .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,>,^,>,^ , > \" , ]     the limits were checked using independent programs for bayesian limit integration developed separately by the cdf and d  collaborations .",
    "in addition , the cutoff of the assumed prior distribution was varied and the distributions used for the uncertainties in the calculation were taken as gaussian distributions with a cutoff and gamma functions .",
    "the limits were found to vary by less than 5% under these tests .",
    "we report on a combination of cdf and d   limits on the branching ratios @xmath29  and @xmath35 .",
    "the limits are obtained using a relative normalization to the decay @xmath4 .",
    "the individual limits are combined using a bayesian integration technique that takes into account correlated and uncorrelated systematic uncertainties between the two experiments .",
    "the limits are found to be robust under several tests .",
