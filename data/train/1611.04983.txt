    "spin chains have been at the center of high energy physics , solid state physics , quantum optics and statistical mechanics for many years .",
    "arguably the most famous spin chain is the heisenberg @xmath5 chain @xcite .",
    "bethe s solution @xcite helped to construct multiple generalizations ( see e.g. @xcite ) , with some generalizations playing important roles for example in the context of the ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "some spin chains are solvable in a weaker sense : only the ground state , and perhaps a few other eigenstates , can be described analytically .",
    "the best - known example for such a chain is the aklt chain @xcite .",
    "chains where the ground state can be efficiently described are often `` frustration free '' in that the ground state is a common ground state of the individual local terms comprising the hamiltonian .",
    "we are searching for solvable spin chains with a high level of quantum fluctuations .",
    "such fluctuations manifest themselves in the entropy of subsystems even when the complete state of the system is known , in contrast with classical systems .",
    "indeed , in a classical theory of random variables , a zero entropy state implies that the probability measure is concentrated on one particular realization .",
    "thus all local variables have definite values , and in particular , there is no entropy in any sub - system .",
    "this is not true in the quantum case , where a sub - system can have enhanced entropy if strong quantum fluctuations are present even under the condition that the total entropy is zero .    for spin chains ,",
    "the usual setup is to find a hamiltonian with a unique ground state , ensuring that the entropy of the total quantum state is zero .",
    "let us consider a block of spins [ in the ground state ] of length @xmath1 in a spin - chain with only local interactions .",
    "how does the entropy of the block behave as @xmath1 increases ?",
    "for gap - full spin - chains in 1d the entropy is bounded @xcite as @xmath6 , this behavior is conjectured to be typical also in higher dimensional systems , and is often referred to as an area law scaling ( for a review see , e.g. @xcite ) . for many gapless chains",
    "the entropy increases logarithmically with the growth of @xmath1 , which is the typical behavior for conformal field theories @xcite .",
    "logarithmic violations of area law behavior are also typical for gapless fermion models in higher dimensions @xcite .",
    "however , it has been recently realized that entropy can grow much faster : indeed as fast as the ( maximally possible ) volume scaling .",
    "one way to achieve this is , of course , allowing for non - local terms in the hamiltonian that can generate long - range correlations , as studied , e.g. in @xcite ) .",
    "however , most physical systems are well described by local hamiltonians , thus we stress the fact that we are considering here strictly local spin - chains with enhanced entropy . even within the restriction of strict locality , a special spin chain with entropy scaling as fast as volume was found in @xcite .",
    "in addition , particular examples of systems with volume scaling , but with hamiltonians that are not translationally invariant have been presented in @xcite .",
    "recently , the existence of an entire quantum critical phase , featuring extensive entanglement has been demonstrated for a class of spin - chains @xcite .",
    "the phase is characterized by a linear scaling of entropy and has a phase transition into an area law regime .",
    "with respect to certain variables ( color ) , the ground state may be thought of as a `` rainbow '' state where pairs of spins diametrically opposite the middle of the chain are strongly entangled .",
    "such a state has been discussed in terms of tensor network states and even produced in the laboratory using photonics states entangled on the frequency comb @xcite , moreover , it has been shown that this type of state may be generated in a free fermion model with a local hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the free fermion model is very useful as direct numerical simulations are possible .",
    "however , unfortunately , the coupling constants are not translationally invariant : in particular , this means that when going to a large system limit , new sites are added to the system with couplings that must be explicitly tuned , and are different from the couplings already existing in the bulk of the original system .",
    "this limitation makes it hard to discuss quantum phases , as even at finite temperatures thermodynamic quantities such as free energy would not scale with the volume as they would for any translationally invariant system .",
    "the transition point itself ( area law and extensive entropy ) , is very interesting and described by the motzkin spin chain model of @xcite .",
    "it is novel as it is different from many of the quantum critical points studied before ( which are most often described by conformal field theories ) and has entropy scaling as the square root of the volume . in this model the ground state",
    "is represented by a superposition of so - called colored motzkin paths and the extensive entropy phase of @xcite is obtained by deforming the hamiltonian to have a particular weighted type of superposition favoring highly entangled states .",
    "another square root enhancement of entanglement has also been recently demonstrated in the fredkin spin chain of @xcite . the fredkin spin chain is a direct generalization of the @xmath5 spin chain :",
    "neighboring spins switch on and off the heisenberg interaction ( see formula ( 3 ) of @xcite ) .",
    "the fredkin chain has a unique ground state : it is a uniform superposition of dyck paths .",
    "much as in the motzkin chain of @xcite , the colorless case features entanglement entropy scales as @xmath7 while in the colored case the entropy scales as @xmath8 .",
    "here we introduce a deformed fredkin chain that is a new example of the extensively entangled critical phase of @xcite , showing that this is a feature in a larger class of systems . owing to the 3-term fredkin interaction ,",
    "the treatment of the ground state involves dyck paths rather than motzkin paths ( appearing in @xcite ) and makes the analysis simpler to carry out .",
    "the coefficient of the volume law scaling is enhanced compared to the deformed motzkin chain of @xcite from @xmath9 to @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the local hilbert space dimension .",
    "in particular , the counting of dyck paths that we use is intimately related to interesting problems whose combinatorics have been extensively studied , namely the enumeration of young diagrams .",
    "we first explain the relationship between dyck path and spin @xmath0 chains .",
    "a dyck path on @xmath12 steps is any path from @xmath13 to @xmath14 with steps @xmath15 and @xmath16 that never passes below the @xmath17-axis .",
    "when we regard a @xmath15 step a local up - spin as and a @xmath16 step as a local down - spin , the dyck path corresponds to a state of @xmath12 spins .",
    "the unique ground state of a fredkin spin chain is a uniform superposition of dyck paths . when the @xmath18th step is assigned a color @xmath19 , picked among a set of @xmath4 colors",
    ", @xmath20 is a spin @xmath21 state . in this way ,",
    "the local hilbert space dimension is @xmath22 .",
    "the ground state of the fredkin model with a color degree of freedom is a uniform superposition of colored dyck paths @xcite .",
    "we introduce the hamiltonian of a deformed fredkin spin chain with the parameter @xmath23 while remaining frustration free .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath24 here @xmath25 with @xmath26.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the boundary conditions , that the first step in a dyck path is upwards and the last step is downwards , are implemented by : @xmath27 note that we are using here the parameter @xmath23 as a deformation parameter , as opposed to @xmath28 which is often used to denote deformations . in what comes next",
    "we always take @xmath23 real .",
    "the unique ground state of this model is @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a normalization factor and @xmath31 is the area below the path @xmath32 .",
    "that is the ground state can be verified directly , namely , by checking that @xmath33 is annihilated by each of the projection operators making up the deformed fredkin hamiltonian .",
    "for example , the area under a dyck path containing the spin configuration @xmath34 , will be larger than the area under the same dyck path where the @xmath35 spins have been interchanged ( getting @xmath36 ) by exactly @xmath37 , as illustrated in fig . [ areachange ] .",
    "thus , in the ground state superposition , the relative amplitude between these will be @xmath38 the states will thus be annihilated by the projectors @xmath39 in @xmath40 , . in general , every time a pair of @xmath41 is moved around a third neighbor , the area below the dyck walk changes by a unit of @xmath37 , while the weight of it changes by a factor of @xmath23 . meanwhile , the projections in @xmath42 , are automatically satisfied whenever the colorings obey the rules of colored dyck paths .",
    "therefore the zero energy ground state ( gs ) of the hamiltonian is indeed a superposition of the dyck walks weighted by @xmath23 to the power of the area @xmath31 below them ( which also satisfy the boundary projectors ) .",
    "it is also straightforward to see that the ground state is unique : any other superposition of walks will violate at least one of the projectors and will have non - zero energy .    to study entanglement of half a chain with the rest ,",
    "we rewrite the ground state in the schmidt decomposition form @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 is a weighted superposition of spin configuration with @xmath46 excess @xmath47 , @xmath48 excess @xmath49 and a particular coloring @xmath17 of unmatched arrows .    with these definitions",
    "the entanglement entropy of half a chain is given by : @xmath50",
    "we start with a deformation of the colorless fredkin model , namely the case of @xmath2 and @xmath52 .",
    "we define @xmath53 .",
    "[ lem1 ] when @xmath2 and @xmath52 , @xmath54 satisfies the following inequality and equation @xmath55 @xmath56 where @xmath57 is an @xmath1 independent constant .     in eq.([1 ] ) is the partition function @xmath58 when @xmath59 .",
    "however , when @xmath60 , the coefficient of @xmath61 is less than @xmath58 because the area where we can make the young diagram is restricted.,width=302 ]     and the associated young diagram.,width=264 ]    @xmath62 + we first note that there is no path which stops at @xmath63 where @xmath64 is odd .",
    "therefore , @xmath65 for odd @xmath64 , eq",
    "..    next , we consider the case of even @xmath64 . writing explicitly the normalization factor",
    "@xmath66 the coefficient of a term like @xmath67 in eq.([1 ] ) is the number of dyck paths of area @xmath68 .",
    "we note that : @xmath69 where @xmath58 is the integer partition of @xmath70 as illustrated in fig .",
    "more precisely , @xmath58 is the number of young diagrams made up of @xmath70 boxes .",
    "@xmath71 is a generating function of integer partitions and is known to converge when @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath72 , and we thus have @xmath73 dyck paths reaching a height @xmath63 , can have at most area @xmath74 ( obtained by going up @xmath75 steps and then making @xmath76 downward steps ) . as fig.[fig2 ] shows , these paths correspond to partitions of @xmath77 where @xmath70 is the number of greyed boxes in fig .",
    "therefore we have : @xmath78 therefore , @xmath79 combining eq.([2 ] ) and eq.([3 ] ) , with the definition we get the following inequality @xmath80    this lemma will be used to prove that the entanglement entropy of half a chain is bounded :    when @xmath2 and @xmath52 , there exists an @xmath1 independent constant @xmath81 such that the entanglement entropy @xmath82 satisfies @xmath83 .",
    "@xmath62 @xmath84 we defined @xmath85 and used lemma 1 in eq.([554 ] ) , eq.([111 ] ) and eq.([999 ] ) .",
    "since the first and the second terms in eq.([09 ] ) are convergent , @xmath81 is an @xmath1 independent constant .",
    "@xmath81 is roughly estimated by @xmath87t^{-2n'^2}=\\frac{c(t)^2}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{2\\log t}}(\\log c(t ) + \\frac{1}{2}).\\ ] ] since @xmath88 when @xmath89 , we have @xmath90 , and @xmath91 . in this limit only the contribution from the dominant path , with area @xmath92 is important .",
    "since there is only one `` highest area '' path , corresponding to the spin configuration @xmath93 , the system is close to being in a product state and clearly not entangled .",
    "we now add the color degree of freedom , and use @xmath64 , @xmath95 and @xmath57 as defined in the previous subsection .",
    "it is useful to relate the probabilities of the colored case to those of the non - colored .",
    "to do so , note that using the definition , eq .",
    ", we have : @xmath96 and @xmath97 in particular , the colored probabilities @xmath98 are related to the uncolored ones by : @xmath99 we are now ready to address the entropy in the colored case .",
    ". allows us to write @xmath100 explicitly in terms of the probabilities @xmath101 of the uncolored case , yielding : @xmath102 for @xmath2 , we have established in theorem 1 that @xmath103 is bounded .",
    "thus the behavior of the entropy is determined by the remainder term in the last equation .",
    "we find that :    when @xmath2 and @xmath104 , the entanglement entropy of ground state @xmath82 satisfies the inequality @xmath105 where @xmath106 is an @xmath1 independent constant .",
    "as we have seen before , @xmath107 , the above theorem shows that @xmath108 .",
    "@xmath62 + as before , we recalling that @xmath109 is even and writing @xmath110 , eq . gives us : @xmath111 using lemma [ lem1 ] we can immediately bound the remainder sum in : @xmath112 where @xmath113 is an @xmath1 independent constant since the sum @xmath114 is convergent for @xmath2 .",
    "this proves the extensivity result for the entropy eq . .",
    "@xmath106 is roughly estimated by @xmath115      in this case , the model has bounded entropy . the area law can be viewed as a consequence of the fact that @xmath117 exponentially favors paths with lowest possible area .",
    "the superposition of lowest height paths , can be written in the form @xmath118 therefore , these paths carry only nearest - neighour non trivial correlations .",
    "longer range entanglement must come from higher paths .",
    "while such paths are more numerous , their amplitude is exponentially suppressed : paths that produce correlations on a distance @xmath11 , say between the spins at site @xmath18 and @xmath119 must stay above the height where they first encountered @xmath18 until they reach @xmath119 such paths have an area at least @xmath120 larger than the lowest area paths , and appear with a relative amplitude of at least @xmath121 in the ground states .",
    "while this argument is intuitively appealing , still , one has to properly account for the fact that such paths are numerous .",
    "below , we establish the boundedness of the entropy for @xmath117 .",
    "for convenience , we make slight changes in notation and introduce the symbols @xmath122 , @xmath123 , defined as : @xmath124 which corresponds to a change in normalization of @xmath125 so that the coefficient of the basis state corresponding to the lowest area path is 1 .",
    "the analog of is then :    @xmath126    this change in normalization ensures that @xmath127 is a strictly increasing function of @xmath1 for arbitrarily small @xmath23 .",
    "this can be shown by observing that @xmath127 obeys the catalan - like recursion relation @xmath128 , with @xmath129 .    when @xmath117 , we have that @xmath130 is bounded by @xmath131    @xmath62 + the key idea here is that the paths counted by @xmath132 can be constructed by inserting unmatched steps into a dyck path of length @xmath109 . inserting an unmatched step at a distance d from the edge increases the area by @xmath133 .",
    "this leads to a term with weight @xmath121 in @xmath134 , where we note that the definition of @xmath134 earlier in this section conveniently eliminates @xmath135 factors .",
    "thus we can bound @xmath132 from above with @xmath136    for any @xmath137 , we have that @xmath138    @xmath62 + we use the definition of @xmath139 , namely @xmath140 where in the last step we observe that the factors of @xmath23 cancel out .",
    "we may then insert the approximation in the previous lemma , which gives us @xmath141 our next step is then simply to observe that since @xmath142 is a monotonously increasing function of @xmath70 and @xmath139 is nonzero only for even @xmath109 , @xmath143 . however , the rhs in this last inequality is simply @xmath144 , meaning that we can write down our final upper bound : @xmath145 which is fully independent of @xmath1 .",
    "[ lem04 ] for @xmath146 , there exists an @xmath147 such that @xmath148    @xmath62 + to show this , we use the fact that all @xmath149 , combined with a coarse upper bound for the approximation in .",
    "that is , we observe that for any @xmath150 , there exists a @xmath151 such that for all @xmath152 , @xmath153 the bound then implies that for @xmath154 we have : @xmath155    for any @xmath150 and s , there exists a constant @xmath156 such that the entropy of the ground state @xmath82 satisfies @xmath157 for all n.    @xmath62 + to show this , we make use of the lemma [ lem04 ] above and eq . .",

    "we have thus established that the entropy is bounded by an @xmath1 independent constant , @xmath169",
    "the search for highly entangled ground states is one of the most important pursuits in the field of many - body entanglement .",
    "precisely because these are not typical , yet are highly interesting and potentially useful .    here we took another step in this direction .",
    "we have introduced a novel highly entangled spin chain , the deformed fredkin spin chain , and studied it s quantum phase diagram .",
    "the model s ground state has a simple interpretation as a superposition of weighted dyck paths . in the colored case ,",
    "it features an extensively entangled critical phase and an area law phase , while entanglement entropy of half the chain scales as a square root at the transition .",
    "besides the high entanglement content of the model , its appeal is the relative simplicity of the interactions and the tractability of the ground state .",
    "the calculation of many more interesting quantities associated with the model is an ongoing project .",
