    "nowadays it is strongly believed that the universe is experiencing an accelerated expansion .",
    "the observation data confirm it such as type ia supernovae @xcite in associated with large scale structure @xcite and cosmic microwave background anisotropies @xcite have provided main evidence for this cosmic acceleration . in order to explain why the cosmic acceleration happens ,",
    "many theories have been proposed .",
    "the standard cosmological model ( scm ) furnishes an accurate description of the evolution of the universe , in spite of its success , the scm suffers from a series of problems such as the initial singularity , the cosmological horizon , the flatness problem , the baryon asymmetry and the nature of dark energy and dark matter , although inflation partially or totally answers some of these problems .",
    "inflation theory was first proposed by guth in 1981 @xcite .",
    "inflation is a period of accelerated expansion in the early universe , it occurs when the energy density of the universe is dominated by the potential energy of some scalar field called inflaton .",
    "currently all successful inflationary scenarios are based on the use of weakly interaction scalar fields .",
    "scalar fields naturally arise in particle physics including string theory and these can act as candidates for dark energy . so far a wide verity of scalar field dark energy models have been proposed .",
    "these include quintessence @xcite , k - essence @xcite , tachyon @xcite , phantoms @xcite , ghost condensates @xcite and so forth .",
    "two main reason for use of scalar fields to explain inflation are natural homogeneity and isotropy of such fields and its ability to imitate a slowly decaying cosmological constant @xcite",
    ". however , no scalar field has ever been observed , and designing models by using unobserved scalar fields undermine their predictability and falsifiability , despite the recent precision data .",
    "the latest theoretical developments ( string landscape ) offer too much freedom for model - building , so higher spin fields generically induce a spatial anisotropy and the effective mass of such fields usually of the order of the hubble scale and the slow - roll inflation dose not occurs @xcite",
    ". then an immediate question is , can we do cosmology without scalar fields ?",
    "the authors of @xcite have shown that a successful vector inflation can be simultaneously surmounted in a natural way , and isotropy of the vector field condensate be achieved either in the case of triplet of mutually orthogonal vector field @xcite . in spite of inflation success in explaining the present state of the universe",
    ", it dose not solve the crucial problem of the initial singularity @xcite .",
    "the existence of an initial singularity is disturbing , because the space - time description breaks down `` there '' .",
    "non - singular universes have been recurrently present in the scientific literature .",
    "bouncing model is one of them that was first proposed by novello and salim @xcite and mlnikov and orlov @xcite in the late 70 s .",
    "at the end of the 90 s the discovery of the acceleration of the universe brought back to the front the idea that @xmath0 could be negative , which is precisely one of the conditions needed for cosmological bounce in gr , and contributed to the revival of nonsingular universes . bouncing universe are those that go from an era of acceleration collapse to an expanding era without displaying a singularity @xcite .",
    "necessary conditions required for a successful bounce during the contracting phase , the scale factor @xmath1 is decreasing , i.e. @xmath2 , and in the expanding phase we have @xmath3 . at the bouncing point , @xmath4 , and around this point",
    "@xmath5 for a period of time .",
    "equivalently in the bouncing cosmology the hubble parameter h runs across zero from @xmath6 to @xmath7 and @xmath8 at the bouncing point .",
    "a successful bounce requires around this point . +",
    "the remainder of the paper is as follows . in section 2 and 3",
    ", we will consider vector field action where proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite and study bouncing solution of this model . in section 4 and 5 , we will reconstruct physical quantities for this model and also will plot the corresponding graphs .",
    "finally we will apply three parametrization and compare them for this model .",
    "we consider a massive vector field , which is non - minimally coupled to gravity , @xcite .",
    "the action is given by    @xmath9    where @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is a dimensionless parameter for non - minimal coupling .",
    "we note that , the non - minimal coupling of vector field is same with conformal coupling of a scalar field in case @xmath12 .",
    "we adopt frw universe with the metric signature of @xmath13 .",
    "+ the equations of motion are given by @xmath14,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath15    where the right hand side of equation ( [ e2 ] ) is the energy - momentum tensor of the vector field @xmath16 .",
    "the variation of the action with respect to @xmath16 yields the following equations of motion , @xmath17 @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the scale factor , the dot denotes the derivative with respect to the cosmic time and the summation over repeated spatial indices is satisfied . by considering the quasi - homogeneous vector field @xmath20 and eq .",
    "( [ e4 ] ) imply @xmath21 , so that from eq .",
    "( [ e5 ] ) we obtain @xmath22 by using acceleration relation @xmath23 we achieve as , @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are hubble s parameter , ricci scalar and first component of ricci tensor , respectively . as we know",
    ", a dynamical vector field has generally a preferred direction , and to introduce such a vector field may not be consistent with the isotropy of the universe .",
    "in fact , the energy - momentum tensor of the vector field @xmath28 has anisotropic components .",
    "however , the anisotropic part of the energy - momentum tensor can be eliminated by introducing a triplet of mutually orthogonal vector fields . in that case",

    "we solve numerically eq . ( [ e6 ] ) for @xmath41 which implies the flat , close and open universe respectively .",
    "the fig.1 shows graph of the vector field with respect to time in all of cases @xmath42 .",
    "one can see where vector field has oscillation behavior and the magnitude slowly decrease with respect to time evolution . also by increasing the parameter @xmath11 , the magnitude of vector field will increase , but the period of oscillation is constant .",
    "we note that negative values of @xmath11 actually is the same of above result .",
    "as above mention we suggest following solution for @xmath43 @xmath44 where the parameter @xmath45 describes the oscillating amplitude of the field with dimension of @xmath46 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "also @xmath45 is relation with the parameter @xmath11 , this solution implies the damping magnitude of the oscillating vector field .",
    "we will start with a detailed examination on the necessary conditions required for a successful bounce . during the contracting phase , the scale factor @xmath1 is decreasing , i.e. , @xmath47 , and in the expanding phase we have @xmath48 . at the bouncing point @xmath49 and around this point",
    "@xmath50 for a period of time .",
    "equivalently in the bouncing cosmology the hubble parameter @xmath51 runs across zero from @xmath52 to @xmath53 and @xmath54 at the bouncing point .",
    "a successful bounce requires around this point @xmath55 at the point where the bounce occurs , eqs .",
    "( [ e8 ] ) and ( [ e9 ] ) reduce to @xmath56 @xmath57 on the other hand , a successful bounce from eqs .",
    "( [ e6 ] ) , ( [ e7 ] ) and ( [ e16 ] ) obtain in the form , @xmath58    this result is similar to slow roll inflation .",
    "this means that one requires a flat potential where give rise to a point bounce for the model of vector field . from conditions ( [ e16 ] ) , ( [ e19 ] )",
    "it is clear that if we have bouncing solutions in open universe , then we have such behaviour for flat and closed universe as well .",
    "now we solve above equation numerically by different value of @xmath11 on the curved universe that is plotted in fig .",
    "2 . +   +    one can see the hubble parameter @xmath51 running across zero in any three cases of @xmath59 . in all cases of @xmath59",
    ", we have @xmath52 to @xmath53 where implies to go from collapse era to an expanding era , and this result will not change for the different values @xmath11 in all of @xmath59 . also in fig.3 , we can see the behaviour of scale factor in terms of time for different values of @xmath59 .",
    "it is clear that during the contracting phase , the scale factor @xmath1 is decreasing , i.e. , @xmath60 , and in the expanding phase we have @xmath50 , so the point where @xmath61 is bouncing point .",
    "+ therefore , in the vector field dominated universe we have a successful bouncing point in close and flat universe but a turn - around point in open universe .",
    "the bounce can be attributed to the negative - energy matter , which dominates at small values of @xmath19 and create a significant enough repulsive force so that a big crunch is avoided .",
    "now we are going to present a reconstruction process for vector field in the curved universe by @xmath12 . in this section ,",
    "potential and kinetic energy are reconstructed with respect to redshirt @xmath62 .",
    "also we obtain the eos in term of @xmath62 .",

    "@xmath91 also we have following expression for deceleration parameter q @xmath92 now we consider the stability of this model by use the hydrodynamic analogy and judge on stability by examining the value of the sound speed .",
    "of course this is a simple approach , the perturbations in vector inflation are much richer than in hydrodynamic model , see recent interesting works in .",
    "the sound speed can be obtained by the following equation , @xmath93 in order to deal the stability of our model , the sound speed must become @xmath94 , so we can obtain from above equation following condition @xmath95",
