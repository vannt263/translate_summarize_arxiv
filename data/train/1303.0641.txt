    "this work continues our studies of the landau - zener tunneling ( lz - tunneling ) for a quantum particle in the hall configuration @xcite . to be certain , here we assume a charged particle in electric and magnetic fields ,",
    "although the results are equally applied to a neutral particle ( for example , an atom in an optical lattice ) subject to artificial gauge and potential fields . specifically , we consider the following system @xmath0 + v(x , y)+e(f_x x+f_y y ) \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the magnitude of a magnetic field , @xmath2 an electric field , and @xmath3 the periodic potential .",
    "for @xmath4 the spectrum of the system ( [ 1 ] ) consists of bloch bands separated by energy gaps . it is well know that a strong electric field induces landau - zener transitions ( tunneling ) across the energy gaps . in our previous work",
    "@xcite we have shown that these transitions also take place in the presence of a magnetic field and calculated the tunneling rate .",
    "unfortunately , the analytical approach of ref .",
    "@xcite provides only the rate of tunneling but is incapable to describe dynamics of the system ( [ 1 ] ) if lz - tunneling is not negligible . in the present work we study dynamical manifestations of lz - tunneling by numerically solving the schrdinger equation with the hamiltonian ( [ 1 ] ) and comparing the results with those obtained on the basis of the tight - binding model ( tb - model ) , @xmath5 which is believed to approximate the hamiltonian ( [ 1 ] ) in the case of negligible lz - tunneling . in eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) @xmath6 are the hopping matrix elements in two orthogonal directions , @xmath7 is the lattice period , @xmath8 and @xmath9 label lattice sites , and @xmath10 is the peierls phase , @xmath11 it should be mentioned that the tight - binding approximation implicitly assumes a deep lattice . for the considered periodic potential this requires @xmath12 ,",
    "where @xmath13 .",
    "if the later condition is satisfied the ground bloch band of the one - dimentional hamiltonians @xmath14 , @xmath15 ( @xmath16 is given by the similar equation ) are well approximated by the cosine function , @xmath17 .",
    "thus the next to neighboring hopping terms can be indeed neglected in the hamiltonian ( [ 2 ] ) . in what follows we measure the energy in units of @xmath18 , the length in units of @xmath7 ( which we set to @xmath19 ) , and drop all physical constants .    , left , and squared absolute values of the amplitudes @xmath20 , right , for @xmath21 .",

    "we begin with comparing dynamics of the systems ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) for @xmath23 .",
    "we solve the time - dependent schrdinger equation with the hamiltonian ( [ 1 ] ) on the grid and check the convergence of the results with respect to the space and time discretization .",
    "having the wave - function obtained , we calculate its overlap with the wannier functions @xmath25 associated with the ground bloch band of the hamiltonian @xmath26 : @xmath27 finally the probability amplitudes ( [ b1 ] ) are compared with those calculated on the basis of the tight - binding hamiltonian ( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "a remark concerning initial conditions is in order . to facilitate comparison with tb - model we choose @xmath28 ,",
    "that corresponds to population of the single site , @xmath29 .",
    "notice that this initial state assumes population of the whole ground bloch band if @xmath4 or all ground magnetic bands if @xmath30 @xcite . as an example the left panel in fig .",

    "the depicted in the right panel populations of the lattice sites are undistinguishable by eye from those obtained on the basis of tb - model .",

    "the dash - dotted line shows the decrease of total probability in the case @xmath33 due to absorbing boundary conditions.,width=377 ]    as an overall characteristic of the system dynamics we consider the participation ratio @xmath35 the dashed line in the upper panel in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] depicts @xmath36 calculated by using tb - model .",
    "the participation ratio shows oscillatory dynamics , superimposed with a slow increase in its mean value .",
    "this slow increase is due to finite widths of the magnetic bands , which implies ballistic dynamics for asymptotic times @xcite .",
    "the dashed line should be compared with the solid line , which is calculated by using the original hamiltonian .",
    "although qualitative correspondence is noticed , quantitative agreement holds only for finite time .",
    "the reason for the observed deviations is a relatively large value of @xmath10 used in our numerical simulations .",
    "in fact , if @xmath30 the condition @xmath37 alone is not enough to justify the tight - binding hamiltonian .",
    "the other necessary condition , which is often overlooked when deriving ( [ 2 ] ) from the continuous hamiltonian ( [ 1 ] ) , is @xmath38 . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath39 dynamics of the system ( [ 1 ] ) is not restricted to the subspace of the hilbert space spanned by the ground wannier states @xmath25 , even if the initial wave - function belongs to this subspace .",
    "this statement is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] which shows the projection of the wave function on the specified subspace , @xmath40 obviously , the smaller @xmath41 , the closer @xmath42 is to unity . however , smaller @xmath10 require larger lattices and longer evolution time to see characteristic features of the system dynamics .",
    "our choice @xmath43 is a compromise between accuracy of the tight - binding approximation and complexity ( computational time ) of numerical simulations .",
    "next we consider the case @xmath44 and @xmath4 . for @xmath4 dynamics of the system ( [ 1 ] ) are bloch oscillations , where the mean position ( normal mode ) or the width ( breathing mode ) of a localized wave packet oscillates with the bloch frequencies @xmath45 simultaneously , the oscillating wave packet emits sub - packets , which get accelerated by the electric field and move away from the main packet along the crystallographic axes of the lattice @xcite .",
    "this dynamics is exemplified in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , which shows @xmath46 for @xmath47 and @xmath48 , after evolution time @xmath49 . for the chosen electric field configuration the sub - packets move in the negative @xmath50 direction while the packet itself spreads in the @xmath51 direction .",
    "since in numerical simulations we are forced to deal with finite lattices , we impose periodic boundary conditions at @xmath52 and absorbing boundary conditions at @xmath53 . for this setup",
    "the system quickly reaches quasi stationary state , where time - average occupation probabilities of the lattice sites do not depend on @xmath54 .",
    "notice that due to absorbing boundary condition the total probability decay in time .",
    "the dash - dotted and dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] show the total probability and the projection ( [ b4 ] ) on the subspace spanned by the ground ws - states .",
    "these two curves are seen to follow each other .",
    "thus , unlike the case of null electric field , deviations from tb - model are now exclusively due to irreversible lz - tunneling to higher bands .     at @xmath49 for vanishing magnetic field .",
    "the system parameters are @xmath22 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48.,width=377 ]    along with the quantity ( [ b4 ] ) the other important characteristics of the system is the mean kinetic energy @xmath55 of the particle .",
    "since the total energy is conserved , an increase in the kinetic energy is compensated by decrease in the stark energy @xmath56 it is easy to prove that @xmath57 infinitely grows due to lz - tunneling .",
    "this is in strong contrast with the case @xmath30 , which we shall study systematically in the next section . for the moment",
    "we only mention that a finite @xmath1 prohibits infinite increase / decrease in the kinetic / stark energy and imposes an upper boundary for possible energies of the quantum particle .",
    "this boundary can be estimated by using the classical arguments as follows .    , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath48.,width=377 ]",
    "let us consider classical counterpart of the hamiltonian ( [ 1 ] ) where , for the sake of simplicity , we assume @xmath48 . let us also assume that the particle is initially located at @xmath60 and its energy is slightly higher than the potential barrier in the @xmath50 direction .",
    "then , for finite time defined below , the particle is accelerated by the electric field in the @xmath50 direction and @xmath61 . during this initial stage",
    "the motion in the @xmath51 direction is oscillations around the central local minimum of the effective potential @xmath62 .",
    "it is easy to see that this local minimum disappears if @xmath63 , where @xmath64 at this time the particle escapes the central valley of the 2d potential with the kinetic energy @xmath65 as soon as the particle escapes the valley its further trajectory becomes usual cycloid , see fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , where the kinetic and stark energies oscillates around @xmath66 .",
    "the above analysis can be easily generalized for other directions of the electric field vector , resulting in the same estimate .",
    "it should be also mentioned that eq .",
    "( [ b7 ] ) gives the maximal escape time .",
    "if we consider an ensemble of particles with slightly different initial conditions , we get different escape times and , as the consequence , a broad distribution for the kinetic / stark energies .",
    "we proceed with the case of @xmath44 and @xmath30 .",
    "first we consider the situation where @xmath67 is aligned with the @xmath50 axis . figure [ fig8 ] shows @xmath46 for @xmath33 and @xmath43 ( @xmath68 ) and should be compared with fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] where @xmath4 .",
    "qualitative difference between two figures is that in the former case the tunneling particle acquires finite velocity in the @xmath51 direction , which is consistent with the classical dynamics considered in sec .",
    "we calculated the mean current along the @xmath51 direction , which was found to differ from zero .",
    "notice that tb - model predicts zero current for the considered initial condition .",
    "thus a finite current in the @xmath51 direction can be considered a manifestation of lz - tunneling .",
    "unfortunately , we have not been able to find the actual value of the current . to do",
    "this one should move the absorbing boundary further to negative @xmath50 till the convergence is reached .",
    "[ according to the estimate ( [ b7 ] ) this requires the lattice of the order of 1000 sites , which is beyond our computational capabilities . ] in this case we also expect to see a qualitative difference in the tails of the reduced probability @xmath69 see fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , which defines the stark energy ( [ b6 ] ) trough the equation @xmath70 . based on the classical consideration , if @xmath30 the reduced probability is expected to decay faster than @xmath71 which ensures finite kinetic and stark energies . on the contrary ,",
    "if @xmath4 the reduced probability should show a diverging tail because the stark and kinetic energies infinitely increase when @xmath72 .     at @xmath49 .",
    "parameters are @xmath22 , @xmath43 ( @xmath68 ) , @xmath47 , and @xmath48.,width=377 ]     at @xmath49 in the logarithmic scale .",
    "the solid and dashed lines correspond to @xmath43 and @xmath73 , respectively.,width=340 ]    finally we consider the case of an irrational direction of the electric field @xmath34 .",
    "as shown in the recent works @xcite devoted to dynamical and spectral properties of the system ( [ 2 ] ) , in this case the electric field localizes the particle in the lattice , where the localization length tends to one site for @xmath74 . notice that this result holds for both zero and finite magnetic fields",
    ". numerical simulations of the original system for @xmath33 partially confirm this conclusion : when plotting the wave - packet in the linear scale we observe that only 3 - 4 sites participates in the dynamics .",
    "moreover , if we normalize the amplitudes ( [ b1 ] ) against @xmath42 the participation ratio ( [ b3 ] ) practically coincides with that calculated on the basis of tb - model , see lower panel in fig .",
    "however , when plotting the wave packet in the logarithmic scale we clearly see the effect of lz - tunneling , as well as the qualitative difference between the cases @xmath4 and @xmath30 , see fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] .     at @xmath49 for @xmath73 (",

    "the other parameters are @xmath22 , @xmath33 , and @xmath75.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]",
    "we analyzed lz - tunneling for a charged particle in a square lattice subjected to normal to the lattice plane magnetic field @xmath1 and in - plane electric field @xmath76 .",
    "for @xmath4 the rate of lz - tunneling is defined by the size of the energy gap @xmath77 separating the ground bloch band from the rest of the spectrum and the magnitude of the electric field .",
    "if the rate of this tunneling is not negligible ( strong electric fields ) , the ground bloch band rapidly depletes and the particle is accelerated towards infinite kinetic energy  the phenomenon known as electric breakdown .",
    "we showed that a finite magnetic field essentially modifies this phenomenon , where the effect of the magnetic field is twofold .",
    "first , the magnetic field splits bloch bands into magnetic bands , thus introducing the new energy gaps . according to results of our previous work @xcite ,",
    "now the rate of tunneling across the main energy gap @xmath77 is either smaller or larger than that for @xmath4 , depending on which magnetic band is initially populated .",
    "however , as the first approximation , one can neglect this effect and use the standard landau - zener equation to estimate the rate of tunneling .",
    "numerical results presented in this work undoubtedly confirm this conclusion of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the other effect of the magnetic field , which can not be neglected , is that the tunneled particle is accelerated only to a finite kinetic energy , that is in strong contrast with the case @xmath4 .",
    "using classical arguments we estimated the upper boundary for the particle kinetic energy , see eq .",
    "( [ b8 ] ) . after the acceleration stage ,",
    "the further dynamics of the classical particle is a drift in the direction orthogonal to the vector @xmath67 , i.e. , the hall current .",
    "our numerical simulations of the quantum system clearly indicate the presence of this current .",
    "thus , the electric breakdown in the presence of a magnetic field should be interpreted as appearance of the hall current .",
