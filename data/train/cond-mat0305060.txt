    "since their first experimental demonstration @xcite , magnetic field tunable interactions have proven their potential and usefulness in the physics of quantum degenerate gases .",
    "this technique takes advantage of the zeeman effect in the electronic energy levels of the atoms to manipulate their binary collision properties in the vicinity of a feshbach resonance . for several atomic species it is now possible to change the scattering length by orders of magnitude , and even to reverse its sign , making the atoms either repel or attract one another .",
    "one of the impressive applications of this technique was the successful creation of stable @xmath1rb bose - einstein condensates with thousands of atoms @xcite , that would otherwise collapse if consisting of more than about 80 atoms .",
    "these experiments have now been refined to associate pairs of atoms to ultracold molecules and probe their coherence properties @xcite .",
    "the dissociation energies of the highly excited dimer molecules have been measured accurately down to several khz @xcite .",
    "early attempts to associate feshbach molecules in bose - einstein condensates @xcite relied upon linear ramps of the magnetic field strength across the resonance position , in which the resonance level ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) was swept upward in energy @xcite .",
    "subsequent theoretical studies @xcite have shown that these particular ramps lead to a heating of the cloud rather than to molecular production .",

    "several approaches have been proposed to describe the conversion of condensate atoms into bound or continuum molecular states ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "early approaches are based either on mean field theory , with an exchange of particles between the atomic condensate and the feshbach resonance level ( e.g.  @xcite ) , or on a two - body configuration interaction picture , extended in such a way that it includes the bose stimulation of the transition between free atom pairs and the resonance level @xcite . while these approaches effectively include only two energy levels of the atom pairs , i.e.  the zero energy scattering state and the feshbach resonance level @xcite , the interferometric experiments in ref .",
