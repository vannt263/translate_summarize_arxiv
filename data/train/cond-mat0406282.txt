    "thin films of insulating materials on metal surfaces are of direct technological interest in microelectronics , catalysis and as a corrosive protection .",
    "they are also attracting increasing interest for nanoscience and nanotechnology as potential substrates for atomic and molecular manipulation by the scanning tunneling microscope .",
    "in particular , this interest stems from the possibility to decrease the electronic interaction of assembled molecules and adatoms with the metal support .",
    "the non - vanishing electron density that reaches through the ultrathin insulating films , thickness below 1 nm , allows for these surfaces to be studied by means of stm  @xcite .",
    "a most important prerequisite for the realization of this possibility is to be able to grow stable and atomically thin insulating films on metal surfaces with a well - characterized and ordered geometric structure .",
    "so far the number of systems studied that fulfills these conditions have been very limited  @xcite .",
    "one interesting candidate is provided by nacl overlayers on a stepped cu(311 ) surface , which we have studied in detail by scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm )  @xcite and also most recently by density functional calculations  @xcite .    these experimental and theoretical studies revealed several interesting aspects of the growth , structure and bonding of these systems .",
    "the initial growth of nacl on the cu(311 ) surface was found to be two dimensional and commensurate .",
    "the lattice match of the overlayer with the substrate was suggested in the experimental study to be stabilized by the incomplete screening of the step cu atoms resulting in an electrostatic interaction between these atoms and the cl atoms .",
    "density functional calculations corroborated this suggestion and showed also that the bonding of the overlayer on the surface was further stabilized by the formation of a weak chemical bond between the step cu atoms and the cl stoms .",
    "these calculations revealed also large relaxations of the monolayers such as a buckling of the layer with a large influence on the work function .",
    "these results call for a detailed scanning tunneling microscopy study of the topography of and the tunneling conductance through these overlayers . in particular , the imaging of insulating overlayers on metal surfaces for biases well below 1 v has not been studied before .    in this paper ,",
    "we present atomically resolved topographical images of nacl mono- , bi- and tri - layers on cu(311 ) obtained by an stm and discuss them in relation to simulated images based on density functional calculations and the tersoff - hamann ( th ) approximation  @xcite . in this approximation , stm images and scanning tunneling spectra are obtained from the local density of states ( ldos ) at the position of the tip apex .",
    "the conductivity of the sample are further investigated using scanning tunneling spectroscopy .",
    "the measured @xmath0 spectra are compared with simulated spectra and discussed in relation to the energy dependence of the calculated ldos .",
    "this study includes also a calculation and discussion of the apparent heights and work functions of these layers obtained from tunneling measurements .",
    "the apparent height of an nacl overlayer contains information about the `` local '' work function , that is , the tunneling barrier .",
    "the tunneling barriers are obtained from the measured distance dependence of the tunneling conductance .",
    "stm investigations of insulating overlayers provide important information about the growth mechanisms and the local electronic structure of the overlayer . in earlier stm investigations of ultrathin insulating overlayers on metal surfaces such as mgo on ag(100 )",
    "@xcite and nacl on al(111 ) and al(100 )  @xcite the experiments were carried out at relatively high biases of about 1ev to provide atomic resolution of the overlayer .",
    "atomically resolved stm images have also been observed for nacl layers on ge(100 ) @xcite , where only one type of atoms was found to be imaged as a protrusion  @xcite .",
    "a combined stm and density functional study of nacl layers on an al(111 ) and al(100 ) surface revealed that only the cl atoms were imaged as protrusions . in this work , the atomic contrast as well as the apparent height of the nacl layers was discussed by comparing the experimental images with calculations of ldos within the th approximation .",
    "mgo layers on an ag(100 ) surface were studied using measured @xmath0 spectroscopy and the band gap of the bulk mgo electronic structure was found to be developed within the first three monolayers @xcite .",
    "this finding was corroborated by density functional calculatrions of the energy dependence of the ldos within the mgo layers .",

    "note that the measured apparent barrier height and the calculated work function can not be compared directly . from the calculations we are able to understand the reduction of @xmath17 upon adsorption and its layer dependence in terms of bonding and buckling of the monolayer .",
    "this explanation was discussed in detail in our previous study  @xcite and will only be summarized here .    in general , the surface contribution to @xmath17",
    "is determined by the surface dipole layer , which have contributions both from electronic and ion - core rearrangements upon adsorption .",
    "the reduction of @xmath17 upon adsorption was argued to be caused by the formation of a weak chemical bond between the cl atoms and the metal substrate and the screening of the na@xmath2 ion by the metal electrons .",
    "the substantially smaller reduction of @xmath17 for the monolayer than for the bilayer and the trilayer is caused by the large buckling of the monolayer with a large inward relaxation of the na@xmath2 ions relative to the cl@xmath51 ions , resulting in a dipole layer that increases the work function .",
    "this buckling is substantially reduced for the bilayer and the trilayer and the work function reductions for these layers are governed mostly by the electronic rearrangements , which are limited to the interface region . the measured @xmath17 is thus consistent with a buckling of the monolayer and an interface bonding that involves electron rearrangements between the overlayer and the substrate .",
    "next we turn to a comparison and a discussion of observed and simulated stm images for the bare surface and the overlayers .",
    "these images contain information about the surface electronic and geometric structure through the tails of the wave functions in the vacuum region .",
    "since the th approximation for the tunneling is not based on any detailed model for the tip @xmath29 density of states , we are not able to determine the distance , @xmath52 , between the tip apex and the surface cu layer from the tunneling conductance .",
    "however , the bare surface and the two monolayers were imaged under identical tunneling conditions so we can use the image for the bare surface to calibrate the value of the @xmath32 in the calculation of the ldos images and to make a prediction of the images for the monolayers .    for the bare cu surface",
    ", the calculated ldos image gives the same tip - surface corrugation across the cu rows as the stm image at an average @xmath52 of about 6.1  .",
    "no corrugation could be resolved along the cu rows , neither in the ldos image nor in the stm image .",
    "in contrast to the flat single crystal metal surfaces for which the th approximation fails to reproduce atomically resolved stm images  @xcite , the measured tip - surface corrugation can be reproduced by a realistic value for @xmath52 , for which the th approximation should be applicable . for the flat metal surfaces ,",
    "the imaging mechanism has been argued to involve a direct tip - surface interaction  @xcite .    in figs .",
    "[ fig : ldos_c2x2 ] and  [ fig : ldos_p1x1 ] , we show the calculated ldos images for the investigated monolayers , using the same value of @xmath32 as for the bare surface that reproduced the observed surface corrugation .",
    "the corresponding average value of @xmath52 is 7.9  .",
    "the resulting ldos images are in overall good agreement with the observed stm images although the corrugation is somewhat larger in the ldos images than in the stm images .",
    "the ldos images support our original interpretation of the observed stm images that the protrusions correspond to cl atoms  @xcite . the dominant contribution from the states of the cl atom to the tunneling",
    "is understood from the participation of the @xmath30 states in the bond as indicated by the corresponding partial density of states in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdos ] .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ldos_c2x2 ] , the ldos image for the p(3x2)-ii monolayer reproduces nicely the experimental observation that every second cl is imaged slightly brighter . in our calculations",
    "we attribute the brighter protrusions to be derived from cl atoms at bridge sites .",
    "this difference in brightness corresponds to a difference in @xmath52 of about 0.054  and is consistent with larger adsorption height , @xmath22 , of 0.07  ( see table [ tab : positions ] ) for the cl atoms at the bridge sites than at the top sites .",
    "however , the hybridization of the @xmath53 states of the cl atoms with the metal states at the fermi level is found to be stronger for the top site than for the bridge site .",
    "this electronic effect counteracts in part the geometric effect on the tip - surface corrugation .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ldos_p1x1 ] , the tendency of pairing of the protrusions in the stm image for the p(3x2)-i monolayer is well reproduced by the ldos image .",
    "this pair formation reflects the geometric relaxations of the cl atoms along the cu rows , resulting in two different cl ",
    "cl distances , which differ by 0.16  ( see table [ tab : positions ] ) .",
    "however , the geometric relaxations contribute only a minor part to the difference in distance of about 0.9  between protrusions along the rows .",
    "so in this case the dominant part of this difference is an electronic structure effect associated with the tilting of the cu ",
    "cl bond and the hybridized @xmath53 states of cl with respect to the surface normal .    in comparing stm and ldos images of the bilayer",
    "we can not adopt the same unambiguous procedure for the choice of average @xmath52 as we used for the monolayers . the bare surface and the bilayer",
    "are never imaged under the same tunneling conditions because the monolayer is fully developed before the formation of the bilayer .",
    "however , in our comparison with the stm image we use the same value for @xmath54 as above , which corresponds to an average @xmath52 of 9.0  . as for the monolayers we find that the protrusions in the ldos image for the bilayer shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ldos_2 ] correspond to cl atoms . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdos ] , there is still a contribution from cl states to the partial dos around the fermi level .",
    "this contribution is much smaller than for the cl atom in the interface layer but is compensated by the average distance of the tip from the outermost nacl layer being only about 3.5  for the bilayer , which is about 2 shorter than the corresponding distance for the monolayer with the same value of @xmath54 .",
    "the agreement between the ldos and stm image with respect to amplitude of the surface corrugation is about the same as for the two monolayers but in contrast to the stm image the protrusions are more diffuse and paired into dimers in the ldos image .",
    "this pairing is a pure electronic structure effect because the distances between cl atoms across the rows are the same even though the atoms are inequivalent .",
    "note that the distance of about 3.5  between the tip and the outermost nacl layer is slightly too short to justify the th approximation and an enhancement of the contrast from tip - surface interaction can not be ruled out  @xcite . in particular , the tip - surface distance is even shorter for the tri- and quadrolayers so the observed atomic resaolution might be caused by the tip - surface interactions being sensitive to the identity of the underlying atom .",
    "the apparent heights @xmath4 of the single steps on the nacl multilayer @xmath55 provide indirect information about the conductance through the layers .",
    "for example , @xmath4 is equal to zero or the geometrical height for a multilayer @xmath55 of vacuum or cu , respectively . because bulk nacl is a wide - gap insulator with a calculated band gap of 5.0 ev  @xcite ,",
    "the electrons around the fermi level have to tunnel through the film so its conductance should be substantially less than an cu layer , resulting in a smaller apparent height than the geometrical height .    as shown in table  [",
    "tab : workfunction ] , the calculated @xmath4 are in good agreement with the experimentally measured @xmath4 for the mono- and bi- layers and are indeed appreciably smaller than their geometrical heights . in particular , we find that an adsorbed multilayer corresponds to a vacuum layer with an height being about half the geometrical height of the multilayer . the increasing difference in geometrical height and apparent heights with the number of layers makes it increasingly difficult to image the layer . the larger @xmath56 than @xmath4 for @xmath57 is consistent with the behavior of the calculated partial @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 dos around the cl atoms , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdos ] .",
    "the interface layer has the largest conductivity because of the formation of a weak covalent bond between a cl atom in the interface layer and the cu substrate results in a non - vanishing density of states in the gap region in the interface layer .",
    "whereas for the other layers , this contribution to the density of states are vanishingly small resulting in a smaller conductance and smaller apparent heights than for the interface layer .",
    "note that the variation of the the work functions with the number of adsorbed layers contribute to @xmath4 but can not explain the variation in @xmath4 with @xmath55 .",
    "for instance , the decrease of the work function from the monolayer to the bilayer decreases the difference between @xmath56 and @xmath58 because wave functions for electrons at the fermi level decreases more slowly with decreasing work function .    finally , how the tunneling through a nacl overlayer is affected by the presence of a band gap in bulk nacl is obtained from the measured @xmath0 spectrum .",
    "the characteristic features of this spectrum such as the strong reduction of @xmath0 for voltages in the range from -4.5 to 2 v is reproduced rather well by the simulated @xmath0 spectrum .",
    "this drastic reduction suggests a depletion of the ldos in the corresponding energy region , which can be attributed to the absence of propagating states in the overlayer in this energy region and the formation of a band gap . however , our discussion in section  [ sec : theory ] of the simulated @xmath0 spectrum in figs .",
    "[ fig : sts_th ] showed that this suggestion is oversimplified .",
    "the onset at around @xmath48 = 2 v is an ldos effect whereas the onset at @xmath48 = -4.5 v is caused by the voltage - dependent barrier and field - emission  @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we have carried out a combined scanning tunneling microscopy and density functional study of the surface topography , the apparent heights , work functions and the differential conductance of mono- , bi- , and tri - layers of nacl on a stepped cu(311 ) surface .",
    "the experimental results are well reproduced by the calculations , which also provide physical insights and interpretation of the results .",
    "the adsorption - induced changes of electronic and geometric structure of the nacl overlayer are found to be significant .",
    "the observed large adsorption - induced changes in the work function are found to be associated with substantial charge rearrangements upon adsorption .",
    "the cl atoms were shown to be imaged as protrusions . in the stm images , also the different positions of the cl atoms relative to the underlying cu(311 ) lattice in the p(3x2)-i and p(3x2)-ii structures of the nacl monolayer",
    "were resolved .",
    "the poor conductivity of the layers were revealed by the apparent heights of steps being only half of the geometrical heights .",
    "furthermore , @xmath0 spectra revealed a large reduction of the tunneling conductance in a wide voltage region , resembling a band gap .",
    "however , the simulated spectrum showed that only the onset at positive sample voltages may be viewed as a conduction band edge , whereas the onset at negative voltages is caused by the drastic effect of the electric field from the tip on the tunneling barrier .",

    "allocations of computer resources through the swedish national allocations committee ( snac ) and the consortium of heavy computing ( ktb ) at chalmers are also gratefully acknowledged .",
    "the slab contained six layers of cu atoms .",
    "we used the same slab for the mono- and bi - layers , where a vacuum region corresponding to 17   for the bare cu slab was used . for the trilayer ,",
    "the vacuum region corresponded to 25   for the bare cu slab .",
    "the surface unit cell contained three cu atoms in each substrate layer and two na and cl atoms in each nacl layer .",
    "the surface brillouin zone ( sbz ) was sampled using 36 @xmath59-points and the plane - wave cut - off energy was 300 ev ."
