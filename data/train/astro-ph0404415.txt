    "the kinematical ( `` jeans '' ) analyses of near - spherical structures using the spherical jeans equation for stationary systems : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the 3d density distribution of the tracer population , suffer from the fact that this one equation involves two unknowns : the mass distribution @xmath4 and the velocity anisotropy @xmath5 ( we make use of the symmetry of spherical systems yielding @xmath6 ) . in some cases of simple anisotropy profiles",
    "@xmath7 , the jeans equation can be inverted to yield the radial dispersion as a single integral over radii of @xmath8 times some kernel , and one can insert this solution into the equation that links the line - of - sight velocity dispersion to the radial one , to obtain after some algebra , the line - of - sight dispersion as a single integral over @xmath8 and some other kernel .    in what follows , we attempt to lift the mass / anisotropy degeneracy by adding a second equation , namely the 4th order jeans equation for constant anisotropy ( okas 2002 ) @xmath9 where we express the line of sight _ kurtosis _ as a double integral over @xmath8 and @xmath10 and a third kernel ( the details are given in okas & mamon 2003 ) .",
    "we apply our formalism to the nearby coma cluster , for which we ve extracted from ned the positions and line - of - sight velocities of 967 galaxies , among which 355 early - type galaxies whose kinematics we analyze here ( we omit spiral galaxies , which are expected to have a non negligible mean radial velocity caused by their infall and subsequent transformation at cluster pericenter ) . our mass model includes 1 ) a stellar component , which we find is well fit by an nfw ( navarro et al .",
    "1996 ) model ; 2 ) a dark matter component , which we assume to be a generalized nfw model with arbitrary inner slope : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the scale radius of the dark matter ( in general different from that of the luminous distribution ) , and @xmath13 for the nfw model .",
    "the profiles differ by their inner slope @xmath14 but have a common outer limiting behavior of @xmath15 ; and 3 ) an isothermal gas component , taken from the rosat x - ray observations by briel et al .",
    "( 1992 ) .    using 7 radial bins at @xmath16 , we jointly fit our four parameters , mass @xmath17 within the virial radius @xmath18 , velocity anisotropy @xmath19 , inner slope @xmath20 of the dark matter density profile , and dark matter concentration @xmath21 . contrary to the case",
    "when only velocity dispersion is studied , the minimization procedure now converges ( except for a concentration / inner slope degeneracy ) .",
    "the best fits are shown in figure  [ allplots ] .",
    "the best fit parameters are @xmath22 ( corresponding to dark matter virial radius @xmath23 mpc ) , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 with @xmath27 .",
    "in other words , our best fit models are isotropic and the generalized dark matter model of equation  ( [ rhoofr ] ) provides excellent fits to the data .",
    "our best fit radial profiles for each half - integer value of @xmath20 are shown in figure  [ profs ] .",
    "the best fit density profiles are indistinguishable beyond @xmath28 , and the outer mass profiles are very close to the infall estimates of geller , diaferio & kurtz ( 1999 ) .",
    "the density profiles are 50% more concentrated than in structures of comparable mass within cosmological @xmath0-body simulations in a @xmath29cdm universe ( bullock et al .",
    "interestingly , the @xmath30 profiles have nearly constant slope for the nfw case ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "our analysis differs from previous kinematical analyses ( e.g. merritt 1987 ; den hartog & katgert 1996 ; carlberg et al . 1997 ; van der marel et al . 2000 ; biviano & girardi 2003 ; katgert et al .",
    "2004 ) , as 1 ) we have , for a single cluster , a larger sample of galaxies , which , given their early morphological type , should be in dynamical equilibrium in the cluster potential ; 2 ) we remove pairs from the computation of the velocity moments ; 3 ) we include kurtosis in the analysis ; 4 ) we model the dark matter distribution using a generalized formula inspired by the results of cosmological @xmath0-body simulations ; 5 ) we include hot gas . in comparison to studies based upon stacking of many clusters , our analysis of the coma cluster benefits from not having to introduce errors in any stacking procedure , and from a cleaner removal of interlopers .",
    "on the other hand , the analyses of stacked clusters have the advantage of averaging out particular inhomogeneities of individual clusters such as coma , expected in hierarchical scenarios of structure formation and observed in coma , both in projected space ( fitchett & webster 1987 ; mellier et al . 1988 ; briel et al . 1992 ) and velocity space ( colless & dunn 1996 ; biviano et al .",
    "in our jeans analysis of the coma cluster , we assumed that the cluster was spherical , with no substructure nor streaming motions , and that projection effects were not serious .",
    "we test ( details in sanchis , okas & mamon 2004 ) these assumptions using an @xmath29cdm cosmological @xmath0-body ( tree - code ) simulation , run by ninin ( 1999 ) , with @xmath31 particles , and with @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 ( details in hatton et al .",
    "we analyze each of the 10 most massive halos along 3 axes : the major axis , an orthogonal one and an intermediate one .",
    "figure  [ mom0 ] shows the radial profiles of line - of - sight velocity moments ( mean , dispersion , skewness and kurtosis ) along the principal axis .",
    "these profiles display statistically significant radial variations caused by substructures with radial streaming motions .",
    "moreover , the moments vary considerably from halo to halo and for the 3 different projections of a given halo . note also that the projected mean velocity differs substantially between all the particles in the projected cylinder and the subset within the virial sphere .",
    "figure  [ fits ] shows the results of our fits from our jeans analysis ( _ open symbols _ ) in comparison with our fits to the 3d data ( _ crosses _ ) and table  [ stats ] summarizes the statistical accuracy of our fitting procedure .       the virial mass is typically underestimated by @xmath36 , while the concentration parameter is overestimated by @xmath37 and the ratio @xmath38 underestimated by @xmath39 .",
    "hence , our kinematical analysis yields good results _ on average _ , but with a fairly large dispersion in accuracies ( with the most inaccurate estimates for halos with non zero mean line of sight velocities at some radii ) .",
    "halo 4 , which departs the most from the 3d measures of concentration and anisotropy , happens to have important variations in its projected mean velocity profile , whereas nearly all other halos have normal mean velocity profiles .",
    "this suggests that the joint dispersion / kurtosis jeans analysis is adequate for structures with fairly constant projected mean velocity profiles . given the large dispersion on the concentration parameter , our high value of @xmath40 for coma is now consistent with the 1.5 times lower value expected from cosmological @xmath0-body simulations"
