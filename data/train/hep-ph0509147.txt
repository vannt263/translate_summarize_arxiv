    "recently hypercp collaboration has reported  @xcite the first evidence for the decay @xmath0 with branching ratio at the level of @xmath15 .",
    "the central value of the measured branching ratio is larger than most standard model ( sm ) estimates , although discrepancy with sm _ in the overall branching ratio _ may not be dramatic in view of large uncertainties in the hadronic matrix elements  @xcite .",
    "the most remarkable property of the hypercp events is that dimuon masses of all three of them are equal within the resolution of the detector .",
    "this suggests  @xcite that the observed @xmath16 pairs are decay products of a new neutral particle @xmath17 born in the hyperon decay @xmath18 with branching ratio @xmath19\\times 10^{-8}\\;,\\ ] ] and mass of the intermediate neutral state @xmath17 equal to @xmath20 as a phenomenologically viable explanation , supersymmetric models with light sgoldstino and parity conservation  @xcite have been proposed  @xcite , the state @xmath17 being interpreted as spinless particle @xmath2 ( sgoldstino )  one of the superpartners of goldstino .",
    "this interpretation is further discussed in this paper .",
    "our purpose is to estimate the relevant range of model parameters and to discuss other experiments sensitive to such models .    from hypercp results",
    "we will estimate the strength of sgoldstino coupling to muons , responsible for the sgoldstino decay @xmath21 , and sgoldstino flavor violating coupling to @xmath22- and @xmath23-quarks , responsible for the hyperon decay  .",
    "in particular , we will find that the sgoldstino explanation of hypercp events implies the scale of supersymmetry breaking @xmath24 within the range 2.5 - 60  tev ( depending on hierarchy between mssm soft terms @xmath25 and @xmath24 ) .",
    "the estimate of the flavor violating coupling suggests that sgoldstino would show up in kaon physics .",
    "the observed events can not be attributed to _ scalar _",
    "sgoldstino , since in that case sgoldstino had to be already detected in two - body kaon decays .",
    "it is the _ pseudoscalar _ sgoldstino @xmath2 that can play a role of x - particle .",
    "pseudoscalar sgoldstino @xmath2 , responsible for the hypercp events , can be observed in the decays @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 at the branching ratios of at least of order @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively . with the inferred value of @xmath24",
    ", the model can be probed also at @xmath12 colliders in the channel @xmath13 and @xmath14 , where the cross section is estimated as 1  pb - 5  ab depending on hierarchy of mssm soft terms and the value of @xmath24 .",
    "finally , sgoldstino may be searched for via its resonant production in @xmath12 collision at @xmath26  mev .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sec : models ] supersymmetric models with light sgoldstino are briefly discussed and useful notations are introduced .",
    "the range of parameters , relevant for the explanation of hypercp events , is estimated in sec.[sec : parameters ] . in sec.[sec : tests ] we study prospects of various experiments in testing sgoldstino couplings .",
    "sec.[sec : conclusion ] contains concluding remarks .",
    "superpartners of goldstino  longitudinal component of gravitino  may be fairly light . in a variety of models with low energy supersymmetry they are lighter than a few gev .",
    "such pattern emerges in a number of non - minimal supergravity models  @xcite and also in gauge mediation models if supersymmetry is broken via non - trivial superpotential ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . here",
    "we merely assume that sgoldstino masses are small , so that @xmath27-hyperon decay into proton and sgoldstino is kinematically allowed .",
    "sgoldstinos couple to mssm fields in the same way as goldstino  @xcite , with corresponding coupling constants being proportional to the ratios of mssm soft terms ( squark and gaugino masses , trilinear coupling constants ) to the supersymmetry breaking parameter @xmath28 ( which is of the order of squared scale of supersymmetry breaking in the underlying theory ) .",
    "constraints on sgoldstino couplings may be translated into the limits on @xmath24 .",
    "the most sensitive probes of sgoldstinos are flavor violating processes  @xcite , provided that flavor is violated in squark and/or slepton sector .",
    "a sketch of the sgoldstino interactions , experimental constraints on the models with light sgoldstino and relevant references can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a special class of supersymmetric extensions of the standard model in which interactions of sgoldstinos with quarks and gluons conserve parity but do not conserve quark flavor , has been considered in ref .",
    "parity conservation in sgoldstino interactions with quarks and gluons ( as well as with leptons and photons ) may not be accidental .",
    "as an example , it is natural in theories with spontaneously broken left - right symmetry ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) , which not only are aesthetically appealing but also provide a solution  @xcite to the strong cp - problem .",
    "it was found  @xcite that if the pseudoscalar sgoldstino @xmath2 is light , @xmath29 , and the scalar sgoldstino is heavier , @xmath30 , an interesting place for experimental searches is the poorly explored area of three - body decays of kaons , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , with @xmath2 subsequently decaying into @xmath34 , possibly @xmath35 , @xmath36 , or flying away from the detector .",
    "possible sgoldstino contribution to hyperon physics has been considered in ref .",
    "it was shown that searches for hyperon decays into baryon and sgoldstino are very sensitive to sgoldstino couplings in models with light pseudoscalar sgoldstino , @xmath37 , heavy scalar sgoldstino , @xmath30 , and parity conservation . in what follows we will consider models with parity conservation in sgoldstino interactions , and make a remark on the parity - violating models in an appropriate place .",
    "we are interested in trilinear couplings between sgoldstino and sm fields , which can be derived by making use of spurion technique ( see e.g. , refs .",
    "the coupling constants of sgoldstino to @xmath38 gauge bosons are proportional to the ratio of gaugino soft mass terms to vacuum expectation value of the auxiliary component @xmath28 of the spurion superfield , while the coupling constants of sgoldstino to sm fermions @xmath39 are proportional to the product of fermion mass @xmath40 and the ratio of trilinear soft term @xmath41 to @xmath28 .",
    "in particular , relevant for our study _ flavor - blind _ sgoldstino interactions are determined by the following effective lagrangians  @xcite : for pseudoscalar sgoldstino @xmath2 @xmath42 and for scalar sgoldstino @xmath43 @xmath44 where @xmath45 with @xmath46 being gaugino masses .",
    "it is worth noting that in many models of supersymmetry breaking one has @xmath47 , while the opposite case , @xmath48 , corresponds to unitarity limit .    of special interest here",
    "are also the couplings of sgoldstinos to @xmath22- and @xmath23-quarks , which _",
    "violate flavor_. in models with parity conservation it is convenient to parameterize the corresponding interaction terms as  @xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 , @xmath52 are left - right soft terms in the matrix of squared masses of squarks .",
    "these interaction terms are assumed to be responsible for the hyperon decay  .",
    "couplings   and give rise to the hyperon decays  @xcite @xmath53 and @xmath54 respectively , whose rates can be estimated by making use of the matrix elements @xmath55 and neglecting the external momentum dependence of the form factors @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the isospin symmetry implies that these constants are the same as ones describing @xmath58 decay , hence  @xcite , @xmath59 then @xmath60 where @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 are masses of @xmath23-quark , @xmath64-hyperon and proton , respectively .",
    "these amplitudes yield the hyperon decay rates  @xcite @xmath65 where @xmath66    let us turn to the results of hypercp collaboration  @xcite . considering the central values of eqs .",
    ", as a reference point , one obtains from eqs .  ,",
    "latexmath:[\\ ] ] these results are obtained to the leading order in chiral perturbation theory .",
    "one may expect that actual numbers may be 30% to 50% larger .",
    "indeed , experimental data on the process @xmath102 , which is quite similar to the decays we consider , are noticeable larger than the leading order predictions of chiral perturbation theory ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    for similar modes with",
    "sgoldstino decaying into photons one gets the same numbers multiplied by @xmath103 .",
    "therefore , the branching ratios of the decays @xmath104 may be substantially higher ( which is still a fairly natural possibility ) , branching ratios of @xmath104 are larger than given in     by a factor of order @xmath105 . ] .",
    "note that decays into final state with neutral pions have significantly higher rates , as compared to charged pions , because of larger phase space .",
    "note also that the above estimates for the branching ratios of the decays ( [ ka ] )    ( [ ke ] ) apply not only to sgoldstino , but to any pseudoscalar particle explaining the hypercp events .",
    "flavor - blind sgoldstino - photon and sgoldstino - muon couplings can be tested at @xmath12 colliders .",
    "sgoldstino coupling constants to leptons are dimensionless and proportional to lepton masses , hence the most promising processes of sgoldstino production involve sgoldstino - photon coupling .",

    "these formulae are valid for @xmath112 , when the two - photon decay mode is indeed dominant .    in the opposite case , with dominant decay into @xmath16 ,",
    "one obtains @xmath113 the latter formulae are relevant for @xmath114 , otherwise the assumption of dominant decay into @xmath16 would not be valid .",
    "the cross section of @xmath115 production , with the accuracy @xmath116 , is  @xcite @xmath117 it grows with energy , becoming comparable with @xmath118 production at @xmath119  gev and exceeding @xmath118 cross section by a factor of 16 at @xmath120  gev .",
    "another possibility of searching for light sgoldstino in @xmath12-annihilation is sgoldstino resonant production with the beams energy tuned to sgoldstino mass . in this case",
    "the cross section of sgoldstino production exactly at the resonance peak is @xmath121 if sgoldstino width is saturated by the decay into @xmath16 , then at the peak @xmath122 if the @xmath123 mode dominates over @xmath16 , then @xmath124 to estimate the number of events in realistic case one multiplies the above values by the product of collider luminosity and the ratio of the sgoldstino width to the beam energy spread .",
    "the latter is typically of order @xmath125 with @xmath126 .",
    "thus , the suppression factor is @xmath127 for sgoldstino lifetimes saturating the bounds and , respectively .",
    "hence , in the case @xmath128 , meaningful search for resonant production of sgoldstino starts at integrated luminosity of 100  nb@xmath129 , while integrated luminosity of up to 100  fb@xmath129 is required to fully explore the parameter space .",
    "sgoldstino with energy @xmath130 in laboratory frame flies , before its decay , a distance of about @xmath131 thus , there is an opportunity to resolve sgoldstino vertices .",
    "let us now discuss briefly exotic models with hierarchy @xmath132 , where sgoldstino - electron coupling gets enhanced as compared to models with the case @xmath133 .",
    "first , @xmath12 decay mode of sgoldstino never becomes dominant : for sgoldstino with mass @xmath134  mev the bound on its lifetime gives unacceptably low scales of supersymmetry breaking , @xmath135  gev even in unitarity limit @xmath136 .",
    "second , upper limit on br(@xmath137 ) is achieved for @xmath138 approaching unitarity limit @xmath136 .",
    "then , in models where sgoldstino decays dominantly into photon pairs , the upper bounds on br(@xmath137 ) are within @xmath139 for @xmath140  tev . in models with sgoldstino decaying mostly into @xmath16-pair , the upper bounds on br(@xmath137 )",
    "are between 0.7% and @xmath141 for @xmath140  tev .",
    "thus , search for sgoldstino in the decay channel @xmath137 is not promising even for @xmath142 .",
    "however , the cross section of the resonance production is considerably enhanced for @xmath142 as compared to the conservative case @xmath143 , so in this case sgoldstino would show up at relatively low integrated luminosity ( of order 1  nb@xmath129 ) .",
    "to conclude , we have identified the relevant region of parameter space of models with light sgoldstino , which can be responsible for anomalous events reported by hypercp collaboration .",
    "we have estimated sgoldstino couplings and have predicted rates of rare three - body kaon decays and sgoldstino production in @xmath12 collisions .",
    "sgoldstino may be searched for in @xmath16 and @xmath123 decay channels , while @xmath12 channel never dominates .",
    "experimental tests of our predictions will confirm or rule out sgoldstino explanation of hypercp results .",
    "the special features of the supersymmetric models , capable of explaining hypercp results as evidence for sgoldstino , are : ( _ i _ ) low energy scale of supersymmetry breaking in the underlying theory ( @xmath144  tev ) , ( _ ii _ ) parity conservation ( left - right entries in squark squared mass matrices make a hermitian matrix , @xmath145 ) , ( _ iii _ ) tiny flavor violation associated with @xmath146 entry of squark squared mass matrix ( @xmath147 for @xmath148  tev and sgoldstino decaying mostly into @xmath16 ; these bounds scale as @xmath149 and become larger by an order of magnitude with smaller but still natural @xmath150 ) .",
