    "in the late eighties , w.  kirsch @xcite investigated the relative eigenvalue counting function @xmath6 for compactly - supported nonnegative perturbations @xmath3 of the nonnegative laplacian @xmath7 on cubes @xmath8 -l / 2 , l /2 [ ^d \\subset { \\mathbb{r}}^d$ ] with dirichlet boundary conditions .",

    "perhaps surprisingly , kirsch proved @xcite that if @xmath21 and if @xmath22 , then @xmath23 furthermore , he proved the existence of a countable dense set of energies @xmath24 so that @xmath25 clearly , the reason for this divergence is the growing degeneracy of eigenvalues of the laplacian in @xmath26 dimensions as @xmath27 , which is lifted by the perturbation @xmath3 .",
    "in contrast , in @xmath28 space dimension , and also for corresponding lattice systems in arbitrary dimension , the spectral shift function remains bounded in this limit , as follows from a finite - rank - perturbation argument .",
    "more generally , if one replaces the sequence @xmath29 in by another diverging sequence of lengths , one would expect the set of `` bad '' energies @xmath30 to change .",
    "one might conjecture , however , that the largest set of energies @xmath30 , on which @xmath31 explodes , still has zero lebesgue measure .",
    "although still unproven in this generality , this conjecture is strongly supported by theorems  [ himu-1 ] and  [ himu-2 ] below .    in order to state these theorems , we need to list the hypotheses .",
    "we write @xmath32 and @xmath33 to denote the kato class and the local kato class , respectively @xcite .",
    "we say @xmath34 is kato decomposable , @xmath35 , if @xmath36 and @xmath37 . in the following we consider two real - valued potential functions @xmath34 and @xmath3 on @xmath12 such that @xmath38 we also introduce the corresponding infinite - volume self - adjoint schrdinger operators @xmath39 and @xmath40 on @xmath41 .",

    "here we have set @xmath70 for all @xmath71 .",
    "the simple proof @xcite of theorem  [ himu-2 ] relies on theorem  [ himu-1 ] , the fact that @xmath3 , and hence @xmath31 , has a definite sign , and a deep result of komls . for one - dimensional systems , equality in ( [ ces - in ] ) has recently been shown in @xcite .",
    "we refer to the literature cited in @xcite for further estimates of spectral shift functions .",
    "in this note we are interested in refining the convergence in theorem  [ himu-1 ] for the case where the background potential @xmath34 is periodic with period @xmath72 .",
    "in this situation , one can consider the potential @xmath3 centered at any point @xmath73 , with @xmath74 and @xmath75 , so that @xmath76 .",
    "one expects that the limit in is independent of the shift @xmath77 .",
