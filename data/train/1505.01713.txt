    "machine - type communication ( mtc ) is commonly characterized by a large number of cellular devices that are active sporadically , where a large number of devices may activate in a correlated way due to a sensed physical phenomenon ( e.g. , a power outage in the smart grid ) . in more traditional human - centric traffic where the associated payloads are relatively large",
    ", a small number of active devices can cause the network to become in outage mainly due to the lack of available resources for data transmission .",
    "in contrast , the associated payloads are relatively small in mtc such that the division of the aggregate available data rate with the small data rate required by each machine - type device ( mtd ) leads to the conclusion that the system can support a vast number of mtds .",
    "recent studies have shown that such a conclusion is misleading : the network still becomes in outage , not being able to provide access to the mtds , despite plenty of available resources to support a massive number of mtds . here",
    "the culprit in the limited number of supported devices , is not the available resources as in human - centric traffic , but instead the bottlenecks in the access reservation protocol  @xcite . specifically in lte ,",
    "the access reservation protocol that is outlined in fig .",
    "[ fig : lte_msg1-msg4 ] has two limitations that unveil with mtc .",
    "the first is in _ msg 1 _ , where only a limited number of preambles can be used to signal a sporadic request for uplink resources to the enodeb , in the rach phase .",
    "the second is in _ msg 2 _ , where a bottleneck may be caused by the limited amount of feedback resources in the access granting ( ag ) phase .    in the literature , analytical models of the preamble collision probability",
    "have already been considered in standardization documents @xcite and scientific papers @xcite . in @xcite the preamble collision probability is used to estimate the success probability of transmission attempts .",
    "however , we have found that existing models are incomplete and inaccurate and in this paper we introduce a superior model that closely matches the system outage breaking point of the detailed simulation .",
    "the second limitation in the ag phase has been considered separate from collisions in @xcite for bursty arrivals following the beta distribution , which is a valuable result for situations where many alarm messages are sent simultaneously . in @xcite",
    "the authors present an approach to cell planning and adaptation of prach resources that only takes into account the preamble collisions . as we show in this paper ,",
    "the ag phase is a limiting factor before the amount of preamble collisions becomes an issue , since the impact of occasional collisions is effectively diminished with retransmissions . in @xcite",
    "the authors present an analysis accounting for preamble collision and the ag phase , which however does not consider retransmissions .",
    "in this paper we propose an analytical model of the transmission failure probability in an lte cell for sporadic uplink transmissions carried over the lte random access channel .",
    "the proposed model captures the features of the existing access reservation protocol in lte , meaning that we are not proposing a new access protocol rather introducing a tool for analysis of the existing lte access reservation protocol .",
    "the purpose of the proposed model is to be able to estimate the capacity in terms of the number of terminals or rach arrival density that can be supported by lte in a given configuration while accounting for retransmissions as well as modeling the bottlenecks that appear in the contention phase and the ag phase .",
    "this is a major contribution of the paper , as the existing models do not capture these bottlenecks .",
    "three other contributions are : 1 ) an iterative procedure to determine the impact of retransmissions using a markov chain model of the retransmission and backoff procedure ; 2 ) analytical derivations of the metrics based on a markov chain , thereby achieving an analytical model that can be evaluated at click - speed .",
    "3 ) analysis of the protocol breaking point using ever increasing access loads to the network .",
    "initially we present the system model and assumptions in section  [ sec : system_model ] , whereafter in section  [ sec : arp_model ] we present the proposed analytical model of the access reservation bottlenecks in lte .",
    "the proposed model is compared numerically to simulation results and other models from the literature in section  [ sec : results ] , and finally the conclusions are given in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we focus our analysis on a single lte cell , with @xmath0 mtds , also called machine - type user equipment ( ue ) .",
    "we assume that the mtc applications associated with these mtds , generate new uplink transmissions with an aggregate rate @xmath1 , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : lte_diagram ] .",
    "that is , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the transmission generation rate of the @xmath4th out of @xmath5 mtc applications running on the ues .",
    "we assume this aggregate rate follows a poisson distribution with rate @xmath1",
    ". for each new data transmission , up to @xmath6 retransmissions are allowed , resulting in a maximum of @xmath7 allowed transmissions .",
    "when these transmissions fail and retransmissions occur , then an additional stress is put on the access reservation protocol , since the rate of retransmissions @xmath8 adds to the total rate @xmath9 . as shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : lte_diagram ] , we split the access reservation model into two parts : ( i ) the one - shot transmission part in fig .",
    "[ fig : lte_diagram](a ) that models the bottlenecks at each stage of the access reservation protocol ; ( ii ) the @xmath6-retransmission part in fig .",
    "[ fig : lte_diagram](b ) , where a finite number of retransmissions and backoffs are modeled .",
    "we focus our analysis on mtc , for which the traffic is characterized by having a very small payload .",
    "therefore , in the one - shot transmission , depicted in fig .  [",
    "fig : lte_diagram](a ) , we assume that the rach and access granting phases are the system bottlenecks . in other words ,",
    "we assume that the network has enough data resources to deliver the serviced mtc traffic .",
    "the uplink resources in lte for frequency division duplexing ( fdd ) are divided into time and frequency units denoted resource blocks ( rbs )  @xcite . the time is divided in frames , where every frame has ten subframes , each subframe of duration @xmath10  ms .",
    "the system bandwidth determines the number of rbs per subframe that ranges between 6  rbs and 100  rbs .",
    "the number of subframes between two consecutive random access opportunities ( raos ) denoted @xmath11 varies between 1 and 20 .",
    "every rao occupies 6  rbs and up to 1 rao per subframe is allowed .",
    "the lte random access follows the access reservation principle meaning that devices must contend for uplink transmission resources in a slotted aloha fashion within a rao  @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lte_msg1-msg4 ] , the access procedure consists of the exchange of four different messages between a ue and the enodeb .",
    "the first message ( msg  1 ) is a randomly selected preamble sent in the first coming rao . in fig .  [",
    "fig : lte_diagram](a ) the intensity of ue requests leading to preamble activations is represented by @xmath9 .",
    "lte has 64 orthogonal preambles , where only @xmath12 are typically available for contention among devices , since the rest are reserved for timing alignment .",
    "commonly , the enodeb can only detect which preambles have been activated but not if multiple activations ( collisions ) have occured .",
    "this assumption holds in small cells  ( * ? ? ?",
    "17.5.2.3 ) , and refers to the worst - case scenario where the detected preamble does not reveal anything about how many users are simultaneously sending that preamble .",
    "in other words , the preamble collision is not detected at msg  1 .",
    "thereafter , in msg  2 , the enodeb returns a random access response ( rar ) to all detected preambles .",
    "the intensity of activated preambles is in fig .",
    "[ fig : lte_diagram](a ) represented by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 since in a preamble collision only 1 preamble is activated . the contending devices listen to the downlink channel , expecting msg  2 within @xmath15 .",
    "it should be noted that typically a maximum of 3 rar messages per subframe can be sent by the enodeb @xcite .",
    "if no msg  2 is received and the maximum of @xmath16 msg  1 transmissions has not been reached , the device backs off and restarts the random access procedure after a randomly selected backoff time within the interval @xmath17",
    "\\cap \\mathbb{z}^+$ ] , where @xmath18 is the maximum backoff time .",
    "if received , msg  2 includes uplink grant information , that indicates the rb in which the connection request ( msg  3 ) should be sent .",
    "the connection request specifies the requested service type , e.g. , voice call , data transmission , measurement report , etc . in case of collision",
    "the devices receive the same msg  2 , resulting in their msg  3s colliding in the rb .",
    "in contrast to the collisions of msg  1 , the enodeb is able to detect collisions of msg  3 .",
    "the enodeb only replies to the msg  3s that did not experience collision , by sending message msg  4 , with which the required rbs are allocated or the request is denied in case of insufficient resources .",
    "the latter is however unlikely in the case of mtc , due to the small payloads .",
    "if the msg  4 is not received within @xmath19 since msg  1 was sent , the random access procedure is restarted .",
    "finally , if a device does not successfully finish all the steps of the random access procedure within @xmath7 msg  1 transmissions , an outage is declared .",
    "we now go to the analysis of the access reservation procedure .",
    "first , we model the _ one - shot transmission _ and then extend it to the _ @xmath6-retransmissions _ model .",
    "the numerical results cover the complete model , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : lte_diagram ] .",
    "we are interested in characterizing how often a transmission from a ue fails .",
    "this happens when the transmission is not successful in both the preamble contention and ag phases , i.e. , a request from the ue must not experience a preamble collision and the uplink grant must not become stale and dropped . we model this as two independent events : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the collision probability in the preamble contention phase given ue request rate @xmath9 , while @xmath22 is the probability of the uplink grant being dropped from the ag queue given preamble activation rate @xmath13 .",
    "we start by computing @xmath21 .",
    "let @xmath23 denote the number of available preambles ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "let the probability of not selecting the same preamble as one other ue be @xmath24 .",
    "then the probability of a ue selecting a preamble that has been selected by at least one other ue , given @xmath25 contending ues , is : @xmath26 assuming poisson arrivals with rate @xmath9 , then : @xmath27 \\\\",
    "\\nonumber                    & \\leq   1 - \\left ( 1 - \\frac{1}{d}\\right)^{\\lambda_\\text{t } \\cdot \\delta_\\text{rao}-1},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the probability mass function of the poisson distribution with arrival rate @xmath29 .",
    "the inequality comes from applying jensen s inequality to the concave function @xmath30 , where @xmath9 is the total arrival rate ( including retransmissions ) , and @xmath11 is the average number of subframes between raos . if 10 raos per frame and @xmath31 if 2 raos per frame . ]",
    "the computed @xmath21 is thus an upper bound on the collision probability .",
    "the mean number of activated preambles in the contention phase per rao , is given by @xmath13 .",
    "as discussed in section  [ sec : system_model ] , we assume that the enodeb is unable to discern between preambles that have been activated by a single user and multiple users , respectively",
    ". this will lead to a higher @xmath13 , than in the case where the enodeb is able to detect the preamble collisions .",
    "the main impact of this assumption is that there will be an increased rate of ag requests , even though part of these correspond to collided preambles , which even if accepted will lead to retransmissions .",
    "the @xmath13 can be well approximated , while assuming that the selection of each preamble by the contending users is independent , by , @xmath32 \\cdot d,\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the probability of k successes , which can be well approximated with a poisson distribution with arrival rate @xmath34 , i.e. : @xmath35 to compute the outage probability due to the limitation in the ag phase , i.e. , due to the maximum number of uplink grants per subframe and a maximum waiting time of @xmath36 subframes , we consider that this subsystem can be modeled as a queuing system .",
    "we assume that the loss probability @xmath22 can be seen as the _ long - run fraction of costumers that are lost _ in a queuing system with impatient costumers @xcite .    in lte",
    ", pending uplink grants are served with a deterministic time interval ( 1 subframe ) between each serving slot @xcite .",
    "a straightforward approach would be to use an m / d/1 model structure , as presented in @xcite , in order to compute the drop probability .",
    "unfortunately , the expression to compute @xmath22 for the m / d/1 queue does not have a closed - form solution .",
    "however the equivalent expression for the m / m/1 queue in @xcite has a closed - form solution , see eq . .",
    "we have compared the results of the two model types and found no noticeable difference in the computed outage numbers in practice .",
    "thus , in the following we use the m / m/1 model to compute @xmath22 : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the queue load , @xmath39 is the number of uplink grants per rar ( @xmath40 ) , with @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the max waiting time ( in terms of requests ) in the uplink grant queue , i.e. , @xmath43 .",
    "the fact that we are using an m / m/1 model instead of an m / d/1 model , may cause a discrepancy between the simulation and model results when the queue becomes congested ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "however , we are interested in the switching point ( @xmath45 ) from which we then estimate accurately the outage breaking point , as shown in the results in section [ sec : results ] .      when ues are allowed to make retransmissions the probability of an ue becoming in outage is the probability that none of the allowed @xmath7 transmissions attempts are successful . when retransmissions are allowed ( @xmath46 ) , the total arrival rate @xmath9 must include the extra arrivals caused by the ues retransmissions",
    "the number of retransmissions @xmath8 is however a result of the limit @xmath6 and transmission error probability @xmath47 , which in turn depends on the number of retransmissions @xmath8 .",
    "this chicken and egg problem can be solved iteratively using a derivative of the bianchi model @xcite applied to our system model . specifically , we are using a model adapted to lte , with a structure similar to the one presented in @xcite .",
    "the following derivations of the number of transmissions and outage probabilities have , to the best of our knowledge , not been presented previously .",

    "let @xmath63 be the steady state probability that a ue is at state @xmath64 .",
