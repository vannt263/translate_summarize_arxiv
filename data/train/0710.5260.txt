    "the steady state established for precessing spins is finite in the clean limit .",
    "an argument similar to that given above for the distribution of conserved spin @xmath118 shows that @xmath150 can not lead to a nonequilibrium spin density ( although , as will be shown below , higher - order terms in @xmath120 can contribute to the spin density ) .",
    "for , taking the expectation value of the spin operator , one arrives at integrals of the form @xmath156 , which involve odd numbers of powers of @xmath2 and are therefore zero .",
    "this term in the distribution of precessing spin does , however , give rise to nonzero spin currents , since integrals if the form @xmath157 contain an even numbers of powers of @xmath2 and may be nonzero .",

    "let us analyze the two terms in @xmath119 . by identifying terms in @xmath119 even and odd in @xmath29 ,",
    "as was done above , it is evident that the first term on the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sperp ] ) leads to a spin current , but no spin density .",
    "the second term does not lead to a spin current , but it does produce a spin density .",
    "nevertheless , this term tends to zero in the ballistic regime as well as in the strong momentum scattering regime , and it is not expected to be dominant .    the closed - form solution found in this section shows that , in the absence of spin - orbit interactions in the impurity potential , there is only _",
    "one _ spin current , which in the weak momentum - scattering limit is independent of @xmath4 and in the strong momentum - scattering limit is @xmath173 .",
    "bearing in mind that if @xmath149 vanishes all corrections of higher order also vanish , we conclude that , in the absence of spin - orbit interactions in the impurity potential , the distinction between intrinsic ( disorder - independent ) and extrinsic ( disorder - dependent ) spin currents is not useful .      our work helps to understand the origins of nonequilibrium spin densities and spin currents in electric fields .",
    "the preceding sections illustrate the fact that nonequilibrium spin densities have two origins .",
    "the first , giving the dominant contribution , arises from the absence of precession .",
    "as charge carriers are accelerated , a fraction of their spin is conserved and produces a steady - state spin density , @xcite a process which has no analog in charge transport .",
    "thus the dominant contribution to the nonequilibrium spin density in an electric field exists because in the course of spin precession a component of each individual spin is preserved . for an electron with wave vector @xmath174 , this spin component is parallel to @xmath175 . in equilibrium",
    "the average of these conserved components is zero .",
    "however , when an electric field is applied , the fermi surface is shifted , and the average of the conserved spin components may be nonzero , as illustrated in fig .  1 . this intuitive physical argument , to our knowledge absent to date from the literature , explains why the nonequilibrium spin density @xmath176 and _ requires _ scattering to balance the drift of the fermi surface .",
    "it is interesting to note , also , that , although spin densities in electric fields require the presence of band structure spin - orbit interactions and therefore spin precession , the dominant contribution arises as a result of the absence of spin precession .",
    "an additional contribution , which vanishes in both the ballistic and the weak momentum scattering regimes , is associated with spin precession .",
    "this contribution arises from the term on the last line of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sperp ] ) .",
    "the origin of this term can be understood by noting that , in the presence of an electric field , the effective magnetic field about which a spin precesses changes slowly .",
    "@xcite ( this is true in between scattering events . )",
    "this change is contained in the gauge - invariant crystal wave vector @xmath81 .",
    "the fact that the effective magnetic field is changing slowly causes the spin to acquire a small component in the direction in which the effective magnetic field is changing .",
    "this component is proportional to the rate of change of the effective magnetic field and therefore , in our case , to @xmath80 .",
    "it is associated with the ` flow ' of @xmath106 around the fermi surface discussed by shytov _",
    "et al_. @xcite this argument explains why this term in the spin density vanishes in the clean limit as well as in the strong momentum scattering limit .",
    "for , in the absence of scattering , as @xmath2 changes , the effective magnetic field will circle around the fermi surface , and the component of the spin following it will average to zero . in the strong momentum scattering limit , on the other hand , the spin will not have time to acquire a component in the direction in which the effective magnetic field is changing , due to the high frequency of scattering events .",
    "effective field @xmath54 at the fermi energy in the rashba model @xcite ( a ) without @xcite ( @xmath177 ) and ( b ) with an external electric field ( @xmath178 ) . ]",
    "furthermore , in the absence of spin - orbit interactions in the impurity potentials , spin currents are associated with displacement of spins .",
    "the relation between spin currents and spin precession was made explicit in the work of sinova _",
    "et  al . _",
    "@xcite    we remark that both @xmath118 and @xmath120 are invariant under time - reversal . as a result ,",
    "the tensor characterizing the response of spin currents to electric fields is invariant under time reversal , whereas the tensor characterizing the response of spin densities to electric fields changes sign under time reversal , as expected in both cases .",
    "@xcite      it is enlightening to compare the results obtained in the absence of scattering ( i.e. , the clean limit ) with the results obtained when scattering is present .",
    "the aim is to obtain an understanding of the way scattering processes affect steady - state spin distributions in electric fields .",
    "this is done by comparing results obtained using the approach outlined in this paper with results obtained previously using green s functions approaches , both for the case when scattering is not included and for the case in which scattering is taken into account .",
    "this process will aid us in identifying the information contained in vertex corrections to spin - related quantities in the framework of green s functions - based theories of systems with spin - orbit interactions .",
    "the nature of this information is by no means obvious , and we will show that it has no analog in charge transport .    in the absence of scattering , eq .",
    "( [ eq : sboltz ] ) takes the form @xmath179 = & \\displaystyle \\frac{e{\\bm e}}{\\hbar}\\cdot{\\frac{\\partial s_{0{\\bm k}}}{\\partial { \\bm k}}}. \\end{array}\\ ] ] comparison of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sboltz ] ) and ( [ eq : cleansboltz ] ) shows that the driving term in the equation for the nonequilibrium spin distribution @xmath105 is renormalized by the term @xmath180 , which accounts for spin - dependent scattering .",
    "in addition , eq .  ( [ eq : dsperp0dt ] ) shows that scattering mixes the distributions of conserved and precessing spins .",
    "this is so because when one spin at wave vector @xmath2 and precessing about @xmath54 is scattered to wave vector @xmath181 and precesses about @xmath182 , its conserved component changes , a process which alters the distributions of conserved and precessing spin .",
    "consequently , scattering processes in systems with spin - orbit interactions cause a renormalization of the driving term for the spin distribution , contained in @xmath111 , as well as scattering between the conserved and precessing spin distributions , described by @xmath183 .",
    "our analysis suggests that contributions due to these two processes are contained in vertex corrections to spin - dependent quantities found in green s functions formalisms .    in two dimensions , for hamiltonians linear in wave vector , we find that the renormalization term @xmath180 does not contribute to the spin current for any elastic scattering .",
    "therefore , the vertex correction to spin currents , found in other work , @xcite represents only scattering between conserved and precessing spin distributions . by noting that in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sperp ] ) the correction to the source term in the equation for the precessing spin distribution has the form @xmath184 and thus depends on the steady state spin _ density _ , it becomes evident that the existence of a nonzero nonequilibrium spin density does affect the spin current .",
    "furthermore , in three dimensions , for electrons in zincblende crystals , which are described by the @xmath185-dresselhaus model , we find that , for short range impurities , the spin current obtained after inclusion of scattering is the same as when scattering is not included .",
    "it is known that the vertex correction to spin currents also vanishes @xcite in these systems .",
    "noting that the steady - state spin density in zincblende crystals vanishes by symmetry , and more generally vanishes in any non - gyrotropic medium , @xcite these observations reinforce our conclusion relating to the connection between vertex corrections to spin currents and the presence of a steady - state spin density .",
    "we therefore expect vertex corrections to spin currents to vanish in non - gyrotropic materials , in which no steady - state spin density is possible in an electric field .",
    "@xcite      our calculations for known cases give results in agreement with previous work .",
    "firstly , our results agree with previous calculations of nonequilibrium spin densities .",
    "@xcite furthermore , in two dimensions , for hamiltonians linear in wave vector , the spin current vanishes for short - range impurities , @xcite as well as for small - angle scattering .",
    "@xcite ( we find that in fact it vanishes for any elastic scattering .",
    "@xcite ) for spin - orbit hamiltonians characterized solely by one angular fourier component @xmath186 ( ref . ) the spin current @xmath187 .    spin currents in systems in which band structure spin - orbit interactions are negligible were studied by engel   _ et  al . _ , @xcite who demonstrated that spin currents in those circumstances are due to skew scattering .",
    "skew scattering appears as a term of third order in the scattering potential @xmath26 ( which must include spin - orbit coupling explicitly ) , whereas in this work we have restricted our discussion to terms of second order in @xmath26 , and we have not considered higher - order skew - scattering effects .",
    "spin densities and spin currents excited by electric fields give rise to observable effects . in materials",
    "in which a nonequilibrium spin density is excited by an electric field , the presence of this spin density can be observed , for example , by means of magnetic circular dichroism @xcite , which has long been used as a characterization tool for magnetic materials .",
    "similarly , a spin current flowing transversely to the direction of the charge current ( i.e. , the spin - hall effect ) will give rise to a spin accumulation at the edge of the sample .",
    "a spin current flowing parallel to the direction of the charge current could be used as a means of spin injection from one semiconductor into another , as discussed in our recent work .",
    "@xcite spin accumulation as a result of a spin - hall current , or a spin density injected by means of a longitudinal spin current , can in turn be measured using magnetic circular dichroism @xcite techniques developed recently .",
    "we note that alternative techniques can be used to observe nonequilibrium spin densities , @xcite spin currents , @xcite and edge spin accumulations .",
    "we have demonstrated that , in the presence of band structure spin - orbit interactions , the steady state established for the carrier spin distribution contains two qualitatively distinct contributions , corresponding to conserved and precessing spin .",
    "the distribution of conserved spin acquires a nonequilibrium correction that diverges in the ballistic regime .",
    "this correction is responsible for the establishment of the dominant nonequilibrium spin densities in electric fields .",
    "the distribution of precessing spin acquires a nonequilibrium correction that is finite in the ballistic regime .",
    "this correction is responsible for the establishment of nonequilibrium spin currents in electric fields and a small nonequilibrium spin polarization , which vanishes in the ballistic and strong momentum scattering regimes .",
    "we have demonstrated that , when spin - orbit interactions are present in the band structure and absent from the impurity potential , there is only one contribution to the spin current , which appears independent of disorder in the ballistic regime but dependent on disorder in the strong momentum scattering regime .",
    "moreover , we have also shown that scattering processes in systems with spin - orbit interactions give rise to a renormalization of the driving term in the equation for the spin distribution , as well as scattering between the conserved and precessing spin distributions , which sheds light on the nature of vertex corrections in these systems .",
