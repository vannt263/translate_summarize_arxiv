    "the successive turnover times have no correlation .",
    "the first proposition implies that the density of turnover time is almost an exponential , since the term @xmath17 easily dominates the term @xmath18 for most values of @xmath19 ; see @xcite for a proof .",
    "the second proposition is a consequence of the markov property : each turnover time , which is a first passage time , is independently and identically distributed .",
    "the third property concerns the autocorrelation of the fluorescence intensity . as we have seen in figure  [ fig1 ]",
    ", the experimentally recorded fluorescence intensity consists of high spikes and low readings .",
    "the high peaks correspond to the release of the fluorescent product ( when the enzyme is at the state @xmath6 ) , whereas the low readings come from the background noise .",

    "\\(3 ) the experimental intensity autocorrelations decay neither exponentially nor faster under larger concentration .",

    "we believe these contradictions are rooted in the molecule s _ dynamic _ conformational fluctuation .",

    "theorem  [ theo1 ] , along with corollary  [ cor1 ] , provides an explanation of why the correlation of turnover times is not zero . at first sight",
    ", it seems to contradict the memoryless property of a markov chain .",
    "what actually happens is that the state must be explicitly specified for the memoryless property to hold ( i.e. , one needs to exactly specify whether an enzyme is at state @xmath112 or @xmath113 ) , whereas in the single - molecule experiment we only know whether the system is in an `` on '' or `` off '' state ( e.g. , one only knows that the enzyme is in one of the on - states @xmath114 ) .",
    "when there are multiple states , this aggregation effect leads to incomplete information that prevents the independence between successive turnovers ; consequently , each turnover time carries some information about its reaction path , which is correlated with the reaction path of the next turnover , resulting in the correlation between successive turnover times .",
    "corollary  [ cor1 ] also states that since @xmath103 , the autocorrelation is a mixture of exponential decays .",
    "thus , depending on the relative scales of the eigenvalues , the actual decay might be single - exponential when one eigenvalue dominates the others or multi - exponential when several major eigenvalues jointly contribute to the decay .      in most enzymatic reactions , including the one we study",

    "those enzymes are called fast - cycle - reset enzymes . to model this fact , we let @xmath40 @xmath115 , the transition rate from  @xmath29 to @xmath50 , go to infinity .",
    "then any enzyme in state @xmath29 will always return to state @xmath50 instantly , and the related transition probability matrix  @xmath86 , defined in  ( [ pmat ] ) , becomes the identity matrix .        in the single - enzyme experiments ,",
    "the raw data are the time traces of fluorescence intensity , as shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the time lag between two adjacent high fluorescence spikes gives the enzymatic turnover time .",
    "the fluorescence intensity reading , however , is subject to detection error : the error caused by the limited time resolution @xmath116 of the detector .",
    "starting from time 0 , the detector will only record intensity data at multiples of  @xmath116 : @xmath117 the intensity reading at time @xmath118 is actually the total number of photons received during the period of @xmath119 .",
    "thus , the detection errors of turnover time are roughly @xmath116 . when the successive reactions occur slowly , the average turnover time is much longer than @xmath116 , and the error is negligible .",
    "but when the reactions happen very frequently , the average turnover time becomes comparable to @xmath116 , and this error can not be ignored .",
    "in fact , when the substrate concentration is high enough , the enzyme will reach the `` on '' states so frequently that most of the intensity readings are very high , making it impossible to reliably determine the individual turnover times .",
    "under this situation , it is necessary to directly study the behavior of the raw intensity reading .",

    "we next address these questions before fitting the experimental data .      in the enzyme experiments , the transition rates are intrinsic properties of the enzyme and the enzyme  substrate complex ; they are not subject to experimental control .",

    "the experiments were repeated under different concentrations , resulting in different decay patterns of the autocorrelation functions as in figure  [ fig2 ] . a  successful theory should be able to explain the relationship between concentration and autocorrelation decay pattern .",

    "each scenario has its own biochemical implications .",
    "_ scenario _ 1 .",
    "there are no or negligible transitions among the @xmath50 states , that is , @xmath162 for @xmath32 .",
    "_ scenario _ 2 .",
    "there are no or negligible transitions among the @xmath163 states , that is , @xmath164 for @xmath32 .",
    "scenarios 1 and 2 correspond to the so - called slow fluctuating enzymes ( whose conformation fluctuates slowly over time ) .",
    "_ scenario _ 3 .",
    "the transitions among the @xmath50 states are much faster than the others , that is , @xmath165 and the scale @xmath166 is much larger than other transition rates .",
    "_ scenario _ 4 .",
    "the transitions among the @xmath51 states are much faster than the others , that is , @xmath167 and the scale @xmath166 is much larger than other transition rates .",
    "scenarios 3 and 4 correspond to the so - called fast fluctuating enzymes ( whose conformations fluctuate fast ) .    in the previous work [ @xcite ] , there are two other scenarios , which can also give rise to the hyperbolic relationship ( hyper ) : primitive enzymes , whose dissociate rate is much larger than their catalytic rate [ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] , and conformational - equilibrium enzymes , whose energy - barrier difference between dissociation and catalysis is invariant across conformations [ @xcite ] .",
    "but our analysis based on those two scenarios does not lead to any meaningful conclusion , so we omit them here .      based on the four scenarios , we have the following theorem for autocorrelation of turnover times .    [ theo4]for enzymes with fast cycle reset ,",

    "@xmath110 do not depend on @xmath5 $ ] , the substrate concentration .",

    "the nonone eigenvalues are of order @xmath171 , so the autocorrelation should decay extremely fast for all concentrations .",
    "this theorem tells us that for fast fluctuation enzymes ( scenarios 3 or 4 ) , the turnover time correlation tends to be zero .",
    "intuitively , this is because the fast fluctuation enzymes prefer conformation fluctuation rather than going through the binding - association - catalytic path that leads to the product , so in a single turnover event , the enzyme undergoes intensive conformation changes , which effectively blurs the information on the reaction path carried by the turnover time , resulting in zero correlation . under scenario 1 ,",
    "the autocorrelation decay pattern does not vary when the concentration changes .",
    "this is because when the enzyme does not fluctuate , it goes from @xmath50 to @xmath51 directly , and the change of concentration consequently does not alter the distribution of the reaction path .",
    "thus , the correlation between turnover times does not depend on the concentration .",
    "the result from scenarios 1 , 3 or 4 contradicts the experimental finding : correlation exists between the turnover time and is stronger under higher concentration ( see figure  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "only scenario 2 fully agrees with the experiments , suggesting that the enzyme  substrate complex ( @xmath51 ) does not fluctuate much .",

    "each of the four scenarios yields a different autocorrelation pattern , but only the one under scenario 2 matches the experimental finding .",
    "therefore , we will focus on scenario 2 from now on .      to simplify the coefficients @xmath111 and @xmath132 and to address the number of distinct conformations @xmath23",

    "first , we let @xmath188 and in this way model the transition rates as continuous variables with certain distributions . consequently",

    "second , we assume that all the coefficients ( @xmath111  and  @xmath132 ) are proportional to the probability weight of the conjugate eigenvalues . this assumption is partly based on the fact that all the observed experimental correlations are positive .",

    "@xmath192 and @xmath193 are functions of the transition rates .",
    "since the transition rates are always positive , a natural choice is to model the transition rates as either constants or following gamma distributions . in the previous work [ @xcite ] on the stochastic network model , the association rate @xmath7 and dissociation rate @xmath8",

    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows that our model gives a good fit to the turnover time autocorrelation and an adequate fit to the fluorescence intensity autocorrelation , capturing the main trend in the intensity autocorrelation .",
    "the distributions of the eigenvalues in the right panels clearly indicate that higher substrate concentration corresponds to larger eigenvalues , which are then responsible for the slower decay of the autocorrelations .",

    "in addition to providing a theoretical underpinning of the experimental observations , the numerical result from the model fits well with the experimental autocorrelation as seen in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "some problems remain open for future investigation :    \\(1 ) when we discussed the dependence of intensity autocorrelation on substrate concentration in section  [ sec41 ] , we approximated the fluctuation transition matrix with its diagonal entries .",

    "single - molecule biophysics , like many newly emerging fields , is interdisciplinary .",
