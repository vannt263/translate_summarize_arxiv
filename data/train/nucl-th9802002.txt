    "an asymmetry in the number of opposite charge pions has been observed at intermediate energies and has recently also been identified in heavy ion collisions at energies around 1 @xmath1gev @xcite , 11.4 @xmath1gev @xcite , and 158 @xmath1gev @xcite .",
    "the ratio of negative to positive pions at low pion momenta is @xmath2 at sis energies , but only @xmath3 at ags and sps energies for the central collisions of heavy nuclei as @xmath4 or @xmath5 .",
    "this effect can be explained by the coulomb interaction between the produced pions and the positive charge from the reaction partners .    at ultrarelativistic collision energies it is important to include the rapid expansion of the system and its net charge as well as retardation effects when considering the coulomb effect on particles .",
    "for rapid longitudinal bjorken expansion we find ( see @xcite for details and more elaborate calculations ) that the coulomb field decrease with time as @xmath6 and is proportional to the net charge ( proton ) rapidity distribution @xmath7 .",
    "the pions are assumed to freeze - out at time @xmath8 from a cylindrical symmetric source of transverse size @xmath9 . on average a charged pion of transverse momentum @xmath10 at freeze - out and final momentum",
    "@xmath11 receives a momentum change or `` coulomb kick '' @xmath12 for @xmath13 respectively @xmath14 the momentum change is only a slowly decreasing function of the freeze - out time .",
    "for example , @xmath15 varies @xmath1610% for @xmath17 in the range @xmath18 .",
    "the coulomb effect on the transverse particle distribution functions can be derived from particle conservation @xmath19 .",
    "the pion spectra are well reproduced by @xmath20 with @xmath21 mev at both ags and sps energies . defining @xmath22",
    "the ratio is @xmath23    the pion ratio predicted by ( [ ratio3 ] ) is compared to ags and sps data in fig .",
    "we use the experimental values for the total pion ratio @xmath24 and @xmath25 at ags and sps energies , respectively .",
    "the experimental data is well reproduced with @xmath26 mev / c and @xmath27 mev / c . from the measured proton rapidity distribution , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , and eq.([pc ] ) we can now extract the size of the systems at freeze - out : @xmath30 fm , at both ags and sps .    the coulomb effect is stronger at lower energies due to slow expansion of the net charge . a spherical and static charge of size @xmath31 changes the particle energies by the coulomb energy @xmath32 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and leads to a larger @xmath0 ratio than for the rapidly expanding case eq .",

    "( [ fig1 ] ) . with @xmath33",
    "we extract from the data @xmath34mev . with @xmath35 for the @xmath36 collisions with 14% centrality at sis we obtain @xmath37fm .",
    "the smaller charge in @xmath38 collision ( @xmath39 at sps ) leads to a smaller @xmath0 ratio that is compatible with data @xcite .",
    "kaons are heavier than pions and are less affected by coulomb fields . yet a small enhancement in the @xmath40 ratio at low @xmath41 is predicted @xcite .",
    "preliminary data from na44 @xcite shows a flat @xmath40 ratio indicating that other physics is needed such as strong interactions counter - balancing the coulomb fields .",
    "bose - einstein correlations ( hbt ) in relativistic heavy ion collisions depend sensitively on the freeze - out condition .",
    "the source sizes are measured in in the three directions , @xmath42 , referred to as the sideward , outward and longitudinal hbt radii .",
    "the theoretical interpretation is , however , very model dependent .    for",
    "a _ transparent _ source the outward hbt radius is larger than the sideward @xcite @xmath43 when opacity effects and transverse flow is ignored .",
    "here , @xmath44 is the temporal fluctuations and contains the summed squares of the duration of emission , the average of short lived resonance life - times and fluctuations in these @xcite .",
    "the difference between @xmath45 and @xmath46 is due to the temporal extent of the source during which the particles with outward velocity @xmath47 travel on average a distance @xmath48 towards the detector .    in _ opaque _",
    "sources and hydrodynamic models particles are only emitted from the surface contrary to the transparent sources where particle freeze - out in volume . by expanding for small relative momenta , @xmath49",
    ", one can express the hbt radii in terms of various fluctuations .",
    "for very opaque sources of transverse size @xmath31 , where the particle mean free path is short @xmath50 , the hbt radii can be evaluated @xcite ( @xmath31 is twice the commonly used gaussian radius parameter ) @xmath51 in @xcite the hbt radii are also calculated with transverse flow and moving surfaces . notice the different result for the transparent sources , for which @xmath52 and @xmath45 is given by ( [ r1 ] ) .",
    "the opaque source has a much smaller transverse spatial extent in the outward as in the sideward direction , @xmath53 , because the emission now take place in a narrow surface layer of order the mean free path .    in relativistic heavy ion collisions the outward and sideward hbt radii",
    "are measured to be similar @xcite and in a few cases the outward is even measured to be smaller than the sideward hbt radius @xcite contradicting eq .",
    "( [ r1 ] ) . according to eq .",
    "( [ r1 ] ) this implies that particles freeze - out suddenly , @xmath54 , as in a `` flash '' , in particular when resonance life - times are included .",
    "however , both the opacity effect and transverse flow reduce @xmath45 more than @xmath46 and so it is possible that @xmath55 .",
    "present experimental results do not allow us to draw conclusions from the small difference between @xmath45 and @xmath46 since error bars are of the same size .",
    "however , one can not use eq .",
    "( [ r1 ] ) to extract the duration of emission since opacity and transverse flow can have significant effects .",
    "wiedemann et al .",
    "@xcite have analysed the na49 data and exclude opacity effects . however , in the na49 data @xmath56 @xcite",
    ". it would therefore be interesting to investigate whether opacity effects are needed to describe the na44 data for which @xmath57 .",
    "the @xmath0 ratios at sis , ags and sps energies can be explained by coulomb effects with freeze - out radii about twice the geometrical radii of the colliding nuclei .",
    "similar freeze - out radii can be obtained from hbt analyses of @xmath46 and @xmath58 .",
    "the following freeze - out radii were extracted ( see fig . [ fig2 ] ) : + _ i ) _ from @xmath0 ratio we obtained best fits for the coulomb kick @xmath59 at ags and sps and @xmath60 at sis energies .",
    "these values allowed us to estimate the freeze - out radii .",
    "+ _ ii ) _ for a source of constant pion density the sharp cut - of radius is given by @xmath61 , where the sideward hbt radius @xmath62 fm in central @xmath4 or @xmath5 collisions at ags @xcite and sps @xcite .",
    "+ _ iii ) _ in a longitudinally expanding system with bjorken scaling the freeze - out time is related to the longitudinal hbt radius by @xmath63 . from the ags and sps data @xmath64 fm @xcite we estimate @xmath65 fm / c . assuming an initial geometrical radius @xmath666fm ( for @xmath67% centrality ) with transverse flow @xmath68 @xcite , we find a radius of @xmath69fm .",
    "+ _ iv ) _ at present it is difficult to extract information on freeze - out from @xmath45 since it is very model dependent .",
    "opacity and transverse flow effects reduce it whereas duration of emission and resonances increase it with respect to @xmath46 .",
    "we conclude that both freeze - out times extracted from the longitudinal and transverse hbt radii are at ags and sps energies and within experimental uncertainty _",
    "compatible _ with those found from @xmath0 ratios as seen from fig .",
    "the freeze - out radii are substantially larger than the geometrical radii @xmath70fm for near central collisions @xmath4 or @xmath5 nuclei indicating that expansion takes place before freeze - out .",
