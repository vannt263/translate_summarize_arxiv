    "the lack of signals from physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) revives the question of which model constitutes the most appropriate extension of the sm and , if there is one , what is the energy scale where new features of particle interactions ought to be observed .",
    "the failure of the criterion of naturalness for new physics has caused a renaissance for models which aim to accommodate as much of the present state of knowledge as possible , while ignoring the fine - tuning problem @xcite . in the construction of a realistic model beyond the sm ,",
    "one is , in principle , free to choose what features to be considered important .",
    "however , it is usually common practice that any new model should , at least , contain a unification scale compatible with a naive expectation for the proton life - time as well as a yukawa sector compatible with low - energy data .",
    "in addition , the model should allow for accommodation of a dark matter candidate as well as the baryon asymmetry of the universe .    in the present work , we will study a non - supersymmetric extension of the sm model based on the gauge group so(10 ) , which has often been discussed in the previous literature @xcite .",
    "the gauge group so(10 ) has the clear advantage that all sm fermions , including right - handed neutrinos , belong to the same @xmath4 representation .",
    "however , the realization of the mechanism for the breaking to the sm gauge group requires the presence of large higgs representations , and the consequent split of the multiplets to mass ranges differing in orders of magnitudes is an issue which , so far , has no satisfactory solutions in non - supersymmetric scenarios .",
    "ad - hoc assumptions have been introduced @xcite , which allow for the choice of the multiplets of the higgs representations taking part in the evolution of the coupling constants . in particular ,",
    "if a member of a higgs multiplet has a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , @xmath5 , corresponding to the breaking of a subgroup , then the mass of the whole multiplet is @xmath6 and will thus not contribute to the evolution of the coupling constant for energies below @xmath5 , whereas for energies above @xmath5 , the multiplet will have a mass of the order of the next , larger , mass scale where the larger symmetry appears .",
    "in general , the viability of an so(10 ) model is based on the ability to reproduce the values of fermion masses and mixings at the electroweak ( ew ) scale , @xmath7 .",
    "recent fits to fermion observables in non - supersymmetric contexts , which are discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , show that a yukawa sector with @xmath8 and @xmath9 higgs representations is , in terms of fields , the most economical choice that can accommodate all known low - energy data . to perform this task",
    ", one has either to extrapolate the values of the fermion parameters at the ew scale to the grand unified theory ( gut ) scale , @xmath10 , or in the opposite direction to impose conditions on the yukawa matrices defined at @xmath10 and evolve them down to @xmath7 .    in this work",
    ", we will use the latter approach but , contrary to the procedure usually adopted in the literature , we explicitly take into account the presence of intermediate gauge groups , characterized by a mass scale @xmath11 .",
    "in fact , besides the evolution of the coupling constants , such contributions are expected to modify the evolution of the fermion masses and mixing , introducing relations among the yukawa couplings at the same scale @xmath11 .",
    "we quantify the impact of using such new contributions in the renormalization group equations ( rges ) for fermion masses and mixings , considering an illustrative and simplified so(10 ) model with a breaking chain given by @xcite : @xmath12 where the symbols should be self - explanatory . in the present model ,",
    "the intermediate gauge group is the pati ",
    "salam ( ps ) group @xmath13 , which was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , and in the first step , the breaking of so(10 ) down to the ps group is achieved by means of a @xmath14 representation of higgs . in the next step ,",
    "the breaking of the ps group down to the sm gauge group is performed by means of a @xmath15 . at @xmath7 ,",
    "the final step of the breaking of the sm gauge group to @xmath16 is obtained with a @xmath8 , we will , however , not consider any rg running below @xmath7 .",
    "given the exploratory character of our study , we do not address other relevant open problems in so(10 ) models , such as the presence of a good dark matter candidate in the scalar spectrum or the possibility of producing the correct amount of baryon asymmetry in the universe .",
    "we will , however , pay much attention to the energy of the gut scale @xmath10 , the related coupling constant @xmath17 , and the energy of the intermediate scale @xmath11 , since they are all necessary ingredients for a correct evolution of fermion masses and mixings .",
    "the output of our analysis will be the values of the elements of the yukawa matrices at @xmath10 , which give a reasonable fit to the fermion observables at @xmath7 .",
    "these values can directly be compared to the corresponding ones obtained from an evolution without the intermediate scale starting at @xmath10 , thus allowing a quantification of the new effects introduced by the ps gauge group .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sect .",

    "we work in the framework of so(10 ) with two representations of higgs fields , namely the @xmath8 and the @xmath9 , which are both relevant for generating the fermion mass matrices . in the ps group ,",

    "the errors on the mass scales only include the propagated uncertainties from the sm coupling constants and the z boson mass .",

    "we should stress again that the main goal of this work is to quantify the effects of @xmath41 on the rges for the fermion observables rather than to construct a realistic model based on so(10 ) .",

    "note that in order to derive the fermion mass matrices one has to introduce the vev s of the appropriate higgs multiplets . in standard notation , the relevant contribution to fermion masses and mixing come from the @xmath31 submultiplet of the @xmath8 and the @xmath32 submultiplet of the @xmath9 , which can be written as k_u , d _",

    "the reason for this change of direction in the evolution can be deduced from the change of sign in front of the gauge coupling terms , which dominate the @xmath105-functions in the rges that are given in appendices [ app : a1 ] and [ app : a2 ] . as expected , in the case of the model without @xmath11 , _",
    "i.e. _  the sm case , the rg running from @xmath10 down to @xmath7 increases monotonically .",
    "thus , at the @xmath7 , the quark masses in the two cases will differ , and they will be larger in the sm case than in the model with @xmath11 .",
    "the smallest difference is for the top quark mass , which is 10  % larger at @xmath7 , whereas the largest difference is for the bottom quark mass , which is 65  % larger .",
    "the other differences at @xmath7 are 21  % , 44  % , 36  % , and 34  % for the up , down , charm , and strange quark , respectively . in general , the relative rg running for the quark masses is substantial , both with and without @xmath11 and it is essentially of the same size for both the up - type and down - type quarks .",
    "then , in fig .  [ fig : leptonmasses ] , the rg running of the lepton masses is presented . in the left plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : leptonmasses ] , we display the rg running of the charged lepton masses , which exhibits a similar pattern to that of the rg running of the quark masses for the model with @xmath11 .",
    "however , in the sm case , the rg running has the opposite direction , _",
    "i.e. _  it decreases monotonically from @xmath10 to @xmath7 .",
    "hence , at @xmath7 , all charged lepton masses are approximately 21  % smaller in the sm case than in the model with @xmath11 .",
    "note that there is no obvious cause for the decrease of the charged lepton masses and the increase of the quark masses from the rges , which are given in ref .",
    "@xcite , but rather a combined effect of several different terms in these equations . in the right plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : leptonmasses ] , we show the rg running of the quantity @xmath106 .",
    "this quantity exhibits significant rg running in both models , even though the behavior is rather different .",
    "however , this is to be expected , since the models differ most significantly in the neutrino sector .",
    "in the so - called sm , there are three seesaw scales which have a large effect on the rg running of @xmath107 . in particular , the most substantial effect is caused by the crossing of the threshold imposed by the largest heavy neutrino mass , which is around @xmath108  gev .",
    "the rg running in the model with @xmath11 is moderate from @xmath10 down to @xmath11 but significant from @xmath11 down to @xmath7 . at @xmath7 ,",
    "the value of @xmath107 is 27  % larger in the sm than in the model with @xmath11 .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig : anglerun ] , we present the rg running of the leptonic and quark mixing angles . in the left plot of fig .  [",
    "fig : anglerun ] , we display the rg running of the leptonic mixing angles .",
    "the evolution of these angles is negligible between @xmath10 and the seesaw scale for the model with @xmath11 .",
    "however , from the seesaw scale down to @xmath7 , @xmath109 increases monotonically whereas @xmath110 decreases monotonically .",
    "the rg running of @xmath111 is negligible .",
    "the exact reason for the behavior of the rg running of each parameter is difficult to pinpoint , since we evolve the yukawa matrices and not the leptonic mixing angles themselves .",
    "however , the magnitude of the rg running is what would be expected from other analyses of seesaw models ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . in the sm ,",
    "the angles are all larger at @xmath7 , with the smallest difference occurring for @xmath111 , which is only 3  % larger , and the largest difference for @xmath110 , which is 17  % larger .",
    "the difference for @xmath110 is 16  % larger . in the right plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : anglerun ] , we show the rg running of the quark mixing angles .",
    "unlike the other observables , we do not see a significant impact of @xmath11 on the evolution of the quark mixing angles , except for @xmath112 , which , in the sm , is 20  % smaller at @xmath7 .",
    "to conclude , the rg running in the model with @xmath11 is naturally rather different from previous models presented in the literature , which is clearly realized in the comparison with the sm .",
    "in this work , we have explored the effects of an intermediate energy scale on the evolution of the fermion masses and mixings in an so(10 ) model with a pati  salam intermediate gauge group .",
    "the effects have been compared to the evolution from the gut scale down to the ew scale in a sm - like model with three additional right - handed neutrinos . in order to quantify the differences between the two models , we have first determined the entries of the yukawa couplings @xmath42 and @xmath43 at the gut scale , such that the fermion observables at the ew scale are reproduced with good accuracy in this so(10 ) model .",
    "the same values of the @xmath42 and @xmath43 couplings were then used as a starting point at the gut scale for the rg running in the sm , which allows for a comparison at the ew scale . we have found that the solutions to the rges , _",
    "i.e. _ , the values of the fermion observables , at the ew scale in the sm , disagree compared to the so(10 ) model well beyond experimental uncertainties , which are at the level of 30  % for the quark masses .",
    "note that there is basically no rg running of the quark mixing angles , neither in the so(10 ) model with an intermediate energy scale nor in the sm - like model .",
    "thus , the result of our analysis is that the presence of intermediate scales has significant effects on the rg running of the fermion observables , and therefore , such intermediate scales must be taken into account in computations for a gut model with intermediate gauge groups .",
