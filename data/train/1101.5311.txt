    "the possible existence of a second critical point of water in the liquid supercooled metastable phase has been the subject of a long debate in the literature .",
    "the first hypothesis of its existence originated from the results of a computer simulation on water modeled with the st2 potential  @xcite .",
    "on the basis of those results the thermodynamic anomalies of water upon supercooling were interpreted in terms of the long range fluctuations induced by the presence of a second critical point .",
    "this critical point would be a liquid - liquid critical point ( llcp ) located at the end of the coexistence line between a low density liquid ( ldl ) phase and a high density liquid ( hdl ) phase of water . in the llcp scenario",
    ", these liquid phases would be the counterpart at higher temperature of the well - known low density amorphous ( lda ) and high density amorphous ( hda ) phases of glassy water .",
    "the hypothesis of a llcp scenario for water motivated a large number of experimental , computational and theoretical investigations  @xcite .",
    "different interpretations of the origin of the thermodynamic anomalies of water have been also proposed as alternatives to the llcp scenario . in the singularity free scenario  @xcite the anomalies of water are due to local density fluctuations and no critical phenomena take place .",
    "recently a critical point free scenario  @xcite has also been proposed in which the transition between hdl and ldl is seen as an order - disorder transition without a critical point .",
    "a number of computer simulations , performed on supercooled water with different model potentials , confirmed the plausibility of the llcp scenario  @xcite .",
    "there are also indications from experiments of the existence of the llcp in bulk water  @xcite",
    ". it would be approximately located at @xmath0  k at @xmath1  mpa .",
    "because of the difficulties of performing experiments in the region where the llcp would reside in bulk water , the possibility of observing the llcp of water in aqueous solutions that can be more easily supercooled  @xcite has been recently explored theoretically  @xcite and in computer simulations  @xcite .",
    "results compatible with the existence of a llcp have been also found in aqueous solutions of salts through thermometric experiments  @xcite .    in a recent paper  @xcite , by means of a computer simulation study of the phase diagram",
    ", we indicated the possible detection in thermometric experiments of the llcp in a nacl(aq ) solution .    since the detection of low and high density forms of water can also offer a viable path to the experimental detection of a llcp , structural properties of supercooled water and aqueous solutions are of extreme interest in this context .",
    "the structure of water and of aqueous solutions , can be studied with neutron diffraction using isotopic substitution  @xcite or by x - ray scattering  @xcite .    in the present paper we focus on the structural properties of bulk tip4p water and of the nacl(aq )",

    "molecular dynamics ( md ) computer simulations were performed on bulk water and on nacl(aq ) with concentration @xmath2  mol / kg .",

    "tip4p potential is known to well describe water properties in its liquid supercooled state  @xcite and also to be able to reproduce the very complex ices phase diagram  @xcite .",
    "the lj interaction parameters for the ions were taken from jensen and jorgensen  @xcite and the ion - water interaction parameters were calculated by using geometrical mixing rules @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",

    "these parameters were optimized for use with tip4p water and they well reproduce structural characteristics and free energies of hydration of the ions  @xcite .",

    "[ fig:6 ] , the ions seem to affect the ldl more than the hdl . the most significant difference in the hydration shells of the ions",
    "is noticed in the second shell of the cl - o rdf .",
    "we have also already mentioned that the hydration structure around the chloride ion resembles the o - o and o - h structures ( fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] ) with the chloride ion able to substitute oxygen in shells of other oxygen atoms . to further inquire this possibility and to assess the effect of the chloride ion hydration on hdl / ldl we plot together in fig .",
    "[ fig:10 ] the o - o and cl - o rdfs for hdl and ldl with distances rescaled by the respective lj interaction distance parameter @xmath6 . for the o - o pair @xmath7    as given in the tip4p model  @xcite , for the cl - o pair @xmath8    as reported in table  [ tab:1 ] .    in both ldl and hdl the first and the second shell of oxygen atoms are closer in the case of the cl - o rdf",
    "( see also fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] ) . to make a quantitative comparison we can look at the distance between the first peak and the second peak of the rdfs @xmath9 . in hdl , for the o - o pair @xmath10 , for the cl - o @xmath11 . in ldl , for the o - o pair @xmath12 and for cl - o @xmath13 ( distances in real units",
    "are obtained multiplying @xmath9 by the respective @xmath6 ) .",
    "thus we see that in ldl the chloride ion has the major effect in pulling inward its second hydration shell of oxygens . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] the main difference in the structure of the hdl and ldl is in the position of the second shell of the o - o rdfs , therefore , a possible explanation for why the presence of ions affect the ldl more than the hdl . in fact",
    "the chloride ion can take the place of the central oxygen atom in oxygen shells and can be accommodated in water - water structure at the price of bending hydrogen bonds and pulling the second shell of oxygen closer to the first shell .",
    "this can be tolerated in hdl where the molecular structure is already collapsed in the second shell  @xcite but the ldl structure results instead disrupted .",
    "in essence , the substitution of oxygen atoms by chloride atoms together with the hydrogen bond disruption caused by na@xmath14 forces the ldl structure to become more hdl - like . hence , we can understand also from a structural point of view why the region of existence of the ldl phase shrinks in the nacl(aq ) with respect to bulk water .",
    "by the use of md computer simulations , we have studied the structural properties of tip4p bulk water and of a sodium chloride solution in tip4p water with concentration @xmath2  mol / kg . in particular , we were interested in the structural differences between the two phases of water , hdl and ldl , that appear in the deep supercooled region . from our previous work",
    "@xcite we knew accurately the phase diagrams of these systems and in particular the position of the llcp .",
    "our results showed that the tip4p model can reproduce well the structural properties of the two phases of supercooled liquid water in addition to being a very good potential for the study of liquid  @xcite and solid  @xcite water thermodynamics . comparing water - water rdfs in bulk water and in nacl(aq )",
    "we have seen that the ldl is affected by the presence of ions more than the hdl , as indicated also by the shrinkage of the ldl phase observed in the study of the thermodynamics .",
    "the study of the hydration structure of ions in hdl and ldl revealed that a disturbance to the ldl structure is induced by the substitution of oxygen by chloride ions in coordination shells of other oxygen atoms .",
    "the chloride ions in fact pull inward its second shell of oxygen atoms , disrupting the ldl structure .",
    "this , together with the hydrogen bond breaking caused by the sodium ion , causes the ldl phase to be less stable in nacl(aq ) solutions and its region of existence in the thermodynamic plane to reduce , with a consequent shift of the liquid - liquid coexistence line and of the llcp to lower pressures with respect to bulk water .",
    "since from our thermodynamic results we hypothesize that the llcp region is above the nucleation line in this solution , an observation of the structural features presented in this paper in x - ray and neutron scattering experiments , can also represent a viable route for experimentalists to solve the quest of the llcp in bulk water . along this line experimental indications of a hdl and ldl phase coexistence and llcp have been recently found  @xcite .",
