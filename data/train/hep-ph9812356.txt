    "the recent clear observation of neutrino oscillations @xcite indicates the non - zero masses for the neutrinos @xcite , which are generally considered to be extremely small due to the following mechanisms .",
    "the common form of neutrino mass matrix is expressed through three terms :    1 .",
    "the majorana mass @xmath1 for the left - handed neutrino , that appears as the triplet weak isospin contribution , 2 .",
    "the dirac mass term @xmath2 , involving the interaction with the sterile right - handed neutrino @xmath3 , 3 .",
    "the majorana mass @xmath4 for the singlet @xmath3 over the weak interaction .",
    "then the lagrangian part , determining the neutrino mass , is equal to @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes the charge conjugation .",
    "the following possibilities are generally discussed .",
    "the first is the absence of sterile @xmath3 , that means there is the only contribution due to the majorana term @xmath1 .",
    "if it is caused by the vacuum expectation @xmath7 of standard higgs , being the isodoublet , then the triplet mass is the square of @xmath7 .",
    "hence , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 appears from an extension of sm , and it is of large scale .",
    "second , the singlet contribution is determined by the physics beyond the sm , so that @xmath10 , where @xmath2 is usually taken in the range , corresponding to the mass scale for the charged fermions , @xmath11",
    ". then the see - saw mechanism @xcite leads to two spices of neutrinos with the small and large masses , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , correspondingly .",
    "these scenarios ( just beyond a super - physics ) generally exhaust the natural explanations for the smallness of neutrino masses .",
    "anyway , the experimental data put @xmath14 ev , which means @xmath15 gev .",
    "note , that we do not know how the small dirac masses can be naturally explained with no involvement of large sterile majorana mass .    in the present paper",
    "we offer the scheme , wherein the neutrinos have zero masses in the standard model and acquire the smallness after an extension of sm to include the right - handed neutral currents .",
    "we suggest some non - trivial vacuum correlators , which determine the mass scales in connection to the gauge charges of fermions .",
    "thus , it happens that the large scale @xmath9 is related to the mass of @xmath0 .",
    "from ( [ eq:3a ] ) we deduce that the coupling of vacuum expectations , causing the dirac masses , is determined by the charges of fermions , so that , say , for the neutrino the electric charge equal to zero results in the massless , which , thus , looks quite natural in the sm with the suggested mechanism for the mass generation .",
    "sure , we could introduce the local source , i.e. the higgs field , for the vacuum expectation considered in the model above and make the legendre transformation to substitute the field for the condensates .",
    "then , we believe , the action would take the most usual form - action @xmath26 - \\int dx \\phi(x ) j(x , x)+{\\rm h.c.}\\ ] ] to the bare order the equation of motion for the bi - local field results in the straightforward substitution of local field @xmath27 , as it stands in the above consideration for the correlators , developing the vacuum expectation values . after the analysis of divergences in the @xmath28-dependent green functions",
    ", the corresponding counter terms must be added to the action .",
    "then the @xmath28-source can be integrated out , that believes to result in the @xmath27-higgs action , containing the couplings to fermions as well as the suitable potential to develop the spontaneous breaking of symmetry . ] .",
    "suppose that there is the additional @xmath29 local symmetry spontaneously broken at a scale @xmath30 ( for the sake of explicitness we put @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) .",
    "to minimize possible virtual corrections at low energies precisely studied up to the lep measurements and to reproduce the mass relations between the standard gauge bosons , we have to introduce the additional higgs field , being the doublet over @xmath29 , which possesses zero charges over @xmath33 of the sm .",
    "the important challenge is that the standard higgs has to be extended to the field , belonging to the ( @xmath34 ) representation of @xmath35 .",
    "the reason is the desirable renormalizability of the field theory with the spontaneously broken symmetry .",
    "indeed , the fermion mass term @xmath36 certainly is of ( @xmath34 ) , so that the corresponding higgs developing the vev must have the same quantum numbers over the local group .",
    "it can be , say , @xmath37 . in the current discussion",
    "we can suppose that the right - handed doublets are @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "then the charged @xmath29-like gauge bosons are the vector leptoquarks , that can be the reason for the very different physics in the left- and right - handed sectors . ] .",
    "next , the non - zero vevs of neutral higgs fields result in the massless of the photon and lead to the massive neutral currents .",
    "the mass matrix for the local gauge fields @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 is determined by the form @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 denote the gauge fields couplings for the @xmath47 group .",
    "then the eigenvalues of the mass matrix are equal to @xmath48 which in the limit of infinitely large @xmath49 tend to the following relations : @xmath50 \\approx \\frac{1}{4 } v_r^2 g_r^2 . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] furthermore , it is quite evident to derive that the masses of charged gauged bosons are given by @xmath51 .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , we see that up to small corrections the @xmath52 boson mass reproduces the value of standard boson as it is connected to the @xmath53 mass .",
    "the matrix @xmath54 , transforming the gauge fields to the mass eigen - states , has the form @xmath55 with the accuracy up to @xmath56 , where @xmath57 , and @xmath58 is the standard angle by weinberg . in the approximation under consideration",
    "we can see that @xmath54 has the orthogonal form , and the transposition results in the inverse matrix , @xmath59 so that the admixture of @xmath0 in @xmath41 is determined by the ratio of @xmath60 .",
    "the vertices of massive eigen - states are determined by the following relations :    1 .",
    "the photon couples to the electric charge @xmath61 2 .",
    "the left - handed fermions have the standard couplings to @xmath52 @xmath62 3 .",
    "the right - handed fermions acquire the correction to the charge with @xmath52 @xmath63 4 .",
    "the @xmath0 vertex to the left - handed fermions is proportional to that of @xmath52 one , so that @xmath64 and the suppression is due to the smallness of @xmath60 . 5 .",
    "@xmath0 has the charge @xmath65 to the right - handed fermions .",
    "so , some anomalous couplings are introduced due to the @xmath0 physics .",
    "note , that , first , other correlations result in less contributions to the masses , as those are suppressed by powers of @xmath73 .",
    "second , the corrections to the masses of electrically charged fermions seem to be suppressed in the same manner .    thus , we see that due to the extension of model to the right - handed local group the neutrinos have the dirac mass of the order of @xmath74 , where - from we extract @xmath75 gev .",
    "if @xmath30 is so large , the current experimental bounds on the anomalous couplings of gauge bosons and the appearance of @xmath0 @xcite are far away from what is expected from the small neutrino masses .",
    "the other possibility is to assume the existence of additional sterile neutrino mass @xmath4 , which activates the see - saw mechanism , but in the model , where the dirac mass can be essentially reduced from @xmath76 gev by several orders of magnitude due to the suppression @xmath73 .",
    "the arrangement of vacuum expectation values for the spontaneous breaking of the local gauge symmetries can be reasonably related to the following qualitative peculiarities , belonging to the corresponding invariant actions .",
    "so , we observe :    * the abelian @xmath77-field , coupled in the vector - like way to the fermions of both chiralities , does not appear in the spontaneously breaking phase . * the non - abelian @xmath78 field , possessing the asymptotic freedom ,",
    "is coupled , again , in the vector - like way to the fermions , and it does not acquire the spontaneous breaking of symmetry , too .",
    "however , the back - wise face of asymptotic freedom is the confinement . * the non - abelian @xmath79-field , coupled to the chiral fermions , exposes the spontaneous breaking .",
    "the presence of asymptotic freedom for the latter symmetry depends on the set of matter fields . in what follows",
    ", we exploit the situation , when @xmath79 is asymptotically free .",
    "let us offer the following picture . the structure of vector - like gauge symmetries , i.e. the form of effective potential , preserves them from the developing of non - trivial vacuum correlations , determining the spontaneous breaking of invariances .",
    "the non - abelian theory with chiral fermions does possess the effective action , where the vacuum correlations appear , if the coupling constant is greater than a critical value @xmath80 .",
    "then in gut @xcite with @xmath81 , the chiral @xmath79 will develop the symmetry breaking vev at a low scale @xmath82 , where its coupling @xmath83 will reach the critical value . that can be the reason for the very different values of @xmath84 and @xmath82 . note , that in this approach we know the value of critical constant @xmath80 , since it is well measured in the weak interactions , so that @xmath85 .",
    "as for the neutrino mass generation described above , we are ready to conclude , that the difference between the renormalization group properties , determining the coupling running , for the left- and right - handed symmetries will result in the hierarchy of scales for their characteristic vevs .    to be more concrete , consider the gauge symmetry for the right - handed fermions , embedded to the following @xmath29-like doublets : @xmath86 the essential difference from the usual @xmath79 is that the charged vector bosons , possessing the fractional electric charge @xmath87 , are the color triplet @xmath88 and anti - triplet @xmath89 , appropriately .",
    "the corresponding generalized derivative , acting on the fermions , has the form @xmath90 where @xmath91 are the pauli matrices , and the superscript @xmath92 runs over the color anti - triplet and the subscript @xmath92 does the color triplet .",
    "it is quite clear , that , including the quark colors , the `` doublets '' in ( [ eq:10 ] ) could represent the @xmath93 fundamental multiplet , if the couplings of @xmath46 for the right - handed fermions and @xmath94 in @xmath78 would be equal each to other .",
    "if we `` switch off '' the color indexes from the group transformations , the corresponding invariance @xmath95 is @xmath96 on the right - handed fermions .",
    "as we have mentioned , the @xmath95 symmetry is very similar to the famous @xmath79 .",
    "the straightforward consideration leads to that we can reproduce the one - loop calculations for the running of @xmath46 from the corresponding evaluation for @xmath79 , if we substitute for @xmath97 at @xmath98 by @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the number of colors , and for @xmath101 by @xmath102 .",
    "the running of coupling constants in the @xmath103 field theory is given by the expression @xmath104 where @xmath105 depends on the set of fields .",
    "so , @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the number of chiral fermions , @xmath108 is the number of fundamental scalar multiplets .",
    "therefore , for the @xmath49-coefficients of @xmath109 we get @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the number of fermion generations , @xmath112 are the numbers of corresponding scalars .",
    "next , the @xmath77 coupling constant , normalized as @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is the weak hyper - charge , has the coefficient @xmath115 equal to @xmath116 where we have taken into account the hyper - charge of additional weak doublet due to the extension of standard higgs by @xmath95 : @xmath117 where the fractionally charged higgses are the color anti - triplets with the hyper - charge @xmath118 .",
    "so , @xmath119 denotes the number of standard higgses .",
    "( 130,80 ) ( 0,0 ) ( 0,80)@xmath120 ( 120,0)@xmath121 $ ] ( 10,65)@xmath122 ( 10,40)@xmath123 ( 10,22)@xmath124 ( 58,17)@xmath125    let us discuss the scalar field set , suitable for the problem . first , the number of left - symmetric higgses includes @xmath126 doublets . in realistic models for the generation replication and their mixing , the number of standard higgses usually repeats the number of generations @xcite .",
    "so , we put @xmath127 second , the right - symmetric scalars are those of extensions for the standard higgs and that of @xmath128 singlet to separately break the @xmath95-symmetry .",
    "we put @xmath129 further , we can look at the evolution of couplings to large scales as it is shown in fig.[gut ] , and draw the conclusion on the plausible unification of symmetries at @xmath130 gev .",
    "we present this picture for the illustration of other feature : the @xmath131 coupling reaches the critical region , @xmath132 , at the scales , which are only one or two orders of magnitude less than the gut energy because of the appropriate properties in the renormalization group .",
    "of course , the numerical estimate qualitatively depends on @xmath133 , which can vary over the structure of right - handed symmetry .",
    "another note concerns the extra - higgses , which , according to the evolution performed , are much lighter than @xmath84 .    as for the model under discussion",
    ", we could add only that , obviously , there is the right - handed symmetry at @xmath84 : @xmath93 with the violation in the way @xmath134 .    to complete , we have to emphasize that the correlators in ( [ eq:7])-([eq:8 ] ) belong to the @xmath135 representation over @xmath136 , and , hence , contribute , a little bit , to vev of the extended higgs , and not to the @xmath95-doublet , developing the @xmath30 scale itself .",
    "we have shown how the model of mass generation can be constructed on the basis of higgs mechanism , wherein the scalar isodoublet field is related to the vacuum correlations and fermion charges , so that    * the neutrino is massless in the standard model because of its zero electric charge , * the smallness of neutrino masses can be caused by the hierarchy of the correlation scales for the spontaneous breaking of the standard local symmetry and the right - handed extension , @xmath137 , which leads to the dirac kind of mass , * the unification of coupling constants makes @xmath30 to be only one or two orders of magnitude less than @xmath84 , * we could reduce the scale of sterile majorana mass by involving both the see - saw mechanism and suppressed dirac terms due to the above approach .",
    "finally , the author would like to express the gratitude to prof .",
    "a.wagner and members of desy theory group for their kind hospitality during my visit to desy , where this paper was written , as well as to prof . a.k.likhoded for discussions .",
