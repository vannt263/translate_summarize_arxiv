    "<S> if the strings have attractive interactions , they may at low temperatures be bound together to a bundle . </S>",
    "<S> such bundles of strings have been studied by numerical diagonalization of the transfer matrix @xcite , in a local density functional theory @xcite , by mapping onto a quantum spin chain @xcite , in a heuristic scaling picture @xcite , and by field - theoretic renormalization group methods @xcite .    in this paper </S>",

    "<S> we modify the contact interaction so as to impose a _ preferred ordering _ on the strings while _ preserving integrability_. hence we construct a _ </S>",

    "<S> the strings are infinitely extended and run , on average , parallel to the @xmath2direction . </S>",

    "<S> the effective hamiltonian for the bundle is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the interaction potential for the string pair with @xmath7 and @xmath8 . </S>",

    "<S> this expression for the free energy agrees with the result in @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> both mean separations ( [ mad ] ) and ( [ mab2 ] ) are characterized by the critical behaviour @xmath42 the continuum description used here is justified as long as the mean separation between the inner strings is greater than the string thickness @xmath43 which implies @xmath44 .    </S>",

    "<S> the unbinding of @xmath0 strings can be understood heuristically in the framework of a @xmath0state model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if one makes the plausible assumption that locally bound triplets and higher  order multiplets of strings are less likely than locally bound pairs , one finds that the unbinding of the bundle is governed by the unbinding of string pairs . </S>",
    "<S> this explains that the unbinding temperature does not depend on @xmath0 as has been observed in numerical studies for @xmath58 and @xmath59 @xcite . on the other hand , these numerical studies lead to an effective critical exponent @xmath18 which is nonuniversal and depends on @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the total interaction potential studied numerically contains only contributions from neighbouring pairs of strings . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast the total interaction potential @xmath60 studied here contains contributions from _ all _ pairs . </S>",
    "<S> the difference corresponds to a 3string interaction which must be added to @xmath60 and which is effectively repulsive . </S>",
    "<S> such an interaction represents a marginally irrelevant perturbation and therefore leads to large corrections to scaling which should explain the @xmath0-dependence found in the numerical work @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> next , consider the unbinding of the string bundle from a wall . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0string system now experiences an additional external potential consisting of an attractive well and a hard wall . </S>",

    "<S> all @xmath0 strings unbind simultaneously from the wall at @xmath80 . in regime ( fb ) with @xmath81 and @xmath79 the strings form a free ( or unbound ) bundle . for @xmath78 , the strings unbind successively . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath82th string ( counted from the wall ) peels from the wall at @xmath83 . for @xmath78 and @xmath84 </S>",

    "<S> when the point @xmath89 is approached from regime ( @xmath74 ) the strings unbind simultaneously from the wall as well as from each other .    across all phase boundaries , both the free energy @xmath90 and its first derivative @xmath91 are continuous whereas the second derivative @xmath92 exhibits a discontinuity . </S>",
    "<S> hence these transitions are of second order with the critical exponent @xmath93 for the specific heat . at the phase boundary between ( @xmath74 ) and ( @xmath94 ) , the mean separations @xmath95 with @xmath96 are continuous but their first derivatives @xmath97 exhibit a jump . </S>",
    "<S> the critical behaviour of the diverging length scales is the same at each transition line , even at the point @xmath89 , with the @xmath0-independent exponent @xmath98 .    in a real system , </S>",
    "<S> regime ( @xmath74 ) and regime ( fs ) are attained at sufficiently low and sufficiently high temperatures , respectivly . </S>",
    "<S> depending on the relative strength of the string  string and the string  wall attraction , the temperature trajectory will move from ( @xmath74 ) to ( fs ) via the free bundle regime ( fb ) or the intermediate states ( @xmath99 ) . in the latter case one </S>",

    "<S> as @xmath112 approaches @xmath107 from above , the mean separation of the bundle from the wall scales as @xmath113 within the mean  field theory whereas the correct critical behaviour is given by @xmath114 with @xmath98 .    </S>",
    "<S> the transition from regime ( @xmath74 ) to regime ( @xmath94 ) occurs at @xmath115 . in this case </S>",

    "<S> the strings with @xmath120 are densely packed ; the strings with @xmath121 are swollen and should exhibit the power law tail as in ( [ mfdenpt ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the swollen region contains @xmath122 strings .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have obtained analytic results on the unbinding transition and density profiles of bundles of @xmath123-dimensional strings both for a free bundle and for a bundle interacting with a rigid wall . </S>",
    "<S> the critical behaviour we have found here should apply to all pair potentials which decay faster than @xmath124 for large @xmath125 and hence belong to the strong  fluctuation regime . </S>",
    "<S> in general , many  string forces are present as well ; for example , the force between two strings may be screened by a third string in between . </S>",
    "<S> renormalization group arguments @xcite as well as the scaling picture of @xcite show that such screening forces do not alter the asymptotic scaling . with large _ attractive </S>",

    "<S> another interesting problem are strings interacting via short  ranged pair potentials in @xmath126 dimensions . for @xmath127 , two strings exhibit continuous unbinding transitions @xcite , and one would expect that the associated critical behaviour also applies to string bundles with @xmath128 . </S>",
