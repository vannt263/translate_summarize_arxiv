    "the ozi rule @xcite forbids creation of @xmath2  mesons in the interaction of non - strange particles .",
    "the production of , for instance , @xmath24   meson is allowed only via presence of the light quark component in the @xmath24   wave function .",
    "the amount of this component is determined by the deviation of mixing angle of the vector nonet from the ideal mixing angle , for the ideal mixing angle @xmath24   should be a pure @xmath2  state .",
    "the ozi rule predicts that in all hadron reactions the ratio between the cross sections of @xmath24   and @xmath25   production @xmath26 should be : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a ratio of phase spaces of the reactions .",
    "this prediction was tested many times in experiments using different hadron beams .",

    "the weighted average ratio of cross sections of @xmath24   and @xmath25  production at different energies in nucleon - nucleon interactions is somewhat higher , but still qualitatively similar to the ozi value ( [ rfi ] ) : @xmath30    the corresponding value for antiproton  annihilation   in flight is : @xmath31    these experiments indicate that the naive ozi rule for the vector meson production is generally valid within 10@xmath32 accuracy .",
    "this is not so bad for a heuristic model , bearing in mind that the ozi prediction is based only on the value of the mixing angle derived from meson masses , and applied at different energies from 100 mev till 100 gev .    from the point of view of theory",
    ", it is realized that the ozi rule reflects important feature of the hadron interactions - suppression of the flavor mixing transitions .",
    "it reflects the absence of the processes with pure gluonic intermediate states .",
    "the value of the flavor mixing is channel - dependent .",
    "it is large for the pseudoscalar and scalar channels . for other channels",

    "\\2 ) the violation of the ozi - rule is not - universal for all annihilation   channels of @xmath24   production but mystically occurs only in some of them .",
    "for instance , no enhancement of @xmath24   production is observed for the @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) or @xmath45 ( @xmath46 @xcite ) channels .",

    "it was clearly demonstrated by the obelix collaborations results : @xmath47    \\4 ) there is a serious indication that the degree of the ozi rule violation depends on the momentum transfer .",
    "to explain the huge violation of the ozi rule in the annihilation of stopped antiprotons and its strong dependence on the spin of the initial state , the model based on a nucleon wave function containing negatively polarized @xmath48 pairs was proposed @xcite .",
    "the model claims that the observed ozi violation is only apparent because in these processes the @xmath2  meson is created via _ connected _ diagrams with participation of intrinsic nucleon strange quarks .",
    "the strong dependence on the initial quantum numbers is due to polarization of the strange sea .",
    "let us discuss these assumptions in more details .",
    "let us consider the production of @xmath2   strangeonia in @xmath49 or @xmath50 interactions assuming that the nucleon wave function contains an admixture of @xmath2 pairs which are polarized negatively with respect to the direction of the nucleon spin .    due to the interaction it is possible that these pairs could be shaken - out from the nucleon or strange quarks from different nucleons could participate in some rearrangement process similar to one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] .",
    "let us assume further that the quantum numbers of the @xmath2  pair is @xmath51 ( later we will explain this choice ) .",
    "then the shake - out of such pairs will not create @xmath24   or tensor @xmath58  meson , but a scalar strangeonium .",
    "the @xmath2   systems with other quantum numbers ( like @xmath24   or @xmath58 ) should produce due to the process where strange quarks from _ both _ nucleons are participating .",
    "an example of this rearrangement diagram is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] . if the nucleon spins are parallel ( fig .",
    "[ fig:8]a ) , then the spins of the @xmath52 and @xmath53 quarks in both nucleons are also parallel . if the polarization of the strange quarks does not change during the interaction , then the @xmath52 and @xmath53 quarks will have parallel spins in the final state .",
    "the total spin of @xmath2   quarks will be @xmath59 and if their relative orbital momentum is @xmath60 , it means that the strangeonium has the @xmath24   quantum numbers , if @xmath61 , it will correspond to the creation of tensor strangeonium , @xmath62 .    if the initial @xmath49 state is a spin - singlet , the spins of strange quarks in different nucleons are antiparallel and the rearrangement diagrams like that in fig.[fig:8]b may lead to the preferential formation of the @xmath2   system with total spin @xmath63",
    "it means that for @xmath60 one should expect an additional production of strangeonia with the pseudoscalar quantum numbers @xmath57 .",
    "there are two important aspects of this scheme : the choice of the quantum number of the @xmath2   pair in the nucleon and notion that it is just rearrangement rather than shake - out processes are responsible for the @xmath2   mesons production .    in principle",
    "there are different possibilities for the quantum numbers of the @xmath2   component in the nucleon wave function .",
    "it may have , for instance , pseudoscalar quantum numbers @xmath64 or vector @xmath65 ones .",
    "then the relative angular momentum @xmath66 between the @xmath2   and @xmath67 cluster with @xmath68 should be @xmath69 . however , it is also possible that the @xmath2  pair has quantum numbers of the vacuum @xmath70 , then @xmath71 to provide quantum numbers of proton .",
    "it is up to the experiment to determine which of these possibilities are realized in nature .",
    "if the nucleon @xmath2   pair has quantum numbers of @xmath24-meson it will lead to serious problems . in this case one might expect some additional @xmath24   production due to the strangeness , stored in the nucleon .",
    "this quasi-@xmath24   pair could be easily shaken - out from the nucleon .",
    "then it is not clear how to explain the strong dependence of the @xmath24   yield on quantum numbers of _ both _ nucleons , observed at lear experiments .",
    "similar arguments were provided in @xcite , where it was demonstrated that the experimental data on the production of @xmath72 and @xmath73 mesons exclude the @xmath57 quantum numbers for the @xmath2   admixture in the nucleon wave function .    in @xcite",
    "it was argued that the strange nucleon sea may be negatively polarized due to the interaction of the light valence quarks with the qcd vacuum . due to the chiral dynamics",
    "the interaction between quarks and antiquarks is most strong in the pseudoscalar @xmath74 sector .",
    "this strong attraction in the spin ",
    "singlet pseudoscalar channel between light valence quark from the proton wave function and a strange antiquark from the qcd vacuum will result in the spin of the strange antiquark which will be aligned opposite to the spin of the light quark ( and , finally , opposite to the proton spin ) . as strange antiquark comes from the vacuum , the corresponding strange quark to preserve the vacuum quantum numbers @xmath51",
    "should also be aligned opposite to the nucleon spin .",
    "therefore , we arrive to the picture of the negatively polarized @xmath2   pair with the vacuum quantum numbers @xmath76 .",
    "these strange quarks should not be considered like constituent quarks formed some five quarks configuration of the nucleon .",
    "rather they are included in the components of a constituent quark .",
    "it is important to stress that the @xmath2   pair with the @xmath76 quantum numbers itself is not polarized being a scalar .",
    "that is a chiral non  perturbative interaction which selects only one projection of the total spin of the @xmath2   pair on the direction of the nucleon spin .",
    "since the quantum numbers of the @xmath2  pair in nucleon are fixed to be @xmath76 , it is clear that the shake - out of this state is not relevant for the @xmath24  meson production .",
    "the rearrangement diagrams like those in fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] are responsible for an additional source of @xmath24  production .",
    "so on top of the @xmath24   production via standard reaction of mixing with light quarks there is an additional source of @xmath2   meson production due to intrinsic nucleon strangeness .",
    "the rearrangement nature of this mechanism implies that two nucleon should participate in it .",
    "this means a dependence on quantum numbers of both nucleons as well as appearance of some minimal momentum transfer from which this additional mechanism becomes important .",
    "it explains the @xmath77 dependence of ratio @xmath78 for different reactions of @xmath37 annihilation at rest shown in fig .",
    "indeed , the largest ozi - violation has been observed for the reactions with the largest momentum transfer to @xmath24 . that is pontecorvo reaction @xmath79 and @xmath80 processes .",
    "the kinematics of antiproton  annihilation   at rest restricts the variation of momentum transfer .",
    "it is important to study the dependence of the violation of ozi rule on momentum transfer directly for annihilation   in flight .",
    "the rearrangement nature of additional @xmath24   production allows to make some interesting prediction concerning annihilation   into the @xmath81 final state .",
    "this channel was measured by the obelix collaboration @xcite for the @xmath82 annihilation at rest in liquid hydrogen , gas at ntp and at low pressure of @xmath83 mbar .",
    "the @xmath84 final state has the same @xmath85 as the @xmath86 final state .",
    "so , one may expect to see the same selection rule as eqs.([rfi1])-([rfi2 ] ) and suppose that the @xmath24  production in the low pressure sample will be suppressed .",
    "however , absolutely unexpectedly , the reverse trend is seen : the yield of the @xmath87 channel grows with decreasing of the target density .",
    "the branching ratio for annihilation   from the @xmath88 state turns out to be by 10 times higher than that of the @xmath89 state : @xmath90          polarized strangeness model treats these facts as demonstration of the momentum transfer dependence : the momentum transfer in the @xmath81 reaction is too small for rearrangement diagrams start working .",
    "so no ozi rule violation should be neither for annihilation   from the s - wave nor from the p - wave .",
    "the ratio @xmath92 should remain small in the p - wave .",
    "therefore ten times increasing of the @xmath93 yield for annihilation   from the p - wave is predicted .",
    "the rearrangement nature of the additional strangeness production implies strong consequences for the possible amount of strange quarks in the nucleon .",
    "indeed , let us estimate how many additional @xmath24   are creating due to intrinsic nucleon strangeness .",
    "assuming the validity of the ozi rule and starting from branching ratio @xmath94 @xcite for the annihilation   from the @xmath89 state , one may calculate the branching ratio of @xmath95 reaction via normal ozi - allowed mixing .",
    "it will give @xmath96 , which should be compared with the experimental value of @xmath97 @xcite .",
    "let us assume that all additional @xmath24 s are coming from the nucleon intrinsic strangeness due to the two - nucleon rearrangement and try to estimate ( in a rather crude manner ) the amount of strange quarks admixture in the nucleon which is nedeed to create this surplus of @xmath24  .",
    "the proton wave function is decomposing in two parts : @xmath98 where @xmath99 stands for any number of gluons and light @xmath100 pairs .",
    "the normalization of the non - strange and strange parts of the wave function is @xmath101 ( neglecting the admixture of more than one @xmath2  pair ) .",
    "the amplitude of the @xmath2   meson production should be proportional to @xmath102 due to the rearrangement nature of the process where strange quarks from both nucleons should participate :        let us assume that @xmath105 .",
    "then the ratio r of the _ amplitudes _ for the @xmath106 and @xmath107 final state is @xmath108 using experimental data for the additional strangeness production , one could obtain that @xmath109 , it means that @xmath110 .    of course",
    ", one should not consider this estimation literally , as demonstration that the lear experiments found the 20% strangeness component in the nucleon .",
    "the approximation @xmath105 is too crude and the reality may differ on some factor .",
    "but what is clear : the rearrangement diagrams mean the @xmath102 dependence of the @xmath24   production amplitude and degree of the observed ozi violation ( [ rgamma])-([rpitwo ] ) is so high that indeed implies the contribution of the strange quarks in the nucleon at the level of 10 - 20% .      the predictions of the polarized strangeness model have been tested in different reactions .",
    "the detailed review of the present status of the model is given in @xcite . here",
    "i would like to comment only few recent experimental results :      we already discussed that the ratio @xmath112 shown in fig .",
    "[ ozi ] turns out to be unusually high .",
    "it is even greater than the corresponding ratio for the annihilation on a free nucleon @xmath113 in liquid hydrogen and twice as large as the ratio measured in hydrogen gas at ntp .",
    "usually , the pontecorvo reactions are considered as two - step processes @xcite .",
    "first , two mesons are created in the @xmath114 annihilation on a single nucleon of the deuteron and then one of them is absorbed by the spectator nucleon . in this approach , the ozi violation in the pontecorvo reaction @xmath115 is simply a reflection of its violation in the elementary act @xmath113 .",
    "however recently the two - step model explanations are in serious doubts after measurements by the crystal barrel collaboration of the pontecorvo reactions with open strangeness @xcite : @xmath116 it was found @xcite that the yields of these reactions are practically equal , + @xmath117 , in a sheer discrepancy with two - step models prediction @xcite that the @xmath118 production ( [ sk ] ) should be about 100 times less than @xmath23   production .",
    "it was predicted @xcite that @xmath119 .",
    "this hierarchy appears naturally in the two - step models due to the fact that the @xmath120 cross section is larger than the @xmath121 one .",
    "it has been pointed out in @xcite that the negative polarization of the strange sea should lead to the negative longitudinal polarization of the @xmath23  hyperons formed in the target fragmentation region in the lepton deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) .",
    "the idea is that the polarization of the @xmath53 quark transfers to the final state polarization of the @xmath23  hyperon after an intermediate boson hits a valence quark of the nucleon .",
    "recent nomad data on @xmath124 dis @xcite have demonstrated that the @xmath23   longitudinal polarization in the target fragmentation region is indeed large and negative : @xmath125 .",
    "remarkably , in the current fragmentation region this polarization is significantly less : @xmath126 .",
    "the measurements of @xmath23   polarization with significantly large statistics is planned at compass experiment on @xmath127 dis .",
    "the polarized strangeness model assumes an anticorrelation between spins of the proton and s - quarks .",
    "then it is natural to predict a negative value for depolarization @xmath129 measured in the @xmath23   production in polarized proton interactions @xmath130 .",
    "recent measurements of disto collaboration @xcite indeed have confirmed this prediction .",
    "the same effect is expected for the depolarization of @xmath23   produced in antiproton   interactions with polarized protons @xmath131 .",
    "however preliminary results of the ps 185 experiment presented at this conference @xcite show that @xmath129 is quite small but the spin transfer to @xmath132  @xmath133 is unusually high and positive .",
    "there are versions of the polarized strangeness model where the spin of proton is indeed mainly transferred to @xmath132   rather than to @xmath23 .",
    "but in these modifications the @xmath133 should be still negative .",
