    "the mixing induced cp asymmetry for @xmath6 has been shown to depend on only the weak phase @xmath7 and there is no uncertainty from hadronic matrix elements@xcite . @xmath8 factory is expected to yield information , not only on @xmath6 asymmetry but also on various other @xmath8 meson decays .",
    "it has been predicted that @xmath1 , @xmath9 decay modes may have large cp asymmetries@xcite . while branching ratios for these modes are very sensitive to the input parameters , cp asymmetries are expected to be less sensitive .",

    "the time dependent cp asymmetry for @xmath10 transition , where @xmath11 is cp eigenstate , is given by@xcite : @xmath12 where @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is defined by the ratio of the decay amplitudes , @xmath15 . for the sake of convenience ,",
    "we denote the direct cp asymmetry proportional to @xmath16 by @xmath17 and the mixing induced cp asymmetry proportional to @xmath18 by @xmath19 , @xmath20 in general , a decay amplitude has two kinds of contributions : so - called tree amplitude ; and penguin amplitude . the decay amplitude for @xmath21 can be written as @xmath22 where @xmath23 are kobayashi - maskawa(km ) matrix elements , and @xmath24 are decay amplitudes with strong final state interaction phases for tree and penguin contributions , respectively .",

    "cp asymmetry is classified into the following four types depending on the relationship between tree and penguin contributions .    1 .",
    "if @xmath43 has the same weak phase as @xmath44 , @xmath45 , the hadronic matrix elements are canceled in @xmath35 . then the direct cp asymmetry vanishes and the mixing induced cp asymmetry is strictly given by the weak phase @xmath40 , @xmath46 in the @xmath6 decay mode , this is the case @xcite .",

    "higher twist contributions should be studied .",
    "these will be done in the future . for",
    "now , we assume that these corrections will not exceed @xmath130% in the amplitude .",
    "the error @xmath150 is @xmath153 with such higher order corrections .",
    "because the factorizable tree amplitude has color suppression in @xmath154 , @xmath155 decay modes , and the tree amplitude comes from only annihilation diagram in @xmath156 decay mode , their decay modes have @xmath157 .",
    "considering km factor , @xmath158 for @xmath159 and @xmath160 for @xmath1 , table [ tb : ra ] shows that the penguin contribution is dominant in @xmath161 , @xmath155 decay modes and comparable with that of tree in @xmath162 , @xmath163 , and @xmath164 decay modes . in pqcd , the decay amplitudes are given by integrating the convolution of wave functions , hard amplitude , and wilson s coefficient , over loop momenta .",
    "therefore , the dependence on the wave functions does not cancel completely in the ratio @xmath87 .",
    "this leads to blobs shown in figs.[fig : r ] .",
    "uncertainty in km factors , decay constants , and parameters in the wave functions exerts an influence on the branching ratios .",
    "we elect the central values for the km factors@xcite and @xmath8 meson s decay constant @xmath165 mev@xcite in figs.[fig : r ] .",

    "so , for now , we leave aside the error from the higher order corrections . from the allowed range of @xmath87",
    ", we compute the cp asymmetry using eqs . , .",
    "the results are shown in figs.[fig : dircp ] , [ fig : cpasym_pipi ] .",
    "they are summarized in table [ tb : asym_dir ] .",
    "now the higher order corrections are added to the result shown in table [ tb : asym_dir ] in quadrature .",
    "it results in @xmath166% uncertainty for @xmath104 .",
    "the measured cp asymmetries have been presented in ref.@xcite , where belle collaboration gives @xmath167 at @xmath168% confidence level , and babar collaboration gives @xmath169 .",
    "they are not inconsistent with our predictions .",
    "although the relative error of @xmath149 is @xmath151 without higher order corrections , the mixing induced cp asymmetry for @xmath170 , @xmath171 , has small uncertainty , @xmath172 .",
    "this is because the magnitude of @xmath87 is small , @xmath173 . since @xmath105 has zeroth order term in expansion of @xmath149 , the error @xmath174 is proportional to @xmath175 : @xmath176 the factor @xmath177 leads to small uncertainty for @xmath105 .",
    "the error from the higher order corrections is also suppressed by the factor @xmath175 , and the total error for @xmath105 is estimated at @xmath178% . in contradistinction to @xmath105 , the direct cp asymmetry has large uncertainty .",
    "since @xmath179 is not suppressed by @xmath175 , @xmath180 the direct cp asymmetry is more sensitive to @xmath87 compared to the mixing induced cp asymmetry .",
    "similar errors are assigned to @xmath181 and @xmath164 .",
    "the mixing induced cp asymmetry for @xmath182 , @xmath183 , has little uncertainty .",
    "here the factorizable tree amplitude is subjected to color suppression , and the penguin amplitude without km factor is comparable to that of the tree , @xmath184 .",
    "however , km factor , @xmath185 , is very large and it makes the penguin contribution dominant . since @xmath186 , the first term in the numerator and denominator can be neglected in eq . , and",
    "@xmath187 is canceled out as shown in section 1 .",
    "this is the reason why @xmath183 has little uncertainty .",
    "@xmath188 is classified into the case 3 in section 1 , and @xmath183 is given by , @xmath189 where its uncertainty from @xmath87 is @xmath190 .",
    "in order to extract the weak phase from the experimental data on cp asymmetries , we have to know the magnitude and strong phase of the penguin contribution .",
    "we have applied pqcd approach to @xmath0 and @xmath1 decay modes , which allows us to compute both the strong phase and magnitude of these amplitudes .",
    "we have calculated the ratios @xmath87 between the penguin and tree amplitude which are crucial in predicting cp asymmetries . for each decay mode ,",
    "uncertainty of @xmath149 is @xmath153 .",
    "the direct cp asymmetry which is proportional to @xmath87 suffers from uncertainty in @xmath149 directly , and the error is estimated at @xmath5 .",
    "however , the mixing induced cp asymmetry for @xmath170 , which is not proportional to @xmath87 , has small uncertainty , and the asymmetry has been predicted with @xmath3 uncertainty . while it is difficult to measure the time dependence of @xmath69 at current @xmath8 factories , we predicted @xmath87 for @xmath191 decay mode .",
    "this leads to the mixing induced cp asymmetry which is related to the weak phase @xmath192 .",
