    "it is now clear that most accretion of mass onto supermassive black holes is obscured from our view ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "observations of nearby active galactic nuclei ( agn ) suggested that the local ratio of obscured to unobscured sources is @xmath04:1 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a similarly high fraction of obscured agn has been used to explain the spectrum and normalization of the extragalactic x - ray background ( xrb ) , as shown by the latest agn population synthesis models @xcite .",
    "the xrb gives an integral constraint to the agn population and its evolution ; the most recent deep surveys show that @xmath090% of the observed 28 kev xrb radiation can be attributed to resolved agn ( @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "the most obscured agn known are those in which the neutral hydrogen column density ( @xmath1 ) in the line of sight is higher than the inverse thomson cross section , @xmath1@xmath21.5@xmath310@xmath4  @xmath5 .",
    "these are the so - called compton - thick ( ct ) agn . if the obscuring column density is smaller than @xmath010@xmath6  @xmath5 , direct emission from the nucleus is still visible at energies greater than @xmath010  kev , while the radiation at lower energies is completely obscured by photoelectric absorption ; in this case we have a transmission - dominated ct agn . for sources with @xmath1@xmath710@xmath6  @xmath5 the x - ray emission is significantly affected by compton scattering at all energies , fully obscuring the direct agn emission and leaving only the much fainter reflection component to be detected ; these are reflection - dominated agn .",
    "contrary to the situation for less obscured sources , not much is known about the number density of ct agn .",
    "thanks to the deep chandra and xmm - newton surveys it is now clear that the fraction of moderately obscured , compton - thin , agn is on average @xmath03/4 of all agn , and is higher at lower luminosities @xcite and higher redshifts @xcite , but there are no comparable constraints on the number of ct agn .",
    "about a dozen ct agn have been identified in the local universe ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in fact , two of the three nearest agn are compton thick ( ngc4945 and the circinus galaxy ; @xcite ) . based on a sample of 49 local seyfert 2 galaxies",
    ", @xcite estimated that @xmath050% of all obscured agn ( @xmath1@xmath710@xmath8  @xmath5 ) are compton thick , and similar estimates were made by @xcite based on much smaller numbers .",
    "however , so far there has been no systematic study of the statistical properties of ct agn with a well - defined selection function .",
    "hence , while it has been hypothesized that ct agn can contribute up to @xmath030% of the xrb @xcite and represent a significant fraction of the cosmic accretion onto supermassive black holes @xcite , this has not been demonstrated .",
    "now , thanks to the wide - area surveys at high energies performed with the integral / ibis @xcite and the swift / burst alert telescope ( bat ; @xcite ) , it is possible to study a well - defined sample of ct agn in the local universe . furthermore , since most of the absorbed energy is re - emitted at mid - ir wavelengths , deep observations with the spitzer observatory can be used to select ct agn candidates at high redshift , @xmath9@xmath02 @xcite , yielding an upper limit to the number density of these sources .    in this paper",
    "we constrain the number density of ct agn in the local universe from high - energy observations , and at high redshift using a combination of x - ray and mid - ir data .",
    "we compare the observed numbers of ct agn with expectations from agn population synthesis models that explain the xrb emission and we study the degeneracies affecting these models .",
    "finally , we compute the implied density of supermassive black holes as a function of redshift , including transmission - dominated ct accretion . when required , we assume a @xmath10cdm cosmology with @xmath11=0.7 , @xmath12=0.3 and @xmath13=0.7 , in agreement with the most recent cosmological observations @xcite .",
    "one of the best ways to find ct agn is by observing at high energies , namely e@xmath710  kev . the hard x - ray spectrum of a ct agn is characterized by at least three components : an absorbed power law with an upper cutoff at @xmath0300  kev ( e.g. , @xcite ) , a compton reflection hump which peaks at @xmath030  kev @xcite and an iron k@xmath14 line at @xmath06.4  kev .",
    "not all components are clearly observed in all agn ( e.g. , @xcite ) , perhaps because of the low signal - to - noise of some of the observations .",
    "one clear advantage of high - energy observations is that photoelectric absorption has minimal effects , so transmission - dominated ct agn can be easily detected .",
    "it is only when the source becomes reflection - dominated that the emission at e@xmath710  kev is affected .",
    "current observations at e@xmath710  kev are available only at relatively high fluxes , and hence low redshifts , @xmath9@xmath150.05 . while bepposax @xcite was successfully used for targeted observations of known seyfert galaxies , it is only now thanks to the international gamma - ray astrophysics laboratory ( integral ; @xcite ) and swift @xcite satellites that large - area surveys at these energies have been done .    using the ibis coded - mask telescope",
    "@xcite , integral surveyed @xmath080% of the sky down to a flux of 5 mcrab in the 17 - 60  kev .",
    "the catalog of @xcite reports the properties of 130 sources detected in these all - sky observations and classified as agn .",
    "a large number of unidentified sources remain in this catalog , 48 , but only seven are found a high galactic latitude ( @xmath16@xmath17@xmath16@xmath75@xmath18 ) , and thus of likely extragalactic origin .",
    "five of the 130 agn are ct agn .",
    "we carried out a very deep survey with integral / ibis , with a total exposure time of @xmath03 msec , in the xmm - large scale survey ( xmm - lss ) region , reaching a flux limit of @xmath03@xmath310@xmath19  erg  @xmath5s@xmath20 in the 20 - 40 kev band ( s. virani in prep . ) .",
    "a total of 15 sources , all agn , are found in this survey , including the prototypical ct agn , ngc 1068 .",
    "we also found another ct agn candidate , not detected in x - rays before .",
    "however , an accurate @xmath1 determination has not been obtained for this source yet , and hence it is not included in our sample .",
    "ngc 1068 was also included in the catalog of @xcite and hence is already in our sample .",
    "recently , @xcite presented a catalog of 103 agn detected in an all - sky survey with the swift / bat telescope .",
    "the 14 sources classified as blazars and bl lac were excluded from our sample .",
    "89 of the remaining agn are at high galactic latitudes , @xmath16@xmath17@xmath16@xmath715@xmath18 , where only one source remains unidentified .",
    "the fraction of unidentified sources is much smaller for swift compared to integral because of follow - up observations with swift s dedicated x - ray telescope . in the @xcite catalog there are five agn with estimated @xmath1 greater than 10@xmath4  @xmath5 .",
    "however , we caution that these @xmath1 measurements were obtained by fitting a single absorbed power - law to the x - ray spectrum , while it is known that heavily absorbed agn have more complex spectra ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we added to our sample the source ngc 7582 , which has @xmath1@xmath010@xmath21  @xmath5 in @xcite but has been shown with xmm / newton data to have a very complex spectrum with strong evidence for mildly compton - thick absorption , @xmath1@xmath010@xmath4  @xmath5 @xcite . with the improved sensitivity of the suzaku telescope @xcite , it is possible to perform detailed x - ray spectroscopy for some of the sources detected by swift / bat included in the catalog of @xcite , revealing in some cases compton - thick absorption .",
    "we added to our sample the source ngc 5728 , which as reported by @xcite from sukazu observations is obscured by a compton - thick gas with @xmath1@xmath22.1@xmath310@xmath4  @xmath5 .",
    "we also added the source eso 005g004 which based on the suzaku observations reported by @xcite is a heavily obscured , ct agn .",
    "in summary , integral and swift found 130 and 103 agn , respectively , in their wide area surveys ; 76 sources ( @xmath058% ) were detected by both surveys .",
    "( this fraction is not larger due to the differences in sky coverage and the non - uniform depth of the observations . )",
    "we then found 15 agn in deep 3 msec integral observations , one of them the ct agn ngc1068 .",
    "integral detected five ct agn , while swift found eight .",
    "however , there is incomplete overlap between the two samples and we note that the disparate energy ranges make direct comparison of fluxes difficult .",
    "the integral - detected ct sources are : ngc4945 , circinus , markarian 3 , ngc3281 and ngc1068 ; the swift / bat ct agn are : ngc4945 , markarian 3 , ngc3281 , ngc7582 , ngc5728 , ngc5252 , ngc6240 and eso 005g004 .",
    "the number of ct agn found by these surveys is surprisingly low , compared to the sample of known ct agn in the local universe . in a study of optically - selected seyfert 2 galaxies with hard x - ray information , @xcite found 16 ct agn in a total of 45 seyfert galaxies , although four were later demonstrated to most likely not be compton thick ( ngc 1386 , ic 3639 , ngc 5005 and ngc 4939 ; @xcite ) . of the remaining 12 ct sources ,",
    "three were detected by chandra and/or xmm , while the rest are mostly reflection - dominated sources , too faint to be detected by either integral or swift even though they are nearby , moderate luminosity agn .",
    "in fact , @xcite recently confirmed the ct nature of ngc 2273 , one of the sources in the @xcite sample , which is however too faint to be detected by integral or swift .",
    "recently , @xcite published a list of 18 ct agn with detections at e@xmath710  kev .",
    "of these , seven were detected by swift and/or integral , while the remaining 11 were studied with pointed bepposax observations , and are typically fainter than the integral / swift detection threshold .",
    "we use all these samples , suitably amended as necessary , to place constraints on the number density of ct agn .",
    "an alternative way to find ct sources is by studying the water maser emission in agn . because large amounts of molecular gas are required to produce the maser amplification , agn with detected water maser emission are in general heavily obscured along the line of sight .",
    "in fact , @xcite recently reported that from a sample of 42 agn known to show water maser emission , 95% have @xmath1@xmath710@xmath21  @xmath5 and 60% are compton - thick .",
    "since these agn were not detected at high energies by either integral or swift we do not include them here ; however , we note that water maser emission appears to be a highly efficient way to identify a large number of heavily obscured sources .",
    "figure  [ logn_s ] shows the cumulative number counts of agn , with ct sources shown separately , as a function of hard x - ray flux . in order to avoid the necessity of specifying a standard spectrum to convert fluxes to different energy bands",
    ", we show the integral and swift sources separately , but note that a good agreement ( within @xmath040% ) in the normalization between the two distributions exist if a standard band conversion is assumed . at these high fluxes the slope of the @xmath22  n-@xmath22  s is euclidean , implying an uniform spatial distribution , as expected given the low redshifts of these sources .",
    "we also compare with the distribution predicted by the agn population synthesis model with which @xcite fit the xrb , and find in general good agreement in slope and normalization .",
    "the @xmath22  n-@xmath22  s relations for the five ct agn detected by integral and the eight sources observed by swift / bat are also consistent with eculidean slopes , with normalizations of 10@xmath23  deg@xmath24 at fluxes of @xmath05@xmath310@xmath25 and @xmath09@xmath310@xmath25 erg  @xmath5s@xmath20 in the integral and swift bands , respectively .",
    "( for a power law spectrum with @xmath26 , for example , @xmath27 for most column densities @xmath28  @xmath5 . ) about twice as many ct agn at low redshifts were reported in the sample of @xcite .",
    "since all these ct agn have detections at high energies , we plot them in fig .",
    "[ logn_s ] . clearly , they fall significantly below the extrapolation of the observed @xmath22  n-@xmath22  s , suggesting high levels of incompleteness in the @xcite sample .",
    "this is not surprising given that these sources do not come from a flux - limited survey but from pointed observations .",
    "a possible source of incompleteness in our sample of ct agn comes from the difficulty in measuring the amount of absorption in these sources , given that they have in general very complex x - ray spectra .",
    "as noted by @xcite , sources that are not well - characterized in x - rays by an absorbed power - law are good candidates to be heavily obscured agn . in their swift / bat sample , a total of 46 sources with complex spectra were reported . of those ,",
    "18 have an optical classification of seyfert 1.5 or lower , and hence it is very unlikely that they are ct agn . considering the very extreme assumption that the remaining 28 sources are all ct agn increases the normalization of the ct agn @xmath22  n-@xmath22  s by only a factor of @xmath02 .",
    "this is because a large fraction of the complex - spectrum sources have fluxes fainter than that of ngc6240 , one of the faintest confirmed ct agn in the swift sample . in any case",
    ", it is important to remark that according to a detailed study by @xcite , while all these complex - spectrum sources are highly obscured , only half a dozen have some evidence of compton - thick column densities .",
    "hence , we conclude that the observed @xmath22  n-@xmath22  s is not affected significantly by this possible source of incompleteness .    for the transmission - dominated agn in our sample (",
    "i.e. , excluding ngc1068 ) , we find volume densities for l@xmath29@xmath710@xmath30  erg  s@xmath20 of 5.5@xmath31@xmath310@xmath32 mpc@xmath33 ; and for l@xmath29@xmath710@xmath34  erg  s@xmath20 of 2.2@xmath35@xmath310@xmath36 mpc@xmath33 . because this is a flux - limited sample , luminosity and redshift are strongly correlated .",
    "for example , a source with x - ray luminosity of 10@xmath30 , 10@xmath34 or 10@xmath37  erg  s@xmath20 can only be detected up to @xmath9@xmath20.005 , 0.015 or 0.045 , respectively .",
    "thus , the source densities inferred here are valid only up to these limiting redshifts , corresponding to distances of @xmath021 , 63 and 190 mpc . also , because there is a significant correlation between luminosity and fraction of obscured sources ( e.g. , @xcite ) , ct agn are found only up to @xmath9=0.024 in this sample , even though unobscured sources have been found by swift / bat up to @xmath9@xmath00.1 .",
    "that is , ct agn preferentially have low luminosities , so they are found mostly at low redshift .",
    "in effect , the flux limit prevents us from detecting the many ct agn at higher redshift .",
    "the derived volume densities for ct agn at @xmath9@xmath20 are fully consistent with the values derived by @xcite from three integral sources only .",
    "taking into account the densities reported here , the number of ct agn relative to the x - ray - selected agn population is 5.3@xmath310@xmath32/2.2@xmath310@xmath23=24% for sources in the l@xmath29=10@xmath38  erg  s@xmath20 range , while for sources with @xmath39=10@xmath40  erg  s@xmath20 this fraction is 2.2@xmath310@xmath36/2.9@xmath310@xmath32=7.5% .",
    "this calculation uses the luminosity function of @xcite .",
    "however , similar numbers are obtained if the @xcite luminosity function is used instead .",
    "hence , the relative fraction of ct agn decreases by about a factor of 3 for an order of magnitude increase in luminosity . for compton - thin sources , according to @xcite , the fraction of obscured sources ( @xmath41  @xmath5 ) decreases from 100% at @xmath39=10@xmath30  erg  s@xmath20 to @xmath060% at l@xmath29=10@xmath34  erg  s@xmath20 , implying a decrease of about a factor of 2 .",
    "therefore , the decrease in the fraction of ct agn is comparable to the decrease in the fraction of obscured compton - thin agn , a reasonable agreement given the statistical errors in our sample .",
    "this is in agreement with the conclusions of @xcite , who found a similar decrease in ct agn with increasing luminosity in their high - redshift ir - selected sample .",
    "a key ingredient in our understanding of the agn population and of the properties of the obscuring material is the distribution of line - of - sight column densities , parametrized in terms of the neutral hydrogen column density , @xmath1 . in fig .",
    "[ nh_dist ] we show the observed @xmath1 distribution for the sources in the swift / bat sample of @xcite obtained from very simple spectral fitting assuming an intrinsic absorbed power - law spectrum ; the distribution from the agn population synthesis models of @xcite , adapted to the flux limit of the swift / bat sample ; the distribution assumed by @xcite ; and the distribution predicted by the galaxy evolution models of @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 distribution observed in the swift sample is relatively flat , before a strong decline at @xmath1@xmath710@xmath4  @xmath5 .",
    "this decline corresponds to a relatively low number of ct agn in this sample , as mentioned before .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath1 distribution used in the xrb population synthesis model of @xcite had roughly the same number of sources with @xmath1 in the 10@xmath21 - 10@xmath4  @xmath5 and 10@xmath4 - 10@xmath6  @xmath5 ranges , because of an incorrect assumption about the normalization of the heao1-a2 x - ray background .",
    "this translates into a discrepancy of a factor of @xmath03 more ct agn assumed by that model than is observed in the bat sample .",
    "a similar unrealistically high number of ct agn was assumed in the work of @xcite .",
    "the relationship between the number of ct agn and the xrb is explored in detail in  3 below .",
    "for relatively unobscured sources , @xmath1@xmath1510@xmath8@xmath5 , the @xcite @xmath1 distribution is significantly different from that observed in the deepest x - ray fields .",
    "for example , for the sources in the chandra deep field north and south , @xcite reported a sharp peak at @xmath1=10@xmath43  @xmath5 and almost no agn in the 10@xmath43 - 10@xmath44  @xmath5 range .",
    "the discrepancy at low values of @xmath1 between the swift / bat and the deep fields samples could be due to the difficulty in measuring low @xmath1 values at higher redshifts , as discussed by e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 distribution in the population synthesis model of @xcite matches well the observed distribution in the chandra deep fields , but has some significant differences with the distribution of @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy however is not relevant for our present work , which focuses on the most obscured agn .      the @xmath1 distribution for agn is predicted by the galaxy evolution models of @xcite .",
    "they assumed that agn are fueled solely by mergers of gas - rich galaxies , and the @xmath1 distribution was derived by integrating the amount of gas along the line of sight for the simulated galaxies .",
    "the resulting distribution peaks at @xmath1@xmath010@xmath45  @xmath5 and declines strongly towards higher column densities , in reasonable agreement with the number of ct sources reported here .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the hopkins et al .",
    "model the obscuring gas is located @xmath0100 - 200 pc from the nucleus .",
    "such a large scale for the obscuration disagrees with observations of a few nearby agn using near - ir interferometry , which show outer radii for the obscuring material of @xmath03 pc for ngc1068 @xcite and @xmath02 pc for the circinus galaxy @xcite , for example .",
    "similarly , the latest torus models predict small scales for the obscuring material , @xmath4610 pc @xcite , although fitting the ir agn spectra does not provide a very strong constraint to the torus size .",
    "further comparisons will provide an interesting test of the hopkins et al .",
    "the fact that a relatively small number of agn with @xmath1@xmath710@xmath4  @xmath5 is observed can be used to constrain the nature of the obscuring material .",
    "this lack of ct agn can be interpreted either in the context of a clumpy torus ( e.g. , @xcite ) or a smooth distribution ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for example , the @xmath1 distribution of @xcite , presented in fig",
    ".  [ nh_dist ] , assumed a smooth torus with a single equatorial column density of 10@xmath6  @xmath5 . to accommodate a smaller number of ct agn",
    "while still matching the observed @xmath1 distribution for compton - thin sources would require a distribution of equatorial densities , in which only a small fraction of the agn reach the ct levels for nearly - equatorial line of sights . in the case of a clumpy torus , the explanation is perhaps more natural ; the small fraction of ct agn implies that only a few sources have a large number of clouds , e.g. , @xmath47 clouds for the models of @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of ct agn at high energies , even for transmission - dominated sources , is often dominated by the compton reflection component ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which has a strong peak at e@xmath030 kev @xcite .",
    "the observed spectrum of the xrb , which we now know is just the integrated emission from previously unresolved agn , also has a peak at about the same energy @xcite .",
    "hence , it was suspected for a long time that ct agn provide a significant contribution to the xrb emission .",
    "in fact , in the early work of @xcite the contribution of ct agn to the xrb is @xmath020% , similar to the value assumed in the population synthesis models of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ; @xcite report a slightly higher contribution of @xmath030% at @xmath020  kev .    because it is very hard to measure the number density of ct agn , even locally ,",
    "agn population synthesis models have assumed it to be a fixed fraction of the obscured , compton - thin sources , typically @xmath00.5 - 1 times as many . in figure  [ frac_ct ]",
    "we show the fraction of all agn that are compton - thick , compared to the observed fraction in the integral and swift samples as a function of hard x - ray flux . at fluxes of @xmath010@xmath25",
    "erg  @xmath5  @xmath20 the fraction of ct agn in the model of @xcite is @xmath015% , while the observed value is @xmath06@xmath485% for integral , and @xmath08@xmath483% for the swift sample . for comparison , in figure  [ frac_ct ] ( solid line )",
    "we show the predicted ct agn fraction as a function of flux for the model of @xcite with the number of ct agn modified to match the integral and swift observations presented here .",
    "the @xcite model assumes a nearly constant fraction of ct agn , while the @xcite model assumes a steep increase in the number of ct agn at fluxes fainter than @xmath010@xmath49  erg  @xmath5  s@xmath20 .",
    "this is due to the assumed luminosity dependence of the fraction of obscured sources in the @xcite model , which decreases steeply above luminosities of @xmath010@xmath34  erg  s@xmath20 and is flat at lower luminosities .",
    "while such faint fluxes are still out of reach for current hard x - ray observatories , it will be possible to test this flux regime with nustar and the international x - ray observatory ( ixo ) .",
    "however , the luminosity dependence of the fraction of obscured agn assumed by the model of @xcite can already be ruled out , in particular at high luminosities , by observations of compton - thin agn at lower energies @xcite .",
    "the fact that the xrb does not constrain the number density of ct agn can be explained by strong degeneracies in other parameters , like the assumed spread in spectral index @xcite , high - energy cutoff , etc . when trying to constrain the number density of ct agn the most important parameter is the normalization of the compton reflection component , which is directly related to the agn luminosity at @xmath030 kev , where the ct agn contribution is maximal .",
    "given that even the nearest agn have only low signal - to - noise observations at e@xmath710  kev , the normalization of the compton reflection component is not well constrained by observations of individual sources . from a sample of 22 seyfert galaxies , excluding ct sources , @xcite concluded that both obscured and unobscured sources have similar reflection components with normalization values in the range r@xmath00.6 - 1 ( in units of 2@xmath50 ) .",
    "a similar value of r@xmath21 was reported by @xcite based on bepposax observations of a sample of 9 seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "although with large scatter , normalizations for the average reflection component of 0.9 for seyfert 1 and 1.5 for seyfert 2 were measured from bepposax observations of a sample of 36 sources @xcite .",
    "early population synthesis models for the xrb assumed values of r=1.29 for unobscured sources and 0.88 for obscured agn @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the models of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite assumed a constant value of r=1 ( equivalent to a solid angle of 2@xmath50 ) for both obscured and unobscured sources .",
    "@xcite assumed the same normalizations as @xcite , r@xmath01.3 and 0.88 ; however , for high - luminosity sources , @xmath39@xmath710@xmath37  erg  s@xmath20 , the reflection component was not included ( r=0 ) .",
    "for a given number of ct agn , the resulting intensity of the xrb at @xmath030  kev is directly linked to the assumed normalization of the reflection component . in figure  [ dens_comp ]",
    "we show the values of the normalization of the compton reflection component and ct agn number density that produce xrb intensities in the 20 - 40  kev region consistent with the latest observed values from integral @xcite and swift @xcite .",
    "this is the energy range in which the contribution of ct agn to the xrb is maximal and hence can be best constrained . for comparison ,",
    "the parameters assumed by the model of @xcite lie in the upper left region of figure  [ dens_comp ] , at a density of ct agn roughly 3@xmath3 higher than the observed value of @xmath02@xmath310@xmath36  mpc@xmath33 and average compton reflection component normalization of @xmath00.6 .",
    "( the latter is a rough estimate , since they assumed @xmath51 for obscured sources at low - luminosities , and @xmath52 at high luminosities . )",
    "the model of @xcite assumed a similarly high number of ct agn and a higher normalization of the compton reflection component , and hence resulted in a higher intensity of the xrb , consistent with the heao-1 @xcite measurements increased by 40% , similar to what was assumed by @xcite and @xcite in order to match the observations of the xrb at lower energies by chandra and xmm .",
    "such a high value of the xrb intensity at e@xmath010 - 50  kev is now ruled out by new integral @xcite , swift @xcite and bepposax @xcite data . given the degeneracies with other model parameters , it is unlikely that the xrb could be used to constrain the average value of r. high signal - to - noise observations of individual sources at e@xmath710  kev are required for this purpose .",
    "since both the number density of ct agn and the normalization of the compton reflection component can now be constrained independently , we can attempt to match the observed spectrum and intensity of the xrb . in figure",
    "[ xrb ] , we show our new fit , which matches the integral and swift observations at e@xmath710  kev , which are @xmath010% higher than the heao-1 normalization .",
    "the original fit of @xcite , which has a factor of @xmath04 more ct agn , is also shown .",
    "not surprisingly , the effects of changing the number of ct agn are most important in the e=10 - 100  kev region .",
    "the new xrb fit matches both the integral and swift / bat observations at e@xmath710  kev and the chandra measurements at lower energies ( which are @xmath030% higher than the heao-1 a2 observations ) .",
    "recently , a new measurement of the xrb intensity at e=1.5 - 7  kev using the swift xrt ( x - ray telescope ) was presented by @xcite .",
    "these new data confirmed that the original heao-1 normalization should be increased by @xmath030% and @xmath010% at low and high energies respectively .",
    "in contrast , the agn population synthesis model of @xcite assumed the original heao-1 intensity at all energies , which translates into a relatively lower contribution from unobscured sources . in order to produce the necessary hard spectrum",
    ", @xcite had to assume a relatively high number of obscured sources at high luminosities , i.e. , an unusual , inverted dependence of the obscured fraction of agn as a function of luminosity @xcite .    assuming a fixed value of the compton reflection component , how much can the number of ct agn change and still match the xrb , given the existing uncertainties in the intensity measurements ?",
    "the integral measurements of the xrb , reported by @xcite , have uncertainties of @xmath05% including both statistic and systematic effects .",
    "similarly , the swift measurements have estimated errors of @xmath03% @xcite .",
    "both measurements are consistent with each other but are @xmath010% higher than the original heao-1 intensity .",
    "translating this @xmath05% uncertainty into an uncertainty in the number of ct agn , we conclude that the total number of ct agn can be changed by a factor of 55% and still be consistent with the current measurements of the xrb .",
    "however , this calculation does not include the uncertainty in the normalization of the compton reflection component , which is by far the dominant factor . for comparison , the statistical errors for the measurement of the ten ct agn detected combining the swift and integral surveys correspond to an uncertainty of @xmath030% @xcite , i.e.",
    ", the direct detection of ct agn is much better than the xrb for determining the number of ct agn .",
    "given that the number of ct agn in the local universe is effectively constrained by the swift and integral surveys , it is now possible to estimate the total contribution of ct agn to the xrb , as well as its redshift dependence . in order to do that , we integrate the total x - ray emission from the ct agn in our population synthesis model and divide it by the observed xrb intensity . to facilitate the comparison with the local sources observed by swift , and to make sure that the effects of absorption are negligible , we perform this integration over the 14 - 195  kev band . in figure",
    "[ frac_ct_red ] we show the resulting redshift dependence of the fractional contribution to the hard xrb radiation . as can be seen , the total contribution of ct agn to the xrb is @xmath09% , and about 50% of it comes from sources at @xmath9@xmath150.7 .",
    "similarly , we conclude that @xmath02% of the xrb is provided by ct agn at @xmath9@xmath71.4 , while ct agn at @xmath9@xmath72 only contribute @xmath531% to the xrb .",
    "conversely , the 5% uncertainty in the absolute measurement of the xrb intensity translates into an uncertainty of a factor of @xmath05 in the number of ct agn at @xmath9@xmath72 .",
    "hence , the number of ct agn at high redshift is largely unconstrained by the xrb .    in figure  [ frac_ct_red ]",
    "we further compare this expected redshift dependence to the integrated fluxes from individually - detected ct agn . at @xmath9@xmath20",
    "we integrate the emission from the eight sources detected by swift / bat . at higher redshifts we use the sample of ct agn candidates detected in x - rays in the chandra deep field south reported by @xcite , which includes 14 reflection - dominated agn and six transmission - dominated agn with @xmath1@xmath710@xmath4  @xmath5 . in the same field , @xcite found a total of 18 ct agn candidates , but only eight of them with a measured @xmath1 greater than 10@xmath4  @xmath5 ; the remaining sources were selected based on their flat x - ray spectra .",
    "all six transmission - dominated ct agn in the sample of @xcite are included in the work of @xcite .",
    "however , no overlap is found between the reflection - dominated ct agn candidates reported by @xcite and the flat - spectrum sources of @xcite .",
    "hence , it is possible that either selection of heavily obscured sources is highly incomplete . in order to compare properly with the local sample , in figure  [ frac_ct_red ]",
    "we show separately the contribution from the transmission - dominated agn and from all sources in the sample of @xcite .",
    "we separated the sample at @xmath9=1.5 , to have the same number of sources in each redshift bin .",
    "as expected , most of the contribution to the xrb comes from the transmission - dominated sources , which are in general brighter in the x - ray band .",
    "the agreement at low redshift is not surprising , since by construction our model was adjusted to match the swift / bat observations .",
    "however , it is very interesting that also for the high redshift sources the calculated contribution of ct agn to the xrb agrees well with the limits from deep surveys .",
    "as shown in the previous section , the number of ct agn at high redshift is largely unconstrained by the xrb or by current hard x - ray surveys .",
    "since a large fraction of the absorbed energy in heavily obscured agn is re - emitted at mid - ir wavelengths , deep spitzer data have been used to find ct agn candidates at @xmath9@xmath542 . @xcite",
    "used the excess in mid - ir luminosity ( compared to uv estimates of star formation rates ) to find obscured agn not individually detected in x - rays .",
    "similarly , @xcite used a combination of red optical - to - near - ir colors and high 24  @xmath55 m luminosity to select ct agn candidates at @xmath9@xmath02 . in both cases , very high source densities have been estimated for mid - ir - selected ct agn , e.g. , @xcite reported a sky density of @xmath03,200  deg@xmath24 , similar to that of all previously known agn at those redshifts in the chandra deep fields .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , very little overlap is found between the two selection methods , implying the possible presence of interlopers .",
    "if these candidates are confirmed , a very large number of ct agn exist at high redshift , considerably larger than the local population .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with the evolution in obscuration detected by @xcite for compton - thin sources .",
    "recently , @xcite reported the confirmation of seven ct agn using optical and mid - ir spectroscopy in the chandra deep field north region , implying a similarly high density for ct agn at high redshift .    in order to quantify the density of ct agn at high redshift , and to compare with local observations and agn luminosity functions , in figure  [ com_dens ] we present the available measurements of the comoving volume density of ct agn candidates as a function of redshift .",
    "our measurement of the density of ct agn at @xmath9=0 is @xmath02.2@xmath310@xmath36 mpc@xmath33 , for sources with @xmath5610@xmath34  erg  s@xmath20 , as shown in  2.1 . at higher redshifts and luminosities ,",
    "we infer the space density from several samples .",
    "five x - ray - selected ct agn candidates were found in the spitzer wide - area infrared extragalactic survey ( swire ; @xcite ) ; these are transmission - dominated ct agn and all of them have intrinsic x - ray luminosities greater than 10@xmath57  erg  s@xmath20 ( magenta open circle , fig .",
    "[ com_dens ] ) .",
    "twenty x - ray - selected ct agn were found by @xcite in the chandra deep field south ; in this case , we separated the sample into two redshift bins and computed the comoving number density separately for sources with @xmath39@xmath710@xmath34 and @xmath39@xmath710@xmath37  erg  s@xmath20 ( squares , fig .",
    "[ com_dens ] ) .",
    "finally , we also show the comoving number density estimated from the mid - ir ct agn candidates in the samples of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the expected comoving number density for ct agn as a function of redshift was computed using the models of @xcite .",
    "briefly , we used the hard ( 2 - 10  kev ) x - ray luminosity function and agn evolution of @xcite , with the @xmath1 distribution and luminosity dependence of the fraction of obscured agn of @xcite .",
    "in addition , we include the evolution of the relative number of obscured sources reported by @xcite .",
    "the normalization of the relative number of ct agn was chosen to match the observed numbers at @xmath9@xmath00 .",
    "this model fits the observed xrb spectral shape and normalization , as shown in figure  [ xrb ] .",
    "the resulting comoving density of ct agn as a function of redshift is shown in figure  [ com_dens ] for sources with @xmath39@xmath710@xmath30 , 10@xmath34 , and 10@xmath37  erg  s@xmath20 .",
    "while the observed density of x - ray - selected ct agn with @xmath39@xmath710@xmath34  erg  s@xmath20 is in pretty good agreement with the expectations at all redshifts , at higher luminosities the observed values are mostly higher than the expectations .",
    "in fact , the comoving density for @xmath39@xmath710@xmath57  erg  s@xmath20 sources from swire is almost two orders of magnitude higher than the expected value .",
    "however , it is important to note that this comoving density is derived from ct agn candidates based on the spectral properties derived from low signal - to - noise observations , and also the number of sources detected is small , so the uncertainties are large .",
    "the values for x - ray - selected ct agn with @xmath39@xmath710@xmath37  erg  s@xmath20 are also higher than expectations , but in this case only by factors of @xmath02 - 3 .",
    "similarly , the densities inferred from mid - ir - selected ct agn are systematically higher than the expected values at all luminosities , typically by one order of magnitude .",
    "this discrepancy between expectations and observations at high redshift can be interpreted in several ways .",
    "one obvious possibility is that the observations at low redshift are missing a significant number of ct agn , which are included in the high - redshift samples .",
    "in fact , we have shown before that the high - energy surveys performed by integral and swift are mostly complete for transmission - dominated sources , but miss a significant fraction of the reflection - dominated agn . while the sample of @xcite includes these sources , it is based on pointed observations and hence it is highly incomplete as well ( fig .",
    "[ logn_s ] ) . also , it is very likely that the high - redshift ir - selected samples include both transmission and reflection - dominated sources .",
    "another possibility is that the high - redshift samples , both x - ray- and mid - ir - selected , include a significant number of interlopers",
    ". these could be either less obscured agn in the case of x - ray selection , or non - active galaxies undergoing significant but dusty star formation , and thus showing high mid - ir luminosities not due to agn activity . finally , it is possible that ct agn follow a different evolution than compton - thin sources .",
    "it is important to note that the ( 1+@xmath9)@xmath58 evolution in the ratio of obscured to unobscured agn found by @xcite for compton - thin sources is already included in the predicted volume densities .",
    "hence , if both the low and high redshift observed samples are not systematically missing a significant number of sources , the excess of ct agn at high redshift implies a different ( stronger ) evolution for these heavily obscured sources than for obscured but compton - thin agn .",
    "because agn are powered by accretion of gas onto a supermassive black hole , the agn luminosity function represents the history of cosmic accretion @xcite .",
    "hence , the agn bolometric luminosity can be converted into a mass accretion rate , assuming an efficiency for the conversion @xmath59=l/@xmath60c@xmath61 ( typically , @xmath59@xmath20.1 ) .",
    "then , the comoving black hole mass density can be written ( following equation 17 of @xcite ) as :    @xmath62    where @xmath63 is the evolving agn luminosity function , bc@xmath64 is the bolometric correction starting from the 2 - 10  kev luminosity , and @xmath65 is the `` @xmath1 function , '' or the fraction of sources at a given luminosity with a given @xmath1 .",
    "for this calculation we used the 2 - 10  kev luminosity function of @xcite and the @xmath1 function with a luminosity dependence described in section 3.2 of @xcite .",
    "the bolometric correction was calculated using the spectral energy distribution of a completely unobscured agn as specified by @xcite , as appropriate for the unified model of agn . additionally , we updated the spectral library with the new relation between x - ray ( at 2  kev ) and uv ( 2500  ) luminosities using the value of the slope of the power - law extrapolation reported by @xcite ,    @xmath66    with these assumptions , the bolometric correction ranges from @xmath025 for @xmath39=10@xmath30  ergs  s@xmath20 to @xmath0100 for @xmath39=10@xmath57  ergs  s@xmath20 , in approximate ( factor of @xmath02 ) agreement with the values assumed by other authors ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in previous works ( e.g. , @xcite ) ,",
    "the agn luminosity function was integrated from @xmath67=0 to @xmath68=@xmath69 , which leads to very large extrapolations in particular at the faint end . in the present case ,",
    "we use the same integration limits used by @xcite in their agn population synthesis model , namely , @xmath67=10@xmath70  ergs  s@xmath20 , @xmath68=10@xmath71  ergs  s@xmath20 , @xmath72=10@xmath43  @xmath5 and @xmath73=10@xmath6  @xmath5 .",
    "the number of ct agn in this model is matched to the integral and swift results , as reported above . with these assumptions , and using the typical value of @xmath59=0.1 , we obtain a value for the local black hole mass density of @xmath74(z=0)=4.5@xmath3 10@xmath75 m@xmath76  mpc@xmath33 .",
    "this calculation agrees well with the values estimated from observations : @xmath74=4.6@xmath77@xmath310@xmath75  m@xmath76mpc@xmath33 @xcite and @xmath74=(3.2 - 5.4)@xmath310@xmath75  m@xmath76mpc@xmath33 @xcite .    in figure  [ bhmass_w_z ] we present the black hole mass density as a function of redshift estimated from our calculation , together with the curves presented by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the main differences with the work of @xcite are in the number of ct agn ( they assumed 4 times more ) , the assumed bolometric correction ( our is @xmath03 times higher at low luminosities ) and the redshift limit of the integration . of these ,",
    "the bolometric correction dominates , such that our derived local black holes mass density is slightly larger , even with the reduced number of ct agn .",
    "note that the bolometric correction of @xcite was obtained from observations of high - luminosity sources only , while our bolometric correction was tested by observations of fainter sources as well @xcite .",
    "a remarkably good agreement is found between our results and the recent work of @xcite .",
    "compared to @xcite , we find twice the local integrated black hole mass density , because they used an optical quasar luminosity function and evolution , which peaks at a higher redshift , @xmath782 , and evolves strongly .",
    "in contrast , the @xcite luminosity function , which includes lower luminosity and obscured sources , peaks at @xmath791.1 . in our calculation , the vast majority of the black hole growth occurs at low redshift ( @xmath050% from @xmath80 to 0 ) , which matches observations of agn detected in x - rays ( e.g , @xcite ) .",
    "the space density of ct agn is consistent with , but can not be constrained by , the observed local black hole mass density . in addition ,",
    "analogous to the weakness of the xrb integral constraint on the number of ct agn , numerous degeneracies with other parameters , like the assumed bolometric correction and efficiency , are important .",
    "even taking into account only the uncertainties in the local black hole mass density , we could still increase the number of ct agn in the local universe by factors of @xmath03 .",
    "hence , we can conclude that direct observations of ct agn at high energies , like the integral and swift observations discussed here , are currently the only way to constrain the population of heavily obscured supermassive black holes .",
    "in this paper we constrain the space density of ct agn in the local universe using the recently - available wide - area surveys at high energies performed by integral / ibis and swift / bat .",
    "a total of ten ct agn at @xmath9@xmath150.03 were found by either integral and/or swift .",
    "these observations are complete for transmission - dominated ct agn , but are probably still missing heavily obscured sources with @xmath1@xmath710@xmath6  @xmath5 .",
    "we find that the space density of local ct agn follow a euclidean distribution with a normalization of @xmath010@xmath23  deg@xmath24 at fluxes of @xmath05@xmath310@xmath25 and @xmath09@xmath310@xmath25  erg  @xmath5s@xmath20 in the 17 - 60  kev and 14 - 195  kev bands , respectively .",
    "this is about 3 - 4 times smaller than the values expected from recent agn population synthesis models that fit the extragalactic xrb @xcite , and thus modifications to those models is required .",
    "we present here a new population synthesis model for the xrb , with the number of ct agn constrained by the integral and swift number counts .",
    "we find that the fraction of agn that are compton thick at @xmath81@xmath010@xmath25  erg  @xmath5s@xmath20 is @xmath05% .",
    "we show that the xrb by itself can not be used to constrain the number of ct agn , mainly due to degeneracies with other parameters , the most important of which is the normalization of the compton reflection component .",
    "we find that the total contribution of ct agn to the xrb is @xmath09% , with only @xmath821% from ct agn at @xmath9@xmath72 .",
    "hence , taking into account the 5% uncertainty in the xrb intensity measurements , the number of ct agn at high redshift is essentially unconstrained by the xrb , even if all the other parameters could be fixed .",
    "we calculate the local black hole mass density inferred from agn activity using soltan s argument @xcite , taking into account the contribution from ct agn estimated in this work . for an accretion efficiency @xmath59@xmath83@xmath84@xmath85",
    ", we find an integrated local black hole mass density of 4.5@xmath3 10@xmath75 m@xmath76  mpc@xmath33 , in excellent agreement with recent estimates based on measured masses of local dormant black holes . considering the current uncertainties in these estimates ,",
    "we conclude that only the direct observations of ct agn such as those discussed in this paper can effectively constrain the number of heavily obscured agn . based on the number density of ct agn presented here ,",
    "our best estimate of the fractional contribution of ct agn to the total accreted black hole mass is @xmath86% .    using a combination of x - ray and mid - ir selection , the space density of ct agn at high redshift is starting to be constrained .",
    "we find that observed densities are systematically higher than expected from the evolving agn luminosity function measured from less obscured sources , assuming @xmath1-independent evolution of the local ct agn population .",
    "this can be explained in three ways , any or all of which could be the case .",
    "first , the local sample might be incomplete , particularly because even hard x - ray selection is biased against reflection - dominated ct agn .",
    "second , the high - redshift samples may be contaminated by strongly star - forming galaxies or other interlopers .",
    "third , ct agn may evolve more strongly than less - absorbed sources , implying a relatively larger number of ct agn in the early universe . to decide this question requires the help of observations with the new generation space - based hard x - ray observatories .",
    "while mid - ir selection of heavily obscured agn is very promising , these samples are inevitably affected by the presence of interlopers , in particular from star - forming galaxies , and by the lack of accurate measurements of the amount of obscuration .",
    "hard x - ray selection provides a cleaner sample of ct agn , since @xmath1 values can be measured directly and there is almost no contamination from star - forming galaxies at these energies .",
    "several different approaches are currently being planned for the next generation of high - energy ( e@xmath710  kev ) missions , to provide a large and complete sample of ct agn up to @xmath9@xmath03 .",

    "similarly , the planned new x - ray telescope ( next ; @xcite ) , scheduled for launch in 2013 will provide imaging and spectroscopy in the 5 - 80 kev energy band with an angular resolution @xmath151.7@xmath88 and a spectral resolution of @xmath01.5 kev .",

    "finally , it is important to note that for @xmath9@xmath02 the chandra and xmm observed energy band of 2 - 10  kev corresponds to a rest - frame energy of @xmath06 - 30  kev , so the effects of obscuration are less important .",
    "unfortunately even the deepest chandra data available now only detect a few photons for the ct agn candidates at @xmath9@xmath02 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , thus preventing detailed spectral fitting that could provide a deeper physical understanding of the nature of these sources .",
