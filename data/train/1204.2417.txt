    "gamma ray bursts ( grb ) are sudden and powerful gamma - ray flashes , occurring at a rate of @xmath1 1 per day in the universe .",
    "the duration of grbs at mev energies ranges from @xmath2 sec to about @xmath3 sec , with long bursts being characterized by a duration @xmath4 seconds . in the past years",
    ", it has been established that some long grbs are associated to supernovae ( sne ) originating from the death of massive stars .",
    "the grbs have been associated with powerful supernovae ib / c having energies in excess of the majority of such sne and for this reason they have been called hypernovae(iwamoto et al . 1998 ; see also paczy@xmath5ski 1998 ) . in particular",
    ", most of the evidence points towards type ic sne ( see woosley & bloom 2006 , hjorth & bloom 2011 ) .",
    "the collapsarmodel proposed to explain long grbs takes into account this phenomenological aspect and proposes a wolf - rayet progenitor which undergoes core collapse , thus producing a rapidly rotating black hole surrounded by an accretion disk which injects energy into the system and thus acts as a central engine(woosley 1993 , macfayden & woosley 1999 , zhang , woosley & macfayden 2003 ) .",
    "however , the collapsar can originate also in massive stars in binary systems , as suggested by several authors ( e.g. baron , 1992 ; kobulnicky & fryer , 2007 ; yoon et al .",
    "detailed galaxy evolution models are able to predict the temporal behaviour of sn rates in galaxies of all morphological types .",
    "therefore , a comparison between theoretical sn ib / c rates and observed grb rates seems appropriate at the present time .",
    "bissaldi et al .",
    "( 2007 ) already attempted such a comparison but the data relative to grbs were much less than at the present time and limited to lower redshifts . at the present time , grbs have been observed up to @xmath6 ( salvaterra et al .",

    "we aim at studying the behaviour of the sn ib / c rate in galaxies and as a function of redshift and compare it with the most recently derived cosmic grb rate . in computing the type",
    "ib / c sn rate in galaxies we will adopt both single wolf - rayet and massive binaries as grb progenitors and we will consider a dependence of the sn ib / c progenitors on the initial stellar metallicity , not considered in any previous similar work ( e.g. bissaldi et al .",
    "our intention is to make predictions for the rates of type ib / c supernovae at various redshift in spiral and irregular galaxies . at the moment",
    ", no observations can constraint such predictions , but in the future new powerful observational devices as the james webb telescope or elt will provide extensive and constraining observational constraints on those rates .",
    "the comparisons with the present predictions will then allow to confirm or reject the present predictions and will bring new clues on the nature of the type ib / c supernovae progenitors and on the star formation histories in spiral and irregular galaxies . from the comparison between observed grb cosmic rate and predicted cosmic sn ib / c rate , we aim first to check whether the present ratio of grb to that of sn ib / c can be well reproduced by our models , second to see how this ratio may change with redshift in the frame of our model . in section 2",
    "we will describe the chemical evolution model adopted to compute the evolution of galaxies of different morphological type , as well as the computation of the sn ib / c rate . in section 3",
    "the computed sn ib / c rates for irregular and spiral galaxies of different masses are presented and compared to the observed rates . in section 4",
    "we assemble different cosmic histories of star formation , including the one computed by means of our galaxy models , to compute the cosmic type i b / c sn rate , then we compare this cosmic sn rate with the cosmic grb rate . finally , in section 5 a discussion and some conclusions are presented .",
    "in order to compute the type ib / c sn rate in galaxies we need to know the galaxy star formation history .",
    "galaxies of different morphological type ( ellipticals , spirals , irregulars ) are characterized by different star formation histories ( see matteucci 2001 ) . in particular , ellipticals should have suffered an intense and short star formation episode , whereas spirals and irregulars should have had milder star formation rates ( sfr ) and are still forming stars now .",
    "irregular galaxies must have suffered the mildest sfr since they contain more gas than galaxies of other types . here , we focuse on irregular and spiral galaxies for the following reasons : i ) because the sne ib / c are observed only in star forming galaxies and ii ) because the observations on the hosts of grbs have revealed that long grbs are associated with faint , blue and often irregular galaxies ( conselice et al .",

    "( 2011 ) , the authors suggest that probably the region high-@xmath7/high mass is populated by the dark grbs .",
    "this idea is partially confirmed by the observations of some dark grb host galaxies provided by kruhler et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , where the mass of the dark grb hosts seem to be higher than the mass of the normal grb hosts .    to do that we use a detailed self - consistent chemical evolution model reproducing the majority of the properties of irregular and spiral galaxies .",
    "the irregular galaxies play an important role in the study of chemical evolution and star formation owing to their simpler structure and lack of evolution compared to spiral galaxies .",
    "we also adopt a relatively simple model for spirals without taking into account gradients along the disk .",
    "we assume that both irregular and spiral galaxies assemble all of their mass by means of a continuous infall of pristine gas .",
    "this is certainly true for spiral disks such as that of the milky way ( see e.g. chiappini et al . 1997 ; 2001 ,",
    "boissier & prantzos 1999 ) .",
    "the basic equations are : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the gas mass in the form of an element i normalized to the present time total luminous infall mass .",

    "finally , @xmath14 and @xmath15 represent the infall and wind rate , respectively .",
    "the sfr ( @xmath16 ) , namely the amount of interstellar gas , expressed in solar masses , turning into stars per unit time , is assumed to be continuous and defined as a schmidt ( 1959 ) law :    @xmath17    where the quantity @xmath18 is the star formation efficiency ( sfe ) , namely the inverse of the typical time - scale for star formation , and is expressed in @xmath19 .",
    "the sfe for spirals is assumed to be higher than in irregulars .",
    "we explored one initial mass functions ( imf ) , in particular the salpeter ( 1955 ) one ( x=1.35 in the mass range 0.1 - 100 @xmath20 ) .",
    "a main assumption of the model for irregulars is the existence of galactic winds triggered by sn explosions . in particular",
    ", it is assumed that a fraction ( @xmath21 ) of the initial blast wave energy of sne is transformed into thermal gas energy and the wind starts when the thermal energy of gas equates the binding energy of gas the wind can be normal .",
    "namely each element is lost at the same rate , or differential , in the sense that some elements ( metals for example ) are preferentially lost ( see bradamante et al .",
    "the galactic wind is likely to occur in these systems because of their relatively low potential well .",
    "moreover , galactic outflows are observed in irregular galaxies ( see e.g. martin , 1999 ; martin et al .",
    "2002 ) . to do",
    "that we follow the method described in bradamante et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and yin et al.(2010 ) ; in particular , the wind rate is assumed to be proportional to the sfr through a free parameter @xmath22 larger than zero : @xmath23 where @xmath13 represents a specific chemical element . to have a preferential loss of metals , as indicated by dynamical models ( e.g. mc low & ferrara , 1999 ) , we use a differential wind in which @xmath24 and @xmath25 for the other elements .    in the case of spirals , the galactic wind is less likely to occur , owing the deep potential well in which the spiral disks lie .",
    "in fact , in spiral disks it is more likely to have galactic fountains rather than galactic winds ( spitoni et al .",
    "2009 ) .    finally , the assumed rate of infall is the same for irregulars and spirals and follows the law :    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is a suitable constant , derived by integrating eq .",
    "( 3 ) over the galactic lifetime , @xmath28 is the abundance by mass of the element @xmath13 in the infalling gas , assumed to be primordial and @xmath29 is the infall timescale .",
    "this timescale is expressed in gyrs and defined as the characteristic time at which half of the total mass of the system has assembled .",
    "the values of @xmath29 are derived as the best ones in order to reproduce the majority of the observational constraints .",
    "this timescale is different for galaxies of different morphological type , being quite short in spheroids and increasing for spirals and irregulars .    in table 1",
    "we show the adopted model parameters for a typical spiral galaxy ( milky way - like ) and for a typical irregular galaxy .",
    "the infall mass @xmath30 is the mass that eventually would be accreted if no galactic wind would occur .",
    "model irr is described by an infall mass of @xmath31 which is one order of magnitude lower than the infall mass of model sp .",
    "the infall timescale for the spiral galaxy is assumed to be 6 gyr , although in the milky way disk the timescale for disk formation should have been shorter in the internal than in the external regions ( inside - out formation , matteucci & franois 1989 ; chiappini et al .",
    "1997 ) ; here we want only to show some averaged properties and 6 gyr is an average timescale between the internal timescales ( @xmath32 gyr ) and the external ones ( @xmath33 gyr ) .",
    "the timescale for the formation of irregulars is assumed to be smaller ( 4 gyr ) .",
    "always in table 1 we report the wind parameter for irregular galaxies ( @xmath34 , eq . 3 ) and",

    "the sfr increases until the energy injected into the ism by stellar winds and sn(ia , ib , and ii ) explosions triggers a galactic wind . at that time , the thermal energy is equivalent to the binding energy of gas , and the gas is lost at a rate proportional to the sfr ( eq.3 ) with a consequent drop of the sfr .",

    "the mass - metallicity relation arises naturally by adopting a smaller sfe in smaller galaxies .",

    "since , these present day properties results from the whole previous evolution , these good correspondence give some confidence that these models can be used to explore the much less well known early phases of these galaxies , which will hopefully be observed in greater details in a near future thanks to more powerful observational devices as the james webb telescope and the elt .",

    "this agreement assesses quantitatively the reliability of the prescriptions that have been used in sections 2 and 3 to derive the snib / c rate as a function of time and provides more weight to the results that will be presented in section 5 .",
    "when the metallicity effect on the minimum wr mass is taken into acount , there is a difference only for irregulars , mainly at early times , due to the slower growth of metallicity in these systems .",
    "it is interesting to compute the ratio of type ib / c sne to grbs ( in the local universe ) and to do that we should compare the theoretical snib / c rates , shown in figure [ snr ] , with the local rate of grbs at the present time ( triangle ) .",
    "the canonicalvalue for the latter quantity ranges between @xmath1 0.5 grb @xmath49 ( schmidt 2001 ) to @xmath1 1 event @xmath50 ( guetta et al .",
    "2005 ) . in order to compare the snib / c and the grb rate in the right units we use the local grb rate of 1.1 event @xmath50 ( guetta et al . 2005 ) taking into account the local density of b luminosity , @xmath51 ( e.g. madau , della valle & panagia 1998 ) and the b luminosity of the milky way , @xmath52 .",
    "this approach gives @xmath53 .",
    "this observedrate has to be re - scaled by using the beaming factor , @xmath54 .",

    "this is an expected result , since not all sne ib / c will end up as long grbs .    in figure [ snr ]",
    "we have shown the grb rate provided by guetta et al .",
    "( 2005 ) in unit of @xmath62 and re - scaled using the beaming factor @xmath63 .",
    "the cosmic sn and grb rates are defined in an unitary comoving volume of the universe .",
    "this definition is necessary to study the rates at high redshift where the morphology of the observed galaxies is not known .",
    "the cosmic rates refer , in fact , to a mixture of galaxies which can be different at every redshift . both the cosmic type ib / c and grb rates depend upon the sfr in galaxies but also on the galaxy and grb luminosity functions .",
    "if these functions do not evolve with redshift then both the sn and grb rates will trace the csfr . on the contrary",
    ", the observed behaviour can be due to the evolution of the luminosity functions of galaxies ( e.g. number density evolution ) .",
    "the csfr has now been measured up to very high redshift ( z@xmath18 ) , especially thanks to galaxies hosting grbs ( see kistler et al .",
    "2009 ) . in figure",
    "[ csfr ] , we show a revised version of the csfr predicted by calura & matteucci ( 2003 ) and obtained by taking into account the evolution of galaxies of different morphological type ( ellipticals , spirals and irregulars ) , as described in the previous sections . in particular , the csfr has been computed by assuming a pure luminosity evolution of galaxies , in other words , the main parameters of the schechter ( 1976 ) galaxy luminosity function have been kept constant with redshift . to compute the csfr we have adopted the following relation : @xmath65,\\ ] ] where @xmath66 identifies a particular galaxy type ( elliptical , spiral , irregular ) and @xmath67 represents the history of star formation in each galaxy , as shown in figure [ figsfrmie ] .",
    "the quantity @xmath68 is the galaxy number density , expressed in units of @xmath69 for each morphological galaxy type and it has been assumed to be constant and equal to the present time one , as derived by marzke et al .",
    "this csfr is therefore obtained by assuming that all galaxies started forming stars at the same time and that there is no number density evolution ; these are very simple assumptions but they can be useful to disentangle the effect of the sfr from that of the luminosity function and to compare these results with predictions from hierarchical galaxy formation models .",
    "this predicted csfr shows a high peak of star formation at very high redshift due to the contribution of the ellipticals which have formed their stars very early .",
    "this predicted high redshift csfr is probably too high and unrealistic since the number density of ellipticals at high redshift could have been overestimated .",
    "in other words , the hypothesis of no number density evolution could be incorrect .",
    "on the other hand , the predicted csfr for redshift @xmath70 seems underestimated relative to the data .",
    "this does not mean that our galactic sf histories are wrong but again it could be due to neglecting the number density evolution of galaxies .",
    "we have adopted also csfrs computed in the framework of the hierarchical clustering galaxy formation scenario , as well as the fit to the observed csfr . in fact , in figure [ csfr ] is also shown the csfr obtained by cole et al .",
    "( 2001 ) best fitting the data collected by hopkins ( 2004 ) from 1995 onwards .",
    "this same parametric form has been used later on by many authors such as hopkins & beacom ( 2006 ) and blanc & greggio ( 2008 ) , since it fits also more recent data up to redshift z=6 .",
    "it is worth noting that also all the other theoretical csfrs shown in figure [ csfr ] are underestimating the csfr at intermediate and low redshifts . to derive observationally",
    "the csfr one should adopt some of the well known tracers of sf , in particular @xmath71 , @xmath72 , uv continuum . in these wavebands the effect of dust can not be neglected and therefore the dust correction is necessary to obtain the correct csfr .",
    "the differences between corrected and uncorrected data are generally large , as shown by strolger et al .",
    "in particular , uncorrected data tend to show a strong decline of the csfr for @xmath73 , whereas the corrected data show an almost constant csfr for @xmath74 .",
    "another important effect in the derivation of the csfr is related to the uncertainty in the faint end of the luminosity function of galaxies .    by means of these different csfrs",
    "we have then computed the cosmic sn ib / c rate shown in figures [ csnr_grb ] where it is reported also the observed cosmic grb rate .",
    "the adopted progenitors for sne ib / c are assumed to be single wr stars with constant minimum mass of @xmath75 plus binary systems , as described in section 2.1 .",
    "as one can see , the theoretical error in the csnr increases towards high and very high redshift and it is roughly a factor of ten at z=6 .",
    "clearly at these high redshifts ( @xmath76 ) the uncertainties are still too large too draw any conclusion . in figure [ csnr_z ]",
    "we show the predicted cosmic type ib / c sn rate obtained by adopting the cole et al .",
    "( 2001 ) csfr and @xmath43 depending on z , all the other assumptions being the same .",
    "here we have considered the cosmic evolution of z , and in particular we assumed the z vs. time evolution typical of an elliptical galaxy of @xmath77 as shown in figure [ evozmwr ] ; this is because by weighting the z vs. time of each galaxy on their number density , the z vs.time relation of the ellipticals dominates at all redshifts .",
    "in fact , spheroids are very likely to be the responsible for the production of the bulk of metals in the universe ( see calura & matteucci 2004 ) . as one can see in figure [ csnr_z ] , the effect of metallicity on the type ib / c sn progenitors is stronger at early times and produces a lower cosmic type ib / c sn rate .",
    "this effect would be similar if applied to all the csfrs of figure [ csfr ] coming back to figure [ csnr_grb ] , a visual inspection of this figure confirms that grbs originating from the explosion of massive stars are only a tiny fraction of sne ib / c class . in particular , the comparison of the snib / c rates with the matsubayashi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) semi - empirical track , suggests the ratio grb / snib / c to be @xmath58 in the local universe and to increase up to @xmath78 all over the redshift range z= 1 @xmath79 8 .",
    "interestingly enough , the grb / sneib / c ratio at z @xmath1 0 nicely reproduces the observedratio between the local grb rate and the snib / c rates obtained by other authors : @xmath80 ( guetta et al .",
    "2005 ) and @xmath81 ( guetta & della valle 2007 ) , respectively . after taking these figures at their face values ,",
    "we conclude that local and low luminositygrbs ( @xmath82 ) barely need the correction for beaming and therefore we can infer that they emit almost isotropically .",

    "then we considered various csfrs as functions of cosmic time , both theoretically and observationally derived , and computed the cosmic type ib / c sn rates expected from the assumptions on type ib / c sn progenitors .",
    "these cosmic type ib / c sn rates were then compared to the observationally derived cosmic grb rate .",
    "our main conclusions can be summarized as follows :    * by taking into account wr progenitors depending on the metallicity and a fraction of massive close binary systems equal to 15% of all massive stars as sn ib / c progenitors , it is possible to reproduce the present observed type ib / c sn rate both in dwarf metal poor irregular and in spiral galaxies .",
    "it is worth noting that the galactic evolution models adopted here are well reproducing the main chemical properties of these galaxies . *",
    "if a dependence on stellar metallicity is assumed for the wr stars , differences arise in the type ib / c sn rates only at early evolutionary times in galaxies .",
    "negligible differences are produced on the predicted local rates .",
    "* we have compared the local observed type ib / c rates in spirals and irregulars with the local grb rate and derived a local ratio grb / sne ibc of @xmath90 .",
    "as expected , only a fraction of these sne gives rise to grbs .",
    "* we took various csfr histories and computed the cosmic type ib / c sn rates .",
    "also in this case we considered both a constant minimum wr mass and a mass varying with metallicity .",
    "the effect of the dependence of @xmath43 on the metallicity is to predict lower cosmic type ib / c sn rates at very high redshift .",
    "we have then compared the cosmic type ib / c sn rates with the cosmic grb rate derived from _ swift _",
    "data and found that the ratio grb / sne ibc @xmath91 .",
    "this confirms previous results that only a small fraction of all sne ib / c gives rise to grbs , but our factor is smaller than what found in bissaldi et al .",
    "the reason for this resides in the fact that we have adopted the recent grb cosmic rate derived from swift data , whereas in bissaldi et al .",
    "( 2007 ) the cosmic grb rate was derived on the basis of semi - empirical estimates ( matsubayashi et al . 2005 ) . on the other hand , if we compare our cosmic sn rates with the matsubayashi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) rate we confirm the results of bissaldi et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , indicating a ratio grb / snib / c rates of @xmath92 . *",
    "studies of grbs and their hosts have revealed to be extremely important to trace galaxy evolution at very high redshifts , although the interpretation of cosmic diagrams is difficult since it involves assumptions on the luminosity function of both galaxies and grbs .",
    "it is interesting to note that salvaterra & chincarini ( 2007 ) pointed out that by adopting the csfr derived by cole et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and assuming a grb luminosity function independent of redshift , one largely underestimates the number of high redshift grbs detected by swift .",
    "this fact could be interpreted in two ways : either the characteristic luminosity of grbs increases with redshift or the csfr at very high redshift is higher than in cole et al .",
    "we have shown that a high csfr can be achieved by means of monolithic like models of ellipticals producing stars at a very high rate and at very high redshift .",
    "however , no firm conclusions can be drawn on the csfr at very high redshift because of the large uncertainties due to dust corrections .",
    "v.g . thanks anah granada , cyril georgy and luca vincoletto for many useful discussions ."
