    "much of the algebraic structure of a coxeter group is determined by the combinatorics of the walls and half - spaces of the associated cayley graph ( or davis complex ) . when investigating rigidity properties of coxeter groups , it is therefore natural to consider the class of coxeter groups whose half - spaces are well - defined up to quasi - isometry . this motivates the following definition .    let @xmath3 be a finitely generated coxeter group .",
