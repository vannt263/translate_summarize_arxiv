    "genome - wide association studies ( gwas ) have been a powerful tool for genetic and biomedical research .",
    "the past decade has witnessed the rapid development of gwas and the substantial contributions it has made [ @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ] . with advances in high - throughput genotyping techniques and modern statistics ,",
    "gwas have been helping investigators understand the genetic basis of many complex traits or diseases , providing valuable clues to the genetic predisposition of common diseases and drug responses [ @xcite ; @xcite ] , among others .    in a typical gwas",
    ", hundreds of thousands of single - nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) are usually genotyped on a cohort being studied to identify important genetic variants that are associated with the trait of interest .",
    "although fast and inexpensive , the collection of genetic information is normally limited to a sample involving hundreds of subjects , which brings statistical challenges for estimating and identifying relevant genetic risk factors . with snps being predictors and phenotypes being the response , single - snp analysis is mostly performed . however , such a single - snp approach is neither efficient nor precise , since it fails to consider all snps and their possible interactions simultaneously , and to adjust the estimated effects accordingly .",
    "therefore , many statistical procedures that consider all snps jointly have been proposed for analyzing the high - dimensional data sets generated by genome - wide association studies .",
    "this is a feature selection problem for high - dimensional data , where the number of snps ( @xmath0 ) is much larger than the number of observations ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "penalized regressions , which are developed to overcome severe drawbacks of traditional variable selection techniques , are widely used to select a subset of important predictors from a large number of potential predictors . in the gwas analysis of case - control studies , @xcite and @xcite applied lasso penalized regression [ @xcite ] and elastic - net penalized regression [ @xcite ] , respectively .",
    "@xcite further conducted a comprehensive study to examine the performance of a variety of penalized regressions in case - control studies .",
    "they concluded that variable selection techniques based on penalized regressions outperform single - snp analysis and stepwise selection . to further explore the potential of high - dimensional statistical models for identifying disease susceptibility genes ,",
    "several two - stage approaches have been proposed for selecting significant main effects . @xcite",
    "employed preconditioning and bayesian lasso on population cohorts to estimate genetic effects of snps on continuous traits .",
    "@xcite developed a gwaselect procedure for case - control cohorts , where several steps of iterative sure independence screening ( isis ) and lasso regression are involved .",
    "these methods based on penalized regressions have demonstrated their statistical power and computational feasibility over the single - snp analysis .",
    "however , since statistical methodologies and computations have already been challenged by the overwhelming number of whole - genome snps , these methods either do not consider gene  gene interactions or estimate interactions among only a small number of selected snps with significant main effects .",
    "however , without considering the full picture of epistatic interactions in gwas analysis , only a limited portion of phenotypic variation can be explained such that potential disease - associated pathways and risk factors can hardly be identified [ @xcite ; @xcite ] .    in light of recent developments in machine learning",
    ", many sophisticated approaches have been proposed to search for whole - genome interactions in genome - wide association studies , most of which are designed for case - control cohorts .",
    "these machine learning approaches include a bayesian partitioning model [ @xcite ] , a snpruler based on an association rule [ @xcite ] and random forest approaches [ @xcite ; @xcite ] .",
    "however , these methods are computationally intensive and do not perform well in practice when the genome - wide snp data are considered [ @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ] .",
    "more recently , adaptive lasso [ @xcite ] and bayesian generalized linear models [ @xcite ] are applied to detect epistatic interactions in case - control cohorts where all snp pairs are exhaustively searched .",
    "@xcite present a comprehensive comparison of the prevailing epistatic interaction detection methods , including snpruler [ @xcite ] , snpharvester [ @xcite ] , screen and clean [ @xcite ] , boost [ @xcite ] and team [ @xcite ] .",
    "they concluded that these methods perform differently in terms of statistical power , false positive rate and computational cost .",
    "however , methods other than screen and clean are specially designed for case - control studies where phenotypic values are binary , and can not be applied to quantitative traits unless the phenotypical values are properly discretized .    in this paper , we propose a statistical framework for detecting whole - genome epistatic interactions in a population cohort where phenotype is continuous .",
    "the framework incorporates the well - developed penalized regressions , which have proved successful in detecting snps with significant main effects .",
    "therefore , existing findings regarding penalized regression theories and their empirical performance in gwas analysis can provide direct and valuable insights into our framework .",
    "moreover , the proposed algorithm is suitable for parallel computing and does not involve computationally demanding techniques on the whole - genome snp data that prevailing interaction models may involve , such as resampling strategies and bayesian analysis . as a result , it is computationally efficient .    specifically , we develop a two - stage sure independence screening ( ts - sis ) procedure before variable selection .",
    "the screening step forms a pool of important snps , which may either have significant main effects or demonstrate no marginal effects but strong epistatic interactions .",
    "since the two - stage screening is based on sure independence screening [ @xcite ] , the computational burden of selecting important interactions is greatly reduced .",
    "more importantly , this procedure guarantees the performance of the following variable selection procedure , in the sense that once important snps and interactions enter the pool , the probability of identifying the correct ones is very high .",
    "we also propose a rates adjusted thresholding estimation ( rate ) approach to determine the number of predictors retained by a variable screening procedure .",
    "this approach is based on soft - thresholding and bootstrapping , and relates the reduced model size to a false positive rate .",
    "@xcite proposed hard - thresholding - based sure independence screening ( sis ) to select promising main genetic effects and interactions for penalized regressions . motivated by the multifactor dimensionality reduction [ mdr",
    "; @xcite ] approach , they proposed dummy coding methods to effectively capture various patterns of interactions in case - control studies .",
    "our approach , however , is more general and suitable for population - based gwas and other variable screening problems .",
    "we applied the newly developed statistical framework to analyze a gwas data set from the framingham heart study , aimed to identify genetic variants that are associated with obesity , blood pressure and heart disease .",
    "we find that , out of 349,985 snps , 23 snps and 24 epistatic interactions have notable effects on the body mass index ( bmi ) . by applying gene - set enrichment analysis tools [ @xcite ; @xcite ] in future studies ,",
    "biological knowledge can be integrated to discover and prioritize signaling pathways implied by detected snps .",
    "morever , snp  snp interactions will provide insight into functional related genes and the structure of genetic pathways , allowing better understanding of complex genetic architecture and cellular processes in a system level .    in section  [ sec2 ]",
    "we introduce the ts - sis procedure that reduces the model dimensionality and identifies potential gene",
    " gene interactions .",
    "section  [ sec3 ] proposes a rates adjusted thresholding estimation ( rate ) approach to determine the number of predictors retained by a general variable screening procedure .",
    "section  [ sec4 ] shows how penalized regression can fit in this framework and gives the estimation procedure for scad penalized regression [ @xcite ] . in section  [ sec5 ]",
    "the statistical properties of this framework are investigated through simulation studies .",
    "section  [ sec6 ] applies this framework to the framingham heart study .",
    "concluding remarks are given in section  [ sec7 ] .",
    "in genome - wide association studies phenotypical measurements are explained by a handful of covariates and a great number of genetic factors represented by snp genotypes . to select important snps and",
    "estimate their genetic effects precisely by adjusting for observed covariates , we employ a gwas model that takes into account the effects of both genetic effects and covariate effects .",
    "moreover , as we discussed , epistatic interactions play a central role in understanding metabolic pathways of complex diseases and traits .",
    "therefore , a comprehensive gwas model incorporating both main genetic effects and gene  gene interactions is more appropriate .    for subject @xmath2 in a population cohort consisting of a total of @xmath1 subjects ,",
    "we describe the observed phenotypic value @xmath3 as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the overall mean , @xmath6 is the number of nongenetic covariates , @xmath0 is the number of snps , @xmath7 is the @xmath8th covariate for subject @xmath9 , which could be either discrete or continuous , @xmath10 is the effect of the @xmath8th covariate , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the additive effect and dominant effect of the @xmath13th snp , respectively , for @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the additive@xmath16additive epistatic effect between the @xmath13th snp and the @xmath17th snp , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are additive@xmath16dominant epistatic effect , dominant@xmath16additive epistatic effect and dominant@xmath16dominant epistatic effect , and @xmath21 is the residual error assumed to follow a @xmath22 distribution . if an effect is nonzero in the regression model ( [ mod1 ] ) , we say that the corresponding covariate or interaction is active . for subject @xmath2 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the indicators of the additive and dominant effects of the @xmath13th snp , respectively , which are defined as @xmath25 therefore , the additive effect @xmath11 in model ( [ e2.1 ] ) measures the change of the average phenotypic value by substituting allele @xmath26 with allele @xmath27 in a population .",
    "dominant effect @xmath12 , on the other hand , represents how the effect of allele @xmath26 is modified by the presence of allele @xmath27 , allowing a more general nonadditive genetic model .",
    "given observed phenotypic traits , genetic information and covariates such as gender or age , our goal is to characterize the genetic control of the phenotype , by selecting active snps and gene  gene interactions and estimating their genetic effects .",
    "however , since in gwas data sets , the number of snps usually far exceeds the number of subjects , it is almost impossible to directly estimate all genetic effects , as even epistatic interactions are not considered in the regression model .",
    "recently , penalized regressions that regularize the size of regression coefficients are applied to gwas models without interactions , and appropriate algorithms are designed for high - dimensional inference , such as cyclical coordinate descent methods .",
    "but in many clinical trials where the number of snps is extremely large compared with the sample size , the empirical performance of penalized regression is not guaranteed .",
    "moreover , if four interaction terms for each snp pair are considered in the gwas analysis , the estimation of all genetic effects in the ultrahigh - dimensional setting is infeasible from the perspective of both statistical theories and computational cost .    to identify this ultrahigh - dimensional model in practice , and to make the best use of gwas data for better explanation and predictions , we need to put assumptions on the heredity structures of epistatic effects , although we want to make the restrictions as weak as possible .",
    "two versions of the effect heredity principle are the following : strong heredity and weak heredity [ @xcite ] . under strong heredity , if the interaction between two predictors is significant , both predictors should be marginally significant . under",
    "weak heredity , only one needs to be marginally significant .",
    "obviously , in prevailing penalized regression models for gwas , where interaction effects are tested after a subset of significant snps are selected , strong heredity assumption is implicitly imposed . however , throughout this paper we will assume only weak heredity , since , in practice , many important snps are marginally uncorrelated with the response , but interact with other snps in an epistasis network . with this biologically meaningful assumption in the epistatic gwas model as well as large data sets collected in genome - wide studies , the potential of gwas could be fully explored , and a detailed picture of genetic control and regulation could be unveiled .",
    "two snps involved in a two - way interaction will be denoted as `` two roots . ''",
    "we will employ a two - stage sure independence screening ( ts - sis ) procedure to identify snps which may have active main effects or may act as roots .",
    "sure independence screening is a statistical learning technique for ultrahigh - dimensional data proposed by @xcite . in the context of gwas analysis , it ranks the importance of snps according to their marginal correlations with the response and retains those snps whose marginal correlations are strong enough .",
    "it can be shown that under some technical conditions , sure independence screening enjoys the sure screening property .",
    "that is , the reduced model is capable of retaining all the active snps with asymptotic probability one .",
    "let @xmath28 and @xmath29 be two sets of indices of truly important additive effects and truly important dominant effects , respectively .",
    "the first sis round will be performed between each snp and the response to select active main effects .",
    "since it is common practice to include covariates as linear predictors of the response in gwas analysis , covariates are not subject to sis and will later be added to the reduced model after ts - sis . after the first stage of sis , two subsets of snps with potential nonzero additive effects @xmath30 and potential nonzero dominant effects @xmath31 are selected .",
    "sure screening property [ @xcite ] implies that truly important main effects are retained in @xmath30 and @xmath31 with high probabilities .",
    "next , we formulate pairwise epistatic interactions between all snps in @xmath30 or @xmath31 and all genome - wide snps . in particular , an additive@xmath32additive interaction term is formulated by taking one snp from @xmath30 and taking any additive effect from all snps .",
    "the set of additive@xmath16additive interactions are denoted by @xmath33 . similarly , additive@xmath16dominant interactions @xmath34 , dominant@xmath16additive interactions @xmath35 , and dominant@xmath16dominant interactions @xmath36 are formulated , and the gwas model becomes @xmath37    after adding interaction terms in the model ( [ mod2 ] ) , the model dimensionality becomes extremely high compared with gwas model without epistatic interactions . to test whether these interactions contribute to the observed variation in phenotypes",
    ", we again apply sis to all interaction terms and select epistatic effects that are highly correlated with the response .",
    "let @xmath38 be the index set for the selected additive@xmath16additive interactions between a snp in @xmath30 and another genome - wide snp .",
    "similarly , we define three other sets , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , which contain selected additive@xmath16dominant , dominant@xmath16additive and dominant@xmath32dominant interactions , respectively . then the gwas model after",
    "ts - sis becomes @xmath42    algorithm  [ alg1 ] summarizes the ts - sis procedure , where the sizes of the reduced models in steps 1  and  3 will be determined by the rate approach proposed in section  [ sec3 ] .",
    "apply the sis approach to all additive and dominate main effects snps and estimate the reduced models @xmath43 and @xmath31 .",
    "formulate pairwise epistatic interactions between all snps selected in @xmath30 or @xmath31 and all genome - wide snps @xmath44 .",
    "that is , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 .",
    "apply the sis approach again to all epistatic interactions in step  2 , that is , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , and obtain the reduced models @xmath51 , @xmath39 , @xmath52  and  @xmath41 . combine all reduced models in steps  1  and  3 to obtain the final selected model by the ts - sis procedure : @xmath53 .",
    "if some nongenetic covariates ( such as age ) are known as truly significant predictors in model ( [ e2.1 ] ) , the following modified independence screening procedure can be implemented to improve the performance in steps  1  and  3 of algorithm  [ alg1 ] .",
    "we run a linear regression of the response on each snp and the significant nongenetic covariates , and utilize the magnitude of the snp s estimated coefficient as a marginal screening utility .",
    "in this section we propose a general rule to determine the size of the reduced model selected by an independence screening procedure .",
    "this rule can be applied to other independence screening methods . in its application to the proposed ts - sis , it is equivalent to determining the cardinalities of sets @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .    in general",
    ", the choice of the reduced model size is critical for any independence screening approach .",
    "if the model size is too large , the following penalized regression would be less efficient due to the presence of too many noise variables .",
    "if the model size is too small , on the other hand , it is likely to miss important predictors in the screening stage .",
    "@xcite suggested the reduced model size being proportional to @xmath56 $ ] for the sis procedure , where @xmath1 is the sample size and  @xmath57 $ ] denotes the integer of a real number .",
    "although this hard thresholding is easy to implement in practice , little theoretical evidence is provided to guarantee its performance in different data sets .",
    "@xcite proposed a soft - thresholding rule by adding auxiliary variables in their sure independent ranking and screening ( sirs ) procedure for multi - index models with ultrahigh - dimensional covariates . in what follows",
    "we propose a general data - driven procedure to determine the reduced model size that extends the soft - thresholding procedure .",
    "denote the @xmath58-dimensional vector of predictors by @xmath59 , and denote the vector of regression coefficients by @xmath60 in a linear regression model .",
    "let @xmath61 be the set of active predictors and @xmath62 be its complement .",
    "that is , @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the idea of the soft - thresholding rule in @xcite is as follows .",
    "first , @xmath65 auxiliary variables are generated independently and randomly @xmath66 .",
    "next , an independence screening procedure is applied to the combined predictors set @xmath67 .",
    "let @xmath68 be the marginal screening utility between each predictor and the response , where @xmath69 .",
    "because @xmath70 is known to be independent of the response , the marginal utility @xmath68 between any @xmath71 and the response is exactly zero and the associated sample version @xmath72 should be less than any marginal utility between the active predictors and the response .",
    "@xcite suggested the maximal sample marginal utility of all auxiliary variables , @xmath73 , as a natural cutoff to separate two sets of active and inactive predictors in @xmath74 .",
    "thus , the selected model is determined by @xmath75 .",
    "although the soft - thresholding procedure may be useful , there are two major concerns of practical interest .",
    "the first is the choice of the number of auxiliary variables @xmath65 .",
    "the larger the @xmath65 value , the sparser the selected model , and thus the higher the probability of missing some active predictors .",
    "besides , a larger @xmath65 value implies more computation cost . on the other hand ,",
    "a smaller @xmath65 value gives a smaller cutoff , thus the reduced model dimensionality could still be very high . the second concern is how to generate independent auxiliary variables @xmath70 .",
    "the performance of the soft - thresholding rule depends on an exchangeability assumption between inactive predictors and auxiliary variables assumed in theorem  3 of @xcite .",
    "but its validity is difficult to check in practice . to address these concerns",
    ", we propose a rates adjusted thresholding estimation ( rate ) approach to determine the number of auxiliary variables @xmath65 by bootstrapping auxiliary variables from the original data .",
    "in particular , we propose to relate the number of auxiliary variables @xmath65 to the false positive rate of an independence screening procedure @xmath76 which is the proportion of inactive predictors that are incorrectly included in the selected model @xmath77 . in data mining and bioinformatics ,",
    "statistical power is also known as sensitivity , and false positive rate is one minus specificity .",
    "both sensitivity and specificity are performance measures of interest in genetic association studies [ see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ] .",
    "the next theorem provides a lower bound on the probability that the false positive rate is controlled under a pre - specified level @xmath78 .",
    "[ teofpr][teo1 ] suppose that the inactive variables @xmath79 and auxiliary variables @xmath80 are exchangeable in the sense that the inactive and auxiliary variables are equally likely to be selected by the independence screening procedure . under the sparsity condition that @xmath81 , the probability that the false positive rate can be controlled under a pre - specified level @xmath78 is bounded from below .",
    "that is , @xmath82    the theorem implies that the probability of the false positive rate being controlled below a given level @xmath78 is greater than @xmath83 .",
    "given a fixed confidence level @xmath84 , the number of auxiliary variables @xmath65 can be determined .",
    "according to theorem [ teofpr ] , we propose the rate procedure in algorithm  [ alg2 ] for a general independence screening method .",
    "[ alg2 ]    solve the equation @xmath85 to obtain @xmath65 , for given @xmath58 , @xmath1 , @xmath78 and @xmath86 .",
    "bootstrap the original data @xmath59 to obtain @xmath65 independent auxiliary variables @xmath87 in the following way . for each @xmath88 , randomly assign one value of @xmath89 to @xmath90 , and then get the vector @xmath91 for @xmath92 . if @xmath93 , one may iterate the above procedure until getting enough auxiliary variables . compute the marginal screening utility @xmath94 between each auxiliary variable @xmath71 and the response , @xmath92 , and set the cutoff @xmath95 . compute the marginal screening utility @xmath96 between each predictor @xmath97 and the response , @xmath98 , and select the reduced model as @xmath99 .",
    "we remark that the modified bootstrapping procedure in step  2 in algorithm  [ alg2 ] is to guarantee the independence between the response and auxiliary variables @xmath70 .",
    "we obtain independent auxiliary variables by bootstrapping the original data instead of simulating them from a normal distribution .",
    "consequently , the bootstrapped auxiliary variables have the same data structure as the original predictors , approximating the exchangeability condition in the soft - thresholding rule .",
    "note that with given @xmath58 and @xmath1 , two rates @xmath78 and @xmath86 together determine the number of auxiliary variables @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , we call this approach the rates adjusted thresholding estimation ( rate ) .",
    "it will be shown later that the rate approach has excellent performance in the simulation studies and the real data analysis .",
    "after two - stage sure independence screening , the dimensionality of the gwas model is greatly reduced . in order to precisely select important snps and epistatic interactions from a pool of candidate , penalized regressions widely used in main - effect analysis could be incorporated here .",
    "specifically , we put penalties on the sizes of additive effects , dominant effects and all epistatic effects and minimize the following penalized least squares : @xmath100\\\\[-8pt]\\nonumber & & \\qquad{}+ \\sum_{(j , j ' ) \\in { \\widehat{\\mathcal{d}}_{ad } } } p_{\\lambda}\\bigl(\\bigl|\\mathcal{i}_{j j'}^{ad}\\bigr|\\bigr ) + \\sum_{(j , j ' ) \\in { \\widehat{\\mathcal{d}}_{da } } } p_{\\lambda}\\bigl(\\bigl|\\mathcal{i}_{j j'}^{da}\\bigr|\\bigr ) + \\sum_{(j , j ' ) \\in { \\widehat{\\mathcal{d}}_{dd } } } p_{\\lambda}\\bigl(\\bigl|\\mathcal{i}_{j j'}^{dd}\\bigr|\\bigr),\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the penalty function @xmath101 is implemented to shrink sufficiently small effects to zero and thus exclude the inactive predictors .",
    "we consider the smoothly clipped absolute deviation ( scad ) penalty function due to its unbiasedness , continuity and sparsity properties [ @xcite ] .",
    "the scad penalty is a nonconvex function and defined as follows : @xmath102 & & { } + \\frac { ( a+1)\\lambda^2}{2}i\\bigl({\\vert}b{\\vert}>a\\lambda\\bigr),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath103 is an indicator function and @xmath104 as suggested in @xcite .",
    "@xmath105 is the tuning parameter which balances the model complexity and forecasting performance .",
    "we follow the idea of @xcite and choose @xmath105 by a bic tuning parameter selector .",
    "commonly - used algorithms for the scad penalized least squares include the local quadratic approximation ( lqa ) algorithm [ @xcite ] , the perturbed lqa [ @xcite ] and the local linear approximation ( lla ) [ @xcite ] algorithm . with the aid of lla",
    ", one may employ the lars algorithm to obtain the scad estimate .",
    "thus , we will use the lla algorithm in this paper . specifically , for a given initial value @xmath106 , the penalty function @xmath107 can be locally approximated by a linear function as @xmath108 with the aid of lla , the estimates of regression coefficients in scad penalized least squares ( [ eqpsl ] ) can be obtained by minimizing @xmath109 after constants are discarded . note that this penalized least squares can be easily minimized based on @xmath110 penalized regression .",
    "in this section we investigate the gwas analysis framework consisting of ts - sis and variable selection through simulation studies .",

    "epistasis , on the other hand , explains 23.0% of the phenotypic variation .",
    "it is worth noting that a few snps and interactions demonstrate stronger genetic effects than others . in other words , although the expression of the bmi trait is determined by many snps , there exist some snps that may be more influential . for example , out of the 23 snps exhibiting significant additive or dominant effects , five have heritabilities greater than 1% .",
    "this number increases to six for epistatic interactions .",
    "additive , additive@xmath16dominant , dominant@xmath16additive and dominant@xmath16dominant interactions are indicated as aa , ad , da and dd , respectively . ]    to depict an overall picture of genetic control for bmi by snp ",
    "snp epistasis , we draw a web of additive@xmath16additive , additive@xmath16dominant , dominant@xmath16additive and dominant@xmath16dominant interactions in figure  [ fig1 ] which shows the genomic distribution of snps that interact with each other . from this figure , we obtain the following interesting results : ( 1 )  epistasis appears to be distributed randomly throughout the genome , although a few snps , such as ss66142093 on chromosome 3 and ss66249128 and ss66468842 on chromosome 7 tend to interact with many other snps .",
    "( 2 ) active epistasis may not be due to interactions between two snps , both of which display active marginal effects .",
    "of the 24 selected pairs , there are two cases in which both snps have active marginal effects and there are 14 cases in which only one snp has an active marginal effect , whereas the counterpart has none .",
    "there are as many as 8 pairs in which no snp is active for its marginal effect .",
    "notably , the dominant@xmath16dominant interaction between snp ss66249128 on chromosome 7 and snp ss66451087 on chromosome 12 can explain 2.29% of the bmi variation , although the latter is marginally uncorrelated with bmi .",
    "in the presence of snp ss66451087 , the dominant genetic effect of snp ss66249128 is dramatically impacted ( table  [ tab7 ] ) .",
    "since our model allows a large number of snps to be analyzed simultaneously , the resulting discoveries should be more biologically relevant and statistically robust than those from traditional single - snp approaches .",
    "for example , snp ss66142093 on chromosome 3 was detected to explain 2.97% heritability .",
    "this snp is near a candidate gene anapc13 involved in pathways for bone and cartilage development that affects human height and stature through cell cycle regulation and mitosis [ @xcite ] .    in other",
    "gwas for bmi [ @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ] , significant snps were repeatedly detected on chromosomes 1 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 7 and 11 in negr1 , etv5 , gnpda2 .",
    "bdnf and mtch2 loci .",
    "our results of main genetic effects are in agreement with previous reports about the presence of common variants near these loci associated with biochemical pathways toward obesity .",
    "the result on epistatic interactions suggests large epistatic effects among chromosomes 3 , 7 and 11 which have not been reported in previous studies , possibly showing the unique power of this new approach . a recent review on identifying genes responsible for type 2 diabetes confirms genomic regions harboring disease susceptibility loci [ @xcite ] .",
    "these regions include two on chromosome 3 and one on each of chromosomes 4 , 6 , 9 and 12 .",
    "we have noticed many snps identified in this study overlap with those detected by previous studies targeting type 2 diabetes , suggesting the underlying correlations between bmi and type 2 diabetes .",
    "additionally , our analysis shows that the regression coefficients for gender and age are @xmath1570.12 and 0.01 , respectively .",
    "that is , after adjusting for these genetic factors , the risk of obesity is higher for females , and the risk increases with age .    to further evaluate the significance and predictability of the proposed method , we randomly partition the original real data set into two parts : the training data set with 900 subjects and the validation data set with the remaining 77 individuals .",
    "we apply the proposed rate assisted ts - sis followed by the scad penalized regression to the training data set , and then use the validation data set to evaluate the estimated model .",
    "denote by @xmath158 the response bmi value of the @xmath2th subject in the validation data set , and @xmath159 the predicted bmi value by the estimated model using the training data set , where @xmath160 .",
    "we compute the following two criteria to evaluate the prediction performance .",
    "first , we calculate the relative mean absolute prediction error ( rmape ) , which is the difference between @xmath158 and @xmath161 divided by the true value of @xmath158 : @xmath162 second , we note that a primary interest of predicting bmi is to predict whether the individual is obese or not , that is , bmi@xmath163 .",
    "thus , we compute the classification accuracy ( ca ) of the validation data set using the estimated model : @xmath164 where @xmath103 is an indicator function . then , we repeat the above validation experiment 10 times .",
    "the average rmape is 14.10% , and the standard deviation of rmape is 0.85% .",
    "the average ca is 82.77% , with a standard deviation of 3.37% .",
    "these results suggest that our model predicts well in the out - of - sample validation data sets .",
    "identifying genetic interaction network is an important task in genome - wide association studies , but is challenged by the sheer volume of genetic data . in this paper",
    "we present a comprehensive gwas model and propose a statistical framework to identify important snps and interactions which jointly explain the observed phenotypes .",
    "specifically , a two - stage sure independence screening procedure ( ts - sis ) is proposed to formulate a candidate pool of snps , including those without weak main effects , but serving as a root in two - way interactions .",
    "this procedure expands the literature by relaxing the restrictive assumption that two roots in an interaction have to be marginally correlated with the response .",
    "a  rate approach is also proposed to determine the number of predictors retained in each stage of ts - sis .",
    "this approach can also be applied to other variable screening problems .",
    "@xcite derived an analytical approach to calculate the power of a model selection strategy in gwas that is similar to the proposed ts - sis .",
    "their approach allows for random genotypes , correlation among test statistics as well as a false - positive control .",
    "it is straightforward to apply their power calculations to our framework . since the ts - sis procedure provided a relatively low - dimensional regression model containing important snps with high probability , existing penalized least squares estimations and their empirical performances in gwas analysis provided valuable guidance for selecting important snps and constructing a gene ",
    "gene interaction network .",
    "the new model has been used to analyze gwas data from the framingham heart study [ @xcite ] , aimed to identify genetic variants that affect cardiovascular diseases and their related traits such as blood pressure and bmi [ @xcite ] .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , this is likely the first study that has detected genetic interactions for obesity - related traits in gwas .",
    "since the detected snps displaying important interactions may be harbored in genes of the bmi - associated metabolic pathways [ @xcite ] , plus higher heritabilities collectively explained by them , our model should provide a powerful and useful tool for understanding the underlying genetic mechanisms and regulatory network of obesity .",
    "for example , dopamine , which is a neurotransmitter , modulates motivation and rewarding properties of eating .",
    "@xcite confirmed by biomedical experiments that brain dopamine levels are significantly lower in the obese individuals , suggesting strong correlations between bmi and genetic regulatory networks .",
    "the use of our model to detect dopamine - associated snps in a gwas study should help to unravel the genetic architecture of obesity .",
    "our statistical procedure is capable of identifying epistatic interactions and enables researchers to decipher a detailed picture of the genetic architecture of human diseases or complex traits .",
    "so far , we have concentrated on detecting interactions for a continuous trait in gwas .",
    "the proposed ts - sis assisted scad regression can be readily extended to case - control cohorts , family trios or survival data analysis in genome - wide association studies .",
    "the framework can also be applied to other statistical problems , where the accurate detection of interactions is desired in the presence of high - dimensional data sets or ultrahigh - dimensional data sets .",
    "proof of theorem [ teofpr ] let any @xmath165 , the set of positive integers . the event @xmath166 represents that at least @xmath167 unimportant variables rank on the top of all auxiliary variables .",
    "because the inactive variables @xmath168 and auxiliary variables @xmath80 are exchangeable , we follow the idea of @xcite and have that @xmath169 @xmath170 by the sparsity principle .",
    "if we can assume @xmath171 , it  follows that @xmath172 where the second inequality follows by ( [ fpr1 ] ) .",
