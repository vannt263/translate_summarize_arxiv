    "in their landmark paper  @xcite , lascoux , leclerc and thibon conjectured that the decomposition matrices of the iwahori - hecke algebras of type  @xmath2 could be computed using the canonical bases of the _ level _ one fock spaces .",
    "ariki  @xcite generalised , and proved , this conjecture for the cyclotomic hecke algebras of arbitrary level in type  @xmath2 . unlike in level one , the canonical bases of higher level fock spaces are quite difficult to compute . building on  @xcite ,",
    "fayers  @xcite gave a more efficient algorithm for computing the canonical bases of the higher level fock spaces .",
    "as a result of his calculations he made a natural conjecture for the maximal degrees of the llt - polynomials , which are certain parabolic kazhdan - lusztig polynomials that are computed by fayers algorithm . this conjecture ,",
    "if true , further improves the efficiency of fayers algorithm .",
    "this paper started as a project to prove fayers conjecture but the machinery that we develop to do this has several other applications .",
    "fayers conjecture is a purely combinatorial statement that gives an upper bound on the degrees of certain polynomials .",
    "as we will show , the representation theoretic significance of his conjecture gives information about the socle of the weyl modules .",
    "to prove fayers conjecture , we take advantage of recent advances by stroppel - webster  @xcite , maksimau  @xcite , brundan - kleshchev  @xcite and the authors  @xcite in the graded representation theory of the cyclotomic hecke and schur algebras to connect the higher level llt - polynomials with the graded decomposition numbers of these algebras .",
    "this machinery allows us to reduce fayers conjecture to understanding the socle of a weyl module .",
    "this paper starts by analysing the endomorphism algebra @xmath3 of a _",
    "schur pair _ @xmath4 , where @xmath2 is a self - injective algebra and @xmath5 is a faithful @xmath2-module . in this very general",
    "setting , which includes the cyclotomic hecke algebras  @xmath6 and the schur algebras  @xmath7 as special cases , we classify the projective - injective @xmath8-modules and show that the modules that can appear in the socle of the projective @xmath8-modules are labelled by the simple @xmath2-modules .",
    "we then proceed to apply this general theory to the cyclotomic hecke algebras and schur algebras .",
    "our main results are :    * we prove that the simple modules appearing in the socle of a weyl modules are indexed by _ kleshchev multipartitions _ ( [ t : deltasocle ] ) .",
    "* we prove fayers conjecture ( [ t : fayers ] ) .",
    "* we give a cyclotomic generalisation of the carter - lusztig theorem  @xcite ( [ t : carterlusztig ] ) .    along the way we prove a number of useful new results about the cyclotomic hecke and schur algebras , such as a new description of the simple @xmath6-modules ( [ l : simplesubmodules ] ) and an interpretation of ringel duality at the level of hecke algebras ( [ t : ringelduality ] ) .",
    "all of the results in this paper apply to what are traditionally called the degenerate and non - degenerate cyclotomic hecke algebras and schur algebras ( but not to the ariki - koike algebras with @xmath9 ) .",
    "this is because , following  @xcite , we use a slightly different presentation ( [ d : hecke ] ) of the cyclotomic hecke algebras that simultaneously captures the degenerate and non - degenerate cyclotomic hecke algebras .",

    "the first author was also supported by the national natural science foundation of china ( no . 11525102 ) .",
    "partly inspired by the extensive literature of schur algebras acting on _ tensor space _ , such as  @xcite , this section studies the endomorphism algebra of a finite dimensional faithful module of a finite dimensional self - injective algebra .",
