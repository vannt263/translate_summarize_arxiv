    "in the past three years , the problem of @xmath0 pair production induced by the collision of two nuclei has attracted a lot of interest , due partly to a series of papers showing that the dirac equation of an electron can be solved exactly in the electromagnetic background field created by the two nuclei , in the limit where the two nuclei are ultra - relativistic @xcite .",
    "this solution was then used to derive an expression for the pair production cross - section .",
    "an unexpected consequence of this formula was that it lead to a pair production cross - section equal to its born value ( given by the diagram in figure [ fig : born ] ) .",
    "in other words , this result seems to indicate that all the corrections due to the multiple exchange of photons ( called `` coulomb corrections '' in the following ) cancel exactly in the total cross - section .",
    "this observation then prompted another series of papers on the same topic , basically saying that this property can not be true .",
    "one of them @xcite re - derived with new methods the classical result of davies , bethe and maximon @xcite about the fragmentation of a photon into a pair , induced by a electromagnetic background field .",
    "then , this result was applied to pair production in nuclear collisions @xcite . in this perturbative calculation",
    ", the coulomb corrections do not cancel and the resummed cross - section is about @xmath1 smaller than the born cross - section at rhic energy .",
    "others claimed the discrepancy to be due to a breakdown of crossing symmetry @xcite .",
    "another paper @xcite attributed the contradiction to a mishandling of ill - defined integrals , and claimed that the result of ivanov et al .",
    "can be recovered from the solution of the dirac equation if a proper regularization is used .",
    "but those papers apparently focused on technical details , without first asking if an agreement between @xcite and @xcite should be expected at all .",
    "in other words , are those two approaches calculating the same physical quantity",
    "? given the fact that one obtains a retarded amplitude by solving the dirac equation , while the perturbative approach calculates a time - ordered amplitude , such an assumption is highly non - trivial , and in fact very unlikely .",
    "in this paper , we re - examine from first principles the problem of pair production by two colliding nuclei .",
    "our main focus is on showing that the two approaches used to study pair production in the peripheral collision of two ultra - relativistic nuclei are in fact calculating different physical quantities . in particular",
    ", we give the relationship between several physical quantities and the appropriate correlators .",
    "the exclusive cross - section of single pair production is related to a time - ordered ( or feynman ) correlator , and is the object usually calculated in perturbation theory . on the other hand",
    ", the inclusive cross - section of pair production can be related to retarded amplitudes , which are the ones accessible by solving the dirac equation with retarded boundary conditions .",
    "therefore , the main discrepancy stems from the fact that the two approaches are calculating different quantities , despite giving them the same name ; and the two approaches do not have to give the same answer .",
    "we then pursue this analysis by studying the retarded and feynman propagators in the background field of two ultra - relativistic nuclei , and show that these two types of propagators have dramatically different perturbative expansions : the retarded propagator can be obtained in closed form in the ultra - relativistic limit , as opposed to the feynman propagator .",
    "we also resolve a puzzle related to the unitarity of the pair production probabilities calculated in perturbation theory , which seems to give probabilities larger than 1 @xcite .",
    "we show that this calculation must include as a corrective factor the vacuum - to - vacuum transition probability , and that this factor precisely restores unitarity .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : after setting up some notations and details about the model in section [ sec : model ] , we recall in section [ sec : reduction ] some relations between observable quantities and various types of correlators .",
    "we also point out some uncommon aspects of the feynman rules that are due to the fact that the background field is non - static .",
    "we study in section [ sec:1-nucleus ] the propagators in the background field of only one nucleus .",
    "this case can be solved exactly in the ultra - relativistic limit , and serves as a starting point for the more complicated case of two nuclei .    in section",
    "[ sec : watson ] , we begin with a formal solution to the problem of two nuclei , which enables one to write both the retarded and feynman propagators in terms of the scattering matrices associated to the individual nuclei . then , we explain why the ultra - relativistic limit simplifies this formula in the case of the retarded propagator , but does not help for the feynman one .    in section [ sec :",
    "unitarity ] , we focus on the problem of the unitarity of the perturbative predictions , and show how it is resolved . we also show that the multiplicity distribution is not exactly poissonian .",
    "section [ sec : approx ] discusses two strategies one can use to get an approximate answer for the feynman propagator , and hence for the pair production amplitude .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conclusions ] is devoted to concluding remarks .",
    "in this paper , we consider two nuclei of electric charge @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively , colliding with an impact parameter @xmath4 .",
    "we study the problem in the frame where the two nuclei have opposite velocities . for the sake of definiteness",
    ", we decide that the nucleus @xmath5 is moving in the positive @xmath6 direction , while the other nucleus is moving in the negative @xmath6 direction .",
    "we denote by @xmath7 and @xmath8 the electromagnetic vector potentials created by those nuclei . because the superposition theorem holds in qed pair production",
    "is therefore complicated by the necessity of first finding the color vector potential due to the two nuclei . ]",
    ", the total vector potential is @xmath9 .    in the ultra - relativistic limit",
    ", we can assume that the two nuclei do not recoil , and simply treat them as a classical background field .",
    "the trajectories of the two nuclei are respectively @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) , @xmath12 , and there is a gauge in which @xmath13 and @xmath14 have the following form @xcite : @xmath15 where @xmath16 .",
    "this choice of gauge makes the following fact obvious : the electromagnetic field of an ultra - relativistic nucleus is confined in its transverse plane due to lorentz contraction . in the ultra - relativistic approximation ,",
    "we neglect any modification of the trajectories of the two nuclei .",
    "therefore , one can see this problem as a field theory for fermions in a classical electromagnetic background field .",
    "an essential property of the field generated by two colliding nuclei is that there is no frame in which it is time - independent ( static ) .",
    "this property has important consequences on the field theory describing fermions in this background ; one of them is that pairs can be created .",
    "however , one should realize that the limit of infinite momentum for the nuclei is only an approximation of the real physical situation .",
    "indeed , the potentials of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ur - potentials ] ) can not be expected to describe the motion of a lepton comoving with one of the nuclei .",
    "this restriction also appears in the work of @xcite . in particular",
    ", @xcite shows that the gauge transformation that leads to eq .",
    "( [ eq : ur - potentials ] ) is well - defined only if the lepton is not comoving with one of the nuclei .",
    "there is another way to see the problem with eq .",
    "( [ eq : ur - potentials ] ) : this background potential is short - ranged in the @xmath6 and @xmath17 directions , while the potential before the gauge transformation was long - ranged .",
    "the absence of interaction at asymptotic times allows the construction of plane - wave asymptotic states , and makes the usual formulation of reduction theory applicable .",
    "but it is also clear that those interactions can not be removed by a gauge transformation for a comoving lepton , the states of which are described by distorted waves . in conclusion , those potentials are valid only if the typical interaction time between the lepton and the nuclei goes like @xmath18 , i.e. for leptons produced in the mid - rapidity region .",
    "in addition , the description of the background field by a delta function is probably not accurate at large transverse distances if the lorentz factor @xmath19 is finite . indeed , at large distances",
    ", the lines of force of the electric field should have some curvature and depart from the transverse plane .",
    "therefore , eq .  ( [ eq : ur - potentials ] ) is expected to break down also at large impact parameter @xmath20 or if the transverse separation between the lepton and a nucleus is large .",
    "this problem is expected to show up via infrared divergences in the transverse momentum integrals . in @xcite , it was argued that those divergences are regularized by an effective cutoff of order @xmath21 .",
    "although this argument can not tell precisely what this cutoff should be , it is obvious from the derivation of the ultra - relativistic limit of the potentials that it is completely determined by the kinematics and is therefore independent of @xmath22 ( the atomic numbers and coupling constants appear only in the numerator of the coulomb potential )",
    ". therefore , the uncertainty in the cutoff can affect only the overall normalization of integrated cross - sections , but not its dependence on atomic numbers .    in view of those caveats",
    ", one should take with a grain of salt the results obtained in this model for completely integrated ( over the pair phase - space and over impact parameter ) cross - sections , because there are regions in such an integral where the above approximation may not be appropriate .",
    "one should realize that due to the large electric charge @xmath23 of a nucleus like gold , the addition of an extra photon connecting the electron line to a nucleus brings a factor @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) , which may be of order @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , we want to include as much as possible of these `` perturbative '' corrections . on the contrary , photons coupling an electron line to itself ( or to another electron line )",
    "yield only a factor of @xmath27 , which is indeed a small correction .",
    "therefore , we also neglect the interactions of the electrons with dynamical photons , and keep only the classical photon background .",
    "the lagrangian density for the electron field @xmath28 is therefore @xmath29 in this model .    in the following ,",
    "we make extensive use of the light - cone coordinates . for any 4-vector @xmath30 , we define : @xmath31 and denote by @xmath32 the transverse part of the 3-vector @xmath33 . with these notations ,",
    "the invariant norm of @xmath30 is @xmath34 , and the scalar product of @xmath35 and @xmath30 is @xmath36 .",
    "the invariant measure @xmath37 becomes @xmath38 .",
    "note also that @xmath39 with the @xmath40 defined above .",
    "in this section , we relate observable quantities to correlation functions of the fermionic field operator .",
    "in fact , these considerations do not depend on the nature of the background field , and rely only on the lagrangian of eq .",
    "( [ eq : lagrangian ] ) .",
    "in particular , the formulae of this section are independent of the ultra - relativistic approximation .",
    "the amplitude to produce one @xmath0 pair is @xmath41 where @xmath42 ( resp .",
    "@xmath43 ) is the operator that creates a positron ( resp .",
    "an electron ) of 3-momentum @xmath44 in the final state . at this stage",
    ", it is very important to carefully distinguish the in- and out- states and operators does not annihilate the in - vacuum : @xmath45 , while @xmath46 .",

    "the important point to note here is that the average value of the time - ordered product is taken between the in- and out- vacua , which are _ different _ states . to expand a little on this ,",
    "let us add that we necessarily have @xmath55 in background fields that can produce pairs , because of unitarity ( see section [ sec : unitarity ] for the role played by @xmath56 in issues related to unitarity ) .",
    "we need to calculate the correlator @xmath58 . from that , eq .  ( [ eq : reduction ] ) tells us how to obtain the pair production amplitude : amputate the external legs of the correlator , take its fourier transform , and insert the result between the appropriate spinors .",
    "the feynman rules to calculate perturbatively this correlator can be obtained by switching to the interaction picture .",
    "the heisenberg field can be expressed in terms of the field in the interaction representation , via the following relation : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the time at which the heisenberg and interaction pictures coincide ( ultimately , we will take @xmath60 to @xmath61 ) , and where the evolution operator @xmath62 is related to the interaction part @xmath63 of the lagrangian by @xmath64 where @xmath65 is an ordering operator along the path connecting @xmath66 to @xmath67 ( ordinary time - ordering if @xmath68 , and reverse time - ordering if @xmath69 ) . using this transformation , and taking @xmath70 ( in this limit , @xmath71 ) , we have @xmath72 noticing that @xmath73 , we have simply : @xmath74 everything being now expressed in terms of in - fields and in - states , the right hand side of the last equation can be evaluated by the standard perturbative expansion of the exponential .",
    "this perturbative expansion has , however , a peculiarity due to the fact that the background field is non - static : the vacuum - vacuum diagrams ( i.e. diagrams without any external legs ) do not cancel , and their sum is not a phase . on the contrary , in a conventional field theory",
    ", @xmath56 is just an irrelevant phase , and one takes advantage of this fact to divide the r.h.s . of the previous equation by @xmath75 .",
    "then , one can show that this denominator cancels ( @xcite , pages 266 - 267 ) order by order the vacuum - vacuum diagrams .",
    "this trick can not be used here due to the fact that @xmath76 is not a phase in the present problem @xcite .",
    "in fact , this is deeply rooted in the property that the background can produce particles .",
    "we can keep this complication aside for a while by just writing : @xmath77 so that the fraction on the right hand side has a perturbative expansion where the vacuum - vacuum diagrams do cancel .",
    "in fact , this fraction is nothing but the feynman propagator @xmath78 on chains of free feynman propagators @xmath79 . in particular ,",
    "the perturbative expansion for the full propagator can be generated by the following lippmann - schwinger equation : @xmath80 note that this equation is equally valid for the feynman and for the retarded propagator ( provided the free propagator @xmath81 is chosen accordingly ) .",
    "this remark will become important later when we also need to study the retarded propagator .",
    "it turns out to be more convenient to work in fourier space .",
    "if we define @xmath82 then the lippmann - schwinger equation becomes @xmath83 with @xmath84 ( and an unspecified @xmath85 prescription depending on whether we are studying the retarded or the feynman propagator ) and @xmath86    if one introduces the interacting part @xmath87 of the feynman propagator by the relation @xmath88 then eqs .",

    "the approach based on solving the dirac equation was motivated by the papers @xcite , where a formula giving the average number of pairs produced per collision is derived in terms of retarded amplitudes only .",
    "we present here a justification of this formula in the field - theoretical framework we are following in this paper .",

    "now that the three intermediate lines are the identity operator on the subspace of states with electric charge @xmath99 , we find : @xmath100 this formula simply tells that in order to count the number of pairs produced if the initial state is the vacuum , it is sufficient to count the number of electrons in the final state .",

    ", one has to introduce a contour @xmath109 going from @xmath61 to @xmath110 just above the real - time axis , and then back from @xmath110 to @xmath61 below the real axis : 1=to 9 cm @xmath111 one can then check that @xmath112 in the previous formula , @xmath113 stands for an ordering of operators along the path @xmath109 , identical to the usual time - ordering @xmath114 on the upper branch of the contour ( and with the convention that points on the lower branch have a `` larger '' time than points on the upper branch ) .",
    "we therefore have formally similar feynman rules for the perturbative expansion of @xmath115 , except that the time integrations at each insertion of the external potential are performed on the contour @xmath109 .",
    "it is customary to write this formalism in matrix form @xcite ( in this section , objects denoted by a boldface letter are @xmath116 matrices ) , by splitting the free propagator in four components according to where @xmath117 and @xmath118 lie on @xmath109 ( upper or lower branch ) : @xmath119 with @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the reverse time - ordering operator .",

    ".      one can also note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : pn ] ) for the probability of producing @xmath93 pairs is not a poisson distribution .",

    "indeed , this drastic ( and a priori not justified ) simplification leads to @xmath322 a poisson distribution of average @xmath323 .",
    "this explains the somewhat confusing statement of @xcite saying that the `` perturbation theory prediction '' for the probability to produce one pair ( i.e. @xmath324 in which one would forget the factor @xmath325 , that is @xmath323 in our notations ) should not be interpreted as a probability ( because it can be larger than @xmath26 ) but instead should be reinterpreted as the average number of pairs produced in a nuclear collision .",
    "modulo the approximation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : pn - approx ] ) , we agree with this statement , except for one thing : @xmath323 is not the perturbation theory prediction for the probability to produce one pair ; perturbation theory applied correctly indicates that this probability is @xmath326 .",
    "in fact , the present analysis makes the following clear : even if @xmath87 ( and hence @xmath327 ) were known exactly , using @xmath323 for the probability to produce one pair would still violate unitarity .",
    "the unitarity problem does not really come from perturbation theory , but from forgetting the contribution of the vacuum - vacuum amplitude .",

    "this is a consequence of the permutations in the final state when squaring the amplitude , which can lead to assign to the same pair is coupled to a background classical source @xmath335 by @xmath336 .",
    "this model is exactly solvable , and the production probability is found to be poissonian ( see @xcite , pages 163 - 170 ) .",
    "it is also possible to understand from this remark why @xcite obtained a poisson distribution .",
    "indeed , this paper modeled @xmath337 pairs as _ elementary _ fields ( quasi - bosons ) , so that the problem of pairings in the final state never shows up . ] the electron of one fermion line and the positron from another fermion line .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig : poisson ] for the case of two pairs , where one can see clearly the origin of the terms @xmath338 and @xmath339 .",
    "one also sees that the term in @xmath339 correlates the emission of the two pairs , and therefore prevents the probability distribution from being poissonian can be calculated exactly , while the individual @xmath92 can not . ] .",
    "this explains the fact that a poisson distribution is obtained only if one neglects the @xmath340 for @xmath321 .",
    "the authors of @xcite attempted to size the departure from a poisson distribution in the magnus model , and found it to be around @xmath341 , which may justify for most practical purposes to calculate only @xmath90 ( which can be calculated exactly according to our analysis ) and plug it in a poisson formula for @xmath92 .",
    "this is the approach followed in @xcite .",
    "@xcite started from the lowest order ( only one photon is exchanged with each nucleus , and @xmath56 is approximated by 1 )",
    "@xmath324 in the background field of two nuclei , `` reinterpreted '' as @xmath90 .",
    "@xcite followed the same approach by starting from the formula given in eq .",
    "( 53 ) of @xcite , which was assumed to be the exact formula for the pair production amplitude .",
    "if this assumption were correct , its square should be the exact probability to produce one pair , and should therefore be smaller than @xmath26 .",
    "this is not the case as noted in @xcite , who `` reinterpreted '' this quantity as the average number of pairs produced in a collision in order to save unitarity .",
    "these authors did not realize that their remark was directly pointing to the result we have proven in our section [ sec : reduction ] : that the retarded solution of the dirac equation does not give the pair production probability , but rather the average number of pairs ( without any need to `` reinterpret '' anything ) .",
    "since the series in eq .",
    "( [ eq : watson - feynman ] ) giving the full feynman propagator can not be summed exactly , one must use approximations in order to simplify it .",
    "we present in this section two different approximation schemes which lead to closed form expressions for the feynman propagator .    the simplest approximations one can think of are truncations of the watson series .",
    "such a simplification is obtained in a natural way if one assumes that only one nucleus has a large electric charge .",
    "if @xmath5 is small enough so that we have @xmath344 then we can neglect most of the corrections in @xmath178 .",
    "since we are interested in pair production , the kinematics requires at least one interaction with the first nucleus ( otherwise , the pair can not be produced on - shell ) .",
    "we are therefore going to keep only terms with at most one insertion of @xmath345 . in that approximation",
    ", @xmath346 is just @xmath347 , and we drop any term with two or more insertions of @xmath346 in the watson series . it is immediate to verify that the only terms left in @xmath282 are @xmath348 this approximation for @xmath282 is in fact the starting point used by @xcite in their approach to the problem of pair production .",
    "the terms that participate to pair production ( i.e. having at least one interaction with each nucleus ) are displayed on figure  [ fig : approx - small - z1 ] .",
    "the term labeled @xmath349 in this figure corresponds to the creation of an on - shell electron and an off - shell positron .",
    "the positron is subsequently put on its mass - shell by an additional interaction . for the process @xmath350 , both the electron and the positron are first created off - shell , and then interact independently to go on - shell .",
    "this approximation , which leads to an analytically tractable expression , suffers however from several limitations .",
    "the obvious one is that for the collision of two nuclei like gold for rhic , the charge of the nuclei is not small enough to justify this approximation , and the inequality ( [ eq : condz ] ) is not satisfied , a term has to be added were the roles of @xmath5 and @xmath181 are exchanged .",
    "the accuracy of the result obtained via this procedure is claimed to be better than the percent level for rhic energies @xcite . ] .",
    "moreover , this approximation leaves out some terms that seem physically important .",
    "in particular , it does not include any term where both the @xmath351 and the @xmath352 in the pair interact with the two nuclei .",
    "such a term would indeed have four scattering matrices .      another way to approximate",
    "the feynman propagator is to start from the definition @xmath353 then , one can use a complete set of states @xmath354 ( @xmath93 counts the number of pairs , other continuous indices like the momenta of the particles have not been written explicitly ) and insert in the previous equation an identical operator constructed as @xmath355 separating the contribution from @xmath356 , we obtain @xmath357 in this formula , @xmath93 can be seen as the number of extra pairs produced ( and then destroyed ) in the course of the evolution of the electron .",
    "another way to simplify the feynman propagator is therefore to truncate the previous sum , and keep only the term obtained with @xmath356 , that is @xmath358    one can note that both the exact feynman propagator @xmath282 and the approximation @xmath359 are solutions of the dirac equation @xmath360 .",
    "their difference is therefore a solution of the homogeneous dirac equation .",
    "it is in fact immediate to verify that all the terms with @xmath361 in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : insert-1 ] ) are solutions of the homogeneous dirac equation .",
    "the calculation of section [ sec : keldysh ] in fact gives the answer for this correlator in terms of retarded and advanced propagators only : we have an exact expression for the fourier transform @xmath362 of @xmath359 , which reads @xmath363\\ ; ,    \\label{eq : approx-++-1}\\ ] ] with @xmath364 given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gt-1 ] ) .",
    "we see that contrary to the exact @xmath365 , this correlator can be written in closed form , in terms of the exactly known @xmath151 and @xmath152 : @xmath366\\ ; ,    \\label{eq : approx-++-2 }    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath176 and @xmath367 are the retarded and advanced scattering matrices in presence of the two nuclei .",
    "each of them can contain up to two of the 1-nucleus scattering matrices @xmath368 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : full - ret ] ) ) .    a common feature of the two expressions eqs .",
    "( [ eq : gt-1 ] ) and ( [ eq : approx-++-1 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : approx-++-2 ] ) for the approximation of @xmath282 by @xmath359 is that they contain terms involving up to four scattering matrices on individual nuclei .",
    "therefore , this approximation contains a little more than the previous one ( based on @xmath369 ) , since it includes a selected subset of the terms of order four in the watson series .",
    "the physical meaning of those terms is the following : an off - shell pair is first created .",
    "then , the electron and the positron independently scatter off each of the two nuclei .",
    "no additional pair is created or annihilated .",
    "these terms are illustrated in figure [ fig : approx2 ] .",
    "in this paper , we have studied various aspects of the problem of pair production in the collision of ultra - relativistic heavy ions , focusing in resolving the discrepancies of the existent literature .    by showing that the inclusive cross - section of pair production is related to retarded amplitudes ,",
    "while the feynman amplitude gives the exclusive cross - section of single pair production , we found that the discrepancy between two methods used to attack the problem of pair production lies at a deeper level than expected : these two methods do not calculate the same physical quantity , and their result should not be compared directly .",
    "then , we have studied the propagator of an electron in the electromagnetic background field created by two colliding nuclei .",
    "it appeared that the exact retarded propagator can be obtained in closed form if the nuclei are ultra - relativistic .",
    "however , such a simplification does not occur for the feynman propagator , which can only be expressed as an infinite series .",
    "this problem arises in any background field that can produce pairs of particles , and can be traced back into the relativistic nature of the wave equation governing the electron field .",
    "this observation indicates that in the collision of two ultra - relativistic nuclei , the inclusive cross - section of pair production can be obtained exactly , but not the more exclusive ones .",
    "experimentally , it would therefore be desirable to measure both types of cross - sections .    within the model of [ sec :",
    "model ] , the inclusive cross - section , which is expressed in terms of the exactly known retarded amplitude , seems to contain coulomb corrections as well .",
    "however , the calculation of completely integrated cross - sections is questionable in this model .",
    "indeed , the problem raised by lee and milstein occurs at zero momentum transfer ( or at infinite impact parameter ) , precisely where the model is expected to break down .",
    "in particular , any infrared cutoff on the momentum transfer , coming either from an improved theoretical model or from experimental cuts , could drastically reduce these corrections .",
    "we have also analyzed the unitarity puzzle , and shown that pair production probabilities satisfy all requirements of unitarity if the factor @xmath165 is correctly taken into account . in addition , since everything depends on the 2-point feynman green s function , unitarity is preserved if one starts from an approximation of this propagator .",
    "a side product of this analysis is that the multiplicity distribution is not poissonian .    finally , in addition to the approximation @xmath370 used in @xcite , we have presented a completely different approximation for @xmath342 that leads also to closed expressions , and seems to contain more of the relevant physics for pair production by two heavy nuclei .",
