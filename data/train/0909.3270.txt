    "primordial , or big bang , nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) provides a key probe of the physics and early evolution of the universe , as do observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation .",
    "these probes offer windows on the early universe at two widely separated epochs : bbn when the universe was only @xmath3 minutes old and the cmb some 400 thousand years later .",
    "bbn and the cmb provide complementary tests of the consistency of the standard , hot big bang cosmology and offer observational tests of its quantitative predictions .",

    "* simha & steigman ( 2008 ) ) .",
    "the standard models of cosmology , and of standard , big bang nucleosynthesis ( sbbn ) , employ the general theory of relativity ( gr ) to describe an expanding universe , filled with radiation ( including three flavors of light neutrinos ) and matter ( including non - baryonic dark matter ) . for our purposes here , the presence or not of dark energy is irrelevant since dark energy ( or a cosmological constant ) plays no role in the physics of the early universe which concerns us here . for bbn , the relic abundances of d , he , he , and li are predicted as a function of two cosmological parameters : the baryon density parameter @xmath4 and the expansion rate parameter @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the standard model value of the hubble parameter and @xmath7 allows for a large class of non - standard models of particle physics and/or cosmology . for sbbn it is assumed that the hubble parameter assumes its standard model value ( @xmath8 ) , so that the relic abundances depend on only one cosmological parameter , @xmath4 .    here , to assess the current status of the standard models of particle physics and cosmology , we ll ask if the bbn - predicted and observationally inferred relic abundances of the light nuclides agree and , if the bbn - determined values of @xmath4 and @xmath6 are consistent with the values inferred from independent ( non - bbn ) cosmological observations , including those of the cmb and of the large scale structure ( lss ) observed in the universe .",
    "in the relatively late , early universe , at the time of bbn ( and later ) , the only baryons present are the nucleons , the neutrons and protons . hence ,",
    " baryons \" and  nucleons \" will be used interchangeably .",
    "as the universe expands , all densities decrease so , to define a parameter which provides a measure of the baryon / nucleon abundance , it is convenient ( and conventional ) to compare the baryon number density to the number density of cmb photons : @xmath9 .",
    "since @xmath4 is very small , it is convenient to introduce @xmath10 . in terms of the baryon density parameter , the baryon _ mass _",
    "density parameter @xmath11 may be written as @xmath12 , where the present value of the hubble parameter is @xmath13  km  s@xmath14  mpc@xmath14 ( @xcite ) .    the annihilation of relic electron - positron pairs in the early universe , when @xmath15 , produces  extra \" photons which are thermalized and become part of the cmb observed today . since bbn occurs",
    "after @xmath16 annihilation is complete and , since baryons are conserved , the numbers of baryons and cmb photons in every comoving volume in the universe are ( should be ) unchanged from bbn to recombination to the present epoch ( n@xmath17n@xmath18  constant ) . as a result",
    ", the value of @xmath4 inferred from the comparison of the bbn predictions with the abundance observations should agree with the value inferred from the cmb ( supplemented by observations of lss ) .",
    "for the standard cosmology the expansion rate ( the hubble parameter ) during the early evolution of the universe is determined solely by the mass / energy density of the universe : @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is newton s gravitational constant and @xmath21 is the energy density which , during the early evolution of the universe , is dominated by  radiation \" ( e.g. , massless or relativistic particles ) .    in the presence of non - standard physics and/or cosmology ( modifications to gr or , to the standard model particle content leading to @xmath22 ) , s^2 = ( h/h)^2 = g/g1 + 7_/43 , where _ (  - ) /_.",
    "@xmath23  parameterizes any difference from the standard model , early universe predicted energy density , normalized to the contribution from one additional light neutrino . for sbbn , n@xmath24 and @xmath8 ( @xmath23  = 0 ) .",
    "however , since any departures from the standard models may arise from new particle physics and/or new cosmology , @xmath23  does not necessarily count additional flavors of neutrinos and , indeed , @xmath25  may be @xmath26 or @xmath27 ( i.e. , @xmath28 or @xmath29 ) .",
    "@xmath25  ( or @xmath23 ) is simply a convenient way to parameterize a non - standard , early universe expansion rate .",
    "for example , if the particle content of the standard model of particle physics ( @xmath30 ) is adopted , g/g = 1 + 7_/43 , the bbn or cmb determined values of @xmath25  can constrain any deviations between the early universe magnitude of newton s constant and the value measured terrestrially today .",
    "[ sbbn ]    for standard bbn ( sbbn ) the relic abundances of the light nuclides produced during primordial nucleosynthesis depend only on the baryon density parameter @xmath4 . over a limited range in @xmath31 , the sbbn - predicted abundances ( @xcite )",
    "depend on the baryon density parameter as , ( d / h)@xmath32 , ( he / h)@xmath33 , and ( li / h)@xmath34 . a good fit to the sbbn - predicted he mass fraction is  @xmath35 .",
    "the sbbn - predicted relic abundances of d and li are most sensitive to the baryon density parameter , while those of he and he are less ( for the latter , much less ) sensitive to @xmath4 .    [ bbn ]    for non - standard bbn ( @xmath7 , @xmath25  @xmath36 ) , it is the primoridal abundance of he which provides the most sensitive probe . according to @xcite , for @xmath37 ( @xmath38  n@xmath39 ) and @xmath40 , ( d / h)@xmath41 , where @xmath42 and ( li / h)@xmath43 , where @xmath44 .",

    "one key reason is that the post - bbn evolution of deuterium is simple : as gas is cycled through stars , deuterium is destroyed . as a result ,",
    "the deuterium abundance measured anywhere in the universe , at any time during its evolution , provides a * lower limit * to the primordial d abundance .",
    "in particular , if the d abundance is measured in high - redshift , low - metallicity systems where post - bbn stellar synthesis has been minimal , the observed abundances should approach the primordial value (  deuterium plateau \" : as @xmath51 , ( d / h)@xmath52  ( d / h)@xmath53 ) .",

    ". that s the good news .",
    "the bad news is that high precision , high spectral resolution observations of d at high - redshifts and low - metallicities ( e.g. , in high@xmath58 , low@xmath59 qso absorption line systems ( qsoals ; see , e.g. , @xcite and earlier reference therein ) are difficult , requiring significant observing time on large telescopes , equipped with high resolution spectrographs . as a result ,",
    "as shown in figure [ dvsh ] , at present there are only seven , relatively reliable d abundance determinations .",

    "the best that can be done at present is to adopt the mean d abundance but to inflate the error in the mean in an attempt to account for the unexpectedly large dispersion among the d abundances ( @xcite ) .",

    "for comparison , if the @xcite value were adopted , a slightly lower ( but consistent ) value , @xmath71 or , @xmath72 , would be found .",

    "having found agreement between @xmath4(bbn ) and @xmath79(cmb / lss ) , we still need to test the consistency of sbbn .",
    "that is , do the abundances of the other light nuclides ( he , he , li ) predicted by sbbn , using the d - determined value of @xmath4 , agree with their observationally inferred primordial abundances ?",

    "where is the spite plateau ? the data in figure  [ 7li ] ( see , also , the contributions to these proceedings by sbordone  and melendez ) fail to reveal clear evidence for a plateau as [ fe / h ] @xmath85 .",
    "even more disturbing is the fact that * none * of the lithium abundances inferred from these observations of the oldest , most metal - poor , most nearly primordial stars in the galaxy , come even close to the sbbn - predicted abundance .",
