    "after the discovery of the higgs boson at the lhc , the standard model ( sm ) has been established well . however the sm still has to be extended in order to explain the existence of dark matter ( dm ) , the small neutrino masses , the baryon asymmetry in the universe and so on .",

    "we define the parameter @xmath183 as the amplitude of the @xmath182 asymmetry .",
    "the dominant contribution for the @xmath182 asymmetry comes from the interference between the tree diagram and the one - loop self - energy diagram as depicted in the upper line in fig .",
    "[ fig : scattering ] and its formula is given by @xmath184 where @xmath185 and @xmath186 are the mass and the decay rate of @xmath177 @xmath187 respectively .",
    "from this equation , the maximum enhancement is caused when @xmath188 . in this model",
    ", we can take a larger @xmath189 compared to that of the second lightest right - handed neutrino in the canonical resonant leptogenesis at tev scale , since the yukawa couplings can be large without conflicting with the observed neutrino masses due to the loop suppression .",
    "thus , the required magnitude of the degeneracy of the majorana fermion mass can be quite milder to generate the sufficient baryon number asymmetry than those in the usual resonant leptogenesis at tev scale @xcite .",
    "one may think that the baryon asymmetry should be correlated with the vev of the singlet scalar @xmath8 since the @xmath20 breaking occurs with only @xmath95 .",
    "indeed this @xmath20 breaking effect is included in the total mass matrix of @xmath171 , @xmath172 and the active neutrinos @xmath190 .",
    "for example , the @xmath20 violating dirac mass term between @xmath190 and @xmath191 is induced at one - loop level as can be seen from the left diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : linear - seesaw ] .",
    "thus the effect of the @xmath20 breaking is included in the masses of @xmath171 and @xmath172 , and one can understand that the baryon asymmetry is generated through the breaking effect in the mass matrix .",
    "we need to take into account washout effects to evaluate the baryon number asymmetry .",
    "the generated lepton number asymmetry could be washed out through the lepton number violating 2 - 2 scattering processes and the inverse decay of @xmath177 . however ,",
    "if the relevant yukawa couplings are small enough , these processes can be nearly decoupled before the temperature of the thermal plasma decreases to @xmath192 .",
    "thus , the washout of the generated lepton number asymmetry is expected to be suppressed sufficiently in this period . in order to examine this",
    "quantitatively , we numerically solve the coupled boltzmann equations for the number density of @xmath193 and the lepton number asymmetry .",
    "we introduce the number density of @xmath164 , @xmath165 and the lepton number asymmetry in the comoving volume as @xmath194 , @xmath195 and @xmath196 respectively , by using the entropy density @xmath197 and the number densities which are expressed by @xmath198 , @xmath199 and @xmath200 .",

    "this panel shows that the reaction rates of the inverse decay process and the lepton number - violating process induced by the s - channel @xmath177 exchange are quite large for a long time .",
    "thus the baryon number asymmetry can not be generated quickly until rather a late period .",
    "after @xmath245 , the generated baryon number asymmetry gradually increases and then the required value can be realized .",
