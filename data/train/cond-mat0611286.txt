    "the bose - einstein condensate in a linear periodic potential attracts a great attention for last years .",
    "many fascinating phenomena like josephson oscillations , macroscopic quantum tunnelling and localization , gap solitons etc have been predicted and observed in the experiments @xcite .",
    "the description of these phenomena is based on the gross - pitaevskii equation governing the condensate wave function and having terms corresponding to the external linear ( varying in space and time ) potential and a mean field nonlinearity(taking into account many body effects ) .",
    "the strength of the mean field nonlinearity is proportional to the atomic scattering length .",
    "we can imagine the bec system , when the strength of two body interaction is varying in space@xcite . for a periodic variation of scattering length it leads to appearance of a nonlinear periodic potential .",
    "the ground state and dynamics of localized states of bec under action of the nonlinear periodic potential have been studied recently in papers @xcite .",
    "periodic potential in bec@xcite can be generated by optical methods .",
    "two types of optical lattices are considered : a linear periodic potential induced by the standing laser field @xcite and a nonlinear optical lattice produced by two counter propagating laser beams with parameters near the optically induced feshbach resonance ( fr ) @xcite .",
    "periodic variation of the laser field intensity in space by proper choice of the resonance detuning can lead to the spatial dependence of the scattering length @xcite .",
    "then the nonlinear term in the gp equation becomes periodically modulated in space , leading to the generation of nonlinear optical lattice .    in real physical situations",
    "exact resonance condition is not attained and the potential represents the mixture of linear and nonlinear optical lattices .",
    "this type of periodic potential also can be produced by two pairs of counter propagating laser beams , when one pair produces linear optical lattice , and second pair - a nonlinear one .",
    "another interesting system where the superposition of linear and nonlinear periodic potentials can be realized is the array of fermion - boson mixtures@xcite .",
    "gap solitons(gs ) in a photorefractive crystal , considered recently in @xcite , also originate from the jointly acting linear and nonlinear periodic potentials .",
    "but the last system is different from ones considered here , since its nonlinearity has saturable nature .",
    "two types of optical lattices can be distinguished : a shallow and a deep .",
    "the first type is realized for @xmath0 , and the second one for @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the strength of the periodic potential and @xmath3 is the recoil energy , @xmath4 is the laser beam wavenumber .    in the case of a shallow optical lattice ( that will be considered in this work )",
    "we can apply a coupled mode approach .",
    "the coupled - mode theory describes general properties of gap solitons , taking into account interaction of counter propagating waves .",
    "analytical solutions have been found for the case of the kerr nonlinearity in @xcite . in our case",
    "the system of coupled - mode theory has more complicated character and is analogous to the studied in the nonlinear optics for a deep bragg grating case@xcite and a nonlinear layered structures@xcite . in the case of vanishing nonlinear lattice a periodic potential transforms into the standard linear one @xcite .",
    "we study the modulational instability(mi ) of nonlinear plane waves which is important mechanism for the soliton and solitonic pattern generation .",
    "the gap soliton solutions of this modified coupled mode system are obtained and their stability is analyzed . the emphasis is also given to the travelling gap soliton ( gs ) solutions .",
    "we obtain solutions for moving gs and study collisions between solitons having an inelastic character . in optics",
    "they have been experimentally observed in fibers with bragg grating@xcite .",
    "it will be interesting to observe the travelling gs in bec with linear and nonlinear optical lattices .",
    "the case of deep optical lattice can be investigated in the framework of the tight - binding approximation .",
    "the gp equation then transforms into the modified discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) with a nonlocal nonlinearity@xcite .",
