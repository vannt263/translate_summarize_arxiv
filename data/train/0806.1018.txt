    "hawking radiation @xcite is a phenomenon that emerges when one combines classical general relativity with quantum fields in a black hole background .",
    "it is thus a semiclassical phenomenon .",
    "the radiation is thermal and emitted at a given temperature @xmath7 which depends on the black hole parameters .",
    "when this is linked to other black hole properties one finds that black holes indeed have entropy @xmath8 and allow a thermodynamical description @xcite .",
    "one can also get the thermodynamic properties of a black hole through a path integral approach to quantum gravity . in this approach",
    "one uses feynman s idea that the amplitude @xmath9 to go to a bra vector state @xmath10 , with metric @xmath11 on a spatial hypersurface @xmath12 at some generic prescribed time @xmath13 , from one ket vector state , @xmath14 , with metric @xmath15 on a spatial hypersurface @xmath16 at some generic prescribed time @xmath17 , can be found from the sum of all possible classical vacuum geometries , i.e. , metric field configurations @xmath18 , which take the prescribed values @xmath15 and @xmath11 on the surfaces @xmath16 and @xmath12 , respectively , i.e. , @xmath19\\,\\exp\\left(is[g]\\right)$ ] , where @xmath20 $ ] is a measure on the space of all the gravitational field configurations , and @xmath8 is the lorentzian action of the theory .",
    "now , it is known that if one euclideanizes the prescribed time @xmath21 such that @xmath22 and euclideanizes the action @xmath23 , one obtains a timeless amplitude , which is equivalent to the partition function @xmath24\\,\\exp\\left(-s[g]\\right)$ ] . the partition function",
    "is then computed in the saddle point approximation , which finally connects to thermodynamics through the relation between @xmath25 and the helmholtz free energy @xmath26 , i.e. , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the temperature , and we put boltzmann s constant @xmath29 .",
    "since one has computed the partition function @xmath25 in this formalism one is working , a priori , in a well defined canonical ensemble , where the temperature @xmath30 is given .",
    "however , solitary black holes are unstable against thermal fluctuations , indeed the heat capacity is in general negative .",
    "this means that the canonical ensemble is not defined at all and one should work instead in a microcanonical ensemble @xcite . in the microcanonical ensemble the total energy @xmath31 of the system , rather than the temperature @xmath30 ,",
    "is given , and the ensemble is usually well defined . on the other hand , calculations in the canonical ensemble",
    "are much easier than in the microcanonical .",
    "thus , in order to stick to the canonical ensemble in a coherent fashion , one has to go beyond a solitary black hole , by enclosing it in an appropriate finite box . in this way",
    ", the path integral formalism and its inherent connection to the canonical ensemble , makes sense , if one carefully chooses the boundary conditions by fixing the local temperature at the surface of the box itself , as was done for the schwarzschild case in @xcite , and generalized to an arbitrary static field in @xcite .",
    "this can also be naturally extended to the grand canonical ensemble when one includes charge @xcite .",
    "if further , one puts a cosmological constant into the system , i.e. , one deals with an asymptotic anti - de sitter spacetime , one can dispense with the box , since the cosmological constant itself yields a natural box @xcite .",
    "this approach , called the brown - york formalism , has been further used a number of times in various different dimensions and for several different theories of gravity containing black holes .",
    "one should note that since the entropy and the other laws of black hole thermodynamics can be derived without considering matter fields , one finds that the black hole entropy is really an intrinsic entropy pertaining to the black hole geometry itself .",
    "there are many other approaches to calculate the entropy and the thermodynamics of a black hole .",
    "the route we want to follow , motivated by the success of the path integral approach , is to build a lorentzian hamiltonian classical theory of the gravity in question , and then obtain a lorentzian time evolution operator in the schrdinger picture .",
    "afterward one performs a wick rotation from real to imaginary time , in order to find a well defined partition function . in more detail , the prescription implicit in this approach is : find the hamiltonian of the system , calculate then the time evolution between a final state and an initial state , i.e. , between the bra and ket vectors of those states , @xmath10 and @xmath14 , and then euclideanize time . here , the amplitude to propagate to a configuration @xmath10 from a configuration @xmath14 , is represented by @xmath32 in the schrdinger picture .",
    "euclideanizing time , @xmath33 and summing over a complete orthonormal basis of configurations @xmath34 one obtains the partition function @xmath35 , of the field @xmath18 at a temperature @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the eigenenergy of the eigenstate @xmath34 .",
    "this route is based on the hamiltonian methods of @xcite .",
    "it was developed by louko and whiting in @xcite for the specific problem of finding black hole entropies and thermodynamic properties , and further applied in @xcite by louko and collaborators , in @xcite by bose and collaborators , and in @xcite by kunstatter and collaborators .",
    "this approach also points to an entropy where the degrees of freedom are in the gravitational field itself , since nowhere one mentions matter fields .",
    "the louko - whiting method @xcite relies heavily on the hamiltonian approach of @xcite , which in turn is an important ramification of the arnowitt , deser , and misner approach , the adm approach @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , when applied to the full vacuum schwarzschild black hole spacetime .",
    "this spacetime is better described by a spherically symmetric white hole plus black hole plus two asymptotically flat regions .",
    "these regions are well pictured in a kruskal , or perhaps better , in a carter - penrose diagram .",
    "indeed , kucha @xcite in studying within this formalism the schwarzschild black hole found the true dynamical degree of freedom of the phase space of such a spacetime , by considering the spacelike foliations of the full manifold .",
    "this degree of freedom is represented by one pair of canonical variables .",
    "this pair is composed of the mass @xmath5 of the solution and its conjugate momentum , which physically represents the difference between the killing times at right and left spatial infinities . in @xcite , this method was adapted by considering a spacelike foliation to the right of the future event horizon of the solution , enabling one to find the corresponding reduced phase space . from this one",
    "can obtain a hamiltonian @xmath38 and thus the lorentzian time evolution operator @xmath39 in the schrdinger picture .",
    "this method has been applied for various theories of gravity and in several different dimensions . in @xcite , the first paper of the series ,",
    "a vacuum schwarzschild black hole in four dimensions in general relativity was placed in a box , defined as a rigid timelike frontier .",
    "the values of the metric functions were fixed both at the horizon and at the box .",
    "then , in @xcite , the same procedure was applied to a vacuum dilatonic black hole in two dimensions .",
    "here there was also a rigid frontier , where the values of the fields , dilatonic and gravitational , were fixed .",
    "afterward , in @xcite , the method was applied to the reissner - nrdstrom anti - de sitter black hole in four - dimensional einstein - maxwell theory with a negative cosmological constant .",
    "this time there was no rigid frontier , so the far away asymptotic properties were defined at anti - de sitter infinity .",
    "next , in @xcite , the same formalism is applied to the case of topological black hole solutions of the equations of motion for the four - dimensional einstein - maxwell - anti - de sitter theory , leaving however part of the hamiltonian method implicit .",
    "finally , it was shown in @xcite that the entropy could also be calculated via this hamiltonian method for five - dimensional spherically symmetric solutions of a one parameter family included within lovelock gravity theory , where the action is comprised of the ricci scalar term and the four - dimensional euler density , i.e. the gauss - bonnet term , multiplied by an undetermined coefficient .",
    "there were some other developments . in @xcite the brown - york approach and the louko - whiting approach are compared .",
    "the main differences lie in the choice of boundary conditions , resulting in the fact that the hamiltonian of brown - york is the internal energy , whereas the louko - whiting hamiltonian is the helmholtz free energy . in @xcite",
    "the louko - whiting method was applied with some modifications to generic two - dimensional dilaton - gravity theories .",
    "here we want to use the louko - whiting method to study the entropy and thermodynamic properties of three - dimensional black hole solutions in gravity theories with a dilaton , a negative cosmological constant and a free parameter @xmath0 , which can be generically comprised in a three - dimensional brans - dicke theory with a cosmological constant .",
    "there is great interest in studying three - dimensional theories of gravity .",
    "one of the main reasons is richness of structure with one dimension less @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is simpler to deal with certain concepts such as temperature , entropy , and flux of radiation when one works in three dimensions , and it also seems easier to try a three - dimensional quantum description of the black hole system . theories in three dimensions , such as general relativity , have a rich structure . indeed , three - dimensional general relativity with a negative cosmological constant has a black hole solution , the baados - teitelboim - zanelli ( btz ) black hole @xcite .",
    "the btz black hole is also a solution of string theory with a dilaton and other fields @xcite , and there is also a three dimensional black string solution which can be recovered from an exact conformal field theory @xcite .",
    "the existence of classical solutions depends on there being a negative cosmological constant . a negative constant is part of the three - dimensional black hole spacetimes structure , where the term in the action assumes a form given by @xmath40 .",
    "the cosmological constant term is therefore always negative , and thus , the black hole solutions of three - dimensional theories are usually asymptotically anti - de sitter . beyond three - dimensional general relativity and",
    "effective three - dimensional string gravity theories there are other interesting three - dimensional theories with a cosmological constant .",
    "one of these can be recovered from dimensional reduction of four - dimensional cylindrical general relativity , yielding a three - dimensional gravity with a dilaton with a particular coupling for the kinetic dilaton term @xcite .",
    "it is then natural to set up a general three - dimensional dilaton - gravity theory , by including an @xmath0 paraneter , which yields different couplings for the kinetic term of the dilaton .",
    "this theory is then brans - dicke theory in three dimensions @xcite .",
    "we will study in this connection the three - dimensional black hole solutions of @xcite , which are parametrized by the brans - dicke parameter @xmath0 , where , in principle , @xmath0 can take any value , i.e. , @xmath41 . since we want to perform a canonical hamiltonian analysis , using an adm formalism supplied with proper boundary conditions",
    ", it is necessary to pick up from the maze of solutions found in @xcite , only those that fulfill the boundary conditions we want to impose .",
    "first , we are interested only in solutions with horizons .",
    "second , we want only solutions that are asymptotically anti - de sitter at infinity .",
    "the cases of interest to be studied are then black holes for which @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 . as in @xcite",
    "we choose three typical amenable cases where an analytical study can be done .",
    "these are @xmath1 ( or equivalently @xmath45 ) , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 .",
    "the theory for which @xmath1 is general relativity , and the solution is the btz black hole @xcite .",
    "the theory for which @xmath2 is equivalent to cylindrical four - dimensional general relativity and the corresponding black hole was found in @xcite .",
    "the theory for which @xmath3 is just a case of 3d brans - dicke theory , with a black hole solution that can be analyzed in this context @xcite .",
    "if a quantum theory only makes sense if its classical form can be quantized by hamiltonian methods , one should pick up only solutions which can be put consistently in a hamiltonian form .",
    "thus , using the prescription for the canonical variables , we foliate , following adm , the three - dimensional spacetime with spacelike hypersurfaces of equal time , whose right end is at the anti - de sitter infinity , and whose left end is at the bifurcation circle of a non degenerate killing horizon .",
    "these canonical variables are then transformed to another set of appropriate canonical variables , directly related to the physical parameters of the black hole classical solutions . in turn , these latter variables are reduced to the true degrees of freedom , which can be represented by one pair of new canonical variables , the mass @xmath5 and its conjugate momentum @xmath6 .",
    "all this construction is limited to the right static region of the carter - penrose diagram of spacetime .",
    "this reduced theory is then quantized canonically . from the quantum theory",
    "obtained , one builds a time evolution operator in the schrdinger picture . upon continuation of this operator to imaginary time , inserting it into two generic base state vectors and taking the trace one obtains the canonical partition function , appropriate to a canonical ensemble .",
    "note one needs to pay attention to the boundary conditions of the ensemble when trying to build an appropriate one for the geometries of a quantum theory of gravity .",
    "these have to respect the stability properties of the semiclassical approximations of this quantum theory . here",
    "these suitable boundary conditions are ensured by the fact that the black hole solutions are asymptotically anti - de sitter .",
    "now , the partition function obtained , given the right conditions , is dominated by classical euclidean solutions .",
    "following @xcite we choose a renormalized hawking temperature , which is taken as a fixed quantity in the canonical ensemble , due to the fact that the hawking temperature of the black hole goes to zero at infinity .",
    "the entropy of the system can then be found using this whole formalism .",
    "we note that the entropy of black holes in three - dimensional dilaton - gravity theories of the kind we study , have been worked out in @xcite through a completely different approach , namely , using known properties of two - dimensional conformal field theories .",
    "as well , the entropy and thermodynamics of the btz black hole have been exhaustively studied using a number of different methods , see @xcite for a first study and @xcite for a review .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ bhsolutions ] we present the classical solutions of the three - dimensional dilatonic black holes , whose quantization through hamiltonian methods we will perform .",
    "there is a free parameter @xmath0 for which we choose three different values , @xmath46 , corresponding to the btz black hole , the dimensionally reduce four - dimensional cylindrical black hole , and a three - dimensional dilatonic black hole , respectively . in sec .",
    "[ whichallowadm ] we introduce the spacetime foliation through which we will define the canonical coordinates and which will allow us to write the action as a sum of constraints multiplied by their respective lagrange multipliers .",
    "then follow three sections , secs .",
    "[ btz ] , [ zero ] , and [ menostres ] , where we develop the thermodynamic hamiltonian formalism for the @xmath46 black holes , respectively . in each section , we first give the metric and the dilaton fields ( subsection * a * ) .",
    "then we replace in the action of the theory the foliation ansatz , with the canonical coordinates , and determine the conjugate momenta of the coordinates .",
    "from there we determine the form of the hamiltonian action through a legendre transformation .",
    "it is then necessary to guarantee that there is a well defined variational principle , so as to allow the derivation of the equations of motion of the coordinates and respective momenta .",
    "this entails adding surface terms to the original action , which in turn forces the definition of asymptotic properties for the coordinates , momenta , and lagrange multipliers .",
    "it is also necessary to fix some variables at the boundaries in order to have a well defined variational principle .",
    "after this is accomplished , we write the usual metric functions of a three - dimensional spherically symmetric , static black hole spacetime as functions of the canonical variables ( subsection * b * ) .",
    "we then choose a new set of canonical variables and perform a canonical transformation .",
    "this new set has a physical meaning , i.e. , one is the mass parameter of the black hole , and the other , the momentum conjugate to the mass , is the spatial derivative of the killing time .",
    "we rewrite the action with the new variables and obtain a new pair of constraints with a redefined pair of lagrange multipliers ( subsection * c * ) .",
    "the new action is then reduced to its true degrees of freedom , with one pair of canonical variables , the mass and its conjugate momentum .",
    "the reduced hamiltonian is nothing more than the initial surface terms written as functions of the new variables ( subsection * d * ) .",
    "we quantize the theory canonically , defining a hilbert space and an inner product therein , with the hamiltonian now being an operator in this hilbert space .",
    "we write the time evolution operator in the schrdinger picture ( subsection * e * ) . in order to obtain a thermodynamic description of the system we build a partition function in the canonical ensemble with fixed temperature by continuing the time evolution operator to imaginary time , and taking the trace in the mass eigenstates .",
    "this requires that we normalize the trace .",
    "finally , through saddle point methods we obtain the thermodynamic functions ( subsection * f * ) . in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] we discuss and conclude . throughout the paper",
    "we make @xmath47 , @xmath29 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 .",
    "three - dimensional black hole theories have been studied in , e.g. , @xcite . a general action that incorporates most of these black holes is a brans - dicke action , with gravitational and dilaton fields and a cosmological constant .",

    "first , we are interested only in solutions with horizons , so we take @xmath59 to be positive .",
    "second , apart from a measure zero of solutions , all solutions have a non - zero @xmath63 .",
    "this does not mean straight away that the solutions are asymptotically anti - de sitter .",
    "some have one type or another of singularities at infinity , which do not allow an imposition of proper boundary conditions .",
    "so , from @xcite with the corresponding carter - penrose diagrams , we discard the following solutions : @xmath64 which is simply the minkowski solution of a low - energy limit of string theory , @xmath65 since it gives weird conical singularities at carter - penrose infinity , and @xmath66 since all the carter - penrose boundary is singular .",
    "thus , the cases of interest to be studied are black holes for which @xmath1 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 . for @xmath59",

    "the coordinate @xmath70 tends to @xmath73 as the coordinates themselves tend to infinity , and @xmath21 is another time coordinate .",
    "the remaining functions are the lapse @xmath74 and shift functions @xmath75 and will play the role of lagrange multipliers of the hamiltonian of the theory .",
    "the canonical coordinates @xmath71 and the lapse function @xmath74 are taken to be positive .",
    "the angular coordinate is left untouched , due to spherical ( i.e , circular ) symmetry . the dilaton is a simple function of the radial canonical coordinate , and it can be traded directly by it through equation ( [ admphiansatz ] ) , as will be done below .",
    "the ansatz ( [ adm_ansatz])-([admphiansatz ] ) is written in order to perform the foliation of spacetime into spacelike hypersurfaces , and thus separates the spatial part of the spacetime from the temporal part .",
    "indeed , the canonical analysis requires the explicit separation of the time coordinate from the other space coordinates , and so in all expressions time is treated separately from the other coordinates .",
    "it breaks explicit , but not implicit , covariance of the three - dimensional brans - dicke theory .",
    "such a split is necessary in order to perform the hamiltonian analysis .",

    "of the terms composing it some are total derivatives which can be discarded .",
    "this may prove itself to be cumbersome .",
    "the other , simpler , way to arrive at the form of the action ( [ infty ] ) , is to dimensionally reduce , through the killing angle coordinate @xmath91 , the action before replacing the ansatz ( [ adm_ansatz])-([admphiansatz ] ) .",

    "these surface terms are eliminated through judicious choice of extra surface terms which should be added to the action .",
    "the action ( [ haction_oo ] ) has the following extra surface terms , after variation @xmath98 in order to evaluate this expression , we need to know the asymptotic conditions of each of the above functions individually , which are functions of @xmath99 .    starting with the limit @xmath100 we assume @xmath101 with these conditions , we have for the surface terms at @xmath72 @xmath102 note that there are time dependences on the left hand side of the falloff conditions and that there are no such dependences on the right hand side , in the lower orders of the expansion in @xmath70 .",
