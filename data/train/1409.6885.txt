    "a quantile - quantile plot ( qq - plot ) is a graphical method for comparing observed data with a proposed ( estimated ) distribution .",
    "often the order statistics of the data are compared with the quantiles of a distribution which is fitted to the data .",
    "for example a normal distribution can be fitted to observed independent data : @xmath2 using maximum likelihood method : @xmath3 and then to check the goodness of the fit , one can plot the order statistics , @xmath4 ( data arranged in non - decreasing order ) , versus the quantiles of the estimated distribution @xmath5 : @xmath6 for an appropriate choice of probabilities @xmath7 , which we call a _ probability index vector _ ( piv ) .",
    "the choice of the piv is the so called _ plotting positions problem_. in fact we can view this problem more generally by plotting @xmath8 versus @xmath9 , where @xmath10 are functions of the distribution of @xmath5  without mentioning or using quantiles .",
    "however one can always apply the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of @xmath5 , @xmath11 to @xmath12 to get back a piv , @xmath13 , and therefore the problem can be viewed as finding the appropriate piv at least in the continuous case , which is the case we consider here .",
    "the plotting positions problem has received significant attention in the literature .",
    "the approaches suggested can be divided into two general cases : ( 1 ) distribution - free methods ; ( 2 ) distribution - dependent methods . in ( 1 ) piv does not depend on the underlying distribution of the data and in ( 2 ) one utilizes some assumptions regarding the distribution of the data in finding the plotting positions .",
    "one may argue that in ( 2 ) if the shape of the distribution is known , a qq - plot is not useful .",
    "this is not the case because : we may have only partial information about the shape of the distribution , for example we may know that the underlying distribution is a gamma distribution and like to compare the data to a fit from the exponential distribution ( a special case of gamma distribution ) ; even in the case that the assumed distribution and the fitted distribution are the same , the qq - plot can tell us how well the estimated distribution is performing across the range of the quantiles . in this paper , we mainly focus on solving ( 1 ) but will clarify the difference in our discussion .",
    "@xcite originally suggested @xmath14 ( weibull method ) and many other authors such as @xcite and @xcite addressed this problem .",
    "@xcite provided evidence for the weibull method by showing that the probability of non - exceedance of a new sample , denoted by @xmath15 , from @xmath16 is exactly equal to @xmath17 : @xmath18 .",
    "however some other authors ( e.g.@xcite ) provide evidence for another intuitively appealing , distribution - free solution to this problem which consists of the median of the beta distribution of the cdf applied to the order statistics : @xmath19 ( discussed in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we call this method , the _ beta median _ ( bm ) method",
    ".    the contributions of this work are as follows .",
    "( 1 ) it systematically defines intuitively appealing and rigorous mathematical objectives to compare the plotting positions schemes and in each case finds the optimal plotting positions from three points of view : distribution - theoretic ; decision - theoretic ; game - theoretic .",
    "most of the other relevant works consider a distribution - theoretic approach and obtain different solutions from various assumptions ( e.g.@xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "these solutions are compared here .",
    "the decision - theoretic and game - theoretic views are new to the best of our knowledge . in the decision - theoretic framework",
    ", we find the optimal positions by minimizing appropriate loss functions defined for quantiles . in the game - theoretic framework ,",
    "we define intuitively appealing games in which two players choose plotting positions and after the true distribution ( or a future sample ) is revealed , they exchange money based on the outcome .",
    "( 2 ) this work provides a careful investigation of the accuracy of several approximations to the median of the beta distribution , specifically developed for finding the optimal plotting positions ( mostly of the form @xmath20 for some constants @xmath21 , e.g.discussed in @xcite ) along the piv ( @xmath22 ) for small and large @xmath23 .",
    "this work also provides a comprehensive comparison between the two popular solutions of the plotting positions problem ( based on the expectation and median of the corresponding beta distribution ) for arbitrary sample sizes in terms of their difference and fraction .",
    "section [ sect : frameworks ] considers three mathematical frameworks to address this problem : a distribution - theoretic framework ; a decision - theoretic framework ; a game - theoretic framework .",
    "the decision - theoretic and game - theoretic frameworks can guide a practitioner to choose the appropriate piv . in each of these frameworks",
    ", we find the optimal piv or state that it is not possible to find a distribution - free solution . in the distribution - theoretic approach",
    ", we consider the distribution of either the order statistics or their cdf and analyze what quantities of the estimated distribution match these random values better .",
    "the decision - theoretic framework uses appropriate loss functions for quantiles which are invariant under monotonic transformations of data ( and distributions ) to pick the optimal piv . in the game - theoretic approach ,",
    "we envision some gambling games in which players pick a piv in order to compete for monetary values and the solution to the plotting positions problem is deduced from the optimal strategy of the player .",
    "section [ sect : approx ] discusses some approximations to the beta median method and shows that for an approximation of the popular form @xmath24 , to perform well at @xmath25 , when @xmath23 becomes large , it is necessary to have @xmath26 ( where @xmath27 denotes natural logarithm ) .",
    "however for such choice of @xmath28 , this approximation is not very accurate in some percentiles , for example around the @xmath29 percentile of the data .",
    "we show that the algorithm developed by @xcite performs well across the data range .",
    "this algorithm is implemented in r for calculating the quantiles of a given beta distribution but is not the default for calculating plotting positions . section [",
    "sect : comparison ] compares the piv of weibull method to the piv of beta median method .",
    "we make a comparison between the plotting positions both in terms of their difference and ratio .",
    "the plotting positions of the two methods are always close in terms of their difference .",
    "they are also close in terms of their ratio toward the center of piv , but they differ at the two ends of the piv .",
    "[ sect : frameworks ]    first we introduce notation for the rest of the paper .",
    "let @xmath30 be a univariate independent identically distributed ( i.i.d ) sample from a continuous random variable @xmath31 with cdf @xmath32 .",
    "we denote the quantile function ( the inverse of @xmath32 ) by @xmath33 and the non - decreasingly ordered sample by @xmath34 .",
    "then we define @xmath35 to be the ( random ) probability of non - exceedance from each sample point .",
    "note that the @xmath36 sequence is i.i.d with uniform distribution on [ 0,1 ] and denote the ordered sample by @xmath37 . since @xmath32 is non - decreasing",
    ", we have , @xmath38 .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath37 follows a beta distribution ( e.g.@xcite ) with density function : @xmath39 for @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "we denote this distribution by @xmath42 . in the following",
    "we find the optimal plotting positions using three frameworks : distribution - theoretic approach ; decision - theoretic approach ; game - theoretic approach .      here",
    "we use distribution theory to find the plotting positions .",
    "suppose we intend to create a qq - plot of the order statistics with respect to a proposed distribution @xmath5 with cdf @xmath11 . in order to find the location of plotting positions for the order statistics @xmath16",
    ", we can consider the solution to be any of the following :    * the plotting position for @xmath16 should be the value of @xmath32 at the average of @xmath16 in an appropriate sense , for example the expectation or the median : @xmath43 then @xmath44 is not distribution - free . in order to show that , consider the special case of a random sample with only one element ( @xmath45 ) and let @xmath31 be distributed as exponential distribution with parameter @xmath46 and cdf @xmath47 . then @xmath48 which depends on @xmath46 .",
    "however @xmath49 is distribution - free because for a strictly increasing function @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52 therefore in order to calculate @xmath49 , we can assume @xmath31 is a uniform distribution on [ 0,1 ] , which we denote by @xmath53 .",
    "we conclude @xmath54 and therefore @xmath49 is equal to the median of @xmath42 .",
    "in fact @xcite suggest using @xmath49 as an intuitively appealing formula for plotting positions and develop polynomial equations to find them .",
    "these polynomials were also developed in @xcite ( pages 234 and 235 ) where the choice for the plotting positions is motivated by a decision - theoretic approach . *",
    "the plotting position for @xmath16 should be the value in @xmath11 , corresponding to the average @xmath37 in an appropriate sense , either the expectation or the median : @xmath55 since @xmath56 , @xmath57 and the median does not have closed form . later we will discuss the approximations to this median . *",
    "consider a new unobserved sample @xmath15 .",
    "then the plotting position of @xmath16 should be the probability of non - exceedance of this new sample , @xmath15 , from @xmath16 : @xmath58 which is the same as weibull method .",
    "this is essentially the content of @xcite and @xcite .      in this section ,",
    "we take a decision - theoretic approach by considering appropriate loss functions for assigning the plotting positions . for example",
    ", we can measure the loss by the absolute value loss @xmath59 .",
    "since it is a random quantity , we minimize the expected loss : @xmath60}{argmin}\\ ; e \\{|x_{(i)}-q_x(p)|\\}.\\ ] ] again the solution to this is not distribution - free since a loss function defined as such is not distribution - free ( or equivalently it is not invariant under strictly monotonic distributions ) .",
    "@xcite and @xcite introduced loss functions for quantiles which are invariant under strictly monotonic functions .",
    "the _ probability loss ( pl ) function _ corresponding to a random variable @xmath31 with distribution function @xmath32 is defined to be @xmath61 which is simply equal to @xmath62 if the distribution is continuous . also note that @xmath63 only depends on the random variable @xmath31 through its distribution @xmath32 .",
    "therefore we can apply this definition to a distribution function @xmath32 and denote it by @xmath64 .",
    "we can also apply this loss to functions of data , @xmath65 ( e.g.@xmath66 ) : @xmath67 @xcite showed many desirable properties of this loss function , in particular its invariance under strictly monotonic transformations of the real numbers : let @xmath68 be a strictly monotonic function , then pl satisfies the following invariance : @xmath69 moreover , this loss is symmetric and it can be shown that it satisfies the triangle inequality for the continuous variables ( @xcite ) . since this loss is random in general , we need to consider a measure of average loss such as expectation .    to obtain a distribution - free solution",
    ", we utilize the _ expected pl _ ( epl ) : @xmath60}{argmin}e\\{\\delta_{x } ( x_{(i)},q_x(p))\\}.   \\label{eqn - pi - epl}\\ ] ] we also assume that the underlying distribution is continuous .",
    "then the solution and its properties are given in the following theorem .",
    "suppose a random sample @xmath30 from a continuous distribution function @xmath70 is given .",
    "then @xmath71 is minimized uniquely by @xmath72 .",
    "moreover @xmath73 is the solution of the equation @xmath74 when solving for @xmath75 , and we have @xmath76 .",
    "[ theo - qq - plot ]    for the first part , note that we want to minimize : @xmath77 however @xmath78 is minimized by choosing @xmath79 to be the median of @xmath80 and we know that @xmath56 .",
    "to prove @xmath73 is the solution of the equation @xmath74 when solving for @xmath75 , note that under the continuity assumption , we have @xmath81 since @xmath32 is a continuous random variable , @xmath82 is also continuous .",
    "hence the minimum is obtained by solving @xmath83 .",
    "this is equivalent to @xmath84 .",
    "it is well - known that ( e.g.@xcite ) the distribution of the order statistics , @xmath16 is given by @xmath85 hence , the minimum is obtained by solving @xmath86 which does not have a closed form solution in general . also note that the solution does not depend on @xmath32 .",
    "however , the solution always exists and is unique since @xmath87 is monotonic for each @xmath88 , continuous on [ 0,1 ] and ranges between 0 and 1 .",
    "finally the fact that the resulting piv is symmetric follows from the symmetry of the beta cdf as seen in equation [ eqn - beta - density ] .",
    "these equations can be solved for @xmath89 . for @xmath90",
    ", we have @xmath91 . for @xmath92 , we have @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "note that for arbitrary @xmath23 , the last equation is @xmath95 .",
    "hence we have @xmath96{2}$ ] and @xmath97{2}$ ] .",
    "@xcite introduced a related non - random loss which does not require taking the expectations and is more appropriate when the future sample is of interest . the _ future - value probability loss _ ( fpl ) for functions of data @xmath65 ( e.g.@xmath98 ) , is defined by @xmath99 where @xmath100 a new independent draw ( future draw ) of the random variable of interest .",
    "again we can show the desirable properties of this loss including an its invariance under strictly monotonic transformations : if two statistics ( functions of data ) , @xmath65 , are _ equivariant _ under a strictly monotonic transformation @xmath101 , i.e. @xmath102 then @xmath103 note that @xmath104 is not random .",
    "therefore , we let : @xmath60}{argmin}\\ ; \\gamma_{x}(x_{(i)},q_x(p)).\\ ] ]    the plotting position for @xmath16 by minimizing @xmath105 is given by @xmath106 [ theo - gamma ]    we denote the cdf of @xmath16 by @xmath107 and proceed as follows .",
    "@xmath108 which is again minimized at @xmath109 .      here",
    "we provide a game - theoretic approach for the plotting positions problem . since we are mainly interested in distribution - free results , we formulate the games in terms of @xmath37 .",
    "however they can also be formulated in terms of @xmath16 to get distribution - dependent results .",
    "this framework clarifies which plotting positions scheme is the most appropriate for the given objective .",
    "we consider four games in which two players a and b , use their method of picking the plotting positions for @xmath37 , denoted by @xmath110 respectively and bet on the result .",

    "a judge will keep sampling from the true distribution until @xmath15 : falls between @xmath126 and @xmath16 , but not between @xmath127 and @xmath16 , in which case a pays one dollar to b ; or falls between @xmath128 and @xmath16 , but not between @xmath129 and @xmath16 , in which case b pays one dollar to a. the player a can find the best strategy by minimizing for @xmath79 in @xmath130 and the solution is again @xmath131 as shown in theorem [ theo - gamma ] .",
    "we have seen that the desirable solution for the plotting position , @xmath73 in many frameworks has turned out to be the median of the beta distribution : @xmath132 which is equal to the solution of the equation @xmath133 and also appears in @xcite and @xcite . by symmetry of piv ( theorem [ theo - qq - plot ] ) , we need to solve either @xmath134 or @xmath135 . since the polynomials @xmath135 are all increasing in @xmath136 , a bisection method can be used to find the solution with any desired accuracy .",
    "however , this method becomes slow for large @xmath23 because of the binomial coefficients calculation .",
    "fortunately , a fast algorithm for calculating the quantiles of the beta distribution is developed by @xcite which is implemented in c and r languages . below",

    "explicitly note that the solution obtained through the bisection algorithm will be called exact method since it can be found with any desired accuracy ( i.e. , the length of the interval obtained at the last iteration ) . despite the existence of good algorithms to approximate the median of beta distribution , many authors and packages use simpler formulas for approximating the median for the qq - plot purpose .",
    "there are various measures of the form @xmath137 suggested in the literature to approximate the median of the corresponding beta distribution which is the same as the solution to @xmath138 . due to the existence of more exact solutions for the median such as the one developed by @xcite ( cran s method ) ,",
    "there is little practical need for solutions of the form @xmath137 .",
    "however , because of the popularity of these solutions and their implementation in commercial software , it is interesting to compare the accuracy of different choices for @xmath28 and @xmath139 . in particular we require @xmath28 and @xmath139 to satisfy the following constraints :    * @xmath140 should be equal to 1/2 , when @xmath23 is odd and @xmath141",

    "this follows from the limit argument given in equation [ eqn - limit - p1 ] for @xmath232 , in which case @xmath233",
    "this work investigated the plotting positions problem using various frameworks : + distribution - theoretic ; decision - theoretic ; game - theoretic . while there has been a lot of previous work in this area ",
    "each suggesting a different formula for the plotting positions  the validity and the assumptions under which any of these formulas are valid were not clear .",
    "this work addresses this issue by deriving the distribution - free plotting positions under various reasonable objectives which are understandable by practitioners .",
    "two solutions which came out of the analysis in the above frameworks were the weibull ( expectation of beta ) and the beta median methods . despite the popularity of the weibull method ( e.g.@xcite )",
    ", we showed that it is not the only correct solution to this problem and the beta median method is the optimal under various scenarios  for example to minimize the probability loss function ( pl ) or to have more chance to win a game in which the winner picks the closest quantile from the true distribution to the given order statistics .    in this paper",
    ", we also investigated some approximations to the beta median method .",
    "in particular , we considered the approximations of the form @xmath20 and showed that if this approximation is to be symmetric ( @xmath234 ) , it should have the form @xmath235 ( which is also a form suggested by @xcite and @xcite ) . to be close to the exact value at @xmath158 , for large @xmath23 , we must have @xmath26 . in that case",
    ", we showed that it is not a very accurate approximation for example around the 10th percentile , hence concluding no such approximation of the form @xmath20 would be adequately accurate .",
    "moreover , the approximation of @xcite allowing @xmath28 to vary with @xmath23 which is exact on @xmath158 suffers from the same issue . by numerical analysis and by inspecting the limits of @xmath236 when @xmath23 becomes large ( equation [ eqn - limit - p1 ] ) , we showed that another popular approximation , which assumes @xmath237 while performing better in the middle of the probability index vector , it fails at the small and large indices , e.g.@xmath158 .",
    "fortunately our numerical analysis showed that the algorithm of @xcite , which is also implemented in c and r to calculate the median of the beta distribution , works well across the probability index vector .",
    "however this is not routinely used in making the qq - plots in r or spss and instead approximations of the form @xmath238 for some @xmath21 are used ( @xcite ) . in summary , if the weibull method is desired , then this is accurate by letting @xmath239 .",
    "however if the beta median method is desired , we recommend using the algorithm of @xcite which is readily available in r.    finally , we made a comparison between the plotting positions of weibull method and beta median method , in terms of their difference and ratio . in summary",
    "the plotting positions of the two method are always close in terms of difference .",
    "they are also close in terms of their ratio toward the center of piv , but they differ at the two ends of piv .    *",
