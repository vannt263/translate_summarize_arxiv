    "in order to select neutrino events with the highest energies , we consider muon neutrino interactions in the rock around the detector , because the effective target volume is very much increased  @xcite . to separate neutrino - induced muons from cosmic ray muons , we select only upward - going muons , since the background from downward going cosmic ray muons overwhelms any neutrino - induced muons from above .",
