    "the electronic structure calculations in nano - scale structures have attracted considerable attention .",
    "it is much desirable to achieve molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations with quantum mechanical electronic structure calculation for systems of several hundred thousands atoms with a few hundred pico - seconds ( or longer time ) process , since the atomic structure is very essential to the electronic structure and _ vice versa_. requirement for higher accuracy of the total electronic structure energy in nano - scale systems and that for larger system size contradict each other .",
    "one of possible choices for satisfying these requirements could be the lda ( local density approximation ) calculation with massive - parallel computation . even in that case ,",
    "a long - time process for md simulations is another difficulty .    in the present paper , we propose one possible way to pursue a quantum mechanical md simulation of large system size and long time process at the expense of lower accuracy of the electronic structure energy .",
    "the first - principles tight - binding method is one of promising techniques and we review the `` _ atom - superposition and electron - delocalization molecular - orbitals theory _ '' with self - consistent charge density in section [ ased ] .",
    "then , based on the tight - binding formulation , we develop novel algorithm of linear algebra for large scale systems with the non - orthogonal local orbitals in section [ krylov ] .",
    "section [ application ] is devoted to present applications to nano - scale systems , the fracture propagation and surface reconstruction in si single crystals and the proton transfer in water .",
    "section [ conclusion ] is conclusions .",
    "we have several semi - empirical tight - binding formalisms  @xcite whose results are comparable to those of the first - principles lda calculation . we have also several theories of first principles tight - binding hamiltonian , e.g. the tight - binding lmto method ,  @xcite the lda tight - binding method ,  @xcite the first principles tight - binding method of the naval research laboratory ( nrl ) .",
    "@xcite we explain in the next subsection the tight - binding hamiltonian of the ` atom - superposition and electron - delocalization molecular - orbital ' theory .",
    "@xcite      the _ atom - superposition and electron - delocalization molecular - orbital _",
    "( ased ) theory is based on a charge - density partitioning method , where the charge density is determined by the mulliken method of partitioning the overlap charge density ( the mulliken charge ) of assumed atomic orbitals .",
    "diagonal elements of the hamiltonian matrix in the extended hckel theory would be given as the valence orbital ionization potential with a quadratic formula of the mulliken charge .",
    "in the present form of the ased theory , a diagonal element of the hamiltonian @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 denote an atom and its orbital , is set to equal to an atomic energy level ( ionization energy ) @xmath3 .",
    "an off - diagonal element of the hamiltonian is determined by the bond formation and an extended hckel - like delocalization energy may be generally a good approximation ;  @xcite @xmath4 where a coefficient @xmath5 stands for distortion of wavefunctions depending upon orbitals and a distance @xmath6 ,  @xcite and @xmath7 is the overlap integral .",
    "another contribution to the total energy is the ion - core repulsive energy , which is defined , in the tight - binding density functional ( dft ) formalism  @xcite , to be the difference between lda energy and the tight - binding band structure energy .",
    "the charge transfer effects is crucial within the charge self - consistent ( csc ) theory and formulated by the second order perturbation theory ,  @xcite which gives a form of the extended hubbard - type coulomb interaction as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the deviation of the ( mulliken - type ) charge of an atom @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the ( diagonal or off - diagonal ) coulomb interaction between atoms @xmath1 and @xmath10 or the chemical hardness .",
    "we are applying the csc tight - binding method to water , molecular liquids and soft materials of nano - scale size ( @xmath12  atoms ) .",
    "a md simulation of a proton transfer in water will be presented preliminarily in this paper .",
    "in order to study electronic structures in nano - scale materials , it is much desirable to construct the order-@xmath13 algorithm whose computational load , e.g. cpu time and memory size , is proportional to the system size or the number of atoms .",
    "problems on electronic properties in materials starts usually from obtaining eigen - energies and eigen - functions in materials or solving linear equations to find @xmath14 for a given state @xmath15 and a given energy @xmath16 ; @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a one - electron ( hermitian ) hamiltonian operator .",
    "once we solve eq.([base-2 ] ) and find a vector @xmath14 , the matrix elements of the green s function @xmath19 can be evaluated very easily as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is an infinitesimally small ( positive ) number .      in case of the orthogonal basis set",
    ", the lanczos process and the shifted conjugate orthogonal conjugate gradient ( cocg ) method  @xcite can be constructed in the framework of the krylov subspace generated by @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "when the basis set @xmath24 is non - orthogonal , the overlap of wavefunctions @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) is define by the `` @xmath27-product '' as @xmath28 and @xmath29 is an element of the overlap matrix .    with a non - symmetric ( non - hermitian ) matrix @xmath30",
    ", we can get the three - term recursive equation or the generalized lanczos process as @xmath31 for @xmath32 and @xmath33 with the  s - orthogonality \" as @xmath34 we can set @xmath35 s ( @xmath36 ) to be positive numbers .",
    "the generalized krylov subspace is spanned by the vectors @xmath37 and defined as @xmath38    within the set of basis @xmath39 or the resultant ` generalized ' krylov subspace , the ` hamiltonian matrix @xmath40 ' is tri - diagonalized on the basis of @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , one can calculate the green s function in this ` generalized ' krylov subspace and also achieve the spectral decomposition ( the subspace diagonalization ) in the ` generalized ' krylov subspace , which we call the generalized lanczos method .      even for non - orthogonal basis set",
    ", we can generalize the cocg procedure , similar to the original one ,  @xcite for the hamiltonian @xmath22 and the overlap matrix @xmath27 .",
    "the linear equation of the ` seed ' energy ( an arbitrary chosen energy ) @xmath42 can be written as @xmath43 an approximate solution at the @xmath44-th iteration , a searching direction for the solution at the next iteration step , and a residual vector are written as @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "we can get a recursive equations under an appropriate initial conditions ; @xmath48 with @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .    for non - orthogonal basis set",
    ", we can generalize the shift equation .",
    "the linear equation of a ` shift ' energy @xmath52 is as follows ; @xmath53    then the entire information is delivered to the coefficients @xmath54 and @xmath55 at every shift energy @xmath52 by a scalar constant @xmath56 , which is generated by the recursive equation @xmath57 the most important issue of the shift equation is the theorem of _ collinear residual _ :  @xcite @xmath58 then , once the solution is obtained at the seed energy by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : cgp : p])@xmath59([eq : cgp : r ] ) , solutions at arbitrary shift energies can be evaluated by using only scalar - scaler and scalar - vector multiplications .",
    "the only remaining problem is the calculation of @xmath60 .",
    "fortunately , the overlap matrix @xmath27 is positive - definite and nearly equal to the unit matrix .",
    "therefore , we can solve this equation efficiently by the cg method , e.g. solve inversely @xmath61 for a given @xmath47 .",
    "the choice of the seed energy @xmath42 is not unique .",
    "if one would choose a seed energy in an energy range of faster convergence , spectra at majority energy points have not be converged yet after achieving the convergence at the seed energy . in that case",
    ", one might restart the calculation with new seed energy from the beginning .",
    "the _ seed - switching _ is very efficient technique to avoid waste of the already finished part of constructing the krylov subspace .",
    "@xcite one can choose a new seed energy @xmath62 and can continue the calculation without discarding the information of the previous calculation with the old seed energy @xmath42 .",
    "we have explained the generalized lanczos method and the generalized shifted cocg method .",
    "now we present the calculated results of the local density of states ( ldos ) by using the tight - binding hamiltonian with non - orthogonalized basis set given by the nrl hamiltonian .",
    "@xcite the system is of gold 256 atoms in a supercell of an fcc structure with s- , p- , and d - orbitals under a periodic boundary condition .",
    "figure  [ fig - ldos - test ] shows the ldos of d - orbitals , where the vertical axis is in logarithmic scale to see the behavior of tails .",
    "the three calculated results , the generalized lanczos method , the generalized shifted cocg method and the exact calculation , are almost identical with each other .",
    "the cpu times by a standard work - station of a single processor are 3.92  s , 21.20  s and 57.6  s for the generalized lanczos method , the generalized shifted cocg and the exact calculation , respectively .",
    "the algorithm of the present developed algebraic methods is suitable for parallel computation . on the other hands",
    ", the cpu time grows as a cubic power of the matrix size in the exact calculation .",
    "therefore , the present methods are promising in large scale electronic structure calculations .",
    "much attention has been paid to nano - scale systems and the first principles molecular dynamics simulation has become more important in material sciences and engineering .",
    "we have developed a set of computational methods of electronic structure calculations , _ i.e. _ the generalized wannier state methods ,  @xcite the krylov subspace method ,  @xcite and the shifted cocg method for nano - scale systems .",
    "@xcite in the preceding sections , we have explained recent development on the ased and generalized shifted cocg method .",
    "the tight - binding md simulation method with being - developed linear algebraic algorithm is useful to achieve calculations in extra - large systems whose computational cost increases linearly proportional to the system size as shown in fig.[fig - bench ] , where tested examples are metallic , insulating and semiconducting dense materials .      here",
    ", we will show a calculation results of fracture propagation in a bulk si single crystal with the semi - empirical tight - binding hamiltonian by kwon _",
    "et al _  @xcite , based on the orthogonal basis set .",
    "the cleavage propagation speed is estimated , in the present model , as @xmath63 , which is comparable to the velocity of the rayleigh wave @xmath64 .",
    "@xcite    the easy - propagating plane of fracture in si is known widely to be that of ( 110 ) or ( 111 ) and we studied the phenomena of fracture propagation in 14  nm scale si crystals .",
    "@xcite in case of fracture on the ( 111 ) plane , the the pandy structure  @xcite of ( 111)-@xmath65 surface reconstruction appears with several steps .",
    "the direction or the structure of fracture propagation planes is not explained by the stabilization energy of the final stable surfaces structure because a transient surface structure is first formed immediately after the bond - breaking and , after appearance of the ideal surface , the surface reconstruction happens to form the final reconstructed surface . in the process of fracture propagation and surface reconstruction ,",
    "the two different kinds of energy loss and gain compete with each other , e.g. the energy competition between an electronic energy gain of breaking bonds and an elastic energy loss of distorting the lattice .",
    "this kind competition may be possible only in nano - scale systems and , in a md simulation , we should prepare larger systems , e.g. a few tens nm length .",
    "then , even a fracture propagation starts on a ( 001 ) plane , the plane of the fracture propagation changes to ( 111 ) and ( 110 ) planes .",

    "we have been applying the ased method to water and proton transfer in water to investigate the applicability of the method .",
    "the bond angle h - o - h ( an experimental value 104.5@xmath67 ) is determined sensitively by the energy levels ( binding energy and bond angle dependence ) 1b@xmath68 and 3a@xmath69 of h@xmath68o , which could be done by adjusting the ionic energy levels @xmath70 and @xmath71 of oxygen 2s and 2p orbitals and their sto parameters .",
    "after that , we could obtain the correct order of molecular energy levels of ( 2a@xmath69 ) , ( 1b@xmath68 ) , ( 3a@xmath69 ) , ( 1b@xmath69 ) , ( 4a@xmath69 ) , ( 2b@xmath68 ) and an approximate cohesive energy of a molecule ( 10.97  ev , cf . the experimental value of 10.08  ev ) .",
    "the bond length can be adjusted by slight rescaling the two - body repulsive term and the resultant bond length is 3.168and the csc scheme works efficiently ( cf .",
    "2.797without csc scheme and 2.967by gaussian b3lyp/6 - 31g(d , p ) ) .",
    "once we include h 2p state in the calculation , the molecular dimer configuration @xmath72 , @xmath73 can be obtained , which is in good agreement with the results of gaussian calculation ( @xmath74 and @xmath73 .",
    "see the inset in fig .",

    "another proton will transfer from the oxonium ion h@xmath75o@xmath76 to that of c. the inset shows the definition of angles @xmath2 and @xmath77 for a stable configuration of a water dimer . ]",
    "then we simulate the proton transfer in a water system 100h@xmath68o + h@xmath75o@xmath76 and observe the proton transfer process to happen in a recombination of h@xmath75o@xmath78 + h@xmath68o @xmath79 h@xmath68o + h@xmath75o@xmath78 ( hopping of a proton ) but not the transfer of an oxonium ion h@xmath75o@xmath78 itself and the jumping time is of the order of 1  ps .",
    "furthermore , we observe the following elementary process within an order of 0.1  ps ; + ( 1 ) a h@xmath75o@xmath78 ion tries to find a proper one in near - neighboring h@xmath68o molecules , + ( 2 ) a h@xmath75o@xmath78 ion forms a weak bond with one of h@xmath68o ( forming h@xmath75o@xmath76+h@xmath68o ) , and + ( 3 ) a proton transfers to that h@xmath68o , forming h@xmath68o+h@xmath75o@xmath76",
    ". + ( 4 ) if this h@xmath68o is proper one , the new h@xmath68o molecule ( the former h@xmath75o@xmath78 ion ) rotates ( to form a stable water dimer 2h@xmath68o ) and change to a stable configuration and , at the same time , + ( 5 ) a new h@xmath75o@xmath78 ejects a proton h@xmath76 to a next h@xmath68o .    from these observation , we may conclude that the ased framework can work properly in a wide variety of materials .",
    "the present system size of water is still too small to use the generalized lanczos method and the generalized shifted cocg method .",
    "even so , we have already assured these methods for working in the md simulation in the present system .",
    "we have reviewed our recently developed methods of ased based on the generalized hckel approximation and the novel linear algebraic algorithm for large - scale quantum molecular dynamics simulation .",
    "the crucial point is that the novel linear algebraic algorithm is applicable to systems of several thousand atoms or more with the same accuracy of the exact calculation .",
    "then we presented examples of the applications to the fracture propagation and surface reconstruction in si and the proton transfer in water .",
    "the water is very sensitive and difficult systems to simulate and the successful results suggest that our proposed simulation method is promising in a wide variety of systems , dense or dilute , solids , liquids or soft materials , and metals or insulators .",
    "the present md simulation method was applied also to the problems of the formation of helical multishell au nanowire  @xcite and the diamond - graphite transformation under applied stress  @xcite .",
