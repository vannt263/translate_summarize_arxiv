    "measuring cosmological parameters with observational data plays a crucial role in establishing the modern cosmology . in the past few years , with great progresses on astronomical observations , such as type - ia supernovae ( sn ) @xcite , cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) @xcite and large scale structure ( lss ) @xcite ,",
    "a standard cosmological model is build up .",
    "it is commonly believed that our universe has undergone an inflationary period at the beginning and is accelerating expansion at present .",
    "dark energy , the mysterious source driving the present acceleration of our universe , has been studied widely in the literature since its discovery in 1998 @xcite .",
    "however , the nature of dark energy , encoded in its equation of state ( eos ) parameter @xmath0 , remains controversial .",
    "for the other acceleration in the very early universe , the mechanics of inflation can naturally explain the flatness , homogeneity and isotropy of our universe .",
    "inflation stretches the primordial density fluctuations and seeds the presently observed cmb and lss .",
    "understanding the dynamics of inflation and the origin of late - time acceleration are big challenges in physics and astronomy .    with the accumulation of observational data from cmb , lss and sn observations and the improvements of the data quality",
    ", there are a lot of efforts in the literature on constraining the cosmological parameters from various observations @xcite , such as the eos of dark energy models @xmath0 , the curvature of the universe @xmath1 , the total neutrino masses @xmath2 , and those associated with the running of the spectral index and gravitational waves . however , using different input theoretical model can affect constraints of cosmological parameters , since some of cosmological parameters are correlated with each other . including or ignoring these degeneracies will give significantly different constraints on cosmological parameters .",
    "for example , the eos of dark energy @xmath0 correlates with the matter energy density @xmath6 and the curvature @xmath1 through the geometrical distance relations . due to the strong correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath1",
    ", we obtain different constraints on dark energy eos @xmath0 in the framework of flat and non - flat universe , respectively @xcite .",
    "the eos of dark energy also anti - correlates with the total neutrino mass , namely , the larger neutrino mass can be mimicked by the more negative @xmath0 for the same distance relations @xcite . in the framework of dynamical dark energy model , the constraint on @xmath2 is significantly weakened , when comparing with that obtained from the standard @xmath7cdm model .",
    "furthermore , the tensor perturbation mode and the dark energy component are correlated , since they mostly affect the large scale ( low multipoles ) temperature power spectrum of cmb .",
    "thus , including the tensor fluctuations in the analysis will change the constraint of @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , some other cosmological parameters , such as , the initial conditions , inflationary parameters , can also influence the numerical results through the degeneracies .    at present",
    ", we have a lot of cosmological observations , such as several hundred sn samples , cmb temperature and polarization fluctuation , lss surveys and so forth .",
    "it is possible for us to study the determination of cosmological parameters precisely , especially the parameters correlating with @xmath0 .",
    "thus , in this paper , we study the uncertainties of the constraining cosmological parameters in detail , due to the correlations among them . by employing the markov chain monte carlo method , we combine the latest observational data , such as seven - year wmap data ( wmap7 ) , baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) and the `` union2.1 '' compilation sn sample to constrain cosmological parameters in different input cosmological models , such as the non - flat universe , the massive neutrino mass models , and so on .",
    "we pay particular attention on the degeneracies among these parameters .",
    "furthermore , we also generate the mock data for the future observations , such as planck @xcite and euclid @xcite projects , as well as future sn observations @xcite to study their capabilities on breaking these degeneracies .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in section [ method ] we describe the method and the current and future observational data sets we use ; section [ results ] contains our main numerical results on the cosmological parameters , and the last section is the summary .",
    "in order to get constraints in different cosmological models , we employ the modified version of the mcmc package cosmomc @xcite and perform the global fitting analysis with the current and future observational data .",
    "we parameterize the cosmology with the following parameters : @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 , in which @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the physical baryon and cold dark matter densities relative to the critical density , @xmath1 is the spatial curvature and satisfies @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the ratio ( multiplied by 100 ) of the sound horizon to the angular diameter distance at decoupling , @xmath15 is the optical depth to re - ionization , @xmath16 is the dark matter neutrino fraction at present@xcite , namely , @xmath17 the primordial scalar power spectrum @xmath18 is parameterized as @xcite : @xmath19 ^ 2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is defined as the amplitude of initial power spectrum , @xmath3 measures the spectral index , @xmath21 is the running of the scalar spectral index and @xmath5 is the tensor to scalar ratio of the primordial spectrum . for the pivot scale we set @xmath22mpc@xmath23 which is the default value of cosmomc package .",
    "@xmath24 and @xmath25 are the parameters of dark energy , and the eos is parameterized as @xcite : @xmath26 ( noted as `` cpl '' ) , where @xmath27 is the scale factor and it covers @xmath7cdm model by taking @xmath28 and @xmath29 . as we know , for time evolving dark energy model , it is crucial to include dark energy perturbations in the global fitting strategy to constrain cosmological parameters @xcite . in this paper",
    "we use the method provided in refs.@xcite to treat the dark energy perturbations consistently in the whole parameter space in the numerical calculations .        in our analysis , we consider the following cosmological probes : i ) power spectra of cmb temperature and polarization anisotropies ; ii ) the baryon acoustic oscillation in the galaxy power spectra ; iii ) measurement of the current hubble constant ; iv ) luminosity distances of type ia supernovae .",
    "to incorporate the wmap7 cmb temperature and polarization power spectra , we use the routines for computing the likelihood supplied by the wmap team @xcite .",
    "the wmap7 polarization data are composed of te / ee / bb power spectra on large scales ( @xmath30 ) and te power spectra on small scales ( @xmath31 ) , while the wmap7 temperature data includes the cmb anisotropies on scales @xmath32 .",
    "baryon acoustic oscillations provides an efficient method for measuring the expansion history by using features in the clustering of galaxies within large scale surveys as a ruler with which to measure the distance - redshift relation .",
    "the bao aries because that the coupling of baryons and photons by thomson scattering in the early universe allows acoustic oscillations in the plasma at early time .",
    "after photons decoupling , the acoustic waves can propagate a certain distance , which becomes a characteristic comoving scale and remains in the distribution of galaxies .",
    "it provides a particularly roburst quantity to measure@xcite .",
    "bao has been detected in the current galaxy redshift survey data from the sdss dr7 @xcite .",
    "it measures not only the angular diameter distance , @xmath33 , but also the expansion rate of the universe , @xmath34 , which is powerful for studying dark energy @xcite . since the current bao data are not accurate enough for extracting the information of @xmath33 and @xmath34 separately @xcite , one can only determine an effective distance @xcite : @xmath35^{1/3}$ ] .",
    "in this paper we use the bao measurement given by the sdss - ii survey @xcite .    in our analysis , we add a gaussian prior on the current hubble constant given by ref .",
    "@xcite ; @xmath36 kms@xmath37mpc@xmath37 ( 68% c.l . ) .",
    "the quoted error includes both statistical and systematic errors .",
    "this measurement of @xmath38 is obtained from the magnitude - redshift relation of 240 low - z type ia supernovae at @xmath39 by the near infrared camera and multi - object spectrometer ( nicmos ) camera 2 of the hubble space telescope ( hst ) .",
    "this is a significant improvement over the previous prior , @xmath40 kms@xmath37mpc@xmath37 , which is from the hubble key project final result .",
    "in addition , we impose a weak top - hat prior on the hubble parameter : @xmath41 $ ] kms@xmath37mpc@xmath37 .",
    "finally , we include data from type ia supernovae , which consists of luminosity distance measurements as a function of redshift , @xmath42 .",
    "in this paper we use the latest sn data sets from the supernova cosmology project , `` union compilation 2.1 '' , which consists of 580 samples and spans the redshift range @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "this data set also provides the covariance matrix of data with and without systematic errors . in order to be conservative",
    ", we use the covariance matrix with systematic errors . when calculating the likelihood from sn , we marginalize over the absolute magnitude m , which is a nuisance parameter , as done in refs . @xcite .",
    "since the current observations can not give the conclusive conclusion , we also use the simulated data from future observations of planck and euclid , as well as the sn sample . for the cmb simulation",
    "we consider a simple full - sky ( @xmath44 ) simulation at planck - like sensitivity .",
    "we neglect foregrounds and assume the isotropic noise with variance @xmath45 and a symmetric gaussian beam of 7 arcminutes full - width half - maximum ( fwhm ) .",
    "we use the simulated @xmath46 up to @xmath47 for temperature to simulate the mock temperature power spectrum and find that the obtained constraints on cosmological parameters are almost unchanged . ] and @xmath48 for polarization .    for the future lss survey",
    ", we simply consider the euclid - like survey which will measure @xmath49 galaxies with the redshifts @xmath50 . in the measurements of large scale matter power spectrum of galaxies",
    "there are generally two statistical errors : sample variance and shot noise .",
    "the uncertainty due to statistical effects , averaged over a radial bin @xmath51 in fourier space , is @xcite : @xmath52 the initial factor of 2 is due to the real property of the density field , @xmath53 is the survey volume , and @xmath54 is the mean galaxy density . in our simulations for simplicity and to be conservative , we use only the linear matter power spectrum up to @xmath55mpc@xmath37 . for the future supernovae observation , we simulate 4000 sn samples distributed in 17 bins from @xmath56 to @xmath57 . we also include @xmath58 low - z sn from the nearby supernova factory @xcite to improve the constraints . for all the supernovae samples",
    ", we assume the variance @xmath59 in each redshift bin .",
    "in this section , we present the numerical results from current observational data sets with different input theoretical models . here",
    ", we mainly focus on the eos of dark energy , the primordial power spectrum index , and the total neutrino mass .",

    "vi we list the constraints of these inflationary parameters from two mock data .    using the correct input model , we obtain very stringent constraints on @xmath3 and @xmath4 : @xmath63 , @xmath64 ( 68% c.l . ) , whose error bars are almost shrunk by a factor of 10 . when assuming the spectral index is scale - independent ( @xmath65 ) , the constraint of @xmath3 changes : @xmath66 at the 68% confidence level .",

    "we compare these two results in figure [ fc_asns ] .",
    "the obtained correlation coefficient between @xmath3 and @xmath4 is @xmath67 , which means this degeneracy does not show in the future data significantly .",
