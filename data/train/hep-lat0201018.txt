    "monopoles have been studied within both abelian @xcite and non - abelian @xcite gauge theories .",
    "usually one starts with a classical monopole configuration ( _ i.e. _ having a magnetic field which becomes coulombic as @xmath1 ) and then consider the quantum corrections to the system .",
    "one difficulty with this approach is that the coupling strength of monopole configurations is large due to the dirac quantization condition @xcite which requires that there be an inverse relationship between electric and magnetic couplings .",
    "a perturbatively small electric coupling requires a non - perturbatively large magnetic coupling .",
    "the perturbative quantization techniques do not work well with monopoles for the same reason that they have trouble with qcd in the low energy regime : the couplings are non - perturbatively large .",
    "numerical simulations in lattice qcd show that the configurations of gauge fields with monopoles dominate in the path integral , _",
    "i.e. _ monopole configurations are important contributors to the qcd string tension .",
    "thus the expectation value of any physical quantity @xmath2 in non - abelian gauge theory can be accurately calculated ( see for review ref .",
    "@xcite ) in terms of the monopole currents extracted from the projected abelian fields .",
    "magnetic monopoles necessarily emerge as relevant degrees of freedom in the abelian projections of lattice gluodynamics . in this paper",
    "we present a specific picture of how such magnetic monopole configurations can emerge and dominate the qcd path integral .",
    "we start with spherically symmetric classical solutions to the su(2 ) field equations .",
    "these solutions have a divergent energy density .",
    "however in constrast to the wu - yang monopole solutions , which are divergent due to fields that blow up at @xmath3 , our solutions are divergent due to fields which blow up at @xmath4 .",
    "these divergent solutions are parameterized by two ansatz functions .",
    "one of the ansatz functions smoothly and monotonically diverges at @xmath5 while the other functions strongly oscillates . applying a modified variant of a non - perturbative quantization method originally used by heisenberg @xcite @xcite",
    ", we find that the quantized version of our divergent classical solution becomes well behaved : the divergent ansatz function now goes to @xmath6 at @xmath5 , and the rapid ocsillations of the other ansatz function are `` smoothed '' out . rather than quantizing an su(2 )",
    "field configuration which is monopole - like already at the classical level , we quantized ( using heisenberg s method ) a non - monopole configuration , which has fields and an energy density which diverge at spacial infinity ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "after quantization this classically divergent solution becomes physically well behaved , and its asymptotic magnetic field becomes monopole - like .",
    "this may indicate that monopoles are inherently quantum objects : rather than quantizing a configuration which is monopole - like at the classical level , real monopoles might arise as a consequence of quantizing non - monopole classical solutions .",
    "in this section we will briefly review the classical , spherically symmetric , su(2 ) yang - mills theory solutions to which we will apply the modified heisenberg quantization method .",
    "we begin with the following ansatz for pure su(2 ) yang - mills theory @xmath7 \\label{s1 - 2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath8 is a color index ; the latin indices @xmath9 are space indices .",
    "this is the wu - yang ansatz @xcite .    under this ansatz",
    "the yang - mills equations ( @xmath10 ) become @xmath11 where the primes indicate differentiation with respect to @xmath12 . in the asymptotic limit @xmath0 the general solution to eqs . , approaches the form @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a dimensionless radius and @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are constants .",
    "the plot of these functions are presented on the fig.[fig1 ] , [ fig2 ] .",
    "the numerical study of eqs .",
    ", showed that the approximate form of the solution in eqs . - was a good representation even for @xmath12 close to the origin .",
    "these solutions can be compared with the certain confining potentials used in phenomenological studies of quarkonia bound states @xcite .",
    "it is possible to find analytic solutions with increasing gauge potentials , similar to the above numerical solution for the ansatz @xmath17 , if one couples the yang - mills fields to a scalar field @xcite .",
    "however , it is the increasing of @xmath18 that leads to the field energy and action of this solution diverging as @xmath0 .",
    "the `` magnetic '' ( @xmath19 ) and `` electric '' ( @xmath20 ) fields associated with this solution can be found from the non - abelian gauge potentials , @xmath21 , and have the following behavior @xmath22",
    "our su(2 ) gauge potential can be written as @xmath23     \\left\\ {      \\sin\\varphi ; -\\cos\\varphi ; 0    \\right\\ } , \\label{sec3 - 1}\\\\    a^q_\\varphi & = & \\left[1 - f(r)\\right ] \\sin\\theta    \\left\\ {      \\cos\\theta \\cos\\varphi ; \\cos\\theta \\sin\\varphi ;       -\\sin\\theta    \\right\\ } , \\label{sec3 - 2}\\\\    a^a_t & = & \\frac{g(r)}{r }    \\left\\ {      \\sin\\theta \\cos\\varphi ; \\sin\\theta \\sin\\varphi ; \\cos\\theta    \\right\\}. \\label{sec3 - 3 }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the gauge transformation @xmath24 with the matrix @xmath25 leads to the following result @xmath26 in this form we see that if @xmath27 as @xmath0 then only the first term in eq .",

    "@xcite ) that the u(1 ) diagonal components of the non - abelian gauge field are the most important for confinement , one tries to make a gauge choice which minimizes or excludes the off - diagonal components of the gauge potential ( _ i.e. _ the cartan subalgebra ) . for example ,",

    "lattice calculations ( for review , see for example , @xcite ) indicate that monopole - like gauge field configurations are dominate in the path integral . here",
    "we show that one can reach this same conclusion by using a variant of heisenberg s quantization method on non - monopole , classical solution . by quantizing the non - abelian we find that @xmath27 as @xmath0 .",
    "thus the quantized non - abelian fields asymptotically appear as monopoles .",
    "although the confining behavior of these classical solutions is interesting due to their similarity with certain phenomenological , confining potentials , the infinite field energy makes their physical importance / meaning uncertain .",
    "one possible resolution to the divergent field energy is if quantum effects removed the bad long distance behavior .",
    "the difficulty is that strongly interacting , nonlinear theories are notoriously hard to quantize . in order to take into account the quantum effects on these solutions",
    "we will employ a variation of the method used by heisenberg @xcite in attempts to quantize the nonlinear dirac equation .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that the gorkov s equations ( and consequently the ginzburg - landau equations ) in superconductivity theory is the direct application of heisenberg s idea for quantization of cooper pairs in the superconductor .",

    "this effectively turned the infinite set of coupled equations into a finite set of coupled equations .",
    "for the su(2 ) yang - mills theory this idea leads to the following yang - mills equations for the quantized su(2 ) gauge field @xmath49 here @xmath50 is the field _ operator _ of the su(2 )",

    "are given in terms of an infinite number of higher order , loop diagrams .",
    "in practice one takes only a finite number of diagrams into account when calculating the quantum correction to some physical quantity .",
    "this standard diagrammatic method requires a small expansion parameter ( the coupling constant ) , and thus does not work for strongly coupled theories .",
    "the heisenberg method was intended for strongly coupled , nonlinear theories , and we will apply a variation of this method to the classical solution discussed in the last section .    we will consider a variation of heisenberg s quantization method for the present non - abelian equations by making the following assumptions @xcite :    1 .",
    "the physical degrees of freedom relevant for studying the above classical solution ( which after quantization will be spherically symmetric excitations in qcd vacuum ) are given entirely by the two ansatz functions @xmath51 appearing in eqs .",
    "no other degrees of freedom will arise through the quantization process .",
    "2 .   from eqs .",
    ", we see that one function @xmath52 is a smoothly varying function for large @xmath12 , while another function , @xmath18 , is strongly oscillating .",
    "thus we take @xmath18 to be an almost classical degree of freedom while @xmath52 is treated as a fully quantum mechanical degree of freedom .",
    "naively one might expect that only the behavior of second function would change while the first function stayed the same . however since both functions are interrelated through the nonlinear nature of the field equations we find that both functions are modified .    to begin we replace the ansatz functions by operators @xmath53 .",
    "@xmath54 these equations can be seen as an approximation of the quantized su(2 ) yang - mills field equations .",
    "taking into account assumption ( 2 ) we let @xmath55 so that it becomes just a classical function again , and replace @xmath56 in eq . by its expectation value to arrive at @xmath57 where the expectation value @xmath58 is taken with respect to some quantum state @xmath59  @xmath60 .",
    "we can average eq . to get @xmath61 eqs .",

    "when one considers the euclidean version of the path integral above the exponential factor in becomes @xmath78 $ ] which for an infinite action would naively imply that this classical configuration would not contribute to the path integral at all .",
    "however , there are examples where infinite action , classical solutions have been hypothesized to play a significant role in the path integral .",
    "the most well known example of this is the meron solution @xcite , which has an infinite action . analytically the singularities of the meron solutions can be dealt with by replacing the regions that contain the singularities by instanton solutions .",
    "since instanton solutions have finite action this patched together solution of meron plus instanton has finite action .",
    "the drawback is that the yang - mills field equations are not satisfied at the boundary where the meron and instanton solutions are `` sewn '' together .",
    "in addition recent lattice studies @xcite @xcite have indicated that merons ( or the patched meron / instanton ) do play a role in the path integral . here",
    "we will treat this divergence in the action in an approximate way through a redefinition of the path integral integration measure .",
    "we now define the path integral by the following approximate way @xmath79 } da^a_\\mu      \\approx     \\frac {    \\int \\left ( \\tilde a^a_\\mu ( r ) \\right)_{cl }    e^{-i\\int l\\left [ \\left ( \\tilde a^a_\\mu ( r ) \\right)_{cl }       \\right ] dv }    d \\left ( \\tilde a^a_\\mu ( r ) \\right)_{cl }    }    { \\int e^{-i \\int l\\left [ \\left ( \\tilde a^a_\\mu ( r ) \\right)_{cl }       \\right ] dv }    d \\left ( \\tilde a^a_\\mu ( r ) \\right)_{cl }    } \\label{av-2b}\\ ] ] where @xmath80 is the 3d infinitesimal volume . here",
    "our basic assumption is that in the first rough approximation @xmath81 can be approximately estimated by integration over classical singular solutions .",
    "every such solution is labelled by @xmath82 and consequently we should integrate over phase @xmath82 .",
    "it can be shown that the lagrangian for the system is @xmath83    \\right\\ } r^{2\\alpha}. \\label{av-3a}\\ ] ] the next our assumption is that we neglect the oscillating term @xmath84 $ ] and factor @xmath85 is cancelled in numerator and denominator .",
    "that leads to @xmath86 here the measure @xmath87 . using this and the fact that @xmath88 we calculate the expectation value of various powers of @xmath52 @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the function from the eq .. the path integral _ inspired _ eqns",

    ", we find that eq . is satisfied identically and eq . takes the form @xmath91 which has the solutions @xmath92 where @xmath93 is some constant .",
    "the first solution is simply the classically averaged singular solution which still has the bad asymptotic divergence of the fields and energy density .",
    "the second solution , , is more physically relevant since it leads to asymptotic fields which are well behaved .",
    "the solution of eq . implies the following important result : * _ the quantum fluctuations of the strongly oscillating , nonlinear fields leads to an improvement of the bad asymptotic behavior of these nonlinear fields .",
    "_ * after quantization the monotonically growing and strongly oscillating components of the gauge potential became asymptotically well behaved .",
    "we interpret this spherically symmetric quantized field distribution * as a model of the monopole excitations in qcd vacuum . *    as @xmath0",
    "we find the following su(2 ) color fields @xmath94 we can see that as @xmath0 @xmath95 .",
    "in particular at infinity we find only a monopole `` magnetic '' field @xmath96 with a `` magnetic '' charge @xmath97 .",
    "this result can be summarized as : * _ the approximate quantization of the su(2 ) gauge field ( by averaging over the classical singular solutions ) gives a monopole - like configuration from an initial classical configuration which was not monopole - like .",
    "_ * we will call this a * _ `` quantum monopole '' _ * to distinguish it from field configurations which are monopole - like already in the classical theory .",
    "the divergence of the fields of the classical solution given by eqs . - leads to a diverging energy density for the solution , and thus an infinite total field energy .",
    "the energy density @xmath98 of the quantized solution is @xmath99 the first two terms on the right hand side of eq . , which involve the `` classical '' ansatz function @xmath18 ,",
    "go to zero faster than @xmath100 as @xmath0 due to the form of @xmath18 in eq . .",
    "thus the leading behavior of @xmath98 is given by the last two terms in eq .",

    "let us consider @xmath102 in the limit @xmath103 we have @xmath104 from eqs .",
    "and we see that @xmath105 which implies @xmath106 thus the third term in gives the leading asymptotic behavior as @xmath0 to be @xmath107 and the total energy of this `` quantum monopole '' ( excitation ) is infinite .",
    "this fact indicates that our approximation is good only for @xmath108 calculations but not for the derivative @xmath109 .",
    "starting from an infinite energy , classical solution to the su(2 ) yang - mills field equations we found that the bad asymptotic behavior of this solution was favorably modified by a variation of the quantization method proposed by heisenberg to deal with strongly coupled , nonlinear field theories .",
    "in addition , although the original classical solution was not monopole - like , it was found that the quantized solution was monopole - like .",
    "one possible application of this is to the dual - superconductor picture of the qcd vacuum . in this picture",
    "one models the qcd vacuum as a stochastic gas of appearing / disappearing monopoles and antimonopoles as in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "these monopole / antimonopole fluctuations can form pairs ( analogous to cooper pairs in real superconductors ) which can bose condense leading to a dual meissner effect @xcite @xcite expelling color electric flux from the qcd vacuum , expect in narrow flux tubes which connect and confine the quarks .",
    "lattice calculations confirm such a model @xcite : monopoles appear to play a major role in the qcd lattice gauge path integral .",
    "based on the results of the present paper it may be that : ( a ) the monopoles which are considered in the dual superconductor qcd vacuum picture and ( b ) the monopoles in lattice simulations whose location is determined by the abelian projection procedure should be the `` quantum '' monopoles discussed here .",
