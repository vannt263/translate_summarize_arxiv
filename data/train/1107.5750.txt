    "nasa s _ kepler _  mission is a space - based photometric telescope dedicated to finding earth - size planets in the habitable zones of their host stars and to determining the frequency and characteristics of planetary systems around sun - like stars @xcite .",
    "while monitoring nearly continuously the brightness of about 150,000 dwarf stars since may 2009 to achieve the above goals , it accumulates an extraordinary volume of data allowing atmospheric studies of the transiting hot - jupiters present in the field of view @xcite .",
    "the first four months of observations were released and 1235 transiting planet candidates were reported @xcite . because of their short periods and relatively deep transit depths , several hot - jupiter candidates were discovered early on during the first weeks of the mission . amongst those ,",

    "light emitted from exoplanets was first detected from space at infrared wavelengths @xcite and more recently in the optical @xcite using the _ corot _  and _ kepler _  _ space telescopes_. notably , @xcite used the _ microvariablity and oscillations of stars _ ( _ most _ ) telescope to place a very stringent upper limit on the depth of the occultation of hd  209458b .    the hot - jupiters detected by _",
    "corot _  and _ kepler _  are particularly good targets for studying planetary atmospheres , because the precise and nearly uninterrupted photometric surveillance provided by the space satellites can allow the planetary occultations to be detected at optical wavelengths @xcite .",
    "obtaining multiple wavelength observations of the relative depths of planetary occultations is necessary to constrain the broad band emergent spectra .",
    "such observations are fundamental to understanding the energy budget of these objects @xcite and for comparative exoplanetology .",
    "we confirm here the planetary status of koi-203 , designating it as kepler-17b , and study its atmosphere .",
    "we first describe the _ kepler _",
    "observations and transit modeling as well as the follow - up observations used to confirm this planet , including an orbital solution using radial velocities obtained with the _ high resolution spectrometer _ ( hrs ) at the _ hobby - eberly telescope _ ( het ) .",
    "we then study the impact of the stellar variability on the transit lightcurves and we use occulted dark starspots to constrain the stellar obliquity .",
    "we finally combine occultation measurements obtained in the optical with _ kepler _  and in the infrared with _ spitzer _  to learn about the atmospheric properties of kepler-17b .",

    "the spectrum was extracted and rectified to intensity vs. wavelength using standard procedures described by @xcite .",
    "the extracted spectrum has a signal - to - noise ratio of 17.5 per resolution element .",
    "we performed cross - correlations against a grid of synthetic stellar spectra , calculated by john laird for a grid of kurucz model atmospheres @xcite , using a line list developed by jon morse .",
    "the grid is coarse  250 k in effective temperature , @xmath3 ; 0.5 in log surface gravity , @xmath23 ; 0.5 in log of the metallicity compared to the sun , [ m / h ] ; and 2 km s-1 in rotational velocity , @xmath24   so rather than simply adopting the parameters from the template with the best correlation coefficient , we fit a surface to the correlation peak heights to arrive at a refined classification . however , given the degeneracies between @xmath3 , @xmath23 , and [ m / h ] , the quality of the spectrum is not sufficient to determine all three at once .",
    "as such , we have fixed @xmath25 as inferred from the best - fit of the kepler photometry .",
    "the analysis yields @xmath3=@xmath4  k , [ m / h]=@xmath26 , @xmath27  @xmath28 .",
    "when corrected for the orbital motion of kepler-17  and the tres zero point offset , determined by long - term monitoring of the iau rv standard hd  182488 , we find the absolute mean systemic velocity of kepler-17  to be @xmath29  @xmath28 .",
    "note that this does not include any uncertainty in the absolute velocity of hd  182488 , which we take to be -21.508",
    "@xmath28 , as observed by @xcite .",
    "we also obtained keck hires spectra and estimated the line strengths of @xmath30=@xmath31  and @xmath32=@xmath33 for kepler-17  ( assuming b - v=0.82 ) .",
    "the h & k  line strengths are a good indicator of the stellar activity @xcite .",
    "the astrometry derived from the _ kepler _ images themselves , when combined with high - resolution images of the target neighborhood , provides a very powerful tool for identifying background eclipsing binaries blended with and contaminating the target images @xcite .",
    "the astrometry of kepler-17  indicated no significant offset during transits in any quarter , and computed offsets are well within the formal 3-sigma radius of confusion .",
    "therefore kepler-17  is considered to be the source for the transits observed in the _ kepler _  lightcurves .",
    "we obtained an i - band image at the lick observatory 1-meter , nickel telescope with the direct imaging camera ( see figure  [ fig : image ] ) .",
    "the 1.0 `` arc - second seeing revealed no companions from 2 '' to 5 \" from the star s center , down to a limit of 19th magnitude .",
    "similar conclusion were reached using ukirt j - band images ( figure  [ fig : image ] ) .",
    "we obtained precise radial velocity ( rv ) follow - up observations of kepler-17  with the het ( ramsey et al .",
    "1998 ) and its hrs spectrograph @xcite at mcdonald observatory .",
    "kepler-17  was observed ten times in the 2010 observing season , from 2010 august 22 until 2010 november 22 .",
    "the instrumental setup and observing mode are described in more detail in @xcite .",
    "kepler-17b  is the second planet confirmed with het after kepler-15b @xcite .",
    "we employed a `` snap shot '' strategy , using relatively short exposures of 1200 seconds , that yield a snr sufficient to detect the radial - velocity signal of a hot - jupiter .",
    "thirteen spectra were taken with the i@xmath34-cell in the light path to compute precise differential rvs .",
    "these spectra have a typical s / n - ratio of @xmath35 per resolution element .",
    "the radial velocity data are listed in table  [ tab : rvs ] .",
    "we use _ gaussfit _ , the generalized least - squares software of @xcite to fit a keplerian orbit to the hrs radial velocity data . only the velocity zero - point and the radial velocity semi - amplitude @xmath36",
    "are included as free parameters in the fitting process .",
    "we first fitted the radial - velocity data alone , requiring the orbit to be circular ( @xmath37 ) and adopting the ephemeris derived from the _ kepler _  photometry .",
    "the best - fit orbit has a @xmath36 of @xmath38ms@xmath39 , a @xmath40 of @xmath41 and a residual rms scatter around the fit of 52  ms@xmath39 .",
    "the radial velocity data and the orbital solution are shown in figure  [ fig : rvs ] .",
    "we determined the spectral line bisectors , which are a measure of line asymmetry , from the het spectra to test if the radial velocity variations could be caused by distortions in the spectral line profiles due to contamination from a nearby unresolved eclipsing binary .",
    "we can only use a small fraction of the available spectral range that is not contaminated by the iodine absorption cell ( 50006400 angstrom ) and thus the uncertainties in the bisector velocity span ( bvs ) are quite large with an average uncertainty of 99  ms@xmath39 .",
    "the rms of the bisector measurements is 146  ms@xmath39 .",
    "there is no evidence of a correlation between the velocities and the bisectors , which supports the interpretation that the velocity variations are due to a planetary companion ( e.g. @xcite )",
    "we derive the mass , radius , and age of the host star using the method described by @xcite .",
    "we first created a set of stellar evolution models from the yonsei - yale ( y@xmath42 ) series by @xcite , with corrections from @xcite .",
    "we employed their interpolation software which accepts as inputs the age of the star , the iron abundance , and the abundance of @xmath43-elements ( relative to solar ) for which we assume the solar value , and outputs a grid of stellar isochrones corresponding to a range of masses .",
    "we evaluated a set of isochrones at ages from 0.1 to 14 gyr ( at intervals of 0.1 gyr ) and stellar metallicities spanning a range of @xmath44 ( at intervals of 0.01 dex ) from the best - fit metallicity derived from spectra of [ fe / h]=@xmath26 .",
    "we then performed a spline interpolation of each output table at a resolution of 0.005 in effective temperature @xmath3 , the log of the surface gravity log@xmath45 , and the stellar luminosity @xmath46 .",
    "we evaluated the physical radius corresponding to each stellar model via log@xmath45 and the mass of the star , though it is also possible to convert to physical radius using the model stellar luminosity and effective temperature ( assuming @xmath47 ) ; in practice these conversions give identical results .",
    "we fitted for the stellar mass and radius using newton s version of kepler s third law in the manner employed by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we assumed that the planetary mass is negligible when compared to the mass of the host star . using the markov chain monte carlo sequence of @xmath48 , and generating a series of gaussian random realizations of [ fe / h ]  and @xmath3  using the values and error bars derived from spectroscopy of @xmath3=@xmath4  k and [ fe / h]=@xmath26 , respectively , we located the best isochrone fit at each realization using the @xmath49 goodness - of - fit given in equation [ eq : chisquared ] .",
    "@xmath50}{\\sigma_{\\mbox{[fe / h]}}}\\right)^{2 } , \\label{eq : chisquared}\\ ] ]    using the output of the mcmc chain of @xmath48 ensures that any correlations between parameters , which are reflected in the chain , are properly incorporated into our estimate of the stellar parameters .",
    "we then assign a weight to the likelihood of each stellar model in the chain , applying a prior for the initial mass function ( imf ) which assumes a salpeter index .",
    "the number of stars of each mass and age , per 1000 stars , is generated by the interpolation software provided by @xcite for several imf assumptions , including the salpeter imf .",
    "we designate the weight assigned to each stellar model in the chain by normalizing to the highest imf value within the sample ; in practice , the weights vary from 0.3 to 1 ( from the least to most likely ) .",
    "the imf prior changes the final answer by less than half a @xmath51 for all parameters .",
    "we then incorporate this likelihood by discarding members of the chain according to their weight , where the weight is equal to the likelihood of remaining sampling ; about 40% of the original chain remains intact after this stage .",
    "the value for each stellar parameter is then assigned from the median of this weighted distribution , with the error bars assigned from the nearest @xmath52 of values . in this way",
    ", we find @xmath53= @xmath54 @xmath55 , @xmath56= 1.019 @xmath57 0.014 @xmath58 , and an age = @xmath59 gyr .",
    "these uncertainties are statistical as they exclude possible systematic uncertainties in the stellar models .",
    "the best - fit solution is presented in figure  [ fig : isochrone ] .",
    "we caution that stellar isochrones are only poorly constrained for this faint star .",
    "the estimated error bars on the stellar parameters are smaller than what is expected for such a star of this magnitude .",
    "this is because we set the stellar gravity as a fixed value in our analysis , since the stellar spectrum has a low signal - to - noise .",
    "we set the stellar gravity to the value we derive from the stellar density measured using the _ kepler _  photometry ( see section  [ sec : recon ] ) .",
    "the quality of the combined transit lightcurve allows us to measure the stellar density with a high precision that tightly constrains the isochrone fits ( see figure  [ fig : isochrone ] ) .",
    "however , a recent study of the physical properties of the stellar components of the transiting exoplanets by @xcite shows that the current stellar models are not determined at better than 1% in terms of radius and 2% in mass ( median values ) ; more conservatives values are 3 and 5% for the stellar radius and mass respectively .",
    "we adopt these conservatives values and propagate the systematic errors arising from the dependence on stellar theory to the final errors . adding the statistical and systematical error quadratically , we find @xmath53= @xmath60 @xmath55 , @xmath56= 1.019 @xmath57 0.03 @xmath58 .",
    "this study shows that kepler-17  is consistent with a main - sequence @xmath61 dwarf star , its radius and @xmath3  are indistinguishable from solar .",
    "the first method we use to measure the occultations from the _ kepler _  observations is described by @xcite .",
    "we search for the occultation events in the short cadence light curves .",
    "we normalize and combine 173 occultations events . the best - fit and the maximum depth as a function of the orbital phase",
    "are found very close to the orbital phase of @xmath62 as expected for a circular orbit .",
    "we estimate the significance of this detection by measuring the occultation depth , ephemeris and associated errors using a bootstrap monte - carlo analysis .",
    "we find that the planet has an occultation depth of @xmath63  ppm .    in a second method",
    ", we include the occultations in a markov chain monte carlo global analysis as described below in the section  [ sec : mcmc ] .",
    "we present the normalized , folded , combined and binned per 15 min light curve obtained at long cadence in figure  [ fig : keplerecllc ] from which we measure the occultation depth with the mcmc .",
    "the method we use to measure the occultations from the _ spitzer _",
    "observations is described in @xcite .",
    "kepler-17  was observed during four occultations between august 2010 and january 2011 with _ warm - spitzer_/irac @xcite at 3.6 and 4.5  ( program i d 60028 ) .",
    "two occultations were gathered per bandpass and each visit lasted approximately 8.6  h. the data were obtained in full - frame mode ( @xmath64 pixels ) with an exposure time of 30.0  s per image and yielded 2461 images per visit .",
    "the method we use to produce photometric time series from the images is described in @xcite .",
    "it consists of finding the centroid position of the stellar point spread function ( psf ) and performing aperture photometry using a circular aperture on individual basic calibrated data ( bcd ) images delivered by the _",
    "spitzer _ archive .",
    "the optimal apertures were found to be @xmath65  pixels in radius .",
    "the final photometric measurements used are presented in table  [ tab : spitzer ] .",
    "the raw time series are presented in the top panels of figure  [ fig : spitzerlc ] .",
    "telescope pointing drift results in fluctuations of the stellar centroid position , which , in combination with intra - pixel sensitivity variations , produces systematic noise in the raw light curves ( upper panel figure  [ fig : spitzerlc ] ) .",
    "a description of this effect , known as the pixel - phase effect , is given in the _",
    "spitzer_/irac data handbook @xcite and is well known in exoplanetary studies ( e.g. @xcite ) . to correct the light curve ,",
    "we define a baseline function that is the sum of a linear function of time and a quadratic function ( with four parameters ) of the x and y centroid positions .",
    "we find that the point - to - point scatter in the photometry gives a typical signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath66 ) @xmath67 and @xmath68 per image at 3.6 and 4.5  respectively .",
    "these correspond to 85% of the theoretical signal - to - noise .",
    "we simultaneously fit the instrumental functions with all the parameters , measured the occultation depths for each individual visit , and report report the values in table  [ tab : spitzer ] .",
    "the measurements per bandpass agree at the 1-@xmath51 level .",
    "the weighted mean of the transit depths are @xmath69% and @xmath70% at 3.6 and 4.5  respectively .",
    "we also included the _",
    "spitzer _",
    "observations in the global mcmc analysis described below .",
    "the analysis of the _ kepler _  photometry and the determination of the stellar and planetary parameters for kepler-17  follows procedures similar to those reported in @xcite .",
    "we check and confirm these results by an independent analysis with the global markov chain monte - carlo ( mcmc ) algorithm presented in @xcite .",
    "this mcmc implementation uses the metropolis - hasting algorithm to perform the sampling .",
    "input data to the mcmc include the _ kepler _  and _ spitzer _  photometric measurements and the radial - velocity data .",
    "_ kepler _ short cadence ( sc ) data allow a precise determination of the transit parameters and more specifically allow a fit for the limb - darkening ( ld ) coefficients .",
    "we therefore assumed a quadratic law and used @xmath71 and @xmath72 as jump parameters , where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the quadratic coefficients .",
    "those linear combinations help in minimizing correlations on the uncertainties of @xmath73 and @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "the mcmc has the following set of 13 jump parameters : the planet - to - star flux ratios in the _ kepler _  and _ spitzer _  bandpasses , the transit depth , the impact parameter @xmath75 , the transit duration from first to fourth contact , the time of minimum light , the orbital period , @xmath76 , where @xmath36 is the radial - velocity semi - amplitude , the two ld combinations @xmath77 and @xmath78 and the two parameters @xmath79 and @xmath80 @xcite .",
    "a uniform prior distribution is assumed for all jump parameters .",
    "baseline model coefficients are determined for each lightcurve with the svd method @xcite at each step of the mcmc",
    ". correlated noise is accounted for following @xcite and @xcite , to ensure reliable error bars on the fitted parameters . for this purpose ,",
    "we compute a scaling factor based on the standard deviation of the binned residuals for each lightcurve with different time bins .",
    "the error bars are then multiplied by this scaling factor .",
    "we obtained a mean scaling factor of 1.19 for all photometry .",
    "the results from the mcmc analysis are presented in table  [ tab : param ]",
    "adopting the stellar mass and radius for kepler-17  that we found in section  [ sec : stellar ] , we obtain a mass of @xmath9 and a radius of @xmath10 for the planet , which leads to a density of @xmath81 , and a surface gravity @xmath82 ( cgs ) .",
    "we note that the surface gravity can be derived from the photometry and the velocimetry only @xcite .",
    "the position of kepler-17b  on the mass / radius diagram is fairly common and it appears to be slightly inflated compared to models that include the effects of stellar irradiation ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the current upper limit on the orbital eccentricity @xmath12 from radial velocity measurements is consistent with zero for kepler-17b .",
    "we also measure the mid - occultation timing offset from both _ kepler _  and _ spitzer",
    "_  observations .",
    "the determination of the timing of the secondary eclipse constrains the planet s orbital eccentricity .",
    "our estimate for the best - fit timing offset translates to a constraint on @xmath12 and the argument of pericenter @xmath83 .",
    "the timing is used to constrain the @xmath84 and we find that @xmath85 at the @xmath86 level .",
    "this upper limit implies that the orbits of these objects are nearly circular unless the line of sight is aligned with the planet s major orbital axis , i.e. the argument of periapse @xmath83 is close to 90  or 270 .",
    "we fit a linear function of transit epoch and find @xmath87 ( bjd@xmath88 ) with a period @xmath89 days .",
    "we also fit each mid - transit time individually and compare each one to the expected linear ephemeris to obtain a observed - minus - computed ( o - c ) time series .",
    "the o - c times shows a scatter that is most probably caused by stellar spot - induced shifts , since the star is active ( see section  [ starvar ] ) .",
    "formally , the individual fits are consistent with the linear model , therefore we do not consider this to be a significant detection of timing anomalies .",
    "since there is no clear evidence for transit timing variations ( ttvs ; @xcite ) , we use the timing data to place upper limits on the mass of a hypothetical second planet that would perturb the orbit of the transiting planet using the procedure described in @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : ttvs ] shows the constraints on the perturber mass as a function of period ratio , as determined from this analysis .",
    "the mass constraints on the perturber are more restrictive near the mean - motion resonances and most restrictive at the low - order resonances , particularly for the interior and exterior 2:1 resonances . for example",
    ", a perturber at the interior 2:1 resonance having a mass near that of mars would have induced ttvs detectable in the present data .",
    "the _ kepler _  photometry exhibits a quasi periodic flux modulation of about @xmath90 with a period of 11.9  days ( figure  [ fig : rawtlc ] ) .",
    "this period corresponds to 8 times the planet s orbital period ( figure  [ fig : stellarcycle ] ) .",
    "the stellar variability can be quantified from a lomb - scargle periodogram that reveals two peaks at 5.95 and 11.9 days ( see figure  [ fig : ls ] ) .",
    "the position of the peak on the periodogram and its width provide a measurement of the stellar rotation period and its error , respectively .",
    "we measured a stelllar rotation period of @xmath91  days .",
    "the presence of active stellar spots localized on opposite hemispheres can best explain the two peaks seen in the periodogram .",
    "we find that the ratio between the planet s orbital period and the stellar rotation period is @xmath92  days .",
    "we note that this intriguing integer ratio of 8 could potentially reveal the signature of stellar - planet interactions .",
    "the lightcurve of kepler-17  shows substantial deformation of the planet s transit profiles which we interpret as occultations of dark starspots ( figure  [ fig : keplerlc ] ) .",
    "we co - added the transit lightcurves that occurred at epochs modulo the stellar rotation period ( modulo 8 planetary orbital periods ) .",
    "we present the resulting 8 transit lightcurves in figure  [ fig : spotseq ] ; each contains about 22 individual transit lightcurves .",
    "we identified that the planet crosses spots of identical shapes every 8 transits producing a _ stroboscopic _ effect .",
    "therefore , we conclude that starspots come back to the same position on the transit chord after 8 orbits or 11.89 days ( one stellar rotation period ) .",
    "because of this stroboscopic effect , the scatter measured during the spot - crossing phase of each of these lightcurve residuals is similar to the scatter of the residuals measured outside the transit .",
    "this further supports the assertion that the same spots are crossed by the planet every 8 transits , at identical orbital phases , because the residuals measured from a transit light curve obtained from a planet occulting a random distribution of spots are expected to be larger during the transit event compared to the out - of - transit monitoring .",
    "this can be explained only if spots are coming back to similar longitudes and latitudes after one stellar rotation period .",
    "interestingly , occulted stellar spots can place constraints on the spin - orbit alignment ( e.g @xcite ) .",
    "we identified five spots ( a , b , c , d and e ) by their anomaly in the residuals and we marked their initial orbital phase positions as seen in figure  [ fig : spotseq ] .",
    "we then computed the expected phase position of each of these 5 anomalies on the 8 following lightcurve residuals assuming that occulted starspots should have moved by @xmath93 in longitude towards the egress ( for a prograde and aligned orbit ) for every planetary transit .",
    "we find that anomalies are always present at all the expected phases .",
    "as the star rotates , the spot surfaces projected on the stellar sphere change ; therefore the shapes and amplitudes of these anomalies change between consecutive transits while the same spots are crossed over time .",
    "since a spot surface appears larger at the center of the star compared to the limb , the anomalies due to spots should exhibit larger amplitudes when they are crossed close to the mid - transit time .",
    "this is consistent with what is observed in kepler-17 .",
    "for example , anomaly ` b ' in figure  [ fig : spotseq ] is observed in four consecutive transits .",
    "the overall shape of this anolmaly is conserved transit after transit and its amplitude increases before and decreases after the mid - transit .",
    "these findings imply that the projected spin - orbit angle , @xmath94 , is very close to 0 for this system .",
    "because occulted spots can be identified transit after transit ( figure  [ fig : spots ] ) , with a change in phase expected from the stellar rotation period , we conclude that the stellar inclination angle is near 90 degrees .",
    "this is further supported by the measured @xmath27  km / s which is in good agreement with its expected value of @xmath95  km / s assuming an inclination angle of 90 degrees .",
    "this implies that the true obliquity , i.e. the angle between the stellar rotational axis and a line perpendicular to planet s orbital plane , @xmath96 , must be close to 0 .",
    "finally , we conclude that the planet orbit is prograde since the occulted starspots progress from the transit ingress to the egress limbs .",
    "assuming that the uncertainty on latitude of a spot corresponds to the planet size , we derive an uncertainty for @xmath96 of @xmath97 . we note that the spot size could be larger than the planet size , but this changes the results only modestly . assuming a star spot twice the projected size of the planet on the stellar photosphere provides a more conservative uncertainty of @xmath98 for @xmath96 .",
    "@xcite show that stars with transiting planets for which the stellar obliquity is large are preferentially hot ( @xmath3@xmath99  k ) .",
    "the low obliquity of kepler-17b  fits this pattern since the stellar temperature is lower than 6250  k.      to help visualize the spot crossings during transit , we subtract the best - fit model from each individual transit and investigate the residuals .",
    "we slide a box of duration twice the ingress time across the residuals in each transit epoch , recording the scatter for a given box mid - time ( relative to mid - transit ) and a given epoch .",
    "we then produce an image of this scatter at orbital phase as a function of the epoch number ( see figure  [ fig : spots ] ) .",
    "we used an interpolation ( with idl s trigrid ) with an output sampling of 600 samples in the epochal direction and 300 samples in the transit phase direction .",
    "this image reveals individual spots that we define as either  hot \" or  cold \" regions , depending on whether the individual slide box residuals are below or above the transit light curve model .",
    "the repeating vertical structure is interpreted as spots marching across the transit chord such as seen in the previous section .",
    "each vertical profile is slanted slightly from left to right indicating that the spots progress from the ingress limb to the egress limb .",
    "some spots make their way around the star and reappear again during several stellar rotation periods . for example ,",
    "the collection of  cold \" spots in the image starting around epoch 110 and ending around epoch 170 seem to be related to the same spot .",
    "we conclude from the nearly continuous monitoring of kepler-17  that the occulted starspots are present on the same stellar chord for at least 100 days , somewhat comparable to the lifetime of sunspots .    as _ kepler",
    "_  continues to monitor transits of hot - jupiters in front of active stars , it will help to better understand the stellar cycles .",
    "if the _ kepler _  mission is extended , the long term photometry will enable it to produce star - spot maps and learn more about spot mean lifetimes and photospheric differential rotations .",
    "in the case of kepler-17 , we may be able to measure the complete activity cycle for this star and to compare it to another well - know g - dwarf : the sun .",
    "[ [ impact - of - stellar - variability - of - kepler-17on - the - system - parameters ] ] impact of stellar variability of kepler-17  on the system parameters ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    when the planet transits in front of stellar spots , its transit shape deviates from the averaged phase - folded lightcurve .",
    "the effect of occulted stellar spots on the shape of the transit lightcurve is observed in the residuals from the best - fit transit model of the phase - folded light curve ( see figure  [ fig : keplerlc ] ) .",
    "since the stellar activity influences the transit lightcurve profiles , the planetary parameters we derive from these profiles are likely to be affected .",
    "this is a well known problem for planets transiting in front of variable stars ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "importantly for the present study , the variability affects the stellar density that we assume a fixed value for our determination of the stellar parameters ( see section  [ sec : stellar ] ) . @xcite propose to fit the lower envelope of the transit lightcurve to recover more realistic transit parameters .",
    "this assumes that dark stellar structures dominate over bright faculae . in the case of kepler-17b",
    ", we can not exclude the possibility that every transit is affected by dark or bright stellar regions so that a priori no individual transit light curve can be used as representative of an unaffected profile .",
    "furthermore , because of the stroboscopic effect described above , the phase - folded transit lightcurve possesses combined pattern distortions that prevents the use of its lower envelope to derive more accurate parameters .",
    "we note that the combination of the residuals for the eight transit lightcurves presented in figure  [ fig : spotseq ] is very similar to the total residuals plotted in figure  [ fig : keplerlc ] and exhibits a symmetrical structure .",
    "this symmetrical pattern has a shape which is consistent with what would be expected from an oblate planet but with an amplitude ten to a hundred times larger than expected for a jupiter size planet @xcite .",
    "this pattern represents a remarkable coincidence , in that it seems quite symmetric but it is only obtained when all 8 time series are combined , and does not appear in the residuals for any single time series .",
    "the occultation depths measured in each bandpass are combined and turned into an emergent spectrum for the planet .",
    "the observed flux of the planet in each bandpass corresponds to the sum of the reflected light and the thermally emitted light .",
    "the combined occultation observed in the _ kepler _  bandpass provides a measure of the planet s geometric albedo .",
    "the occultation depth of @xmath100 ppm corresponds to @xmath101 . assuming a lambertian criterion @xmath102 , and assuming that the geometric albedo measured in the _ kepler _  bandpass is the same at every wavelength , we infer an upper limit to the bond albedo of @xmath103 at the 1-@xmath51 level .",
    "this result is conservative in the sense that the true albedo may be even lower , if some of the occultation signal we have measured in the _ kepler _  bandpass is due to thermal emission rather than reflected light .",
    "this is expected for the temperature regime of hot - jupiters .",
    "therefore , the bond albedo could be well below 0.18 .",
    "we estimate the thermal component of the planet s emission in the two _ spitzer _  band - passes from the occultation depths measured at 3.6 and 4.5  ( see table  [ tab : spitzer ] ) .",
    "we assume that the planetary emission is well reproduced by a black - body spectrum and translate the measured depth of the secondary eclipse into brightness temperatures .",
    "we use the phoenix atmospheric code @xcite to produce theoretical stellar models for the star kepler-17 .",
    "taking the _ spitzer _  spectral response function into account , the ratio of areas of the star and the planet and the stellar spectra , we derive the brightness temperatures that best - fit the observed eclipse depths measured in the two irac bandpasses .",
    "the brightness temperature calculated this way result in t@xmath14=@xmath104  k and t@xmath16=@xmath17  k.    we compare our data to the hot - jupiter atmospheric model described in @xcite which has been used for a variety of close - in planets @xcite .",
    "we aim at broadly distinguishing between different classes of model atmospheres , given that there are no prior constraints on the basic composition and structure .",
    "the atmospheric spectrum calculations are performed for 1d atmospheric pressure - temperature ( p - t ) profiles and use the equilibrium chemical abundances , at solar metallicity , described in @xcite .",
    "this is a self - consistent treatment of radiative transfer and chemical equilibrium of neutral species .",
    "the opacity database is described in @xcite .",
    "the models are calculated for various values of the dayside - to - nightside energy redistribution parameter ( @xmath105 ) and allow for the presence of tio at high altitude , which may play the role of an absorber and which likely lead to an inversion of the p - t profile .",
    "we compare the data to model predictions and select models with the best reduced .",
    "we note that this is not a fit involving adjustable parameters .",
    "all models shown assume redistribution of absorbed flux over the dayside only , favoring low values for @xmath105 .",
    "since our observations are only weakly constraining , the 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath106 m depth ratios are best fitted by a model without a temperature inversion , although the model with a temperature inversion is a reasonable fit as well . in the model with no inversion the optical opacity sources are neutral atomic na and k , while in the inverted model the optical opacity is dominated by gaseous tio and vo molecules . the relatively large occultation depth in the kepler bandpass is not matched by these simple models .",
    "this may indicate that silicate clouds ( as is seen in l - type brown dwarfs , but not modeled here ) may lead to a higher amount of scattered flux from the planet .",
    "it may also indicate that optical opacity sources are overestimated , such that more planetary thermal flux is being seen from deeper layers .",
    "the growing sample size of kepler occultation detections may show trends with planetary @xmath3  that could help to clarify this issue .",
    "@xcite shows that there is a correlation between the surface gravity of hot jupiters and the activity levels of the host stars , such that high surface gravity planets tend to be found around high - activity stars .",
    "the position of kepler-17b  on such a diagram is consistent with this trend .",
    "@xcite show that there could also be a correlation between the host star activity level and the thermal inversion of the planetary atmosphere . in this picture , the strong xeuv irradiation from the active stellar host of a hot - jupiter depletes the atmosphere of chemical species responsible for producing inversions .",
    "the @xmath32  of kepler-17  is consistent with the case of no thermal inversion in the framework developed by @xcite .",
    "we also evaluated the empirical index defined by @xcite , which could be correlated with the presence of a thermal inversion . using the same definition",
    ", we find indices of 0.026% above and 0.034% below the predicted black - body fluxes in the 3.6 and 4.5 micron bands .",
    "these indices suggest that the atmosphere of kepler-17b  is consistent with a non - inverted profile , which is in agreement with the results of our present study .",
