    "the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) has been used as a window through which to study not only the early universe but also its evolutionary history .",
    "the challenge of such observations arises from the fact that the cmb carries information spanning a period of about 14 billion years , so that specially - designed instruments and analysis methods are required to separate the effects originated from different physical processes .",
    "one recent focus is the measurement of the sunyaev - zeldovich effects ( sze ) resulting from the hot gas in galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "several cmb experiments are dedicated to this purpose , such as act @xcite , ami @xcite , apex - sz @xcite , ovro / bima - sze @xcite , spt @xcite , sza @xcite , and ocra - p @xcite . here",
    "we report the first results of sze observations with the y.  t.  lee array for microwave background anisotropy ( amiba ; * ? ? ?",
    "amiba is devoted to cmb observation with particular emphasis on detecting sze clusters , the cmb anisotropy , and possibly cosmic defects @xcite .",
    "the instrument is described in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . in our initial configuration with seven close - packed antennas of 60-cm diameter , we concentrated on pointed observations of the sze and the measurement of the cmb temperature power spectrum @xcite .    at the amiba operating frequency ( 86 - 102 ghz ; @xmath2-mm wavelength )",
    "the sze is expected to induce a decrement in cmb intensity as compared with the undistorted planckian spectrum ( see sec .",
    "[ sec - tel - sze ] ) .",
    "this provides a powerful tool for discriminating between galaxy clusters and other astronomical sources , because the latter normally emit photons characteristic of much harder spectra than the cmb , and therefore always induce an increment in intensity rather than a decrement . by measuring the sze intensity deficit and its profile , we hope to probe not only the cluster physics but also the related cosmic origins",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    "we describe the amiba telescope and its relation to the sze . in section  3 , we summarize our initial observations in 2007 with emphasis on the observing strategy and target selection . in section  4 , we describe our analysis formalism and procedures for obtaining the calibrated visibilities from the raw time - lag data , and the sze images and profiles from the calibrated visibilities .",
    "the main results are also presented here . in section  5",
    "we discuss possible systematic errors . in section  6",
    ", we summarize the scientific implications of these results , including the estimation of hubble constant @xcite , the scaling relationship between the sze and x - ary derived properties @xcite , and the baryonic fraction when our sze data are jointly analyzed with the subaru lensing data @xcite .",

    "amiba is an interferometric experiment initiated in taiwan in 2000 and dedicated on mauna - loa ( 3400  m in elevation ) , big island , hawaii on october 3 , 2006 .",
    "it has dual - channel receivers operating at 86102 ghz , designed to have full polarization capabilities @xcite .",
    "currently it has seven close - packed cassegrain antennas of 60-cm diameter @xcite giving a synthesized resolution of 6 arcminutes ( see sec .",
    "[ sec - res ] ) , expandable to a total of 19 elements with a synthesized resolution of about 2 arcminutes .",
    "the project has been funded for an expansion to 13 elements with dishes of 1.2-m diameter .",
    "the 13-element system is expected to start operating in the early 2009 .",
    "its capability in studying the sze science is investigated by @xcite .",
    "the receiver - antenna elements are reconfigurable and co - mounted on a six - meter platform , which is driven by a hexapod mount @xcite .",
    "each element has a cooled heterodyne receiver , consisting of hemt amplifiers of 46 db in amplification , subharmonic mixers , and 218 ghz if amplifiers . for each baseline , the signals from two dual - channel receivers are cross - correlated in an analogue 4-lag correlator , whose time - lag outputs are convertible to two complex visibilities corresponding to the upper and lower frequency bands ( see sec .  [ formalism ] ) .",
    "the cross correlation between the l and r polarization modes ( the dual channels ) of a pair of receivers enables the measurement of the four stokes parameters , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 .",
    "currently amiba operates with only two cross - polarization modes of ll and rr , focusing on the measurement of @xmath3 .",

    "therefore for a typical massive cluster with @xmath36 , @xmath37  kev , @xmath38 , @xmath39  km@xmath40s , and an angular size of @xmath41 , we expect the sze signals to be @xmath42  mjy and @xmath43  mjy for amiba , indicating @xmath44  % .",
    "the fractional contribution from the relativistic correction @xmath18 in such case is about 7  % .",
    "thus we expect the amiba sze signals to be dominated by the thermal effects , with a feature of decrement in flux density .",
    "we also note that @xmath45  jy  sr@xmath13 , so that @xmath46",
    ".    the operating frequency of @xmath35 $ ]  ghz also has the advantage that the sze signals are less affected by the point sources when compared with the observations at a lower frequency , which is more typical for interferometric experiments such as ami ( 15 ghz ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , sza ( 2735 ghz ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and ovro / bima ( 30 ghz ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is because typically the point sources have power - law spectra of flux density with negative spectral indices , so that they contribute less towards higher frequencies .",
    "we note that although sza also has instruments at 9098  ghz , their baselines are about ten times longer than ours providing information at much smaller angular scales that is complementary to what amiba can supply .",
    "another advantage of the amiba frequency range is that it also suppresses the galactic synchrotron radiation and dust emission .",
    "detailed investigation about the amiba foreground is presented in @xcite .",
    "these features in frequency and resolution make amiba a unique cmb telescope , complementing the capability of other cmb projects .",
    "before the 60-cm antennas were mounted onto the platform , their beam patterns were individually measured in the far field ( @xmath47  m ) by scanning a wide - band white source with a system retrofitted from a commercial equatorial mount @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig - beam](a ) shows an example .",
    "an azimuthal average of the beam pattern ( figure  [ fig - beam](b ) ) reveals a full - width - at - half - maximum ( fwhm ) of about 23 arcminutes .",
    "the first side lobe is about 20 db below the primary peak and the beam profile is as per designed .",
    "the index of asymmetry @xcite is calculated showing that the discrepancy of the beam pattern from its azimuthal average is below 10% within the fwhm .",
    "all beam patterns of the antennas are well fitted by a gaussian beam of 23 arcminutes within the 2-@xmath48 region for @xmath49 error .      in 2007 ,",
    "amiba was used with the seven 57.6-cm diameter antennas close - packed on the platform , providing 21 baselines of three different lengths @xmath50  cm , 105.0  cm , and 121.2  cm .",
    "each baseline operates at two frequency channels centered at @xmath51  and 98  ghz , each with a band width of 8  ghz .",
    "thus the three baseline lengths correspond to six multipole bands @xmath52 $ ] , @xmath53 $ ] , @xmath54 $ ] , @xmath55 $ ] , @xmath56 $ ] , @xmath57 $ ] .",
    "these baselines have a six - fold symmetry @xcite . to achieve better @xmath58-@xmath59 coverage and thus a better imaging capability , we observe each target at eight different polarization angles of the platform with an angular step of 7.5 degrees , uniformly covering azimuthal angles in the @xmath58-@xmath59 plane with 48  discrete samples for each of the three different baseline lengths at each of the two frequency bands .",
    "this makes a total of 288 discrete @xmath58-@xmath59 samples .",
    "figure  [ fig - uv_coverage ] shows such typical @xmath58-@xmath59 coverage , with the corresponding noise - weighted point spread function from a typical observation , the so - called ` dirty beam ' .",
    "the fwhm of the dirty beam is about 6  arcminutes , defining the synthesized resolution of the seven - element amiba .",
    "when using an equal - weighted ( rather than the current noise - weighted ) scheme to construct the dirty beam , we still obtain a similar resolution of about 6  arcminutes because the noise level for each baseline is about the same .      to minimize , if not completely remove , the effects from ground pickup and from a dc component in the electronics that leaks into the data , we adopt a ` two - patch ' observing strategy that alternates between the target and a region of nominally blank sky .",
    "this strategy is similar to that used by cbi for the measurement of cmb polarization @xcite .    in this mode , a leading patch that contains our target",
    "is tracked for three minutes , and then a trailing patch of the presumably blank sky is tracked for the same period of time .",
    "the trailing patch is located at an ra @xmath60 greater than the ra of the target .",
    "since it takes 10  seconds for the telescope to slew between the fields , the two patches are observed over identical azimuth and elevation tracks . during both tracks the platform polarization angle is controlled so that each baseline corresponds to a fixed @xmath58-@xmath59 mode .",
    "the recorded data during the two tracks should then contain the same contribution from ground pickup , which is removed by a subsequent differencing of the two tracks .",
    "this strategy requires that both the electronic offset and the ground emission are stable within 6 minutes , which is far shorter as compared with the measured time dependence @xcite .",
    "the penalty for adopting such a two - patch strategy is the loss of efficiency by a factor of @xmath61 , where a factor of 2 comes from doubling the observing time and the other factor of 2 from doubling the noise variance when differencing the two patches .",
    "we also note that there is a cmb component as well as possible combinations from galactic foreground and extragalactic point sources in the differencing map though at a level much lower than the expected sze of massive clusters @xcite . nevertheless before observations we did check our fields for such contaminations .",
    "figure  [ fig-2-patch ] demonstrates the application of the two - patch observing strategy for sze mapping .",
    "the left panel is an image constructed from the leading patch , containing cluster abell  2142 ( see sec .",
    "[ formalism ] for the formalism and procedure of data analysis ) .",
    "the middle panel shows the corresponding image from the trailing patch of blank sky .",
    "it is clear that both patches are contaminated by signals much stronger than the sze ( mainly from the ground pickup ) , and that the images are closely similar .",
    "the difference of the two patches reveals the cluster signal ( right panel ) , whose signal strength is only about 1% of the contamination signal in individual patches .      to calibrate these data , we observe planets roughly every 3 hours using the same 2-patch observing strategy .",
    "this time the two patches are each observed for four minutes and separated by @xmath62 in ra .",
    "such a separation in ra is equivalent to an angular separation of at least 57 arcminutes , assuring that leakage of the planetary signal into the second patch is small , less than @xmath63 of the planetary flux density according to the primary beam pattern measured in sec .",
    "[ primary - beam ] . the detailed formalism on how the data are converted to calibrated visibilities",
    "is presented in sec .",
    "[ calibration ] , and the determination of the planetary flux densities is discussed by @xcite .",
    "long - duration observations of the planets show that the system is stable at night ( between about 8 pm and 8 am ) so that a planetary calibration every three hours controls the calibration error to be within 5% in gain and 0.1 radian in phase @xcite .    to test the overall performance of our observing , calibration , and analysis strategy , we first used the sun to successfully phase - calibrate an observation of jupiter , and then jupiter to phase and amplitude calibrate an observation of saturn .",
    "the left plot of figure  [ fig - saturn - quasar ] shows a dirty image of saturn calibrated by an observation of jupiter made four hours later .",
    "the fwhm of this image is identical to that of the dirty beam shown in figure  [ fig - uv_coverage ] , and the index of asymmetry @xcite of the cleaned image is well below 5% .      after first light of the seven - element amiba in september 2006 , which was a drift scan on jupiter and",
    "whose image was quickly constructed , several months of start - up tests were used to study the instrumental properties , to fine tune our system , to study the ground pickup , and to find an optimal observing strategy . during this period , saturn ,",
    "mars , venus , and the crab nebula were also observed for system tests . in february 2007 ,",
    "when testing the two - patch observing strategy , we detected a first extragalactic object , quasar j0325 + 2224 with a total ( unresolved ) flux density of 550  mjy ( right plot of figure  [ fig - saturn - quasar ] ) .",
    "after further fine tuning of the system , in april  2007 we detected our first sze cluster , abell 2142 with a central sze decrement of around -320 mjy per beam .",
    "during 2007 we observed a total of six s - z clusters with @xmath1 : a1689 , a1995 , a2142 , a2163 , a2261 , and a2390 .",
    "the observations were always at night time , when the system is stable .",
    "due to the weather , system engineering , and observability of the targets , a total of roughly 150 observing hours was spent in observing the clusters or their trailing fields over a span of 5  months , from april to august in 2007 . during this period a lot of efforts",
