    "the dependence of the trajectories in fig.[fig1 ] on the pulse duration shows that the light  induced mn spin dynamics terminates soon after the end the photoexcitation , as expected in the absence of magnetic anisotropy .",
    "furthermore , the magnitude of the mn spin tilt increases with photoexcitation intensity .",
    "the spin dynamics of fig.[fig1 ] describes the fundamental response of the spin system to the optical excitation within the mean field approximation .",
    "the mn spin response is seen more clearly in fig.[fig2 ] , which shows the development with time of the y- and z  components of @xmath36 .",
    "both of these components vanish in the ground state .",
    "they develop on a timescale determined by the pulse duration and have comparable magnitudes for sufficiently large @xmath87 .",
    "the importance of the hole spin dephasing can be seen by comparing fig.[fig2 ] , obtained for very short spin and polarization dephasing times , with fig.[fig3 ] , obtained for @xmath138 .",
    "the most striking difference is the very small magnitude of the out - of  plane component @xmath139 when the hole spin is conserved ( @xmath138 ) .",
    "the hole spin follows the overall mn spin and remains more or less antiparallel to @xmath85 at all times , with the exception of a small component perpendicular to @xmath36 that triggers the spin dynamics .",

    "as discussed above , the magnetic anisotropy of the thermal carriers leads to preferred mn spin directions that minimize the total fermi sea energy @xmath39 , eq.([tot - en ] ) .",
    "its effects on the mn spin dynamics can be treated phenomenologically by adding the magnetic field @xmath140 to eq.([mn - spin ] ) .",
    "@xcite such an anisotropy field causes a nonlinear rotation and relaxation of the mn spin until it aligns with the easy axis direction that minimizes @xmath141 , so that @xmath142 .",

    "@xcite in this parameter regime , there are two degenerate ground states , which correspond to mn spin pointing at angles @xmath58 from the x  axis such that @xmath59 .",
    "the system can be prepared so that , prior to the photoexcitation , the mn spin points along either one of the above two easy axes . in the absence of magnetic anisotropy , both these initial conditions would result in the same mn spin trajectory .",
    "figs.[fig4](a ) and [ fig4](b ) compare the three mn spin components as function of time , starting with mn spin pointing along the two different ground state configurations . to make this comparison more meaningful ,",
    "in both cases we chose the x  axis of the coordinate system to coincide with the initial magnetization direction .",
    "fig.[fig4 ] clearly shows that , as the rabi energy increases , the two initial conditions lead to different time evolution , which implies that the two magnetic ground states can be distinguished . as can be seen by comparing fig.[fig4 ] with fig.[fig5 ] , the mn spin dynamics depends on the hole spin dephasing , especially as the photoexcitation intensity increases .    the dependence of the mn spin dynamics on the initial magnetic state becomes more clear in figs.[fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] , which plot the mn spin trajectories for the two initial conditions in the same coordinate system , whose x  axis coincides with the initial magnetizations .",
    "two different temporal regimes can be clearly distinguished .",
    "the first regime lasts for a time interval comparable to the pulse duration . here",
    "the dynamics is governed by the optical pulse intensity , duration , and helicity , as well as by the ratio @xmath145 and the mixing of the hole spin states that depend on the magnetic anisotropy . on the other hand , the magnetic anisotropy field eq.([h ] ) , due to the thermal carriers , plays a very minor role in this initial temporal regime for sufficiently large rabi energies that exceed the anisotropy constants .",
    "the trajectories for the different initial conditions coincide in this sub  picosecond regime , which gives an ultrafast magnetization tilt determined by the response to the hole spin photoexcited by the coherent spin raman processes described by eqs.([hole - spin ] ) and ( [ h ] ) . as can be seen by comparing figs.[fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] , the shape of the mn spin trajectories is strongly influenced by the spin and polarization dephasing .",
    "figs.[fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] show a rather abrupt change in the mn spin trajectory at times @xmath146 . at later times , the temporal evolution is determined by the magnetic anisotropy field eq.([h ] ) .",
    "the shape of the trajectory during many picoseconds depends critically on the magnetization tilt that develops during the femtosecond initial stage .",
    "if this tilt is sufficiently small , the mn spin dynamics is described by linearized equations of motion , expanded around the equilibrium spin values that minimize the fermi sea magnetic energy @xmath39 .",
    "this harmonic oscillation corresponds to zero  momentum magnon excitations , whose frequency is the same for the two easy axes .",
    "since the magnitude of the magnetization tilt can be controlled by the optical pulse intensity and duration , we conclude that for sufficiently short pulses and sufficiently small rabi energies , @xmath147 , the mn spin trajectories are very similar for both initial conditions .",
    "they correspond to magnetization precession around the easy axis ( magnons ) . however , with increasing photoexcitation intensity and duration , the deviation from the easy axis due to the sub ",
    "picosecond magnetization tilt increases , and eventually the mn spin dynamics can not be described by expanding @xmath39 around its minimum .",
    "such nonlinearities result in a complex trajectory , determined by the full nonlinear equations eqs.([mn - spin ] ) and ( [ h ] ) , which can differ substantially from a simple magnon precession . as demsonstrated by figs.[fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] , in this nonlinear dynamics regime , the mn spin trajectories depend on the initial condition .",
    "one can then distinguish between the different magnetic states , which can provide the basis for an ultrafast magnetic memory read  out scheme with speed limited only by the optical pulse duration .",
    "such a scheme would be based on controlling the ultrafast response of the spin system via the optical pulse intensity , duration , and helicity .",
    "furthermore , the strong dependence of the trajectory shape on the spin dephasing implies that the valence bandstructure and mixing of the hole spin states by the spin orbit interaction plays an important role . in the next section we interpret our numerical results by deriving from the full theory an effective landau  gilbert  like equation for the mn spin after expanding around the adiabatic limit .",
    "the numerical solution of the full mean field equations , discussed in the previous section , shows that the hole spin follows the mn spin more or less adiabatically .",
    "this is due to the much faster hole spin precession and relaxation as compared to the time ",
    "dependent changes in @xmath85 . to interpret the full numerical results ,",

    "describes a mn spin rotation around @xmath158 , whose magnitude is proportional to the gilbert damping coefficient @xmath156 , eq.([gilbert ] ) , and therefore vanishes if @xmath138 ( hole spin conserved ) .",
    "the last term describes a spin relaxation towards @xmath158 , determined by the exchange interaction .",
    "the above light  induced rotation and relaxation vanish after the decay of the optical pulse and e  h polarizations .",
    "eq.([eom - eff ] ) predicts an extremely fast response of the spin system , determined by the effective magnetic field pulse @xmath158 , whose speed is limited only by the pulse duration .",
    "this result points to a new way of controlling the magnetization during femtosecond time scales , much shorter than those accomplished so far .",
    "the last two terms on the rhs of eq.([eom - eff ] ) demonstrate an ultrafast modification of the effective magnetic field @xmath65 .",
    "eq.([eom - eff ] ) therefore predicts two regimes of time evolution , which can be separated due to their very different timescales .",
    "the initial temporal regime is controlled by the pulsed field @xmath158 and vanishes soon after the optical excitation .",
    "the second temporal regime is controlled by the anisotropy field @xmath159 , eq.([h ] ) , due to the thermal fermi sea , which depends nonlinearly on @xmath85 .",
    "we now turn to the effective light  induced magnetic field pulse @xmath158 . as can be seen from eq.([eom - eff ] ) , in order to trigger magnetization dynamics , @xmath158 must have a component perpendicular to the ground state mn spin and the easy axis .",

    "it is clear by comparing the two figures that the direction of @xmath158 , which governs the mn spin trajectory , depends on the dephasing .",
    "the mosty striking effect of @xmath87 is the development , on the time scale of the optical excitation , of a large component @xmath163 in the direction of optical pulse propagation .",
    "this component is strongly suppressed in the case of weak dephasing . as can be seen from eq.([eom - eff ] )",

    "induced mn spin rotation .",
    "the only effect of the photoexcitation is then the relaxation described by the last term of eq.([eom - eff ] ) , which causes the mn spin to relax towards the negative y  axis ( counter  clockwise rotation within the @xmath165 plane ) since @xmath166 in this case .",
    "the above trends are consistent with the full numerical calculation of the mean field equations discussed in the previous section . in appendix [ h - calc ]",
    "we derive an equation of motion for @xmath158 that demonstrates its dependence on the optical transition selection rules , the hole spin polarization , the magnetic exchange interaction , and the hole spin dephasing .",

    "<S> we develop a theory of collective spin dynamics triggered by ultrafast optical excitation of ferromagnetic semiconductors . using the density matrix equations of motion in the mean field approximation and including magnetic anisotropy and hole spin dephasing effects , we predict the development of a light  induced magnetization tilt during ultra  short time intervals comparable to the pulse duration . </S>",
    "<S> this femtosecond dynamics in the coherent temporal regime is governed by the interband nonlinear optical polarizations and is followed by a second temporal regime governed by the magnetic anisotropy of the fermi sea . </S>",
    "<S> we interpret our numerical results by deriving a landau  gilbert  like equation for the collective spin , which demonstrates an ultrafast correction to the magnetic anisotropy effective field due to second order coherent nonlinear optical processes . </S>",
    "<S> using the lindblad semigroup method , we also derive a contribution to the interband polarization dephasing determined by the mn spin and the hole spin dephasing . </S>",
    "<S> our predicted magnetization tilt and subsequent nonlinear dynamics due to the magnetic anisotropy can be controlled by varying the optical pulse intensity , duration , and helicity and can be observed with pump  probe magneto  optical spectroscopy . </S>"
