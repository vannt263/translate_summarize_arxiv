    "the purpose of this paper is to propose and analyze a model for valuation of a swing option , see , e.g. @xcite , written on multiple commodities when the commodity spot prices are driven by multiple , potentially non - gaussian factors .",
    "more precisely , the model is formulated as a dynamic programming problem in continuous time .",
    "the holder of the option is contracted an amount of a given commodity that can be purchased for a fixed price during the lifetime of the contract .",
    "the purchases can be done ( that is , the option can be exercised ) continuously in time such that contracted rate constraints are fulfilled .",
    "this form of contract originates from electricity markets , where they are called flexible load contracts , see , e.g. @xcite .",
    "however , this model setting can also fit a traditional swing option with a high number of swing rights and possible exercise times .",
    "for example , we can think of a situation in an electricity market where contract is written for a year and holder can exercise on the hour - ahead market .",
    "this results into over 8000 possible exercise times , which makes , in particular , monte - carlo methods virtually intractable .    during the recent years",
    ", there has been a lot of activity on analysis of swing options .",
    "being essentially a multi - strike american or bermudan option , a natural way to approach swing options is via an optimal multiple stopping problem . in the recent papers @xcite , the theory of optimal multiple stopping is developed in continuous time using sophisticated martingale theory . to compute option prices numerically ,",
    "they develop appropriate monte - carlo methodology .",
    "other methodology for swing option pricing includes forests of trees @xcite or stochastic meshes @xcite , multi - stage stochastic optimization @xcite , ( quasi-)variational inequalities @xcite and pde approaches @xcite .",
    "fundamentally , all of these methods are based on the dynamic programming principle .    as the main contribution of this paper ,",
    "we develop a valuation model for multi - commodity swing options inspired by @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the valuation problem was studied in the case of a single commodity driven by a one - factor gaussian price process . in this paper",
    ", we generalize the results of @xcite to cover multiple contracted commodities with prices driven by multiple factors . from applications point of view , this is an important generalization , since there is a substantial body of literature supporting the usage of multi - factor models for commodity prices .",
    "moreover , we allow also for non - gaussian factors , which are favored , for example , in electricity price models , see , e.g. @xcite .",
    "we model the factors as a multi - dimensional lvy diffusion and the underlying commodity prices are obtained by a linear mapping of the factors .",
    "this makes our model more tractable yet keeping it still very flexible as it allows us to take , for example , heat rates and spreads into account in a natural way .",
    "our study is also related to @xcite , where a similar model is used to study hedging of swing options .",
    "we also refer to @xcite , where swing option pricing is considered under a non - gaussian multi - factor price model .",
    "however , the analysis of @xcite is restricted to a modification of the so - called deng model ( see @xcite ) , which is a particular mean - reverting model . in our paper",
    ", we set up and analyze a class of models where the underlying factor prices follow a general lvy diffusion . the existing mathematical literature on swing options",
    "is mostly concerned with the pricing of a swing option .",
    "in addition to pricing , we also address the question of how to exercise a swing option optimally . from the analytical point of view",
    ", we identify using the hjb - equation an optimal exercise policy and characterize it in an intuitive way using the notion of marginal lost option value .",
    "we also present a numerical analysis of the problem including a numerical scheme based on the finite difference method .",
    "the reminder of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we propose our model for the valuation of swing options . in section 3",
    "we analyze some general properties of the value function .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the derivation of necessary and sufficient conditions for a function to coincide with the value function .",
    "we illustrate our results with explicit examples in section 5 , which are solved numerically in section 6 .",
    "finally , we conclude in section 7 .",
    "as we mentioned in the introduction , the prices of the commodities are driven by multiple factors . throughout the study ,",
    "the number of commodities is @xmath0 and the number of driving factors is @xmath1 .",
    "the factor dynamics @xmath2 are modeled by an @xmath1-dimensional lvy diffusion . to make a precise statement ,",
    "let @xmath3 be a complete filtered probability space satisfying the usual conditions , where @xmath4 is the filtration generated by @xmath2 .",
    "we assume that the factor process @xmath2 are given as a strongly unique solution of the it equation @xmath5 where @xmath6 is an @xmath7-dimensional , potentially correlated , brownian motion satisfying @xmath8 with @xmath9 $ ] for all @xmath10 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath11 denotes an @xmath12-dimensional poisson random measure with lvy measure @xmath13 given by the independent poisson processes @xmath14 . here , @xmath15 is the unit measure concentrated on zero and it is finite .",
    "the coefficients @xmath16\\times{\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{r}}}^n\\rightarrow{\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{r}}}^n$ ] , @xmath17\\times{\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{r}}}^n\\rightarrow{\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{r}}}^{n\\times n_b}$ ] and @xmath18\\times{\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{r}}}^n\\times{\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{r}}}^{n_l}\\longrightarrow{\\ensuremath{\\mathbb{r}}}^{n\\times n_l}$ ] are assumed to be sufficiently well behaving lipschitz continuous functions to guarantee that the it equation has a unique strong solution  see @xcite , p. 365",
    "the motivation to model the randomness using brownian and finite activity jump noise comes from electricity prices . in this framework ,",
    "the jump process models the spiky behavior in the prices whereas the brownian motion takes care of the small fluctuations .    using the factor dynamics @xmath2",
    ", we define the @xmath0-dimensional price process @xmath19 via the linear transformation @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 is a constant @xmath23 matrix with @xmath24 . in other words",
    ", there exists constants @xmath25 such that @xmath26 for all @xmath27 , that is , the commodity prices are linear combinations of the driving factors .",
    "the component @xmath28 models the time evolution of the price of the @xmath29th commodity and this price is driven by the @xmath1 factors , i.e. the @xmath1-dimensional lvy diffusion @xmath2 given as the solution of the it equation . since the price is linear as a function of the factors it is easy to change the model into a price model for spreads .",
    "furthermore , the matrix @xmath22 in can be interpreted as a constant weight between the different factors @xmath2 affecting the price . that allow us to take , for example , heat rates into account in our model .    in the definition of the factor dynamics",
    ", we assumed that the jump - diffusion @xmath2 and the driving brownian motion and lvy process have all different dimensions .",
    "for notational convenience , we assume in what follows that these dimensions are the same , i.e. @xmath30 . we point out that the following analysis holds with obvious modifications also in the case where these dimensions are different .",
    "the swing option written on the price process @xmath31 gives the right to purchase the given amount @xmath32 of the commodities @xmath29 over the time period @xmath33 $ ] .",
    "in addition to the global constraint @xmath32 , the purchases are also subject to a local constraint @xmath34 which corresponds to the maximal number of swing rights that can be exercised on a given time . since the swing option can be exercised in continuous time , the local constraint is the maximum rate at which the option can be exercised . to formalize this ,",
    "let @xmath35 be the set of @xmath36-measurable , real - valued processes @xmath37 satisfying the constraints @xmath38 , \\",

    "we point out that function @xmath61 is defined explicitly as a function of the factors @xmath2 .",
    "this corresponds to that the holder of the contract observes the underlying factor and bases her exercise decisions of this information .",
    "furthermore , we remark that this framework covers essentially call- and put - like payoffs , where the strike prices are given by the constant vector @xmath62 . now",

    "that is , we can exercise the option for each price component , which corresponds to different commodities , with a different decision variable .",
    "furthermore , we defined the function @xmath66 such that it takes values in @xmath42 .",

    "the limit @xmath72 imposes an effective constraint on the usage of the option in the sense that the amount @xmath72 is dominated by the amount that can be purchased if the option is exercised on full rate over the entire time horizon .",
    "this case , i.e. the case when an effective volume constraint is present , is the interesting one from the practical point of view .",
    "it is also substantially more difficult to analyze mathematically as we will see later . before considering this case , we study the complementary case when the effective volume constraint is absent .",
    "this will give us a point of reference in the other case .",
    "we consider first the case where @xmath73 for a given commodity @xmath29 .",

    "the trigger prices are in @xcite presented as exercise curves ( see more in figures below ) .",
    "these prices are presented similarly for the results of example 1 and example 2 .",

    "this is reasonable since the gaussian ou - process in example 1 has a symmetric distribution whereas the non - gaussian ou - process in example 2 has a positively skewed distribution .",
    "this positive skewness , which increases value in financial markets , is caused by the fact that we only have positive jumps .",

    "for example if we study the red curve and remove the point where @xmath294 , and make a linear least squares approximation of it , it will have a slope of @xmath357 .",
    "this means that the negative ratio of the mean reversion speeds approximates the slope of the exercise curves in the @xmath355-plane .",
    "this is plausible from an economical point of view for the following reason .",
    "if the mean reversion speed is smaller for @xmath290 than for @xmath291 , the holder will exploit a deviation from the long term mean earlier for process @xmath296 than @xmath295 by exercising the option .",
    "that is , she would require a higher contribution from @xmath290 to the price than from @xmath291 before exercising .",

    "the reason for this is the following : if the underlying price is small enough , you would expect it to be higher than this the rest of the time , and for @xmath353 it will therefore be beneficial to hold since @xmath358 .",
    "however , in figure [ fig:5 ] it can be seen that the exercise curves seems to stay above the line z=0.001 .",
    "this is due to numerical error / instability . for finer grids",
    "the exercise curves will be closer to @xmath359 at for small values of @xmath360 and @xmath353 .",
    "similar effects can be observed for other values of @xmath45 .",
    "the solution to this problem is either higher resolution on the grid , which requires more memory on the computer , or more accurate numerical schemes .",
    "the curves in figure [ fig:6 ] bends a little in the lower right corner , and this is due to the mentioned instability in the numerical scheme .",
    "[ fig:56 ]      the analysis of the numerical scheme in example 1 and example 2 is similar to that of @xcite .",
    "to analyse example 3 we study the courant - friedrichs - lewy ( cfl ) condition .",
    "the cfl number of the hjb equation in example 3 is @xmath361 a necessary condition for convergence is that the cfl number @xmath362 , and in our case with @xmath363 we see that the cfl number @xmath364 .",
    "as mentioned we have observed some small instabilities in the numerical solution .",
    "we have also tried with larger values of @xmath365 compared to @xmath366 , but the reported discretization parameters seem to give most accurate solutions . in order to establish convergence",
    "an implicit scheme should be developed , but this is not done in this work .    in the following",
    "we will present some evidence that the numerical solution converges to the correct solution of the hjb equation .",
    "we attempt to evaluate both the numerical scheme and the calculated boundary conditions using .",
    "this is done by trying to see how well they fit for extreme values of @xmath290 , i.e. @xmath367 .",
    "we have used a very fine grid to solve hjb equation where @xmath105 is required to be linear in @xmath290-direction at the boundaries .",
    "this is similar to @xcite , where it is shown that this type of inaccurate boundary condition gives quite accurate solutions .",
    "now this solution can be compared to the values we get from equation .",
    "the difference between the numerical solution of the hjb equation and the value calculated by is illustrated in figure [ fig:7 ] .",
    "we see that the difference is relatively small compared to the option value . for this example with @xmath353 and @xmath368",
    "it is about 6 orders of magnitude lower than the option value .",
    "this is sufficiently small for us to trust the numerical solver .",
    "the difference may come from all of the following five sources : assumptions that the control is as described in , numerical inaccuracy / instability of the scheme , truncation in @xmath290 direction , truncation in @xmath291 direction , extrapolation in @xmath291 direction and linear boundary condition on the pde solver .",
    "in this paper , we developed and analyzed a valuation model for swing options on multi - commodity markets .",
    "the model is formulated as a dynamic programming problem , where the underlying dynamic structure is given by a multi - dimensional lvy diffusion .",
    "this process models the price evolution of the commodities .",
    "the commodity prices are driven by a multi - dimensional brownian motion and a multi - dimensional compound poisson process .",
    "the introduction of the compound poisson process is important since it allows non - gaussian price evolution .",
    "this is important , in particular , on electricity markets , see , e.g. @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this model allows us to take into account jumps in price processes , which is also important on electricity markets .    from a analytical point of view",
    ", this study provides a multi - dimensional generalization of the analysis in @xcite .",
    "first , we analyze the model in the absence of an effective volume constraint . along the lines of @xcite",
    ", we find that in this case the option does not loose value if used .",
    "moreover , we prove that in the presence of an effective volume constraint for a given commodity , the usage of the option for this commodity will lower the value of the option .",
    "this is a intuitively appealing from the economical point of view . to tackle the problem of finding an optimal exercise rule and the price of the option",
    ", we analyze the pricing problem using the bellman principle of optimality and derive the associated hjb - equation . in section 4 , we obtained an optimal exercise rule which states that if the immediate exercise payoff dominated the lost option value for a given commodity , then the option on this commodity should be exercised at a full rate .",
    "in particular , we conclude that this optimal exercise rule is a bang - bang rule .",
    "we also provide a verification theorem , which states conditions under which a given function coincides with the value function .",
    "in addition we illustrate the results with three examples which we study numerically .",
    "we set up a straightforward fdm scheme to solve the associated hjb - equations .",
    "the numerical experiments seems to give reasonable results from both mathematical and economical points of view . in the last of our examples",
    "we have also given evidence for convergence of the numerical solution .",
