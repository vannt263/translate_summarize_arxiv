    "we are interested in numerical solutions of the fully nonlinear elliptic monge - ampre equation @xmath1 on a convex bounded domain @xmath2 of @xmath3 with boundary @xmath4 .",
    "the unknown @xmath5 is a real valued function and @xmath6 are given functions with @xmath7 in the non degenerate case and @xmath8 in the degenerate case .",
    "we will also assume that @xmath9 and @xmath10 in @xmath11 .",
    "starting with @xcite , interest has grown for finite element methods which are able to capture non smooth solutions of second order fully nonlinear equations . for smooth solutions ,",
    "the problem was studied in the context of @xmath0 conforming approximations by b@xmath12hmer @xcite and in the context of lagrange elements by brenner and al @xcite .",
    "non smooth solutions can be handled in the context of the vanishing moment methodology @xcite which is a singular perturbation of .    in this paper",
    "we give numerical evidence that @xmath0 conforming approximations of a natural variational formulation of converge for non smooth solutions of the two dimensional problem .",
    "this is achieved by discretizing new iterative methods we introduce .",
    "we establish the convergence of the iterative methods under the assumption that the discrete problem has a convex solution .",
    "we prove that such a solution exists when has a smooth convex solution .",
    "we do not assume that has a smooth solution for our iterative methods to converge .",
    "the existence of a convex solution to the discrete problem in the general case and the convergence of the discretization will be addressed in a subsequent paper .",
    "even with such an existence result , it is still a non trivial task to solve the discrete nonlinear systems in situations where has a non smooth solution .",
    "this paper addresses this issue .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a review of numerical methods for fully nonlinear equations of monge - ampre type .",
    "the main technical innovation of this paper is the proof that in the context of @xmath0 conforming approximations , discrete functions near a strictly convex solution are strictly convex .",
    "this explains why convexity did not need to be imposed explicitly in some previous studies .",
    "newton s method remains the most appropriate iterative method for solving the discrete nonlinear equations when has a smooth convex solution .",
    "we give a new proof of convergence of newton s method in the context of @xmath0 conforming approximations .",
    "the results of this paper extend easily to finite dimensional spaces of piecewise smooth @xmath0 functions provided that the approximation property and inverse estimates below hold .",
    "our results can be described in the general context of discretizations by @xmath0 elements of iterative methods for a general nonlinear elliptic equation @xmath13 . in the case of the monge - ampre equation , @xmath14 .",
    "we first describe the iterative methods at the continuous level .",
    "however , we will not address convergence at the continuous level . as an initial guess we take the solution of the poisson equation @xmath15 in @xmath16 on @xmath4 .",
    "we assume that @xmath17 differentiable and consider the sequence of problems @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a linear operator which can be taken as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the identity operator or @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the laplace operator and @xmath24 is a parameter .",
    "pseudo transient continuation methods @xcite form a general class of methods for solving nonlinear singular equations . in the case of the monge - ampre equation ,",
    "the method consists in solving the sequence of approximate problems @xmath25 here @xmath26 denotes the matrix of cofactors of the matrix @xmath27 .",
    "given @xmath24 , we consider the sequence of iterates @xmath28 this can be interpreted as an euler discretization of the pseudo time dependent equation @xmath29 or as a laplacian preconditioner of a simple pseudo time marching algorithm , @xcite @xmath30 see also a remark in @xcite .    to the author s best knowledge ,",
    "this is the first time the pseudo transient continuation method and the time marching method are used to indicate numerically convergence to viscosity solutions of finite element type methods for the monge - ampre equation .",
    "the methods we propose can be used in the context of different types of discretizations allowing us in particular to treat more easily non - rectangular domains .",
    "the methods can be accelerated with fast poisson solvers and multigrid methods .",
    "this latter property is even more striking for the time marching method as its implementation requires only having access to a multigrid poisson solver .",
    "although the theory of the monge - ampre equation has concentrated on convex solutions , one can equally focus on concave solutions .",
    "we found out that is better able to capture concave solutions .",
    "it is easy to implement , requiring only a poisson solver .",
    "for example one can capture weak solutions of the monge - ampere equation by simply discretizing with the standard lagrange finite elements .",
    "the time marching method can also be applied to fully nonlinear equations such as the pucci equation where @xmath17 is not differentiable . in summary",
    "the pseudo transient continuation methods are better for smooth solutions and singular solutions on a coarse mesh .",
    "otherwise the method of choice is the time marching method .",
    "we organize the paper as follows : in the second section we introduce some notation and prove the key result that discrete functions near a strictly convex solution are strictly convex .",
    "we introduce the natural variational formulation of and state an existence and uniqueness result for the discrete problem .",
    "the result can be inferred from the ones in @xcite .",
    "we give new proofs in section [ existence ] . as a corollary the discrete variational problem has a convex solution when has a smooth convex solution .",

    "a special case is newton s method for which we prove a quadratic convergence rate .",
    "the time marching methods are studied in section [ time ] .",
    "the last section is devoted to numerical results .",
    "we give a brief description of the spline element method which is used for the computations and offer heuristics about why our methods appear to preserve convexity .",
