    "in this note we apply a practical deterministic attack on the protocol proposed in @xcite .",
    "this kind of attack introduced by the first author in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and developed in @xcite works when the platform objects are linear .",
    "it turns out that in this case , contrary to the common opinion ( and some explicitly stated security assumptions ) , one does not need to solve the underlying algorithmic problems to break the scheme , i.e. , there is another algorithm that recovers the private keys without solving the principal algorithmic problem on which the security assumptions are based .",
    "the efficacy of the attack depends on the platform group , so it requires a specific analysis in each particular case . in general",
    "one can only state that the attack is in polynomial time in the size of the data , when the platform and related groups are given together with their linear representations .",
    "in many other cases we can effectively use known linear presentations of the groups under consideration .",
    "a theoretical base for the decomposition method is described in @xcite where a series of examples is presented .",
    "the monography @xcite solves uniformly many protocols based on the conjugacy search problem , protocols based on the decomposition and factorization problems , protocols based on actions by automorphisms , and a number of other protocols .",
    "see also @xcite and @xcite where the linear decomposition attack is applied to the main protocols in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .    in a series of works @xcite , @xcite and @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) tsaban presented another general approach for provable polynomial time solutions of computational problems in groups with efficient , faithful representation as matrix groups .    all along the paper",
    "we denote by @xmath0 the set of all nonnegative integers , and by @xmath1 the set of all complex numbers .",
    "in this section , we describe the andrecut s key exchange protocol proposed in @xcite .",
    "firstly we introduce a necessary terminology . then we will give a cryptanalysis of this protocol .",
    "let @xmath2 be a complex matrix of size @xmath3 , that is considered as a variable .",
    "let @xmath4    be two complex polynomials in @xmath5 uniquely defined by the complex vectors of coefficients @xmath6 and @xmath7    * alice chooses the secret vectors @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( alice s private key ) . *",
    "alice randomly generates and publishes the matrix @xmath10 ( alice s matrix public key ) .",
    "* bob chooses the secret vectors @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( bob s private key ) . *",
    "bob randomly generates and publishes the matrix @xmath13 ( bob s matrix public key ) .",
    "* alice computes and publishes the matrix @xmath14 ( alice s public key ) .",
    "* bob computes and publishes the matrix @xmath15 ( bob s public key ) . * alice calculates the secret matrix @xmath16 * bob calculates the secret matrix @xmath17 . *",
    "the established secret key is @xmath18    it is assumed in @xcite , that the matrices @xmath19 and @xmath20 are different to give the non - commutativity assumption @xmath21 and @xmath22 . in general ,",
    "even more strong assumption @xmath23 is not enough for this non - commutativity .    also , there is a remark in @xcite that the following assumption @xmath24 should be satisfied in order to increase the security .",
    "but by the classical cayley - hamilton theorem every matrix @xmath19 is a root of its own characteristic polynomial @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the identity matrix of size @xmath3 .",
    "the degree of @xmath27 is exactly @xmath28 .",
    "then for any matrix @xmath10 and every matrix polynomial @xmath29 one has @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the remainder after division of the polynomial @xmath29 by @xmath32 hence , there is no sense to use in the protocol above polynomials of degrees @xmath33",
    "we will provide two approaches to cryptanalysis of the protocol described in the previous section .",
    "the first one is based on some simple facts from linear algebra and the second one is based on a linear decomposition attack .    as we have seen in the previous section , there is no sense to use values @xmath34 .",
    "thus we can assume that @xmath35 .",
    "consider the linear systems @xmath36 of @xmath37 equations with @xmath38 unknowns @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "having a solution of the systems ( [ eq : systems ] ) one can compute the secret key as follows @xmath41 solution of a system of @xmath28 equations with @xmath28 unknowns using gauss elimination requires @xmath42 time .",
    "thus solution of the systems ( [ eq : systems ] ) requires @xmath43 time . having precomputed values @xmath44 and @xmath45 ,",
    "for @xmath46 , one can perform the step ( [ eq : key_computation ] ) in @xmath47 time .",
    "so the overall time complexity for this approach is @xmath47 .",
    "further we will describe the second approach based on a linear decomposition attack .",
    "the algebra @xmath48 has a structure of a vector space over @xmath1 of dimension @xmath49 let @xmath50 be the semigroup generated by @xmath51 and let @xmath52 be the semigroup generated by @xmath53 a basis of the subspace sp@xmath54 can be effectively constructed as follows .",
    "let @xmath55 be the sets of matrices considered as vectors .",
    "define @xmath56 for @xmath57 the vector space spanned by the indicated set .",
    "we choose a basis @xmath58 of @xmath59 , then extend @xmath60 to basis @xmath61 of @xmath62 , and so on . if for some @xmath63 we get @xmath64 then clearly @xmath65 is a basis of sp@xmath54 . by the cayley - hamilton theorem",
    "one has @xmath66 in construction of @xmath67 we only use the gauss elimination process that is polynomial .",
    "note , that we can do it offline , so we will call this phase the _ offline phase_. let @xmath68 be a basis of sp@xmath54 , where @xmath69 .",
    "now we are ready to recover the secret key @xmath70 ( _ online phase _ ) .",
    "now we will provide a rough estimate for the time complexity of the approach above .",
    "observe that the number of the field operations in gauss elimination performed on a matrix of size @xmath74 is @xmath75 .",
    "a basis of sp@xmath54 consist of at most @xmath37 elements , so it requires @xmath76 time to construct it .",
    "computing @xmath77 in ( [ eq : b ] ) by solving a system of linear equations using gauss elimination requires @xmath43 time . having precomputed values @xmath78 and @xmath79 ,",
    "for @xmath80 , one can perform the step ( [ eq : key_computation_2 ] ) in @xmath81 time .",
    "so the offline phase could be done in @xmath82 time , the online phase could be done in @xmath43 time , and the overall time complexity is @xmath82 .",
