    "general relativity proposed by einstein in 1915 can explain successfully the macroscopic properties of gravity .",
    "nevertheless the effort trying to quantize general relativity failed because of the perturbative nonrenormalizability . which is to say we ca nt control the divergence of perturbatively quantized general relativity .",
    "as the result , general relativity is thought of as the only effective theory of a fundamental theory defined on higher energy scale .",
    "for example , super string theory and supergravity were proposed as such a theory .",
    "but it is shown that these theories are also perturbatively nonrenormalizable @xcite .",
    "on the other hand there is the prospect that quantized general relativity will become consistent nonperturbatively . by this",
    "means the @xmath0 - expanded analysis in 2 + @xmath0 gravity @xcite and the implication of the erge @xcite @xcite showed that quantized general relativity is nonperturbatively renormalizable according to the asymptotic safety that was put forward by weinberg @xcite .",
    "this idea is that the quantum theory which lies on the ultraviolet critical surface of some ultraviolet fixed point is renormalizable .",
    "thus several theories of qg exist , but an universally accepted one is absent .",
    "the reason of persisting in this situation is mainly because the constraints from experiments do nt exist .",
    "currently , the measurements by cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) spectral , type ia supernovae observation and so on are consistent with an infinite flat universe containing about 30% cold dark matter , 65% dark energy and 5% ordinary matter .",
    "furthermore many observations are going to clarify the current and past universe . in the circumstances the early universe",
    "can be considered a good laboratory for qg .",
    "one of the reasons is to think that the universe experienced the period such as immediately after the big bang in which qg effects dominated . and",
    "the trace of qg effects may be observed by the current precision measurements .",
    "therefore to construct the universe model out of consideration of a certain type of qg can be thought of as the test of the theory .",
    "if the model can explain some of the problems of modern cosmology such as the horizon and flatness problems , the cosmological constant problem , the one of the construction of the large scale structure , the identity of the dark matter and energy and so on , it is thought of as the suggestive matter to believe that the theory is correct .    here",
    "the very early universe is considered in according to the result by the analysis of the erge of quantized general relativity .",
    "this idea is also an approximate one to justify the present situation that the classical general relativity is used to the study of the early universe and inflation mechanism and so on , because the analysis of the erge assure that general relativity is the fundamental theory .    in the next section the erge formalism for qg by reuter",
    "is reviewed in brief . in section 3 the properties of qg in light of the erge analysis are described . in section 4 the applications of qg to the very early universe and the behavior of the qg improved universe",
    "are discussed .",
