    "the potential constituent quark model has been quite successful in describing the low - lying hadron spectrum @xcite .",
    "being an effective classification scheme , it does not care about foundations in terms of underlying qcd dynamics . despite its successes the non - relativistic description clearly has limitations .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the angular momentum content of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons . in the spectroscopic notation",
    "@xmath6 the @xmath0 is assigned to the @xmath7 state by the quark model .",
    "the @xmath1 is assigned to the @xmath8 state , hence being the first radial excitation of the @xmath0 .",
    "however , this assumption is by far not clear from the underlying qcd dynamics , and is an output of the non - relativistic potential description of a meson as a two - body system .    in principle",
    "the angular momentum content of the leading quark - antiquark fock components of mesons can be identified by a lattice simulation  @xcite .",
    "the crucial ingredients to such a study are the overlap factors obtained with operators that form a complete set with respect to the chiral - parity group . from these overlap factors",
    "the chiral content of a state can be identified .",
    "then , given a unitary transformation between the chiral basis and the @xmath9 basis we can reconstruct the angular momentum content . since the chiral content is important for such a study we need a lattice fermion discretization , which respects chiral symmetry .",
    "this is why we use overlap fermions , which distinguishes the present study from the previous ones .",
    "we find in contrast to the previous studies that the @xmath1 is practically a pure @xmath10 state .",
    "we will argue that our result is correct due to a careful analysis of the signs of the overlap factors .",
    "further , we remove the low - lying dirac eigenmodes of the spectrum , which has been done recently to show an emergent @xmath11 symmerty in the qcd spectrum .",
    "this symmetry connects all flavors and quark chiralities , which means in the two - flavor case that @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 are connected with each other .",
    "here we study the effect of the dirac eigenmode removal on the overlap factors of _ vector _ and _ pseudotensor _ interpolators .    the outline of the article is as follows : in section [ cformalism ] we present the method how to extract the chiral and angular momentum content of the physical states . in section [ cresolution - scale ]",
    "we discuss our simulation parameters and introduce a resolution scale for our measurements . in section [ cresults ] we present our main findings . in section [ cunbreaking ]",
    "we discuss the effect of removing the low - lying eigenmodes on the @xmath16 states . finally , in section [ cconclusions ] we give a short conclusion .",
    "the formalism how to extract chiral and angular momentum content from lattice correlators has been explained in detail in ref .",
    "we review the basic steps .    to generate states with @xmath16 quantum numbers @xmath17",
    "two different local interpolators can be used , which belong to two distinct chiral representations @xmath18 we denote them according to their dirac structure as _ vector ( v ) _ and _ pseudotensor ( t ) _ interpolators .",
    "both of them couple to the physical @xmath16 states .",
    "the interpolators ( [ veccurrent ] ) , ( [ pseudocurrent ] ) transform differently under @xmath19 and therefore belong to two different chiral representations . if chiral symmetry would be manifest in nature , these two interpolators would generate two different particles and the index of the irreducible representation of the chiral - parity group would be an additional quantum number . in the real world , where chiral symmetry is broken ,",
    "a physical @xmath16-meson is a mixture of two possible chiral representations and consequently both interpolators create the same physical @xmath16-meson .    in a next step",
    "we connect the chiral basis to the angular momentum basis with quantum numbers isospin @xmath20 and @xmath9 . for spin-@xmath21 isovector mesons",
    "there are only two allowed states @xmath22 and @xmath23 , which are connected to the chiral basis by a unitary transformation @xcite : @xmath24 this transformation is valid only in the rest frame .    on the lattice",
    "we evaluate the correlators @xmath25 .",
    "we apply the variational technique , where different interpolators are used to construct the correlation matrix @xmath26 . by solving the generalized eigenvalue problem @xmath27 the masses of the states",
    "can be extracted from the eigenvalues : @xmath28 a single entry of the correlation matrix reads @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the overlap of interpolator @xmath31 with the physical state @xmath32 .",
    "the ratio of these overlap factors gives a relative weight of the different chiral representations in a given physical state .",
    "it can be constructed as @xmath33 we note that the ratio of eigenvector components @xmath34 is not suited due to the lack of a unique normalization for different operators",
    ".    we can extract the ratio @xmath35 for each state @xmath36 .",
    "then via the unitary transformation ( [ rhovec]),([rhotensor ] ) we arrive at the angular momentum content of the @xmath16 mesons .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : trafo ] we show the dependence of the partial wave content of a state on the ratio ( [ ratio ] ) .",
    "for example , if the @xmath16 state is a pure @xmath7 state , then two different chiral components have to mix in the following way : @xmath37 in our lattice evaluation for the ground state @xmath16 we will not find the value @xmath38 but a value which is close to it .",
    "denotes the ratio of interpolator overlap factors with the physical @xmath16 states . ]",
    "we use gauge configurations generously provided by the jlqcd collaboration , see ref .",
    "the ensemble consists of 100 configurations of two - flavor dynamical overlap fermions .",
    "the topological sector is fixed to @xmath39 .",
    "lattice size and spacing are @xmath40 at @xmath41 fm .",
    "the pion mass is at @xmath42 mev @xcite .",
    "we calculate the isovector correlators with extended sources with different smearing widths of gaussian type , described below .",
    "the _ vector _ current @xmath43 is conserved , i.e. its coupling @xmath44 to the physical state should be independent of the scale .",
    "the _ pseudotensor _",
    "current @xmath45 is not conserved .",
    "hence , @xmath46 should depend on the scale where it is measured .",
    "consequently the ratio @xmath35 should also depend on the scale .",
    "an intrinsic resolution scale is set by the lattice spacing @xmath47 .",
    "if we probe the hadron structure with the point - like source then the result should display a structure of a hadron that is obtained at the scale fixed by the ultraviolet regularization @xmath47 . in principle",
    "we could study the @xmath47-dependence by means of different lattices with different @xmath47 .",
    "however , such a procedure does not allow to measure the structure close to the infrared region , i.e. at large @xmath47 .    instead of variing @xmath47",
    ", we can smear the sources of the quark propagators using different widths @xmath48 .",
    "clearly , the smeared source can not supply us with the information about the hadron structure that is sensitive to distances that are smaller than the smearing width @xmath48 .",
    "consequently the smearing width @xmath48 defines a scale at which we probe the structure of our hadron .",
    "this is done using the gaussian gauge invariant smearing of the source and sink operators . for a definition of the gaussian ( jacobi ) smearing",
    "we refer to ref . @xcite and references therein .",
    "we use four different smearing widths in this study .",
    "the corresponding profiles are given in table [ tab : sources ] .",
    "the radius @xmath48 of a given source @xmath49 located at @xmath50 is calculated by @xmath51 we define the resolution scale as @xmath52 .",
    ".different jacobi - smeared sources , generating parameters @xmath53 and @xmath54 @xcite , widths @xmath48 and resolution scales @xmath55 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : sources ]    the profiles are pictured in figure [ fig : sources ] .",
    "the _ super narrow _ source probes the hadron wave function at the resolution @xmath56 fm and marks the ultraviolet end of our parameter space .",
    "_ narrow _ and _ wide _ probe the hadron in the mid - momentum region .",
    "the _ ultra wide _ source does not resolve details smaller than @xmath57 fm and marks our infrared end . in this study",
    "it is not reasonable to go any further in the infrared due to the box size of @xmath58 fm .",
    "note that the gauge configurations remain untouched throughout the whole process .",
    "as a consistency check we first extract the masses of the @xmath16 states with our four source profiles and end up with the same results as already found in ref .",
    "masses of mesons , as expected , do not depend on the resolution scale @xmath55 and on a choice of a number of smearings used in the eigenvalue problem ( 5 ) .     ratio for different resolutions . ]    to study the ratio @xmath35 at different resolution scales @xmath55 we solve the @xmath59 eigenvalue problem ( 5)-(7 ) with operators ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) and four different smearings . then using ( 8) we exctract the ratio @xmath35 as a function of @xmath55 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : finalplot ] we show the ratio @xmath35 at different resolution scales @xmath55 .",
    "we find a clear @xmath55-effect on the ratio @xmath35 . for both @xmath16 and @xmath60 states",
    "we see a linear dependence on the resolution scale between @xmath61 fm and @xmath62 fm .    in the infrared , at the resolution scale @xmath62 fm ,",
    "the ratios are given by @xmath63 for the ground state @xmath16 meson and @xmath64 for the first excited state .",

    "the ratio @xmath65 for the ground state @xmath16 meson then means that the chiral representation @xmath66 is slightly favoured .",
    "for the first excited state with @xmath67 the @xmath3 representation is slightly favoured .",
    "using now transformations ( [ rhovec]),([rhotensor ] ) we find : @xmath68 \\ket{\\rho(1450 ) } = & - \\left(0.106 \\pm 0.09\\;\\ ; \\right ) \\ket{^3s_1 } \\\\&-",
    "\\left(0.994 \\pm 0.005 \\right ) \\ket{^3d_1}\\;. \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the ground state @xmath16 is therefore practically a pure @xmath4 state , in agreement with the potential quark model assumption .",
    "the first excited @xmath16 is , however , a @xmath5 state with a very small admixture of a @xmath4 wave .",
    "the latter result is in clear contradiction with the potential constituent quark model that attributes the first excited state of the @xmath16-meson as a radially excited @xmath4 state .",
    "we now study the effect of removing the low - lying modes of the dirac operator on the ratio @xmath35 .",
    "its effect on the hadron spectrum has been studied extensively in refs .",
    "the banks - casher relation connects the low - lying modes of the dirac operator to the quark condensate .",
    "hence by removing the lowest eigenmodes we decouple our @xmath16 states from the chiral symmetry breaking dynamics .",
    "the procedure of removing the low modes from the quark propagator ( @xmath69 denotes the quark propagator ) is given as : @xmath70     fm and @xmath71 fm . here",
    "@xmath72 corresponds to the full theory . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : restoration ] we show the value @xmath35 for the ground state @xmath16 and excited @xmath73 at different resolutions @xmath55 for an increasing number of removed modes . for @xmath72 ,",
    "i.e. the full theory , the mesons are a strong mixture of both chiral representations . with",
    "an increasing number of modes removed the ground state @xmath16 meson approaches a pure @xmath66 state , whereas the first excited state @xmath73 becomes a pure @xmath3 state .",
    "already at @xmath74 the states are strongly dominated by one chiral representation : the chiral representations , which are slightly favored for @xmath72 , become dominant for @xmath75 .",
    "after removal of @xmath76 lowest modes both @xmath16 and @xmath60 get degenerate , which reflects a @xmath77 symmetry @xcite of qcd in euclidean space - time @xcite .",
    "for other recent studies of this issue see refs .",
    "in this paper we addressed the issue of the angular momentum content of the leading quark - antiquark component of @xmath16 and @xmath1 . in the potential constituent quark model both states",
    "are assumed to be @xmath4 state .",
    "we investigated this issue via a lattice simulation with dynamical overlap fermions .",
    "we studied the ratio of overlap factors of _ vector _ and _ pseudotensor _ interpolators that belong to different chiral representations .",
    "we observed this ratio of overlap factors to be negative for the @xmath1 , which implies that this state is a @xmath5 state with only a tiny @xmath4 component .",
    "the @xmath0 is , in agreement with the quark model , a @xmath4 state .",
    "then we studied the effect of removing the low - lying dirac eigenmodes on the ratio of overlap factors .",
    "the state , which was identified as the ground state @xmath16 at truncation zero , becomes the @xmath2 state , while the @xmath60 meson becomes a pure @xmath3 state .",
