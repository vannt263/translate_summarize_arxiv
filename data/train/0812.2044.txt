    "the threshold for charge renormalization closely coincides with the onset of a spinodal phase instability predicted by linearized effective - interaction theories  @xcite for deionized ( but not salt - free ) suspensions of highly charged colloids .",
    "although observations consistent with bulk phase separation have been reported  @xcite , the experimental picture of deionized suspensions remains cloudy .",
    "furthermore , the relevant parameter regime is not yet accessible to primitive model simulations .",
    "recent studies based on the pb cell model have concluded that the predicted instability may be an artifact of linearization approximations  @xcite .",
    "preliminary calculations based on the present approach indicate , however , that the phase instability may survive charge renormalization  @xcite .",
    "future work will continue to explore the remarkable phase behavior of deionized suspensions .",
