    "the discovery of pseudogap phenomenon in the normal state of underdoped cuprate oxides renews the interest of exploiting the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of electron pairs .",
    "one of theories attributes this unusual phenomenon to the bec of the pre - formed singlet pairs under such an assumption that a smooth crossover from the bec to the bcs regimes can emerge with increasing carrier concentration@xcite .",
    "there are also other theories related to the pre - formed electron pairs ( see , e.g. ref.@xcite for a review ) or bipolarons@xcite in cuprates . on the other hand ,",
    "the evolution from the bcs theory to the bec regime has been discussed long time ago by eagles@xcite , leggett@xcite , nozires and schmitt - rink @xcite , and others ( see , e.g. ref.@xcite for a review ) .",
    "a key ingredient is to modify the electron - phonon interacting potential by plugging a two - particle scattering length in the bcs reduced hamitonian so that a crossover parameter @xmath0 proportional to the inverse of the scattering length , is introduced , which results in the crossover from the bcs condensation ( @xmath1 ) of the cooper pairs to the bec ( @xmath2 ) of tightly bound electron pairs .",
    "the chemical potential is zero at the transition point .",
    "note that the cooper pairs are formed in the weak coupling limit in momentum space , while tightly bound electron pairs are formed in the strongly attractive coupling limit in real space .",
    "with regard to the aforementioned theories , people intuitively believe that in the strong coupling limit the tightly bound electron pairs can be taken as bosons , each of which may be constituted by two fermions ( e.g. electrons ) through certain mechanism , and they can undergo the bec below a certain temperature .",
    "however , whether or not the tightly bound electron pairs can really undergo the bec _ directly _ , is an old but fundamental ( and nontrivial ) problem , particularly as we know that the bound electron pairs are not exactly bosons@xcite .",
    "if not , what are the corresponding bosons in these theories ? on the other hand , in the boson - fermion model for superconductivity@xcite a localized boson ( or a bipolaron ) which was also regarded as a kind of tightly bound electron pair , was simply replaced by a hard - core boson . what is the underlying physics behind such a simple replacement ? in this paper , we shall try to address these questions .",
    "our result appears to show that the fluctuations of the tightly bound electron pairs play a central role . in the following",
    ", we shall first show why the tightly bound electron pairs could not undergo the bec _ directly _ in momentum space using the standard argument , and then introduce two kinds of schwinger bosons ( _ binon _ and _ vacanon _ ) and argue that a binon is a kind of fluctuations of the tightly bound electron pairs and a vacanon corresponds to a vacant state .",
    "these two bosonic quasiparticles may be responsible for the bec of the system .",
    "these concepts are also applied to the attractive hubbard model in the strong coupling limit , and it appears that this special system can be exploited on the basis of binons and vacanons . finally , we shall discuss briefly the relevance of our argument to the existing theories concerning the bec of electron pairs .",
    "the operators of a tightly bound electron pair are defined in real space as usual in the following@xcite : @xmath3 where @xmath4@xmath5 is the annihilation operator of an electron with up(down)-spin at site @xmath6 obeying the anticommutation relations .",
    "it is well - known that they satisfy the standard su(2 ) algebra : @xmath7 = 2 b^{0}_{i}\\delta_{ij},$ ] @xmath8 = \\pm b_{i}^{\\pm}\\delta_{ij},$ ] with @xmath9 and @xmath10 the number operator of electrons at site @xmath6 , as well as the bosonic property @xmath11 = [ b_{i}^{\\dag } , b_{j}^{\\dag } ] = 0 $ ] .",
    "owing to pauli s exclusion principle , the tightly bound electron pairs exhibit the hard - core property , satisfying @xmath12 moreover , it can be observed that there exists an important property ( i.e. , an anticommutator ) : @xmath13 implying that a tightly bound electron pair has fermionic characters . as the bec takes place only in momentum space",
    ", we need to consider their fourier transforms .",
    "the hermitian property ( @xmath14 ) and the consistency require that the fourier transforms of the operators for the tightly bound electron pairs can only be defined through the following forms : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the number of lattice sites , and kronecker s delta function is defined by @xmath17 .",
    "it should be noted that the operator @xmath18 differs from the cooper pair operator @xmath19 ( see below ) .",
    "the commutation relations of the fourier transforms are of the form : @xmath20 =   2 { \\tilde b}_{{\\bf k}-{\\bf k}'}^{0},$ ] @xmath21 =   - { \\tilde b}_{{\\bf k}+{\\bf k}'},$ ] @xmath22 =    { \\tilde b}_{{\\bf k}-{\\bf k}'}^{\\dag } , $ ] @xmath23 = [ { \\tilde b}_{\\bf k}^{\\dag } , { \\tilde b}_{\\bf k'}^{\\dag } ] = 0.$ ] considering the fourier transform of the electron operator , @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) , one may find the relationship between operators @xmath26 and electron operators : @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",
    "clearly , the tightly bound electron pair in momentum space consists of the superposition of two electrons with different momenta and is spin - singlet . unlike the standard cooper pair , the total momenta of",
    "the two pairing electrons here is nonzero .",
    "it is interesting to mention that the hard - core property like eq .",
    "( [ hc - i ] ) no longer holds in momentum space , namely , @xmath30 , and the anticommutator like eq .",
    "( [ commu - fm ] ) will not remain true in momentum space , suggesting that the fermionic properties which exist in real space do not appear in momentum space .",
    "therefore , in contrast to the cooper pair @xmath19 which possesses exactly the same commutation relations as the tightly bound electron pair in real space , the latter may purely show bosonic behavior in momentum space , which appears in turn to suggest that the bec of the tightly bound electron pairs in momentum space be possible .",
    "now , let us examine if the bec of the noninteracting tightly bound electron pairs in momentum space can really occur . by noting the fact @xmath31",
    ", we define the number operator per volume , @xmath32 , of the tightly bound electron pairs in momentum space as @xmath33 .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath32 can be argued to be non - negative integers in the infinite volume of the system .",
    "this may be reached by observing the following facts .",
    "first , the eigenvalues of @xmath32 are non - negative , because for any eigenstate we can write @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a complete orthonormal set of eigenstates .",
    "second , we can construct the orthonormal set of eigenstates of @xmath32 as @xmath36^{1/2 } ( { \\tilde b}_{\\bf k}^{\\dag})^n    @xmath37 , where the fock vacuum @xmath38 satisfies @xmath39 .",
    "it is interesting to point out that the state @xmath40 possesses the on - site off - diagonal long - range order ( odlro ) in the two - particle reduced density matrix when @xmath41 is on the order of @xmath16 .",
    "one may easily examine that @xmath42 . since @xmath41 ( @xmath43 ) is integers , it is possible that , in the infinite volume ( i.e. , @xmath44 ) , the eigenvalues @xmath45 in the given @xmath46 state can be taken as @xmath47 with the degeneracy being @xmath48 . for the noninteracting system of the tightly bound electron pairs with the single - particle dispersion @xmath49",
    ", it seems that one can get the average occupation number per volume @xmath50 in the following way : @xmath51 with @xmath52 the chemical potential of the tightly bound electron pairs .",
    "if this formula is correct , the bec will appear in this system , like the usual ideal bose gas .",
    "unfortunately , when one looks carefully at eq .",
    "( [ average ] ) , one may find it incorrect .",
    "the reasoning is as follows .",
    "equation ( [ average ] ) implies that the hamiltonian for this noninteracting system is of the form @xmath53 which looks apparently like the conventional noninteracting bose system .",
    "however , when considering the fact that the operator @xmath32 does not commute with the hamiltonian of this form owing to @xmath54 \\neq 0 $ ] for @xmath55 , suggesting that the hamiltonian can not be diagonalized by the eigenstates of @xmath32 , one may observe that the first equality of eq .",
    "( [ average ] ) is not justified .",
    "this could also be easily understood if we loosely treat the bound electron pairs as pseudospins and thereby the system as the xy model .",
    "therefore , it might be reasonable to believe that the noninteracting tightly bound electron pairs in momentum space could not _ directly _ undergo the bec in the usual ( or strict ) sense that the bec is a phenomenon for the noninteracting bose systems@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "as advocated by a number of people , there must be a crossover from the bcs theory to the bec of the tightly bound electron pairs based on qualitative arguments associated with approximate calculations . naively speaking ,",
    "this is certainly sound , because if the attractive interactions between electrons are strong enough , the tightly bound electron pairs are formed , and the low - lying states of the system are thus occupied by electron pairs , which might have a macroscopic occupation at a certain quantum state due to the bosonic nature of these pairs . how to reconcile these facts ?",
    "actually , from our point of view the tightly bound electron pairs or cooper pairs can not undergo the bec themselves directly , but their fluctuations probably can .",
    "these fluctuations can be constructed as genuine bosons through some kind of nonlinear transformations@xcite , in which pauli s exclusion principle seemingly no longer plays a role in the formalism .",
    "consequently , owing to the genuinely bosonic statistical property of these quasiparticles the bec of the fluctuations appear to be possible .",
    "emery and kivelson have recently presented a nice example , similar in spirit to this argument , in which they assumed that the superconducting order parameter of a metal , with an amplitude and a phase , is complex , and emphasized the importance of phase fluctuations in superconductors with small superfluid density@xcite . here",
    "we shall offer an alternative realisation .",
    "we introduce two kinds of bosons by which a tightly bound electron pair can be constituted . to this aim",
    ", we define @xmath56 where the operators @xmath57 and @xmath58 are of bosons , satisfying the standard commutation relations : @xmath59 = [ a_{i } , a_{j}^{\\dag } ] = \\delta_{ij}$ ] and @xmath60=[f_{i}^{\\dag } , f_{j}^{\\dag}]=$ ] @xmath61=[a_{i}^{\\dag } , a_{j}^{\\dag}]=0 $ ] . in addition",
    ", they commute each other , namely @xmath62=0 $ ] .",
    "these bosons are hard - core bosons , obeying @xmath63 with @xmath64 the number operator of the respective bosons .",
    "furthermore , we impose a constraint on the two bosons : @xmath65 this condition , arising from the consistency requirement with eq.([commu - fm ] ) , implies that the two bosons can not occupy the same site .",
    "the underlying physics behind eqs . ( [ fa - hc ] ) and ( [ nfna=0 ] ) is still pauli s exclusion principle .",
    "one may check that with the above definitions all the conditions imposed on the tightly bound electron pair operators are indeed satisfied .",
    "we call the boson `` a '' as _ binon _ and the boson `` f '' as _ vacanon _ , which are actually two kinds of schwinger bosons , because the transformation ( [ trans ] ) is seemingly similar to the form in the context of angular momentum discussed long time ago by schwinger .",
    "it turns out that the number of the tightly bound electron pairs maps onto the following @xmath66 as a consequence , the total number of electrons , @xmath67 , becomes @xmath68 , where @xmath69 , is the total number of binons ( vacanons ) .",
    "this reveals that the role of the tightly bound electron pairs played in the original electron system is now replaced by that of the new hard - core quasiparticles ( i.e. binons and vacanons ) in the new system .",
    "the fermionic property of the electron pairs is reflected by the conditions ( [ fa - hc ] ) and ( [ nfna=0 ] ) . as can be seen",
    ", this transformation is actually a _ projection _ procedure , which maps the whole hilbert space @xmath70 spanned by all the states of the tightly bound electron pairs onto the hilbert subspace @xmath71 spanned by those of the new bosons with the constraint that the two kinds of schwinger bosons can not occupy the same site .",
    "the projection operator @xmath72 can be defined such that @xmath73 @xmath74 , and @xmath73 @xmath75 with the hamiltonian @xmath76 . the transformation defined in eq .",
    "( [ trans ] ) just gives a possible manifestation of @xmath72 .",
    "it is in some sense very similar to the projection made in the context of the t - j model where the doubly - occupied sites are projected out .",
    "we could remark here that the bose quasiparticles ( binons and vacanons ) in the system of the tightly bound electron pairs are somewhat in analogy with the magnons in magnetic systems .",
    "the vacanon is an auxiliary bose field by which the commutators for operators @xmath77 are guranteed . for the fock vacuum @xmath38 , we have @xmath78 and @xmath79 . by definition , we observe @xmath80 this is the intrinsic difference between the two schwinger bosons .",
    "the vacanon can be understood as a kind of empty or vacancy on the lattice in the sense that it can not be destructed in vacuum@xcite .",
    "since a tightly bound electron pair carries spin zero and electric charge 2 , namely , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , we have @xmath83 and @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the z - component of the spin-1/2 operator , and use has been made of conditions ( [ af-0 ] ) .",
    "this shows that _ a binon also carries spin zero and electric charge 2_. it is not difficult to verify that a vacanon carries both charge and spin zero . in this way",
    ", the hopping of a tightly bound electron pair on a lattice from the site @xmath86 to the site @xmath6 is equivalent to the hopping of a binon from the site @xmath86 to the site @xmath6 while accompanying the hopping of a vacanon from the site @xmath6 to the site @xmath86 , as depicted in fig.1 .",
    "this makes the separation of the genuinely charged hard - core bosonic degrees of freedom and the vacant states originally implied in the system of the tightly bound electron pairs .",
    "note that the hopping occurs only between the occupied and unoccupied sites .",
    "let us discuss briefly the physical meaning of the binon .",
    "it is readily checked that the following commutators hold : @xmath87 = [ b_{i } , f_{i}^{\\dag}]= [ b_{i}^{\\dag } , f_{i } ] = [ b_{i}^{\\dag } , a_{i}^{\\dag } ] = 0,$ ] @xmath88 = - a_{i}$ ] , @xmath89= f_{i}^{\\dag}$ ] , @xmath90 = - f_{i}$ ] , @xmath91 = a_{i}^{\\dag}$ ] . in momentum space",
    ", we have @xmath92 where we have supposed that the fourier transforms of the schwinger bosons have the same form as electrons .",
    "since the boson operator @xmath93 produces empty or vacant states , eq .",
    "( [ a_k ] ) shows that the binon is a kind of quantum fluctuations of the tightly bound electron pairs .",
    "this observation is quite consistent with the crude belief that the formation of the tightly bound electron pairs is a quantum fluctuation in the context of a continuum model and the attractive hubbard model@xcite . here",
    ", we have mathematically presented a possible and explicit description for such fluctuations . by comparing the corresponding fourier transforms",
    "we could obtain the relationship between binons , vacanons and electrons : @xmath94 and @xmath95 $ ] where @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "equation ( [ nfna=0 ] ) gives the condition @xmath98 with @xmath99 .",
    "the vacanon is supposed to obey @xmath100 $ ] and @xmath101 $ ] . to this end",
    ", we could say that the bosons involved in the tightly bound electron pairs could be identified as binons and vacanons which are actually responsible for the bec phenomenon in the system .",
    "although the concept of binons and vacanons is developed on the basis of the noninteracting tightly bound electron pairs , we anticipate that it would be applicable to interacting electrons , bipolarons , and other systems .",
    "it is known that the attractive hubbard model in the strong coupling limit bears the form@xcite @xmath102 which is valid for arbitrary band filling , where @xmath103 with @xmath104 the chemical potential of electrons , can be viewed as the effective chemical potential , and @xmath105 .",
    "hereafter we suppose @xmath106 . in terms of the terminology of binons and vacanons ,",
    "this hamiltonian can be rewritten as @xmath107 consequently , the attractive hubbard model with strong coupling is mapped onto a coupled bose system with binons and vacanons subject to the constraints mentioned before . the first term denotes the hopping process of binons and vacanons , as shown in fig.1 , while the second sum shows the interactions between binons and vacanons . in momentum space",
    ", the hamiltonian reads @xmath108 where @xmath109 ( @xmath110 is the vector connecting the nearest - neighbor lattice sites if we assume @xmath111 for @xmath112 being nearest neighbors and zero otherwise ) , and @xmath113 ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "one may observe that the bec phenonmenon in the attractive hubbard model with strong coupling can thus be explored on the basis of the above hamiltonian in the restricted hilbert subspace where the binons and vacanons can not occupy the same site .",
    "since this is a kind of interacting hard - core bose gas , some approximations will be necessary .",
