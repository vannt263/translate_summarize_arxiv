    "thus a complete symmetry exists of the gravitational interaction of the two masses onto each other .",
    "let us now distinguish the mass @xmath1 as field  generating active gravitational mass and @xmath2 as ( point  like ) passive test  mass . accordingly , we introduce a hypothetical _ gravitational field _ as describing the force per unit mass ( @xmath11 ) : @xmath12     attracts the test mass @xmath13.,width=226 ]    with this definition , the force acting on the test ",
    "mass @xmath13 is equal to _ field strength _ @xmath14 _ gravitational charge _",
    "( mass ) or @xmath15 , in analogy to electrodynamics .",
    "the active gravitational mass @xmath16 is thought to emanate a gravitational field which is always directed to the center of @xmath16 and has the same magnitude on every sphere with @xmath16 as center , see fig .  [ fig2 ] .",
    "let us now investigate the properties of the gravitational field ( [ chap1:gravfield ] ) .",
    "obviously , there exists a potential @xmath17 accordingly , the gravitational field is curl - free : @xmath18 .    by assumption",
    "it is clear that the source of the gravitational field is the mass @xmath16 .",
    "we find , indeed , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the 3-dimensional ( 3d ) delta function . by means of the _ laplace operator _ @xmath21",
    ", we infer for the gravitational potential @xmath22 the term @xmath23 may be viewed as the mass density of a point mass .",
    "eq.([chap1:poisson1 ] ) is a 2nd order linear partial differential equation for @xmath24 .",
    "thus the gravitational potential generated by several point masses is simply the linear superposition of the respective single potentials .",
    "hence we can generalize the _ poisson equation _ ( [ chap1:poisson1 ] ) straightforwardly to a continuous matter distribution @xmath25 : @xmath26 this equation interrelates the source @xmath27 of the gravitational field with the gravitational potential @xmath24 and thus completes the quasi - field theoretical description of newton s gravitational theory .",
    "we speak here of _",
    "quasi_field theoretical because the field @xmath24 as such represents a convenient concept .",
    "however , it has no _ dynamical _ properties , no genuine degrees of freedom .",
    "the newtonian gravitational theory is an _ action at a distance _ theory ( also called _ mass - interaction theory _ ) .",
    "when we remove the source , the field vanishes instantaneously .",
    "newton himself was very unhappy about this consequence .",
    "therefore , he emphasized the preliminary and purely descriptive character of his theory .",
    "but before we liberate the gravitational field from this constraint by equipping it with its own degrees of freedom within the framework of general relativity theory , we turn to some properties of the newtonian theory .",
    "a very peculiar fact characteristic to the gravitational field is that the acceleration of a freely falling test - body does not depend on the mass of this body but only on its position within the gravitational field .",
    "this comes about because of the equality ( in suitable units ) of the gravitational and the inertial mass : @xmath28 this equality has been well tested since galileo s time by means of pendulum and other experiments with an ever increasing accuracy , see will  @xcite .",
    "in order to allow for a more detailed description of the structure of a gravitational field , we introduce the concept of _ tidal force_. this can be best illustrated by means of fig .",
    "[ chap1:tidal ] . in a spherically symmetric gravitational field , for example ,",
    "two test - masses will fall radially towards the center and thereby get closer and closer . similarly , a spherical drop of water is deformed to an ellipsoidal shape because the gravitational force at its bottom is bigger than at its top , which has a greater distance to the source .        if the distance between two freely falling test masses",
    "is relatively small , we can derive an explicit expression for their relative acceleration by means of a taylor expansion . consider two mass points with position vectors @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "then the relative acceleration reads @xmath31    = \\delta{{\\mathbf r } } \\bm{\\cdot } ( \\bm{\\nabla f})\\,.\\ ] ] we may rewrite this according to ( the sign is conventional , @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) @xmath34 we call @xmath35 the _ tidal force _ matrix .",
    "the vanishing curl of the gravitational field is equivalent to its symmetry , @xmath36 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath37 .",
    "thus , the poisson equation becomes , @xmath38 accordingly , in vacuum @xmath35 is trace - free .",
    "let us now investigate the gravitational potential of a homogeneous _ star _ with constant mass density @xmath39 and total mass @xmath40 .",
    "for our sun , the radius is @xmath41 and the total mass is @xmath42 .",
    "outside the sun ( in the idealized picture we are using here ) , we have vacuum .",
    "accordingly , @xmath43 for @xmath44 .",
    "then the poisson equation reduces to the _ laplace equation _",
    "@xmath45 in 3d polar coordinates , the @xmath46-dependent part of the laplacian has the form @xmath47 .",
    "thus ( [ chap1:laplace ] ) has the solution @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are integration constants . requiring that the potential tends to zero as @xmath46 goes to infinity",
    ", we get @xmath51 .",
    "the integration constant @xmath49 will be determined from the requirement that the force should change smoothly as we cross the star s surface , that is , the interior and exterior potential and their first derivatives have to be matched continuously at @xmath52 .",

    "<S> starting from newton s gravitational theory , we give a general introduction into the spherically symmetric solution of einstein s vacuum field equation , the schwarzschild(-droste ) solution , and into one specific stationary axially symmetric solution , the kerr solution . </S>",
    "<S> the schwarzschild solution is unique and its metric can be interpreted as the exterior gravitational field of a spherically symmetric mass . </S>",
    "<S> the kerr solution is only unique if the multipole moments of its mass and its angular momentum take on prescribed values . </S>",
    "<S> its metric can be interpreted as the exterior gravitational field of a suitably rotating mass distribution . </S>",
    "<S> both solutions describe objects exhibiting an _ event horizon _ , a frontier of no return . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding notion of a black hole is explained to some extent . </S>",
    "<S> eventually , we present some generalizations of the kerr solution .    </S>",
