    "recently , thanks to the discovery of a number of realistic materials of topological semimetals @xcite , there is a growing passion on their electronic transport @xcite and signatures of the chiral anomaly @xcite .    earlier theories on the longitudinal magnetoconductivity arrived at various results @xcite . in the semiclassical limit , where the landau levels are not well formed , a positive @xmath0 magnetoconductivity was predicted @xcite , and is under intensive experimental investigation recently @xcite . in the semiclassical approaches",

    "more importantly , the weyl nodes always appear in pairs .",
    "the intrinsic connection of the weyl nodes and the inter - node scattering are two factors to affect the transport properties because the chiral anomaly occurs between two weyl nodes .    in this work ,",
    "we start with a two - node model to investigate both the longitudinal and transverse magnetoconductivity of a weyl semimetal near the weyl nodes .",
    "the model describes a pair of weyl nodes , and is solvable in the presence of magnetic fields .",
    "the scattering potential of the impurities is modeled by using a random gaussian potential , in which the range of potential may vary in realistic materials .",
    "as long as the potential range is finite , we show that the longitudinal magnetoconductivity is positive and linear in magnetic field , giving rises to a negative magnetoresistance .",
    "as the field goes to zero , we have a finite minimum conductivity , even though the density of states ( dos ) vanishes at the weyl nodes . in the transverse magnetoconductivity",

    "figure  [ fig : dos ] shows how the dos in the absence of the magnetic field evolves into a set of diverging peaks in the presence of the magnetic field .",

    "at sufficiently low temperatures , i.e. , @xmath99 , and not far away from the weyl nodes , the electronic transport can be effectively conducted by the 0th bands of landau levels .",
    "when the electric and magnetic fields are in parallel with each other , the changing rate of density of charge carriers near one node is maximal according to the picture of chiral anomaly . in this case",
    ", the semiclassical conductivity of the 0th landau bands can be found with the help of the standard green function formulism @xcite .",
    "alternatively , it can be simply figured out by using the einstein relation @xmath100 where the dos can be found as the landau degeneracy times the dos of one - dimensional systems , i.e. , @xmath101 .",

    "the gaussian potential allows us to study the effect of the potential range in a controllable way , which we find it crucial in the present study .",
    "now we have two characteristic lengths , the potential range @xmath113 and the magnetic length @xmath114 , which define two regimes , the long - range potential regime @xmath115 and the short - range potential limit @xmath116 .",
