    "the standard hot big bang model of nucleosynthesis ( sbbn ) is one of the key quantitative tests of big bang cosmology , along with the hubble expansion and the cosmic microwave background radiation . in the sbbn ,",
    "four light isotopes , d , @xmath15he , @xmath2he and @xmath16li , were produced by nuclear reactions a few minutes after the birth of the universe . given the number of relativistic neutrino species and the neutron lifetime , the abundances of these light elements depend on one cosmological parameter only , the baryon - to - photon ratio @xmath9 , which in turn is directly related to the density of ordinary baryonic matter @xmath13 .",
    "the ratio of any two primordial abundances , for example that of d to h gives @xmath9 , and accurate measurements of the other three light elements , for example @xmath2he / h , tests sbbn .    of all light elements ,",
    "the abundance of deuterium ( d ) is the most sensitive to the baryonic density .",
    "the primordial d abundance can be measured directly in low - metallicity absorption line systems in the spectra of high - redshift quasars .",
    "the quasar is used as a background light source , and the nearly primordial gas doing the absorbing is in the outer regions of intervening galaxies or in the intergalactic medium ( the so - called lyman @xmath17 clouds ) .",
    "tytler and his group ( see tytler et al .",
    "2000 for a review ) have vigorously pursued this type of measurements .",
    "they have now obtained d / h measurements in the line of sight towards 4 quasars . combining all measurements",
    ", they found all their data are consistent with a single primordial value of the d / h ratio : ( d / h)@xmath18 = 3.0@xmath40.4@xmath1110@xmath19 ( omeara et al . 2001 ) .",
    "this latest value is about 10% lower than their previous value ( d / h)@xmath18 = 3.39@xmath40.25@xmath1110@xmath20 ( burles & tytler 1998 ) .",
    "the primordial abundance of @xmath15he is also quite sensitive to the baryon density , though less than the d abundance .",
    "it has not been yet measured , mainly because low - mass stars make a lot of @xmath15he , increasing its value in the interstellar medium of the milky way well above the primordial value .",
    "furthermore , the amount of @xmath15he destroyed in stars is unknown .",
    "bania , rood & balser ( 2000 ) have measured an average @xmath15he / h = 1.5@xmath40.6@xmath1110@xmath20 in galactic h ii regions .",
    "this value represents the average in the interstellar medium of the milky way , but there exists no good way to extrapolate the @xmath15he abundance to the primordial value .",
    "old halo stars that formed from nearly pristine gas with very low iron abundances during the gravitational collapse of the milky way show approximately constant @xmath16li / h ( the so called `` spite plateau '' , spite & spite 1982 ) , implying that their @xmath16li is nearly primordial . creation or depletion of @xmath16li",
    "may make the @xmath16li abundances of halo stars deviate from the primordial value .",
    "creation of @xmath16li in the interstellar medium by cosmic ray spallation prior to the formation of the milky way has to be less than 1020% , so as not to produce more be than is observed ( ryan , norris & beers 1999 ) .",
    "there is still considerable debate concerning the possible depletion of @xmath16li at the surface of stars .",
    "depletion mechanisms that have been proposed include mixing due to rotation or gravity waves , mass loss in stellar winds and gravitational settling .",
    "depending on the exact depletion mechanism , the primordial lithium abundance varies from ( @xmath16li / h)@xmath18 = ( 1.73@xmath40.21)@xmath1110@xmath12 ( bonifacio & molaro 1997 ) to ( 2.24@xmath40.57)@xmath1110@xmath12 ( vauclair & charbonnel 1998 ) , to ( 3.9@xmath40.85)@xmath1110@xmath12 ( pinsonneault et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "because of the relatively large uncertainties in the determination of the primordial abundances of @xmath15he and @xmath16li , the primordial abundance of @xmath2he plays a key role for deriving @xmath13 independently of d measurements , and is crucial for checking the consistency of sbbn .",
    "we discuss next how the primordial @xmath2he mass fraction @xmath3 is determined , and the uncertainties which enter in such a determination .",
    "because of the relative insensitivity of @xmath2he production to the baryonic density of matter , @xmath3 needs to be determined to a precision of about one percent to provide useful cosmological constraints .",
    "this precision can in principle be achieved by obtaining high signal - to - noise ratio spectra of a class of star - forming dwarf galaxies called blue compact dwarf ( bcd ) galaxies .",
    "these are low - luminosity ( @xmath21 @xmath22 18 ) systems undergoing an intense burst of star formation in a very compact region ( less than 1 kpc ) which dominates the light of the galaxy and which shows blue colors and a h ii region - like emission - line optical spectrum ( thuan & izotov 1998a ) .",
    "bcds are ideal laboratories in which to measure the primordial @xmath2he abundance because , with an oxygen abundance o / h ranging between 1/50 and 1/3 that of the sun , bcds are among the most metal - deficient gas - rich galaxies known .",
    "their gas has not been processed through many generations of stars , and thus best approximates the pristine primordial gas .",
    "izotov & thuan ( 1999 ) have argued that bcds with o / h less than @xmath1 1/20 that of the sun may be genuine young galaxies , with ages less than several 100 myr .",
    "thus @xmath3 can be derived accurately in very metal - deficient bcds with only a small correction for helium made in stars . moreover , the theory of nebular emission is well understood enough to allow to convert he emission - line strengths into abundances with the desired accuracy .",
    "@xmath3 is generally determined by linear extrapolation of the correlations @xmath0o / h and @xmath0n / h to o / h",
    "= n / h = 0 as first proposed by peimbert & torres - peimbert ( 1974 ) , where @xmath0 , n / h and o / h are respectively the @xmath2he mass fraction , the oxygen and nitrogen abundances relative to hydrogen of a sample of dwarf irregular and bcd galaxies . based on a relatively large sample of @xmath1 45 bcds , we ( izotov , thuan & lipovetsky 1994 , 1997 , hereafter itl94 , itl 97 ; izotov & thuan 1998 , hereafter it98 ) have obtained @xmath3= 0.2443@xmath40.0015 with d@xmath0/d@xmath5 = 2.4@xmath41.0 ( see thuan & izotov 1998b , 2000 for reviews ) .",
    "this result is quite robust as it is in excellent agreement with the average @xmath3= 0.2452@xmath40.0015 ( izotov et al .",
    "1999 ) determined in the two most metal - deficient bcds known , i zw 18 ( @xmath6/50 ) and sbs 0335052 ( @xmath6/41 ) , where the correction for he production is smallest .",
    "the quoted statistical error ( 1@xmath7 ) is @xmath8 1% because of the high quality of the spectra and the large size of the sample .",
    "our derived value of @xmath3 is significantly higher than those of 0.228@xmath40.005 by pagel et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , of 0.234@xmath40.002 obtained by olive , steigman & skillman ( 1997 ) , of 0.2345@xmath40.0026 by peimbert , peimbert & ruiz ( 2000 ) and of 0.2384@xmath40.0025 by peimbert , peimbert & luridiana ( 2001 ) .",
    "these values are lower than ours by several times the quoted statistical error and lead to very different cosmological consequences .",
    "this implies that systematic effects in the determination of @xmath3 play an important role and need to be considered carefully to achieve the desired accuracy .",
    "we discuss the most important systematic effects below , specifically in the two most metal - deficient bcds known , i zw 18 and sbs 0335052 . because different systematic effects are at play in these two objects , they allow to illustrate the relative importance of each nicely .",
    "one possible systematic effect may be due to the adopted interstellar extinction curve .",
    "we use the galactic extinction curve by whitford ( 1958 ) .",
    "there is evidence that the extinction curve does change when metallicity decreases , being steeper at short wavelengths ( e.g. rocca - volmerange et al .",
    "1981 ) , but the changes are mainly in the ultraviolet and are small in the optical range . relying mainly on the three balmer line ratios h@xmath17/h@xmath23 , h@xmath24/h@xmath23 and h@xmath25/h@xmath23 ,",
    "we have adopted an iterative procedure to derive simultaneously both the extinction and the absorption equivalent width for the hydrogen lines assumed to be the same for all lines ( itl94 ) .",
    "since the derived extinction correction is applied to the he i lines , any uncertainty in it will propagate in the derivation of the final he abundance .",
    "a stringent observational check for the adequacy of the extinction curve is the good agreement between the corrected intensities of the balmer hydrogen emission lines and the theoretical values for hydrogen recombination line intensities . using monte - carlo simulations of the hydrogen balmer ratios , olive & skillman ( 2001 )",
    "estimate the uncertainties in the reddening corrections to be about 12 % for the blue he lines and 34 % for the red ones",
    ". however , the uncertainties for the red lines can be substantially less if the corrected h@xmath17/h@xmath23 ratio matches the theoretical ratio .",
    "underlying stellar absorption in he i lines caused by hot stars can decrease the intensities of nebular he i lines .",
    "model calculations of synthetic absorption line strengths in star forming regions by olofsson ( 1995 ) show that the equivalent widths of he i absorption lines decrease as the starburst ages .",
    "furthermore , the dependence of he i equivalent widths on metallicity is small , and the equivalent width of the he i 4471 absorption line can be as high as 0.35 .",
    "unfortunately , similar calculations for other important lines used in the determination of @xmath3 such as he i 5876 , 6678 and 7065 are not yet available .",
    "the effect of underlying he i stellar absorption is most important for the emission lines with the smallest equivalent widths .",
    "therefore , the he i 5876 emission line which has the largest equivalent width is the least affected by such absorption , while the he i 4471 emission line is the most affected because of its low equivalent width , the effect of underlying absorption being 510 times larger for it than for the 5876 line .",
    "figure 1 shows the spectra of the 2 brightest centers of star formation in i zw 18 , the nw and se components , with the he i lines marked .",
    "it is clear that the nw component suffers far more stellar absorption than the se one : all marked he i lines of the se component are in emission while the two he i 4026 and 4921 lines are in absorption and the he i 4471 line is hardly detected in the nw component , its intensity being decreased by a factor of @xmath1 2 ( izotov et al . 1999 ) .",
    "however , the strong he i absorption in the nw component of i zw 18 constitutes the exception rather than the rule .",
    "it is relatively less important in other very metal - deficient bcds , such as sbs 0335052 , because the equivalent widths of their he i emission lines are considerably larger than those of the nw component of i zw 18 .",
    "this can be seen in figure 2 which compares the spatial distributions of the he i nebular emission line equivalent widths ( @xmath26 ) in i zw 18 and sbs 0335052 . while the maximum @xmath26s of the he i emission lines in the se component of i zw 18 are close to those in the central brightest part of sbs 0335052 , the he i line @xmath26s in the nw component of i zw 18 are several times smaller .",
    "the largest ratio of minimum values of equivalent widths in i zw 18 as compared to in sbs 0335052 is @xmath1 14 for the 4471 line .",
    "the effect of underlying stellar absorption is smaller for the other he i lines because of their higher equivalent widths .",
    "thus for the 6678 line , izotov et al .",
    "( 1999 ) estimate it to be @xmath1 5% in the nw component of i zw 18 , but to be less than 1% in its se component and in sbs 0335052 . as for the 5876 line ,",
    "it is less than 0.4% in sbs 0335052 ( it is contaminated by the galactic na i 5890 line in i zw 18 , so is unusable ) .",
    "it was mainly because the importance of underlying he i stellar absorption was insufficiently recognized in the nw component of i zw 18 that led to the low @xmath3 values of pagel et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and olive et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .    in our work",
    "thus far , we have not corrected self - consistently for underlying he i self - absorption .",
    "we have simply not used regions where underlying absorption is important ( such as the nw component in i zw 18 ) , or not averaged in lines that give a @xmath0 clearly deviant from the @xmath0s from other lines .",
    "thus , in the case of sbs 0335052 , figure 3a shows that the @xmath0 obtained from he i 4471 line is systematically below the values from the he i 5876 and 6678 lines .",
    "it is affected by underlying absorption and is not included . in the future ,",
    "we plan to solve for he i absorption ( assumed to be the same for all he i lines ) self - consistently , as we did for the h i lines ( see below ) .",
    "line ratios corrected for reddening and absorption are converted to he / h abundance ratios by using theoretical emissivities calculated from recombination and radiative cascade theory .",
    "we use the h i emissivities of brocklehurst ( 1971 ) which are in excellent agreement with the more recent ones by hummer & storey ( 1987 ) for the range of temperatures and densities in metal - deficient bcds , and the he i emissivities of smits ( 1996 ) .",
    "benjamin , skillman & smits ( 1999 ) have estimated that uncertainties in the theoretical he i emissivities can be as large as 1.5% , @xmath1 3 times worse than the accuracy expected from comparing brocklehurst ( 1972 ) and smits ( 1996 ) emissivities .      to determine element abundances",
    ", we adopt a two - zone photoionized h ii region model ( itl94,itl97,it98 ) : a high - ionization zone with temperature @xmath27(o iii ) , where the o iii , ne iii and ar iv lines originate , and a low - ionization zone with temperature @xmath27(o ii ) , where the o ii , n ii , s ii and fe iii lines originate . as for the ar iii and s iii lines",
    "they originate in the intermediate zone between the high and low - ionization regions .",
    "the [ s ii ] @xmath286717/@xmath286731 line ratio is used to determine the electron density @xmath29(s ii ) according to five - level atom calculations .",
    "previous authors have set @xmath29(he ii ) = @xmath29(s ii ) .",
    "however , this is not appropriate as @xmath29(s ii ) measures the density in the low - ionization zone , while he ii is produced in the high - ionization zone .",
    "furthermore , the [ s ii ] ratio is fairly insensitive for densities below 100 @xmath30 .",
    "thus it is much better to determine @xmath29(he ii ) directly from the he i lines themselves , in a self - consistent manner , which we have done . because the electron density enters linearily in the calculation of the correction for collisional enhancement of the he i emission lines ( see below ) ,",
    "its different estimate by us and previous authors is also responsible for the difference between our @xmath3 and theirs .",
    "it is also generally assumed that case b recombination theory holds , i.e that the line photons ( usually resonance lines of abundant ions ) are scattered so many times that their downward radiative transitions can effectively be neglected . in other words ,",
    "the h ii regions are considered to be optically thick in the lyman transitions but optically thin in the other transitions of both hydrogen and helium atoms .",
    "( the opposite assumption , case a , where all emitted photons escape without absorption and there is no radiative transfer problem , does not apply to nebulae with large enough amounts of gas and optical depths to be seen ) .",
    "however , there are known physical effects that make the helium lines deviate from case b. one such effect is the collisional excitation of the balmer hydrogen lines by thermal electrons .",
    "this process and its effect on the determination of @xmath3 was first discussed by davidson and kinman ( 1985 ) .",
    "low - metallicity h ii regions have high enough electron temperatures so that the observed fluxes of lines like h@xmath17 may be overestimated by this effect , leading to an underestimate of @xmath31 .",
    "davidson & kinman ( 1985 ) estimated crudely this effect to be @xmath1 2% for i zw 18 .",
    "sasselov & goldwirth ( 1995 ) examined this effect with detailed radiative transfer calculations and also found it to cause an increase of @xmath1 2% in the @xmath0 of i zw 18 and up to 3% for other metal - deficient bcds .",
    "stasiska & izotov ( 2001 ) used a grid of photoionization models to show that the effect of collisional excitation on the h@xmath17/h@xmath23 ratio can be as high as 8% , resulting in an upward correction in @xmath0 of up to 5% in objects like sbs 0335052 .",
    "thus this effect can be one of the most important sources of systematics in the determination of @xmath3 .",
    "in the high range of electron temperatures found in metal - deficient bcds ( 1000020000 k ) , collisional excitation from the metastable level 2 @xmath15s level of he i can be important in populating the higher levels and making the he i line intensities deviate from pure recombination values .",
    "another effect that also leads to deviation from pure recombination values is self - absorption in some optically thick emission lines which populates the upper levels of he i , a mechanism called fluorescence .",
    "the emission lines most sensitive to fluorescence in the optical range are the he i 3889 and 7065 lines .",
    "the he i 7065 also plays an important role because it is particularly density sensitive .",
    "in contrast to collisional excitation , which increases the line intensities of all he i lines , the fluorescent mechanism decreases the intensity of the he i 3889 line as its optical depth increases , while increasing the intensities of the he i 4471 , 5876 , 6678 , and 7065 lines .    how do these two effects play out in i zw 18 and sbs 0335052 ?",
    "they are less important in i zw 18 than in sbs 0335052 because the physical conditions in the two bcds are quite different . while in i",
    "zw 18 the electron number density is small ( @xmath29(s ii ) @xmath32 100 @xmath30 ) and collisional enhancement has a minor effect on the derived helium abundance , the electron number density in sbs 0335052 is considerably higher ( @xmath29(s ii ) @xmath1 500 @xmath30 in the central part of the h ii region ) .",
    "additionally , the linear size of the h ii region in sbs 0335052 is @xmath1 5 times larger than in i zw 18 , making it optically thick for some he i transitions .",
    "therefore , both collisional and fluorescent enhancements of he i emission lines play a significant role in this galaxy ( izotov et al .",
    "figure 4 shows that the spatial distribution of he i emission line intensities in sbs 0335052 is very different from that in i zw 18 .",
    "the increase of he i 5876 and he i 7065 emission line strengths by @xmath1 20% and @xmath1 75% respectively in the central part of sbs 0335052 within a radius @xmath1 2  is caused by collisional and fluorescent enhancement .",
    "the increase of the he  i @xmath286678 emission line intensity is only @xmath32 4% .",
    "the combined effect of collisional enhancement and underlying stellar absorption results in a small depression in the he i 4471 intensity in the central region .",
    "as for i zw 18 , the main effect is underlying he i stellar absorption causing the dip in the he i emission line intensities at the location of the nw component .",
    "to correct the he i line intensities for collisional enhancement , we use the correction factors calculated by kingdon & ferland ( 1995 ) based on collisional rates by sawey & berrington ( 1993 ) . to correct the he i line intensities for fluorescent enhancement ,",
    "we have fitted the robbins ( 1968 ) correction factors with polynomials as given in it98 .",
    "since the collisional enhancement factor of the he i lines depend exponentially on the electron temperature and linearly on the electron density @xmath29 ( he ii ) , we correct for these two effects and determine @xmath29 ( he ii ) at the same time , in a self - consistent way so that the he i 5876/4471 , 6678/4471 , and 7065/4471 line ratios have their recombination values , after correction for both collisional and fluorescent enhancement .      depending on the hardness of the ionizing radiation , the radius of the he@xmath33 sphere can be smaller or larger than the radius of the h@xmath33 sphere .",
    "when the ionizing radiation is soft , the first case prevails , it is necessary to consider the presence of unseen neutral helium in the h@xmath33 zone and a correction needs to be made , resulting in a higher he abundance . on the other hand , if the ionizing radiation is hard , the second case holds , there is neutral hydrogen in the he@xmath33 zone , which results in a downward correction of the he abundance . the correction in @xmath0",
    "can be as high as several percent , either upward or downward ( e.g. steigman , viegas & gruenwald 1997 , peimbert , peimbert & ruiz 2000 , sauer & jedamzik 2001 ) .",
    "the hardness of the radiation is usually characterized by the `` radiation softness parameter '' @xmath9 defined by vlchez & pagel ( 1988 ) as @xmath34 , and the ionization parameter @xmath35 . for",
    "both i zw 18 and sbs 0335052 , the ionizing radiation is hard , and the correction to @xmath0 is downward . using the extensive grid of correction factors as functions of @xmath9 and @xmath35 , calculated by sauer & jedamzik ( 2001 ) using photoionized h ii region models , we found the downward correction to be less than 1% for both bcds .      to convert the he i line intensities into abundances , we have set the electron temperature @xmath27(he ii ) to be equal to @xmath27(o iii ) as obtained from the [ o iii ] 4363 / ( 4959 + 5007 ) ratio .",
    "however as emphasized by peimbert , peimbert & ruiz ( 2000 ) , detailed modeling of bcds like i zw 18 ( stasiska & schaerer 1999 ) and examination of photoionization models ( stasiska 1990 ) suggest that @xmath27(he ii ) is smaller than @xmath27(o iii ) by at least 5% in this type of object ( deviations from a constant temperature are sometime called `` temperature fluctuations '' ) .",
    "peimbert , peimbert & luridiana ( 2001 ) found that this leads to a downward correction of y of about 3% .",
    "however , examination of the correction factors for temperature effects derived by sauer & jedamzik ( 2001 ) using photoionization models give downward corrections of y that are considerably smaller for i zw 18 and sbs 0335052 , less than 1% .",
    "in summary , the important systematic effects that may affect our determination of @xmath3 from spectra of the two most metal - deficient bcds known , i zw 18 ( the se component ) and sbs 0335052 , and that have not been taken into account by our self - consistent procedure are : 1 ) the collisional excitation of hydrogen lines that can increase @xmath3 by up to 5% ; 2 ) the non - coincidence of the h@xmath33 and he@xmath33 zones that may decrease @xmath31 by @xmath1 1% ; 3 ) the temperature fluctuations that may decrease it by @xmath1 1  3% ; and 4 ) underlying stellar he i absorption that may increase it by @xmath1 1% .",
    "thus , combining all those systematic effects , our @xmath3 value may be underestimated by as much as @xmath1 2",
    " 4% .    taken at face value , our @xmath3 = 0.2452@xmath40.0015 implies a baryon - to - photon number ratio @xmath9 = ( 4.7@xmath10)@xmath1110@xmath12 .",
    "this translates to a baryon mass fraction @xmath13@xmath14 = 0.017@xmath40.005 ( 2@xmath7 ) where @xmath36 is the hubble constant in units of 100 km s@xmath37mpc@xmath37 .",
    "this value is consistent with the one of 0.020@xmath40.002 ( 2@xmath7 ) derived from the primordial deuterium abundance measured in high - redshift hydrogen clouds backlit by distant quasars ( omeara et al .",
    "2001 ) , vindicating sbbn .",
    "it is also consistent with the baryon mass fraction @xmath13@xmath14 = 0.022@xmath40.003 ( 1@xmath7 ) inferred from measurements of the angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb , netterfield et al .",
    "note that correcting upward @xmath3 by 24% would bring it into even better agreement with the deuterium and cmb measurements .",
    "it is clear from the previous discussion that , to decrease or eliminate the main systematic effects in the determination of @xmath3 , it is best to determine all the four following quantities  the electron density @xmath29 ( he ii ) and temperature @xmath27 ( he ii ) of the he ii zone , the optical depth @xmath38 ( 3889 ) in the he i 3889 line , and the equivalent width for underlying he i absorption  in a totally self - consistent manner .",
    "itl94 , itl97 and it98 have used the five he i 3889 , 4471 , 5876 , 6678 and 7065 lines to solve self - consistently for @xmath29 ( he ii ) and @xmath38 ( 3889 ) .",
    "we plan to add the he i 4026 , 4438 and 4922 lines , giving a total of 8 lines , to solve self - consistently for all four quantities .",
    "the last three lines are particularly sensitive to underlying he i stellar absorption .",
    "however their intensities are less than 1/10 that of the 5876 line , and very high signal - to - noise ratio spectra are needed to determine their intensities precisely .",
    "such a spectrum obtained with the keck telescope and where all 8 he i lines are marked is shown in figure 4 for the bcd sbs 0335052 .",
    "future work to improve on the determination of @xmath3 will consist of : 1 ) obtaining deep spectra for the most metal - deficient bcds known , to determine @xmath3 using a self - consistent method based on 8 lines ; 2 ) detailed modeling of bcds such as done for i zw 18 by stasiska & schaerer ( 1999 ) . it was found that a simple photoionization model is insufficient to account for the high [ o iii ] 4363/5007 ratio in i zw 18 and that an additional heating mechanism such as shock heating is necessary .",
    "such a modeling will also help to quantify potential temperature fluctuations ; and 3 ) searching for more extremely metal - deficient bcds such as i zw 18 and sbs 0335052 , to increase the number of objects where we can determine @xmath3 without a large correction for he production by stars",

    "<S> this result is in excellent agreement with the average @xmath3= 0.2452@xmath40.0015 determined in the two most metal - deficient bcds known , i zw 18 ( @xmath6/50 ) and sbs 0335052 ( @xmath6/41 ) , where the correction for he production is smallest . the quoted error ( 1@xmath7 ) of @xmath8 1% is statistical and does not include systematic effects . we examine various systematic effects including collisional excitation of hydrogen lines , ionization structure and temperature fluctuation effects , and underlying stellar he i absorption , and conclude that combining all systematic effects , our @xmath3 may be underestimated by @xmath1 24% . </S>",
    "<S> taken at face value , our @xmath3 implies a baryon - to - photon number ratio @xmath9 = ( 4.7@xmath10)@xmath1110@xmath12 and a baryon mass fraction @xmath13@xmath14 = 0.017@xmath40.005 ( 2@xmath7 ) , consistent with the values obtained from deuterium and cosmic microwave background measurements . correcting @xmath3 upward by 24% would make the agreement even better .    </S>",
