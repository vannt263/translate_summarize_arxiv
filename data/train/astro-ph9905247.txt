    "the bgk code distinguishes itself from other hydrocodes in that it has recourse to the physics which generates dissipation , namely the physics of particle collisions .",
    "developed by prendergast & xu ( 1993 ) , the hydrodynamical scheme invokes a microscopic description of gas flow and it is therefore based on considerations of gas kinetic theory . recall that kinetic - based hydrocodes rely on the fact that the state of a gas can be described by giving the distribution function of particle velocities @xmath0 at a point in the phase space of a single particle .",
    "the codes take advantage of the fact that the quantities of hydrodynamical interest ( namely the mass , momentum and energy densities in the gas ) are low - order velocity moments of @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath1 obeys the boltzmann - equation , which we write as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is a time rate of change along the trajectory of a single particle moving freely in phase space ( under the action of smoothly varying forces , if these are present ) and @xmath4 is the rate of change of @xmath1 due to collisions .",
    "the classical two - body collision integral is non - linear , and non - local in velocities ( cercignani 1988 ) .",
    "bgk ( from the names of bhatnagar - gross - krook ) replaces this integral with the term @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the maxwell - boltzmann distribution function having the same mass , momentum and energy densities as @xmath1 , and @xmath7 is a relaxation time , which can ( ideally ) be as small as the mean time between collisions of a particle in the gas ( bhatnagar , gross & krook 1954 ) .",
    "it is important to notice that @xmath1 and @xmath6 have the same mass , momentum and energy densities , but they do not give rise to the same fluxes of these quantities .",
    "fluxes are determined by different moments of the distribution functions .",
    "bgk differs from all other kinetic - based codes in several respects : the collisions are active throughout the duration of a time step , and are not imposed as a distinct `` equilibration '' process at the end of a timestep .",
    "also , we do not guess the form of the distribution function but solve the bgk equation to find it .",
    "the bgk equation is linear in @xmath1 , which makes it easy to solve if @xmath6 is known .",
    "however @xmath6 is not known ; the `` compatability '' conditions that @xmath1 and @xmath6 have the same mass , momentum and energy densities would determine @xmath6 if @xmath1 were known .",
    "therefore the bgk formulation is also nonlinear and non - local in velocity space , as is the boltzmann equation .",
    "it will be shown that this situation leads to a set of non - linear integral equations for the parameters of g. it might seem that we have made no progress by replacing the boltzmann equation by the bgk plus compatability conditions ; but this is not true , because it will be shown that we need solve for the parameters of g only in the neighborhood of a boundary between computational cells , and for a short time ( given by the usual cfl ( courant - friedrichs - lewy ) condition ) .",
    "knowledge of the parameters of @xmath6 is equivalent to knowledge of the mass , energy and momentum densities .",
    "the connection between the bgk equation s microscopic description of gas flow and a macroscopic description has been shown by cercignani ( 1988 ) for the case of a perfect monatomic gas and by xu ( 1993 ) for polyatomic gases .",
    "velocity moments of the bgk equation give the euler equations for negligible particle collision time , @xmath7 , the navier - stokes equation for small yet non - zero @xmath7 and a description of rarefied gas dynamics for large @xmath7 .",
    "in the navier - stokes regime , these derivations also furnish expressions for the shear and bulk viscosity coefficients and the heat conductivity coefficient .    in principle , if the local value of the collision time can be measured as a function of time for a gas , then the bgk scheme may be used to evolve the gas with true physical dissipation parameters . in practice ,",
    "the resolution of the bgk scheme is limited by the grid resolution .",
    "if the grid is not fine enough to resolve a discontinuity , then artificial dissipation must be added to broaden the discontinuity so that it is at least one grid cell thick . because viscosity and heat conductivity are proportional to @xmath7 , the bgk scheme broadens shocks by enlarging @xmath7 at the location of the discontinuities .",
    "the expression for the collision time in the bgk scheme therefore contains two terms .",
    "one term is the real physical mean collision time and it is chosen according to the desired reynolds number of the problem .",
    "the second term is chosen in such a way that shocks in the flow span at least one grid cell .",
    "the latter term tunes the amount of artificial dissipation in the scheme .",
    "the notable difference between how the bgk scheme inputs artificial dissipation and how other schemes input artificial dissipation is that the bgk scheme puts it in exactly as if it were real dissipation corresponding to the numerically necessary value for @xmath7 .",
    "we emphasize that modelling the real dissipation in an astrophysical object such as that resulting from `` turbulent '' viscosity , is still outside the reach of any existing hydrocode .",
    "for one thing , values for viscosities in astrophysical objects are highly speculative .",
    "secondly , to solve navier - stokes problems with a particular value of the viscosity for an astrophysical object requires grid resolutions which are beyond what is currently achievable . for laboratory scale phenomena and for small enough reynolds number ,",
    "the bgk code is successful at modelling the dissipation produced by particle collisions in a fluid .",
    "tests of the kolmogorov and the laminar boundary layer problem show real dissipative effects ( xu & prendergast 1994 ) .",
    "thus far the bgk code has been extensively tested without the inclusion of gravity .",
    "several papers document the tests which verify its accuracy and robustness as both an euler and navier - stokes solver in 1d and 2d cartesian geometries and for two - dimensional adaptive unstructured grids .",
    "the list of one - dimensional euler tests which have been performed with the bgk scheme includes : the roe , sod , lax - harten , woodward - colella , and sjgreen tests for subsonic and supersonic expansion ( prendergast & xu 1993 ; xu 1993 ; xu , martinelli & jameson 1995 ) . the results from these one - dimensional test cases are that the bgk scheme produces shock fronts which are typically one to two cells wide , and contact discontinuities which are slightly broader .",
    "this is competitive with high resolution codes which do not employ regridding in the neighborhood of a shock front .",
    "the bgk scheme also exhibits negligible under and over shooting even at strong shock fronts .",
    "the other notable features in the tests with rarefaction waves are the sharp corners at the junctions between the rarefaction waves and the undisturbed , uniform regions .",
    "many codes have trouble treating a low density region with a flow gradient .",
    "the bgk scheme successfully handles low density regions because it satisfies both an entropy condition and a positivity condition ( xu et al .",
    "1996 ) . in the bgk scheme collisions",
    "relax the gas toward local thermodynamic equilibrium states and this relaxation process is accompanied by an increase in entropy .",
    "godunov - type schemes on the other hand typically demand an entropy fix when they encounter strong rarefaction waves ( cf . the sjgreen test ) otherwise they produce unphysical rarefaction shocks .",
    "usually the fix is an addition of artificial viscosity .",
    "because the bgk scheme naturally satisfies the entropy condition , it simply can not generate these unphysical phenomena . in satisfying the positivity condition",
    ", the bgk scheme avoids producing states with negative density or internal energy .",
    "the roe test is conducive to the creation of these non - physical states but the bgk scheme does not encounter them ( prendergast & xu 1993 ) .",
    "the same can not be said of the performance of conservative finite difference schemes and codes employing riemann solvers ( e.g. roe s approximate riemann solver ) .",
    "the list of two - dimensional euler test cases which have been performed with the bgk scheme includes : ( a ) uniform mach 3 flow in a tunnel with a forward facing step ( the emery test ) .",
    "the bgk code is not modified in any way near the step to treat the flow past it and its corner , which is a singular point . with the bgk",
    "scheme expansion shocks never emerge from the corner ( prendergast & xu 1993 ; xu 1993 ; xu et al .",
    "1995 ) , ( b ) double mach reflection in supersonic flow over a wedge , ( c ) the diffraction of a strong shock ( @xmath8 ) around a corner . test cases ( b ) and ( c ) are further examples of the bgk scheme succeeding at simulating flow without having to summon any detection algorithms or entropy fixes . according to xu et al .",
    "1995 , the original godunov scheme , the roe scheme without the entropy fix , and the osher scheme could produce a rarefaction shock at the corner in test case ( c ) ; ( d ) flow around an impulsively started cylinder . when applied to this problem , many schemes either fail or have severe problems in maintaining positive pressure and density in the near vacuum low pressure and low density region created behind the cylinder .",
    "the bgk scheme seems to be able to preserve positivity without _ ad hoc _ fixes , and to reach a steady state solution for the problem ( xu et al .",
    "1996 ) .    to test its performance as a navier - stokes solver and to see",
    "if it has real viscosity effects , the bgk scheme has been applied to the laminar boundary layer problem and the kolmogorov problem ( xu 1993 ) .",
    "the laminar boundary layer problem models the flow of gas above a flat plate .",
    "even on coarse grids ( e.g. ( 32 x 16 ) , ( 16 x 8) ) , the bgk scheme impressively recovers the blasius profile . in the kolmogorov problem , a one - dimensional sinusoidal velocity field",
    "is imposed in a uniform density and isothermal fluid .",
    "the bgk code fulfills the navier - stokes prediction which is that the shape of the fluid s velocity profile remains unchanged while the amplitude of the velocity decreases in such a way that the fluid s kinetic energy decays exponentially .",
    "the agreement between the theoretical viscosity coefficient and the numerical viscosity coefficient ( deduced from the measured decay rate ) is excellent .    to improve the resolution of physical discontinuities occurring in complicated flows , a version of the bgk scheme on a two - dimensional adaptive unstructured grid",
    "has now been developed ( kim & jameson 1998 ) .",
    "most astronomical applications of a hydrocode require a consideration of gravity .",
    "to this end we have been developing the bgk scheme .",
    "recently the bgk scheme has been used for a cosmological simulation ( xu 1997 ) but this is prior to results showing the long - term stability of the bgk scheme with gravity and the bgk scheme s convergence to the equilibrium state with gravity . in this paper",
    "we give such results .",
    "in addition to the incorporation of gravity , we have modified the geometry of the eulerian grid to axisymmetric cylindrical coordinates .",
    "changing the geometry of the grid has effects similar to the effects of adding gravity to the bgk scheme .",
    "it gives rise to source terms in the hydrodynamic equations .",
    "for the purpose of simplicity , in this paper we describe modifications to the bgk method when a time - independent gravitational potential is incorporated into a bgk scheme in cartesian coordinates ( section  [ sec - fsg ] ) .",
    "we present results however for both gas flow on a one - dimensional cartesian grid and on an axisymmetric cylindrical grid ( section  [ sec - results ] ) .",
    "in cartesian coordinates , we specify the position and velocity of a particle with coordinates @xmath9 . to be clear , @xmath10 here is a 3-vector @xmath11 giving the position of a particle in configuration space and @xmath12 is a 3-vector @xmath13 giving the velocity of a particle in this space . in this coordinate system and in the presence of a smooth gravitational field with gravitational potential , @xmath14 ,",
    "the bgk equation is : @xmath15 ( for reference , this is equivalent to equation 2.15 in shu ( 1992 ) where @xmath16 is the bgk collision term @xmath17 . )",
    "recall that in the bgk collision term @xmath6 is the equilibrium distribution towards which the true velocity distribution function @xmath1 relaxes on a collision timescale , @xmath7 .",
    "we define the units of @xmath1 and @xmath6 to be the mass in a volume element of phase space .",
    "the particle collision time @xmath7 depends on macroscopic quantities such as temperature and density , and it is therefore a function of position @xmath10 and time @xmath18 . both @xmath1 and @xmath6 are functions of space @xmath10 , time @xmath18 , and particle velocities @xmath12 and @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a @xmath21-dimensional vector of velocities associated with the internal degrees of freedom of a particle . with this parameterization of the internal velocities ,",
    "the energy associated with internal degrees of freedom is written as @xmath22 where @xmath23 .",
    "included in these internal degrees of freedom is the energy not explicitly accounted for in versions of the code with physical spatial dimension , d , less than three .",
    "for example a particle in a diatomic gas @xmath24 moving in 3 spatial dimensions has 5 degrees of freedom .",
    "( the connection between the number of degrees of freedom , @xmath25 , and the ratio of specific heats , @xmath26 , is @xmath27 . ) because a one dimensional hydrocode @xmath28 treats only one of these degrees of freedom explicitly , the behavior of the diatomic gas is reproduced by treating the four remaining degrees of freedom as internal energies .",
    "we represent those energies in the k - dimensional vector @xmath19 where @xmath29 . in terms of @xmath26 , @xmath30 .",
    "equations governing the time evolution of the mass density , momentum density and kinetic plus internal energy density are found by multiplying ( [ eq : cylbgk ] ) in turn by 1 , @xmath12 , and @xmath31 and integrating over a volume in velocity space , @xmath32 .",
    "the volume element in velocity space has the above form in the @xmath19 variable because we need only the total internal energy of a particle and not the energy associated with any particular internal degree of freedom .",
    "hence an integration has been performed over angles in @xmath19 .",
    "an essential point about the derivation of the hydrodynamic equations from velocity moments of the bgk equation is that moments of the bgk collision term , @xmath33 , vanish .",
    "this is enforced by the fundamental hypothesis of the bgk model : in the relaxation process collisions tend to reshuffle the particles defining the true distribution function , @xmath34 into a local equilibrium distribution , @xmath35 having the same mass , momentum and energy densities as @xmath36 .",
    "we call this requirement for the equivalence of @xmath1 and @xmath6 s moments , the `` compatability condition '' .    for detailed results of taking velocity moments of ( [ eq : cylbgk ] )",
    ", we refer once again to shu 1992 ( p.20 - 23 ) .",
    "we give the moment equations here in compact form : @xmath37 where we have defined the following bracket notation : @xmath38 and @xmath39 . in eq .",
    "[ eq : bracketmom ] we see that mass , momentum and energy densities are updated by terms which are the divergence of a quantity ( i.e. this quantity is commonly referred to as a flux ) and when gravity ( or a curved coordinate system ) is involved , also by terms which can not generally be written as the divergence of a quantity and hence can not update the contents of a cell by a flux through the cell s surface .",
    "the latter terms are called source terms . without gravity and in cartesian",
    "coordinates , a bgk scheme for hydrodynamics evolves all the hydrodynamic quantities exclusively by flux terms .",
    "we emphasize that there is no dissipation source term in equation  [ eq : bracketmom ] .",
    "dissipative terms are carried by the fluxes .",
    "the bgk scheme is unique in this respect . in cartesian coordinates it allows a fluid to evolve concurrently through advective and dissipative processes without decoupling them into two separate operations .    with gravity ,",
    "source term computation is unavoidable .",
    "the gravitational source term in the momentum equation can not be manipulated into the form of the divergence of some quantity , so it persists as a source term . the gravitational source term in the energy equation on the other hand",
    "may be reformulated to give an energy equation without a source term if the gravitational field is independent of time . in this paper",
    "we consider this case . without a gravitational source term , the energy equation for the case of a time - independent gravitational field is a conservative equation for the total kinetic , internal and gravitational energies . in one dimension",
    "it is : @xmath40 we define @xmath41 here as the flux of the kinetic plus internal energy , and @xmath42 as the mass flux . in @xmath41 and @xmath42",
    "we are only considering the @xmath43-component of the flux , i.e. the flux through a wall perpendicular to the @xmath43 direction .    in the end ,",
    "the bgk scheme follows the time evolution of the integrated values of mass , momentum and energy densities within cells . for example , for one dimensional flow in cartesian",
    "coordinates the bgk scheme tracks the contents of a volume element with boundaries @xmath44 and @xmath45 . if the values of mass , momentum and energy densities ( denoted below by @xmath46 ) are given within this cell at time @xmath47 then at time @xmath48 the new values of the mass , momentum and energies are updated by fluxes ( @xmath49 ) ( section  [ sec - hydfluxesg ] ) through the cell s boundaries and in some cases by source terms ( @xmath50 ) ( section  [ sec - src ] ) .",
    "@xmath51      fluxes in the bgk scheme arise from velocity moments of a particle distribution function @xmath1 which is a solution to the ordinary differential equation @xmath52 with initial conditions @xmath53 at @xmath54 .",
    "this equation holds along each trajectory .",
    "the solution is composed of two terms : an integral over the past history of @xmath6 and a term representing relaxation from an initial state , @xmath55 .",
    "@xmath56 here @xmath57 and @xmath58 in the arguments of @xmath6 are solutions of a gas particle s equations of motion in cartesian coordinates with gravity : @xmath59 with the final conditions @xmath60 and @xmath61 at @xmath62 . to first order in time",
    "the solutions of these equations are : @xmath63 these equations define a single trajectory for the particles which arrive at @xmath64 at time @xmath18 with velocity @xmath12",
    ". the trajectory would generally be curved if we carried terms of higher order than those shown .",
    "even when we are formulating the bgk scheme for a 1-dimensional cartesian grid there is no escape from considering @xmath65 a vector in three dimensions . both @xmath1 and @xmath6",
    "always depend on all of the `` molecular '' velocity components because individual particles can have velocities of any speed and in any direction .",
    "a consequence of this is that when fluxes are eventually computed at @xmath64 , @xmath66 is integrated over the full and continuous range of velocities , @xmath12 , from @xmath67 to @xmath68",
    ". therefore fluxes computed from the true distribution function @xmath69 arise by a weighted integration of the equilibrium distribution function @xmath70 not just over one trajectory but over all possible trajectories ( in 6-dimensional phase space ) which arrive at ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "( we leave it to section  [ sec - implication ] for a discussion of the implications of this . ) for a 1-dimensional problem in cartesian coordinates all we require is that the trajectory wind up on the wall located at @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are fixed for all @xmath43 because the only non - trivial dimension is the @xmath43-dimension .",
    "now as already stated in the introduction , @xmath6 is not known _ a priori _ along all the trajectories passing through @xmath64 at time t. physically @xmath6 must describe an equilibrium state so it is sensible to assume a maxwellian form for @xmath6 : @xmath75 here @xmath76 are the mean macroscopic velocities in the @xmath43 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 directions respectively . to explain why @xmath79 has this physical interpretation we go to the one - dimensional problem . in one - dimension ,",
    "@xmath80 and @xmath81 are zero so @xmath6 is effectively left with 3 parameters : @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 . for a perfect gas with @xmath85",
    "the `` compatability '' condition gives an explicit relationship in closed form between the mass , momentum and energy densities and @xmath6 s parameters : @xmath86 ( note that when @xmath6 is maxwellian its velocity moments follow simple recurrence relations ( see appendix in xu et al .",
    "( 1996 ) ) . )",
    "[ eq : parcorr ] assigns physical meaning to @xmath6 s parameters : @xmath82 is the mass density , @xmath83 is the mean macroscopic velocity in the @xmath87 direction , and @xmath84 is related to the mass density , @xmath82 , and the internal energy density , @xmath88 , in the following way : @xmath89 where @xmath21 was defined earlier as the dimension of the vector @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath84 is therefore inversely proportional to the temperature of the gas .",
    "of course mass densities , mean macroscopic velocities and internal energy densities change with space and time in the fluid and their evolution is assumed to be governed by the evolving distribution function @xmath1 .",
    "hence there is a mutual connection between @xmath1 and @xmath6 . by substituting the formal solution for @xmath1 ( eq . [ eq : formalbgksoltn ] ) which itself depends on @xmath6 into the `` compatability condition '' on the moments of @xmath6 , one arrives at a set of coupled non - linear integral equations for the space and time dependence of @xmath6 s parameters : @xmath90 here we have adopted the following abbreviated notation for @xmath6 and its parameters .",
    "let @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 we define the transpose of @xmath94 to be @xmath95 and @xmath96 to be a vector of @xmath6 s parameters : @xmath97,-2\\lambda u,-2\\lambda v ,   -2\\lambda w , 2\\lambda).\\ ] ] notice that @xmath94 has no space dependence whereas @xmath96 has no velocity dependence .",
    "in equation ( [ eq : coupinteqs ] ) we assume that the collision time , @xmath7 , which is a function of macroscopic densities is locally constant and hence can be removed outside the integral which is performed over the velocity moments .",
    "the computation of @xmath7 is discussed in section  [ sec - collisiontime ] . because @xmath55 in the formal solution for @xmath1 ( eq.[eq : formalbgksoltn ] ) may be straighforwardly constructed from the initial conditions , and because the integral over @xmath98 in the formal solution for @xmath1 is readily evaluated",
    "once @xmath98 is known , the bulk of the numerical work in the bgk scheme lies in solving the above coupled non - linear integral equations for @xmath98 .      following the sketch of what is required for a computation of @xmath1 , we outline some aspects of the numerical procedure , particularly those which are relevant to adding gravity to the scheme .",
    "the details of the flux computation for the 2d cartesian case without gravity are presented in xu & prendergast ( 1994 ) , xu et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , kim & jameson ( 1998 ) . in cartesian coordinates we divide the computational domain into cells .",
    "we then suppose that we are given the values of mass , momentum and energy densities within each cell at the beginning of a timestep , @xmath99 .",
    "we describe the procedure for computing @xmath1 at a point @xmath64 on a cell boundary .",
    "we begin the numerical computation of the true distribution function @xmath69 at @xmath64 by the construction of @xmath100 which appears in the integrand of ( [ eq : formalbgksoltn ] ) .",
    "because we only need to know @xmath1 at position @xmath64 located on a cell interface and for the duration of a cfl timestep we do not compute @xmath70 precisely at each point along all the trajectories crossing @xmath64 at @xmath18 .",
    "instead we compute @xmath6 at the point @xmath64 on the cell interface at time @xmath99 ( where @xmath99 corresponds to the beginning of a time step ) and then approximate it in the spatial and temporal vicinity of ( @xmath101 ) through a taylor expansion .",
    "@xmath102 to show the velocity dependence in the spatial and time derivatives of @xmath6 we rewrite the taylor series expansion as : @xmath103 here the vectors @xmath104 and @xmath105 depend on the derivatives of the parameters of @xmath6 with respect to space and time and on @xmath65 and @xmath106 as well .",
    "the spatial and time derivatives of @xmath6 are assumed to be locally constant and we group them as coefficients of particle velocities , @xmath107 in the following way : @xmath108 the subscripts @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , and @xmath113 refer to the five parameters in @xmath6 ( cf .",
    "eq .  [ eq : coupinteqs ] )",
    ". recall that @xmath57 and @xmath58 lie on curved trajectories ( eq . [ eq : soltnseoms ] ) if the trajectory is sufficiently prolonged .",
    "however if we substitute the expressions for @xmath114 given in ( [ eq : soltnseoms ] ) into the expansion for @xmath115 ( eq.[eq : maxtaylor ] ) ( with the expressions for @xmath104 and @xmath105 given in ( [ eq : velexp ] ) ) and if we retain only terms linear in time , the curvature terms in the particle trajectories do not contribute to the expansion . hence to first order in time , the solution of the bgk equation for the true distribution function @xmath69 in one - dimensional cartesian coordinates with gravity is equivalent to the solution for the one dimensional bgk equation in cartesian coordinates and without gravity .",
    "this result generalizes to the case of non - cartesian geometries .",
    "it is the first important result concerning the incorporation of gravity into the bgk scheme .",
    "+ our strategy for solving for the terms in the taylor expansion of @xmath6 is : ( a ) solve for @xmath116 and the first spatial derivatives of @xmath6 from initial conditions .",
    "this is possible because as we already showed in section  [ sec - hydfluxesg ] there is a direct connection between @xmath6 s parameters and the mass , momentum and energy densities which are specified within each cell at the beginning of a timestep @xmath99 .",
    "we can easily obtain the values of the macroscopic densities and their first spatial derivatives with respect to @xmath117 at @xmath118 through interpolation and thereby solve for @xmath6 and @xmath6 s first spatial derivatives at the cell boundary , @xmath64 .",
    "we refer to prendergast & xu ( 1993 ) for the details of the numerical interpolation including a discussion of interpolation switches .",
    "the latter are devices to prevent spurious maxima and other artefacts , and are commonly used in the reconstruction phase in many schemes .",
    "( b ) before solving for the time derivatives of @xmath6 , we construct the initial distribution function , @xmath55 . because the distribution function @xmath55 should reflect a possible non - equilibrium initial state across the cell interface located at position @xmath64 , we assume @xmath55 to be composed of two half maxwellians .",
    "it is easiest to see what we mean by this by again considering a one - dimensional cartesian problem .",
    "if we divide the computational domain into intervals whose boundaries are specified by @xmath44,@xmath45 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 and we look at flux transfers in the @xmath43-direction through one of these boundaries located at @xmath121 then we may construct @xmath55 at @xmath121 by constructing one half - maxwellian to the left of @xmath121 and another half - maxwellian to the right of @xmath121 .",
    "the parameters of the two half maxwellians as well as their slopes are obtained from the initial conditions , just as @xmath6 s parameters were obtained but the left ( right ) maxwellian is computed from the mass , momentum and energy densities interpolated from the left ( right ) side of the cell interface .",
    "this choice for the form of @xmath55 is not unique .",
    "the details of @xmath55 should not matter , since they are rapidly damped for small @xmath7 .",
    "( c ) finally we solve for the time derivatives of @xmath6 by insisting that the `` compatability condition '' is satisfied on average over the cfl time interval . due to our approximate computation of @xmath6 and hence of @xmath1 , @xmath6 and @xmath1 can not have exactly the same moments for the duration of a cfl time step over all the trajectories arriving at @xmath64 .",
    "however we insist that they have the same moments at @xmath64 and on average over the time interval @xmath122 for which the true distribution function is computed .",
    "@xmath123 this condition gives an expression for @xmath105 ( see xu & prendergast ( 1994 ) ) .",
    "it is worth remarking that the manner in which the time derivatives of @xmath6 are computed is in some sense implicit .",
    "because eq .  [ eq : ahats ] is applied over the entire time interval , expressions for @xmath105 arise from information throughout the entire time interval as opposed to just information at the beginning of a time step .",
    "we also point out that by finding the time - dependence of @xmath1 through the formal solution for @xmath1 plus the `` compatability condition '' applied on average over an updating time step , prendergast and xu s ( 1993 ) bgk scheme bypasses the stiffness in the bgk equation which would force the updating timestep to be the particle collision timescale @xmath7 . because the updating time step is determined from the clf condition hydrodynamics may be performed with the bgk scheme .",
    "earlier attempts at implementing the bgk equation ( e.g. chu 1965 ) were constrained by the stiffness of the bgk equation and their application was therefore limited to rarefied gas dynamics .      aside from the courant factor in the computation of the cfl time step ( section  [ sec - courant ] ) ( and certain constants which depend on the adopted interpolation rules ) , the expression for the collision time , @xmath7 , contains the only 2 parameters in the code . according to gas kinetic theory , the mean time between collisions in a gas with density @xmath82 and temperature @xmath124 is proportional to @xmath125 . since @xmath126 , @xmath127 where @xmath128 is a proportionality constant and the first of the two parameters in @xmath7 .",
    "we add a second term to the expression for the collision time .",
    "in one - dimensional cartesian coordinates this second term is : @xmath129 the subscript @xmath130 denotes quantities interpolated from the left ( right ) side of the cell interface at which we compute the collision time @xmath7 and @xmath131 is the gas pressure .",
    "we choose the above form for the second term in the expression for the collision time @xmath7 because it helps with shocks across which there are gradients in @xmath131 .",
    "as stated in the introduction ( section  [ sec - intro ] ) , we motivate this second term in the collision time as follows : given that the coefficients of heat conduction and viscosity are proportional to the collision time @xmath7 , the second term in the expression for @xmath7 acts to increase both heat conduction and viscosity at shock fronts but not at contact discontinuities across which pressure is continuous . when the second term in the collision time dominates , the order of the scheme is reduced and the true distribution function @xmath1 is determined more by the initial distribution function @xmath55 than by the integral over @xmath6 .",
    "once @xmath132 is fully known as a function of the parameters of @xmath6 , @xmath55 , the collision time @xmath7 , and @xmath18 , the time - dependent fluxes at @xmath64 can be computed .",
    "we illustrate flux computation for a one - dimensional cartesian problem . in that case",
    "we are interested only in the @xmath43-component of the total flux , i.e. the component of the flux which is perpendicular to a cell wall at @xmath121 . the total amount of mass",
    ", @xmath43-momentum and energy densities transferred through the wall perpendicular to the @xmath43-direction in a cfl time step @xmath133 is found from : @xmath134 note that in the end , the gas kinetic origin of the expressions for the fluxes disappears and they are written as highly non - linear functions of the mass , momenta and energy densities which are presumed known at the beginning of the time step .      the time step @xmath135 used to evolve the dynamical equations is chosen so that it satisfies the cfl condition .",
    "physically the cfl condition limits the distance that information can travel in one time step to one cell . for the one - dimensional cartesian case we compute @xmath135 for each cell on the grid from @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the local gravitational acceleration due to gravity ,",
    "i.e. @xmath138 , @xmath139 is the local macroscopic velocity , @xmath140 is the local adiabatic sound speed and @xmath141 this choice for @xmath142 insures that flux transport between adjacent cells is carried out for a length of time short enough so as not to empty them .",
    "finally the time step @xmath124 is chosen from @xmath143 where @xmath144 is a safety factor ; it is called the cfl factor ( typically @xmath145 ) .      unlike riemann solvers which propagate information along the characteristics of the euler equations , the bgk scheme propagates information along the characteristics of the boltzmann equation",
    ". these are particle trajectories in phase space . in the bgk scheme fluid properties along the full continuum of trajectories passing through @xmath146",
    "contribute to the instantaneous fluxes at @xmath146 .",
    "the implications of this are many .",
    "firstly it bypasses the limitation of lattice boltzmann codes which discretize velocity space thereby restricting the number of directions for the propagation of information and thereby also limiting the magnitudes of the gas velocities .",
    "secondly , using all the trajectories with appropriate weighting endows the bgk scheme with intrinsic upwindedness .",
    "an upwind scheme computes fluxes using information coming from the same direction as the flow .",
    "when computing fluxes , the bgk scheme does not select trajectories corresponding to the direction of flow and discount the rest ; instead it uses information carried by all trajectories arriving at the place where we construct @xmath1 , but it weights the information along each trajectory according to the number of particles assigned to the trajectory by the bgk solution .",
    "this is what we mean by an intrinsically upwind scheme .",
    "thirdly , the consideration of the full continuum of trajectories for the flux computation creates the potential for a truly multidimensional code . because the velocity integration includes all propagation directions and because the trajectories can be followed multidimensionally , the flux in one direction can potentially be computed from information coming with all speeds and all directions . for a genuinely multidimensional scheme",
    ", the interpolation of the initial conditions for the reconstruction stage must also be multidimensional .",
    "for example , for a computation on a two dimensional cartesian grid , the reconstruction of the initial conditions at a point @xmath147 should include information from cells surrounding the point in both the @xmath43 and the @xmath77 directions .    at the present time",
    ", the multidimensional bgk schemes which have been implemented do not take advantage of the truly multidimensional possibility that the bgk scheme offers .",
    "they still simplify flux updates by separating them into individual operations in independent directions .",
    "this is an example of `` operator - splitting '' . on the optimistic side ,",
    "a truly multidimensional bgk scheme is conceivable .",
    "the same can not be said for schemes based on riemann solvers . even in two dimensions",
    "it is not feasible to construct a truly multidimensional riemann solver . upon representing the initial conditions as piecewise constant in two - dimensional cells , the riemann solution is straightforward to apply at each of the interfaces of a two - dimensional cell but problematic at cell corners .",
    "furthermore , by propagating information only along the directions normal to cell interfaces , a two - dimensional riemann solver has the same limitation as an operator - split method : it does not accommodate the possibility that waves in two - dimensional flows may propagate in infinitely many directions ( roe 1986 ) .      because to first order in time the computation of the true distribution function , @xmath148 , and hence the computation of the hydrodynamical fluxes is unaffected by gravity , gravity s influence on the gas flow is relegated to source terms .",
    "in one - dimensional cartesian coordinates gravitational source terms contribute to the momentum change in a cell over a cfl time step @xmath149 to @xmath150 in the following form : @xmath151 this integral may be computed in a number of ways .",
    "one possible approach is to do a linear interpolation in @xmath152 using the values of the mass densities and forces at the cell wells surrounding the cell for which we wish to compute the source term .",
    "the time integration required by ( [ eq : momsrcterm ] ) takes advantage of the fact that we know the new mass densities at the end of an updating time step , i.e. at @xmath150 , before we ve completed the updates of the other fluid quantities , i.e. @xmath153 , @xmath154 .",
    "this is a consequence of there being no source terms in the mass continuity equation . from the mass densities at times @xmath149 and @xmath150 we may perform a bilinear interpolation in @xmath43 and @xmath18 for the integral in equation ( [ eq : momsrcterm ] ) . specifically @xmath155 where @xmath156      as for gravity s contribution to the energy equation , we explore two versions of it .",
    "one form of the energy equation : @xmath157 has a gravitational energy source term , @xmath158 . the gravitational energy source term may be computed analogously to the way in which the gravitational momentum source terms are computed ( cf .",
    "[ eq : gmomsrc ] ) .",
    "as mentioned in section  [ sec - hydeq ] , another form of the energy equation incorporates the gravitational energy source term into the energy fluxes and hence is in conservative form : @xmath159 the conservative form of the energy equation requires a good computation of the gravitational energy because now it , in addition to the kinetic energy , @xmath160 , must be subtracted from the total energy for the purpose of obtaining the internal energy , @xmath161 .",
    "these subtractions are potentially extremely delicate .",
    "they are important because the internal energy is used in computing @xmath84 ( which is inversely proportional to the temperature ) , a crucial parameter for the hydrodynamic fluxes .",
    "because the form of the gravitational energy is similar to the form of the gravitational source terms , @xmath162 it may be numerically computed in the same manner , i.e. by a linear interpolation to the values of the densities and the potentials at the walls bounding a cell .    for the gravitational flux term , @xmath163 , in the conservative energy equation we use the value of the gravitational potential @xmath164 at the same point @xmath121",
    "at which we construct the true distribution function , @xmath1 , for the other fluxes .",
    "we have given a description of the procedure for computing hydrodynamical fluxes and source terms in a bgk scheme designed for hydrodynamics in the presence of a time - independent gravitational field .",
    "1.)while incorporating gravity into the bgk scheme we have found that to first order in time gravity does not alter the computation of the distribution function from which hydrodynamical fluxes are computed .",
    "it enters into the hydrodynamical computation through gravitational momentum source terms as well as through either a gravitational energy source term or through gravitational energy fluxes .",
    "the latter depends on the chosen form of the energy equation .",
    "2.)the energy source term formulation by definition does not guarantee conservation of total ( kinetic + internal + gravitational ) energy .",
    "an inaccurate computation of the energy source term introduces numerical heating and/or cooling . because the energy equation can be manipulated into a conservative form for the total kinetic + internal + gravitational energy , computation of an energy source term is avoidable . in lieu of an energy source term",
    ", the gravitational energy enters into the hydrodynamical computation through flux terms .",
    "these flux terms do not require any flux computation in addition to the computation which is already required in a hydrodynamics scheme without gravity .",
    "this is because they are conveniently the product of the gravitational potential and the mass flux terms .",
    "3.)even though an implementation of the conservative form of the energy equation by definition assures total energy conservation , it introduces another challenge brought on by the inclusion of gravity into a hydrocode . for the calculation of hydrodynamical fluxes in the bgk scheme",
    "it is essential to accurately compute the temperature and therefore the internal energy . with gravity and with an implementation of the conservative form of the energy equation",
    "it therefore becomes necessary to accurately compute the gravitational energy so that it , in addition to the kinetic energy , may be subtracted from the total energy ( kinetic + internal + gravitational ) to give the internal energy without introducing numerical heating ( or cooling ) into the scheme .",
    "we present results from two tests of the bgk scheme in the presence of a time - independent gravitational potential .",
    "the first test reveals the effect on a simulation of using different forms of the energy equation .",
    "the second test is performed on an axisymmetric cylindrical grid .",
    "both tests reveal the capability of the bgk scheme with gravity to reach an equilibrium state and to maintain a gas configuration in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "we perform this test case to compare the results from two versions of the bgk scheme with gravity : one using the conservative form of the energy equation ( the ecs scheme ) and one using the energy source term formulation of the energy equation ( the est scheme ) .",

    "lambda at the beginning of the simulations is @xmath189 .    in the results from the scheme using the non - conservative form of the energy equation",
    ", there is a monotonic decline in lambda ( fig .",

    "this is because the strong gravitational forces ( fig .",

    "therefore at @xmath234 iterations ( time @xmath237 ) the time is @xmath238 in units of the initial free - fall time .    the most significant thing to notice in the results from this computation",
    "are the sharp shock fronts .",
    "even though the computation was performed on a relatively coarse grid ( @xmath209 cells in @xmath210 and @xmath211 cells in @xmath78 ) , only about two cells are needed to resolve a shock and there is no evidence of under and overshooting .",

    "the circles are the values of @xmath84 in each cell and the thin lines are curves through these values .",
    "it is easy to see that only about two cells are needed to resolve a shock .",
    "the most notable results of the preceeding test runs may be summarized as follows : 1.)for a fixed , external gravitational field both in cartesian geometry and in axisymmetric cylindrical geometry with a conservative form for the energy equation , the bgk scheme is able to keep a configuration in hydrostatic equilibrium for many sound crossing times . furthermore with the energy equation in conservative form the bgk scheme settles to the correct physical solution .",
    "2.)the bgk scheme is able to achieve high resolution with rather coarse grids .",
    "for example the simulation of gas falling into a fixed external spherically symmetric gravitational potential uses @xmath209 cells in @xmath210 and @xmath211 cells in @xmath78 and achieves shocks whose fronts span only @xmath109 or @xmath110 cells .",
    "we never resort to regridding in the neighborhood of a discontinuity to achieve high resolution .",
    "conventional hydrocodes frequently strive for high resolution through grid refinement techniques .",
    "this approach is both expensive and ineffective beyond a certain point .",
    "uniform grid refinement shortens time steps : in @xmath111 dimensions , a decrease by a factor of @xmath110 in the grid spacing of each of the @xmath111 dimensions involves a factor of @xmath242 increase in the number of cycles that the code has to execute to reach the same total time .",
    "furthermore even if one is willing to accept the expense of short timesteps , no matter how fine the grid , a diffusive scheme never achieves the accuracy of a high resolution scheme run on the same sized grid . with",
    "that said , local adaptive grid refinement for the bgk scheme ( without gravity ) has been implemented by kim & jameson ( 1998 ) and it gives excellent results for a number of tests involving unsteady supersonic flows .",
    "we incorporated gravity into the bgk scheme for hydrodynamics and presented results for the case of time - independent gravitational potentials both on a one - dimensional cartesian grid and on an axisymmetric cylindrical grid .",
    "our results show that the bgk scheme is generalizable to the case of a gas moving in the presence of an external , time - independent gravitational field .",
    "when we derive an approximate local solution to the bgk equation , linear in space and time , gravity s curvature of particle trajectories is unimportant .",
    "effect on the flow enters into the computational method only through gravitational source terms .",
    "we conclude by stating that we believe that no other hydrodynamical scheme which is used in astrophysical computational fluid dynamics invokes as few `` fixes '' and operates with as much generality as the bgk scheme .",
    "there are no discontinuity detection algorithms , with subsequent special treatment of special regions .",
    "an entropy fix never has to be invoked when following the evolution of rarefaction waves because the bgk scheme satisfies the `` entropy condition '' .",
    "truly multi - dimensional bgk schemes ( i.e. non - operator split ) are realizable .",
    "we attribute the bgk scheme s performance to its derivation from a model to the collisional boltzmann equation .",
    "a tremendous advantage of a hydrocode designed on the basis of a solution to a model of such a fundamental equation is that the scheme gets physical backing for its incorporation of viscous and heat conductive effects .",
    "velocity moments of a time - dependent local solution to the bgk equation give hydrodynamical fluxes which carry both advective and dissipative terms - the bgk scheme does not decouple them into separate operations . furthermore the algorithm for solving the bgk equation in the bgk scheme avoids the bgk equation s stiffness which would cause the time step of the scheme to be the collision time of the gas instead of the much larger cfl time . without such an algorithm to bypass the bgk equation s stiffness , the timestep would be prohibitively small for performing hydrodynamical simulations in real time .    while it may seem complicated to solve for fluid evolution by following a changing distribution function ( including the effects of collisions ) in phase space , we believe that it is not . in spite of its looks ,",
    "the bgk scheme is a computationally straightforward explicit scheme , and all parts of the algebra are in explicit closed form for a perfect gas .",
    "even when a matrix is inverted for the connection between the moments and parameters of a maxwellian , the inverse is explicitly known .",
    "unless readers were told they might not guess from inspection of the code that it originated in gas - dynamic considerations .",
    "the code itself is just straightforward algebra .",
    "there are no iterative steps in the bgk scheme .",
    "there is no riemann solver , either exact or approximate .",
    "no numerical sub - steps ( e.g. runge - kutta steps ) are used .",
    "thus far we have not been concerned with the optimization of the code .",
    "code development has focused on demonstrating that the code correctly simulates physical phenomena .",
    "kim and jameson ( 1998 ) compared the cpu time required just for the bgk scheme s flux computation to the flux computation in two other high resolution schemes which use flux - splitting methods : characteristic splitting using roe averaging ( csplit ) ( jameson 1996 ) and cusp(convective upwind split pressure ) splitting by jameson ( kim and jameson 1995 ) .",
    "they find that the bgk scheme is less than twice as slow as the two other schemes .",
    "note that in contrast to the flux computation in the other schemes , the bgk flux computation includes extra arithmetical operations for navier - stokes terms .",
