    "diffractive phenomena in hadron physics are related to strong interaction .",
    "qcd is recognized as the fundamental theory of strong interaction .",
    "thus , description of diffractive reactions at high energies should be grounded on some qcd - based techniques .",
    "but the special status of diffractive studies at high - energy colliders is determined by the fact that diffraction of hadrons takes place due to interaction at large distances .",
    "indeed , the transverse size of the hadron interaction region can be estimated through the corresponding heisenberg uncertainty relation , and extraction of this quantity from experimental elastic angular distributions can be done without dealing with any theory .",
    "for example , at the sps , tevatron , and lhc energies it is of order 1 fm . technically , this means that we are in the so - called `` non - perturbative regime '' and straight applying qcd to description of hadronic diffraction is disabled , since qcd , at its current stage of development , has no essential progress outside of perturbative calculations .    hence , one is enforced to invent `` plausible '' models which bear , at least , general qcd properties , as much as possible .",
    "in the vast majority of diffraction models the notion of reggeons ( analytic continuations of resonance spectra ) is used .    below",
    ", the recipe for calculation of the elastic scattering amplitude in the framework of the regge - eikonal approach @xcite is presented : @xmath0    @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath3 here @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the mandelstam variables , @xmath6 is the impact parameter , @xmath7 is the elastic scattering amplitude , eikonal @xmath8 is the sum of single - reggeon - exchange terms , @xmath9 are regge trajectories , and @xmath10 are the reggeonic form - factors of colliding particles .",
    "besides the regge - eikonal approximation , there exist various approaches exploiting the notion of reggeons .",
    "calculation of regge trajectories within qcd is one of the main theoretical problems of hadron physics .",
    "what are fundamental achievements in this direction ?",
    "the first approach yielding some results on qcd regge trajectories is the famous bfkl approach based on solving the so - called bfkl equation @xcite which is some modification of the bethe - salpeter equation . within this approach ,",
    "the behavior of the regge trajectories of the reggeons composed of two reggeized partons was calculated at asymptotically high transfers ( in the case of quark - antiquark pair by kwiecinski @xcite and for two gluons by kirschner and lipatov @xcite ) : @xmath11 @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the qcd running coupling .",
    "as well , the intercept of the leading regge trajectory , pomeron , was calculated by fadin and lipatov and , also , ciafaloni and camici @xcite : @xmath14 in contrast to the asymptotic relations at high transfers , the last expression is explicitly not renorm - invariant , since it depends on an arbitrary renormalization scale @xmath15 .",
    "certainly , though regge trajectories as analytic ( i.e. unique ) continuations of resonance spectra should be renorm - invariant , they could be approximated by some renorm - noninvariant expressions ( like in qed ) , but the proper choice of the renormalization scheme and scale should be physically motivated .",
    "also , the theoretical uncertainty ( determined by the neglected terms ) should be low enough for a possibility of practical use of the obtained renorm - noninvariant approximations under calculation of scattering amplitudes . at the current stage of the bfkl approach development , the theoretical uncertainty of the bfkl pomeron intercept value is rather high , and , thus",
    ", the bfkl method provides information only about the asymptotic behavior of qcd regge trajectories at ultra - high values of transferred momentum .",
    "the second approach is the less - known lovelace approach @xcite which deals with the bethe - salpeter equation in some asymptotic regime , where we do not need reggeization of the partons composing the considered bound state .",
    "the main feature of this approach is exploitation of renorm - invariant kernels in the bs equation . as a result",
    ", we obtain renorm - invariant numbers for the intercepts of regge trajectories . in his paper",
    "@xcite lovelace considered asymptotically free @xmath16-theory and found some infinite series of intercepts : @xmath17 with @xmath18 .",
    "an analogous result was obtained for some series of meson regge trajectories in qcd @xcite : @xmath19 ( if @xmath20 and @xmath21 , then @xmath22 ) .",
    "note , that in the lovelace approach the intercepts of regge trajectories do not depend on the coupling at all , what is a general consequence of renorm - invariance in massless field theories @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , due to technical difficulties , the leading gluon - gluon and quark - antiquark series ( corresponding to the trajectories with the kwiecinski and kirschner - lipatov asymptotical behavior ) were not calculated , though the existence of some infinite series condensing to @xmath23 from above was proved @xcite .",
    "thus , we have got information about quantitative behavior of the qcd leading regge trajectories at very high momentum transfers only .",
    "this region of transferred momenta , however , gives a negligible contribution to diffractive cross - sections .",
    "in other words , at present moment , qcd does not provide any quantitative result which could be directly used under construction of phenomenological models of hadronic diffraction , though some models try to adopt qualitative qcd features .",
    "the phenomenological models of the nucleon - nucleon elastic diffractive scattering , proposed before the totem preliminary results had been published , could be divided into 2 groups : the models exploiting the notion of reggeons @xcite and the non - reggeon models @xcite .    in several reggeon models",
    "the eikonal representation of the scattering amplitude is used , where the eikonal is the sum of single - reggeon exchange terms with a supercritical pomeron ( or pomerons ) as the leading term @xcite .",
    "other reggeon models do not use the eikonal representation but introduce some complicated leading regge singularities : the pomeron as double regge pole in @xcite , and the so - called froissaron , the leading regge cut , in @xcite . also , these models take account of the contributions from secondary regge poles",
    ".    there exists a separate subgroup of reggeon models @xcite exploiting the methods of the reggeon field theory .",
    "the eikonal here is replaced by the so - called opacity which is the sum of not only single - reggeon - exchange terms but , also , multi - reggeon exchanges .",
    "low - mass dissociation in the intermediate states is taken into account as well .",
    "the non - reggeon phenomenological schemes could be divided into the models not appealing to qcd @xcite and the so - called qcd - inspired models @xcite .",
    "model @xcite exploits the general principles and the derivative dispersion relations as extra conditions .",
    "model @xcite is some variant of the quasi - potential approach . in @xcite nucleon",
    "is considered to have an outer cloud of quark - antiquark pairs , an inner shell of baryonic charge , and a central quark bag containing the valent quarks ( small - angle scattering is due to overlapping of the outer clouds and the exchange by @xmath24-meson ) . in the dipole cascade model",
    "@xcite nucleon is introduced as color dipole and interaction between hadrons at ultra high energies is presumed to be dominated by perturbative effects .",
    "model @xcite uses the eikonal composed of 3 terms which are called the contributions from the quark - quark , quark - gluon , and gluon - gluon interaction , though the corresponding expressions are not derived from qcd directly and contain numerous free parameters .",
    "all the mentioned models give different predictions for the nucleon - nucleon total and differential cross - sections at the lhc .",
    "comparison of the model predictions for the @xmath25 total cross - section with the value measured by the totem collaboration @xcite reveals that some of the models may be judged as discriminated already at this stage ( tab . [ totem ] ) . though others survive .",
    ".comparison of the model predictions for the @xmath25 total cross - section at @xmath26 7 tev with the totem result . [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     however , some theorists may consider deviations in several percents from experimental data to be not fatal for any model . in any case ,",
    "measurement of total cross - section only is not enough for proper discrimination among the models .",
    "some models can be discriminated via comparison with the recently published d0 data on the @xmath27 differential cross - section @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ d0imp ] ) .    in their turn",
    ", the totem data on the @xmath25 differential cross - section @xcite reveal a very strong discriminative power ( fig .",
    "[ totimp ] ) . inversely , the predictive efficiency of all of the considered models turned out very weak .",
    "i mean the fact that many models give a nice description of the nucleon - nucleon differential cross - sections from the isr to the tevatron energies @xcite ( with the collision energy increase in several tens of times ) .",
    "but though the ratio of the lhc energy to the tevatron energy is only about 4 , we can observe a huge discrepancy between the model curves and the data ( for some models  tens of percent , for others  several times ) .",
    "cm    = 7.4cm=7.4 cm -7.8 cm 8.5 cm    another question : what are the consequences of such a result for qcd ?",
    "is it falsified ?",
    "certainly , no .",
    "only the phenomenological models are the subjects of falsification but qcd is not .",
    "such a situation takes place due to the fact that all the hadron diffraction models are not grounded on analytical derivations from qcd , though some of them use adopted qcd terminology .    in 2 years",
    "after the totem preliminary results @xcite had been published we returned to the same stage as before the totem measurements : there are numerous models @xcite  @xcite ( very different by physical ground ) which describe the totem data more or less satisfactorily . but who can guarantee that such a simultaneous failure will not be reproduced after the forthcoming measurements at 14 tev ?",
    "we need a deeper interrelation of phenomenological models with qcd .",
    "first of all , we need development of some non - perturbative techniques for calculation of regge trajectories in the diffractive ( large distance ) domain of qcd .",
