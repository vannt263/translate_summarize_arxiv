    "most statistical investigations of the properties of interacting galaxies focus on the most spectacular cases and thus they are affected by strong observational biases .",
    "the samples have often been selected on basis of strongly peculiar morphologies and/or high surface brightness . in this way",
    ", systems with a highly stimulated interstellar medium and increased star formation rates have been favoured .",
    "however , some investigations ( eg . , kennicutt 1998 ; mrquez & moles 1996 ) have noted the problem and have made a special effort to deal with homogeneous samples of interacting galaxies coupled with well - matched comparison objects ( isolated undisturbed galaxies ) .",
    "these studies provide us with a more clear understanding about the connection between gravitational interactions , star formation and photometric properties in the disks of the intervening galaxies .",
    "we have initiated an observational program to study the photometrical properties of a sample of disk  disk ( s+s ) systems with a wide range of separations , morphological distortions and presumably different stages of interactions .",
    "the use of a well defined isolation criterion in the selected pairs renders our study as `` clean '' as possible in the sense that only intrinsic properties of the individual galaxies and the effects of their mutual interactions should affect the observed photometrical properties .    in figure 1 , we present the mean surface brightness and colour profiles for the galaxy pair kpg64 .",
    "this is only an example of the data we can obtain from our images .",
    "the morphologies and global photometric properties of the whole sample are being analysed for further publication ( hernndez toledo & puerari , in preparation ) .",
    "the observations discussed here are part of our broad - band bvri photometric program on binary systems which is being carried out at the two mexican optical observatories : the observatorio astronmico guillermo haro in cananea , sonora , mexico and the observatorio astronmico nacional in san pedro martir , baja california , mexico .",
