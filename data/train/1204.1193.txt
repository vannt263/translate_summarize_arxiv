    "promoting einstein s gravity to a classical theory of a massive graviton is a theoretical challenge .",
    "the appearance of a ghost instability and the fact that in the massless limit solutions may not reduce to those of general relativity ( gr ) have been the two main obstacles for a successful lagrangian construction @xcite . both of these problems are related to the scalar sector of the theory . in recent years",
    ", new developments have opened a window into a ghost - free model for massive gravity @xcite , based on the request that the equation of motion for the scalar mode does not contain derivatives of order higher than two @xcite . however , with respect to the second issue the story is not entirely settled , as we will discuss here .    in this massive gravity theory ,",
    "spherically symmetric solutions do not obey a uniqueness principle , like birkhoff s theorem in general relativity . as a result ,",
    "the theory exhibits two classes of static spherically symmetric solutions , which differ in how the scalar sector couples to graviton .",
    "the first class of solutions naturally contains ( anti ) de sitter - schwarzschild solutions , where the cosmological constant is proportional to the graviton s mass @xcite .",
    "some of these solutions are very similar to those found many years ago in the simple fierz - pauli model @xcite , and what characterises them is that the scalar mode is strongly coupled everywhere , which avoids a discontinuous connection to gr in the massless limit .",
    "therefore , at the level of the background , these solutions are indistinguishable from their counterparts in general relativity , but do present differences at first orders in perturbations .",
    "interestingly , in some of these solutions , scalar and vector perturbations are not dynamical at first order in perturbations , and only the tensor modes differ significantly from general relativity @xcite . if the scalar and vector modes remain non - dynamical at higher orders in perturbation theory , then only the detection of gravitational waves can rule out these solutions in favour of @xmath0cdm .    in the second class of solutions the story is not that clear .",
    "the scalar sector is not strongly coupled everywhere , and the solutions behave very differently as a function of the radial coordinate .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to exhibit the rich structure of such class of solutions , and show whether one can recover gr solutions in the massless limit , at least within some radial region .",
    "this phenomenon of recovering gr predictions within some macroscopic radius from a mass source is known as the vainshtein mechanism @xcite . in the range where the solution reduces to gr the scalar field",
    "becomes strongly coupled .",
    "therefore , it is imperative to include non - linearities in the scalar sector in order to study the vainshtein mechanism .",
    "solutions presenting these behaviour in massive gravity where found in @xcite , and more recently in the ghost - free model considered here in @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , these solutions do not cover the whole parameter space of the theory as we will describe here .",
    "we organise the paper as follows : in section 2 we give an overview of the main equations describing the theory and spherically symmetric solutions , with particular attention to this second branch . in section 3",
    "we present an exhaustive analysis of the vacuum equations , with particular attention to the behaviour of their solutions near the origin and towards infinity . in section 4",
    "we present our main results , including the parameter space in which gr solutions are recovered via the vainshtein mechanism and numerical solutions of the vacuum equations for some representative cases .",
    "finally , we present some conclusions in section 5 .",
    "we consider the following lagrangian for massive gravity , a non - linear extension of fierz - pauli theory proposed in @xcite [ genlag ] l = ( r - u ) .",
    "the potential @xmath1 depends on a dimension - full parameter @xmath2 , which sets the graviton mass scale , and on two dimensionless parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "it has the following functional form = -m^2 , [ potentialu ] with _",

    ". the tensor @xmath8 is a fiducial metric , which also makes the theory reparametrisation invariant by means of four scalars @xmath9 , and it is given by _ = _ ^a_^b_ab .",
    "the theory defined by ( [ genlag ] ) has minkowski spacetime as solution , hence one can rewrite the metric @xmath10 and the scalars @xmath9 as deviations from flat space , namely g_=_+h_,^=x^+^ , where @xmath11 are the usual cartesian coordinates spanning @xmath12 . therefore , a change of coordinates @xmath13 should be accompanied by the following transformation of the stckelberg field @xmath14 , [ pi_trans ] ^ ^ + ^ , in order to recover full diffeomorphism invariance . moreover , we choose the _ unitary _ gauge , where @xmath15 , and the potential ( [ potentialu ] ) considerably simplifies .",
    "since we are intested in spherically symmetric solutions , we use the most general static anstze , given by [ genmetr ] d",
    "s^2=-c(r ) d t^2+a(r ) d r^2 + 2 d(r ) dt dr+b(r ) d ^2 , where @xmath16 .",
    "we choose to write the non - dynamical flat metric as @xmath17 .",
    "it should be noticed that this is not a coordinate choice , but a way to simplify the expressions .",
    "we plug the previous metric into the einstein equations @xmath18 , where the energy momentum tensor is defined as @xmath19 .",
    "the einstein tensor @xmath20 satisfies the identity @xmath21 , which implies the algebraic constraint @xmath22 .",
    "this last equation reduces to @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is a function of @xmath3 and @xmath4 only @xcite .",
    "this constraint is solved in two possible ways , defining two class of solutions : either the metric is diagonal @xmath25 , or @xmath26 .",
    "notice that this classification only holds in the unitary gauge , since one can always map the metric from one class to the other by a coordinate transformation , but to the price of exciting components of @xmath14 .",
    "the class of solutions with a non - diagonal metric leads to schwarzschild or schwarzschild - de sitter solutions @xcite , as explained in the introduction . in this sector of the theory gr",
    "is recovered by means of a strongly coupled @xmath14 everywhere @xcite . however , in the other class of solutions , where the metric is diagonal in the unitary gauge , the situation is different . as we discuss in the next section , @xmath14 may or may not be strongly coupled : it could be strongly coupled within certain radial region , leading to a vainshtein effect .",
    "this branch is the one that concerns us here , so from now on we will only consider static diagonal spherically symmetric solutions in the unitary gauge ( see @xcite for a similar discussion on bimetric solutions in the unitary gauge ) .",
    "the problem of finding exact vacuum solutions in this branch is an open question , but one can make progresses by considering perturbations ( not necessarily small ) from flat space , and the following ansatz results adequate for this purpose , ds^2 = - ( 1+n(r))^2 dt^2 + ( 1+f(r))^-1 dr^2 + r^2 ( 1+h(r))^-2 d ^2 .",
    "[ diagonal ] in order to analyse the system , it is convenient to introduce a new radial coordinate = , [ chcoord ] so that the linearised metric is expressed as ds^2 = - ( 1 + n ) dt^2 + ( 1 - f ) d^2 + ^2 d ^2 , where @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and a prime denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath30 . as discussed above , one should be careful with this change of coordinates , since , after fixing a gauge , a change of frame in the metric modifies the stckelberg field @xmath14 as well .",
    "it turns out that this coordinate transformation excites the radial component of @xmath14 , which explicitly is @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , from now on one can think of @xmath32 as simply being the only non - zero component of the stckelberg field @xmath14 . at linear order ,",
    "the equations for the functions @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 in the new variable @xmath30 are [ neq ] 0&= & ( m^2 ^ 2 + 2)f+2 ( f+m^2 ^2 h+3 m^2 h ) , + 0&= & m^2 ^2 ( n-4 h ) - n-f , [ feq ] + 0&= & f + n[const ] . in this linear expansion ,",

    "these solutions exhibit the vdvz discontinuity , since the post - newtonian parameter @xmath40 is @xmath41 , which in the massless limit reduces to @xmath42 , in disagreement with gr and solar system observations .    however , in order to understand what really happens in this limit , we must also analyse the behaviour of @xmath32 , or equivalently @xmath43 , as @xmath44 . to do this , we consider scales below the compton wavelength @xmath45 , and at the same time ignore higher order terms in @xmath46 . under these approximations , the equations of motion can still be truncated to linear order in @xmath37 and @xmath36 , but since @xmath32 is not necessarily small , we have to keep all non - linear terms in @xmath32 . in other words ,",
    "we take the usual weak field limit for the metric fields , but keep all non - linearities in the stckelberg field , since we expect regions where this field is strongly coupled .",

    "the previous expressions are the starting point of our analysis and classifications of solutions , which we will discuss in the next section .",
    "our aim is to scan the @xmath48 parameter phase space of theories , to understand how many solutions the system ( [ solf])-([solh ] ) admits , and characterise their ( asymptotic ) geometrical properties .    since the last equation ( [ solh ] )",
    "does not contain @xmath37 and @xmath36 , the field @xmath32 obeys a decoupled equation , thus once a solution of this equation is found , the gravitational potentials @xmath37 , @xmath36 are uniquely determined ( up to an integration constant ) by the other two equations ( [ solf ] ) and ( [ soln ] ) . therefore , we first focus on classifying the number and properties of solutions of ( [ solh ] ) in every point of the phase space , and then discuss the behaviour of the gravitational potentials correspondent to these solutions .      for notational convenience ,",

    "the last equation is an algebraic equation in @xmath32 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 ; at fixed @xmath58 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 it is , in fact , a polynomial equation of fifth degree in @xmath32 , except for the special case @xmath59 . in this particular case of @xmath60 ,",
    "the equation for @xmath32 becomes a cubic equation and it is possible to obtain solutions for @xmath32 and the metric perturbations exactly .",
    "these solutions were studied in @xcite and it was shown that the solutions exhibit the vainshtein mechanism . therefore , in what follows , we assume @xmath61 .",
    "it is difficult to find analytical solutions to this quintic equation , and it is not easy even to understand how many solutions it admits . in fact , even if a local solution is found in a radial interval , it is not , in general , possible to extend it to the whole radial domain , as we will explicitly see in the next section .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to determine exactly how many local solutions exist in a neighbourhood of @xmath62 , which we refer as _ asymptotic solutions _ , and also how many local solutions exist in a neighbourhood of @xmath63 , which we call _ inner solutions_. furthermore , we can find analytically their leading behaviour as a function of @xmath30 .",
    "any global solution of ( [ quintic ] ) should necessarily interpolate between one of the asymptotic solutions and one of the inner solutions . therefore , our aim is to understand , for each point in the @xmath64 phase space , whether and how the above solutions match .",
    "a systematic approach to vainshtein effects in covariant galileon theory was performed in @xcite , and in general scalar - tensor theories @xcite . however , in massive gravity a systematic treatment was not fully performed .",
    "the main difference between massive gravity and standard galileon theories is that in the latter case the fifth power of @xmath32 in equation ( [ solh ] ) is absent .",
    "the reason of this becomes particularly transparent when focussing on the decoupling limit .",
    "then one can see that , for @xmath65 , there is a mixing between @xmath66 and a combination of derivatives of the scalar graviton polarization , that can not be removed by field redefinitions .",
    "such derivative mixing of the scalar with gravity is not included in standard galileon models , and the corresponding equations of motion consequently miss its effect .",
    "implementing a suitable coordinate transformation @xcite , one can recognize that precisely the aforementioned mixing gives rise to the quintic term in @xmath32 in the equation ( [ solh ] ) .",
    "as we will discuss in what follows , the analysis associated with the quintic equation turning on a @xmath65 enriches considerably the properties of the phase space with respect to the case @xmath60 .      to be able to describe how the matching works in all the phase space , in principle we should study separately every point ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 ) .",
    "however , this is not necessary since equation ( [ quintic ] ) obeys a remarkable symmetry : defining the quintic function as [ quinticfunction ] q ( h ; a , , ) ^2 h^5 - ( ^2 + 2 ) h^3 + 3 ( +",
    "a ) h^2 - h - a it is simple to see that [ symmetry ] q ( ; , k , k^2 ) = q ( h ; a , , ) therefore if a local solution of ( [ quintic ] ) exists for a given @xmath67 within a certain radial interval , it would also be present for @xmath68 , for @xmath69 , with @xmath32 being replaced by @xmath70 and the radial interval rescaled by @xmath71{k}$ ] . as a result ,",
    "each point belonging to the @xmath72 part of the parabola @xmath73 of the phase space ( with @xmath74 any non - vanishing constant ) shares the same physics , hence having the same number of global solutions and matching properties .",
    "the same is true for the points belonging the @xmath75 part of the parabola .",
    "so , to understand the global structure of the phase space , it is sufficient to analyse one point for each of the half parabolas present in the phase space .",
    "it is worthwhile to point out that our starting equations ( [ solfab])-([quintic ] ) were constructed assuming @xmath76 , but in the following analysis we use the whole radial domain @xmath77 . on one hand , this allows us to characterise exactly the number and properties of solutions on large and small scales . on the other hand ,",
    "the picture we have in mind is that the compton wavelength of the gravitational field @xmath78 is of the same order of the hubble radius today , and that there is a huge hierarchy between @xmath79 and the gravitational radius @xmath80 , _ i.e. _ @xmath81 .",

    "interestingly , the leading term in the gravitational potentials scales as @xmath91 for large radii , the same scaling which we find in a de sitter spacetime .",
    "it is worthwhile to point out that , since we are working on scales below the compton wavelength of the gravitational field , `` asymptotically non - flat '' really means that ( from the non - truncated theory point of view ) the spacetime correspondent to this solution tends to a non - flat spacetime when the compton wavelength is approached . to understand the `` true '' asymptotic behaviour of this solution",
    ", one should use the non - truncated equations .",
    "note that , even if @xmath90 ( and so @xmath32 ) is much smaller than one , the gravitational potentials @xmath36 and @xmath37 can be very large ( as they behave like @xmath92 far from the origin in this case ) : therefore , the linear approximation of the non - truncated theory we used to obtain eqs .",

    "one concludes that only in the @xmath104 part of the phase space solutions may exhibit the vainshtein mechanism , but not necessarily for all values of @xmath105 . in the next subsection",
