    "we first consider the thermal sz effect , which typically has a larger amplitude and has a non - thermal spectrum ( see the  [ ov ] below for a discussion of the kinetic sz effect ) . the cmb fluctuations produced by the thermal sz effect have been studied using the press - schechter formalism ( see bartlett 1997 for a review ) , and on large scales using numerical simulations ( cen & ostriker 1992 ; scaramella , cen , & ostriker 1993 ) and semi - analytical methods ( persi et al .",

    "the integrated sachs - wolfe effect ( isw ) describes thermal cmb fluctuations produced by time variations of the gravitational potential along the photon path ( sachs & wolfe 1967 ) .",
    "linear density perturbations produce non - zero isw fluctuations in @xmath64 universe only .",
    "non - linear perturbations produce fluctuations for any geometry , an effect often called the rees - sciama effect ( rees & sciama 1968 ) .",
    "tuluie & laguna ( 1995 ) have shown that anisotropies due to intrinsic changes in the gravitational potentials of the inhomogeneities and anisotropies generated by the bulk motion of the structures across the sky generate cmb anisotropies in the range of @xmath65 on scales of about @xmath66 ( see also tuluie et al .",

    "gravitational lensing is produced by spatial perturbations in the gravitational potential along the line of sight ( see schneider , ehlers , & falco 1992 ; narayan & bartelmann 1996 ) .",
    "this effect does not directly generate cmb fluctuations , but modifies existing background fluctuations .",
    "the effect of lensing on the cmb power spectrum was calculated by seljak ( 1996b ) and metcalf & silk ( 1997 ) .",
    "recently , zaldarriaga & seljak ( 1998 ) included the lensing effect in their cmb spectrum code ( cmbfast ; seljak & zaldarriaga 1996 ) .",
    "we use this code to compute the absolute lensing correction @xmath69 to the standard cdm spectrum of figure  [ fig : cl_disc ] , including nonlinear evolution .",
    "the results are shown in table  [ tab : foregrounds ] and figure  [ fig : lnu ] .",
    "in addition to the effects discussed above , other extragalactic foregrounds can cause secondary anisotropies .",
    "for instance , patchy reionization produced by the first generation of stars or quasars can cause second order cmb fluctuations through the doppler effect ( aghanim et al .",
    "1996a , b ; gruzinov & hu 1998 ; knox , scoccimaro , & dodelson 1998 ; peebles & juzkiewicz 1998 ) . calculations of the spectrum of this effect are highly uncertain , but show that the resulting cmb fluctuations could be of the order of 1 @xmath70k on 10 arcminute scales , for extreme patchiness .",
    "more likely patchiness parameters make the effect negligible on these scales , but potentially important on arcminute scales .",
    "another potential extragalactic foreground is that produced by the kinetic sz effect from ly@xmath71 absorption systems , as was recently proposed by loeb ( 1996 ) .",
    "the resulting cmb fluctuations are of the order of a few @xmath70k on arcminute scales , and about one order of magnitude lower on 10 arcminute scales . because of the uncertainties in the models for these two foregrounds and because they are small on 10 arcminute scales , we do not include them in table  [ tab : foregrounds ] and figure  [ fig : lnu ] .",
    "an inspection of table  [ tab : foregrounds ] shows that , for , the power spectra of the largest extragalactic foregrounds considered are a factor of 5 below the primordial cdm spectrum . as can be seen in figure  [ fig : lnu ] , the dominant foregrounds for are discrete sources , the thermal sz effect and gravitational lensing .",
    "note that for planck surveyor , these three effects produce fluctuations which are close to the sensitivity of the instrument .",
    "the spectra of the ov and isw effects will produce fluctuations of the order of @xmath72k for , and are thus less important .",
    "the effect of gravitational lensing is now incorporated in cmb codes such as cmbfast , and can thus be taken into account in the estimation of cosmological parameters .",
    "the other two dominant extragalactic contributions , discrete sources and the thermal sz effect , must also be accounted for , but are more difficult to model .",
    "we focus on these two foregrounds in the following sections .",
    "note that , on large angular scales , extragalactic foregrounds produce relatively small fluctuations , and are thus not detectable in the cobe maps ( boughn & jahoda 1993 ; bennett et al .",
    "1993 ; banday et al.1996 ; kneissl et al .",
    "in this section , we use the existing literature to estimate the discrete source contribution to the 94 ghz channel . since discrete sources generally have spectra that differ from that of the cmb , this single - channel analysis should be viewed as being conservative .",
    "note , however , that for the sizable fraction of radio sources which have a flat spectrum ( see sokasian et al .",
    "1998 ) , a multi - channel analysis will not dramatically improve the source subtraction .",
    "indeed , the rayleigh - jeans ( rj ) temperature fluctuations produced by such sources ( with fluxes @xmath73 ) depend on frequency as @xmath74 since @xmath75 approximately for , and are thus indistinguishable from cmb fluctuations .",
    "source subtraction can also be improved by searching the time - ordered data for time - variability , which is common for radio sources .",
    "it can also be improved by cross - correlating the cmb maps with existing source catalogs ( eg . that by sokasian et al .",

    "<S> while the major contribution to the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies are the sought - after primordial fluctuations produced at the surface of last scattering , other effects produce secondary fluctuations at lower redshifts . here , we study the extragalactic foregrounds of the cmb in the context of the upcoming mission . </S>",
    "<S> we first survey the major extragalactic foregrounds and show that discrete sources , the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect , and gravitational lensing are the most dominant ones for . </S>",
    "<S> we then show that is expected to detect ( @xmath0 ) about 46 discrete sources directly with 94 ghz fluxes above 2 jy . the most prominent sz features on the cmb sky are rich clusters of galaxies . in particular , we show that the coma cluster will be clearly detected and marginally resolved by . </S>",
    "<S> we then consider a cosmological population of clusters , and show that should detect ( @xmath0 ) about 10 sz clusters directly . </S>",
    "<S> the mean sz fluxes of fainter clusters can be probed by cross - correlating with cluster positions extracted from existing catalogs . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , a -xbacs cross - correlation will be sensitive to clusters with @xmath1 mjy , and will thus provide a test of their virialization state and a measurement of their gas fraction . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we consider probing the hot gas on supercluster scales by cross - correlating the cmb with galaxy catalogs . assuming that galaxies trace the gas </S>",
    "<S> , we show that a cross - correlation between and the apm catalog should yield a marginal detection , or at least a four - fold improvement on the cobe upper limits for the _ rms _ compton @xmath2-parameter .    </S>",
