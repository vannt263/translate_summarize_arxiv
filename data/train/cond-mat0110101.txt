    "traffic is a realization of an open one - dimensional many - body system . recently ,",
    "popkov and schtz @xcite found that the fundamental diagram determines the phase diagram of such a system , at least for a very simple , yet exactly solvable toy model , the so called asymmetric exclusion process ( asep ) .",
    "in particular , the most important feature that influences the phase diagram is the number of extrema in the fundamental diagram .",
    "this is exactly the theme of this report .",
    "we present an extension of classical , macroscopic ( `` fluid - like '' ) traffic flow models .",
    "usually , it is assumed that the fundamental diagram is a one - hump function , however recent empirical results point to more complicated behaviour .",
    "it is impossible to assign a single flow function @xmath4 to the measured data - points in a certain density range .",
    "therefore , it can be speculated , that this scatter hides a more complicated behaviour of the fundamental diagram in this regime .",
    "we explore two qualitatively different forms of the safe velocity @xmath5 , the velocity to which the flow tends to relax , which leads from the usual one - hump behaviour of the flow density relation to a more complicated function that exhibits , depending on the relaxation parameter , one , two or three humps .",
    "obviously , real drivers may have different @xmath5functions , adding another source of dynamical complexity , which will not be discussed in this paper .",
    "if the behaviour of individual vehicles is not of concern , but the focus is more on aggregated quantities ( like density @xmath1 , mean velocity @xmath6 etc . )",
    ", one often describes the system dynamics by means of macroscopic , fluid - like equations .",
    "the form of these navier - stokes - like equations can be motivated from anticipative behaviour of the drivers .",
    "+ assume there is a safe velocity @xmath7 that only depends on the density @xmath1 .",
    "the driver is expected to adapt the velocity in a way that @xmath6 relaxes on a time scale @xmath8 to this desired velocity corresponding to the density at @xmath9 , @xmath10 if both sides are taylor - expanded to first order one finds @xmath11 inserting @xmath12 @xmath13 abbreviating @xmath14 with @xmath15 the payne equation @xcite is recovered : @xmath16 if one seeks the analogy to the hydrodynamic equations one can identify a `` traffic pressure '' @xmath17",
    ". in this sense traffic follows the equation of state of a perfect gas ( compare to thermodynamics : @xmath18 ) .",

    "we use @xmath25 ms@xmath26 , @xmath27 ms@xmath26 and @xmath28 m@xmath29s@xmath26 .",
    "the form of the safe velocity @xmath7 plays an important role in this class of models ( as can be seen , for example , from the linear stability analysis of the @xmath30 model ) .",
    "however , experimentally the relation between this desired velocity and the vehicle density is poorly known .",
    "it is reasonable to assume a maximum at vanishing density and once the vehicle bumpers touch , the velocity will ( hopefully ) be zero .",
    "+ to study the effect of the additional term in the equations of motion we first investigate the case of the conventional safe velocity given by a fermi - function of the form @xcite @xmath31 since @xmath7 is at present stage rather uncertain , we also examine the effects of a more complicated relation between the desired velocity @xmath7 and the density @xmath1 . for this reason we look at a velocity - density relation that has a plateau at intermediate densities , which , in a microscopic interpretation , means that in a certain density regime drivers do not care about the exact distance to the car ahead .",

    "the parameters @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 m s@xmath26 are used throughout this study , the corresponding safe velocity and flow are shown in fig .",
    "note that the densities are always normalized with respect to their maximum possible value @xmath38 which is given by the average vehicle length as @xmath39 .",
    "we use a lagrangian particle scheme to solve the navier - stokes - like equations for traffic flow . a particle method similar to the smoothed particle hydrodynamics method",
    "( sph ; @xcite ) has been used previously to simulate traffic flow @xcite , the method we use here , however , differs in the way the density and the derivatives are calculated .",
    "the particles correspond to moving interpolation centers that carry aggregated properties of the vehicle flow , like , for example , the vehicle density @xmath1 .",
    "they are not to be confused with single `` test vehicles '' in the flow , they rather correspond to `` a bulk '' of vehicles .",
    "+ the first step in this procedure is to define , what is meant by the term `` vehicle density '' .",
    "since we assign a number indicating the corresponding vehicle number @xmath40 to each particle @xmath41 with position @xmath42 , the density definition is straight forward , i.e. the number of vehicles per length that can be assigned unambiguously to particle @xmath41 , or    @xmath43    once this is done one has to decide in which way spatial derivatives are to be evaluated .",
    "one possibility would be to take finite differences of properties at the particle positions .",
    "however , one has to keep in mind that the particles are not necessarily distributed equidistantly and thus in standard finite differences higher order terms do not automatically cancel out _",
    "exactly_. the introduced errors may be appreciable in the surrounding of a shock and they can trigger numerical instabilities that prevent further integration of the system .",
    "therefore we decided to evaluate first order derivatives as the _ analytical derivatives _ of cubic spline interpolations through the particle positions .",
    "second order derivatives of a variable @xmath44 are evaluated using centered finite differences    @xmath45    where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are evaluated by spline interpolation and @xmath48 is an appropriately chosen discretisation length . since we do not evolve the `` weights '' @xmath40 in time , there is no need to handle a continuity equation , the total vehicle number @xmath49 is constant and given as @xmath50 + denoting the left hand side of ( [ modeq ] ) in lagrangian form @xmath51 , we are left with a first order system : @xmath52 this set of equations is integrated forward in time by means of a fourth order accurate runge - kutta integrator with adaptive time step . + the described scheme is able to resolve emerging shock fronts sharply without any spurious oscillations .",
    "an example of such a shock front is shown in fig .",
    "[ shockfront ] for the @xmath30-model .",
    "traffic modelling as well as traffic measurements have a long - standing tradition ( e.g. greenshields @xcite , lighthill and whitham @xcite , richards @xcite , gazis et al .",
    "@xcite , treiterer @xcite , to name just a few ) . in recent years",
    "physicists working in this area have tried to interpret and formulate phenomena encountered in traffic flow in the language of non - linear dynamics ( see , for example , the review of kerner @xcite and many of the references cited therein ) .",
    "the measured real - world data reveal a tremendous amount of different phenomena many of which are also encountered in other non - linear systems .",
    "+ to identify properties of our model equations we apply them to a closed one - lane road loop .",
    "the loop has a length of @xmath53 km and we prepare initial conditions close to a homogeneous state with density @xmath54 ( i.e. same density and velocity everywhere ) .",
    "the system is slightly perturbed by a sinusoidal density perturbation of fixed maximum amplitude @xmath55 and a wavelength equal to the loop length .",
    "the particles are initially distributed equidistantly , the weights @xmath40 are assigned according to ( [ dens ] ) in order to reproduce the desired density distribution , and the velocities corresponding to @xmath5 are used .",
    "all calculations are performed using 500 particles . + it is important to keep in mind that the results are only partly comparable to real world data since the latter may reflect the response of the non - linear system to external perturbations like on - ramps , accidents etc . which are not included in the model .",
    "+ in the following the model parameter @xmath8 , which determines the time scale on which the flow tries to adapt on @xmath7 , is allowed to vary .",
    "this corresponds to a varying acceleration capability of the flow due to a changing vehicle composition ( percentage trucks etc . ) .",
    "this parameter @xmath8 which is typically of the order of seconds controls a wide variety of different dynamical phenomena .",
    "a similar result has been found in @xcite for a microscopic car - following model .",

    "the velocity isocline , i.e. the @xmath59-points where the acceleration vanishes can be inferred from eq .",

    "are thus expected only for densities above @xmath62 , where @xmath60 approaches the abscissa , see fig .",
    "[ force_free_fd ] .",
    "the flow of the homogeneous and stationary solution has no fixed point in a strict sense since @xmath63 becomes extremely small at @xmath64 , but does not vanish exactly .",
    "however , this could easily be changed by choosing another form of @xmath7 .",
    "[ force_free_fd ] shows these `` force free velocities '' @xmath60 ( in the homogeneous and stationary limit ) together with the `` force free fundamental diagrams '' ( for @xmath65 s ) for both investigated forms of @xmath7 .",
    "we expect the fundamental diagrams ( fd ) found from the numerical analysis of the full equation set to be centered around these `` force free fundamental diagrams '' . while for the @xmath7 of the @xmath30-model the fd always ( i.e. for @xmath65 s ) exhibits a simple one - hump behaviour , eq .",
    "( [ vdes_eq ] ) leads to a one , two or three hump structure of the fd depending on the time constant @xmath8 .",
    "that is why a stronger dependence of qualitative features on this constant may be expected for the plateau safe velocity .",
    "note , however , that even with the conventional @xmath7 the `` force free velocity '' @xmath60 exhibits for @xmath66 s two additional extrema at intermediate densities ( up to four with the plateau function ) .",
    "the implications of these additional extrema for the stability of the flow are discussed below .",
    "+      to get a preliminary idea about the stability regimes of the model it is appropriate to perform a _ linear stability analysis_. by inserting ( [ vel_iso ] ) into the equations of motion we obtain equations that formally look like the equations of the @xmath30-model : @xmath67 the role of @xmath7 now being played by @xmath60 .",
    "thus with the appropriate substitution the _ linear stability criterion _ of @xcite can be used : @xmath68 \\frac { c_0}{\\rho}. \\label{stab_crit}\\ ] ] thus we expect the flow to be linearly unstable in density regimes where the decline of @xmath60 with @xmath1 is steeper than a given threshold .",
    "specifically , extrema of the @xmath69 are ( to linear order ) stable and we therefore expect _ stable density regions embedded in unstable regimes_.      the previous analytical considerations give a rough idea of what to expect , for a more complete analysis , however , we have to resort to a numerical treatment of the full equation set . in order to be able to distinguish the effects resulting from the additional term in the equations of motion from those coming from the form of @xmath7 we treat two cases separately : in the first case the conventional form of @xmath7 is used and in the second the effects due to a plateau in @xmath7 @xcite are investigated .      to obtain a * fundamental diagram * ( fd ) comparable to measurements we chose a fixed site on our road loop .",
    "we determine averages over one minute in the following way : @xmath70 and @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the number of particles that have passed the reference point within the last minute . the thus calculated fd ( fig .",
    "[ fd_alltau ] , left panel ) is , as expected , close to a superposition of the `` force - free fds '' , for different values of @xmath8 see fig .",
    "[ force_free_fd ] , left panel .",
    "as in real - world traffic data in the higher density regimes the flow is not an unambiguous function of @xmath1 , but rather covers a surface given by the range of @xmath8 in the measured data .",
    "note that many data points in the unstable regime ( see below ) exhibit substantially higher flows than expected from the `` force - free fds '' ( see fig .",
    "[ force_free_fd ] ) .",
    "+ in certain density ranges the model shows * instability * with respect to jam formation from an initial slight perturbation .",
    "in this regime the initial perturbation of the homogeneous state grows and finally leads to a breakdown of the flow into a backward moving jam ( kerner refers to this state , where vehicles come in an extended region to a stop , as `` wide jam '' ( wj ) contrary to a `` narrow jam '' ( nj ) which basically consists only of its upstream and downstream fronts and vehicles do not , on average , come to a stop ; @xcite ) .",
    "this phenomenon , widely known as `` jam out of nowhere '' , is reproducible with several traffic flow models ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "an example of a spontaneously forming wj accompanied by two njs is given in fig .",

    "it is interesting to note that the initial perturbation remains present in the system for approximately 15 minutes without noticeably growing in amplitude before the flow breaks down . as in reality",

    "one part of the njs propagates in the downstream direction ( see e.g.  the perturbations located at @xmath90 km at @xmath91 s ) while the rest ( at @xmath92 s at @xmath93 km ) move upstream .",
    "once the first wj has formed after approximately 500 s the njs start to merge with it .",

    "it seems to be aware of these states , but it is always heavily disturbed and never able to reach a stationary state .",
    "again , the composition of the traffic flow plays via @xmath8 _ the _ crucial role for the emerging phenomena .",
    "starting from the assumption that a safe velocity @xmath5 exists towards which drivers want to relax by anticipating the density ahead of them , we motivate a set of equations for the temporal evolution of the mean flow velocity .",

    "the results are compared to the use of a conventional form of @xmath7 .",
    "+ these fluid - like equations are solved using a lagrangian particle scheme , that formulates density in terms of particle properties and evaluates first order derivatives analytically by means of cubic spline interpolation and second order derivatives by equidistant finite differencing of the splined quantities .",
    "the continuity equation is fulfilled automatically by construction .",
    "this method is able to follow the evolution of the ( in some ranges physically unstable ) traffic flow in a numerically stable way and to resolve emerging shock - fronts accurately without any spurious oscillations .",
    "+ the presented model shows for both investigated forms of @xmath7 a large variety of phenomena that are well - known from real - world traffic data .",
    "for example , traffic flow is found to be unstable with respect to jam formation initiated by a subtle perturbation around the homogeneous state . as in reality",
    ", stable backward - moving _ wide jams _ as well as sharply localized _ narrow jams _ form .",

    "the encountered accelerations are in very good agreement with measured values . for the @xmath7 with plateau",
    "we also find states where a stable wide jam coexists with narrow jams that keep emerging and disappearing without ever leading to a breakdown of the flow , properties that are usually attributed to the elusive state of `` synchronized flow '' .",
    "another , striking phenomena is encountered that we call the `` mesa - effect '' : the flow may organize into a state , where platoons of high and low velocity follow each other , separated only by a very sharp , shock - like transition region .",
    "this pattern is found to be stationary , i.e. it moves forward without changing shape .",
    "one may speculate , that these mesa states are related to the minimum flow phase found in the work using the asep as a model for traffic flow @xcite .",
    "+ in other regions of parameter space the flow is never able to settle into a stationary state . here",
    "wide jams and a multitude of emerging moving or disappearing narrow jams may coexist for a very long time .",
    "again , it may be presumeded that in these cases the system displays deterministic chaos , however , we did not check this beyond any doubt .",
    "+ the basic effect of the new interaction term is to make the `` force - free velocity '' , which essentially determines the shape of the fundamental diagram , sensitive to the relaxation parameter @xmath8 . for large values of @xmath8 additional extrema in the `` force - free flows '' are introduced and a stability analysis shows that that the flows are stable against perturbations in the vicinity of these extrema .",
    "this leads to the emergence of alternating regimes of stability and instability , the details of which depend on the shape of @xmath7 .",
    "we find that if a pronounced plateau in @xmath7 really does exist , it should appear in the measured fundamental diagrams , at least for flows with poor acceleration capabilities , i.e. large @xmath8 s .",
    "+ the crucial parameter besides density which determines the dynamic evolution of the flow and all the related phenomena is the relaxation time @xmath8 .",
    "since this parameter governs the time scale on which the flow tries to adapt to the desired velocity @xmath7 , we may interpret it as a measure for the flow composition ( fraction of trucks etc . ) .",
    "it is this composition that determines whether / which structure formation takes place , whether the system relaxes into a homogeneous state , forms isolated wide jams or a multitude of interacting narrow jams .    to conclude",
    ", this work shows that a surprising richness of phenomena is encountered if one allows for a slight change of the underlying traffic flow equations .",
    "further work is needed in order to extend the qualitative description undertaken in this work and to find more quantitative relationships between the traffic flow models and reality ."
