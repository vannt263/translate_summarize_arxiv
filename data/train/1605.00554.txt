    "with the discovery of the @xmath7 higgs boson by the atlas and cms collaborations @xcite , one of the further goals of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) is to test the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "precision test of the sm at the lhc requires accurate and reliable phenomenological predictions .",
    "the measurement of the gauge couplings is one of the most important experiments to study the gauge structure of the sm .",
    "the gauge couplings are usually investigated by the vector boson production processes and most of these processes at the lhc have been computed up to the qcd next - to - leading order ( nlo ) so far .",
    "the measurement at @xmath3 will be possible in lhc run 2 with higher luminosity , and the sensitivity to electroweak ( ew ) couplings increases with the reach in the high - energy tails of distributions .",
    "the nlo qcd prediction alone may not deliver a reliable estimate as expected .",
    "theoretical precision predictions are therefore ahead of us to have a thorough interpretation of data , which can be realized by taking into account the ew information .",
    "it is desired for the calculation of vector boson production with nlo qcd+ew accuracy .",
    "the triple vector boson production is sensitive to the triple and quartic gauge couplings ( tgcs and qgcs ) and thus related to the ew symmetry breaking mechanism @xcite .",
    "the measurements of triple gauge boson production at hadron colliders can provide rich information on the gauge boson self - interactions and play an important role in probing new physics beyond the sm . in order to improve the precision of the theoretical predictions ,",
    "it is necessary to calculate the @xmath8 productions at hadron colliders up to the qcd+ew nlo including the subsequent vector boson decays , which are listed in the les houches 2015 precision sm wish list @xcite . in previous works ,",
    "all the triple gauge boson production processes at hadron colliders , i.e. , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath0 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , have been studied in the sm up to the qcd nlo @xcite , while only the @xmath9 , @xmath11 and @xmath10 processes have been complemented by the nlo ew corrections @xcite , and for the later two processes the subsequent @xmath18- and @xmath19-boson leptonic decays are included .    in this work , we present the nlo qcd+ew corrected integrated cross section and some kinematic distributions for the @xmath20 production at the lhc , including the subsequent @xmath18-boson leptonic decays .",
    "the observables in the @xmath0 production could be sensitive to both the triple and quartic vector boson couplings and thus relevant to the study of these anomalous gauge couplings @xcite .",
    "the nlo qcd correction to the @xmath0 production at the lhc was provided in refs.@xcite .",
    "we hereby extend the calculation for the @xmath0 production to the qcd+ew nlo including subsequent @xmath18-boson leptonic decays to provide more accurate predictions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we provide our calculation strategy . the integrated cross section and various kinematic distributions",
    "are presented in sec .",
    "finally , a summary is given in sec .",
    "in the lo and nlo qcd+ew calculations , we adopt the t hooft - feynman gauge , and only take into account the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) mixing between the first two quark generations .",
    "we set the masses of the first two generations of quarks to zero and adopt the four - flavor scheme in the initial - state parton convolution , therefore there is no bottom - quark - induced subprocess and the ckm matrix drops out in the flavor - summed closed quark loops .",
    "for all the partonic processes involved in the triple @xmath18-boson production at the qcd+ew nlo , i.e. , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , the ckm matrix can factorize from all the amplitudes and only one generic amplitude for each subprocess has to be evaluated in parton distribution function ( pdf ) convolution @xcite .",
    "the nlo qcd and nlo ew relative corrections for @xmath20 are given by @xmath26 where the superscripts @xmath27 and @xmath28 stand for the quark - antiquark and photon - induced subprocesses , respectively . unlike the qcd corrections from the quark - antiquark and gluon - induced channels , the ew corrections from the quark - antiquark and photon - induced subprocesses can be distinguished by their final - state products .",
    "the nlo corrections @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are evaluated with nlo pdfs , while @xmath32 and @xmath33 are lo cross sections calculated with lo and nlo pdfs , respectively . in eq.([relativeqcdc ] ) , @xmath29 and @xmath34 are the nlo qcd contributions from the dynamic matrix element and pdfs , respectively .",
    "the nlo ew correction is normalized by @xmath35 in order to cancel the qcd contribution from the nlo pdfs .",
    "therefore , @xmath36 defined in eq.([relativeewc ] ) is the genuine nlo ew relative correction which is practically independent of the pdf set .",
    "the pure nlo qcd corrected cross section @xmath37 can be expressed as @xmath38 in order to include the potentially large contribution from the interplay between the ew and qcd corrections beyond the nlo , we calculate the combined nlo qcd+ew correction by using the naive product @xcite @xmath39 this definition is particularly used in observables that receive extremely large qcd correction .    at the parton level",
    ", the @xmath40 production is just the cp conjugation of the @xmath2 production . within the cp - conserved sm ,",
    "the only difference between the @xmath40 and @xmath2 productions at the lhc is the initial - state parton convolution .",
    "therefore , we describe the lo and nlo calculations only for the @xmath41 process in the following . at the lowest order the @xmath2 is produced via the quark - antiquark annihilation , i.e. , @xmath42 .",
    "we can see clearly that the @xmath12 , @xmath43 tgcs and @xmath44 qgc are involved in some lo feynman diagrams for the @xmath45 partonic process .",
    "the final produced @xmath18-bosons are unstable particles .",
    "we will consider their leptonic decays in investigating the triple @xmath18-boson production at the lhc .",
    "the madspin method @xcite is an improved narrow - width approximation based on frixione - laenen - motylinski - webber ( flmw ) @xcite approach which performs well in preserving the spin correlation and finite - width effects . in flmw approach , the off - shell effect is kept by smearing the mass of each resonance according to a breit - wigner distribution , and the spin correlation information is retained based on the acceptance - rejection method to generate the decay configuration . in this work",
    "we study only the triple physical @xmath18-boson production with subsequent leptonic decays , i.e. , @xmath46 , while the @xmath47 process is not included .",
    "we adopt the madspin method in both the nlo qcd and nlo ew calculations to generate the final events in order to preserve the spin correlation and finite - width effects as far as possible .",
    "we firstly transform the differential cross sections for the @xmath20 process into les houches event files @xcite .",
    "afterwards we input these event files to the madspin program , which is a part of madgraph5_amc@nlo package @xcite , to generate the events after @xmath18-boson leptonic decays preserving both spin correlation and @xmath18-boson finite - width effects in a very good accuracy .",
    "the ultraviolet ( uv ) and infrared ( ir ) safety of physical observables requires the cancelation of singularities to all orders . in our calculation",
    ", the singularities are isolated by using the dimensional regularization ( dr ) scheme in @xmath48 dimensions .",
    "we adopt the on - mass - shell scheme to renormalize the masses and wave functions for the nlo qcd and ew corrections .",
    "the analytic expressions for the related ew renormalization constants and the unrenormalized ew self - energies can be found in ref.@xcite .      after performing the renormalization procedure , the qcd / ew one - loop virtual correction to the @xmath45 partonic process is uv finite but still contains soft and collinear ir singularities .",
    "the cancelation of ir singularities at qcd / ew nlo requires the gluon / photon bremsstrahlung .",
    "the soft ir singularity is canceled exactly by that in the real gluon / photon bremsstrahlung , while the collinear ir singularity is only partially canceled and the remaining collinear ir singularity is absorbed by the collinear gluon / photon emission part of the related quark pdf qcd / ew counterterms .",
    "the analytic expressions for the quark pdf qcd and ew counterterms are provided in ref.@xcite .",
    "the feynman amplitudes are created and simplified by using the modified feynarts-3.7 @xcite and formcalc-7.3 @xcite packages .",
    "the one - loop amplitude is expressed as a linear combination of multi - point integrals .",
    "the 5-point integrals are directly reduced to 4-point integrals by using the denner - dittmaier method @xcite , and all the @xmath83-point ( @xmath84 ) tensor integrals are computed by means of the passarino - veltman reduction formalism @xcite . in the calculation of 4-point tensor integrals with rank @xmath85 ,",
    "the numerical instability would occur at some phase - space region with small gram determinant .",
    "we developed the codes for loop calculation based on the looptools-2.8 package @xcite , which can switch to the quadruple precision automatically in the region of @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the gram determinant and @xmath88 the maximum of the external four - momentum squared for a given 4-point integral , and @xmath89 is set to @xmath90 in this work .",
    "this algorithm to solve unstable problem does not consume too much computer cpu time .",
    "the qcd / ew real correction to the parent process @xmath91 originates from the gluon / photon bremsstrahlung and gluon / photon - induced channels .",
    "we adopt the two cutoff phase space slicing ( tcpss ) technique @xcite to isolate the ir singularities for the gluon / photon bremsstrahlung partonic process @xmath92 .",
    "two cutoffs @xmath93 and @xmath94 are introduced to separate the phase space into soft ( @xmath95 ) , hard collinear ( @xmath96 @xmath97 ) and hard noncollinear ( @xmath98 , @xmath99 ) regions , where @xmath100 and @xmath101 is the colliding energy in the center - of - mass system .",
    "the soft and collinear ir singularities are located in the soft and hard collinear regions , respectively , while the phase - space integration over the hard noncollinear region is ir finite .",
    "different from the gluon / photon bremsstrahlung , the gluon / photon - induced partonic channel @xmath102 only contains collinear ir singularity , which can be canceled exactly by the collinear quark emission part of the related pdf counterterms .",
    "therefore , the phase space is only separated into collinear ( @xmath103 ) and noncollinear ( @xmath104 ) regions for the isolation of the collinear ir singularity .",
    "the @xmath105 qcd correction to the triple @xmath18-boson production at the lhc has already been investigated in refs.@xcite , but the intermediate higgs boson exchange and @xmath18-boson leptonic decays were not taken into account in ref.@xcite . to check the correctness of our calculation , we make a comparison with the results in refs.@xcite by using the same inputs and settings as in ref.@xcite . from table",
    "[ tab1 ] we see clearly that all these numerical results are in good agreement with each other within the monte carlo errors .",

    "<S> in this paper we calculate the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd and electroweak ( ew ) corrections to the @xmath0 production with subsequent leptonic decays at the lhc by adopting an improved narrow - width approximation which takes into account the spin correlation and finite - width effects from the @xmath1-boson decays . the nlo qcd correction from the real jet radiation </S>",
    "<S> is discussed , which significantly enhances the production rate , particularly in high energy region . </S>",
    "<S> we also provide the integrated cross section for the @xmath0 production and various kinematic distributions of final products at the qcd+ew nlo . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the convergence of the perturbative qcd description can be improved by applying a hard jet veto in the event selection , but this jet veto would introduce a new source of theoretical uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> the pure nlo qcd relative correction to the integrated cross section for the @xmath2 production at the @xmath3 lhc is @xmath4 in the jet - veto event selection scheme with @xmath5 , while the genuine nlo ew relative correction can reach @xmath6 in the inclusive event selection scheme . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical results show that both the nlo qcd and nlo ew corrections should be taken into consideration in precision predictions .    </S>",
