    "the properties of open and hidden charm mesons in a hot dense environment are being the focus of recent analysis . indeed ,",
    "part of the physics program of the panda and cbm experiments at the future fair facility at gsi @xcite will search , among others , for in - medium modification of hadrons in the charm sector , providing a first insight into the charm - nucleus interaction .",
    "the in - medium modification of the properties of open - charm mesons may lead to formation of @xmath0-mesic nuclei @xcite , and will also affect the renormalization of charm and hidden - charm scalar hadron resonances in nuclear matter , providing information not only about their nature but also about the interaction of the open - charm mesons with nuclei .",
    "in the present paper we obtain the open - charm spectral functions in dense matter within a self - consistent approach in coupled channels , and analyze the effect on the properties of dynamically - generated charm and hidden charm scalar resonances and provide some insight into the formation of @xmath0-nucleus bound states .",
    "the self - energy in symmetric nuclear matter for open - charm pseudoscalar ( @xmath0 ) and vector ( @xmath6 ) mesons is obtained following a self - consistent coupled - channel procedure .",
    "the transition potential of the bethe - salpeter equation for different isospin , total angular momentum , and finite density and temperature is derived from effective lagrangians , which will be discussed in the next subsection .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath6 self - energies are then obtained summing the transition amplitude for the different isospins over the nucleon fermi distribution at a given temperature ( see details in refs .",
    "@xcite ) . then , the meson spectral function reads @xmath7 with @xmath8 being the self - energy at given energy @xmath9 , momentum @xmath10 , density @xmath11 and temperature @xmath12 .",

    "[ fig1],title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0%,height=188 ]    the open - charm meson spectral functions are obtained from the bethe - salpeter equation in coupled - channels taking , as bare interaction , two kinds of bare potential .",
    "first , we consider a type of broken @xmath13 @xmath14-wave weinberg - tomozawa ( wt ) interaction supplemented by an attractive isoscalar - scalar term and using a cutoff regularization scheme .",
    "we fix this cutoff by generating dynamically the @xmath15 @xmath16 resonance . a new resonance in @xmath17 channel , @xmath18 ,",
    "is generated @xcite .",
    "the in - medium solution incorporates pauli blocking , baryon mean - field bindings and meson self - energies @xcite . in l.h.s . of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we display the @xmath0 meson spectral function for different momenta , temperatures and densities . at @xmath19",
    "the spectral function shows two peaks : the @xmath20 and the quasi(d)-particle peak mixed with the @xmath21 .",
    "those states dilute with increasing temperature while the quasiparticle peak gets closer to its free value .",
    "finite density results in a broadening of the spectral function because of the increased phase space .",
    "secondly , heavy - quark symmetry ( hqs ) is implemented by treating on equal footing heavy pseudoscalar and vector mesons , such as the @xmath0 and @xmath6 mesons .",
    "the @xmath22 wt includes pseudoscalars and vector mesons together with @xmath23 and @xmath24 baryons @xcite .",
    "this symmetry is , however , strongly broken in nature and we adopt the physical hadron masses and different weak non - charmed and charmed pseudoscalar and vector meson decay constants .",
    "we also improve on the regularization scheme in matter beyond the cutoff method @xcite .    in this scheme ,",
    "all resonances in the @xmath13 model are reproduced and new resonant states are generated @xcite due to the enlarged fock space .",
    "however , the nature of some of those resonances is different regarding the model .",
    "while the @xmath16 emerges as a @xmath25 quasibound state in the @xmath13 model , it becomes predominantly a @xmath26 quasibound state in the @xmath22 scheme .",
    "the modifications of these resonances in the nuclear medium strongly depend on the coupling to @xmath0 , @xmath6 and @xmath27 and are reflected in the spectral functions . on the r.h.s of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we display the @xmath0 and @xmath6 spectral functions , which show then a rich spectrum of resonance ( @xmath28)-hole(@xmath29 ) states . as density increases ,",
    "these @xmath30 modes tend to smear out and the spectral functions broaden with increasing phase space , as seen for the @xmath13 model @xcite .",

    "the analysis of the properties of scalar resonances in nuclear matter is crucial in order to understand their nature , whether they are @xmath33 , molecules , mixtures of @xmath33 with meson - meson components , or dynamically generated resonances from meson - meson scattering .    in the following we study the charmed resonance @xmath34 @xcite together with a hidden charm scalar",
    "meson , @xmath31 , predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite , which might have been observed @xcite by the belle collaboration @xcite .",
    "those resonances are generated dynamically by solving the coupled - channel bethe - salpeter equation for two pseudoscalar mesons @xcite .",
    "the @xmath34 mainly couples to the @xmath35 , while the hidden charm state @xmath31 couples most strongly to @xmath36 .",
    "thus , any change in the @xmath0 meson properties in nuclear matter will have an important effect on these resonances .",
    "the @xmath0 meson self - energy is given in the @xmath13 model without the phenomenological isoscalar - scalar term , but supplemented by the @xmath37-wave self - energy @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the @xmath34 ( left ) and @xmath31 ( middle ) resonances are displayed via the squared transition amplitude for the corresponding dominant channel at different densities .",
    "the @xmath34 and @xmath31 resonances , which have a zero and small width , develop widths of the order of 100 and 200 mev at normal nuclear matter density , respectively .",
    "this is due to the opening of new many - body decay channels as the @xmath0 meson gets absorbed in the nuclear medium via @xmath25 and @xmath38 inelastic reactions .",
    "we do not extract any clear conclusion for the mass shift .",
    "we suggest to look at the transparency ratio to investigate those in - medium widths , since it is very sensitive to the in - medium width of the resonance .",
    "@xmath0-meson bound states in @xmath39pb were predicted @xcite relying upon an attractive @xmath0 meson potential .",
    "the observation of those bound states might be , though , problematic due to their widths , as in the case of the su(4 ) model @xcite .",
    "however , for the scheme with hqs @xcite the @xmath0 meson in nuclear matter has a sufficiently small width with respect to the mass shift to form bound states in nuclei .    in order to compute de @xmath0-nucleus bound states",
    ", we solve the schrdinger equation .",
    "we concentrate on @xmath32-nucleus bound states @xcite .",
    "the potential that enters in the equation is an energy - dependent one that results from the zero - momentum @xmath0-meson self - energy within the su(8 ) model @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( right ) we show @xmath32 meson bound states in different nuclei .",
    "we observe that the @xmath32-nucleus states are weakly bound , in contrast to previous results @xcite .",
    "their experimental detection is , though , difficult .",
    "open - charm mesons ( @xmath0 and @xmath6 ) in dense matter have been studied within a self - consistent coupled - channel approach taking , as bare interaction , different effective lagrangians .",
    "the in - medium solution accounts for pauli blocking effects and meson self - energies .",
    "we have analyzed the evolution in matter of the open - charm meson spectral functions and discussed their effects on the @xmath34 and the predicted @xmath31 in nuclear matter , and suggested to look at transparency ratios to investigate the in - medium width of those resonances .",
    "we have finally analyzed the possible formation of @xmath0-mesic nuclei .",
    "only weakly bound @xmath32-nucleus states seem to be feasible within the su(8 ) scheme that incorporates heavy - quark symmetry . however , its experimental detection is most likely a challenging task .",
