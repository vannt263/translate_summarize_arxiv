    "the eigenvalue problem of a one - body 1d schrdinger operator is the most fundamental subject in quantum mechanics .",
    "still , it provides vivid materials of research .    besides a few exceptions where eigenvalues and wavefunctions are obtainable explicitly",
    ", one may employ several tools for analysis , e.g. , the perturbation theory , the variational approach and so on . among them , the exact wkb method @xcite-@xcite is unique in the sense that it provides non - perturbative information on the analytical structure of wavefunctions and spectral properties .",
    "we analytically continue @xmath3 , original coordinate variable , to a complex number .",
    "the whole complex plane is divided into several sectors . in each sectors , there are two linearly independent solutions , as schrdinger operator is the 2nd order differential operator .",
    "they are referred to as the fundamental system of solutions ( fss ) in the sector @xcite .",
    "the relations among fss in different sectors are central issue in the connection problem .",
    "the importance of the problem and consequently stokes multipliers , in the wkb problem has been deeply recognized and emphasized in early 80 , especially in @xcite .    recently , a remarkable link has been established among the spectral determinants of a 1d schrdinger operator associated with the anharmonic oscillator , transfer matrices and @xmath4 operators in cft possessing @xmath5 @xcite-@xcite . here",
    "the spectral determinants imply @xmath6 and its generalizations . a curious interplay between @xmath7 and generalized stokes multipliers",
    "is also found @xcite . in view of solvable models ,",
    "a striking fact is that they share the same functional relations with transfer matrices in the fusion hierarchy possessing @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "this allows for applications of the strong machineries in the study of solvable models @xcite-@xcite to the studies of stokes multipliers , spectral determinants and so on .",
    "several results have been explicitly obtained for the anharmonic oscillator problem , and are extended to higher differential analogues @xcite .    in this note",
    ", we consider an anharmonic oscillator perturbed by a lower power potential term .",
    "it belongs to a class of potentials discussed generally in @xcite with the exact resolution method . to be precise",
    ", we consider the eigenvalue problem , @xmath8 throughout this report we set @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the spectral problem concerning this hamiltonian turns out to be in a category to which one can apply the tools in solvable models .",
    "the sign of @xmath11 seems to be crucial if one considers the operator ( [ hamil ] ) on the real axis .",
    "@xmath12    we will not expect much difference from the `` pure '' anharmonic oscillator when @xmath13 , while we do expect change for @xmath14 as the potential develops the double well .",
    "it will be shown , however , that the negative @xmath11 and the positive @xmath11 problems are not separable when we discuss the global connection problem .",
    "roughly speaking , the negative @xmath11 problem is coupled to the positive @xmath11 problem by crossing a border line of neighboring sectors and vice versa .",
    "see  2 for precise arguments",
    ". it may be then reasonable to consider a two - fold connection problem ( crossing two adjacent lines ) , or more generally , relations between sectors separated by even multiples of border lines .",
    "some of the stokes multipliers , in the generalized connection problem , possess expressions corresponding to the eigenvalues of the ( fusion ) transfer matrices of the 3 state perk - schulz ( ps ) model @xcite of which underlying symmetry is @xmath1 .",
    "others can not be directly equated with the ( fusion ) transfer matrices but have relations with the the 3 state ps model as well .",
    "thus we conclude that the perturbation @xmath15 breaks the @xmath5 symmetry of the `` pure '' anharmonic oscillator but it brings the new symmetry @xmath1 .",
    "the deformation parameter @xmath16 is related to the exponent of the perturbation by @xmath17 . through these findings",
    ", we can derive the nonlinear integral equations ( nlie ) which characterize the energy levels of both the negative @xmath11 problem and the positive @xmath11 problem simultaneously .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we will explore symmetries of solutions to ( [ hamil ] ) .",
    "the precise definition of sectors is given .",
    "the connection problem is addressed in section 3 .",
    "certain components in fusion stokes matrices are identified with eigenvalues of fusion transfer matrices associated to @xmath1 . the spectral determinant is explicitly parameterized by fss in a sector .",
    "the coupled nlie are then derived in section4 , which determine energy levels .",
    "we will perform analytical and numerical checks on the consistency of our result in section 5 .",
    "section 6 is devoted to summary and discussions on open problems .",
    "let @xmath18 be an entire function of @xmath19 and a solution to @xmath20 .",
    "the solution , which decays exponentially at @xmath21 , is of primary interest . by employing the argument in @xcite",
    ", we immediately find its asymptotic behavior ,    @xmath22    the validity of the above expansion is not restricted to the real axis , but extends to the wedge , @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "the second order linear differential equation admits another independent solution . to specify it , or to deal with the global problem , it is convenient to extend @xmath3 to the complex plane as mentioned in introduction . then , as in the case of @xmath24 , the solution exhibits a symmetry by rotating the complex @xmath3 plane by a specific angle .",
    "the direct calculation proves the following .",
    "let @xmath25 be the above solution and @xmath17 .",
    "then @xmath26 is also the solution to the differential equation , @xmath27 .",
    "this is the desired second solution which grows exponentially on the positive real axis : @xmath28 for @xmath29 we note that @xmath30 .",
    "this deserves an attention .",
    "as mentioned in introduction , the potential assumes the completely different structure for @xmath11 positive and @xmath11 negative on the real axis .",
    "the rotation in the complex @xmath3 plane by angle @xmath31 , however , couples these two problems .",
    "thus we shall treat the hamiltonians with @xmath2 _ simultaneously_. similar pairing of differential equations is found for the positive and the negative angular momentum terms in a class of 3rd order differential equations@xcite .",
    "this observation is crucial in our approach and can be generalized further . to state it",
    ", we prepare some notations .    hereafter @xmath11 always takes a non - negative real value . by @xmath32 ,",
    "we mean the schrdinger operator , @xmath33 where @xmath34 .",
    "let @xmath35 be a sector in the plane satisfying @xmath36    @xmath37    the fss depends on the sector .",
    "we conveniently define @xmath38    for the @xmath32 , the fss in the sector @xmath39 is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 .    for @xmath24 case ,",
    "this has been argued in @xcite .",
    "it is easily checked that @xmath42 is the sub - dominant solution in @xmath43 ; it tends to zero as @xmath3 tends to infinity along in any direction in the sector .    in the next section ,",
    "we consider the global connection problem of these fss in the complex @xmath3 plane .",
    "we introduce the wronskian matrix @xmath44 and the wronskian @xmath45 .",
    "the linear dependence of the solution can be easily verified by evaluating the wronskian at @xmath46 using the asymptotic expansions ( [ asymptotics ] ) and ( [ asymptotics2 ] ) .",
    "the present normalization yields @xmath47 .",
    "let @xmath48 be the stokes matrix connecting the wronskian matrices @xmath49 and @xmath50 , @xmath51 it permits an explicit parameterization    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is referred to as the stokes multiplier .",
    "we have two remarks .",
    "first , the ( 1,1 ) element is the function of @xmath11 and @xmath54 .",
    "we omit the dependency on @xmath11 .",
    "the dependency on @xmath55 is indicated by the index @xmath56 .",
    "second , the ( 2,1 ) element,@xmath57 , is a consequence of the present normalization of the wronskian .    to be more specific ,",
    "we consider the operator @xmath58 and start from the positive real axis ( or more generally @xmath59 ) .",
    "the initial fss is @xmath60 .",
    "@xmath61    a linear relation follows from ( [ single ] ) between this fss and @xmath62 , the fss at the neighboring sector @xmath63 , @xmath64 similarly , the fss in @xmath65 is linked to the fss in @xmath63 by @xmath66    judging from the upper indices which indicate the corresponding signs of @xmath11 , it may be natural to introduce a generalized stokes matrix @xmath67 connecting fss @xmath60 and @xmath68 .",
    "it is simply obtained by the matrix multiplication ,    @xmath69    equations ( [ taupy ] ) and ( [ taumy ] ) yield @xmath70 s in terms of @xmath71 s . the ( 1,1 ) component in ( [ fusion2 ] ) , hereafter denoted by @xmath72 ,",
    "is then represented in terms of @xmath71 as , @xmath73 the dependence of @xmath55 in the rhs is implicitly indicated by indices of @xmath71 .",
    "we will comment on this representation in terms of a solvable model later .",
    "there is another expression using both @xmath71 s and @xmath74 s .",
    "this form is of practical use in the following generalization . by applying the cramer formula to ( [ single ] )",
    ", we immediately obtain    @xmath75    note that we use the fact that the wronskian is normalized to be unity . the ( 1,1 ) entries in ( [ fusion2 ] )",
    "is then given by @xmath76    one can further generalize the above result .",
    "naturally , the `` fusion '' stokes matrix @xmath77 is defined which relates fss of @xmath43 to @xmath78 .",
    "explicitly , it is given by    @xmath79    for @xmath80 .",
    "we can prove the above using the induction on @xmath81 most easily .",
    "similar formula holds for @xmath82 by replacing all upper indices @xmath83 .",
    "we are now ready to relate an entry in a fusion stokes matrix to the spectral determinant .",
    "hereafter we assume @xmath84 .",
    "it follows from the above argument that @xmath85    @xmath86    @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) stands for the subdominant solution on the positive ( negative ) real axis .",
    "they tend to zero asymptotically in their proper region , being appropriate basis for the eigenfunction .",
    "the eq.([posneg ] ) tells , however , that @xmath89 is combined to _ both _",
    "@xmath87 _ and _ @xmath90 by rotating the complex plane by @xmath91 ,",
    "@xmath92    this is an obstacle in constructing an eigenfunction defined on the whole real axis .",
    "the prescription is to demand that the coefficient of @xmath90 must vanish if @xmath55 is an eigenvalue .",
    "consequently , it is proportional to the spectral determinant .",
    "the coefficient is essentially equal to the ( 2,1 ) component of @xmath93 , and it reads in terms of the original @xmath94 function as    @xmath95    the @xmath3 dependencies are spurious as the entities are products of stokes multipliers which are obviously @xmath3 independent .",
    "we adopt the simplest choice @xmath96 .",
    "the coefficient is now proportional to @xmath97 .",
    "thus we conclude that for an eigenvalue @xmath98 of @xmath58 , @xmath99 must hold .",
    "we can repeat the same argument starting from @xmath100 on the positive real axis .",
    "the above observation may lead to the identification @xmath101    the lower sign signifies the parity : the positive parity means a contribution from symmetric wave function .",
    "the product must be taken over eigenvalues with the corresponding parity .",
    "the total set eigenvalues @xmath102 of @xmath32 consists of two subsets , @xmath102 = @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "we comment on the relation of the present result to an existing solved model .",
    "@xmath72 in ( [ pstransfer ] ) can be represented , utilizing ( [ ident ] ) , as @xmath105 where we safely choose @xmath96 in the rhs .",
    "the above expression has similarity to the dressed vacuum form ( dvf ) of the ( unfused ) transfer matrix for the 3-state ps model with grading @xmath106 .",
    "the latter can be found in eq.(3.1 ) and ( 3.2 ) of @xcite .",
    "the spectral parameter @xmath107 corresponds to energy in the schrdinger operator , precisely , @xmath108 .",
    "the spectral determinants have the following identification to the eigenvalues of baxter s @xmath109 operators , @xmath110 those with positive parity may be identified with the second solutions of baxter s @xmath109 operators .    the scalar factors ( vacuum expectation values ) @xmath111 in @xcite",
    "depend on the choice of the quantum space .",
    "we assume that the present quantum space space gives the simple scalars as in ( [ dvf11 ] ) . in this sense",
    ", @xmath72 exhibits the hidden @xmath1 symmetry behind the present schrdinger operator , just as in the @xmath5 symmetry for @xmath24 problem .",
    "this coincidence can be observed further .",
    "we have checked up to certain value of @xmath81 that the ( 1,1 ) element and the ( 2,2 ) element of @xmath112 coincide with dvf of symmetric fusion transfer matrices @xmath113 and @xmath114 in @xcite , respectively .",
    "the interpretation of the ( 1,2 ) and the ( 2,1 ) element , in terms of fusion transfer matrices , is still an open problem .",
    "one can adopt another description of @xmath115 .",
    "the ( 2,1 ) component of ( [ single ] ) results @xmath116    proceeding as above , we arrive at ,    @xmath117    in the next section , we determine the energy levels by utilizing the above results .",
    "the bethe ansatz equations follow from the pole - free property of @xmath118 on the real @xmath55 axis , @xmath119 to their analysis , we apply the strong machinery in solvable models , the method of nonlinear integral equations .",
    "hereafter we shall confine ourselves to the case @xmath120 where energies are nonnegative .",
    "the simple pattern of energy spectrum permits the following simple - mind choice of auxiliary functions , @xmath121 thus @xmath122 remember that @xmath123 represents the signature of the perturbation while @xmath124 denotes the parity .",
    "in addition , we need some inputs about the asymptotic behaviors from the wkb method . fortunately , they are already available @xcite as the existence of lower power term does not alter them .",
    "@xmath125    there might be several routes to reach nonlinear integral equations among @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "here we choose the quickest way @xcite which fully exploits the fact that zeros of @xmath128 are on the positive real @xmath129 axis .",
    "in addition , we assume that there are no zeros of @xmath130 inside the narrow strip including the positive real axis other than those from zeros of @xmath128 .",
    "apparently we have @xmath131    the above assumption allows the representation of the summation part by an integral over contour @xmath132 which surrounds the positive real axis counterclockwise ,    @xmath133    for convenience , we introduce a variable @xmath129 @xcite by @xmath134 which originates from the matching condition of the wkb result ( [ wkb1 ] ) and the @xmath135 operator analysis @xcite .",
    "let @xmath136 be auxiliary functions defined in ( [ smalla ] ) , ( [ capitala ] ) regarded as functions of @xmath129 .",
    "then eq.([nlie1 ] ) reads , @xmath137 where @xmath138 encircles the whole real axis counterclockwise .    for the reason which will be supplemented , we shall keep @xmath139 in the lower half plane but use @xmath140 in the upper half plane .",
    "this requirement modifies the above expression as @xmath141 where @xmath129 is assumed to possess small negative imaginary part .",
    "the property @xmath142 is employed in the above transformation .",
    "we solve ( [ nlie2 ] ) in terms of @xmath143 to reach the final expression of nlie ,    @xmath144    the kernel functions read @xmath145    few remarks are in order .    1 .   as a consequence of connection rules ,",
    "the integral equations are coupled for auxiliary functions related to the positive and the negative coefficient of @xmath146 .",
    "2 .   on the other hand , equations with different parities are decoupled .",
    "the constants are determined from the consistency by putting @xmath147 .",
    "the @xmath11 dependence is only summarized in these constants .",
    "the first term in the rhs is determined so that we recover the result from the wkb method ( [ wkb1 ] ) by dropping contributions of integrals . clearly , @xmath148 is bounded in the upper - half plane .",
    "this explains our choice of appropriate half planes for auxiliary functions .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath149 are evaluated by @xmath150    more explicitly    @xmath151    we present examples of numerical solutions to ( [ nlie2 ] ) in fig .",
    "5 . the real and the imaginary parts of @xmath152 are depicted for @xmath153 .",
    "we shall check the nonlinear integral equations analytically for limiting cases and numerically .",
    "\\(1 ) @xmath24 case    by putting , @xmath155 the coupled nlie reduce to an identical integral equation .",
    "immediately seen , the result coincides with the nonlinear integral equation in @xcite .",
    "\\(2 ) @xmath156 case    in this case , we have a duality in energy spectra ; @xmath157 coincide with @xmath158 , except for @xmath159 in the latter .",
    "this degeneracy can be easily explained by the following representation of the hamiltonians @xcite , @xmath160 once an eigenvector @xmath161 is found , we can construct the eigenvector for @xmath58 with the same energy by @xmath162 .",
    "only the exception is the @xmath80 case where @xmath163 .",
    "it is interesting that the asymptotic form ( [ asymptotics ] ) from the wkb type argument is exact for all @xmath3 in this case .",
    "right after my talk . ]",
    "the above facts can be also verified from ( [ nlie ] ) .",
    "note that the rhs can be treated as the mod @xmath164 quantity .",
    "then the choice @xmath156 leads to the same coupled equations under identifications @xmath165 , @xmath166 .",
    "this explains the degeneracy of the spectra as it consists both from the negative and the positive parity contributions .",
    "the zero energy case must be treated more separately . by choosing @xmath167",
    ", we find the first term in lhs of ( [ detenergy ] ) is null .",
    "so the first order approximation is @xmath168 .",
    "actually this is exact as we determine the constant terms so that nlie are consistent in @xmath169 .",
    "see remark 3 after ( [ nlie ] ) .",
    "this solution gives the missing energy 0 .",
    "finally we present the preliminary numerical results for @xmath170 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     0.9 cm we are then entitled to apply the strong machinery of the latter developed since baxter s revolution .",
    "there are several open questions .    1 .   in this report",
    "we confine ourselves to the simplest case @xmath171 . for @xmath172 ,",
    "the existence of negative eigenvalues ruins the analyticity assumptions on auxiliary functions .",
    "still , formal expressions of nlie are possible which are similar to excited states tba equations .",
    "the integration contour is , however , not so simple as described here .",
    "this is an apparent drawback in actual numerical investigations .",
    "the clever choice of auxiliary functions may be desired .",
    "2 .   the understanding is lacking on the intrinsic reason why affine symmetry like @xmath173 or @xmath174 comes into play in this simple 1d quantum mechanical model .",
    "this is somewhat related to the above , but is the most intriguing question .",
    "* where is the yang - baxter equation in the 1d schrdinger operator problem?*. once this is known , the fusion hierarchy , useful in the present study , is a mere corollary of it .",
    "we hope to answer these in the future publication .",
