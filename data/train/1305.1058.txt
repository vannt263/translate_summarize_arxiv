    "due to its remarkable success on molecular systems , b3lyp has been the workhorse density functional for molecular chemistry computations for almost 20 years [ s11 , s12 ] . for example",

    "b3lyp has also been found to predict excellent band gaps for carbon nanotubes and binary and ternary semiconductors relevant to photovoltaics and thermoelectrics [ s15 , s16 ] .",
    "the essential difference between b3lyp and all pure density functionals is that 20% exact hartree - fock ( hf ) exchange is included .",
    "b3lyp is called a hybrid functional because it includes exact hf exchange .",
    "the hf exchange removes some of the self - coulomb repulsion of an electron with itself found in pure dft functionals .",
    "a modern viewpoint of the reason for the success of hybrid functionals is that inclusion of some exact hartree - fock exchange compensates the error for fractional charges that occur in lda , pbe , and other pure density functionals [ s17 ] .",
    "the downside to using hybrid functionals is they are computationally more expensive than pure density functionals .",

    "the d@xmath50 cu impurity is not a charged impurity .",

    "since the impurity scattering cross section ( and hence the scattering length ) scales as the square of the difference in the potential between these two types of cu atoms , the scattering can be up to two orders of magnitude smaller than a typical impurity , as we show below .",
