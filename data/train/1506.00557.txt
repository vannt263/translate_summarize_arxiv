    "the question whether the two - baryon system possesses more eigenstates than just the isoscalar deuteron groundstate and the isovector virtual @xmath7 state ( known from the nn final state interaction ) awaits an answer since decades .",
    "this fundamental question has been connected to the question about six - quark systems first in 1964 , when dyson and xuong @xcite correlated this topic with symmetry breaking of su(6 )  just shortly after gell - mann s famous publication @xcite of the quark model . however , this topic did not find overwhelming attention until 1977 , when jaffe predicted the so - called h dibaryon @xcite , a bound @xmath8 system , based on quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "it was this paper , which initiated a real dibaryon rush with a copious number of theoretical calculations and an even greater number of dibaryon searches resulting in a vast number of experimental claims  but finally none survived careful experimental investigations . for a review see , _",
    "e.g. _ ref .",
    "@xcite .    reasons for this striking failure of previous dibaryon searches may be sought , at least party , in the insufficient quality of data based either on low - statistics bubble - chamber or inclusive measurements performed mainly with single - arm detectors @xcite .",
    "recently the question about dibaryons received renewed interest after it had been realized that there exist more complex quark configurations than just the familiar @xmath9 and @xmath10 systems  in favor also of hidden color aspects @xcite .",
    "since two - pion production was hardly investigated , but had the potential to contain unusual phenomena , a systematic study of this process was started in the nineties at the celsius storage ring , where by the begin of the new millennium the wasa detector with close - to @xmath11 angular coverage went into operation in combination with a hydrogen / deuterium pellet target @xcite .",
    "this provided the possibility to measure meson production in @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 collisions for the first time exclusively and kinematically completely  even with up to six overconstraints .",
    "in addition the high - quality beam in combination with the pellet target ensured a low background situation .",
    "that way such measurements delivered data of unprecedented quality .    in 2005",
    "the wasa detector was moved to the cosy ring taking advantage of the still much superior beam quality and intensity there @xcite .",
    "this allowed to move the studies from @xmath12 induced to @xmath15 induced reactions by measuring the quasifree scattering process with high accuracy over a wide energy region .",
    "additionally , two - pion production was also studied at cosy with polarized beam utilizing the tof detector , which also covered practically the full solid angle @xcite .    as a result of these kinematically complete and exclusive two - pion production measurements at celsius and subsequently at cosy it was shown that all @xmath12 induced , _",
    "i.e. _ all isovector channels , behave as expected from conventional @xmath0-channel excitation of roper , @xmath2 ( mutual excitation of the colliding nucleons into their first excited state @xmath16 ) and @xmath17 resonances @xcite .",
    "the situation changes strikingly in @xmath15 initiated two - pion production .",
    "especially the purely isoscalar @xmath18 reaction , for which the cross section from the conventional processes was expected to be particularly small and for which also no data existed so far , exhibits a striking narrow lorentzian structure in the total cross section .",
    "first indications of that were observed at celsius @xcite .",
    "later - on this resonance structure was measured in detail at cosy with much improved statistics and accuracy @xcite leading to m@xmath19 2370 mev and @xmath20 70 mev for mass and width .",
    "the latter is more than three times smaller than expected from a conventional @xmath2 excitation via the @xmath0-channel meson exchange .",
    "nevertheless the dalitz plot clearly shows that this resonance structure decays predominantly via a @xmath2 intermediate state , though the resonance mass is about 80 mev below the nominal mass @xmath21 of the @xmath22 system .",
    "the angular distributions measured for this reaction determine the spin - parity of this structure to be @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "subsequent measurements of all three reactions leading to the double - pionic fusion to the deuteron uniquely determined this structure as being of isoscalar nature . fig . 1 , left , shows the experimental decomposition of the isospin - mixed @xmath24 reaction ( red symbols ) into its isoscalar ( blue ) and isovector ( black ) components corresponding to the @xmath25 and @xmath26 channels , respectively @xcite .",
    "note that the latter does not show the resonance structure .    if this structure , indeed , represents a genuine @xmath6-channel resonance , it has to show up also in the entrance channel , though its effect in @xmath27 scattering is expected to be very small @xcite .",
    "for such an investigation the @xmath27 analyzing power is the most promising observable .",
    "since it consists only of partial - wave interference terms , it is particularly sensitive to small contributions .",
    "hence , in the absence of data from previous experiments , polarized @xmath28 scattering measurements were conducted with wasa at cosy @xcite .",
    "the resulting data show a resonance structure in the energy dependence ",
    "right at the expected position . at the right - hand side of fig",
    "1 , the results are depicted for a center - of - mass scattering angle near 90@xmath29 , where the effect of a @xmath23 resonance is largest .",
    "inclusion of the wasa data in the said data base and its subsequent partial - wave analysis , indeed , produces a pole in the coupled @xmath30 partial waves at @xmath31 mev  in agreement with the resonance hypothesis based on the double - pionic fusion results @xcite and denoted now accordingly @xmath32 ,     ( red ) and its isospin decomposition @xcite into isoscalar part  corresponding to @xmath33 ( blue )  and isovector part  corresponding to @xmath34 ( black )  on the center - of - mass energy @xmath35 .",

    "@xcite.,title=\"fig:\",width=185 ]    in addition to its decay into fusion channels this resonance should decay also into all isospin allowed non - fusion two - pion production channels , _",
    "i.e. _ the channels @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 . again , for lack of appropriate data , the first two channels were studied with wasa at cosy in the energy region of interest .",
    "the results ( blue solid dots ) for the total cross sections are shown in fig .  2 together with data from previous experiments ( open symbols ) @xcite .",
    "the experiments are again consistent with the appearance of the @xmath38 resonance as expected from isospin relations .",
    "note that the resonance effect appears here not as pronounced , since it sits on the steep slope of a strongly rising four - body phase - space from conventional processes .    for the @xmath41 channel there exist as of yet solely bubble - chamber data @xcite . within their very limited precision",
    "they agree reasonably well with our calculation for this channel , as depicted in fig .",
    "2 , right .",
    "this calculation uses the same conventional background description as used for the other @xmath42 channels . for the resonance strength it utilizes the prediction of albaladejo and oset @xcite and includes also the small @xmath43 channel configuration , not taken into account in ref .",
    "@xcite , but observed in the @xmath39 channel ( fig .  23 , left ) .",
    "since the hades collaboration has performed measurements for this channel in the energy region of interest , high - quality data may soon get available .",
    "a dibaryon state with @xmath1 having an asymptotic @xmath2 configuration was already predicted by dyson and xuong @xcite and even the predicted mass was close to the one observed now .",
    "later on goldman _",
    "_ pointed out the unique features of such an state based on its particular symmetries due to its quantum numbers and called it the `` inevitable dibaryon '' @xcite .",
    "recent state - of - the - art three - body @xcite and quark - model @xcite calculations obtain this resonance at about the right mass and partly also reproduce its width .",
    "for the first time a genuine dibaryon resonance has been identified by observing it in various decay channels  in particular also in the elastic @xmath15 channel .",
    "this experimental success was only possible by kinematically complete ( even overdetermined ) and exclusive measurements using the best suitable equipment consisting of high - precision storage - ring beams , pellet target and a hermetic detector covering the full reaction phase - space .",
