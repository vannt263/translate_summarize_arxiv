    "non - thermal electron acceleration is believed to be a universal feature of non - relativistic collisionless shocks both in space plasma and astrophysical environments . in the earth",
    "s bow shock , for example , electrons accelerated up to few tens of kev are usually observed in quasi - perpendicular regions , i.e , where the angle between the upstream magnetic field and the shock normal is @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "also , radio and x - ray observations of supernova remnants ( snrs ) show synchrotron radiation produced by relativistic , non - thermal electrons accelerated in their forward shocks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "despite its ubiquity , the actual mechanism for shock acceleration of electrons is still a mystery . the diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa )",
    "mechanism is the most accepted theory for particle acceleration in shocks @xcite .",
    "this theory assumes that particles are scattered by mhd turbulence both in the upstream and downstream regions of the shock . under these conditions , particles move diffusively in the shock vicinity , gaining energy through many crossings of the shock .",
    "however , in order to be able to cross the shock many times , the particles need to have larmor radii that are larger than the shock width , which is controlled by the typical ion larmor radius .",
    "this is the still unresolved  injection problem \" of the dsa theory , which is particularly stringent for electrons due to their small larmor radii .",
    "several methods have been applied to studying electron acceleration in non - relativistic shocks .",
    "one approach , typically used in the context of low alfvnic mach number ( @xmath9 ) shocks , uses test particle electrons moving in electromagnetic fields pre - determined from hybrid simulations ( where ions are modeled as kinetic particles and electrons as a massless fluid ) .",
    "recently , @xcite showed that electrons can be energized due to repeated shock crossings as they move along pre - existing , large - scale magnetic fluctuations in perpendicular shocks .",
    "also , @xcite used the same method to show that shock  ripples , \" which are fluctuations on the surface of quasi - perpendicular shocks , can provide the scattering necessary for efficient electron acceleration .",
    "although in principle these mechanisms may contribute significant electron energization in non - relativistic shocks , they still require a population of electrons that are somehow injected upstream with energies significantly above thermal .",
    "understanding the origin of these particles requires self - consistent kinetic calculations based on particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations .",
    "pic simulations have been used by several authors to study the electron acceleration problem in non - relativistic shocks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for instance , using two - dimensional pic simulations , @xcite showed that efficient electron acceleration ( with spectral index @xmath10 2 - 2.5 ) can happen in a perpendicular , @xmath11 shock due to  shock surfing \" of electrons on electrostatic waves from buneman instability excited at the leading edge of the shock foot .",
    "these simulations were done for relatively low mass ratios ( @xmath12 ) and for a particular geometry of the magnetic field ( strictly out of the plane of the simulation ) .",
    "the dependence of this mechanism on different shock parameters needs to be clarified , and in fact , in this work we find that this mechanism is not very efficient at realistic mass ratios . also , using two - dimensional pic simulations @xcite showed that , for @xmath13 shocks , pre - acceleration in buneman waves can be complemented by further energization due to scattering at the shock ripples , supporting the picture laid out by @xcite .",
    "the energy spectrum of the electrons in this case , however , does not correspond to a power law tail , but is rather described by two maxwellian distributions at different temperatures .",
    "one of the main difficulties of pic studies is that using realistic physical parameters is computationally expensive , so unrealistic approximations have to be made .",
    "for instance , simultaneously capturing the dynamics of electrons and ions requires resolving time scales as short as the inverse of the plasma frequency of electrons , @xmath14 , and as long as the inverse of the cyclotron frequency of ions , @xmath15 ( with @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the speed of light , @xmath19 is the magnitude of the magnetic field , and @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are the density , mass , and electric charge of the @xmath23 species ) .",
    "given that @xmath24 , where @xmath25 @xmath26 corresponds to the alfvn velocity of the plasma , the computing time in pic simulations is usually reduced by using artificial mass ratios @xmath27 and/or relatively large values of @xmath28 .",
    "also , these studies are usually made using one- and two - dimensional simulations .",
    "although much of the relevant physics can still be revealed using these approximations , a complete understanding of the role played by the chosen parameters is crucial before any extrapolation to realistic setups is made .",
    "thus , in this work we present a systematic exploration of the space of shock parameters , paying special attention to the role of artificial mass ratios @xmath4 on the possible electron energization .",
    "the effect of using a reduced ion to electron mass ratio @xmath4 has already been highlighted by previous pic studies of quasi - perpendicular shock structure @xcite .",
    "these works have shown that excessively small @xmath4 may suppress the appearance of oblique whistler waves in the foot of low @xmath9 shocks , which would lead to periodic shock reformation .    in terms of electron energization",
    ", the works of @xcite also show that whistler waves can lead to significant electron heating in the foot of the shocks , but the investigation of their possible role in non - thermal electron injection remains to be realized .",
    "however , both our simulations and the recent work by @xcite show neither whistler excitation nor significant electron acceleration in such shocks , raising questions about the consistency of the assumptions that went into the theory . ] .",
    "in this work we study the injection of non - thermal electrons in quasi - perpendicular shocks , using two- and three - dimensional pic simulations .",
    "we systematically test different regimes for the shock velocity , @xmath2 , the plasma magnetization ( quantified in @xmath9 ) , the ion to electron mass ratio @xmath4 , and the angle between the shock normal and the ambient magnetic field , @xmath3 .",
    "we show that the presence of oblique whistler waves in the shock foot does lead to significant electron acceleration with spectral index @xmath29 .",
    "this acceleration appears to prefer small values of the @xmath30 ratio , and requires @xmath31 .",
    "these two conditions likely explain why this effect was not seen by previous pic studies of this problem , where strictly perpendicular shocks with fairly low mass ratios were used .",
    "for the realistic value @xmath32 , this acceleration would require low mach numbers , @xmath6 , in order to explain the electron injection fraction inferred from broadband observations of snrs .",
    "thus , if this mechanism happens to be the only possible solution for electron injection into the dsa process in snr shocks , the @xmath6 condition would imply strong amplification of the upstream magnetic field of these shocks .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "[ sec : setup ] we explain the numerical setup of our simulations . in  [ sec : injection ] , we describe the mechanism that brings electrons to non - thermal energies , by analyzing the evolution of the accelerated particles in one of our simulations . in  [ sec : parameters ] , we explore different shock parameters , and determine the regimes where electrons acceleration occurs .",
    "our final discussion and conclusions are presented in  [",
    "sec : disconclu ] .",
    "we use the electromagnetic pic code tristan - mp @xcite in two and three dimensions .",
    "a shock wave is produced by reflecting a cold high - speed electron - ion plasma off a conducting wall .",
    "the shock forms due to the interaction between the incoming and reflected beams and propagates away from the wall along the @xmath33direction .",
    "the incoming plasma carries a uniform magnetic field , @xmath34 , forming an angle @xmath3 with the shock normal ( which coincides with the @xmath33axis ) .",
    "the shocked plasma stays at rest with respect to the box , so the simulation is done in the downstream frame . in two dimensions the simulation box consists of a rectangle in the @xmath35 plane with periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath36direction .",
    "the incoming plasma is injected through a  moving injector \" , which recedes from the wall in the @xmath33direction at the speed of light .",
    "the simulation box is expanded in the @xmath37direction as the injector approaches the right boundary . this way the memory and computing time are saved , while following the evolution of all the upstream regions that are causally connected with the shock .",
    "further numerical optimization can be achieved by allowing the moving injector to periodically jump backward ( i.e. , in the @xmath38direction ) , resetting the fields to its right ( see * ? ? ?",
    "since the shock travels much slower than the speed of light , without a jumping injector ( i.e. , with the injector only moving at @xmath18 ) the upstream region would comprise most of the simulation domain .",
    "however , since we expect the electron acceleration to occur on scales close to the shock foot ( i.e. , at a distance comparable to the typical larmor radius of ions , @xmath39 ) , keeping an upstream size of a few shock foot lengths should be enough to capture the relevant acceleration physics .",
    "thus , in our simulations the moving injector jumps backward every 2000 time steps , with the first jump happening after 4000 - 12000 time steps ( depending on the length of the shock foot ) .",
    "the injector jumps backward a distance such that its average velocity is close to the shock speed .",
    "this method also helps to reduce particle heating by the numerical cold beam instability , which can happen after a long distance propagation of the cold plasma over the numerical grid .",
    "we ran a series of two- and three - dimensional simulations to explore different shock regimes .",
    "the run parameters are summarized in tables [ table:2d ] , [ table:3d ] , and [ table:2dperp ] .",
    "the numerical value of the speed of light is set to @xmath40 cells / time step in all the runs .",
    "in the two - dimensional runs presented in the main part of the paper , @xmath34 is always in the plane of the simulation ( @xmath35 plane ) .",
    "this condition is changed in appendix [ sec : appendix ] , where the case of @xmath34 quasi - perpendicular to the simulation plane is considered .",
    "in this section we disentangle the process that gives rise to the electron energization , focusing on one of our shock simulations where significant acceleration is observed .",
    "we use the two - dimensional run 2d-3 , with @xmath41 ( as seen from the upstream medium ) , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 ( the other parameters are specified in table [ table:2d ] ) .",
    "first we will describe the basic features of the shock , and then we will focus on the process of electron energization .      ) at @xmath46 ( @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is defined in the upstream ) , whose basic parameters are @xmath49 , @xmath44 , @xmath43 , and @xmath45 .",
    "the phase space distribution functions of the ions , @xmath50 , on the @xmath51 and @xmath52 planes are shown in panels @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding phase space distribution functions for the electrons , @xmath55 , are depicted in panels @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "the distribution functions are normalized by their maximum value .",
    "panels @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 show the magnetic field components along the @xmath33 and @xmath61 axes , and the ion density , respectively .",
    "panel @xmath62 shows the one - dimensional ion density profile averaged on the @xmath63 axis.,width=321 ]    quasi - perpendicular shocks are characterized by the presence of the so - called shock foot .",
    "the foot is defined by the existence of a beam of ions reflected by the shock , whose bulk velocity in the upstream frame is close to @xmath2 and has comparable @xmath64 and @xmath65 components .",
    "the foot region can be seen in panels @xmath53 and @xmath54 of figure [ fig : phaspace ] ( between @xmath66 and 470 @xmath67 ) , which depicts the phase space distribution functions of the ions .",
    "this region covers a distance comparable to the ion larmor radius , @xmath39 ( calculated with the upstream magnetic field @xmath68 ) , and is located right in front of the shock density jump or  ramp \" , as shown in panel @xmath62 of the same figure .",
    "an important feature of the shock foot is the presence of oblique electromagnetic waves that grow on scales of @xmath69 @xmath67 , forming an angle of @xmath70 with the shock normal .",
    "these waves can be seen in panels @xmath71 of figure [ fig : phaspace ] ( between @xmath66 and 470 @xmath67 ) , which show the magnetic field along the @xmath33direction , @xmath72 , the magnetic field along the @xmath61direction , @xmath73 , and the ion density , @xmath74 , respectively .",
    "the oblique modes have a right - handed circular polarization , and their phase velocity is comparable to the speed of the shock .",
    "all these features allow them to be identified as electron whistler waves propagating obliquely with respect to the background magnetic field .",
    "the whistler waves have been studied in the context of shock structure evolution , using one- , two- , and three - dimensional pic simulations , as well as hybrid codes .",
    "the two - dimensional studies show that whistler waves can play an important role by suppressing the self - reformation of perpendicular and quasi - perpendicular shocks @xcite .",
    "this effect , however , would be less important in the fully three - dimensional geometry , as shown by a recent pic study @xcite .",
    "the exact generation mechanism of these whistlers is still subject to debate .",
    "one candidate mechanism is the so - called modified two - stream instability ( mtsi ) , driven by the relative cross - field velocity between the electrons and the ions in the foot of the shocks @xcite . since in quasi - perpendicular shocks a significant fraction of the ions",
    "are reflected into the upstream , the mtsi can be driven by the relative motion between electrons and either the incoming or reflected ions .",
    "these two possibilities are usually referred to as mtsi1 and mtsi2 , respectively .",
    "the analytic dispersion relation calculations show that the mtsi1 and mtsi2 will grow if @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively , where @xmath77 is the angle between the magnetic field and the wave vector of the waves , and @xmath78 is the fraction of reflected ions , with typical values of @xmath79 @xcite . independently of which of these two varieties of the mtsi is more dominant , these conditions show that the smaller is the ratio @xmath30 the larger is the range of @xmath77 where the excitation of whistler waves in the foot of shocks would be possible .",
    "another possibility for whistler generation is that these waves can be an intrinsic component of oblique quasi - perpendicular shocks .",
    "indeed , @xcite proposed an analytical model for the structure of these shocks where the shock ramp is treated as a nonlinear whistler wave .",
    "this model shows that if @xmath80 , where @xmath3 is the angle between the shock normal and the upstream magnetic field , @xmath34 , the shock precursor would contain a stationary whistler wave train .",
    "if @xmath81 is exceeded , these whistler waves would become non - linear and would be rather confined to the shock ramp .",
    "but if @xmath82 a stationary solution for the shock structure would no longer be possible , which would set the condition for shock reformation . in particular for run 2d-3 ( @xmath83 and @xmath45 ) the condition for the whistler generation due to the mtsi ( in any of its two varieties ) appears to be less stringent than for the model proposed by @xcite .",
    "this is in general the case for the simulations presented in this paper .",
    "but , even for runs where @xmath84 , the growth of whistler waves in the foot of quasi - perpendicular shocks appears to be favored for small values of the @xmath30 ratio .      .",
    "the spectra are measured at the @xmath85 , and 460 positions , shown in black , red , green , and blue lines , respectively .",
    "these positions are also marked by vertical lines in panel @xmath62 of figure [ fig : phaspace ] , whose colors match the ones used for the corresponding spectra.,width=302 ]    the phase space distribution functions for electrons is depicted in panels @xmath56 and @xmath57 of figure [ fig : phaspace ] .",
    "although the electrons are mainly heated at the shock , significant electron energization also occurs in the foot region .",
    "this is seen from the electron spectra shown in figure [ fig : spectpos ] , which are measured at several positions in the shock region .",
    "the positions are marked by the vertical lines in figure [ fig : phaspace]h , with colors matching the ones of the corresponding spectra in figure [ fig : spectpos ] .",
    "we see that the two energy distributions measured in the downstream ( red and black lines ) show a high - energy power law tail with spectral index @xmath86 ( for comparison a maxwellian distribution corresponding to the downstream electron temperature is shown in black dotted line ) .",
    "the two spectra measured in the foot and the beginning of the ramp ( blue and green lines , respectively ) do not show a power law tail , but a bump in the high energy part of the distribution .",
    "this high energy bump is also observed further upstream , showing that some accelerated electrons also outrun the shock as they move along the upstream magnetic field .",
    "the maximum lorentz factor of the electrons ( @xmath87 ) is consistent with the electron larmor radii being comparable to that of the ions , i.e. , @xmath88 . also , two downstream ion spectra , measured at the locations of the vertical black and red lines in panel @xmath62 of figure [ fig : phaspace ] , are depicted by dashed lines .",
    "these spectra show an incomplete ion thermalization , and essentially no ion acceleration , with only a small , exponentially decreasing bump at energies a few times above thermal .",
    "notice that the downstream electron temperature is close to the mean kinetic energy of the ions ( for @xmath89 ) , implying energy equilibration between both species .",
    "finally , the spectra depicted in figure [ fig : spectpos ] are fully evolved , in the sense that they do not show significant variations in time",
    ". this will be the case in all the simulations shown in this paper after a time of @xmath90 .      in this section",
    "we illustrate the physics of the electron acceleration process by focusing on the evolution of a typical non - thermal electron . in the three panels of figure [ fig : elenevol1 ]",
    "we plot the energy of the electron , represented by the solid , black line . in order to identify the source of the energy gain",
    ", we also plot the accumulated energy gain , @xmath91 , due to the work done by the electric field along the @xmath23 axis ( red , green , and blue lines represent @xmath92 , @xmath63 , and @xmath65 , respectively ) .",

    "the field is normalized in terms of @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the speed at which the upstream plasma is injected , as seen from the downstream medium ( for run 2d-3 , @xmath101 ) . on top of each panel ,",
    "the trajectory of an accelerated electron is tracked by the black line , with the yellow and red circles marking the initial and final time of each trajectory .",
    "the black circle , marks the time of each field snapshot.,width=321 ]     but for the ion density , @xmath74 .",
    "the density is normalized in terms of the upstream ion density , @xmath102 .",
    "the arrows represent the orientation of the magnetic field on the @xmath35 plane.,width=321 ]    this energy gain is calculated as @xmath103 , where @xmath104 and @xmath105 correspond to the electron velocity and electric field along the @xmath23 axis , respectively .",
    "since these cumulative energies are shown on the logarithmic scale , we plot their absolute values , and use dotted lines when they correspond to negative quantities . in each panel",
    "we also highlight a small time interval , whose starting and final points are marked by yellow and red circles , respectively .",
    "the particle trajectories corresponding to each of these intervals are shown on top of figures [ fig : elecaccel1 ] and [ fig : elecaccel2 ] by a solid , black line .",
    "the black circle on top of the highlighted intervals marks the time of each field snapshot .",
    "the initial increase in the electron energy happens in the first highlighted interval , shown in figure [ fig : elenevol1]@xmath106 , with the particle location depicted in figures [ fig : elecaccel1]@xmath106 and [ fig : elecaccel2]@xmath106 .",
    "we can see that this initial energization happens in the shock foot as the particle moves through the region of amplified whistler waves .",
    "the energy gain is initially due to increase in @xmath107 , with @xmath108 contributing most of the energy gain after @xmath109 .",
    "although before the initial energy growth ( the one dominated by @xmath107 ) @xmath108 has already increased significantly , its contribution to the total energy of the electron is almost exactly compensated by a decrease in @xmath110 ( see rising dotted blue and solid red lines between @xmath111 and 1920 in figure [ fig : elenevol1]@xmath106 ) .",
    "indeed , the particle motion until this point was dominated by the @xmath112 drift , which does not allow any net work to be done by the electric field .",
    "however , as soon as electric field fluctuations on scales comparable to the electron larmor radius appear , this almost perfect cancellation stops , and a net energy gain becomes possible . since the @xmath36axis is quasi - parallel to the initial field @xmath34 , the initial energization due to @xmath113 already suggests an important feature of the whistlers waves : their electric field has a non - negligible component along the magnetic field direction .",
    "this parallel electric field component can be explained by the obliquity of the waves with respect to the initial magnetic field , which makes the projection of whistler electric field on @xmath34 have a magnitude @xmath114 .",
    "the energy gain due to the parallel electric field can be verified from figure [ fig : elenevol2 ] , where we have plotted in red and green the energy gain due to the electric field perpendicular and parallel to @xmath94 ( @xmath95 and @xmath96 , respectively ) .",
    "indeed , we can see that @xmath96 is what dominates the initial energy gain of the electron , confirming that the presence of the electric field parallel to the magnetic field is the essential component in the initial electron energization .",
    "this feature makes this process fundamentally different from fast fermi acceleration where the shock acts as a magnetic mirror , energizing the electrons due to the electric field component perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "finally , we note that this initial energization is described in the frame where the downstream plasma is at rest ( usually called normal incidence frame ) .",
    "the picture , however , should be essentially the same if described from any other frame like , for instance , the de hoffman - teller frame .",
    "in particular , the initial energization will continue to be dominated by the electric field component parallel to the magnetic field .",
    "this is due to the relativistic invariance of @xmath115 , which would make @xmath116 a nearly invariant quantity under any non - relativistic frame transformation . after the initial energization driven by the whistlers ,",
    "the acceleration due to @xmath117 ( the convective electric field ) starts to play a more relevant role , as can be seen from figure [ fig : elenevol1]@xmath118 .",
    "we see that in the highlighted interval ( marked by the two vertical , dashed lines ) the energy increase is driven by a jump both in @xmath110 and @xmath107 . in figures [ fig : elecaccel1]@xmath118 and [ fig : elecaccel2]@xmath118 we can see that during these energy increases the electron moves mainly along the @xmath119direction , and stays close to the shock ramp .",
    "the relevance of the energy gain due to @xmath117 is more obvious at later times , when the electron larmor radius has become comparable to a sizable fraction of the foot length .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : elenevol1]@xmath18 , most of the energy is gained due to an increase in @xmath110 .",
    "the particle trajectory corresponding to the marked interval ( between the two vertical , dashed lines ) is plotted in figures [ fig : elecaccel1]@xmath18 and [ fig : elecaccel2]@xmath18 .",
    "we can see that , as it moves ( mainly along the @xmath119direction ) , the particle jumps a couple of times from the upstream to the downstream and vice versa , gaining energy in a way similar to shock drift acceleration .",
    "apart from dominating the initial electron energization , the energy gain along the magnetic field , @xmath96 , also increases the particle s ability to move along the magnetic field lines .",
    "this is important because if an electron velocity along @xmath34 becomes larger than @xmath120 , it will be possible for the particle to move along the @xmath121direction faster than the shock .",
    "when this happens , the electron will be able to escape upstream , increasing its chances to be further scattered by the whistlers waves .",
    "this qualitative picture already shows that having @xmath31 is an important component in the acceleration process .",
    "this angle dependence of the acceleration is confirmed in the following section where the importance of the shock parameters : @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath2 , and @xmath9 for electron acceleration is studied . finally , it is important to point out that the evolution of thermal electrons is fundamentally different to the one of the non - thermal particles , which is what we described in this section .",
    "thermal electrons gain some energy due to a random combination of the parallel and perpendicular electric field mainly in the ramp and shock transition region , and then are rapidly incorporated into the downstream medium .",
    "in this section , we seek to determine the physical conditions under which the electron acceleration due to whistler waves happens . to do this , we analyze the acceleration behavior by varying different shock parameters one by one .",

    "the rest of the parameters are the same as for simulation 2d-3 in table [ table:2d ] .",
    "we can see that the hardest spectrum is reached for @xmath123 ( red line ) , with @xmath124 while the softest spectrum is obtained for the @xmath125 case ( purple line ) , which corresponds to a maxwellian distribution with a small increase in the number of particles at energies a few times above thermal .",
    "this result confirms the picture suggested in  [ sec : physaccel ] , in which the electron energization strongly depends on the ability of these particles to propagate in front of the shock as they slide along the magnetic field lines .",
    "this condition implies that the most accelerated particles must move preferentially along the @xmath119axis .",
    "this is in fact what we noticed when tracking the trajectory of the accelerated electron analyzed in ",
    "[ sec : physaccel ] , which represents the typical behavior of the most energetic particles in our runs . for @xmath126 the softer spectra can be explained by the less efficient confinement of the particles to the shock vicinity .",
    "a quasi - perpendicular configuration keeps the electrons close to the shock , not allowing them to easily escape upstream . from that perspective",
    ", it is reasonable to think that the most efficient acceleration will happen when @xmath127 is just large enough to allow the electrons to move at @xmath2 in the @xmath121 direction , with decreasing efficiency for larger values of @xmath127 .      ,",

    "this dependence of the acceleration on the shock parameters can be explained in terms of two requirements : @xmath176 the shock needs to be able to excite whistler waves in the foot , which translates into the condition @xmath7 , and @xmath177 the accelerated electrons need to stay in the shock foot for a time long enough to increase their chances of being scattered by the whistler waves .",

    "it is important to emphasize that in this paper we have concentrated only on the injection part of the acceleration process .",

    "thus , given that the acceleration of electrons and ions would require different magnetic orientations , in principle , the acceleration of these two species would not be possible in the same regions of the shocks .",

    "this is actually what has been found by numerical studies of the cr streaming instabilities , which are characterized by very turbulent magnetic configurations in their non - linear state @xcite .",
    "also , these instabilities would produce magnetic field fluctuations on scales comparable to the larmor radii of the crs , @xmath212 .",
    "therefore , given that the electron injection mechanism presented here operates on length scales comparable to a few @xmath213 ( which is much smaller than @xmath212 ) , it is plausible that electron acceleration can happen locally , in regions where @xmath94 is quasi - perpendicular to the shock normal .",
    "the likely global picture of the shock acceleration process then unfolds as follows . on large scales upstream of the efficiently accelerating shock ,",
    "the magnetic field is likely quasi - parallel to the shock normal .",

    "escaping cosmic rays amplify and reorient the upstream magnetic field closer to the shock via current - driven instabilities .",
    "the resulting magnetic turbulence advected to the shock will be roughly isotropic , with regions of quasi - perpendicular magnetic field intermittently crossing the shock .",

    "once pre - accelerated , the electrons will join the ions in dsa on scales larger than the shock foot in the turbulence that is driven by the cosmic rays .",
    "this speculative picture underscores the interdependence of electron and ion acceleration , as without cosmic rays the amplification and reorientation of magnetic field needed for electron injection would be hard to achieve .",
    "observationally , this scenario is consistent with the large scale magnetic field in sn1006 pointing along the axis that connects the  polar caps \" of bright non - thermal emission ( ballet 2006 ) .",
    "also , the degree of linear polarization should be smaller in snr rims with strong synchrotron emission , as we expect the field direction near the shock to be randomized by the amplified turbulence @xcite .",
    "on larger scales , the radial magnetic fields inferred from radio polarization measurements of synchrotron - emitting regions of snr shocks are also consistent with our model ( dickel et al .",
    "1991 , delaney et al .",
    "the results presented in this paper correspond to only a partial exploration of the space of shock parameters . studying this problem using realistic mass ratios is computationally expensive , so testing all the possible combinations of parameters of interest is complicated and will require further work .",
    "for instance , one of our basic assumptions is that the angle @xmath3 at which the acceleration is maximized has a weak dependence on the ion to electron mass ratio .",
    "we believe that this assumption needs to be investigated by performing a more complete exploration of the acceleration efficiency dependence on @xmath3 and @xmath4 . in a similar way",
    ", the dependence of the acceleration efficiency on the shock velocity @xmath2 requires further study .",
    "we found that , when passing from @xmath147 to 0.42 , the slope of the power law part of the electron spectra for the mass ratios @xmath12 , 100 , and 400 does not change significantly .",
    "however , this result was obtained only in the case of @xmath146 and @xmath44 .",
    "we think that it would be interesting to confirm this weak velocity dependence by performing a thorough exploration of the shock parameter space at lower velocities .",
    "finally , comparing two - dimensional simulations with analogous three - dimensional runs where the typical whistler length scale ( @xmath133 ) is resolved in the third dimension would also be useful to confirm our results and to enquire about possible additional three - dimensional effects .",
    "although we do not expect the qualitative picture presented here to change significantly , we believe that these studies would give us more accuracy in our estimates of the electron injection efficiencies as a function of the shock parameters . with these caveats in mind , in this paper we have identified a new possible mechanism for electron injection into the dsa process in non - relativistic shocks .",
    "the obtained spectra are consistent with in - situ measurements of electron energy distributions at the earth s bow shock .",
    "also , our results would explain the observed electron acceleration in snr shocks , implying very large upstream magnetic field amplification in these environments .",
    "thus , if this mechanism proves to be the only possible solution for electron injection in non - relativistic blast waves , it would reinforce the inferred strong connection between particle acceleration and magnetic field amplification in snr shocks .",

    "this acceleration is driven by the presence of electrostatic waves , produced by the buneman instability @xcite , in the foot of quasi - perpendicular shocks .",
    "the buneman waves grow in the leading edge of the foot due to the relative velocity between the upstream electrons and the shock - reflected ions , and have a typical scale comparable to @xmath134 .",
    "the small length scale of these waves , which can be comparable or even smaller than the electron larmor radii , makes the buneman waves a potentially important means for electron scattering and energization in the foot of quasi - perpendicular shocks . as the upstream electrons encounter these waves , they gain energy due to the work performed by the fluctuating electric field , combined with the convective field of the upstream plasma .",
    "the wave vector of the fastest growing mode is parallel to the velocity of the beam of returning ions , so these waves are best studied either by three - dimensional simulations or by two - dimensional runs where the magnetic field is quasi - perpendicular to the simulation plane , so that the gyrational motion of the ions is resolved on the plane plane . ]",
    "using a two - dimensional simulation with shock parameters @xmath220 ( @xmath221 ) , @xmath150 , @xmath222 ( with @xmath34 perpendicular to the simulation plane ) , and @xmath12 , @xcite showed that an electron spectrum with index @xmath223 2 - 2.5 can be produced in the shock transition region due to this mechanism . in this appendix",
    "we show , however , that the importance of this shock surfing acceleration decreases as the mass ratio increases to more realistic values . as an example , let us compare the downstream spectra of three simulations with the same shock parameters @xmath101 ( @xmath224 ) , @xmath44 , @xmath146 ( and the angle between @xmath34 and @xmath225 equal to @xmath226 ) , but different mass ratios : @xmath227 , and 400 ( the rest of the parameters are specified in table [ table:2dperp ] ) . figure [ fig : compmasspect ] shows the spectra at @xmath47 measured in the downstream medium .",
    "although in all three cases a non - thermal component can be seen , the maximum energy reached by the electrons is about the same ( @xmath228 ) , despite the factor of 16 difference in the used mass ratios . in particular , in the @xmath43 case ,",
    "the closeness between the peak of the thermal part of the distribution and the maximum energy of the accelerated particles reduces significantly the relative fraction of non - thermal particles compared with @xmath12 and 100 cases .",
    "also , notice that in these two - dimensional simulations the acceleration due to whistler waves gets suppressed .",
    "this is because these simulations only allow the wave vector of the whistlers to be quasi - perpendicular to the magnetic field , inhibiting their growth and their effect on the electron energization . in terms of the evolution of the buneman waves",
    ", we also observe a decrease in their relative amplitude .",
    "this can be seen from figure [ fig : massbuneman ] , where the electric field along the @xmath33axis is depicted for the same simulations shown in figure [ fig : compmasspect ] .",
    "the buneman waves correspond to the fluctuations on @xmath134 scale that appear in the leading edge of the shock ( at @xmath229 , 240 - 245 , and 365 - 370 , in panels @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath56 , respectively ) .",
    "the black dashed line in the three panels marks the position of the shock density peak ( overshoot ) in the three simulations .",
    "when compared to the convective electric field ( @xmath230 ) , we see that the maximum electric field of the buneman waves is reduced by a factor of @xmath208 when @xmath4 passes from 25 to 400 . the same maximum energy for the accelerated electrons",
    "is observed in similar simulations but using @xmath231 ( simulations 2db-4 and 2db-5 ) .",
    "also , when trying cases similar to the ones shown in figures [ fig : compmasspect ] and [ fig : massbuneman ] but using @xmath232 ( simulations 2db-6 and 2db-7 ) , a decrease in the maximum energy to @xmath233 is seen , with no change by varying @xmath4 .",
    "thus , in general , the maximum energy attainable by the shock surfing mechanism appears to depend mainly on the shock velocity , and shows no changes for different values of @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , as the mass ratio @xmath4 is increased , the peak of the thermal part of the distribution gets closer to this maximum energy .",
    "this implies that the fraction of non - thermal electrons is reduced when @xmath4 approaches more realistic values .",
    "we conclude that this mechanism would not contribute significantly to electron acceleration in the fully realistic case of @xmath32 ."
