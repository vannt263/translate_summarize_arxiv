    "one of the main characteristics of ultracold atomic fermi gases is that the range of the interatomic potential is much smaller than the average distance between the particles .",
    "this eliminates the range of the interaction as one of the parameters of the system and makes the system have simple scaling and universality .",
    "s_-wave states are important for the two body scattering . despite the very short range of the interatomic interaction",
    ", it can have a large effect when the scattering length is large .",
    "the unitary limit is characterized by a scattering length @xmath0 satisfying @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the fermi momentum , and corresponds to the bec - bcs crossover region .",
    "this strongly correlated regime is governed by universal relations associated with the large value of the scattering length  @xcite .",
    "when the potential range is negligible the details of the interactions the only length scales are given by the scattering length and @xmath3 which is determined by the particle density .",
    "for infinite scattering length , the ground state energy per particle of the system is proportional to the energy of the free fermi gas , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the bertsch parameter and @xmath6 is the energy per particle for a noninteracting fermi gas and @xmath7 is the fermi energy .",
    "quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods  @xcite are a set of tools that can be used to study strongly correlated systems .",
    "the first successful study of ultracold fermi gases using qmc was made by carlson _",
    "_  @xcite more than ten years ago .",
    "qmc has been used to calculate various properties of ultracold gases such as the pairing gaps and energies for different values of scattering length  @xcite , the momentum distribution  @xcite , pair distribution functions  @xcite and condensate fraction  @xcite .",
    "these previous quantum monte carlo calculations have used a parameterized short , but finite , effective range model potential .",
    "a series of calculations are done with different values of the effective range are then extrapolated to zero - range .",
    "care needs to be used , since standard variational or diffusion monte carlo methods give a growing variance as the range of the potential is decreased .    in this paper",
    "we show how to perform qmc calculations using a zero - range interaction .",
    "since with monte carlo sampling , the probability of sampling two particles exactly at contact is zero , we must construct trial wave functions that have the correct behavior at contact .",
    "this imposes a boundary condition on the trial wave function . by enforcing this boundary condition on our trial wave function",
    ", we can eliminate the extrapolation to zero - range in variational monte carlo caluclations . for diffusion monte carlo calculations , the usual trotter breakup does not go through since the commutator terms diverge .",
    "instead , we must solve for the two - body propagator exactly with the zero - range potential .",
    "this calculation is easily done analytically , and we have developed methods for sampling this propagator .",
    "calculations with a finite effective range potential , and standard jastrow - bcs trial wave functions show a diverging variance when the effective range is small .",
    "this behavior requires that we also modify the sampling for both variational and diffusion monte carlo to reduce this variance , with our choices of the trial wave function .",
    "the correct wave function would not have these divergences , but we have not been able to write a trial wave function for the zero - range potential that is computationally efficient and removes these variances .",
    "the energy expectation value is well behaved , so by modifying our sampling procedure , we are able to cancel the divergent pieces and obtain reliable results even in the zero - range limit .    the paper is organized in the following way . in section  [",
    "sect : mc ] the qmc calculations are discussed for the zero - range potential system in the unitary limit . in section  [ sect :",
    "details ] we present the computational details used to perform the calculations .",

    "the hamiltonian for the unpolarized unitary fermi gas with @xmath8 particles of mass @xmath9 is @xmath10 where the primed index denotes the spin - down particles and the unprimed index the spin - up particles .",
    "the potential @xmath11 is attractive and has range that goes to zero keeping the scattering length fixed .",

    "@xmath17 is an antisymmetrizer operator which antisymmetrizes like spin particles , and @xmath18 is the cooper pair wave function that gives bcs pairing . since the purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the algorithm , we take @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the fermi wave vector for our finite periodic system . in this case",
    ", the bcs form reduces to a product of two slater determinants representing the ground state of the noninteracting system",
    ". fixed node calculations for this trial function have been done for finite range interactions with extrapolations to zero - range , which will allow comparisons to our method .",
    "the bcs function defines the nodal surface structure of the system .",
    "the nodes are fixed and we deal with the sign problem using the fixed - node approximation i.e. forbidding the system to cross the nodal surface . while we use the jastrow - slater limit here , we plan to optimize our results in the future with the more general jastrow - bcs wave function that has been widely used in the literature  @xcite .",
    "the trial wave function typically has adjustable parameters to obtain the upper bound limit for the ground state energy of the system in accordance with the variational principle .",
    "the quality of the results , obtained through the variational monte carlo method ( vmc ) , usually depends on the quality of the trial wave function employed in the calculations .",
    "these results can be improved by introducing parameters into the trial wave function based on physical insight .",
    "to use the zero - range potential , we can look at the limit of the behavior of the system when two unlike spin particles when the potential is of a very small , but finite range . in that case ,",
    "when the pair is within the range of the potential , the value of the potential must go to negative infinity as the range goes to zero .",

    "we concentrate on the @xmath25 case , but the calculation for other values is a straightforward extension .    to satisfy the boundary condition , and",
    "approximately satisfy the two - body schrdinger equation when unlike pairs are close together , we choose the unlike spin jastrow factor to be @xmath26 and @xmath27 is chosen to make the derivative continuous at @xmath28 .",
    "physically , we expect the healing distance to be of order the interparticle spacing as born out by the calculations .",
    "the best value of @xmath29 is obtained optimizing the variational energy of the system .",
    "because of the pauli exclusion principle , the like spin particles are kept apart .",
    "although a small improvement in variational values are possible by including a like spin jastrow factor , we have chosen to take it to be unity here .",
    "it affects neither the nodal structure nor the boundary condition of the zero - range interaction , its optimization will be left for future work .",
    "the variational energy of the system , which is the expectation value of the hamiltonian is @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the local energy and @xmath32 is interpreted as the probability density for a given configuration @xmath33 . in a standard variational monte carlo , this probability density is sampled using the metropolis et al .",

    "monte carlo  @xcite , the trial wave function is evolved in imaginary time .",
    "the imaginary time - dependent schrdinger equation for the system is @xmath36 and the solution is @xmath37 where @xmath38 controls the normalization of the wave function in the limit of a long imaginary time .",
    "the energy expectation value as a function of imaginary time is  @xcite . @xmath39 with the probability density @xmath40    including the @xmath41 importance function allows us to sample @xmath42 .",

    "standard diffusion monte carlo uses a trotter breakup to sample @xmath45 . as we noted above",
    ", this will fail for the zero - range interaction because its strength goes to negative infinity .",
    "instead we use the pair product approximation which is commonly used for path integral calculations@xcite .",

    "the 2-body propagator separates into relative and center of mass coordinates in the usual way .",
    "the center of mass propagates like a free particle with solution @xmath49    the relative coordinates can be separated into the different angular momentum partial waves , and in the limit of zero - range , only the s - wave component is different from the zero potential , free particle result . for the unitary limit ,",
    "the result is @xmath50 the first term is the usual free - particle pair propagator , the second is the additional s - wave amplitude from the interaction . besides the usual gaussian , it has a @xmath51 prefactor .",
    "the importance sampling with a trial function with the correct boundary conditions , multiplies this by @xmath52 , this becomes @xmath53 and this cancels the volume element factor @xmath54 when sampled in spherical coordinates . therefore sampling the two - body propagator , including importance sampling is straightforward .",

    "the maximum displacement of each particles is adjusted to minimize the autocorrelation .    with the correct boundary condition",
    ", the delta function in @xmath62 at the origin exactly cancels the potential contribution .",
    "however , since the @xmath63 at the origin , its form looks like the potential of a point charge at the origin .",
    "its gradient will look like the electric field of a point charge , and the terms in the kinetic energy like @xmath64 will diverge when the distance between particles @xmath65 and @xmath66 goes to zero . however , when this distance goes to zero , all orientations of the @xmath67 pair are equally probable .",
    "integrating over this orientation shows that the divergent terms give zero contribution as the separation goes to zero .",
    "however , the variance from a standard metropolis et al . sampling will diverge ( as also seen in previous work when the range of the finite range potential is reduced ) .",
    "we therefore do not calculate the energy with the standard metropolis samples . instead , before calculating the energy",
    ", we make an additional metropolis trial move where we interchange the positions of the closest unlike spin pair .",
