    "the skein algebra @xmath4 was introduced by j. przytycki @xcite and v. turaev @xcite based on the kauffman bracket @xcite , and is a quantization of the @xmath8-character variety of @xmath1 along the goldman - weil - petersson poisson form , see @xcite .",

    "v.  fock @xcite and chekhov and fock @xcite made a conjecture that a quantum trace map as in equation exists .",

    "skein algebras of surfaces , or more generally skein modules of 3-manifolds , are objects which can be defined using simple geometric notions but are hard to deal with since their algebra is difficult to handle .",
    "their geometric definition helps to relate skein algebras / modules to topological objects like the fundamental groups , the jones polynomial , etc .",
    "for example , understanding the skein modules of knot complements can help to prove the aj conjecture , which relates the jones polynomial and the fundamental group of a knot @xcite , and the skein modules are used in the construction of topological quantum field theories @xcite .",
    "the introduction of the quantum trace map is a breakthrough in the study of skein algebras ; it embeds the skein algebra @xmath4 into quantum tori which have simple algebraic structure .",

    "muller showed that the inclusion @xmath13 leads to a natural embedding @xmath14 .",

    "the injective algebra homomorphism @xmath20 defined by @xmath21 is equal to the quantum trace map of bonahon and wong .",
    "the map @xmath18 could be considered as a kind of fourier transform , as it relates two types of coordinates based to matrices which are almost dual to each other . when the quantum parameter is set to 1",
    ", @xmath18 becomes the map expressing the shear coordinates in terms of penner coordinates in the decorated teichmller space @xcite .",
