    "besides of its simplicity , the well known nearest neighbors ( n.n . ) ising model on the cayley tree still offers new interesting phenomenon ( see e.g. @xcite for a recent review ) . on this tree , as a consequence of non - amenability , not only gibbs measures but also free energies depend on the boundary conditions .    a study of this dependence is given in @xcite .",
