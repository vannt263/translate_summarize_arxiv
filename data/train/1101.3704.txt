    "tellurite glasses are known to have wide transmission range ( 0.35  6.0  m ) , high linear and nonlinear refractive indices and potentially low optical losses in the near- and mid - ir ranges .",
    "because of this tellurite glasses are of considerable interest as fiber optics materials .",
    "glasses intended for optical fibers manufacturing should contain low amount of impurities responsible for optical loss .",
    "@xmath0 transition metals ions ( v , cr , mn , fe , co , ni and cu ) giving rise to intense absorption in the visible and near infrared region represent one of the main groups of the limiting impurities .    in the literature there are no quantitative data on the influence of @xmath0 transition metals impurities on optical absorption in the transmission spectral range of tellurite glasses . on the other hand , absorption spectra of @xmath0 transition metals ions in zirconium fluoride- and silica - based glasses are studied to a considerable extent @xcite . in zirconium",

    "cr , co , fe and cu impurities with extinction coefficient 300  700  db  km@xmath1  ppm@xmath1 in the silica transparency range , 1.3  1.6  m , are known to be the most limiting impurities in silica fibers @xcite .",
    "extinction coefficient relates optical absorption intensity to impurities content .",
    "hence knowledge of the extinction coefficient spectral dependence is needed , on the one hand , to control undesirable impurities content in optical materials using the materials transmission spectra , to develop justified requirements for the acceptable content of impurities and to adjust technology to improve the optical parameters of materials ; on the other hand , to control the content of dopants explicitly added to the material to optimize the characteristics of the developed lasers , optical amplifiers and converters .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to study the transmission spectra of nickel - doped tungstate - tellurite glasses , , to determine the spectral dependence of extinction coefficient in the 450  2700  nm wavelength range and to relate absorption spectra of ions in the tungstate - tellurite glass with structure of their environment .",
    "tungstate - tellurite glasses is known to be one of the most crystallization - resistant binary tellurite glasses .",
    "nickel as a dopant is chosen for the investigation on account of its abundance in oxides used as raw materials and of the only valence state , @xmath2 , of nickel in oxides .",
    "the latter is of importance in view of oxidizing nature of as macro component of the glass under consideration .",
    "tungstate - tellurite glasses were prepared by cooling molten high - purity oxides mixture @xcite .",
    "and oxides with nickel impurity content as low as @xmath4   were used as raw components .",
    "mixture of powdered raw components were pre - dried to remove water and then melted in platinum crucible heated by high - frequency inductor placed in oxygen atmosphere with 0.8  ppm humidity .",
    "the melt was homogenized for 1  hour at a temperature of @xmath5 ( monitored by an optical pyrometer ) .",
    "after homogenizing melting , part of the melt was solidified into glass for later use to dilute nickel - doped glass melts .",
    "nickel oxide was added to the rest of the melt to obtain doped glass containing 1  wt.%  nio .",
    "once the nickel - doped melt was homogenized , part of it was vitrified and the previously prepared diluent glass was added to the rest of the melt in the crucible . repeating the process several times , glasses containing from 0.786 up to @xmath6   were obtained .",
    "nickel oxide concentration in the solidified glass was calculated from material balance equation .",
    "glasses samples with thickness from 0.5 to 50  mm with optically polished faces were prepared .",
    "transmission spectra of these samples in visible and infrared spectral ranges were measured using perkin elmer lambda  900 spectrophotometer ( in the 400  3000  nm range ) and bruker ifs  113v fourier spectrometer ( in the 1000  10000  nm range ) with spectral resolution better than 4  nm .",
    "[ fig:1 ] shows transmission spectra of 0.5  mm - thick samples containing from 0.009 to 0.786  . as viewed in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , in the absorption spectrum of glass there are two broad bands with maxima near 810 and 1320  nm and a band with maximum at wavelength @xmath7  nm falling within the short - wavelength edge of glass transparency range .",
    "the absorption intensity in all the bands increases with nickel content growth .",
    "transmission spectra were measured for the optical path length from 0.5 to 22  mm for samples with different nickel content .",

    "[ fig:2 ] shows the light attenuation in the peak of the 1320  nm band in glasses containing 0.053   vs. the sample thickness together with linear approximation of the experimental points .",

    "[ fig:3 ] are shown the experimental data and the approximation of the bulk absorption coefficient for the 1320  nm band for all the samples studied with ni content up to approximately 0.12  . as evident from fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] , in this range of nickel content absorption in the maximum of the 1320  nm band is well fitted by a linear function of the absorbing ions concentration .",
    "the straight line slope representing the extinction coefficient is equal to @xmath10 or @xmath11  @xmath12 .    since both the number of absorption bands and their shapes do not depend on nickel content in the glass , it is possible to derive the spectral dependence of the extinction coefficient shown in fig .",

    "modeling of the structure of impurity nickel centers in tungstate - tellurite glass network was performed using periodic model constructed on the basis of the supercell containing 32 groups ( 96 atoms in total ) , with the initial atoms arrangement corresponding to paratellurite lattice .",

    "wavelengths of symmetry allowed and forbidden transitions are marked by solid and dashed arrows , respectively ]    results of the modeling allow us to interpret the observed absorption spectrum of ions in glass as follows .    in the case of cubic symmetry of the ion octahedral environment",
    "three main absorption bands are known to occur ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the bands correspond to spin - allowed e1 transitions from the ground state , , to the excited states , ( ( a )  transition in fig .",

    "besides , weak absorption band caused by spin - forbidden transition from the ground state to the excited state is sometimes observed near the ( b )  band ( ( b@xmath30 )  transition in fig .  [ fig:7 ] ) . notice to avoid confusion that all these transitions are parity - forbidden but become slightly allowed owing to vibronic contributions .",
    "calculation using the above - listed parameters values yields the these transitions wavelengths for ion in environment to be ( a )  1000  nm , ( b )  600  nm , ( c )  350  nm , ( b@xmath30 ) 723  nm , in satisfactory agreement with the typical values for environment given above .    in or trigonally distorted octahedral environment of the ion",

    "e1 transitions from the ground state to the excited , and turn out to be both spin- and symmetry - allowed ( ( a@xmath31 ) , ( a@xmath32 ) , ( b@xmath32 ) and ( c@xmath32 ) transitions in fig .

    "the transition from the ground state to the excited one is still spin - forbidden ( ( b@xmath30 ) transition in fig .",

    "the remark concerning the vibronic contributions remains valid .    in our case , ( a@xmath31 ) and",

    "thus , in binary tungstate - tellurite glasses , due to strong trigonal distortion of the octahedral environment of ions , absorption bands of these ions turn out to be shifted substantially towards longer wavelengths in comparison with the absorption pattern typical for nickel - doped crystals . in this case , obviously , the ir absorption band ( near 1320  nm ) should be strongly heterogeneously broadened while the ( heterogeneous ) broadening of the other absorption bands should be relatively weak .",
    "in this study we measured transmission spectra of tungstate tellurite glass samples containing from 1 to @xmath34  wt.%  nio and obtained spectral dependence of ions extinction coefficient in this glass in the 450  2700  nm wavelength range . these measurements together with our computer modeling of glass structure suggest ions in such glasses to occur in strongly trigonally distorted octahedral sites .",
    "this results in corresponding absorption bands shifted significantly towards longer wavelengths compared to typical nickel - doped crystals and the absorption intensity being much higher than in silica- and zirconium fluoride - based glasses .",
