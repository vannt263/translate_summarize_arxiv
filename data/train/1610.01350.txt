    "with the development of computational power and technique , the input of ab - initio calculation ",
    "nn interaction  has became the one of the main uncertainties in the few- and many - body calculations .",
    "due to the fact that calculations needed to be performed within a model space , an effective and model - independent nn potential which converges fast enough within the model space is required .",
    "except for fadeev - like approach  which only involves the ultraviolet cutoff  the model space is usually truncated in both the ultraviolet ( @xmath2 ) and infrared ( @xmath3 ) scales .",
    "therefore , before trusting the results one has to check carefully the convergent pattern with respect to @xmath2 and @xmath3 .    in the past two decades ,",
    "interaction deduced from effective filed theory ( eft)@xcite has been developed and significant efforts has been spent on the goal of providing good and model - independent description of data .",
    "the bare nn interaction obtained in the continuum can not be directly applied into few- or many - body calculation since : ( a ) the model space to perform calculations usually contains both ultraviolet and infrared cutoffs .",
    "( b ) ultraviolet cutoff of the bare potential is too hard .",
    "one common treatment is to perform an unitary transformation ( such as lee - suzuki or similarity renormalization group ( srg ) ) to generate effective interactions from the bare one@xcite .",
    "however , in addition to loosing some level of resolution  which is unavoidable when model space is reduced  the unitary transformation also generates at least one additional scale , such as the srg  flow parameter and the induced higher body force . since the eft power counting is usually organized in the continuum with respect to @xmath2 alone , those extra cutoffs ( due to @xmath3 and other additional scales from unitary transformation ) could in principle destroy the power counting after the transformation . without a complete check , the interaction serves as input will loose its model independent feature .",
    "it is therefore desirable to build the effective interactions within a limited number of basis in an alternative way .",
    "the philosophy of present work is that , instead of renormalizing the interaction in the continuum first and transforming it into a given model space later , hoping to find a method of truncation ( along with certain conditions ) which does not affect the model - independent feature of the original interaction , one performs the renormalization directly in a given model space by utilizing the low energy constants ( lecs ) in the eft .",
    "this direction has been advocated by the arizona group ia05,ia07a , ia07b , ia10,ji10,ia10a , rj12 , where the pionless potential is direct renormalized in a given ho space with or without a physical trap .",
    "the use of the physical trap allows one to connect the phase shifts ( @xmath4 ) to eigenvalues of matrix element by busch formula@xcite .",
    "similar applications to bosonic system is carried out in ref.@xcite .",
    "an alternative approach is to adopt the j - matrix formalism to relate @xmath4 to the eigenvalues@xcite .",
    "finally , an approach which deduces the potential through bloch - horowitz equation  the ho - based effective theory ( hobet)is also exploredhobet , hobet2 .    in this work the harmonic oscillator ( ho ) basis is adopted .",
    "we construct the chiral eft interaction directly in a given model space without the ho trap .",
    "similar to ref.@xcite , the renormalization of the eft interaction under the given infrared cutoff @xmath3 and ultraviolet cutoff @xmath2 is done through the inverse scattering j - matrix method@xcite , which enables a direct connection between the eigenstates in truncated ho space to the nn scattering phase shifts .",
    "the truncated model space is characterized by an ultraviolet cutoff @xmath5 and an infrared cutoff @xmath6 . here",
    "@xmath7 is the nucleon mass , @xmath8 , with @xmath9 the maximum number of shells included in the calculation and @xmath10 the angular momentum quantum number , @xmath11 is the oscillator frequency associated with the ho basis used .",
    "the main advantage of our approach is that the truncation is only controlled by two scales ( @xmath12 ) , and this allows a straight forward renormalization group analysis .",
    "moreover , recent studies@xcite suggest that the subleading chiral potential can not be included non - perturbatively , if one requires the result to be renormalization group ( rg ) invariant .",
    "therefore , in this work we adopt the new power counting@xcite which treats the subleading order potential perturbatively and indicate how the perturbative treatment of chiral potential can be applied in few- and many - body calculations .",
    "note that although the exact power counting in chiral eft at nn sector is still an open question , our method can be applied to any arrangement of power counting .",
    "the structure of the present work is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce the inverse j - matrix method . in section iii",
    ", we apply the j - matrix method to the renormalization of the leading order chiral eft potential . in section iv",

    "the j - matrix method was initially derived in atomic physics@xcite , and later in nuclear physics using harmonic oscillator basis@xcite .",
