    "a new state of matter , the strongly coupled quark gluon plasma ( sqgp ) , is created in relativistic heavy ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "one of the most important evidence is the measured large elliptic flow in non - central heavy ion collisions , believed to stem out of final state interactions in the anisotropic overlap zone  @xcite .",
    "the measured elliptic flow is so large that it is compatiable with hydrodynamic calculations with minimal shear viscosity to entropy density ratio ( @xmath9 ) , indicating maximal final - state interactions  @xcite .",
    "present hydrodynamic calculations start from an initial condition of isotropic momentum distribution .",
    "it has been argued , however , that the initial momentum anisotropy may not be zero in relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "for example , it is suggested that the wave function is asymmetric in momentum space due to heisenberg uncertainty principle because of the spatial anisotropic overlap  @xcite . in classical yang - mills dynamics",
    "it is found that initial momentum anisotropy can arise from the event - by - event breaking of rotational invariance in local domains whose size is determined by the saturation scale  @xcite .",
    "initial flow in classical yang - mills field can also develop from the non - abelian generalization of gauss law and ampere s and faraday s laws  @xcite .",
    "in proton - proton collisions color reconnection can produce initial flow - like correlations  @xcite and it may be relevant for heavy ion collisions as well .",
    "if there indeed exist initial momentum anisotropies and these initial anisotropies can partially survive to the final state , then the comparison of data to hydrodynamics without initial momentum anisotropy would not be reliable to extract transport properties of the sqgp , such as the @xmath9 . in this paper , we investigate the survival rate of an input initial momentum anisotropy using a parton transport model .",
    "we employ a multi - phase transport ( ampt ) model with string melting and 3 mb parton cross section  @xcite .",
    "this model can describe well the measured particle rapidity distributions , transverse momentum spectra , and elliptic flow  @xcite .",
    "ampt consists of four main parts : the initial condition , parton - parton interactions , hadronization , and hadronic scatterings .",
    "the initial condition is taken from the hijing model  @xcite .",
    "it uses glauber nuclear geometry to model the spatial and momentum information of minijet partons from hard processes and strings from soft processes .",
    "the interactions of partons are treated by the zpc parton cascade model  @xcite .",
    "after parton interactions cease , a combined coalescence and string fragmentation model is used for the hadronization of partons .",
    "finally , the art model is used to describe the elastic and inelastic scatterings of hadrons  @xcite .",
    "elliptic flow can be quantified by @xmath2 , the second harmonic fourier coefficient of the particle azimuthal distribution in momentum space  @xcite , @xmath10 in ampt , the initial parton azimuthal distribution is isotropic : @xmath11 we can artificially create a momentum anisotropy by `` squeezing '' particles towards a particular plane .",
    "we first choose this plane to be the participant plane ( pp ) of the initial partons in configuration space .",
    "the azimuthal angle of the participant plane is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are polar coordinate position .",
    "mathematically we change each parton s initial azimuthal angle @xmath14 into @xmath15 by : @xmath16 such that @xmath17 in order to achieve an initial anisotropy @xmath18 with respect to @xmath19 , one applies @xmath20    second , we choose this particular plane to be a random azimuthal direction @xmath21 , not the participant plane along which hydrodynamic collective flow develops .",

    "the event then evolves as modeled by ampt . in this analysis",
    "we have used a given @xmath24 in each event , independent of the parton @xmath4 .",
    "we analyze the momentum anisotropies of the final - state partons ( i.e.  after parton interactions cease and before hadronization ) and the final - state hadrons by the fourier coefficients  @xcite : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the particle ( parton or hadron ) azimuthal angle .",
    "experimentally , however , the participant plane is inaccessible .",
    "the momentum anisotropy is often analyzed by final - state two - particle correlations . in absence of intrinsic particle correlations ( nonflow ) ,",
    "the final - state two - particle correlations are caused by each particle s correlation to the common participant plane ( i.e.  flow correlations ) of eq .",
    "[ eq : definition1 ] .",
    "in such a case , the two - particle density is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the azimuthal angle difference between the two particles .",
    "the momentum anisotropy can thereby be calculated by @xmath29 without requiring the participant plane  @xcite .",
    "we use the q - cumulant method  @xcite to calculate @xmath30 in each event , by @xmath31 here the second - harmonic flow vector @xmath32 is given by @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the number of particles used in the q - cumulant .",

    "as can be seen from the figure , the @xmath61 data points approximately lie along the dashed line .",
