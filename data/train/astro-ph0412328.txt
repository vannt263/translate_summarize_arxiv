    "after two and a half years of operation , the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) on board hst has collected a huge number of observations of stellar systems , and produced a growing database of colour magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) and luminosity functions . in order to be able to exploit fully the information contained in these data sets , and to extract a number of fundamental parameters we are interested in , such as metal content , ages , distances , mass functions , etc , we need to compare the observations with theoretical models .",
    "the basic requirement for this comparison is the conversion of stellar models into the acs photometric observational domain .",
    "this conversion is the purpose of the present paper .",
    "we have used the most up to date information on the acs specifications to define a natural , in - flight photometric system and to transform the pietrinferni et al .",
    "( 2004 ) models into the same system . while it is foreseeable that the acs photometric calibration will improve somewhat as more standard fields are studied and cross compared , the in - flight transmission efficiency curves are now reasonably well established and we would not expect them to change very much .",
    "it therefore makes sense to provide a conversion of theoretical stellar models into the observational domain so that more quantitative and qualitative interpretations can be made of observations .",
    "it is worth mentioning that most astronomical photometric investigations are based on some `` standard '' photometric system . here , by standard ,",
    "we mean a photometric system that has been widely used for a long time in different observatories ( e.g. , the johnson - kron - cousins , strmgren , thuan - gunn , etc systems , see , e.g. , landolt - brnstein  1982 ) , and possibly defined by a number of standard stars well distributed in the sky , whose flux has been carefully measured .",
    "the calibration to a standard system is sometimes the only way to interpret properly the collected data , e.g.  when we need to compare our photometric sequences with others collected with different instruments or at different epochs , or with standard results from theoretical models .",
    "still , it must be clearly stated that when the transmission curves of the equipment used to collect the observations are rather different from those of any existing standard system , the transformation of the data to a standard system is difficult , and can be unreliable , particularly for extreme stars ( i.e. , extreme colours , unusual spectral type , high reddening , etc ) .",
    "a good example of a problem that one can encounter in using even slightly different filter sets at the same telescope is given in momany et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "many of the acs filters differ substantially from the `` standard '' filters , and the high photometric precision possible with acs makes the systematic differences more significant .",
    "thankfully , the filter and instrumental response are better characterized for acs than they are for the typical ground - based observatory , so that it is possible to avoid standard systems altogether and compare the data and the model in the same system :   the observational domain .",
    "all that is required for this is to determine an empirical zeropoint for each filter by observing a reference star with a well - characterized spectrum in order to characterize accurately the throughput and response of the detector for each filter .",
    "the theoretical models can then be integrated over the same spectral response and compared directly with the data .",
    "such a procedure for comparing models with data is far preferable to the typical procedure of converting both models and data into a `` standard '' system .",
    "therefore , we calculated a set of empirical zero points that will allow direct comparison of observational data and theoretical models .",
    "we have based our calibration on the reference spectrum of vega , and so we will refer to our photometric system as the `` acs vega - mag system '' . in our derivation of zero points , we used the in - flight sensitivity , measured by sirianni et al .",
    "( 2002 , and sirianni 2003 , private communication ) .    in this paper",
    "we have focused our attention on the wide field channel ( wfc ) of the acs , but the same procedure can be used to measure the photometric zero points for the high resolution channel ( hrc ) .    in the next section ,",
    "we describe briefly the total transmission curves , the procedure followed to obtain the zero points , and give the aperture corrections . in section 3 ,",
    "we briefly describe the adopted stellar evolution models , our procedure to transform the models into the observational plane , and the method used to take into account interstellar absorption . in section 4",
    "we give the zero points and the formul   to convert both the theoretical tracks and the observed data to the acs vega - mag photometric system .",
    "section 5 describes the hst archive data used to test the models , and shows , as an example , how these data have been photometrically calibrated and compared with our models in the acs vega - mag plane .",
    "conclusions follow in section 6 together with instructions on how to download the transformed models .",
    "in this section , we define our photometric system and will refer to it as the acs(/wfc ) vega - mag system .",
    "the first step toward the definition of our photometric system is to calculate the total transmission curves , t(@xmath3 ) for each individual band .",
    "these are the products of the individual transmission curves , t@xmath4 , for 5 different terms .",
    "@xmath5 in detail , the t@xmath4 are : @xmath6 the transmission curve of the window of the dewar , @xmath7 the transmission curve of the filters , @xmath8 the reflectivity of the wfc / acs mirrors ( 3 mirrors ) , @xmath9 an average of the two ccd quantum efficiencies and @xmath10 the transmission curve of the optical telescope assembly ( ota ) of hst . in order to outline our procedure , we consider two commonly used filters , f606w and f814w",
    ". we will extend the results to other filters in section 4 .",
    "all the individual transmission curves are shown in fig .  1 , where two thick lines show the total system transmissions for the two considered filters .",
    "the transmission curves measured in the laboratory differ significantly from those found on - orbit ( sirianni et al .",
    "2002 ) . in the following",
    "we will use _ only _ the on - orbit adjusted total transmission curves obtained by sirianni et al .",
    "( private communication , paper in preparation 2004 ) .",
    "the uncertainities for these total transmission curves are within 0.5% ( de marchi et al .",
    "2004 , sirianni et al .  in preparation 2004 ) .",
    "we describe below the procedure used to define the zero points of the system .",
    "we have used the spectrum of vega from ftp:// ftp.stsci.edu/ cdbs/ cdbs2/ grid/ k93models/ standards/ vega_reference.fits .",
    "details of this spectrum can be found at http://www.stsci.edu/ instruments/ observatory/ pdf/ scs8.rev.pdf ; hereafter it will be denoted as @xmath11 , in units @xmath12 .",
    "the integrated flux of the assumed spectrum of vega under the total transmission curve @xmath13 of the filter f606w @xmath2 instrument is :    @xmath14 @xmath15 this number is the quantity that theoreticians will need to rescale their models to the photometric system we adopt ( see sec .  4 ) .",
    "the estimated number of expected photo - electrons ( @xmath16 ) is : @xmath17 @xmath18 where the photon energy @xmath19 is given by @xmath20    therefore , for vega , the counts detected by the system in digital numbers ( dn ) would be : @xmath21 @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the effective collecting area of the telescope ( 45,239 @xmath24 , with the secondary obscuration already accounted for ) , and gain is the conversion factor from e@xmath25 to dns . at this point",
    ", we can define the zero point of our magnitude system in the f606w band by imposing @xmath26 for the magnitude of vega ( with the assumed spectrum ) : @xmath27 } = 26.391\\ ] ] for simplicity , we have defined this zero point for gain @xmath28 1 @xmath29 .",
    "since flt images provided by stsci are already in photo - electrons ( e@xmath25 ) rather than in dns ( note that drz images are given in e@xmath25 s@xmath30 ) hereafter , to avoid any confusion , we will not consider the gain , and we will refer to @xmath31 rather than to @xmath32 . in an analogous way we can define the zero point of the f814w band : @xmath33 and in a similar way for all the other filters .",
    "the formula that observers should use to calibrate their observations into our wfc / acs vega - mag system magnitudes in the f606w band is : @xmath34 where exptime is the exposure time , and @xmath35 is the aperture correction . in the next section",
    "we discuss in detail the aperture correction , which we will always treat as a positive quantity to be subtracted .",
    "this calibration is intended for the officially calibrated drz images which are already corrected for : flat field , dark , bias , and geometrical distortion .",
    "breathing of the telescope tube , the complex optical system , and charge diffusion induce temporal and spatial variation of the core of the point - spread function ( psf ) , such that the @xmath36-ring ratio of the diffraction figure changes considerably across the chip and at a minor level with orbital phase .    for these reasons , we choose to refer our zero points to an infinite aperture .",
    "that makes it easier for those studying surface photometry of extended sources to calibrate their magnitudes to this system .",
    "the aperture corrections for extended sources are null , being the zero points of the system referred to an infinite aperture : @xmath37 on the other hand , in practice all the energy of a point source is contained within @xmath38 ( @xmath39 80 pixels ) , and @xmath40 within @xmath41 ( @xmath39 10 pixels ) .",
    "in dense environments , where crowding makes an aperture correction to an infinite aperture impossible , one has to rely on the in - flight encircled energy .",
    "this means that one has to correct the instrumental magnitude ( for example the psf - fitted magnitude ) to the magnitude at a specified aperture @xmath42 by adding a @xmath43 , and then sum an additional quantity @xmath44 , obtained from the tabulated encircled energy in order to link the magnitudes to the infinite aperture for which we have calculated the zero points .    in summary , @xmath45    in table  1 we give the @xmath46 corrections to be added to the zero points for two circular apertures of radius @xmath47 ( @xmath396 pixels ) and @xmath41 ( as in holtzman et al .",
    "1995 ) and for the different filters . for clarity , we also report in tab .",
    "1 the correction to zero points for an infinite aperture , which is zero by definition .",
    ".@xmath48 corrections to be added to the zero points .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      in this section we compare the theoretical models transformed to the acs vega - mag system with observed cmds .",
    "figure 3 displays our adopted @xmath49-enhanced isochrones and zahbs compared with the observed cmds of the ggcs 47  tuc ( ngc  104 ) , ngc  6752 , and m92  ( ngc  6341 ) .",
    "these clusters span a wide metallicity range ( @xmath50 < -0.6 $ ] ) .",
    "we selected these clusters for the comparison because of their very low extinction and lack of differential reddening .    in the following discussion , in order to make the comparison with the values in the literature more straightforward , we give the reddening @xmath51 and the apparent distance modulus in the @xmath52 band ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "the @xmath51 comes from @xmath54 as adopted in the best fitting by interpolation of the values in table 3 .",
    "the @xmath53 comes from the best fitting distance modulus in the f606w band ( @xmath55 ) : @xmath56 , where @xmath57 .    in the case of 47  tuc",
    "we used @xmath49-enhanced ( @xmath58>=0.4 $ ] ) isochrones with @xmath59\\!=\\!-0.66 $ ] ( z@xmath280.008 ) , a value in very good agreement with spectroscopic measurements ( see , e.g. , percival et al .",
    "2002 , gratton et al .",
    "2003 ) ; the best match is obtained for an apparent distance modulus @xmath60 , an age of 10 gyr , and a reddening @xmath61 ( the 8 and 13 gyr isochrones are also shown ) .",
    "these values of distance modulus and reddening are consistent with empirical determinations by percival et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and gratton et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "the quality of the fit is satisfactory along most of the isochrone , worsening at the redder end of both the rgb and ms .",
    "the deviation of the lower part of the sequence from the models for intermediate - metallicity clusters is well known ( see bedin et al.2001 ) .    for ngc  6752",
    "we have employed our isochrones with @xmath62\\!=\\!-$]1.26 ( z@xmath280.002 ) , a value close to the estimate by rutledge et al .",
    "( 1997 ) with their calibration of the caii triplet index on the ggc carretta & gratton ( 1997 ) metallicity scale .",
    "we obtain a best match with @xmath53@xmath2813.25 , an age of 12 gyr and @xmath51@xmath280.04 ( the 10 and 14 gyr isochrones are also shown ) .",
    "again , the reddening agrees with independent empirical estimates ( e.g. gratton et al .",
    "2003 ) , whereas the distance is slightly longer than the ms - fitting estimates ( carretta et al .",
    "2000 , gratton et al .",
    "these empirical estimates employ a metallicity @xmath390.2 dex lower than our adopted value ; it is interesting to note , judging from the numerical experiment performed by carretta et al .",
    "( 2000 , their fig .",
    "5 ) , that their empirical ms - fitting distance would come into agreement with our value if our assumed metallicity is used in their ms - fitting technique .",
    "had we used our isochrones for @xmath59 \\!=\\!-$]1.57 ( z@xmath280.001 ) and a value close to the metallicity estimate by rutledge et al .",
    "( 1997 ) obtained calibrating the calcium index on the zinn & west ( 1984 ) metallicity scale , the quality of the fit to the rgb location would be worse ( isochrone too blue ) , the age older by @xmath391 gyr , @xmath630.02 mag higher and @xmath640.07 mag larger .    the comparison with the m  92 ( ngc  6341 ) cmd has been performed using isochrones with [ fe / h]@xmath652.1 ( z@xmath280.0003 ) , a value in fair agreement with the estimate by carretta & gratton  ( 1997 ) ( @xmath59 \\!=\\!-2.16 $ ] ) .",
    "the best agreement is achieved for an age of 12  gyr , @xmath51@xmath280.04 and @xmath66 ( the 10 and 14 gyr isochrones are also shown ) .",
    "in this paper we have proposed a simple zero - point photometric calibration of the acs / wfc data , based on a model spectrum of vega and the most up to date in - flight transmission curves of the acs camera .",
    "we have named this new in - flight system the _ wfc / acs vega - mag photometric system_. the proposed calibration is accurate at the level of a few hundredths of a magnitude .",
    "we give the basic recipes to calibrate both the observed data and the models , and present a set of models by pietrinferni et al .",
    "( 2004 ) already transformed into the new acs vega - mag system .",
    "since the primary purpose of this investigation is to make available to the public a complete set of stellar models and isochrones transformed to the acs vega - mag system , we have developed the following web site where all models and isochrones can be retrieved :   http:// www.te.astro.it /basti /index.php .",
    "we show cmds for 5 galactic globular clusters , spanning a metallicity range @xmath0[fe / h]@xmath1 ; these cmds have been obtained from acs observations , calibrated to the acs vega - mag system , and used to test our models .",
    "we also give the fiducial points representing their rgb , sgb , and main sequence from the red giant branch tip to several magnitudes below the to .",
