    "the `` slow dynamics '' and glass transition of both simple and molecular liquids has been a topic of significant interest in recent years .",
    "the initial slowing down of liquids at temperatures down to @xmath1 , where relaxation times approach @xmath2  ns , has been well described by the mode - coupling theory ( mct )  @xcite .",
    "mct has been successfully applied to a wide variety of real and model systems  @xcite , including hard spheres  @xcite , ni@xmath3p@xmath4  @xcite , sio@xmath5  @xcite , and polymer melts  @xcite .",
    "however , there has not been an extensive test of the validity of the mct predictions for a model system over a wide range of pressures and along different thermodynamic paths .    at low pressure ,",
    "it was shown previously that the power - law behavior of dynamic properties in the spc / e model  @xcite can be explained using mct  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the possible relationship between the experimentally - observed power - law behavior and the predictions of mct has been discussed  @xcite . the experimentally - observed locus of apparent power - law singularities of dynamic and thermodynamic properties [ fig .",
    "[ fig : water - t_s ] ] is of particular interest  @xcite , and has catalysed the development of three scenarios to explain the anomalous properties of water : ( i ) the existence of a spinodal bounding the stability of the liquid in the superheated , stretched , and supercooled states  @xcite ; ( ii ) the existence of a liquid - liquid phase transition line separating two liquid phases differing in density  @xcite ; ( iii ) a singularity - free scenario in which the thermodynamic anomalies are related to the presence of low - density and low - entropy structural heterogeneities  @xcite .",
    "the predictions of mct are of interest since mct might account for the apparent power - law behavior of dynamic properties on cooling , thereby removing the need for a thermodynamic explanation of the dynamic properties of water .",
    "in this article we focus on two related issues : ( i ) the possibility of using mct to explain the slow dynamics of water under pressure , and ( ii ) a test of the validity of the mct predictions over an extremely wide pressure range in a system with dramatic structural changes .",
    "we find that mct provides a good account of the slow dynamics of the spc / e model for water at all pressures , with the structure evolving continuously from an open tetrahedral network to a densely packed fluid , similar to a lennard - jones type liquid . by examining the wave - vector dependence of collective dynamics , we are able to discover how these structural changes are reflected in the dynamic behavior of the liquid .",
    "we are also able to test the validity of the relationship predicted by mct for the diffusivity exponent @xmath6 and the von schweidler exponent @xmath7 over a wide range of values @xmath6 and @xmath7 [ fig .",

    "the dynamic properties of the st2 potential  @xcite at one pressure , and of the tip4p  @xcite potential at several pressures , have also recently been discussed .",
    "we will focus our discussion on the idealized form of mct , originally formulated to describe spherically - symmetric potentials .",
    "recent extensions have been made to account for the rotational motion present in non - spherical molecular systems  @xcite , such as water .",
    "the idealized version of mct has been shown to provide a good account for the center - of - mass motion for the spc / e model  @xcite .",
    "we provide only a brief account of the mct predictions relevant to the results of this article , and we refer the reader to extensive reviews for more information  @xcite .",
    "mct assumes that localization , or `` caging '' of molecules due to the slow rearrangement of neighboring molecules , is the source of the dramatic increase of relaxation times on cooling , leading to a strong coupling between single particle motion and the density fluctuations of the liquid . indeed , according to mct , the",
    "density fluctuations , measured by the structure factor @xmath8 , entirely determine the long time dynamic behavior .",
    "mct accounts for the loss of correlation by the interaction of density mode fluctuations , ignoring other possible mechanisms for relaxation .",
    "mct predicts the asymptotic power - law divergence of correlation times , and power - law vanishing of the diffusion constant @xmath9 at a critical temperature @xmath10 , where we refer to @xmath11 as the diffusivity exponent . in real systems , `` freezing '' of the system dynamics is avoided at @xmath12 , as    =    relaxation mechanisms not accounted for by mct become significant .",
    "however , @xmath12 can still be interpreted as a `` crossover temperature '' where the dynamics change from being dominated by density fluctuations to being controlled by `` activated '' processes . some recent work",
    "has also demonstrated the significance of @xmath12 as a crossover temperature where relaxation occurs primarily through basin hopping  @xcite , in the energy landscape view of liquid dynamics  @xcite .",

    "mct predicts that the scaling exponents @xmath25 , @xmath7 , and @xmath6 are _ not _ independent ; @xmath25 and @xmath7 are related by the exponent parameter @xmath26 using the relationship @xmath27 ^ 2}{\\gamma(1 - 2a ) } = \\frac{[\\gamma(1-b)]^2}{\\gamma(1 + 2b ) } \\label{eq : abg1}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the gamma function .",

    "each hydrogen has charge @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the fundamental unit of charge , and the oxygen has charge @xmath37 .",

    "we equilibrate all simulated state points to constant @xmath41 and @xmath42 by monitoring the pressure and internal energy .",
    "we control the temperature using the berendsen method of rescaling the velocities  @xcite , while the reaction field technique with a cutoff of 0.79 nm  @xcite accounts for the long - range coulombic interactions .",
    "the equations of motion evolve using the shake algorithm  @xcite with a time step of 1  fs , except at @xmath43 , where a time step of 2  fs is used due to the extremely slow motion of the molecules .",
    "equilibration times at high temperatures are relatively small . at low @xmath41 ,",
    "extremely long equilibration times are needed .",
    "the structural and thermodynamics properties may be obtained after relatively short equilibration times . however ,",
    "dynamic properties show significant aging effects ( i.e. dependence of measured properties on the chosen starting time ) if great care is not taken in equilibration .    for production runs",
    ", it is desirable to make measurements in the isoenergetic / isochoric ensemble ( nve ) .",
    "however , a small energy drift is unavoidable for the long runs presented here , so we again employ the heat bath of berendsen , using a relaxation time of 200ps  @xcite .",
    "the large relaxation time prevents an energy drift but achieves results that are very close to those that would be found if it were possible to perform a simulation in the nve ensemble .",
    "since we perform long runs for many state points , we store the molecular trajectories @xmath44 at logarithmic intervals to avoid storage problems that linear sampling presents . specifically , we sample configurations at times growing in powers of @xmath45 up a maximum time @xmath46 .",
    "we begin a new sampling cycle each time @xmath46 ( relative to the cycle starting time ) is reached .",
    "this sampling method allows for calculation of dynamic properties on time scales spanning eight orders of magnitude ( from 1  fs to 100  ns ) using a relatively small amount of disk space .",
    "still , more then 2 gb of storage was required for storing configurations at @xmath47 .",
    "our simulations have a speed of approximately 200 @xmath48s per update per molecule on a mips r10000 processor , representing a total calculation of approximately 8.4 years of cpu time , including the systems of 1728 molecules discussed in the appendix . for the larger systems , we utilize a parallelized version of our simulation code on eight processors to improve performance .",

    "the presence of a low-@xmath41 arrhenius regime in the st2 potential might be due to activated processes , that are expected to dominate the dynamics of fragile liquids below @xmath12 , as we observed for the spc / e potential .",
    "hence the st2 potential may provide an excellent opportunity to study these activated processes on a smaller time scale than is typically observed for most fragile liquids .",
