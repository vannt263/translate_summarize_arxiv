    "the jeans equations relate the gravitational potential of a galaxy to the kinematic poperties of the stars .",
    "this is an attractive way to infer the underlying mass , without the complexities of specifying a full phase space distribution function ( df ) . in this paper",
    ", we shall usually work with the second velocity moment tensor , which is just @xmath7 here , the subscript indices denote one of the orthogonal coordinate directions , and the angled brackets represent averaging over the phase space distribution function @xmath8 , whilst @xmath9 is the density ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the second velocity moment tensor is sometimes separated into contributions from streaming motion and random motion by defining the velocity dispersion tensor @xmath10 in the absence of streaming motions , the second moment tensor and the velocity dispersion tensor are identical .",
    "the second moment tensor is a symmetric second - rank tensor and so may always be diagonalized .",
    "the principal axes of the tensor then form an ellipsoid , which we shall call the second moment ellipsoid . in the absence of streaming motions ,",
    "this is just the velocity ellipsoid",
    ". this paper studies the alignment of the second moment ellipsoid and its implications for the underlying gravitational potential .",
    "the jeans equations are the first - order moments of the collisionless boltzmann equation .",
    "they are three equations relating the six independent components of the second velocity moment tensor @xmath11 to the density and the potential .",
    "hence , the jeans equations can not uniquely determine the @xmath12 and some closure condition must be adopted .",
    "a common choice is the alignment of the second moment ellipsoid in some coordinate system , which reduces the number of independent variables from six to three ",
    "namely , the semiaxes of the ellipsoid .",
    "for example , @xcite provided an elegant way to solve the jeans equations , assuming alignment in the cylindrical polar coordinate system ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "these models  jeans anisotropic models or jam  have become widely used in analyses of integral field data on elliptical galaxies  ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as studies of nuclear clusters  @xcite and lensing galaxies  @xcite .",
    "cylindrically aligned solutions with two of the semiaxes equal ( i.e. , @xmath14 ) are generated by dfs depending on the two isolating integrals , energy @xmath15 and angular momentum component @xmath16  @xcite . when all three semiaxes are different , the validity of the jam solutions remains unclear .",
    "in fact , @xcite has already questioned whether construction of numerical dfs for models with such properties is possible .",
    "alignment in the spherical polar coordinate system @xmath17 ) is also often used in the jeans equations .",
    "if two of the semiaxes are equal ( i.e. , @xmath18 ) , then the spherical aligned solutions can be generated by dfs depending on the two integrals , energy @xmath15 and square of the angular momentum @xmath19 . assuming a spherical density and potential ,",
    "this ansatz is very popular as the jeans equations then reduce to a single equation for the radial velocity dispersion @xmath20 together with an anisotropy parameter @xmath21 @xmath22 given a choice for @xmath21 , the only non - trivial jeans equations can be straightforwardly solved using an integrating factor ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "algorithms for solution of the jeans equations using spherical alignment but flattened densities and potentials have also been developed ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "these can in general have three different principal axes @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 and so the second moment ellipsoid is triaxial , but whether they can be realised by physical ( non - negative )",
    "dfs remains unclear .",
    "alignment in spheroidal coordinates ( @xmath26 ) has also been studied .",
    "this coordinate system is described in , for example , @xcite or @xcite . within the foci of the coordinate system ,",
    "spheroidal alignment approaches cylindrical , whilst at large radii , it tends to spherical .",
    "spheroidal alignment can therefore be viewed as interpolating between these two more familiar cases .",
    "it has long been known that if the gravitational potential is of stckel or separable form , then the second moment ellipsoid is aligned in spheroidal coordinates  ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the assumption that the ellipsoid is aligned in spheroidal coordinates can be made without a separable potential  @xcite .",
    "in fact , this makes good sense , as models of axisymmetric galaxies using numerical constructed dfs do suggest the alignment may be close to spheroidal  ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "intuitively , for systems like the stellar halo of the milky way , the potential in the inner parts is controlled by the flattened disk and bulge , in the outer parts by the rounder dark matter halo , and so again an alignment in spheroidal coordinates does seems very natural .",
    "spheroidal coordinates are the axisymmetric limit of ellipsoidal coordinates @xmath27 ) .",
    "for triaxial stckel models , @xcite already knew that the second velocity moment ellipsoid is aligned in ellipsoidal coordinates .",
    "the triaxial jeans equations for such stckel systems have been studied sporadically  @xcite . given the density and potential , the jeans equations are now three coupled first - order partial differential equations for three unknowns , namely @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "both the prescription of appropriate boundary conditions and the solution of the equations is challenging .",
    "only very few general triaxial dfs have ever been numerically constructed .",
    "the few such models available do show approximate alignment in ellipsoidal coordinates  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "our intention in this paper is to examine what may be legitimately deduced about the underlying gravitational potential from the alignment of the second velocity moment ellipsoid .",
    "this is motivated by arguments of @xcite who claim that : `` if a steady state stellar population has a triaxial velocity dispersion tensor whose eigenvectors are everywhere aligned in spherical polar coordinates , then the underlying gravitational potential must be spherically symmetric '' . this theorem will be examined , slightly corrected , and then extended below .",
    "this argument was queried by @xcite , who created a torus - based model of the galaxy that , at locations above the plane of the milky way , possessed a spherically aligned velocity dispersion tensor , even though the potential was highly flattened .",
    "although @xcite did not provide an explicit counter - example to the theorem of @xcite , they did question whether in general the potential does control the tilt . in their numerically constructed example , they argued that the tilt of the second velocity moment ellipsoid is controlled at least as much by the weightings of orbits , and hence the df , as compared to the potential . in this respect , @xcite conjectured that insights from separable or stckel models may not tell the whole story .",
    "one of the aims of this paper is to resolve the tension between these two viewpoints .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "section 2 studies the one spheroidal system for which there is hard data on the alignment ",
    "namely , the stellar halo of the milky way galaxy . for elliptical galaxies ,",
    "evidence on the alignment is necessarily much more indirect , as only the line of sight velocity distribution can be measured .",
    "we confirm , and sharpen , the results of @xcite and @xcite that the velocity ellipsoid of stars in the milky way stellar halo is close to spherical or spheroidal alignment .",
    "section 3 is theoretical and examines the case of exact spherical alignment .",
    "we prove under quite general conditions that the gravitational potential must be of separable or stckel form in spherical polars .",
    "this is an elaboration of the original theorem of @xcite .",
    "the only exceptions are simpler cases in which the second velocity moment ellipsoid has either two axes the same and so is a spheroid , or three axes the same and so is a sphere .",
    "section 4 discusses cylindrical and spheroidal alignment , and demonstrates , for the first time , that the assumption of alignment of the ( assumed triaxial ) second velocity moment tensor implies separability of the hamilton - jacobi equation in these coordinates . the converse result  that the separable or stckel potentials generate",
    "galaxy models in which the second velocity moment tensor is aligned along the separable coordinate system  has been known for some time and is implicit in eddington s early work  @xcite .",
    "lastly , section 5 builds models of stellar haloes in which the second velocity moment tensor is close to , but not exactly , spherically aligned and tests whether results remain valid in this approximate regime .",
    "we show that it is possible to build haloes in flattened potentials in which the velocity ellipsoid is close to spherical alignment over substantial portions of configuration space , though not everywhere .",
    "however , the more the potential is flattened , the greater is the magnitude and extent of the misalignment .",
    "the study of the kinematics of stars in the milky way halo has been revolutionized by high quality data derived from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "line of sight velocities are extracted from sdss spectroscopy .",
    "proper motions are derived from either multi - epoch sdss photometry in stripe 82  @xcite or from matches to archival schmidt photographic - plate based catalogues  @xcite .",
    "so , all three components of velocities are now available for thousands of halo stars , together with positions and photometric parallaxes .",
    "@xcite constructed a sample of halo subdwarfs using a reduced proper motion diagram , utilizing the light - motion catalog for stripe 82 @xcite .",
    "they extracted a clean sample of 1,782 halo stars , lying at galactocentric cylindrical polar radii between 7 and 10 kpc , and at depths of 4.5 kpc or less below the galactic plane .",
    "they found the first velocity moments to be consistent with zero to within the statistical error  see table 2 of @xcite .",
    "so , the second velocity moments ( @xmath30 ) are equivalent to the velocity dispersions ( @xmath31 ) , which we use henceforth in this section .",
    "they also found that the velocity ellipsoid of the halo stars is aligned with the spherical polar coordinate system , with the long axis pointing towards the galactic centre .",
    "the halo stars are strongly radially anisotropic .",
    "the semiaxes of the velocity ellipsoid are ( @xmath32 ) kms@xmath33 , which corresponds to an anisotropy parameter @xmath34 of 0.69 .",
    "they also noted a tentative asymmetry in the @xmath35 distribution , but found the @xmath36 and @xmath37 distributions symmetric .",
    "this conclusion was reinforced by the larger sample of @xcite . here , halo stars are extracted from the sdss data by combined colour and metallicity cuts ( specifically @xmath38 and [ fe / h ] @xmath39 ) . requiring the stars possess sdss spectra for radial velocities and poss astrometry for proper motions yields a large sample of @xmath1 halo stars , with an estimated contamination of @xmath40 per cent .",
    "@xcite found that the shape of the velocity ellipsoid is invariant in spherical coordinates within the volume probed by sdss and aligned in spherical polar coordinates ( their figures 12 and 13 ) .",
    "they found no statistically significant tilt from spherical alignment , with deviations modest and ranging between @xmath41 to @xmath42 .",
    "note that this sample extends over galactocentric cylindrical polar radii @xmath43 kpc and height above the galactic plane @xmath44 kpc , and so is much more extensive than earlier work . nonetheless , the semiaxes of the velocity ellipsoid are ( @xmath45 ) kms@xmath33 , in very good agreement with @xcite .",
    "bond et al s error bars also include systematic effects such as errors in the photometric parallaxes , whereas smith et al s do not .",
    "very recently , @xcite have examined a still larger sample of halo stars with galactocentric radii between 6 and 30 kpc .",
    "this contains blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) and halo f stars extracted from sdss , as well as a sample of still more distant f stars obtained from hectospec on the mmt .",
    "although only line of sight velocities are available , this still can yield constraints on the alignment , as there are different contributions from both radial and tangential velocities in different directions on the sky",
    ". @xcite find the alignment of the velocity ellipsoid of their halo sample to be close to spherical , albeit to within quite large uncertainties .      here , we will re - analyse the data of @xcite .",
    "we first discuss how the errors on the observable quantities propagate through to the alignment .",
    "the errors on the radial velocities are computed by the sdss pipeline , to which should be added a systematic error of between 2 kms@xmath33 ( optimistic ) and 6 kms@xmath33 ( pessimistic ) .",
    "the proper - motion errors are discussed in @xcite , who suggest using a fixed value of 0.6 mas yr@xmath33 .",
    "we assume that there is zero covariance between the two proper - motion components .",
    "the sdss pipeline provides photometric errors , which can be used to compute random errors in absolute magnitude ( assuming that the inter - band covariances are negligible ) .",
    "polynomial relations for the absolute magnitude of f and g stars as a function of @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and metallicity [ fe / h ] are given in @xcite .",
    "we then use monte carlo methods to gain an estimate of the random error in the absolute magnitude , given the errors in @xmath46,@xmath47,@xmath48 and [ fe / h ] , and add 0.1 mag in quadrature to account for systematics .",
    "given the estimates of error in the absolute magnitude ( with systematics included ) , we use monte carlo methods to estimate the error on the distances of each star in the sample .    to extract the halo sample ,",
    "we apply the cuts @xmath49 and @xmath50 [ fe / h ] @xmath39 to the data .",
    "we then restrict ourselves to stars that are found in the volume @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "this gives us a final sample of 7418 stars ( 5006 above the plane and 2412 below ) .",
    "figure [ fig : sdssveldists ] depicts the velocity distributions of our samples . just through visual inspection ,",
    "it is clear that the velocity ellipsoid can not be aligned with cylindrical coordinates , as the @xmath53 distribution has a noticeable tilt .",
    "the green dashed lines in the plot are at an angle @xmath54 , the direction that the long axis of the distribution should point if spherical alignment is satisfied . by eye",
    ", the tilt of the velocity distributions seems to be in good agreement with spherical alignment .",
    "this motivates a quantitative analysis of the data .",
    "given three orthogonal velocity components , @xmath55 , the tilt angle , @xmath56 , is the angle between the @xmath48-axis and the major axis of the ellipse formed by projecting the three dimensional velocity ellipsoid onto the @xmath57-plane ( see e.g. , @xcite or appendix a of @xcite ) . @xmath58 our aim is to diagnose the degree of misalignment in the data .",
    "we do so by using a probabilistic method and a simple model of the velocity distributions in some coordinate system .",
    "we split the data into six annular bins in @xmath59 .",
    "each bin spans the whole range of @xmath60 .",
    "there are three bins above the plane and three below it  in all cases the vertical range is @xmath61 .",
    "we then split the data in to three equally spaced radial bins within the range @xmath62 . within each bin , we make the simplifying assumption that the density distribution in uniform , so that @xmath63 we then model the velocity distribution in each bin as a 3dimensional normal distribution in the three relevant ( orthogonal ) velocity components @xmath55 . here",
    "we focus on the spherical and prolate spheroidal cases .",
    "the normal distribution has mean @xmath64 and covariance matrix @xmath65 where @xmath66 are the velocity dispersions and @xmath67 are the misalignment angles as previously defined , and the matrix is by construction symmetric .",
    "the parameters of the model ( per bin ) are then @xmath68 . we then compute the likelihood for individual stars within a given bin as @xmath69 where @xmath70 .",
    "we assume gaussian errors in the data , with some covariance matrix @xmath71 that is diagonal  which is tantamount to assuming that errors on the observed quantities are not correlated .",
    "thus , @xmath72 is a 6dimensional normal distribution with a diagonal covariance matrix , although in practise we assume that the measurements of @xmath73 and @xmath74 are error  free .",
    "our model is expressed in the coordinate system given by @xmath75 @xmath76 which is related to the distribution @xmath77 by the jacobian factor @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the cylindrical @xmath80 coordinate expressed in terms of the line  of  sight distance and galactic longitude and latitude .",
    "thus the final expression for the likelihood of an individual star in a given bin is @xmath81 in order to approximate this likelihood , we draw @xmath82 samples from the error ellipsoids of each star ( i.e. we sample the distribution @xmath83 this is done for @xmath84 per star and the total likelihood is the product of equation ( [ eq : approxlikelihood ] ) for every star in the bin .",
    "the log  likelihood is explored using the emcee ensemble sampler @xcite , implemented in python . in the end , we infer 9 parameters for each of our 6 spatial bins ( 3 mean velocities , 3 velocity dispersions and 3 misalignment angles ) .",
    "our priors are uninformative , so that @xmath85 and @xmath86 .      [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,^ \" , ]     table [ table : parameter_inferences ] gives the inferred values of the model parameters in each of our bins , as well as the @xmath87 confidence intervals . in general , we detect no strong correlations between any of the parameters  as an example , figure [ fig : triangleplot ] shows the one and two  dimensional projections of the posterior probability distribution in one of our bins .",
    "we find that the misalignment angles are small , and that the velocity dispersions obey @xmath88  consistent with a radially biased , flattened stellar halo .",
    "figure [ fig : alphas ] gives the one  dimensional marginalised distributions on the misalignment angles in each of our bins , and figure [ fig : beta ] is the same but for the anisotropy parameter .",
    "the overall picture is of an extremely radially biased population , with @xmath89 almost invariant over the whole volume that we probe , and velocity distributions that are close to spherically aligned  consistent with the findings of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the inferred misalignment angles are usually @xmath90 with uncertainties of a similar size , although there are a few cases where the misalignment is much larger .",
    "the most discrepant case is the bin with edges @xmath91 and @xmath92 , where @xmath93 .",
    "curiously , this bin is also the only of the six where @xmath94 , which is perhaps suggestive that the contamination from either substructure or the thick disc is more significant in this bin .",
    "we infer non  zero first ",
    "order moments in each of the velocity components . in the following sections",
    ", we shall see that the assumption of symmetry about @xmath95 is necessary to relate the orientation of the velocity ellipsoids to properties of the matter distribution .",
    "although it is the case that the first moments are often discrepant with zero at the one ( or sometimes two ) sigma level through inspection of the monte ",
    "carlo samples of posterior distributions , we do not believe that the results are truly significant .",
    "the first  order moments will be the most severely affected of our parameters by incorrect assumptions about the circular velocity at the solar position , as well as the velocity of the sun with respect to the lsr . in all of our analysis , we used the same values for these velocities as in @xcite , and so uncertainties on them are not reflected in our posterior distributions .",
    "given the fact that the first moments we infer are always @xmath96 or smaller , it is highly plausible that incorporating uncertainty on the circular speed and solar motion could account for these discrepancies from zero .",
    "another coordinate system of interest is the prolate spheroidal system @xmath97 , often used in modelling oblate mass models  ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these coordinates ( which are discussed in greater detail in section [ sec : spheroidalign ] ) are related to cylindrical polars via the set of equations @xmath98 surfaces of constant @xmath99 are hyperbolic sheets , whereas surfaces of constant @xmath100 are prolate ellipsoids .",
    "the quantity @xmath101 is called the _",
    "focal distance_. at large distances from the origin , these surfaces begin to coincide with spherical polar coordinates ( @xmath102 and @xmath103 ) , whereas at small distances the coordinate surfaces align with cylindrical polars ( @xmath104 and @xmath105 ) . in order to compute properties of the velocity distributions",
    ", we must also express the velocities in this coordinate system .",
    "these are related to the cylindrical velocities via @xmath106 since there is a free parameter associated with this coordinate system , @xmath101 , there are many possible different orientations of the velocity ellipsoids . in order to decide upon a value of @xmath101 that gives the smallest misalignment angles in the distribution of @xmath107 , we employ a method identical to that described above , save for three differences .",
    "we do not bin the data in this case , but instead simply model the velocity distribution as invariant across the entire volume .",
    "we assume that this distribution has zero mean ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "we also alter the covariance matrix @xmath109 so that it now reads @xmath110 this is done because we are aiming for a value of @xmath101 that minimizes misalignment , so our model is of a velocity distribution that has @xmath111  this assumption provides the constraint on @xmath101 . in this case , then , the model parameters are @xmath112 . if we were to bin the data , we would infer four parameters per bin , leading to a total of 24 parameters . by not binning the data ,",
    "we reduce our parameter space to 4 dimensions , which takes significantly less computational time to sample . despite our rather crude assumption that the velocity distribution is invariant in the volume we are studying",
    ", we expect this analysis to give a decent estimate of the focal distance that reduces misalignment .",
    "again , we use emcee to do the sampling , with uninformative priors that simply ensure that all four of the model parameters are greater than zero .",
    "figure [ fig : triangleplot_delta ] depicts the posterior probability distributions on the four parameters of the model .",
    "in particular , it is clear that the data favours coordinate systems that have a small focal distance ",
    "we infer @xmath113 . in this limit ,",
    "the prolate spheroidal coordinates coincide with spherical polars . the data ,",
    "then , suggest that the extra degree of freedom provided by the prolate spheroidal coordinates does not produce better alignment of the velocity ellipsoid .     and the velocity dispersions of the data .",
    "one can see that small foci are favoured , so that the spheroidal coordinate system essentially coincides with spherical polar coordinates . ]",
    "motivated by our analysis of the stellar halo , let us assume that the second velocity moment ellipsoid is aligned with the spherical polar coordinate system .",
    "this means that all the cross terms @xmath114 vanish .",
    "the df depends on phase space coordinates and so may have the completely general form @xmath115 .",
    "however , the df is an integral of motion by jeans theorem , and so the poisson bracket @xmath116 must vanish . under time reversal ,",
    "integrals of motion remain integrals of motion , so the poisson bracket @xmath117 must also vanish .",
    "therefore , we can always construct the even function @xmath118 $ ] , which must depend on even powers of the velocities .",
    "this is of course just the even part of the df .",
    "the even part of the df may contain terms like @xmath119 provided @xmath120 is itself even .",
    "however , the cross - terms @xmath121 must all vanish at every position . on the grounds of naturalness",
    ", we expect that the df must be of form @xmath122 and so it must depend only on even powers of the velocity components in the aligned coordinate system .",
    "this is a key step in the proof , though the condition can be recast in terms of the fourth velocity moments , albeit with some effort  @xcite .",
    "however , here we can appeal directly to the data  we have shown in the preceding section that the mean motions of velocity distributions of the stellar halo are consistent with zero in almost every bin .",
    "the velocity distributions are symmetric to a good approximation under the transformations @xmath123 or @xmath124 or @xmath125 ( see e.g. , fig .  [",
    "fig : sdssveldists ] ) . in other words , without changing the underlying potential , we can always construct the even part of the df , which must depend on even powers only of the individual velocity components .",
    "@xcite reached the same conclusion that the df may be chosen to depend only on even powers , but their line of reasoning was incorrect .    introducing canonically conjugate momenta @xmath126 , @xmath127 and @xmath128  @xcite ,",
    "then the hamiltonian is @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the gravitational potential . without loss of generality",
    ", the df can now be recast as @xmath131 by using the hamiltonian to eliminate @xmath132 .",
    "the poisson bracket @xmath133 must vanish .",
    "the @xmath134 in the df may be treated as a constant when evaluating the derivatives in the poisson bracket , yielding : @xmath135 the first term is antisymmetric in @xmath136 , whereas all other terms are symmetric .",
    "so , it must be the case that @xmath137 does not depend on @xmath47 .",
    "( this is analogous to the elimination of the nodes in the n - body problem which similarly reduces the order of the system in phase space by two  see e.g. , @xcite . )",
    "we now multiply by @xmath138 and differentiate with respect to @xmath47 at constant @xmath139 to obtain : @xmath140 the first term is odd with respect to @xmath141 , the second term odd with respect to @xmath142",
    ". however , the equation must remain true under @xmath143 or @xmath144 , and so each term must separately vanish .",
    "there are four possibilities  either ( case i ) @xmath145 or case ( ii ) @xmath146 or case ( iii ) @xmath147 or case ( iv ) @xmath148 cases ( i)-(iii ) lead to the degenerate cases in which two or three of the semiaxes of the second velocity moment ellipsoid are the same .",
    "for example , case ( i ) tells us that @xmath137 is independent of both @xmath141 and @xmath142 . on returning to eq  ( [ eq : sphpolp ] )",
    ", we see that it also follows that @xmath137 is independent of the conjugate coordinates @xmath149 and @xmath60 as well , leaving us with @xmath150 , or solutions with completely isotropic velocity ellipsoids .",
    "the other degenerate cases are when the df is given by @xmath151 in a spherical potential , or @xmath152 in an axisymmetric potential . here",
    ", @xmath153 is the angular momentum , whilst @xmath16 is the component of @xmath153 that is parallel to the symmetry axis .",
    "both lead to the second velocity moment ellipsoid possessing axial symmetry  in the former case with @xmath18 , in the latter case with @xmath154 .",
    "these models have been known since at least the adams prize essay of james jeans ( 1919 ) .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    ". therefore , the degenerate instances of spherical alignment do not seem to apply to the case of the milky way stellar halo anyhow .",
    "only case ( iv ) survives .",
    "the solution to @xmath156 is @xmath157 where @xmath158 and @xmath159 are arbitrary functions of the indicated arguments .",

    ", we obtain the result @xmath166 where @xmath167 and @xmath168 is an arbitrary function .",
    "so , the radial coordinate separates from the other coordinates .",
    "this means that there is an additional integral of the motion by separation of the hamilton - jacobi equation : @xmath169 so , we can additionally replace @xmath170 with @xmath171 in the df , which means that @xmath172 . taking the poisson bracket and exploiting the fact that both @xmath134 and @xmath171 may be taken as constants during the differentiation ,",
    "we deduce that @xmath137 must now be independent of both @xmath47 and @xmath149 , and so are just left with @xmath173 multiplying through by @xmath174 and differentiating with respect to @xmath149 gives @xmath175 inserting eq .",

    "this is the result claimed by @xcite ; namely , that if the second velocity moment ellipsoid is aligned everywhere in spherical polar coordinates , then the only non - singular potential is spherically symmetric .",
    "it is worth emphasizing the very general nature of the assumptions required to deduce the result . _",
    "nothing about the quadratic nature of the integrals or the separability of the underlying potential has been assumed .",

    "@xcite assumed that @xmath179 implies that the df depends on @xmath180 .",
    "this though is not necessarily true .",
    "note too that for the purposes of the theorem it is immaterial whether the population self - consistently generates the gravitational field or not .",

    "although this material has been placed in an appendix as it is somewhat mathematical , nonetheless we regard it as a more powerful proof of eddington s ( 1915 ) theorem which does not rest on the so - called `` ellipsoidal hypothesis '' , namely the assumption that the df depends on a single quadratic function of the velocities ( see e.g. @xcite and @xcite for later work on the ellipsoidal hypothesis ) .",

    "the @xmath82-body simulation is evolved whilst each particle weight @xmath265 is adjusted according to a first - order differential equation that maximises the merit function @xmath266 .",
    "one difficulty encountered by @xcite is that the cost function naturally fluctuates as the simulation is evolved due to poisson noise , so some form of smoothing is required to ensure the algorithm converges .",
    "d09 pointed out that @xcite s method of simply averaging the model properties used in the cost function did not ensure the model converged , so d09 instead proposed smoothing the merit function @xmath266 by making the weight - adjustment equation a second - order differential equation .",
    "several other improvements to the original algorithm were presented by d09 . in his formulation    each particle is evolved on its own dynamical timescale such that the outer parts of the model converge as rapidly as the inner regions ,    a total weight constraint is included as part of the merit function and    the particles are resampled when the ratio between the minimum and maximum weight ( normalized with respect to the priors ) exceeds a chosen value    .",
    "the last of these is implemented by , every so often , drawing new particles from the original set with probability proportional to their prior - normalized weights and adding a random velocity offset with a magnitude that declines exponentially as a function of the simulation time . for the model",
    "presented below we use very similar parameters for the algorithm as those presented in d09 .    using the made - to - measure method",

    "the separable potentials in spherical polars @xmath347 were introduced into stellar dynamics by eddington .",

    "however , this is not the case , as the awkwardness can be avoided by requiring the non - spherical part of the density to fall like @xmath352 only outside the central region .",

    "orbits whose pericenters satisfy @xmath372 lie within rectangular toroids and have three exact integrals of motion .",

    "surfaces of constant @xmath100 , @xmath99 and @xmath376 are confocal ellipsoids , one - sheeted hyperboloids and two - sheeted hyperboloids respectively .",
    "the coordinate system is illustrated in e.g. , @xcite , @xcite or @xcite .",
    "we start by assuming that the second velocity moment ellipsoid is diagonalised in confocal ellipsoidal coordinates , so that all the cross - terms @xmath377 , @xmath378 and @xmath379 all vanish .",
    "the hamiltonian is : @xmath380 where @xmath381 , @xmath382 and @xmath383 are canonical momenta .",
    "again , as the hamiltonian is time - invariant , we can always construct the even part of the df and assume that it depends on the squares of the canonical momenta only .",
    "for the cross - terms to vanish in ellipsoidal coordinates , this means @xmath384 . using the hamiltonian to eliminate @xmath249 without loss of generality ,",
    "we obtain @xmath385 .",

    "now , take the first equation , multiply by @xmath394 and differentiate with respect to @xmath100 .",
    "we already know that @xmath137 is independent of @xmath100 and that @xmath134 may be treated as a constant , so this operator annihilates all terms bar the one containing the potential and leaves us with @xmath395 similarly , multiplying the second equation by @xmath396 and differentiating with respect to @xmath100 leaves us with @xmath397 we could of course have started by eliminating @xmath398 in terms of the hamiltonian , and repeating our steps would yield @xmath399 this gives us three partial differential equations that the potential must satisfy , and it is straightforward to integrate them up to establish @xmath400 where @xmath254 , @xmath255 and @xmath401 are arbitrary functions of the indicated arguments .",
    "this is the separable or stckel potential in confocal ellipsoidal coordinates .",
    "rather than demonstrating the theorem for each alignment separately , a more mathematical  but abstract ",
    "approach is to derive all possible coordinate systems and gravitational potentials together .",
    "this is similar in spirit to the original investigations of @xcite and @xcite .    here",
    ", we prove the following theorem ( see also an & evans 2015 ) : _ suppose that ( i ) the second velocity moment tensor of a stellar system is aligned in an orthogonal curvilinear coordinate system and has ( in general ) three unequal axes and that ( ii ) the stellar system is in a steady state , so that the even part of the distribution function ( df ) satisfies the collisionless boltzmann equation and ( iii ) the df is invariant under reversal of the sign of each velocity component .",
    "then , it necessarily follows that the coordinate system is the confocal ellipsoidal coordinates ( or one of its limiting cases ) and that the gravitational potential is of separable or stckel form .",
    "_    consider a system with 3 degrees of freedom governed by the hamiltonian of the form of @xmath402 where ( @xmath403 ) are orthogonal curvilinear coordinates , ( @xmath404 ) are the corresponding canonical momenta and @xmath405 are the scale factors .",
    "suppose that the system admits an integral of motion of the form , @xmath406 which is recognised as the even part of the df .",
    "the vanishing of the poisson bracket requires @xmath407 however , both @xmath134 and @xmath137 are invariant under @xmath408 for any @xmath409 s , and so it follows that , for @xmath410 , @xmath411 here note that , for any @xmath48 and @xmath409 , @xmath412 then the integrability condition on @xmath137 is @xmath413 which results in @xmath414 here , @xmath415 is the linear second - order differential operator acting on a function @xmath416 , defined as @xmath417 which is symmetric for @xmath418 , i.e.  @xmath419 .",
    "in other words , if there exists an integral @xmath137 , we must have @xmath420 or @xmath421 for any pair of indices @xmath48 and @xmath409 . the @xmath420 ( for @xmath422 )",
    "case however implies that the integral @xmath137 becomes invariant under the rotation within @xmath423-@xmath424 plane and so the distribution must be isotropic within @xmath425-@xmath426 plane : that is to say , the resulting second velocity moments must be degenerate as in @xmath427 .",
    "if @xmath428 on the other hand , we must have @xmath429 the condition on the scale factors @xmath430 for all @xmath422 ( and any @xmath431 ) is the same condition defining the stckel systems . the most general orthogonal curvilinear coordinate in a euclidean space that satisfies",
    "the condition is the confocal ellipsoidal coordinates .",
    "this encompasses the 11 3-d quadric coordinates in which the helmholtz equation separates  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the general solution of @xmath432 in the confocal ellipsoidal coordinates ( or its degenerate limit ) is known to be @xmath433 where @xmath434 is an arbitrary function of the coordinate component @xmath435 alone .",
    "the condition @xmath432 is really the integrability condition on the system of the quasi - linear partial differential equations . if we suppose the existence of the set of functions @xmath436 such that @xmath433 ,",
    "then @xmath437 where @xmath438 is the kronecker delta .",
    "this is the system of partial differential equations on @xmath439 , whose compatibility condition implies that @xmath440 for any @xmath441 .",
    "the only non - trivial conditions among these are @xmath442=0 \\quad\\text{(for any $ i\\ne j$)},\\ ] ] and so , given the stckel coordinate satisfying @xmath443 , we find that @xmath432 is the necessary condition for existence of the solution set @xmath444 .",
    "moreover , thanks to the frobenius theorem , the condition is also sufficient for ( local ) existence of such a solution set . in other words , @xmath445 is also in fact the general solution of @xmath432 .",
    "a consequence of this theorem is that it seems to imply that the only axisymmetric equilibria with dfs are either ( i ) jeans models with @xmath446 in which two of the semi - axes of the second moment tensor are the same or ( ii ) stckel or separable models in spheroidal coordiantes with all three semiaxes different .",
    "this seems to cast doubt on the existence of axisymetric equilibria constructed by schwarzschild modelling  ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". however , the likely resolution of this paradox is that the only regular orbits observing the required symmetry are those in separable potentials , and so the velocity distributions resulting from a schwarzschild model in a non - separable potential are not strictly symmetric ."
