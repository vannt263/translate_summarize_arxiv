    ", can be corrected . in a previous article @xcite , we showed how elementary transformations of data could generate truly concave patterns .",
    "this was obtained by an analysis of the table of second differences between binding energies , then by a removal of pairing energy , and finally by an _",
    "ad hoc _ , but minimal , parabolic term added to nuclear energies , if necessary .",
    "concavity is also a property of several thermodynamical functions .",
    "an extension of the analysis at zero temperature @xcite to a finite temperature theory is in order .",
    "this extension is the main subject of the present paper . for the sake of simplicity",
    "this paper , like @xcite , considers only sequences of isotopes and , thus , takes advantage of concavity with respect to @xmath5 only ; @xmath6 is frozen .",
    "a generalization to concavity with respect to both @xmath5 and @xmath6 is left to future work .    in sec .",
    "ii we briefly recall the method , explained in @xcite , for the tuning of actual experimental data into concave patterns . in sec .",

    "other thermodynamical functions will also be considered , and their concavity will be tested .",
    "bounds will be found , and an error bar for predictions will be estimated .",
    "section iv contains a brief discussion of the problems raised by extrapolations of concave functions . a discussion and conclusion are given in sec .",
    "our argument is illustrated numerically , by using a sequence of isotopic ground - state binding energies , @xmath20 consider the table from @xmath21sn to @xmath22sn , studied in @xcite at zero temperature , because we later want to extend it at finite temperature by including the energies of excited states .",
    "it reads , in kev ,    \\{934562 , 942743 , 953529 , 961272 , 971571 , 979117 , 988680 , 995625 , 1004952 , 1011437 . 1020544 , 1026715 , 1035529 , 1041475 , 1049962 , 1055695 , 1063889 , 1069448 , 1077348 , 1082713 , 1090400 , 1095615 , 1102917 , 1105335 , 1109075 , 1111310 , 1115087 , 1117150}.",
    "it should be noted that such data come from refs .",
    "these sources often quote the binding energy per nucleon instead of the total binding energy itself and such values per nucleon are given to varying numbers of significant figures , from four to seven . consequently , even though we quote and use all our binding energies to six or seven significant figures , for consistency reasons and for ease of performing our calculations , our values are generally accurate only to the order of tens of kev .",
    "it must be understood that all energies stated in this paper are in units of kev .    despite a well known linear trend because of a `` not too much fluctuating average energy per nucleon '' ,",
    "this list of energies is far from making a smooth pattern .",
    "it is even less of a concave one .",
    "the sequence of @xmath23 second differences ( sds ) , @xmath24    \\{-2606 , 3043 , -2556 , 2753 , -2018 , 2619 , -2382 , 2841 , -2622 , 2937 , -2643 , 2868 , -2542 , 2755 , -2460 , 2634 , -2341 , 2535 , -2322 , 2473 , -2088 , 4885 , -1323 , 1506 , -1542 , 1714 } ,    gives estimates of the `` curvatures '' of the pattern .",
    "it is far from containing only positive numbers . on the contrary , its signs alternate , systematically .",
    "the wiggling between sd s centered at odd and even nuclei ( or staggering ) has , roughly speaking , a constant amplitude .",
    "( notice , however , the maximum sd , 4885 , due to the shell closure at @xmath25sn , and the weakening of the numbers beyond @xmath25sn . )    these alternating signs are obviously due to the gains of binding for even sn nuclei because of pairing .",
    "add to each _ even _ nucleus energy a fixed number , for example @xmath26 kev , to suppress the increase of binding due to pairing .",
    "the resulting list of sds is attenuated by an amount equal to @xmath27 and now reads ,    \\{-506 , 943 , -456 , 653 , 82 , 519 , -282 , 741 , -522 , 837 , -543 , 768 , -442 , 655 , -360 , 534 , -241 , 435 , -222 , 373 , 12 , 2785 , 777 , -594 , 558 , -386}.",
    "all numbers are now significantly smaller than their partners in the previous list of sd s , except for the `` spike '' at @xmath25sn .",
    "the latter is positive , and , hence causes no deviation from concavity .",
    "the interesting point is the most negative number in the list , namely @xmath28 kev .",
    "all negative curvatures can be converted into positive ones if we add to every energy an artificial , parabolic correction , which was chosen in @xcite as , @xmath29 with @xmath30 kev . incidentally ,",
    "the lowest point of the parabola is arbitrary , because sds will increase by just a constant , namely twice the coefficient @xmath31 of the @xmath32 term .",
    "hence , after such a @xmath33 kev shift , the previous sequence of sds becomes entirely positive ,    \\{94 , 1543 , 144 , 1253 , 682 , 1119 , 318 , 1341 , 78 , 1437 , 57 , 1368 , 158 , 1255 , 240 , 1134 , 359 , 1035 , 378 , 973 , 612 , 3385 , 1377 , 6 , 1158 , 214 } ,    in short , a `` concavity ensuring '' manipulation for the sn isotope energies consists in replacing each energy @xmath34 by @xmath35 + 300 \\times ( a-118)^2.$ ] this indeed creates a concave pattern .",
    "the list of such tuned energies , @xmath36 reads ,    \\{914312 , 928043 , 941679 , 953772 , 965721 , 976417 , 986430 , 995325 , 1003902 , 1011137 , 1018294 , 1024015 , 1029679 , 1033975 , 1038112 , 1040995 , 1043639 , 1045148 , 1046298 , 1046413 , 1046150 , 1044915 , 1043067 , 1037835 , 1031225 , 1024610 , 1016837 , 1008850}.    the choice of the two parameters , p=1050 kev and p=300 kev , is empirical : one must find a pairing correction leading to a minimal parabolic correction inducing concavity .",
    "other choices for @xmath37 are obviously possible .",
    "anyhow , such parameters must be readjusted for different regions of the table of nuclei .    when concavity is obtained , it is trivial to see that extrapolations from two points on the concave pattern allow predictions of lower bounds to nuclear energies . in the same way ,",
    "it is trivial that interpolations provide upper bounds .",
    "then , from such bounds for energies @xmath38 one recovers bounds , of strictly the same quality , for the physical energies @xmath39 this is obtained by subtracting from @xmath40 bounds their `` tuning terms '' .",
    "in @xcite we showed that the quality of such bounds is indeed good , and that interpolations and extrapolations from the raw , non concave pattern , are less satisfactory .",
    "but there is a more profound reason why a concave pattern is necessary .",
    "indeed , several thermodynamical functions , governed by theorems proving their concavity , have a notoriously singular limit at zero temperature : they become non analytical and are just piecewise continuous .",
    "their limit plots are made of segments ; derivatives are discontinuous at turning points .",
    "because of the staggering effect , the _ concave envelope _ of the raw pattern of @xmath34 would contain only the even isotopes .",
    "concavity is thus necessary for a theory which must accommodate both odd and even nuclei .",
    "the thermodynamical functions studied in the next section , sec .",
    "iii , therefore , preferably use concave energies @xmath41 and the corresponding excited state energies @xmath42",
    "consider the particle number operator @xmath43 and a familiar nuclear hamiltonian @xmath44 where @xmath45 @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the mass number , one - body kinetic energy and two - body interaction , respectively .",
    "nuclear data tables give precise values for a large number of lowest lying eigenvalues @xmath48 of @xmath49 for many nuclei .",
    "one may thus reasonably estimate the grand partition function , @xmath50 = \\sum_{na } ( 2 j_{na}+1 )   \\exp\\left [ \\beta \\left ( \\mu a - e_{na } \\right )   \\right ] , \\label{definz}\\ ] ] provided that i ) the temperature , @xmath51 is low enough to allow a truncation of the spectrum to include only those states provided by the tables and ii ) the chemical potential , @xmath52 selects mainly those nuclei in which we are interested .",
    "let @xmath53 denote , as usual , a statistical average .",
    "the ( equilibrium ! ) density operator in fock space , @xmath54,$ ] ensures that the following grand potential , @xmath55 is maximum in the space of many - body density matrices with unit trace , since , by definition , @xmath56 @xmath57 with the entropy , @xmath58 our use of a slightly non - traditional @xmath59 makes the upcoming proofs of concavity somewhat easier .",

    "thus , @xmath82 is a positive definite matrix . in other terms",

    ", we do not perform the full , double legendre transform .",
    "we rather retain an intermediate representation , with @xmath87 and either @xmath89 or @xmath90 we stay with real variables and functions .",
    "we can stress that , while @xmath43 has a discrete spectrum , conversely @xmath87 is continuous , a monotonically increasing function of @xmath52 smooth provided @xmath72 is finite .",
    "the monotonicity results from eq .",
    "( [ fluca ] ) .",
    "actually , at low temperatures , strong derivatives signal the onset of discrete jumps due to the integer spectrum of @xmath91 but we may stay away from this `` jumpy '' regime in the following , temporarily at least .",
    "anyhow , at any fixed , finite @xmath71 the smoothness and monotonicity of @xmath87 with respect to @xmath70 allows a reasonably easy numerical calculation of the inverse function @xmath92 a main argument of this section is thus , at fixed temperatures , to use @xmath87 as a continuous variable and attempt extrapolations towards unknown nuclei .    for this , given a fixed value of @xmath84 we keep track of @xmath87 and @xmath86 as functions of @xmath2 since the functional inversion from @xmath93 to @xmath94 is reasonably easy , we plot @xmath86 in terms of @xmath87 and can attempt an extrapolation for further values of @xmath4 this extrapolation can be considered as a candidate for a mass formula , at that finite temperature @xmath83    according to eq .",
    "( [ flucb ] ) , the average , constrained energy , @xmath95 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath90 furthermore , for negative chemical potentials @xmath70 at least , and more generally if @xmath67 has an upper bound , the operator , @xmath96 is bounded from below .",
    "therefore there is a convergence of the process consisting in i ) extrapolating with respect to @xmath70 both @xmath97 and @xmath87 for fixed values of @xmath71 then ii ) eliminating @xmath70 to generate the @xmath72-parametrized `` mass formula '' @xmath98 and finally iii ) considering the limit of this mass formula when @xmath99 alternately , it is equivalent , and maybe more efficient , to first eliminate @xmath70 and then extrapolate the `` mass formula '' @xmath98 first with respect to @xmath100 then with respect to @xmath90    are there concavity properties in this intermediate representation ?",
    "clearly , a simple legendre transform of @xmath101 with respect to @xmath70 only , returns a free energy , @xmath102 as a concave function of @xmath87 and @xmath83 if @xmath89 is low enough to allow the product @xmath103 to be neglected , then , at fixed @xmath84 one may accept that @xmath86 is an `` almost '' concave function of @xmath4 this assumption will be tested by the numerical results which follow .",
    "incidentally , a straightforward calculation yields , @xmath104 with a positive factor , @xmath105 this simplifies into @xmath106 if one uses the already defined , centered operator @xmath75 and the similarly centered operator @xmath107 from eqs .",
    "( [ secderi],[secderisimpl ] ) , concavity is unclear ; we shall have to test it numerically .",

    "if less than 10 are known , we calculate @xmath109 see eq .",
    "( [ definz ] ) . for those rare cases where the spin @xmath110 is ambiguous we choose the lowest of the suggested spins .",
    "if the spin is completely unknown , we set it to be either @xmath111 or @xmath112 , according to @xmath113 these tactics minimize the statistical influence of such rare cases . for a future independent treatment of the proton and neutron numbers",
    ", we actually use a neutron number operator @xmath114 rather than @xmath43 in eqs .",
    "( [ definz])-([secderi ] ) ; our chemical potential @xmath70 is truly for neutrons .",
    "however , for easier reading , the upcoming plots use @xmath115    the lower and upper curves in the left part of fig .",
    "1 are the plots of the function @xmath116 when @xmath117 kev and @xmath118 mev , respectively .",
    "the increase of @xmath86 when @xmath89 increases is transparent .",
    "note , however , that a lack of excited states in our data base beyond @xmath25sn weakens this temperature effect .",
    "also striking is the apparent concavity of both curves .",
    "it is found that the lower temperature , @xmath119 kev , is low enough to allow @xmath86 to run , in practice , through all the experimental energies for the _ even _ nuclei ; the function follows the _ concave envelope _ of the experimental pattern . for graphical convenience , fig .",
    "1 shows the plots for @xmath120 only , but the same observations hold for full plots , with @xmath121 as a test , we also calculated @xmath86 when the levels of @xmath25sn are omitted from the trace sum , eq .",
    "( [ definz ] ) , see the right part of fig .",
    "1 , where now the concave envelope goes through the dots representing two odd nuclei , @xmath122sn and @xmath123sn , and ignores the dot representing @xmath25sn .",
    "similar verifications of other concave envelopes were obtained by removing other nuclei when calculating @xmath124    then fig .",
    "2 shows what happens when one calculates a tuned partition function , @xmath125 and all resulting functions @xmath126",
    "@xmath127 @xmath128 etc . by using concave tuned energies , @xmath129 + 300 \\times ( a-118)^2.$ ] the dots in fig .",
    "2 now represent ground - state tuned energies ; hence , concave envelopes do not eliminate odd nuclei .",
    "now both even and odd nuclei can be accounted for by the function @xmath128 except , as shown by the right part of fig .",
    "2 , for those nuclei which have been voluntarily omitted from the trace , eq .",
    "( [ definz ] ) .    to verify whether concave envelopes and concavity result from negligible values of the entropy term in the free energy , or , more precisely , negligible values of its second derivative , a calculation of @xmath130 for bare data , and of its partner @xmath131 for tuned data , is in order . figure 3 shows decimal log plots of the ratio , @xmath132 as a function of @xmath100 for @xmath133 @xmath134 and @xmath135 kev , respectively . at the higher temperature , @xmath136 mev ,",
    "an approximately constant ratio is observed , except for edge effects at both ends of our data base .",
    "the almost constant ratio favors concavity .",
    "moreover , the ratio typically does not exceed @xmath137 .",
    "this is small , but might not be small enough , because then @xmath138 remains close to @xmath108 mev , the order of magnitude of @xmath139 a first difference and a binding energy per nucleon . for @xmath140 kev , the ratio becomes smaller , @xmath141 or less , but it acquires some structure , because of the low level density of @xmath25sn in particular .",
    "again lower ratios , smaller than @xmath142 are found for @xmath143 kev , but now with strong variations .",
    "it is clear that odd nuclei , because of their higher level density due to the absence of a pairing gap in their spectra , induce maxima . as a consequence of such strong variations , translating into strong first and second derivatives , it is not excluded that sds coming from @xmath138 might prevent @xmath144 from having the concavity property of the free energy , @xmath145 obviously , the same difficulty might arise with @xmath86 and its concave envelopes .",
    "we must therefore numerically calculate second derivatives , see eqs .",
    "( [ secderi],[secderisimpl ] ) .    the left part of fig .",
    "4 shows plots of the right - hand side of eqs . ( [ secderi],[secderisimpl ] ) , multiplied by @xmath146 this is for tuned data . the additional denominator , @xmath147 is omitted for graphical reasons .",
    "the upper full line represents the situation when @xmath148 mev ; the second derivative , @xmath149 remains positive and does so until @xmath150 kev , see the dashed line in the left - hand side of the figure . for lower temperatures , however , negative values appear . for instance , the lower full curve , corresponding to @xmath151 kev , indicates small , but definitely negative values between @xmath152sn and @xmath122sn .",
    "our numerical tests show that the occurrence of such negative , actually moderate , values for lower temperatures seems to be frequent , while not systematic .",
    "furthermore , such `` negativity accidents '' turn out to be worse if we use untuned data , for the obvious reason that the untuned data lacked concavity in the first place .",
    "a possible reason for the negativity accidents with tuned data might be that the fluctuation of @xmath43 is not large enough to justify our use of @xmath153 as a continuous variable .",
    "since it interpolates between integers , a fluctuation of order @xmath154 or at least @xmath155 might be necessary . as shown by the three plots in the right part of fig .",
    "4 , corresponding to @xmath156 @xmath157 and @xmath158 kev from the upper to the lower plots , respectively , a minimum temperature is needed to avoid too small a fluctuation of the particle number .",
    "furthermore , the low level density in @xmath25sn obviously reinforces a reduction of fluctuations and the small sds obtained by us in the tuned pattern of ground - state energies allow localized deviations of concavity .",
    "the deviations are too weak to appear on fig .",
    "2 , however .    at this stage ,",
    "the situation can be summarized as follows . on the one hand ,",
    "the tuned pattern of experimental energies shows concavity , but the concavity of @xmath144 as a function of @xmath153 is not sure , although it seems to occur most of the time . on the other hand",
    ", we have a theorem proving concavity for the free energy , either @xmath159 or @xmath160 as functions of @xmath89 and @xmath87 or @xmath127 respectively .",
    "for instance , elementary derivations show that , in that representation where @xmath87 ( or @xmath153 ) and @xmath72 are the primary variables , @xmath161 the removal of the entropy term , leading from the free energy to the energy , can destroy the concavity , somewhat weakly .",
    "we are not much interested in @xmath162 because , as stated earlier , its concavity skips odd nuclei .",
    "thus , the remainder of this section will consider @xmath163 at fixed @xmath84 and we shall assume that @xmath89 is low enough to make @xmath164 small with respect to @xmath165 this approximation can be verified later , in due time . our rationale will be that @xmath128 even though it might deviate from concavity , will stay close enough to the concave @xmath166 their difference , @xmath167 a positive quantity , will define an error bar between a lower bound @xmath168 and an upper bound @xmath144 for ground - state energies .    consider fig .",
    "the dots represent the ground - state tuned energies , the upper full curve is the plot of @xmath169 when @xmath148 mev , and the lower dashed curve is the plot of @xmath170 at the same temperature .",
    "there is no need to stress that two such curves make a band defining upper and lower bounds for the experimental energies .",
    "moreover , a similar , but narrower band is obtained if @xmath89 decreases . the lower full curve and",
    "the upper dashed one in fig .",
    "5 represent @xmath144 and @xmath163 respectively , for @xmath171 kev .",
    "the following properties , i ) the average energy and the free energy are increasing and decreasing , respectively , functions of @xmath84 ii ) the energy is larger than the free energy and iii ) the entropy term by which they differ vanishes when @xmath89 vanishes , are not big surprises .",
    "it can be concluded that , in so far as thermodynamical functions can be calculated at low enough temperatures , precise `` accuracy bands '' may be available .",
    "their , hopefully analytic , continuation for higher and/or lower values of @xmath67 than those available in nuclear data tables provides a scheme making predictions for exotic nuclei .",
    "an estimate of the entropy term is now useful . given @xmath70 and a _",
    "@xmath71 let @xmath172 and @xmath173 correspond to that nucleus whose ground - state energy maximizes the exponential , @xmath174.$ ] consider now the first subdominant exponential .",
    "it might be generated by the first excited state of the same nucleus , or by the ground - state of one of its neighbors .",
    "let @xmath175 and @xmath176 be its parameters and define @xmath177 concavity guarantees that @xmath178 whenever @xmath72 is large enough , it is trivial to reduce the grand canonical ensemble to a two state ensemble , and the entropy then boils down to @xmath179 hence , the product , @xmath180 vanishes exponentially fast when @xmath181 the rate of decrease is governed by that scale defined by @xmath182 to be extracted from the tuned data .",
    "then one can estimate an order of magnitude for the difference between the free energy and the energy .",
    "this estimate can be viewed as an error bar for the prediction of exotic nuclei via the present `` concavity method '' .",
    "after our previous illustration with the sn isotopes , we now calculate thermodynamical functions from a sequence of sm isotopes , i.e. @xmath183sm to @xmath184sm .",
    "we want to again observe the behavior of such thermodynamical functions and , furthermore , extrapolate them .",
    "the extrapolation might provide `` predictions '' of the binding energies of lighter isotopes , from @xmath185sm to @xmath186sm for instance , which are quoted by the data tables @xcite-@xcite . according to the same data tables , indeed ,",
    "the available accuracies for such lighter sm nuclei still leave room for a large amount of theory .    our list of raw data , @xmath187 is , from @xmath185sm to @xmath184sm ,    \\{1023616 , 1034967 , 1048320 , 1059004 , 1072104 , 1082088 , 1094512 , 1103976 , 1116005 , 1125291 , 1136834 , 1145788 , 1156935 , 1165489 , 1176615 , 1185216 , 1195736}.    we will not use the first seven nuclei in our calculations of @xmath188 @xmath189 @xmath163 etc . , because of limited and/or poorly known data for those nuclei .",

    "the list of errors , @xmath196 generated by this most simple fit from @xmath183sm to @xmath184sm , is , \\{-109 , 46 , 101 , 58 , 71 , -79 , -178 , -61 , 176 , -24}. the right part of fig .",
    "6 shows that an extrapolation towards lighter nuclei can be considered .",
    "but an extrapolation towards heavier ones seems to be much less valid , with bad lower bounds .",
    "the corresponding energies @xmath197 of excited states @xcite , from @xmath183sm to @xmath184sm , are now used for the calculation of thermodynamical functions , @xmath198 @xmath188 @xmath189 etc .",
    "we take into account the lowest ten states per nucleus , whenever possible , and ambiguous spins are set to their minimum possible values .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "it confirms all the analysis done with the sn isotopes . the left part of fig .",
    "7 shows the fluctuations of @xmath199 for @xmath200 kev , ( upper curve ) , and @xmath143 kev , ( lower curve ) , respectively . except at both ends of the list of data used for the calculation , a fluctuation of at least @xmath201 is observed .",
    "this seems compatible with an extrapolation .",
    "note , however , that difficulties are not excluded , because , indeed , the complete vanishing of the fluctuation at @xmath183sm and @xmath184sm is not a good omen .",
    "such end effects seem to be weaker in the right part of fig . 7 , which shows , again for the same temperatures , the behaviors of the average energy and the free energy .",
    "dashed curves correspond to @xmath200 kev and full curves to @xmath158 kev , respectively .",
    "the curves above the dots represent @xmath202 and those below them represent @xmath166 we , thus , see again `` error bands '' , which shrink when @xmath89 diminishes .",
    "it is tempting to use the pair of curves , @xmath189 @xmath168 at @xmath158 kev to attempt extrapolations , but the temperature is clearly too low ; indeed , the curve for @xmath144 shows the onset of its angular limit at @xmath203 and a close inspection of the curve for @xmath168 at the same temperature , @xmath143 kev , detects `` angular trends '' as well .",
    "hence , we shall use @xmath204 kev for the calculation of @xmath163 and @xmath140 kev for @xmath128 as a compromise to obtain much less angular curves . as an additional precaution",
    ", we shall now use only the eight nuclei from @xmath205sm to @xmath206sm for the calculation of thermodynamical functions ; we remove @xmath183sm because of its lack of known excited states and @xmath184sm because of shell closure effects . the difference , @xmath207",
    "is then plotted in fig .",
    "the width of the band defined by @xmath208 and @xmath209 as functions of @xmath153 can be estimated from fig .",
    "8 to be @xmath210 kev .",
    "smaller values at both ends are obviously misleading , because they represent the edge effects of the truncation of the data base , where the chemical potential is large with both signs .",
    "predictions might , thus , be listed with a @xmath211 kev error . for a somewhat crude analytical continuation below @xmath205sm",
    ", we make a least square fit by a cubic polynomial between @xmath22sm and @xmath212sm .",
    "voluntarily , the fit does not take into account the functions @xmath208 and @xmath209 in the interval between @xmath205sm and @xmath22sm and in that between @xmath212sm and @xmath206sm , because we want to avoid the edge effects observed in fig .",
    "we accept an order @xmath213 for the polynomials rather than the simpler order , @xmath214 because we want to take into account a skewness of the plots of @xmath144 and @xmath166 we verified that , despite such an odd order , such fitted polynomials still induce concavity in a large enough interval .",
    "the polynomial fitting @xmath208 reads , @xmath215 and that fitting @xmath209 reads , @xmath216 the results are shown in fig .",
    "9 , where the full curves represent the thermodynamical functions , as estimated numerically , and the dashed curves represent their polynomial fits , extrapolated .",
    "it is seen that such polynomial approximations for @xmath144 and @xmath168 define a `` crescent '' rather than a band , see fig .",
    "the method , therefore , has obviously a limited validity domain , so long as a better extrapolation scheme is not found . as seen from fig .",
    "9 , `` predictions '' for @xmath183sm and @xmath186sm will be reasonable , but it seems more risky to use this method below @xmath186sm .",
    "it is clear that the difficulty is due to the absence of known excited states for isotopes lighter than @xmath205sm , making it impossible to estimate the thermodynamical functions below @xmath205sm accurately enough .",
    "many prediction schemes can be provided by this method .",
    "for instance , the formula , @xmath217 - 10000 \\times a + 245000 - 1250 \\times mod[a+1,2 ] - 36 \\times ( a-139)^2 , \\label{predmid}\\ ] ] takes the middle between the presumed upper bound , @xmath218 and the presumed lower bound , @xmath219 simultaneously , and necessarily , it inverts eq .",
    "( [ tunesm ] ) .",
    "the results for @xmath123sm , @xmath186sm , @xmath183sm , and @xmath184sm read , respectively , @xmath220 to be compared with the values taken from the mass tables , @xmath221 hence the corresponding errors are , @xmath222 to be compared with those from @xmath22sm to @xmath212sm , @xmath223 and those , @xmath224 for the two nuclei , @xmath205sm and @xmath206sm , that were excluded from our least square fit but contributed to the thermodynamical estimates . as expected from fig .",
    "9 , such results for @xmath186sm and @xmath183sm are quite satisfactory ; they lie very much inside the estimated error bar , @xmath225 kev .",
    "somewhat unexpectedly , a tolerable result is found for @xmath123sm .",
    "but , again as expected , if only from fig",
    ". 9 , a large error is found for @xmath184sm .",
    "another formula , @xmath226 - 36 \\times ( a-139)^2 , \\label{predf}\\ ] ] obviously gives candidate lower bounds . for @xmath123sm , @xmath186sm and @xmath183sm , it generates the following errors , @xmath227 with a serious failure for @xmath123sm .",
    "but , if one does not trust such a formula beyond , say , one unit of mass below @xmath183sm , another formula , @xmath228 - 36 \\times ( a-139)^2 , \\label{predtgf}\\ ] ] uses concavity and the derivative , @xmath229 to predict lower bounds . with",
    "@xmath230 the errors for @xmath123sm , @xmath186sm and @xmath183sm become , @xmath231 as should be , the first and third numbers are smaller than those obtained from eq .",
    "( [ predf ] ) and the second number is unchanged . more important , the first number , with still the wrong sign for an expected lower bound , is now so small that the `` prediction '' is excellent if it is not a fortunate coincidence .",
    "it should be kept in mind that our experimental data are anyhow accurate only within tens of kev .    in turn , the formula , @xmath232 - 36 \\times ( a-139)^2 , \\label{predh}\\ ] ] is assumed to yield upper bounds .",
    "then concavity states that the further formula , @xmath233 - 10000 \\times a + 245000 - 1250 \\times mod[a+1,2 ] - 36 \\times ( a-139)^2 , \\label{sech}\\ ] ] yields higher upper bounds . for @xmath123sm , @xmath186sm and @xmath183sm",
    "again , the respective errors read @xmath234 and @xmath235 the second set shows , as expected , larger errors than the first one .",
    "this section , which uses sm isotope data , has thus completely confirmed the theorems and properties , tested in the previous section with sn isotope data .",
    "a limit to the validity of the method has been found , however : experimental data for @xmath123sm , @xmath186sm and @xmath183sm can be confirmed by this theory , but , because of a very severe lack of excited state data below @xmath205sm , we find it unreasonable to extend the present `` thermodynamical '' theory all the way to @xmath185sm , and even less reasonable to use it for predicting sm isotopes lighter than @xmath185sm .",
    "this does not prevent us , as an extension of the right part of fig .",
    "6 , from attempting a polynomial fit for ground - state energies from , say , @xmath183sm to @xmath185sm and extrapolating for lighter nuclei .",
    "but the only `` thermodynamical '' aspect of such an extrapolation from just ground - state energies would be to retain the same error bar as that obtained from fig .",
    "we first recalled @xcite how a table of ground - state energies for a sequence of isotopes can be converted into a concave pattern .",
    "this involved simple manipulations : for instance an explicit term , accounting for pairing in even nuclei , can be subtracted from the bindings .",
    "similar arguments leading to concavity are obviously possible for isotones as well , and furthermore for any other sequence of neighboring nuclei in any direction across the table of known nuclei .",
    "once this empirical tuning has been implemented , linear or polynomial extra- and interpolations of the concave pattern may provide surprisingly accurate estimates of , or bounds for , binding energies .",
    "the terms which were added to induce concavity are subtracted _ in fine _ , naturally .",
    "this work defined a more ambitious extra- and interpolation scheme , involving thermodynamical functions from a grand canonical ensemble , because such functions may have rigorous concavity properties .",
    "a few theorems are available , indeed .",
    "for instance , the free energy is a concave function of the average particle number .",
    "it is also a decreasing function of the temperature .",
    "we also found `` quasi - theorems '' , more precisely strong numerical evidences , concerning the average energy .",
    "for instance , this average energy seems to be , except for minor accidents , a concave function of the average particle number .    for",
    "every given , finite temperature , we found that the average energy and the free energy , as functions of the average particle number , give upper and lower bounds , respectively , for the concave envelope of the ground - state energies .",
    "when the temperature vanishes , both bounds converge to the exact results .",
    "a difficulty remains for extrapolations at this vanishing temperature , however : the analyticity of such thermodynamical functions is lost , because their limit is only piecewise continuous .",
    "it is , therefore , necessary to retain a minimum temperature if one wants to obtain practical extrapolations for the prediction of exotic nuclei .",
    "this is because a minimum amount of particle number fluctuation is obviously necessary to justify the conversion of particle number , an initially discrete quantity , into a continuous variable .",
    "we , therefore , implemented numerical estimates of several thermodynamical functions at moderate temperatures , a few hundred kev at most .",
    "this yields a first result , namely a `` band '' , enclosing ground - state energies between the average energy and the free energy .",
    "the width of the band defines an error bar which can be definitely trusted when extrapolations are made .",
    "a difficulty arises , however , because of an insufficient number of excited states ; these , obviously , are missing at both ends of any sequence of isotopes .",
    "more than often , only the ground - state energy is known for such neutron rich or neutron poor nuclei .",
    "the calculation of the average and free energies is thus possible only in an interval smaller than the interval of masses where ground states are known .",
    "two tactics are then available , namely i ) an extrapolation of the sequence of ground - state energies alone and ii ) an extrapolation of the thermodynamical functions , starting from a smaller interval .",
    "the first approach was the subject of our previous work @xcite , and the present work makes it more reliable because of the derivation of an error bar in this paper .",
    "the present work tested the second tactic , with some success . but a limitation was found : because of the lack of known excited states , edge effects are present in the calculation of thermodynamical functions and , therefore , it is better to restrict polynomial fits to even a slightly smaller mass interval .",
    "then , extrapolations by means of such polynomials seem to be reliable within only two , at most three mass units towards drip lines .",
    "it is clear that our polynomial extrapolations , while useful , do not take enough into account analytical properties which could be derived from the simplicity of an hamiltonian of the form , @xmath236 and further analytical properties of thermodynamical functions such as @xmath237,$ ] eq .",
    "( [ definz ] ) .",
    "semi - classical approximations , for instance , are likely to improve this method , when extrapolations are implemented .",
    "this is in our agenda .    in any case",
    ", we can make the strong conclusion that the combination of concavity and extrapolations of thermodynamical functions gives a systematic set of upper and lower bounds for the prediction of ground - state energies .",
    ": we thank i. allison for helpful discussions and assistance with the management of the data sets .",
