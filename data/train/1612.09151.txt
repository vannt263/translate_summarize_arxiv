    "over the last two decades , atomic bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) have offered an ideal testbed for the exploration of coherent structures relevant to nonlinear wave systems  @xcite .",
    "most of these entities have not only been theoretically predicted but also in many case examples experimentally verified @xcite .",
    "some of the most notable ones are the bright  @xcite , dark  @xcite and gap  @xcite matter - wave solitons .",
    "higher dimensional analogues of these structures have also been examined , such as vortices  @xcite , solitonic vortices and vortex rings  @xcite .",
    "although the main emphasis of study has been the case of single component systems , in recent years , the study of multi - component variants has also gained a significant traction  @xcite . there",
    ", new fundamental waveforms may arise such as the symbiotic dark - bright ( db ) soliton in self - defocusing media ( where a bright wave would not exist , yet it survives being confined by the dark component )  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the experimental study of such states was initiated considerably earlier in nonlinear optics , per the observation of db solitary wave structures and their molecules  @xcite .",
    "more recently , atomic becs enabled a wide variety of relevant studies initially motivated by the theoretical study of  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the experimental realization of dbs  @xcite was followed by a series of experiments exploring the dynamics and properties of these states including in - trap oscillations of the solitons , their spontaneous generation ( e.g. via counterflow experiments ) and their interactions both with other dbs and with external potential barriers  @xcite .    a natural question that has emerged in connection with solitary waves in atomic becs concerns the fate of these types of excitations in the presence of quantum fluctuations .",
    "this has been considered for bright solitons  @xcite , and dark solitons  @xcite , in trapped settings , as well as in the presence of optical lattices  @xcite .",
    "a number of these works , including  @xcite among others , has also explored the role of quantum fluctuations and higher orbitals in the presence of solitonic interactions .",
    "many of the resulting findings suggest that slower solitons and smaller atom numbers result in significant deviations from the mean - field , gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) limit .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , such studies have not been performed in a systematic fashion in multi - component settings and for associated solitary wave structures . in that light , herein we explore the case of db solitons and their dynamics , as well as collisions both at and beyond the mean - field limit . to incorporate the quantum fluctuations stemming from the correlations in the db soliton dynamics , we employ the multi - layer multi - configuration time - dependent hartree method for bosons ( ml - mctdhb )  @xcite designed for simulating the quantum dynamics of bosonic mixtures .",
    "we consider both the oscillation of a single db solitary wave in a trap , as well as the interaction of two symmetric solitary waves inside a parabolic trap .",
    "we compare and contrast the findings of the mean - field case ( where a single orbital is effectively used in the dark- and bright- components ) with cases where multiple orbitals are used .",
    "the robustness of the presented results is ensured by exploring settings that involve a higher number of orbitals thereby supporting the validity of our approximation and of the observed beyond mean - field excitations ( see also appendix b ) . within the employed multi - orbital approximation bipartite entanglement ( see @xcite and references therein ) between the distinguishable species resulting from the spontaneous fragmentation of the dbs is generally present .",
    "more importantly it is the interplay between fragmentation and the resulting entanglement which gives rise to the observed dynamical structures .",
    "the dynamics of a single db soliton is first analyzed .",
    "it is shown that from the early stages of the dynamics the initial db solitary wave becomes both fragmented and entangled , and consequently splits into two db solitonic fragments signalling its decay .",
    "this is in direct contrast with the pure mean - field description where the db soliton remains intact for large propagation times .",
    "after the splitting process novel structures of multi - orbital nature emerge , such as dark - antidark states  @xcite , with the latter corresponding to density humps on top of the bec background , and domain - walls ( dw )  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding decay time increases for larger initial velocities thus approaching the mean - field limit .",
    "furthermore the lifetime of the db entity decreases for larger particle number imbalance ( i.e. varying the number of atoms in the dark soliton component upon keeping fixed the number of atoms in the respective bright counterpart ) . as a next step the collisional dynamics between two dbs is investigated .",
    "we find that in this case too , both fragmentation and entanglement are evident from the beginning of the dynamics .",
    "perhaps more intriguingly , a variety of unprecedented ( and some unique to the multi - component setting ) states are identified , even if in a transient form during our dynamical evolutions .",
    "these include among others db solitons in _ higher _ orbitals alone , db solitons involving both the lower and higher orbitals , dws , as well as dark - antidark type structures between the orbitals of the same ( dark ) component .",
    "it is important to note that in the cases reported significant fractions of populations arise in higher orbitals even among the 500 or 1000 atoms present in the dark component .",
    "our presentation proceeds as follows .",
    "section ii provides an overview of the setup and background , in which we discuss the preparation of the db solitons and related states .",
    "next , we present and discuss our numerical results for the single db soliton dynamics ( section iii ) and the db soliton collisions ( section iv ) .",
    "finally , in section v , we provide our conclusions .",
    "appendix a focuses on the initial state preparation , while appendix b is dedicated to a discussion of our computational approach and the convergence of our simulations .",
    "dark - bright solitons are non - linear excitations observed in one - dimensional ( 1d ) population - imbalanced binary becs . such excitations are characterized by a density depletion for the majority component ( that we will hereafter dub species @xmath0 ) of the bec , accompanied by a density accumulation for the minority component ( hereafter referred to as species @xmath1 ) . in the mean - field approximation the prototypical 1d model where",

    "the approximate nature of the profile stems from the effective multiplication with the equilibrium background @xmath13 ( at least in the case where @xmath13 is not a constant ) , which in the thomas - fermi limit reads : @xmath24 . here",
    ", @xmath25 refers to the external trapping potential .",
    "in addition to the above approximation , the realm of the mean - field itself leads to the following two assumptions ( irrespectively of configuration ) : ( a ) the two species of the binary bec are uncorrelated and ( b ) the constituting particles of each component are uncorrelated .",

    "the latter allows us to obtain converged results with a reduced number of basis states compared to expansions relying on a time - independent basis .",
    "also , the symmetry of the bosonic species is explicitly employed .",
    "finally , the multi - layer ansatz for the total wave function is based on a coarse - graining cascade , where strongly correlated degrees of freedom are grouped together and treated as subsystems , which mutually couple to each other .",
    "the latter enables us to adapt the ansatz to intra- and inter - species correlations and makes ml - mctdhb a highly flexible tool for simulating the dynamics of e.g. bipartite systems .",
    "the primitive underlying basis for both the newton - krylov algorithm and the ml - mctdhb simulations corresponds to a sine discrete variable representation ( dvr ) with 1200 grid points .",
    "the number of species functions is always kept equal to @xmath275 . to obtain the corresponding order of approximation we use a specific number of species functions @xmath35 and single particle functions @xmath276 ( given within the main text ) . to track the numerical error and guarantee the accurate performance of the numerical integration for the ml - mctdhb equations of motion we impose the following overlap criteria @xmath277 and @xmath278 for the total wavefunction and the spfs respectively .",

    "then , we present the relative error at the core of the dark component ( i.e. minimizing the effect of the background ) between the 10-(2,4 ) and 10-(3,4 ) approximations i.e. by adding one more spf in the dark component .",
    "we remark that the harmonic oscillator potential allows for the separation of the center of mass ( cm ) , @xmath282 , from the relative coordinates @xmath283 .",
    "this separation enables to reduce the @xmath284-body interacting problem to an interacting @xmath285-body problem in the relative coordinates , and a non - interacting one for the cm coordinate .",
    "then the many - body hamiltonian reads @xmath286 where @xmath287 is the single particle harmonic oscillator hamiltonian of the center of mass , and @xmath288 is the interaction hamiltonian in the relative coordinates .",
    "however , our calculations within ml - mctdhb have been performed in the lab frame and as a consequence do not utilize the aforementioned separation of variables .",
    "note that the ml - mctdhb ansatz ( as well as the corresponding mean - field ansatz ) does not trivially respect the separation between the cm and relative frame . to judge about relative deviations of the ml - mctdhb propagation with the full schrdinger equation ( and consequently about convergence ) we compare the ml - mctdhb obtained evolution of the center of mass coordinate to the analytical one",
    ". since we are interested only in the one and two - body densities we are able to calculate the first and second statistical moments of the center of mass .",
    "the second moment of the cm position ( position variance ) reads @xmath289 where @xmath290 denotes the mean position of the @xmath76-th species and @xmath291 refers to the two - body spatial moment of the position of particles of species @xmath76 and @xmath225 respectively .    by using the ehrenfest theorem on the center of mass hamiltonian @xmath292",

    "this latter expression offers the opportunity to directly measure the deviation between the correlated approach , the mean - field ansatz , and the analytical result @xcite . to expose this deviation we numerically calculate the position variance ( using different number of orbitals or species functions ) and compare with eq .",

    "the observed deviation at long propagation times is of the order of @xmath242 lying within the numerical error of the lattice discretization @xmath298 .",
    "note that increasing the number of spfs the correlated approach ( see e.g. the 15-(2,4 ) approximation ) tends to a better agreement with the analytical result .",
    "as expected , the mean - field result ( when compared to the correlated approximation ) possesses a larger deviation with the analytics . also",
    "the case of slow velocities shows a comparatively larger deviation ( than the case of fast velocities ) as it possesses a larger amount of depletion .",
    "note that within the current calculations we do not ensure the convergence of the ml - mctdhb simulations at the level of the ( @xmath299)-body wavefunction , as such investigations are computationally prohibitive for the large particle numbers considered here .",
    "however , we showcase the robustness of the emerging structures in the beyond mean - field dynamics for lower order properties e.g. the one - body density matrix and related one - body quantities . to demonstrate the order of approximation of our results we present the evolution of the relative error integrated within the `` core '' of the dark soliton .",

    "it is observed that in the species mean - field case , i.e. 1-(3,4 ) approximation , the two db structures after the decay produce a jet - like structure and all db entities are lost .",
    "the latter indicates the inescapable necessity of taking more than one species functions for the described excitation dynamics , due to the emergence of the inter - species modes of entanglement .",
    "the convergence of our results for a given number of spfs ( @xmath312 and increasing number of @xmath35 is observed , verifying that the nature of excitations does not change for increasing number of available inter - species modes of entanglement @xmath35 . on the other hand , by inspecting the dynamics within the approximations 10-(2,4 ) and 10-(3,4 ) we observe a similar qualitative behaviour ( confirming also the above described relative error [ see fig .",
