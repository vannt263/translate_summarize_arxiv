    "lepton flavour violation ( lfv ) has become a hot topic over the last few years . on the one hand ,",
    "the discovery of neutrino oscillations in combination with the minimal extension of the standard model ( sm ) predicts lepton flavour violation for the charged leptons , however , at a completely unobservable level . on the other hand , many extensions of the sm predict lfv at much higher rates , which , in some cases , may already be in conflict with existing experimental bounds @xcite ( see also @xcite for a recent summary of @xmath1-factory results ) . with the advent of new experimental facilities @xcite ( see also @xcite ) the current bounds will be pushed further , if not a discovery will be made . in particular , at the lhc experiments it will be possible to detect lfv decays of a @xmath0 lepton , especially into channels with three leptons ; here the signal @xmath2 will be one of the cleanest signatures @xcite .",
    "there are many models which predict lfv @xmath0 decays of the form @xmath3 with @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "all these models will eventually match onto a set of local four - fermion operators or radiative operators , the latter mediating @xmath5 with subsequent decay of the ( virtual ) photon into a charged lepton pair . in",
    "a bottom - up approach , this allows us to consider all possible four - fermion and radiative operators with arbitrary coupling constants , which can be determined by studying the decay distributions of the three leptons in the final state .",
    "even if no signal events are found , such a study of the decay distributions is necessary to determine the efficiency of an experiment and hence to extract reliable limits .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we will introduce the general set of effective operators of dimension six and eight , which mediate the decays @xmath6 at the electroweak scale .",
    "this includes four - fermion operators with scalar , vector and tensor currents as well as radiative operators contributing to @xmath7 .",
    "these operators match onto the relevant low - energy interactions at the scale of the @xmath0 mass , which are parameterized by a number of unknown coupling constants . we will also give a brief discussion on how the couplings are related to the lepton masses and the pmns neutrino mixing matrix within minimal - flavour violating scenarios @xcite .",
    "focusing on the decays @xmath8 in section  [ sec : taumu ] and @xmath9 in section  [ sec : taue ] , we calculate the dalitz distributions for the individual chirality structures appearing in the effective hamiltonian , taking into account interference terms apart from corrections of order @xmath10 .",
    "we conclude with a brief comparison of existing results on lfv processes in specific new physics scenarios in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "in this paper we follow a bottom - up approach to lepton - flavour violating decays , using an effective - field - theory picture .",
    "we assume that some new physics at a high scale @xmath11 induces lepton - flavour violating processes .. ] at the electro - weak scale these lepton - flavour - violating interactions manifest themselves in higher dimensional operators which have to be compatible with the @xmath12 gauge symmetry of the sm .",
    "the leading operators for processes involving charged leptons will be of dim=6 and dim=8 , which we shall construct in the following ( similar analyses within the context of supersymmetric extensions of the sm can be found , for instance , in @xcite ) .    to this end",
    "we group the left - handed leptons in an @xmath13 doublet , while the right - handed charged leptons ( which are singlets under @xmath13 ) are put into an incomplete doublet , as a reminiscent of a right - handed @xmath14 related to custodial symmetry .",
    "writing also the higgs boson in matrix form , we have @xmath15 for simplicity , we have suppressed the family indices , which will be specified once we consider a particular decay mode . for later use",
    ", we note that the hypercharge @xmath16 is defined in terms of the right - handed generator @xmath17 as @xmath18 in terms of the fields defined in ( [ fields ] ) , the list of operators relevant for @xmath19 decays reads    @xmath20    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the @xmath23 gauge field , @xmath24 are the @xmath13 gauge fields , and @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the corresponding gauge couplings . in the above list",
    "we have only shown operators that have tree - level contributions to leptonic @xmath0-decays ; more operators , which are bi - linear in the lepton fields and contribute at the loop level , can be found e.g.  in @xcite .",
    "we also neglected dim=8 operators involving additional covariant derivatives .",
    "when acting on fermions , the derivatives become fermion masses by the equations of motions , such that these operators are additionally suppressed by the small lepton yukawa couplings . notice",
    "that the leptonic dim=6 operators @xmath27 only contain helicity conserving currents .",
    "the most general effective hamiltonian at the electro - weak scale is then obtained by summing over these operators , multiplied by arbitrary coefficients for every flavour combination . in a particular new physics scenario , these coefficient should be obtained by matching at the new physics scale @xmath11 and evolving down to the scale @xmath28 within the sm ( as an effective theory ) .    in the following we are interested in lfv decays of a @xmath0 lepton into three charged leptons .",
    "to this end we have to construct the effective interaction at the scale of the @xmath0 lepton , by integrating out the weak gauge bosons and the higgs .",
    "we will focus on @xmath29 decays ; the decay distributions for @xmath30 decays are identical . on the level of four - fermion operators with dim=6",
    ", we obtain the same structures as in ( [ o1]-[o4 ] ) . projecting on charged leptons",
    "only , we see that @xmath31 becomes equivalent to @xmath32 , and both match onto a purely left - handed operator @xmath33 where here and in what follows the superscript of the coupling denotes the combinations of chiralities involved and the subscript denotes the relevant dirac structure .",
    "likewise , the operator @xmath34 corresponds to a purely right - handed interaction @xmath35 while we get a mixed term from the operator @xmath36 @xmath37 notice that the chirality structure @xmath38 is not independent , since it can be fierz rearranged into @xmath39 .",
    "the dim=6 radiative operators contain charged as well as neutral currents .",
    "here we are only interested in the neutral - current component , coupling to a charged lepton pair .",
    "switching to the physical photon and @xmath40 fields and integrating out the higgs and the @xmath40 , we find that we obtain a radiative operator with a photon , as well as a four - fermion contribution from @xmath40 exchange .",
    "the latter is proportional to @xmath41 where @xmath42 are the ( axial)vector couplings of the @xmath40 to the leptons .",
    "taking into account the fact that @xmath43 is of the order of the @xmath0 mass , we find that this operator is suppressed relative to the leading ones by the small yukawa coupling of the @xmath0 lepton .",
    "thus , only the photonic contribution has to be taken into account . for this",
    "we obtain at the scale @xmath44 @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 denote the two possible chirality combinations .",
    "vertex could be parametrized as @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 , see , for instance , @xcite . ]",
    "the matrix element for @xmath51 becomes @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the momentum transfer through the photon .",
    "this momentum transfer is proportional to the lepton masses , and thus this contribution scales as @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a yukawa coupling of the leptons , which would lead to an enhancement unless an additional yukawa coupling appears in the numerator as e.g. in minimal flavour violation ( see below ) .",
    "finally , we turn to the four - fermion operators with the chirality structure @xmath56 or @xmath57 . at tree - level",
    ", they receive contributions from the dim=8 operators @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , only .",
    "therefore , their matching coefficients are further suppressed by @xmath61 .",
    "the one - loop matching coefficients at the electroweak scale may also receive contributions from the dim=6 operators @xmath62 , @xmath63 , but in this case the required chirality flips induce an additional suppression by @xmath64 . ignoring contributions suppressed by @xmath61 or @xmath64 , this reduces the number of possible dirac structures already to six in the case where the radiative operator can contribute and to four in cases like @xmath65 , where the radiative contribution is absent .",
    "the corresponding couplings @xmath66 are matrices in lepton flavour space .",
    "there are in total six different decay modes of the @xmath29 to consider ,    @xmath67    @xmath68    notice that ( [ decay1 ] - [ decay4 ] ) contain two identical particles ( @xmath69 or @xmath70 ) in the final state , whereas ( [ decay5 ] + [ decay6 ] ) do not .",
    "moreover , only ( [ decay1 ] , [ decay2 ] , [ decay5 ] , [ decay6 ] ) receive contributions from the radiative operators ( [ rad ] ) via @xmath71      the flavour structure of the coupling constant has been investigated within the framework of minimal flavour violation in the lepton sector ( mlfv @xcite ) . in a scenario with the minimal field content ( [ fields ] ) ,",
    "the breaking of the lepton flavour symmetry @xmath72 is described by two spurion fields @xmath73 where @xmath74 describes the sm yukawa couplings of the charged leptons , and the matrix @xmath75 stems from a dim-5 lepton - number violating term , @xmath76 where @xmath77 has vanishing quantum numbers under the complete sm gauge group .",
    "if the scale @xmath78 , associated with lepton - number violation , is sufficiently large , the resulting neutrino masses @xmath79 are small , even if the spurion @xmath80 has generic entries of order unity .",
    "we are interested in 4-lepton processes , induced by operators with some flavour structure @xmath81 to render these operators formally invariant under the flavour group , they have to be multiplied by appropriate factors of @xmath82 and @xmath80 . in the following",
    "we will consider the minimal number of spurion insertions , only .",
    "are smaller than their average @xmath83 .",
    "notice that , unlike in the case of the quark ckm matrix , the off - diagonal entries of the pmns matrix are not always small . ]    starting with the case of @xmath84 , we need at least two spurion insertions . the possible flavour structures can be read off the reduction of the @xmath85 tensor product for @xmath80 and @xmath86 , @xmath87 here the flavour singlet term corresponds to the trace of @xmath88 , @xmath89 = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\rm ln}^2}{v^4 }         \\left ( m_{\\nu_1}^2+m_{\\nu_3}^2+m_{\\nu_3}^2\\right )   \\equiv 3 \\ , \\frac{\\lambda_{\\rm ln}^2 \\",

    "in particular , one finds that @xmath92 whereas @xmath93 and @xmath94 are further suppressed by the neutrino mixing angle @xmath95 .",
    "it is to be stressed that @xmath96 does neither depend on the absolute neutrino mass scale @xmath97 , nor on potential majorana phases @xmath98 in the pmns matrix .",
    "the flavour structure of the corresponding invariant 4-lepton operator reads @xmath99 the coefficients of specific flavour transitions are thus given by the quadratic neutrino mass differences and pmns elements . by the same argument , the operator @xmath100 is invariant under the flavour group .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that @xmath96 also drives all possible flavour transitions induced by operators that are bilinear in the lepton fields .",

    "if the radiative operators do not dominate the @xmath110 decay amplitudes , the purely leptonic decay modes are not directly correlated with the radiative ones @xmath111 .",

    "to obtain the dominating flavour coefficients for the operators in ( [ llll ] , [ llrr ] , [ rad ] ) , relevant for flavour - violating @xmath0 decays in mlfv , one has to consider @xmath122 g_v^{(l_k l^i)(r_l r^j ) }   & \\to & c_3 \\ , \\delta_i^k \\,\\delta_{j}^{l } \\ , , \\\\[0.1em ]",
