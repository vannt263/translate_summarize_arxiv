    "spin squeezing has attracted much attention for decades  kitagawa1993,wineland1994,sorensen2001,toth2007,toth2009,sorensenmolmer , wangsanders , ma2011 .",
    "an important application of spin squeezing is to detect quantum entanglement  @xcite . as a multipartite entanglement witness ,",
    "spin squeezing is relatively easy to be generated and measured  @xcite .",
    "many efforts have been devoted to find relations between spin squeezing and entanglement  @xcite .",
    "another application of spin squeezing is to improve the precision of measurements .",
    "for example , spin squeezing plays an important role in making more precise atomic clock  @xcite and gravitational - wave interferometers  @xcite , and so on .",
    "spin - squeezed states are useful resources for quantum information processing . however , in practice , decoherence is inevitable and harmful to spin squeezing and entanglement  @xcite",
    ". generally , when the system - bath coupling strength is weak enough , the decoherence is studied by using the master equation method , which is derived by employing the born approximation  @xcite . besides",
    ", the markov approximation can be applied if the time scale of the bath is much shorter than that of the system . to overcome the above approximations , a set of hierarchical equations were established by tanimura _ et al _",
    "tanimura1989,tanimura1990 , tanimura1991,tanimura2005,tanimura2006_1,tanimura2007,tanimura2006_2 .",
    "it provides an exact way to obtain the reduced dynamics of system  tanimura2010,ma2012 .",
    "however , for numerical reasons , it is hard to treat systems with large number of particles straightforwardly . here",
    ", we show that for the open system we consider , we can reduce the multi - particle dynamics to the two - particle one , and then we efficiently use the hierarchy equation method to make numerical calculations .    as we know , spin squeezing is a multipartite entanglement witness .",
    "reference  @xcite has shown that for a many - particle system with exchange symmetry , the spin squeezing parameters of the total system can be expressed in terms of local expectations and correlations . here , we consider such an ensemble of @xmath0 independent spin-@xmath1 particles .",
    "each particle interacts with its own bath , and the baths are independent and identical .",
    "thus , the exchange symmetry is not affected by the decoherence , and the spin squeezing parameters of the open system can be expressed by dynamics of the local expectations and correlations . for the system under consideration , we find that the dynamics of any two particles is governed only by the local hamiltonian of the two particles and their baths .",
    "then , we use the hierarchy equation method to calculate the dynamics the the local expectations and correlations .",
    "reference  @xcite has also shown that the spin squeezing has close relation with pairwise entanglement if the state of the collective spin system lies in the @xmath2 sector , where @xmath3 is the collective angular momentum of the system . therefore , since the state of the system will not lie in @xmath2 sector anymore under decoherence , the ability of spin squeezing in detecting pairwise entanglement needs to be further studied and clarified .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the hamiltonian and the initial state of the open system . the definition of the spin squeezing parameters is given in sec .",
    "iii , and we also discuss the symmetry of the system and reduce the multi - qubit dynamics into the two - qubit one . in sec .",
    "iv , we introduce the hierarchy method and give a alternative form of the hierarchy equation .",
    "we numerically calculate spin squeezing parameters and the rescaled concurrence of the open system under decoherence and compare their behaviors in sec .  iv . at last",
    ", a summary is given in sec .",
    "the system we consider is an ensemble of @xmath0 independent spin-@xmath1 particles with exchange symmetry , and each particle interacts with its own bosonic bath .",
    "the @xmath0 baths are independent and identical .",
    "the hamiltonian of the total system is ( @xmath4 = 1 ) @xmath5 where the first term is the hamiltonian of the system with @xmath6 the pauli matrices for the @xmath7-th spin and @xmath8 the frequency for all qubits .",
    "the second term describes the bosonic bath , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the creation and annihilation operators of the @xmath7-th mode with frequency @xmath11 .",
    "the system - bath coupling is characterized by the third term with @xmath12 the coupling strength for qubit @xmath13 . here , we study @xmath0 independent baths , i.e. , the bath can be divided into @xmath0 parts and @xmath12 is only non - zero when mode @xmath7 belongs to the @xmath14-th part .",
    "the initial state of the total system is set to be a product state @xmath15where @xmath16 is a spin - squeezed state and @xmath17 is a thermal state given by @xmath18with the inverse temperature @xmath19 and partition function @xmath20 for mode @xmath7 . in this paper",
    "we take @xmath21 .",
    "we choose the initial state as a standard one - axis twisted state  kitagawa1993 @xmath22 with @xmath23the total angular momentum operators .",
    "this state is prepared by the one - axis twisted hamiltonian @xmath24 , with the coupling constant @xmath25 , and @xmath26 the twist angle . for our case",
    ", the system of @xmath0 spin-@xmath1 behaves like an effective large spin @xmath27 .",
    "in this section , we give the definitions of two spin squeezing parameters . by discussing the symmetry of the open system under consideration , we know that the spin squeezing can be expressed by the local expectations and correlations .",
    "since we can reduce hte multi - qubit dynamics into a two - qubit one , the spin squeezing can then calculated by the dynamics of the local expectations and correlations .",
    "there are various measures of spin squeezing related to various inequality criteria  @xcite , and we consider two of them as follows : @xmath28here , the minimization in the first equation is over all the directions denoted by @xmath29 , which are perpendicular to the mean spin direction @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath31 in the second equation is the minimal eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath32where @xmath33is the covariance matrix and @xmath34is the global correlation matrix .",
    "the parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 were defined by kitagawa and ueda  @xcite , and tth et al .",
    "@xcite , respectively . if @xmath37 , spin squeezing occurs , and we can safely say that the multipartite state is entangled  toth2009,ma2011 .    from the definitions , we know that the spin squeezing parameters are based on the expectations and correlations of the collective operators . for the limitation of the hierarchy equation method , it is hard to calculate the decoherence of the many - particle system straightforwardly .",
    "since the baths are independent and identical , the exchange symmetry is not affected by decoherence .",
    "therefore , the global expectations or correlations of collective operators can be written as  @xcite @xmath38_{+}\\rangle & = & \\frac{n(n-1)}{4}% \\langle \\lbrack \\sigma _ { 1\\alpha } , \\sigma _ { 2\\beta } ] _ { + } \\rangle,~(\\alpha \\neq \\beta ) ,   \\label{glob_to_loca}\\end{aligned}\\]]which only depend on the expectation values of the local pauli operators , e.g. , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the initial one - axis twisted state we use here has a parity symmetry leading to @xmath41 namely the mean - spin direction is along the @xmath42-axis .",
    "moreover , the mean - spin direction do not change during decoherence .",
    "the proof is given as follows .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) displays only one symmetry , i.e. , the parity symmetry .",
    "the parity operator is given by @xmath43where @xmath44 describes the numbers of excitations of up spins .",
    "obviously , we have @xmath45namely , the hamiltonian and the initial state have a fixed parity .",
    "since the exchange symmetry leads to @xmath46 , we obtain @xmath47   \\notag \\\\ & = & \\mbox{tr}\\big\\{\\sigma _ { 1x}\\pi \\big [ \\pi u(t)\\pi \\big ] \\big [ \\pi \\rho _ { t}(0)\\pi \\big ] \\big [ \\pi u^{\\dagger } ( t)\\pi \\big ] \\pi \\big\\ }   \\notag \\\\ & = & \\mbox{tr}\\big[\\sigma _ { 1x}\\pi u(t)\\rho _ { t}(0)u^{\\dagger } ( t)\\pi \\big ]   \\notag \\\\ & = & \\mbox{tr}\\big[\\pi \\sigma _ { 1x}\\pi u(t)\\rho _ { t}(0)u^{\\dagger } ( t)\\big ]   \\notag \\\\ & = & -\\langle \\sigma _ { 1x}\\rangle , \\end{aligned}\\]]which leads to @xmath48 .",
    "similarly , @xmath49 can be proved .",
    "therefore , during the evolution the mean spin direction is always along the @xmath50-axis . in this case",
    ", the spin squeezing parameters reduce to  wangsanders , wang2010 @xmath51 where @xmath52    for convenience , hereafter we use @xmath53to characterize spin squeezing . with the above definition ,",
    "spin squeezing occurs when @xmath54 .",
    "now we only need to calculate the dynamics of the local expectations and correlations of the spins , the spin squeezing parameters are greatly simplified .",
    "however , we still have to use the dynamics of the density matrix of the system to calculate the local expectations and correlations .",
    "now we prove that we can reduce the multi - qubit dynamics into a two - qubit one .",
    "generally , we consider a system written as follows @xmath55@xmath56 is the hamiltonian of one particle , @xmath57 is the bath hamiltonian , and the couplings are expressed by @xmath58 .",
    "obviously , each of the particles interacts with its own bath .",
    "the particles do not have interaction with each other , and the baths are independent .",
    "equation  ( [ hamiltonian ] ) belongs to this case",
    ".    the time - evolution operator of the total system can be written as @xmath59where @xmath60 .",

    "are the reduced density matrices of the initial state for the system and baths respectively .",
    "the above equation ( [ rho_12 ] ) tells that the evolution of any two particles is governed only by the local hamiltonian of the two particles and their baths .",
    "it is noted that we can reach this conclusion even when the initial state of the system or the baths are entangled states .",
    "therefore , the multi - qubit dynamics reduces to the two - qubit one .",
    "then we use the hierarchy equation method to calculate the two - qubit reduced density matrix of the system , and the dynamics of the local expectations and correlations in eqs .",
    "( [ xi1])-([zita ] ) can also be obtained .    here",
    "we emphasize that we obtain this conclusion without using exchange symmetry , which means that the particles are not necessarily identical , and so do the baths .",
