    "a basic stylized fact of trade execution is that when a trader buys or sells a large amount of stock in a restricted amount of time , the market naturally tends to move in the opposite direction .",
    "if one assumes an unaffected price dynamics for the traded asset , trading activity will impact this price and lead to an affected price .",
    "supply and demand based analysis says that if a trader begins to buy large amounts , other traders will notice and the affected price will tend to increase . similarly ,",
    "if one begins to sell large amounts , the affected price will tend to decrease .",
    "this is particularly important when the market is highly illiquid , since in that case no trade goes unnoticed .",
    "the goal of optimal execution , or more properly optimal scheduling , is to find how to execute the order in a way such that the expected profit or cost is the best possible , taking into account the impact of the trade on the affected price .",
    "as far as we are concerned in this paper , there are two main categories of trading strategies : deterministic , also called static in the execution literature jargon , and adapted , or adaptive .",
    "we will use static / deterministic and adapted / adaptive interchangeably .",
    "deterministic strategies are set before the execution , so that they are independent of the actual path taken by the price .",
    "they only rely on information known initially .",
    "adapted strategies are not known before the execution .",
    "the amount executed at each time depends on all information known up to this time .",
    "clearly market operators , in reality , will monitor market prices and trade based on their evolution , so that the adapted strategy is the more natural one .",
    "however , in some models it is much harder to find an optimal trading strategy in the class of adapted strategies than in the class of static ones . + in 1998",
    ", bertsimas and lo @xcite have defined the best execution as the strategy that minimizes the expected cost of trading over a fixed period of time .",
    "they derive the optimal strategy by using dynamic programming , which means that they go backwards in time .",
    "the optimal solution is therefore sought in the class of adapted strategies , as is natural from backward induction , but is found to be deterministic anyway . however , once an information process is added , influencing the affected price , the optimal solutions are adapted and no longer static .",
    "this approach minimizes the expected trade cost only , without including any risk in the criterion to be optimized .",
    "in particular , the criterion does not take into account the variance of the cost function .",
    "two years later , almgren and chriss @xcite consider the minimization of an objective function that is the sum of the expected execution cost and of a cost - variance risk criterion . unlike the previous model , this setting includes in the criterion the possibility to penalize large variability in the trading cost . to solve the resulting mean - variance optimization ,",
    "almgren and chriss assume the solution to be deterministic from the start .",
    "this allows them to obtain a closed - form solution .",
    "this solution , however , is only the best solution in the class of static strategies , and not in the broader and more natural class of adapted ones .",
    "gatheral and shied @xcite later solve a similar problem , the main difference being that they assume a more realistic model for the unaffected price .",
    "gatheral and schied derive an adapted solution by using an alternative risk criterion , the time - averaged value - at - risk function .",
    "they obtain closed - form expressions for the strategy and the optimal cost .",
    "the solution is not static .",
    "however , this does not seem to lead to a solution that is very different , qualitatively , from the static one .",
    "indeed , brigo and di graziano ( 2014 ) , adding a displaced diffusion dynamics , find that in many situations only the rough statistics of the signal matter in the class of simple regular diffusion models @xcite .",
    "in this paper we will compare the static and fully adapted solutions in detail .    since the solutions obtained in the setting of almgren and chriss @xcite are deterministic , they may be sub - optimal in the set of fully adapted solutions under a cost - variance risk criterion , so several papers have attempted to find adapted solutions by changing the framework slightly .",
    "this allows one to take the new price information into account during the execution , and to have more precise models .",
    "for example , in 2012 almgren @xcite assumes that the volatility and liquidity are random .",
    "he numerically obtains adapted results under these assumptions .",
    "almgren and lorenz @xcite obtain adapted solutions by using an appropriate dynamic programming technique .",
    "+ similarly , in this paper we will focus on what one gains from adopting a more general adapted strategy over a simple deterministic strategy in the classic discrete time setting of bertsimas and lo @xcite with information flow and in the continous time setting of gatheral and schied with time - averaged value - at - risk criterion @xcite .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec : discrete ] we will introduce the discrete time model by bertsimas and lo , looking at the cases of temporary and permanent market impact on the unaffected price , and including the solution for the case where the price is also affected by an information flow process .",
    "we will derive and study the optimal static and fully adapted solutions and compare them , quantifying in a few numerical examples how much one gains from going fully adapted .",
    "in section [ sec : cont ] we will introduce the continuous time model as in gatheral and schied , allowing for both temporary and permanent impact and for a risk criterion based on value at risk .",
    "we will report the optimal fully adapted solution as derived in @xcite and we will derive the optimal static solution using a calculus of variation technique , similar for example to the calculations in @xcite .",
    "we will compare the two solutions and optimal criteria in a few numerical examples , to see again how much one gains from going fully adapted .",
    "section [ sec : conc ] concludes the paper , summarizing its findings , and points to possible future research directions .",
    "let @xmath0 be the number of units left to execute at time @xmath1 , such that @xmath2 is the initial amount and @xmath3 at the final time @xmath4 .",
    "in this section we consider a buy order , so that the purpose of the strategy is to buy an amount @xmath5 of asset by time @xmath4 , minimizing the expected cost of the trade .",
    "the amount to be executed during the time interval @xmath6 is @xmath7 .",
    "we expect @xmath8 to be non - negative , since we would like to implement a pure buy program",

    "@xmath12 represents the relevance of that information , that is how much it impacts the price .",
    "there are two dynamics that we will consider for the real price @xmath22 , depending on whether the market impact is assumed to be permanent or temporary .",
    "we will explain what those terms mean when defining the price dynamics below .",
    "we assume that the market impact is linear in both settings , which means that the market reacts proportionally to the amount executed .    in the case of permanent market impact the mid - price dynamics",
    "are changed by each execution .",
    "this means that when we compute the trade cost , the unaffected price @xmath10 is replaced , during the execution , by the impacted or affected price @xmath22 : @xmath23 where the permanent impact parameter @xmath24 is a positive constant .    in the case of temporary market impact",
    "each execution only changes the price for the current time period .",
    "the mid - price @xmath10 is still given by , and the effective price @xmath22 is derived from @xmath10 each period .",
    "@xmath22 has the following dynamics : + @xmath25 where the temporary impact parameter @xmath26 is a positive constant .    since one case assumes that the impact lasts for the whole trade , and the other assumes that the impact is instantaneous and affects only an order at the time it is done , both are",
    "limit cases of a more general impact pattern that is more progressive , see for example obizhaeva and wang @xcite .",
    "we will keep the two more stylized impact cases and analyze them separately .",
    "the problem in both cases is to minimize the expected cost of execution . since we are considering a buy order",

    "as we mentioned earlier , we do not enforce any constraint on the sign of @xmath9 , which means that we are allowed to sell in our buy order .",
    "we now present some calculations deriving the optimal solution of problem in the cases of permanent and temporary impact .",
    "our calculations in the general setting follow essentially bertsimas and lo @xcite but with a slightly different notation , as done initially in bonart , brigo and di graziano @xcite and kulak @xcite .",
    "we further derive the optimal solution in the static class , using a more straightforward method .      in this section , we solve problem reproducing the solution of bertsimas and lo @xcite , assuming that the market impact is permanent , which means that the affected price follows . in the adapted setting , the problem is solved recursively . at any time @xmath1 , we consider the problem as if @xmath1 was the initial time , and the execution was optimal from time @xmath31 .",
