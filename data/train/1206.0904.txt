    "this includes for instance a strong temperature dependence of the spectrum in the normal state , which was studied in iron pnictides by inosov _",
    "@xcite , as well as the presence of a spin resonance feature below a gapped continuum in the superconducting state , @xcite which also appears in cuprates and in some heavy fermion superconductors .",
    "angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) experiments on iron pnictides@xcite reveal a sharp fermi surface consisting of multiple electron and hole pockets ( see e.g. ref . and references herein ) .",
    "these exhibit comparable superconducting order parameter amplitudes at fermi surface sheets which are nearly nested by the antiferromagnetic wave vector , @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite it thus seems likely that magnetic and electronic order are closely related .",
    "@xcite in the case of antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations as the origin for pairing , the order parameter must have different sign at the electron and hole pockets .",
    "@xcite in this context , we recently endeavored to answer the question of how strongly electrons couple to spin fluctuations in these compounds .",
    "@xcite to this end , we investigated low energy dispersion anomalies , whose position and shape can be traced back to a coupling of bosonic modes - a method which has been proven to be a powerful tool previously in the case of cuprate superconductors .",
    "@xcite in iron - based superconductors such anomalies have been observed in the hole - doped 122 compound ba@xmath1k@xmath2fe@xmath3as@xmath3 by wray _",

    "@xcite guided by similar studies in cuprate superconductors , we look for corresponding signatures in the available arpes data.@xcite there , it was observed that ( i ) the superconducting excitation gap at the fermi surface pockets nested by @xmath0 has the absolute value @xmath8mev , ( ii ) the self - energy effect occurs at an energy @xmath9 , and ( iii ) @xmath10 follows an order - parameter - like evolution in temperature as the resonance energy does .",
    "thus , it is intuitively plausible to conjecture that the magnetic resonance is responsible for the observed self - energy effects . by numerical calculation",
    "we show that this conjecture is theoretically well founded .",
    "motivated by the experimental procedures @xcite to quantify self - energy effects in angle - resolved photoemission experiments , we concentrated in a previous letter on the so - called _ effective self - energy _ as extracted directly from the electronic spectral function.@xcite such an approach allowed us to make an immediate comparison with arpes experiments . in the present work we are taking a more detailed look into our model , introducing the formalism used for our calculations , discussing the renormalization effects entering the electronic structure as well as the fermi surface , and applying our model to photoemission and tunneling experiments .",
    "the appearance of a low - energy resonance mode in the dynamic magnetic susceptibility upon entering the superconducting state is a feature well known from unconventional superconductors ( for a review concerning cuprates see ref .  ) .",
    "as it results from scattering between fermi surface sheets with opposite order - parameter sign its detailed experimental and theoretical investigation is a powerful tool to study the symmetry of the superconducting gap .",
    "@xcite various microscopic theoretical treatments are able to reproduce the resonance feature , such as , for example , in methods employing the random phase approximation ( rpa ) or in the fluctuation exchange ( flex ) approximation .",

    "as our results do not depend on the specific microscopic model for the resonance excitation , we prefer here a semiphenomenological approach .",
    "most of the magnetic correlations are included automatically within the semiphenomenological approach used here by relying on experimental results .    in the following sections we introduce an effective model for the spin susceptibility and establish the connection to recent neutron scattering experiments .      in this section",
    "we summarize the semiphenomenological approach we employ in this paper , which has already been successfully used to describe optimally doped and overdoped cuprate superconductors .",
    "@xcite to motivate its application to iron - based superconductors we recall one possible interpretation of the resonance mode in the spin susceptibility .",
    "we underline , however , that this interpretation is not necessary for our predictions to hold , as we base the spin excitation spectrum on the experimental observations .",
    "let us divide the phase space of electronic excitations into high - energy and low - energy regions , the latter being located around the fermi surfaces and populated by the electronic quasiparticles ( see e.g. ref .  ) .",
