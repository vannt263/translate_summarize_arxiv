    "the study of small deviations of continuous gaussian processes and more general continuous processes is a very active domain of research .",
    "this is also a very specialized area , rich of many specific results , mainly concerning typical processes having strongly regular covariance structure , such as brownian motion , brownian sheet , fractional brownian motions , integrated fractional brownian motions , hurst processes ,  this aspect of the theory has naturally many applications in statistics .",
    "it is also sometimes related to operator theory .",
    "the small deviations problem for the class of stationary gaussian processes is of particular interest , the way how stationary and mixing properties interact being notably not quite well understood .",
    "this is the main focus of this work .",
    "let @xmath17 be throughout a sample continuous stationary gaussian process with covariance function @xmath18 .",
    "the underlying problem is the study for small @xmath19 and @xmath20 large , @xmath21 , @xmath22 say , of the probability @xmath23 one can also separately consider asymptotics for @xmath24 , @xmath25 being fixed , or @xmath26 , @xmath20 fixed .",
    "the most celebrated example of stationary gaussian process is naturally the ornstein - uhlenbeck process @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 denoting the standard brownian motion . and we know that for @xmath30 , there exist positive constants @xmath31 such that for all @xmath32 @xmath33 further @xmath34 as @xmath35 .",
    "see @xcite , lemma 2.2 .",
    "this precise estimate follows from earlier work of newell in which this question is showed to be intimately linked to the sturm - liouville equation @xmath36 let @xmath37 and @xmath38 respectively denote the eigenvalues and normed eigenfunctions of eq.([sl / e ] ) . here",
    "@xmath39 depend on @xmath40 and it is known that @xmath41 form an orthonormal sequence with respect to the weight function @xmath42 . and @xmath43 in ( [ est / ou / cs ] ) .",
    "according to @xcite , @xmath44 for many purposes , the weaker estimate below suffices , and is moreover simpler to establish : for @xmath45 , @xmath46 @xmath47",
    "@xmath48 being absolute constants . the lower bound part follows from talagrand s general lower bound in @xcite . see @xcite,@xcite for recent improvments . as to the upper bound part",
    ", it can be for instance deduced from stolz s estimate @xcite ( corollary 1.2 ) or ( [ uhlenb ] ) .",
    "the small deviations problem of @xmath49 naturally relies on both the behavior of @xmath50 near 0 and near infinity . at this regard ,",
    "it is worth observing that the ( exponential ) rate of decay of @xmath50 near infinity is hidden in ( [ est / ou / cs ] ) and ( [ weaker / ou ] ) .",
    "let us begin with the discrete case .",
    "let @xmath51 be a stationary gaussian sequence . if the sequence @xmath52 is i.i.d .",
    ", then obviously @xmath53    it is rather unexpected that this holds for a very large class of stationary gaussian sequences .",
    "it suffices in effect , that the geometric mean of the radon - nycodim derivative of the absolutely continuous part of its spectrum be finite ; see theorem [ szego ] where a more precise result is established . beyond this case",
    ", that question seems to loose much interest .",
    "for instance if @xmath52 has absolutely continuous spectrum with spectral density @xmath6 , and @xmath6 has infinite geometric mean , then @xmath52 is deterministic .",
    "this yields extremely strong dependence between the successive variables @xmath54 .",
    "the condition that @xmath55 is also sufficient for the validity of ( [ iid ] ) .",
    "we will study these questions through essentially two different ways : one is probabilistic , although based on a real analysis device , and the other of spectral nature .",
    "we shall also compare them on representative classes of examples .",
    "the first is the correlation approach , which is based on powerful correlation inequalities derived from brascamp ",
    "lieb s inequality .",
    "this is investigated in sections [ sdec],[section[corsup]],[section[cgplh ] ] .",
    "we notably establish for the continuous parameter case a rather general upper bound integrating the rate of decay of @xmath50 near infinity .",
    "a first relevant and little known correlation estimate is gebelein s inequality ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath56 be the centered normalized gauss measure on @xmath57 .",
    "let @xmath58 be a gaussian pair with @xmath59 and let @xmath60 .",
    "then for any @xmath61 @xmath62 an analog result is nelson s hyper - contractive estimate , which can be reformulated as follows @xmath63 where @xmath64 .",
    "one can take in particular @xmath65 .",
    "we have given guerra , rosen and simon formulation of nelson s estimate @xcite , which was originally stated for the ornstein - uhlenbeck process .",
    "they also established for this process that @xmath66 for all integers @xmath2 , where @xmath11 and @xmath67 .",
    "a more general form was later proved in a deep work @xcite by klein , landau and shucker .",
    "see lemma [ decoupling ] .",
    "as already mentionned , the main ingredient is a real analysis inequality due to brascamp ",
    "lieb @xcite , which asserts that for any complex - valued functions @xmath68 and real numbers @xmath69 , @xmath70 with @xmath71 , @xmath2 integer , if @xmath72 , then for any vectors @xmath73 in @xmath74 , @xmath70 , @xmath75 and the constant @xmath76 is computable explicitely ( see @xcite , theorems 1,5 ) .",
    "inequalities of this sort were intensively investigated in the recent years , see @xcite for instance and references therein .",
    "the second approach is based on the theory of finite toeplitz forms , especially strong szeg limit theorem and is investigated in section [ toep.szeg ] .",
    "we obtain comparable upper and lower estimates under simple conditions regarding the spectral density of the stationary gaussian sequence .",
    "it seems by the way rather evident to assert that any reasonable attempt for developing a small deviation theory of stationary gaussian processes can not be undertaken without including a large account from the asymptotic theory of eigenvalues of finite toeplitz forms .",
    "this can be well illustrated as follows .",
    "let @xmath52 having a spectral density function @xmath77 and put @xmath78 let @xmath79 denote the covariance matrix of @xmath80 , obviously @xmath81",
    ". the study of the asymptotic distribution of its eigenvalues , as @xmath2 tends to infinity , can be equivalently viewed as the one of the finite toeplitz forms @xmath82 this is an old question .",

    "as @xmath89 , it follows that @xmath90 .",
    "it is well - known that the sets @xmath91 are equally distributed in the weyl sense . according to szeg s limit theorem ( @xcite , chapter 5 ) , for any continuous function @xmath1 defined on",

    "this has immediate consequences concerning the small values of @xmath98 , @xmath99 .",
    "finally we examine in section [ section[ddp ] ] the non - stationary case and use the convenient notion of matrices with dominant principal diagonal .",
    "this direction was explored by li and shao ( see @xcite , see also the survey @xcite and the references therein , as well the earlier work of marcus @xcite ) , and some improvments of their results are established .",
    "we also clarify the relevance of this notion in the context of eigenvalues of hermitian matrices by linking it with gergorin s theorem .",
    "we believe that the used approaches are potentially more developable and should certainly allow to improve on the general knewledge of small deviations in the stationary case .",
