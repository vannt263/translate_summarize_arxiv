    "the effects of interactions between fermions in one - dimension are mainly understood at low energies within the scope of the tomonaga - luttinger model.@xcite this framework is based on the linear approximation to the single - particle spectrum around the fermi energy and provides , via the bosonisation technique,@xcite a generic way to calculate various correlation functions .",
    "understanding of interacting fermions beyond the low - energy limit still presents a challenge .",
    "studies are currently focused on dynamical response functions , @xcite _ e.g. _ the spectral function which can be measured by momentum resolved tunnelling of electrons in semiconductors , @xcite by angle resolved photo - emission in correlated materials , @xcite and by photoemission spectroscopy in cold atoms.@xcite recently significant theoretical progress was achieved in this direction by making a connection between luttinger liquids and the fermi edge singularity problem.@xcite as a result power - law singularities were found at the edge of the spectral function at zero temperature and their powers were related to the corresponding curvature .",
    "@xcite the edge marks the smallest energy at a fixed momentum with which a particle can tunnel into the system . at low energies",
    "the edge disperses linearly with a slope which is the sound velocity of collective modes @xmath1 defined by parameters from the tomonaga - luttinger model ; @xcite a small quadratic correction to the linear slope at low momenta was found in ref . .",
    "in this paper we calculate the position of the edge for the spinless fermions with a short range interaction at arbitrary energies and show that a luttinger parameter is still relevant at large energies .",
    "our strategy is to consider the exact diagonalisation of the model on a lattice via the bethe - ansatz approach .",
    "then we analyse the spectral function in the continuum regime  a combination of the thermodynamic limit and a small occupancy of the lattice@xcite  which corresponds to the continuum model with a contact interaction . in this regime",
    "we find that the position of the edge is parabolic for arbitrary momenta and the prefactor is a function of the dimensionless luttinger parameter @xmath0 [ see eq . ( [ eq : eedge ] ) ] which is defined in the low energy domain of the tomonaga - luttinger model .",
    "our result could be directly observed in experiments on spin - polarised particles such as electrons in ferromagnetic semiconductors @xcite using the setups of refs . or polarised cold atoms using the setup of ref . .",
    "in closely related models of spin chains@xcite the position of the edge depends on the luttinger @xmath0 in an analogous way but , for example for a weakly polarised chain , the parabolic function of momentum becomes a cosine . with the parabolic shape found in this paper , the phenomenological non - linear luttinger liquid theory@xcite gives a divergent power of the edge singularity .    in the continuum regime the luttinger parameter , @xmath0 , is bounded and the smallest @xmath0 for large interaction strengths is almost degenerate with its non - interacting value @xmath2 .",
    "we use the bethe - ansatz approach for a finite - range interaction potential beyond nearest neighbour in the limit @xmath3 and show that the regime of strong interaction effects ( corresponding to the minimum value of @xmath4 in the tomonaga - luttinger model ) can only be accessed by a microscopic model with the interaction range at least of the order of the average distance between particles .",
