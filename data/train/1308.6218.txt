    "to summarize , extending the standard @xmath33 framework by adding one light sterile neutrino state improves the fit to double chooz data and weakens the lower limit on @xmath20 such that the zero value is allowed at less than @xmath193 c.l .. also , in @xmath25 model , the allowed region and the best - fit of @xmath20 shift to smaller values . from double chooz data ,",
    "the @xmath25 model is favored at @xmath153 2.2@xmath72 c.l . with respect to @xmath33 framework .",
    "however , it should be noticed that even in the @xmath33 framework , the signal of nonzero @xmath20 from the double chooz experiment is rather weak ( @xmath194 ) , and as we saw in section  [ sec : standard3nu ] , the inclusion of daya bay and reno data significantly enhance the signal . in this regard",

    "the following comments are in order about the combined analysis :    * in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi2,combined , q13 ] we show @xmath195 as a function of @xmath20 for @xmath25 model ( blue solid curve ) and @xmath33 framework ( red dashed curve ) , after marginalizing over @xmath31 and @xmath158 .",
    "the @xmath73 range of 13-mixing angle is @xmath201 .",
    "as can be seen , inclusion of daya bay and reno data increases the best - fit value of @xmath20 , such that the zero value of @xmath0 can be excluded by @xmath202 .",
    "the best - fit value of @xmath0 and exclusion of @xmath47 in the combined analysis of @xmath25 model is comparable with the case of @xmath33 framework , although a bit smaller ( see table  [ table1 ] ) . *",

    "[ fig : allowed , combined , q13dms14 ] we see that the global analysis of double chooz , daya bay and reno data in the @xmath25 model excludes @xmath47 with high confidence level ( @xmath208 ) .",
    "also , the best - fit value of @xmath209 is fairly close to the value in @xmath33 framework .",
    "thus , the measured value of @xmath20 is robust with respect to the existence of a light sterile neutrino ; and the daya bay and reno data play an important role in this robustness ( compare fig .  [",

    "[ fig : allowed , combined , q14dms14 ] the closed region indicates that @xmath163 can be excluded at @xmath210 c.l . ; but , however , by increasing the significance the closed region transforms to upper limit and @xmath163 is allowed . * in fig .",

    "this anti - correlation is a manifestation of @xmath212 degeneracy discussed in section  [ sec : lightsterile ] .",
    "the break of degeneracy in low confidence levels ( red and blue curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : allowed , dc , q13q14 ] ) is due to the mismatch of double chooz data and @xmath33 prediction in @xmath213  mev which favors larger @xmath157 . however , by including the daya bay and reno data in fig .",

    "[ fig : allowed , q13q14 ] the green dashed curve represents the limit from the solar and kamland data  @xcite . *",
    "finally we would mention that our results are robust with respect to the uncertainty in the value of @xmath216 , since varying this parameters will change just the positions of the extrema in fig .",
    "[ fig : prob11 ] while the improvement to the data requires additional extrema as in fig .",
    "[ fig : prob4 ] . as a cross check",
    ", we have tested the stability of our results by varying @xmath216 within their @xmath73 uncertainty ranges from the minos experiment  @xcite .",
    "the negligible change in our results justifies the initial assumption of fixed @xmath19 .",
    "searches for the sterile neutrinos and investigating its impact on experimental results obtained , or planned to be obtained , is one of the cutting edge questions in neutrino physics .",
    "although the initial motivation was interpretation of lsnd anomaly by sterile neutrinos with mass  @xmath217  ev , further anomalies such as cosmological hints and low energy solar data stimulated the existence of lighter sterile neutrinos . in this paper",
    "we investigated the impact of existence of a light sterile neutrino , @xmath25 model , on the medium baseline reactor experiments : double chooz , daya bay and reno .",
    "the baseline and energy of these experiments provide the opportunity to probe active - sterile oscillation with @xmath218 .    among these three experiments ,",
    "the double chooz consists of one detector and present both rate and shape ( in energy ) information of observed events ; while the daya bay and reno experiments , each equipped by near and far detectors , provide the deficit in the total number of events in far detector(s ) with respect to near detector(s ) .",
    "the energy distribution of events in double chooz is in good agreement with @xmath33 framework prediction except in the range @xmath219  mev .",
    "this discrepancy leads to a better fit in @xmath25 such that we obtained the best - fit values @xmath220 , @xmath221 and @xmath222 for mixing parameters . with the double chooz data the @xmath33 framework can be excluded at @xmath35 c.l ..",
    "also , the best - fit value of @xmath0 angle is significantly different than the reported value in @xmath33 framework and @xmath47 is allowed in less than @xmath73 c.l ..    inclusion of the rate information from daya bay and reno experiments alters the conclusion such that with the combined data of double chooz , daya bay and reno we obtain the best - fit values @xmath223 with the combined data the @xmath25 model is favored at @xmath36 c.l .. the value of @xmath0 angle is close to the reported value in @xmath33 framework and so robustness of @xmath0 determination can be claimed .",
    "the persisting @xmath212 degeneracy in @xmath25 , which exists in the limit @xmath162 , can be lifted mainly from the data of daya bay and reno . despite the preference for @xmath25 model , a large part of the parameter space of this model",
    "is excluded in our analysis , better than the other constraints by a factor of 2 .",
    "the planned near future data from these experiments can significantly exclude / strengthen the favored nonzero active - sterile mixing parameters found in this paper .",
    "especially , the energy spectrum of data in daya bay and reno experiments can decisively rule out / confirm it .",
    "also , installation of near detector in the double chooz experiment can provide valuable information about the observed anomaly in @xmath219  mev , wether supporting it or contradicting it .",
    "_ note added 1 : _ after completion of this work , the energy spectrum of daya bay data have been reported  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , an anomalous behavior , similar to the double chooz data , in the energy range @xmath224  mev can be identified . however , a detailed analysis taking into account both daya bay and double chooz data is worthwhile .",
    "_ note added 2 : _ before submitting this paper , the article  @xcite appeared on arxiv with results close to the results in this paper .",
    "however , in  @xcite just the rate analysis of the double chooz data is considered and consequently the @xmath224  mev anomaly mentioned in this paper does not show up in  @xcite .",
