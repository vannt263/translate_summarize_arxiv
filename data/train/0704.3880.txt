    "future wireless networks are expected to support a variety of services with diverse quality of service ( qos ) requirements . because of the hostile characteristics of wireless channels and scarcity of radio resources such as power and bandwidth , efficient resource allocation schemes are necessary for design of high - performance wireless networks .",
    "the objective is to use the radio resources as efficiently as possible and at the same time satisfy the qos requirements of the users in the network .",
    "qos is expressed in terms of constraints on rate , delay or fidelity . since in most practical scenarios , the users terminals are battery - powered , energy efficient resource allocation is crucial to prolonging the battery life of the terminals .    in this work ,",
    "we study the cross - layer problem of qos - constrained joint power and rate control in wireless networks using a game - theoretic framework .",
    "we consider a multiple - access network and propose a non - cooperative game in which each user seeks to choose its transmit power and rate in such a way as to maximize its energy - efficiency ( measured in bits per joule ) and at the same time satisfy its qos requirements .",
    "the qos constraints are in terms of the average source rate and the upper bound on the average total delay ( transmission plus queuing delay ) .",
    "we derive the nash equilibrium solution for the proposed game and use this framework to study trade - offs among throughput , delay , network capacity and energy efficiency .",
    "network capacity here refers to the maximum number of users that can be accommodated by the network . while the delay qos considered here",
    "is in terms of average delay , we also derive analytical expressions for the user s delay profile and quantify the delay performance at nash equilibrium .",
    "joint power and rate control with qos constraints have been studied extensively for multiple - access networks ( see for example @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "in @xcite , the authors study joint power and rate control under bit - error rate ( ber ) and average delay constraints .",
    "@xcite considers the problem of globally optimizing the transmit power and rate to maximize throughput of non - real - time users and protect the qos of real - time users .",
    "neither work takes into account energy - efficiency .",
    "recently tradeoffs between energy efficiency and delay have gained more attention .",
    "the tradeoffs in the single - user case are studied in @xcite . the multiuser problem in turn",
    "is considered in @xcite and @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors present a centralized scheduling scheme to transmit the arriving packets within a specific time interval such that the total energy consumed is minimized whereas in @xcite , a distributed aloha - type scheme is proposed for achieving energy - delay tradeoffs .",

    "joint energy - efficient power control and receiver design is studied in @xcite .",
    "in addition , a game - theoretic approach to energy - efficient power allocation in multicarrier systems is presented in @xcite .",
    "joint network - centric and user - centric power control is discussed in @xcite . in @xcite , the utility function",
    "is assumed to be proportional to the user s throughput and a pricing function based on the normalized received power of the user is proposed .",
    "s - modular power control games are studied in @xcite . the prior work in this area",
    "does not explicitly take into account the qos requirements of the users .",
    "while @xcite proposes a delay - constrained power control game , it considers the transmission delay only and does not perform any rate control .",
    "this work is the first study of qos - constrained power and rate control in multiple - access networks using a game - theoretic framework . in our proposed game - theoretic model ,",
    "users choose their transmit powers and rates in a _ competitive _ and _ distributed _ manner in order to maximize their energy efficiency and at the same time satisfy their delay and rate qos requirements . using this framework",
    ", we also analyze the tradeoffs among throughput , delay , network capacity and energy efficiency .",
    "while centralized resource allocation schemes can achieve a better performance compared to distributed algorithms , in most practical scenarios , distributed algorithms are preferred over centralized ones .",
    "centralized algorithms tend to be complex and not easily scalable .",
    "hence , throughout this article , we focus on distributed algorithms with emphasis on energy efficiency .    the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ system model ] , we describe the system model .",
    "the proposed joint power and rate control game is discussed in section  [ prcg ] and its nash equilibrium solution is derived in section  [ ne ] .",

    "we consider a direct - sequence cdma ( ds - cdma ) network and propose a non - cooperative ( distributed ) game in which each user seeks to choose its transmit power and rate to maximize its energy efficiency ( measured in bits per joule ) while satisfying its qos requirements .",
    "we specify the qos constraints of user @xmath0 by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the average source rate and @xmath3 is the upper bound on average delay .",
    "the delay includes both queuing and transmission delays .",
    "the incoming traffic is assumed to have a poisson distribution with parameter @xmath4 which represents the average packet arrival rate with each packet consisting of @xmath5 bits .",
    "the source rate ( in bit per second ) , @xmath2 , is hence given by @xmath6 the user transmits the arriving packets at a rate @xmath7 ( bps ) and with a transmit power equal to @xmath8 watts .",
    "we consider an automatic - repeat - request ( arq ) mechanism in which the user keeps retransmitting a packet until the packet is received at the access point without any errors .",
    "the incoming packets are assumed to be stored in a queue and transmitted in a first - in - first - out ( fifo ) fashion .",
    "the packet transmission time for user @xmath0 is defined as @xmath9 where @xmath10 represents the time taken for the user to receive an ack / nack from the access point .",
    "we assume @xmath10 is negligible compared to @xmath11 .",
    "the packet success probability ( per transmission ) is represented by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the received signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sir ) for user  @xmath0 .",
    "the retransmissions are assumed to be independent .",
    "the packet success rate , @xmath14 , is assumed to be increasing and s - shaped ( sigmoidal ) with @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "this is a valid assumption for many practical scenarios as long as the packet size is reasonably large ( e.g. , @xmath17 bits ) @xcite .",
    "we can represent the combination of user @xmath0 s queue and wireless link as an m / g/1 queue , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1-sys ] where the traffic is poisson with parameter @xmath4 ( in packets per second ) and the service time , @xmath18 , has the following probability mass function ( pmf ) : @xmath19 as a result , we have @xmath20 consequently , the service rate , @xmath21 , is given by @xmath22 and the load factor @xmath23 .        to keep the queue of user @xmath0 stable , we must have @xmath24 or @xmath25 .",
    "now , let @xmath26 be a random variable representing the total packet delay for user @xmath0 .",
    "this delay includes the time the packet spends in the queue , @xmath27 , as well as the service time , @xmath18 .",
    "hence , we have @xmath28 it is known that for an m / g/1 queue the average wait time ( including the queuing and service time ) is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 with @xmath31 being the variance of the service time @xcite . therefore",
    ", the average packet delay for user @xmath0 is given by @xmath32 we require the average packet delay for user @xmath0 to be less than or equal to @xmath3 , i.e. , @xmath33 this translates to @xmath34 however , since @xmath35 , we must have requires an infinite sir which is not practical . ]",
    "@xmath36 this means that @xmath37 and @xmath3 are feasible if only if they satisfy . note that since the upper bound on the average delay can not be smaller than the transmission time , i.e. , @xmath38 , then we must have @xmath39 .",
    "this automatically implies that @xmath40 .",
    "let us define @xmath41 .",
    "then , is equivalent to the condition @xmath42 where @xmath43 with @xmath44 and @xmath39 .",
    "this means that the delay constraint in translated into a lower bound on the output sir .",
    "consider the non - cooperative joint power and rate control game ( prcg ) @xmath45 $ ] where @xmath46 is the set of users , @xmath47\\times[0,b]$ ] is the strategy set for user @xmath0 with a strategy corresponding to a choice of transmit power and transmit rate , and @xmath48 is the utility function for user @xmath0 .",
    "here , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the maximum transmit power and the system bandwidth , respectively . for the sake simplicity , throughout this paper , we assume @xmath49 is large .",
    "each user chooses its transmit power and rate in order to maximize its own utility while satisfying its qos requirements .",
    "the utility function for a user is defined as the ratio of the user s goodput to its transmit power , i.e. , @xmath51 where the goodput @xmath52 is the number of bits that is transmitted successfully per second and is given by @xmath53 therefore , the utility function for user @xmath0 is given by @xmath54 this utility function , which was first introduced in @xcite , has units of bits per joule and is particularly suitable for wireless networks where energy efficiency is important .",
    "fixing the other users transmit powers and rates , the utility - maximizing strategy for user @xmath0 is given by the solution of the following constrained maximization : @xmath55 or equivalently @xmath56 with @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 note that for a matched filter receiver and with random spreading sequences , the received sir is approximately given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the channel gain for user @xmath0 and @xmath62 is the noise power in the bandwidth @xmath50 .",
    "let us first look at the maximization in without any constraints .",
    "based on , we can write @xmath63    the unconstrained utility maximization in has an infinite number of solutions .",
    "more specifically , any combination of @xmath8 and @xmath7 that achieves an output sir equal to @xmath64 , the solution to @xmath65 , maximizes @xmath48 .",
    "proof : notice from that when the other users powers and rates are fixed ( i.e. , fixed @xmath66 ) , user @xmath0 s utility depends only on @xmath67 and is independent of the specific values of @xmath8 and @xmath7 .",
    "in addition , by taking the derivative of @xmath68 with respect to @xmath67 and equating it to zero , it can be shown that @xmath68 is maximized when @xmath69 , the ( unique ) positive solution of @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , @xmath48 is maximized for any combination of @xmath8 and @xmath7 for which @xmath70 .",
    "this means that there are infinitely many solutions for the unconstrained maximization in .",
    "now , considering that @xmath71 must be less than or equal to @xmath3 , the condition @xmath57 is equivalent to @xmath72 let us define @xmath73 note that for @xmath74 , we have @xmath75 and hence @xmath76 . also , define @xmath77 as the rate for which @xmath78 , i.e. , @xmath79 where @xmath80 .",
    "it is straightforward to show that @xmath81 is a decreasing function of @xmath7 for all @xmath82 .",
    "therefore , @xmath83 for all @xmath84 .",
    "this means that user @xmath0 has no incentive to transmit at a rate smaller than @xmath77 .",
    "furthermore , based on proposition  1 , any combination of @xmath8 and @xmath85 which results in an output sir equal to @xmath64 is a solution to the constrained maximization in .",
    "note that when @xmath86 and @xmath70 , we have @xmath87 .",
    "if @xmath64 is not feasible due to the maximum transmit power limitation , the user has to adjust its transmission rate and target sir to satisfy its qos constraints .",
    "in particular , user @xmath0 would choose @xmath88 as its transmission rate such that its transmit rate and target sir such that @xmath89 where @xmath90 this , of course , results in a reduction in the user s energy efficiency .",
    "for a non - cooperative game , a nash equilibrium is defined as a set of strategies for which no user can unilaterally improve its own utility @xcite .",
    "we saw in section  [ prcg ] that for our proposed non - cooperative game , each user has infinitely many strategies that maximize the user s utility . in particular ,",
    "any combination of @xmath8 and @xmath7 for which @xmath70 and @xmath91 is a best - response strategy .    if @xmath92 , then the prcg has at least one nash equilibrium given by @xmath93 , for @xmath94 , where @xmath95 and @xmath77 is given by .",
    "furthermore , when there are more than one nash equilibrium , @xmath96 is the pareto - dominant equilibrium .",
    "proof : if @xmath97 then @xmath95 is positive and finite .",
    "now , if we let @xmath98 and @xmath99 , then the output sir for all the users will be equal to @xmath64 which means every user is using its best - response strategy .",
    "therefore , @xmath100 for @xmath94 is a nash equilibrium .    more generally , if we let @xmath101 and provided that @xmath102 , then @xmath103 is a nash equilibrium where @xmath104 .",
    "based on , at nash equilibrium , the utility of user @xmath0 is given by @xmath105    therefore , the nash equilibrium with the smallest @xmath106 achieves the largest utility .",
    "a higher transmission rate for a user requires a larger transmit power by that user to achieve @xmath64 .",
    "this not only reduces the user s utility but also causes more interference for other users in the network and forces them to raise their transmit powers as well which will result in a reduction in their utilities .",
    "this means that the nash equilibrium with @xmath99 and @xmath107 for @xmath94 is the pareto - efficient nash equilibrium .",
    "we define the  size \" of user @xmath0 as @xmath108 based on this definition , the feasibility condition @xmath109 can be written as @xmath110 note that the qos requirements of user @xmath0 ( i.e. , its source rate @xmath2 and delay constraint @xmath3 ) uniquely determine @xmath77 through and , in turn , determine the size of the user ( i.e. , @xmath111 ) through .",
    "the size of a user is basically an indication of the amount of network resources consumed by that user . a larger source rate or a tighter delay constraint for a user increases the size of the user .",
    "the network can accommodate a set of users if and only if their total size is less than 1 . in section  [ numerical results ] , we use this framework to study the tradeoffs among throughput , delay , network capacity and energy efficiency .",
    "in section  [ ne ] , we defined the  size \" of a user based on its qos requirements . before joining the network ,",
    "each user calculates its size using and announces it to the access point .",
    "according to , the access point admits those users whose total size is less than 1 .",
    "while the goal of each user is to maximize its own energy efficiency , a more sophisticated admission control can be performed to maximize the total network utility . in other words , out of the @xmath112 users ,",
    "the access point can choose those users for which the total network utility is the largest , i.e. , @xmath113 under the constraint that @xmath114 .",
    "based on , the utility of user @xmath115 at the pareto - dominant nash equilibrium is given by @xmath116 as a result , becomes @xmath117 or equivalently @xmath118 under the constraint that @xmath114 .    in general ,",
    "obtaining a closed - form solution for is difficult . instead ,",
    "in order to gain some insight , let us consider the special case in which all users are at the same distance from the access point .",
    "we first consider the scenario in which the users have identical qos requirements ( i.e. , @xmath119 ) .",
    "if we replace @xmath120 by @xmath121 , then becomes @xmath122 therefore , the optimal number of users for maximizing the total utility in the network is @xmath123 $ ] where @xmath124 $ ] represents the integer nearest to @xmath125 .",
    "now consider another scenario in which there are @xmath126 classes of users .",
    "the users in class @xmath127 are assumed to all have the same qos requirements and hence the same size , @xmath128 .",
    "since we are assuming that all the users have the same distance from the access point , they all have the same channel gains .",
    "now , if the access point admits @xmath129 users from class @xmath127 then the total utility is given by @xmath130 provided that @xmath131 . without loss of generality , let us assume that @xmath132 .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath133 is maximized when @xmath134 $ ] with @xmath135 for @xmath136 .",
    "this is because adding a user from class  1 is always more beneficial in terms of increasing the total utility than adding a user from any other class .",
    "therefore , in order to maximize the total utility in the network , the access point should admit only users from the class with the smallest size . while this solution maximizes the total network utility , it is not fair .",
    "a more sophisticated admission control mechanism can be used to improve the fairness .",
    "in section  [ system model ] , we defined the delay requirement of a user as an upper bound on the average total packet delay for that user where the total delay , @xmath26 , is given by the sum of the queuing delay and service time . we have considered a scenario",
    "in which users choose their transmit powers and rates in a selfish and distributed manner such that they maximize their own energy efficiency while satisfying their delay requirements . in section",
    "[ ne ] , we showed that at the pareto - dominant nash equilibrium , the transmit power and rate of a user are such that the delay bound is met with equality .",
    "however , it would be useful to obtain the delay profile of a user so that the deviations of the true delay from the average value can be quantified . more specifically",
    ", we would like to find a closed - form expression for @xmath137 for all @xmath127 .",
    "to that end , let us define @xmath138 as the probability density function ( pdf ) of @xmath26 .",
    "then , we have @xmath139 let @xmath140 represent the laplace transform for @xmath138 , i.e. , @xmath141 it is known that for m / g/1 queues , we have @xmath142}\\ ] ] where @xmath143 with @xmath144 being the pdf of the service time @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "based on , @xmath144 is given by @xmath145 where @xmath146 is the dirac delta function .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath147 as a result , @xmath148 however , obtaining a closed - form expression for @xmath138 based on @xmath140 in is very difficult .",
    "but , recall from section  [ system model ] that @xmath149 based on this we have @xmath150 while finding the inverse laplace transform of is also difficult , we will shortly derive an accurate approximation for @xmath151 . before doing that ,",
    "let us first obtain the mean and variance of @xmath152 and @xmath18 .",
    "for simplicity of notation , we will drop the subscript @xmath0 but it should be noted that all of our results are user dependent . also , we replace @xmath14 by @xmath153 .    based on ,",

    "the service time dominates the total delay .",
    "secondly , for most values of @xmath177 ( i.e. , @xmath182 ) , the standard deviation of @xmath183 is at least ten times larger than that of @xmath154 .",
    "this means that the variations in the total delay are caused mainly by the variations in @xmath184 .",
    "therefore , in many cases , the variations in the total delay can be accurately approximated by the variations in the queuing delay .",

    "the total goodput is obtained by multiplying the source rate by the total number of users .",
    "for example , a user with a source rate of 50  kbps and an average delay constraint of 50  ms ( i.e. , @xmath174  kbps and @xmath212  ms ) has a size equal to 0.072 . as the qos requirements become more stringent ( i.e. , a higher source rate and/or a smaller delay ) , the size of the user increases which means more network resources are required to accommodate the user .",

    "however , this solution does not take into account fairness .",
    "instead , we may be more interested in cases where more than one class of users are admitted .",
    "table  [ table1 ] shows the percentage loss in the total utility ( energy efficiency ) for several choices of @xmath224 and @xmath225 .",
    "it is observed that admitting ",
    "large \" users into the network results in significant reductions in the energy efficiency and capacity of the network .    .",
    "percentage loss in the total network utility for different choices of @xmath226 and @xmath227 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     let us now focus on the delay profile of a user in class @xmath50",

    "the utility function considered here measures the number of reliable bits transmitted per joule of energy consumed .",
    "the qos requirements for a user consist of the average source rate and an upper bound on the average delay where the delay includes both transmission and queuing delays . we have derived the nash equilibrium solution for the proposed game and obtained a closed - form solution for the user s utility at equilibrium . using this framework , we have studied the tradeoffs among throughput , delay , network capacity and energy efficiency , and have shown that the presence of users with stringent qos requirements results in significant reductions in network capacity and energy efficiency . the delay performance of users at nash equilibrium are also analyzed .",
