    "lco is considered as a model system of a spin-@xmath11 quasi-2d heisenberg antiferromagnet on a square lattice .",

    "charge localization of the doped holes is observed below the freezing temperature @xmath16 [ `` spin freezing '' ( sf ) ] which depends linearly on the doping level , as @xmath17k@xmath18 ( ref .  ) .    , the spin freezing temperature of doped holes @xmath16 , and the glass transition temperature @xmath5 are shown in dependence of the sr content @xmath19 .",

    "a complicated interplay between the doped holes in the cuo@xmath10 planes and the remaining af correlations leads to a yet not well understood electronic state with a pseudogap in the excitation spectrum  @xcite . in this doping region , below the freezing temperature @xmath5 spontaneous zero - field precession is observed in muon - spin rotation ( @xmath21sr ) studies  @xcite .",
    "this is often referred to as the `` cluster spin - glass '' ( csg ) phase .",
    "the `` glass '' transition temperature @xmath5 decreases as @xmath22 ( ref .  ) and is also detected within the superconducting phase that starts at @xmath23 .",
    "thin films open the door to new physical properties and phenomena , since electronic or magnetic properties of thin - film structures can be very different from those of the single constituents as found in bulk samples .",
    "phenomena driven by various couplings and dimensional effects may appear .",
    "for instance , the proximity between different orders can be studied in multi - layer systems and superlattices . in different cuprate",
    "heterostructures a giant proximity effect has been found  @xcite , where low doped cuprates sandwiched between superconducting layers , can transmit supercurrent or exhibit a meissner effect over surprisingly large distances at temperatures where these layers are intrinsically in the normal state .",
    "it is usually assumed that the magnetic layers in thin film systems behave as in the bulk material . yet , this was never systematically studied . as a local magnetic probe of thin films low - energy muon - spin rotation ( le-@xmath21sr ) is well suited to address this question  @xcite .",
    "previous studies by this technique of canonical spin glasses  @xcite , metal - insulator lsco superlattices  @xcite , and nickel - oxide superlattices  @xcite showed that dimensional effects might strongly influence the magnetic ground state and its excitations .",
    "in addition , the mismatch between the lattice constants of the thin film material and of the substrate leads to biaxial positive or negative strain in the film .",
    "for example , lsco grown on single - crystal lasralo@xmath2 ( lsao ) substrates are under compressive strain , whereas on single - crystal srtio@xmath24 ( sto ) substrates they are under tensile strain .",
    "epitaxial strain leads to significant changes in the lattice constants of the films ( contraction or expansion ) , which in turn affects the superconducting transition temperature  @xcite as well as the electronic band structure  @xcite .",
    "since both the substrates and the cuprates are essentially ionic crystals , apart from the above `` geometric '' effect ( `` poisson strain '' )  @xcite , there is an additional effect due to un - screened , long - range coulomb interactions ( `` madelung strain '' )  @xcite , which manifests itself as a significant change in the unit cell volume . finally , in a preliminary study by suter _ et al .",
    "@xcite changes were also observed in @xmath3 of lco , depending on the choice of the substrate .",
    "therefore , the question arises how epitaxial strain , potential strain release , and the substrate in general affect the magnetic properties of lsco thin films .    here",

    "since the @xmath36  axis lattice constants of the films are very close to the bulk values , such a strong reduction of @xmath183 is unlikely .",

    "thin films are hence more frustrated which leads to a reduction of @xmath183 , resulting in a lower @xmath3 .",

    "although scco is perfectly frustrated and @xmath204 it shows a @xmath205k  @xcite which is well above that one observed for lco thin films ( @xmath206k , @xmath207 nm ) .",
    "even though geometrical frustration will lead to a reduction of @xmath3 , the observed reduction is too substantial to originate from this source only .    what might influence the magnetic ground state as well are higher - order terms which are present in addition to the dominant super - exchange , like next - nearest - neighbor exchange .",

    ". this could indeed give rise to an increase of @xmath5 as discussed by shengelaya _",
    "et al . _ ( ref .  ) .",
    "this picture is also supported theoretically as discussed in refs .   and   where the influence of short - length - quantum and long - range disorder on the spin-@xmath11 quasi-2d heisenberg antiferromagnet on a square lattice ( qhaf ) is discussed . in ref .",

    "whereas disorder and/or frustration by dilution are directly applicable to zn and mg doping in lsco , it is probably not the case for thin films for which misfit dislocations are the most likely source of disorder .",
    "murthy  @xcite showed that a qhaf is much more sensitive to random fields than to moderate random in - plane couplings .",
    "hence , misfit dislocations due to strain and strain release would have a much stronger influence on @xmath3 as suggested in ref .  .",

    "<S> the magnetic phase diagram of la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 thin - films grown on single - crystal lasralo@xmath2 substrates has been determined by low - energy muon - spin rotation . </S>",
    "<S> the diagram shows the same features as the one of bulk la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 , but the transition temperatures between distinct magnetic states are significantly different . in the antiferromagnetic phase the nel temperature @xmath3 is strongly reduced , and no hole spin freezing is observed at low temperatures . in the disordered magnetic phase ( @xmath4 ) the transition temperature to the cluster spin - glass state @xmath5 is enhanced . </S>",
    "<S> possible reasons for the pronounced differences between the magnetic phase diagrams of thin - film and bulk samples are discussed . </S>"
