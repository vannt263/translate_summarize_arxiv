    "the expression of genes is subject to strong regulation .",
    "the key concept of transcriptional gene regulation is the binding of proteins , so called transcription factors ( tfs ) , to tf binding sites .",
    "these tf binding sites are typically short stretches of dna , many of which are only around 58bp long ( @xcite ) . usually , these tf binding sites are located in a region around 1000bp upstream of the gene they regulate , the so called promoter .",
    "thus , the occurrence of particular @xmath0-mers in these promoter regions has a high impact on modulating transcription .",
    "there have been several experimental studies employing chip - chip or chip - seq technology showing that promoters are rapidly evolving regions that change over short evolutionary time scales ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in a recent review",
    ", @xcite summarizes all these experimental findings and concludes that most tf binding events are species - specific and that gene regulation is a highly dynamic evolutionary process .",
    "many of these changes in tf binding , if not necessarily all , can be explained by gains and losses of tf binding sites .",
    "several theoretical studies have tried to give a probabilistic explanation for the speed of changes in transcriptional gene regulation ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite infer how long one has to wait until a given tf binding site emerges at random in a promoter sequence . using two different probabilistic models ( a bernoulli model denoted by m0 and a neighbor dependent model m1 ) and estimating evolutionary substitution rates based on multiple species promoter alignments for the three species _ homo sapiens _",
    ", _ pan troglodytes _ and _ macaca mulatta _ ,",
    "they compute the expected waiting time for every @xmath0-mer , @xmath0 ranging from 5 to 10 , until it appears in a human promoter .",
    "they conclude that the waiting time for a tf binding site is highly determined by its composition and that indeed tf binding sites can appear rapidly , i.e.  in a time span below the speciation time of human and chimp .    however , in their approach , @xcite rely on the assumption that if a @xmath0-mer of interest appears more than once in a promoter sequence , it does not overlap with itself .",
    "this particularly affects the waiting times for highly autocorrelated words like e.g. aaaaa or ctctctctct . using automata",
    ", we can relax this assumption and , thus , more accurately compute the expected waiting times until appearance for every @xmath0-mer , @xmath0 ranging from 5 to 10 , in a promoter of length 1000bp .",
    "this automaton approach can be applied both for models m0 and m1 . however , for the ease of exposition , in this article we will focus on the bernoulli model m0 .    this article is structured as follows . in section [ sec : models ] , we describe model m0 , state results from @xcite that we rely on and recall how @xcite have estimated model m0 parameters based on human , chimp and macaque promoter alignments . in section [ sec : auto ] , we present our new approach of computing waiting times using automata theory ; we provide in this section a web - pointer to the program used to perform these computations .",
    "section [ sec : bioresults ] compares the results of computing waiting times for @xmath0-mers to appear in a promoter of length 1  kb according to @xcite and to our new automaton approach . for both computations ,",
    "we employ the same model parameters estimations that have been already used in @xcite ; we also explain in this section the biological impact of our findings and show that autocorrelation matters in the context of tf binding site emergence .",
    "section [ sec : linear ] exhibits the first order linear behaviour of the probability of evolution to a @xmath0-mer from generation time @xmath5 to time @xmath4 for specific examples ; the observed phenomena is however general , as proved in @xcite .",
    "we provide in this section a web - pointer to a database containing the waiting times of all @xmath0-mers for @xmath0 from @xmath6 to @xmath7 and for promoter lengths @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] will conclude the article with some summarizing remarks .",
    "throughout the article , we assume that promoter sequences evolve according to model m0 which has been described by @xcite .    [ [ model - m0 . ] ] model m0 .",
    "+ + + + + + + + +    given an alphabet @xmath10 , let @xmath11 denote the initial promoter sequence of length @xmath12 taking values in this alphabet .",
    "we assume that the letters in @xmath13 are independent and identically distributed with @xmath14 .",
    "let the time evolution @xmath15 of the promoter sequence be governed by the @xmath16 infinitesimal rate matrix @xmath17 . according to the general reverse complement symmetric substitution model , we assume that the nucleotides evolve independently from each other and that @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "thus , there are 6 free parameters .",
    "the matrix @xmath24 containing the transitions probabilities of @xmath25 evolving into @xmath26 in finite time @xmath27 , ( @xmath28 ) , can be computed by @xmath29 ; see  @xcite , p. 150",

    "the discrepancy between the two procedures can attain up to around 40% , e.g. ` ccccc ` has a discrepancy of 44% with @xmath46 and @xmath47 , ` ccccccc ` a discrepancy of 43% with @xmath48 and @xmath49 , and ` cccccccccc ` has a discrepancy of 41% with @xmath50 @xmath51 and @xmath52 . strikingly , most of the @xmath0-mers with significant discrepancy feature a high autocorrelation , i.e. they can appear overlapping in so called clumps .",
    "for example , the 5-mer ` ccccc ` could appear twice in the clump ` cccccc ` ( at positions 1 and 2 ) , ` cgcgc ` could appear three times in the clump ` cgcgcgcgc ` ( at positions 1 , 3 and 5 ) . in order to distinguish between different levels of autocorrelation of @xmath0-mers ,",
    "let @xmath53 denote the set of periods of a @xmath0-mer @xmath54 .",
    "a @xmath0-mer @xmath31 is called non - periodic or non - autocorrelated if and only if @xmath55 . furthermore , for a periodic @xmath0-mer @xmath31 let @xmath56 denote its minimal period .",
    "for example , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "we then call a word @xmath61-periodic if and only if its minimal period is @xmath61 .",
    "as can be observed in tables  [ tab : corrank5 ] , [ tab : corrank7 ] and [ tab : corrank10 ] , half of the 5-mers , two - thirds of the 7-mers and all of the 10-mers with @xmath62 are either 1- or 2-periodic , i.e. show a high degree of autocorrelation .",
    "@xcite already investigated the speed of tf binding site emergence and its biological implications for the evolution of transcriptional regulation in detail and we do not want to elaborate on this again .",
    "however , in line with @xcite , we want to emphasize that the speed of tf binding site emergence is primarily influenced by its nucleotide composition .",
    "the goal in the following will be to investigate the impact of autocorrelation regarding tf binding sites .",
    "more precisely , we want to answer the question : do existing tf binding sites show significant autocorrelation or can this aspect be neglected when studying the speed of tf binding site emergence ?    to investigate this , starting from the jaspar core database for vertebrates version 4 ( @xcite ) , we extracted all the human tf binding sites of length @xmath0 , @xmath63 , ending up with a set of 37 position count matrices ( pcms ) for the 37 different tfs in analogy to @xcite . in order to make these pcms accessible for our framework based on @xmath0-mers , we converted a pcm into a set of @xmath0-mers by setting a threshold of 0.95 of the maximal pcm score and extracted all @xmath0-mers with a score above this threshold .",
    "for example , the pcm @xmath64 of the tf sp1 is then translated into the following set of 10-mers : @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 . applying this procedure , in total we obtain 372 different jaspar @xmath0-mers , @xmath69 , for the 37 different human tfs .",
    "we then screened all jaspar @xmath0-mers for 1-periodicity , 2-periodicity , ... , @xmath70-periodicity . to evaluate the degree of autocorrelation of a given jaspar tf given by its set of @xmath0-mers",
    ", we then computed the proportion of 1-periodic , 2-periodic , ... , @xmath70-periodic and of non - periodic @xmath0-mers in this set .",
    "the results are depicted in figure [ fig : jaspar ] .",
    "-mers , the proportion of @xmath61-periodic and non - periodic @xmath0-mers in this set was calculated , @xmath61 ranging from 1 to @xmath71 .",
    "additionally , the same proportions were computed for all possible @xmath0-mers , @xmath0 ranging from 5 to 10 ( `` background'').[fig : jaspar ] ]    as can be seen , some tfs like sp1 , foxl1 , yy1 , gata3 , gata2 and ets1 exhibit a high autocorrelation while 14 of the 37 tfs show no autocorrelation at all ( usf1 , spi1 , ... , ap1 ) . in order to test whether autocorrelated @xmath0-mers are enriched among jaspar tf binding sites , as a background we screened all possible @xmath0-mers , i.e. all @xmath72 , @xmath10 , @xmath0 ranging from 5 to 10 , for autocorrelation in the same way as jaspar @xmath0-mers .",
    "the resulting proportions of periodic and non - periodic words of this background are also depicted in figure [ fig : jaspar ] . in total , among the jaspar @xmath0-mers , there are 168 autocorrelated words ( i.e. words that are @xmath61-periodic for one @xmath73 ) and 204 non - autocorrelated words .",
    "the background set contains 435,828 autocorrelated and 961,932 non - autocorrelated @xmath0-mers . performing fisher s exact test for count data with the alternative `` greater ''",
    ", we obtain a @xmath61-value of 1.119e-08 .",
    "we can thus conclude that autocorrelated words are significantly enriched among jaspar @xmath0-mers .",
    "consequently , existing tf binding sites indeed feature a significant proportion of autocorrelation .",

    "this slowdown can attain up to 40% , e.g. according to @xcite , ` ccccc ` is predicted to be created in a human promoter of length 1  kb in around 6.304  mgen while our more accurate method predicts it be generated in around 9.105  mgen .",
