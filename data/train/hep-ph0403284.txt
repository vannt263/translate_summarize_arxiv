    "the first experimental observation of a new , manifestly exotic baryon ( b=1 , s=1 , originally called the @xmath3 but now denoted as the @xmath4 ) has been reported by leps collaboration @xcite . the experiment was carried out at the laser - electron photon facility at spring-8 in japan .",
    "a sharp baryon resonance peak for the strangeness quantum number s=+1 was found at @xmath5 gev in the @xmath6 missing mass spectrum of the @xmath7 reaction on @xmath8 .",
    "the width of the resonance was estimated to be smaller than 25 mev and gaussian significance of the peak was 4.6 @xmath9 .",
    "soon after the confirmation of this observation was received by several experimental groups @xcite from different experiments where sharp peaks were observed in the @xmath10 and @xmath11 invariant mass spectra at the mass near 1540 mev . as a rule , in all experiments",
    "a width was limited by the experimental resolution .",
    "diana collaboration @xcite reported results from analysis of bubble - chamber data for the charge - exchange reaction @xmath12 where the spectrum of @xmath13 effective mass shows a resonant enhancement with m = 1.539@xmath140.002 gev and @xmath15 9 mev .",
    "the statistical significance of the enhancement is near 4.4 @xmath9 .",
    "a narrow peak in the @xmath16 invariant mass spectrum that can be attributed to exotic baryon with strangeness s=+1 was seen by clas collaboration @xcite in exclusive measurement of the reaction @xmath17 .",
    "this peak is at 1.542@xmath140.005 gev with a measured width of 0.021 gev , which is largely determined by experimental mass resolution , and has a statistical significance 5.3 @xmath140.5 @xmath9 .",
    "the positive - strangeness baryon resonance @xmath4 was observed in photoproduction of the @xmath18 final state with the saphir detector at the bonn electron stretcher accelerator elsa @xcite .",
    "it was seen as a peak in the @xmath10 invariant mass distribution with a 4.8@xmath9 confidence level at the mass @xmath19=1540@xmath144@xmath142 mev with an upper limit of the width @xmath2025 mev at 90% c.l .",
    "itep group @xcite reported an evidence for formation of a narrow @xmath21 resonance with the mass estimated as 1533@xmath145 mev in neutrino and antineutrino collisions with nuclei .",
    "the observed width is less than 20 mev being entirely due to experimental resolution , and statistical significance of the signal is near 6.7 standard deviations .",
    "it is supposed that this resonance arises from neutrino production of the @xmath4 pentaquark baryon .",
    "the performed analysis was based on the data obtained in past neutrino experiments with big bubble chambers : wa21 , wa25 , wa59 , e180 , and e632 .",
    "a new , more comprehensive study of the @xmath4 production on a proton target has been done by clas collaboration @xcite .",
    "two reactions , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , were studied at jefferson lab using a tagged photon beams with energy range of 3.5 - 4.7 gev .",
    "a narrow baryon state with strangeness s=+1 and mass m=1555@xmath1410 mev was observed in the @xmath10 invariant mass spectrum .",
    "the peak s width is close to the experimental mass resolution ( fwhm = 26 mev ) of the clas detector , and its statistical significance is 7.8@xmath141.0 @xmath9 . besides , the @xmath24 invariant mass distribution was analyzed in the reaction @xmath25 too , and no resonance structure was found there .",
    "hermes collaboration @xcite presented the results of a search for the @xmath4 in quasi - real photoproduction on a deuterium target through the decay channel @xmath26 . a peak was observed in the @xmath11 invariant mass spectrum at 1528 @xmath14 2.6(stat ) @xmath14 2.1(syst ) mev .",
    "depending on the background model , the naive statistical significance of the peak is 4 - 6 standard deviations and its width may be somewhat larger than the experimental resolution of @xmath9=4.3 - 6.2 mev .",
    "in addition , no signal for the @xmath27 baryon was observed in the @xmath24 invariant distribution .",
    "the most recent experimental evidence for the @xmath4 came from zeus collaboration @xcite and svd collaboration @xcite .",
    "zeus collaboration presented preliminary results of an evidence for exotic baryon decaying to @xmath28-(anti)proton : a signal at 1527@xmath142(stat ) mev with a gaussian width of 10 @xmath14 2 mev and statistical significance 4 - 5 @xmath9 ( from gaussian fit ) has been observed for both @xmath29-proton and @xmath29-antiproton channels .",
    "svd collaboration also reported an experimental observation a resonant structure with m=1526 @xmath14 3(stat ) @xmath14 3(syst ) mev and @xmath15 24 mev in the @xmath11 invariant mass spectrum in the reaction @xmath30 .",
    "it should be emphasized that the search for baryon resonances with the strangeness s=+1 , that can not be built by three quarks , has a long and interesting history , and first experimental observation of a new , manifestly exotic baryon reported by leps collaboration @xcite was motivated in part by theoretical studies @xcite where baryon s anti - decuplet has been constructed in the framework of chiral soliton model exploiting the old and deep idea of skyrme @xcite .",
    "taking the mass of @xmath31(1710 ) nucleon resonance as input identifying that resonance with the member of the constructed anti - decuplet , it was predicted a mass of @xmath321530 mev and a total width of less than 15 mev for the @xmath3 ( spin 1/2 , isospin 0 and strangeness + 1 ) baryon and pointed out that this region of the masses has avoided thorough searches before . in particular , the s=+1 baryon resonances with a relatively low mass of about 1530 mev have not been searched for in the @xmath33 scattering in the past , probably , because momenta of kaons were too high .",
    "nevertheless , some claims for observing baryon states decaying into @xmath16 and @xmath13 have been made in the past ( see e.g. old particle data group booklets in the middle of 70th ) but they were all with substantially higher mass and larger width than the prediction in @xcite .",
    "since the simplest quark assignment consistent with the quantum numbers of the @xmath4 is ( @xmath34 ) , this baryon is often called pentaquark .",
    "so , the first problem arises how to describe pentaquark states in qcd .",
    "this problem is extremely complicated even though on a pure empirical base e.g. what quark configuration is favorable for the @xmath4 : is it diquark - triquark pentaquark state or this is the state of antiquark and two diquarks or something else .",
    "it is well known that a description of new , recently discovered charmonium meson states with unexpectedly low masses and narrow total decay widths is extremely problematic in the framework of phenomenology based on conventional quark potential models .",
    "now , it appears on a more high level with pentaquark states .",
    "here , a similar story repeats itself : the discovery of exotic baryon with low mass and narrow width brings new , yet more serious problems for that phenomenology .",
    "concerning pure theory , up to now our theoretical understanding of ( especially low - energy ) qcd is far from what is desired",
    ". we do nt know in quantum field theory how to construct even the states for protons and pions though from fundamental quark and gluon degrees of freedom in qcd , it appears to be very complicated and unresolved problem so far .",
    "the best currently performed lattice computations in qcd can not help us to make calculations accurately at low energy too .",
    "nevertheless , there is a hope that powerful computers will allow to overcome many significant technical problems in the future .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , where some of our previous studies were partially summarized , it has been claimed that existence of the extra dimensions in the spirit of kaluza and klein together with some novel dynamical ideas may provide new conceptual issues for the global solution of the spectral problem in hadron physics to create a unified picture for hadron spectra .",
    "the question arises : what place in the unified picture for hadron spectra the @xmath0 baryon takes up ?",
    "this paper presents the answer to that question .",
    "recently a new , very simple and at the same time quite general physical law concerning the structure of hadron spectra has been found ; see @xcite and references therein . the developed theoretical conception allowed to construct the global solution of the spectral problem in hadron spectroscopy and provided quite new scheme of systematics for hadron states .",
    "our approach to hadron spectroscopy has been verified with a large amount of experimental data on meson s states and received an excellent agreement . what is remarkable that all new meson states experimentally discovered last year",
    "have been observed just at the masses predicted in our approach , and those states appeared to be narrow as predicted too .",
    "the main advantage of our developed theoretical conception is that all calculated numbers for masses and widths do not depend on a special dynamical model but follow from fundamental hypothesis on existence of the extra dimensions with a compact internal extra space .",
    "one very important fact has been established now in a reliable way : the size of the internal compact extra space determines the global characteristics of the hadron spectra while the masses of the constituents are the fundamental parameters of the compound systems being the elements of the global structure .",
    "here we apply our approach to analyse the hadron system under consideration i.e. kaon - nucleon system .",
    "first of all , according to the general law , the kaluza - klein tower of kk - excitations for the kaon - nucleon system has been built by the formula @xmath35",
    "where ( @xmath36 ) and ( @xmath37 ) , @xmath38 is the fundamental scale established before from analysis of nucleon - nucleon dynamics at low energies ; see @xcite and references therein for the details .",
    "the such built kaluza - klein tower is shown in table 1 .",
    "some experimental information known from rpp booklet has been presented in this table as well .    for completeness",
    "we have also calculated the kaluza - klein tower of kk - excitations for the @xmath39 system by similar formula like ( [ kkexcit ] ) . that kaluza - klein tower is shown in table 2 together with experimental information extracted from the same rpp source .",
    "we very hope that both tables 1 and 2 might serve as a guide for the experimenters in particle physics .",
    "now we would like to compare the theoretically calculated spectra with experimental material presented in above mentioned papers ; see introduction .",
    "so then , let s see one after another .",
    "diana collaboration investigated low - energy @xmath40xe collisions by the bubble chamber filled with liquid xenon which has been exposed to a separated @xmath40 beam with momentum of 850 mev / c from the itep proton synchrotron .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath41 effective mass was analyzed in the charge - exchange reaction @xmath42 where the neutron was bound in a xenon nucleus .",
    "the events of this reaction were fully measured and reconstructed in space using specially designed stereo - projectors ; the details on the experimental procedure can be found in original paper @xcite .",
    "effective mass of the @xmath41 system formed in the charge - exchange reaction is plotted in fig .",
    "1a for all measured events where an enhancement is clear seen at the mass @xmath43 mev / c@xmath44 . to estimate the level of background",
    ", the effective mass spectrum was fitted to a linear combination of two regular distributions : one distribution was obtained by simulation that took into account many real conditions of the experiment , and a distribution which was obtained by the method of random stars .",
    "the result of the fit is depicted by the dashed line in fig .",
    "1a . after that",
    ", additional topological selections have been applied : see @xcite for details . of the 1112 measured events , nearly a half ( 541 events ) survived the additional selections . in the @xmath41 mass spectrum for these events , that is shown in fig .",
    "1b , the enhancement near 1540 mev / c@xmath44 became more prominent .",
    "in summary it has been concluded that a baryon resonance with mass @xmath45 mev and width @xmath46 mev has been observed in the @xmath41 effective - mass spectrum .",
    "the statistical significance of the signal was estimated as @xmath47 .",
    "it is suggested that the observed resonance is a strong indication for formation of the exotic pentaquark @xmath3 baryon , but the work is still in progress .",
    "vertical , spectral lines have been plotted in figs . 1a and 1b",
    "as well to compare the theoretically calculated spectrum of kk excitations in the @xmath41 system with the picture observed at the experiment . even though we found a strong correlation of the spectral lines with the peaks on the histograms the reported resonance peak appeared approximately in the middle between two spectral lines corresponding to @xmath48(1527)-storey and @xmath49(1558)-storey in kk tower for @xmath50 system",
    "; see table 1 .",
    "let s assume that further , thorough analysis would clarify a matter of dispute .",
    "clas collaboration @xcite has performed an exclusive measurement on deuterium for the reaction @xmath52 where the final state neutron was reconstructed from the missing momentum and energy .",
    "the data have been obtained at the thomas jefferson national accelerator facility with the clas detector and the photon tagging system : photon beams were produced by 2.474 and 3.115 gev electrons incident on a bremsstrahlung radiator , the maximum tagged photon energy was @xmath53 of the electron beam energy , the photons struck a liquid - deuterium target ; see @xcite and references therein for details .",
    "the details on the experimental procedure as well as a discussion of the explicit cuts which have been made to remove the main background sources from the final event sample in order to enhance the signal relative to background can be found in original paper @xcite too .",
    "final result is presented as @xmath10 invariant mass spectrum which is shown in fig .",
    "2 . a fit ( solid line ) to the peak and a gaussian plus constant term fit to the background ( dashed line ) are also depicted in this figure .",
    "the peak is at @xmath54 gev with a width ( fwhm ) of 0.021 gev .",
    "the width is consistent with the instrumental resolution .",
    "the uncertainty of 0.005 gev in the mass is due to calibration uncertainties of the photon tagging spectrometer , the electron beam energy , and the momentum reconstruction in clas .",
    "the statistical significance of the peak is @xmath55 .",
    "the spectrum of events removed by the @xmath1(1520 ) cut is shown in fig . 2 by the dashed - dotted histogram , and does not appear to be associated with the peak at 1.542 gev .",
    "the invariant mass spectrum of @xmath24 system was also examined by clas collaboration using the same event selection as in the case of @xmath10 system .",
    "the statistics were limited , but there was no clear peak in the signal region .",
    "it was noted that the clas acceptance for the @xmath24 system is not the same as for the @xmath10 system , so the two spectra are not directly comparable . the absence of peak in @xmath56 spectrum suggests that @xmath4 is probably an isosinglet , though there is no a firm conclusion based on the current data .",
    "we have plotted in fig .",
    "2 the spectral lines corresponding to kk excitations in the @xmath10 system taken from table 1 . here",
    "it is also found a strong correlation of the spectral lines with the peaks on the histogram .",
    "the reported resonance peak appeared between two spectral lines corresponding to @xmath57(1525)-storey and @xmath58(1556)-storey in kk tower for @xmath10 system though a little bit closed in second spectral line of @xmath58(1556 ) .",
    "saphir collaboration @xcite presented evidence for the @xmath4 in photoproduction of the @xmath18 final state off protons .",
    "actually , the reaction @xmath59 with the decay @xmath60 was measured with the saphir detector at elsa .",
    "the elsa electron beam produced photons via bremsstrahlung in a copper foil radiator .",
    "the tagged photon energies were from 31% to 94% of the incident electron energy which was 2.8 gev for the data presented in this experiment .",
    "the photon beam passed through a liquid hydrogen target .",
    "interacting photons were detected in a photon counter .",
    "the coincidences of tagger and photon counter determined the photon flux .",
    "additional , needed details concerning the experimental procedure can be found in original paper @xcite .",
    "the observation of the @xmath4 in the reaction chain @xmath61 has been presented by fig .",
    "3 showing the @xmath10 invariant mass distribution after cuts ; original paper @xcite contains a comprehensive discussion of all cuts which have been made to arrive at this figure . as is seen from fig .",
    "3 there is a clear peak at @xmath62mev .",
    "the statistical significance of the peak is @xmath63 .",
    "the photoproduction of the @xmath64 final state has been studied by saphir collaboration as well to search for the doubly charged @xmath27 in the reaction chain @xmath65 fig .",
    "4 shows the resulting @xmath24 invariant mass spectrum .",
    "it should be emphasized that the data are consistent with a small structure in the @xmath24 invariant mass distribution .",
    "however , since the saphir acceptance was considerably larger for the fully constrained @xmath64 events they expected a peak with more than 5000 @xmath27 , far above the observed level .",
    "the absence of a signal in the @xmath24 invariant mass distribution at the expected strength resulted in conclusion that the @xmath4 must be isoscalar .",
    "as before we have plotted in figs .",
    "3 and 4 the spectral lines corresponding to kk excitations in the @xmath10 and @xmath24 systems taken from table 1 .",
    "again we found a strong correlation of the spectral lines with the peaks on the histograms .",
    "the reported resonance peak of @xmath4 in fig.3 appears just in the middle between two spectral lines corresponding to @xmath57(1525)-storey and @xmath58(1556)-storey in kk tower for @xmath10 system ( see table 1 ) , and this peak is broad enough .",
    "however , we would like to point out a remarkable fact that the spectral line @xmath66(1555 ) in fig.4 exactly coincided with the experimentally observed structure in the @xmath24 invariant mass distribution . in our opinion further , scrupulous experimental studies of kaon - nucleon system are very desirable , no doubt they would welcome .",
    "itep group reported a search for formation of the @xmath4 baryon in neutrino and antineutrino collisions with protons , deuterons , and neon nuclei @xcite .",
    "the data collected by several neutrino experiments with big bubble chambers  bebc at cern and the 15-foot chamber at fermilab  have been analyzed .",
    "compiled database included about 120 000 @xmath67 and @xmath68 induced charged - current events , and covered the bulk of neutrino data collected with bebc ( wa21 , wa25 , and wa59 ) and a significant fraction of data collected with the 15-foot bubble chamber at fermilab ( e180 and e632 ) .",
    "neutral - current interactions were not systematically included in the database , and therefore the analysis was restricted to charged - current events only .",
    "it has been stressed that neutrino data from big bubble chambers are still unrivaled in quality and completeness of physics information .",
    "further details on the neutrino experiments can be found in original paper @xcite and references therein .",
    "figure 5 shows the @xmath21 invariant mass distribution for the neon and deuterium data combined ( top panel ) .",
    "in the bottom panel the same @xmath21 distribution with bins shifted by 5 mev has been plotted .",
    "a fit of the bottom histogram yielded @xmath69 mev and @xmath70 mev for the position and r.m.s .",
    "width of the resonance .",

    "really , analyzing the excellent neutrino data resulted in excellent agreement with the theory .",
    "recently a more comprehensive study of the @xmath4 production on a proton target which includes data from three distinct runs under different experimental conditions in clas has been reported by clas collaboration @xcite .",
    "two reactions , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , have been analyzed in the three runs having identical geometrical acceptance and trigger requirement but with a slightly different tagged photon beams in the energy range of 3.23.95  gev , 35.25  gev , and 4.85.47   gev , respectively ( details described in @xcite ) .",
    "the combined analysis of these three runs offered access to a wider range of acceptance and energies . the final @xmath74 invariant mass spectrum calculated from missing mass in the reaction @xmath75 , combining data from all three data runs ,",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "the authors concluded that no obvious structure is seen in this spectrum .",
    "figure 7 shows the resulting @xmath10 mass spectrum prepared by applying a several explicit angular cuts . as is seen the @xmath4 peak",
    "was clearly observed in that figure . the @xmath10 effective mass distribution shown in fig .",
    "7 was fitted by the sum of a gaussian function and a background function obtained from the simulation .",
    "the fit parameters are : @xmath76 , @xmath77 mev , and @xmath78 mev ( fwhm ) , where the errors are statistical .",
    "the systematic mass scale uncertainty was estimated to be @xmath79 mev .",
    "it was also estimated the significance to be 7.8 @xmath14 1.0  @xmath9 .",
    "in addition , a search for a manifestly exotic baryon ( @xmath80 , @xmath81 ) was performed in the reaction @xmath82 . using the similar procedures as in previous case ,",
    "the @xmath24 invariant mass distribution was built but there were no resonance structures evident in that distribution .",

    "the event selection included constraints on the event topology to maximize the yield of the @xmath84 peak in the @xmath85 spectrum while minimizing its background .",
    "however , no constraints were optimized to increase the significance of the signal visible in the final @xmath86 spectrum , as such optimization would have produced a spectrum to which standard statistical tests do not apply . to search for the @xmath4 , events were selected with a @xmath85 invariant mass within @xmath87 about the centroid of the @xmath28 peak .",

    "the probability of the 1522 mev signal anywhere in the range 15001560 mev arising from statistical fluctuation of the background was below @xmath119 . for a more realistic case , when the starting background distribution included the 1465 mev gaussian the probability was found to be about a factor of ten lower .    in order to determine the natural width of the state ,",
    "the breit - wigner function convoluted with the gaussian was used in the fitting procedure to describe the peak near 1522 mev . if the width of the gaussian was fixed to the experimental resolution , the estimated intrinsic width of the signal turned out @xmath120 mev .",
    "the systematical error on this width was expected to be smaller than the statistical error , but due to low statistics , complicated background and the narrowness of the peak leading to unstable fits , full systematical uncertainty was difficult to estimate @xcite .",
    "the invariant mass spectrum was also investigated for the @xmath21 and @xmath103 samples separately .",
    "this result is shown as an inset in fig .  11 for @xmath121 gev@xmath44 .",
    "the results for two decay channels are compatible , though the number of @xmath103 candidates is systematically lower .",
    "the mass distributions were fitted using the same function as the combined sample and gave statistically consistent results for the peak position and width .",
    "the number of events in the @xmath103 channel is @xmath122 .",
    "if one considers the signal in the @xmath21 channel as the @xmath4 then the signal in the @xmath103 channel might be identified with the @xmath123 .",
    "this is quite a new , remarkable observation made by zeus collaboration .    besides",
    ", the @xmath124 invariant mass spectra were investigated for a wide range of minimum @xmath107 values as well , identifying proton and charged kaon candidates using @xmath125 in a kinematic region similar to that used in the @xmath105 analysis . for @xmath126 gev@xmath44 , no peak",
    "was observed near 1522 mev in the @xmath127 spectrum , while a clean @xmath128 signal was observed in the @xmath129 channel at @xmath130 mev , corresponding to the pdg @xmath131 state ; see fig .  5 in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath127 and @xmath132 mass spectra were especially investigated at @xmath133 gev@xmath44 , where the 1522 mev peak is clearly pronounced for the @xmath105 channel .",
    "again , no sign of a peak was found in the @xmath127 decays ; see fig .  6 in @xcite .",
    "however , we would like to emphasize , looking at the figures 5 and 6 in @xcite , one can not definitely conclude that no structures are seen in the @xmath127 mass spectra .",
    "certainly , more statistics and higher mass resolution are needed to make a physically adequate statement .",
    "we have plotted in fig .",
    "11 the spectral lines corresponding to kk excitations in the @xmath50 system taken from table 1 . as seen in fig .  11 , the spectral lines of the @xmath134 , @xmath135 and @xmath136 from kaluza - klein tower for kaon - nucleon system may correspond to the observed structures in invariant mass spectra for the @xmath105 channel .",
    "unfortunately , the statistics is small and mass resolution is not so high to make a more reliable statement concerning the structures seen from the left side of the 1522 mev peak .",
    "we also found a strong correlation of the calculated spectral lines with the enhancements on the right side from the 1522 mev peak in the invariant mass spectrum . in this respect , it would be extremely important to improve the statistics and mass resolution of the experiment , below and above of the 1522 mev peak , to confirm the lower and higher new exotic states predicted .",
    "quite an interesting results came just recently from dubna experiment @xcite where the 2 m propane bubble chamber experimental data have been analyzed to search for the exotic baryon decaying to @xmath28-proton in the reaction p+@xmath137 at 10 gev .",
    "the observation of three peaks in the @xmath97 invariant mass spectrum has been reported with the masses @xmath138 = ( 1545.1@xmath1412.0 , 1612.5@xmath1410.0 , 1821.0@xmath1411.0 ) mev and the measured widths of @xmath139 = ( 16.3@xmath143.6 , 16.1@xmath144.1 , 28.0@xmath149.4 ) mev .",
    "the statistical significance of these peaks were estimated to be of ( 5.5@xmath140,5)@xmath9 , ( 4.6@xmath140.5)@xmath9 and ( 6.0@xmath140.6)@xmath9 respectively .    the effective mass distribution for 2300 @xmath140 combination is shown in fig .",
    "the background events were analyzed using the same experimental condition .",
    "the background distribution was fitted by six - order polynomial . the solid curve in fig .",
    "12 represents the sum of the background and 4 breit - wigner resonances . as seen in fig .",
    "12 , there are significant enhancements in 1539 , 1610 and 1810 mev mass regions .",
    "there is also a small peak in 1980 mev mass region .",
    "the total ( 5554 combination ) @xmath140 effective mass distribution is shown in fig .  13 .",
    "the total experimental background was obtained with the same experimental condition .",
    "the significant enhancements are clear seen in fig .  13 in 1545 , 1616 and 1811 mev mass regions .",
    "a small peak in 2.0 gev mass region is pointed out too .",
    "the calculated spectral lines corresponding to kk excitations in the @xmath50 system taken from table 1 have been plotted in figs .",
    "12 and 13 as well . here ,",
    "as in previous cases , we also found a remarkable coincidence of the calculated spectral lines with the enhancements in the invariant mass spectra .",
    "we have presented an analysis of the recent results from several experimental groups reported observation of a new @xmath0 baryon .",
    "our analysis was motivated by the wishes to understand a real origin of the @xmath0 baryon and to find its place in the unified picture for hadron spectra developed early @xcite .",
    "a thorough analysis of all experiments mentioned in introduction taken together shows that , in fact , two different @xmath0 baryons have been discovered : one @xmath141 baryon in the @xmath142 system and other @xmath4 baryon in the @xmath10 system .",
    "it s our first claim .",
    "we have established that both @xmath0 baryons are excellently incorporated in the unified picture for hadron spectra : the @xmath143 baryon lives on the six storey in kaluza - klein tower for @xmath50 system but the @xmath144 baryon lives on the seven storey in kaluza - klein tower for @xmath10 system ; see table 1 .",
    "as is seen from table 1 , almost all experimentally filled storeys in kaluza - klein tower for kaon - nucleon system contain pairs of @xmath2 and @xmath1 particles with negative strangeness .",
    "one might think that @xmath143 baryon represents an isovector with positive strangeness partner of isoscalar @xmath1(1520 ) particle with negative strangeness , and @xmath145 baryon is isoscalar with positive strangeness partner of isovector @xmath2(1560 ) particle with negative strangeness . in this respect",
    ", it would be quite an important to set up purposeful experiments to search for the states @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "it would also be very interesting an attempt to seek a rare decay mode @xmath148 with an isospin violation ( see 8-storey in table 2 ) . from strong correlation between spectral lines corresponding to kaluza - klein tower for kaon - nucleon system and the peaks on the histograms established above",
    ", one can conclude that there exist positive srangeness @xmath0 partners for all @xmath2 and @xmath1 particles with negative strangeness as we predicted  this is our second claim",
    ". the most impressive manifestation and confirmation of that claim we found in neutrino interactions data set @xcite .",
    "our predictions should be tested in the future experimental studies .",
    "the properties of the observed @xmath0 states , such as spin , isospin , and parity are not established in the above mentioned experiments .",
    "so , it is important to measure the quantum numbers of the @xmath0 particles in the future experiments . in our opinion , a classification of baryons by soliton configurations in chiral field theories is more preferable compared to the standard quark model classification . in particular ,",
    "the su(3 ) version of the chiral soliton model @xcite predicts the @xmath4 state of having spin 1/2 , isospin 0 , and positive parity .",
    "attractive in the soliton classification scheme that the @xmath0 baryon is considered on an equal ground with other baryons .",
    "this is ideologically close to our scheme of systematics .",
    "however , our description significantly differs in many important things from the chiral soliton description .",
    "our conservative estimate for the widths of kk excitations looks like @xmath149 mev , where @xmath150 is the number of kk excitation .",
    "this gives @xmath151 mev and @xmath152 mev .",
    "thus , a more careful experimental studies with a higher statistics and mass resolution are extremely important .    here",
    ", we should like to bring up some comments on the problems under discussion .",
    "if one takes the structures below and above of the @xmath0 peak in the @xmath21 invariant mass spectra observed in @xcite seriously , then we come to the conclusion that the experimentally observed picture is not at all what is predicted by the chiral soliton model . as an additional argument in favor of that claim we would like to refer to the recent , interesting article @xcite where a careful analysis of @xmath153 total cross section data was undertaken to explore possible manifestations of the resonance in the s=+1 hadronic system with mass around 1.55 gev .",
    "it was found that a structure corresponding to the resonance is visible in the data .",
    "the width consistent with the observed deviation from background was found to be 0.9@xmath140.2 mev and the mass is 1.559@xmath140.003 gev for the spin parity @xmath154 and 1.547@xmath140.002 gev for @xmath155 .",
    "perhaps this is the first experimental verdict on a crucial problem concerning the quantum numbers of the @xmath0 baryon .",
    "the obtained mass 1.559@xmath140.003 gev for the spin parity @xmath154 is in excellent agreement with the @xmath156(1556mev)-storey in kaluza - klein tower for kaon - nucleon system ( see table 1 ) and far enough from accurate prediction 1530 mev in @xcite .",
    "the mass 1.547@xmath140.002 gev is closer to the prediction 1530 mev but the negative parity ( @xmath155 ) in that case contradicts to the predicted @xcite positive parity ( @xmath154 ) .",
    "we would also like to point out , once again , a noticeable spread among the masses of the @xmath0 states observed in different experiments .",
    "however , it should be noted that the clas collaboration @xcite reported a very small statistical error on the mass of the @xmath4 which is 1555@xmath141(stat . )",
    "the large error in the quoted mass @xcite was due to possible systematic errors .",
    "the mass value 1555@xmath141(stat . )",
    "mev is in excellent agreement with the @xmath156(1556mev)-storey in the kaluza - klein tower for kaon - nucleon system as well , and this might be considered as an additional argument in favor of the spin parity @xmath154 .",
    "certainly , this is a remarkable fact that it may be possible to infer the parity of the state from a comparison of its mass values @xcite . in this respect",
    "a more accurate experimental measurement and precise determination of the masses of the @xmath0 states is a question of vital importance as well .",
    "no doubt , further measurements to obtain a more accurate kaon - nucleon scattering data would be very useful to better establish all possible states in kaon - nucleon system with positive and negative strangeness simultaneously .",
    "we have already claimed that the year 2003 will enter the history of particle physics as a year of fundamental discoveries @xcite .",
    "this concerned a series of new narrow mesons states discovered at the masses which are surprisingly far from the predictions of conventional quark potential models .",
    "exciting experimental measurements in baryons spectroscopy in the same year and next with discovery of the @xmath0 baryon states provided an additional excellent confirmation of that claim .",
    "all of these discoveries in meson and baryon spectroscopy clearly open a new page in hadron physics which is certainly a starting page of a new era in particle physics .",
    "one might think that this is an era of the extra dimensions .",
