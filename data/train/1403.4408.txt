    "mathematical models for the interactions of populations are now classical , @xcite . studies of interacting populations among which diseases spread constitute the object of ecoepidemiology , which dates back to a paper of the late 1980 s , @xcite , and progressed through early works in different biological settings , such as predator - prey models , @xcite , oceanic environment , @xcite , competing and symbiotic interactions @xcite .",
    "the interested reader can consult chapter 7 of @xcite for a fairly recent account on progress of this discipline .",
    "an extension of this situation has recently been proposed , in which the disease is not a basic fundamental ingredient of the ecosystem , but it is replaced by the presence of more than one genotype in one of the populations . in a sense , however , epidemics keep on playing a role in this context , since the genotype itself may make the indivuals carrying it more prone to a certain specific disease . in this respect , these systems are very much related to ecoepidemiology .",
    "they could be referred to as mathematical ecogenetics models , since ecogenetics is very well established discipline of biology .",
    "indeed , it mainly investigates how an inherited genetical variability responds to environmental changes , such as substances present in it , @xcite .",
    "our focus lies instead on the ecosystem behavioral consequences of the presence and interplay of the genetically interesting population with the other populations .",
    "the case of a genetically differentiated prey population subject to predation by their natural predators has been presented and analysed in @xcite .",
    "models for natural situations in which more predators feed on the same prey are well known , @xcite . in @xcite",
    "therefore the study has been extended to the case in which the predators show genetic differences .",
    "bilinear interaction terms have been assumed , corresponding to the standard quadratic model in population theory .",
    "no population oscillations have been discovered .",
    "here we continue the investigation , in the search for possible interesting features in the system behavior .",
    "the model is thus formulated using a holling type ii response function , as the latter better suited to model feeding , which is subject to satiation when too large amounts of prey are present , @xcite . in view of the large number of parameters of the model , a blind search in the parameter space for a configuration that leads to persistent oscillations",
    "is very difficult .",
    "however , we do provide an almost complete classification of all the cases that can arise .",
    "this mathematical effort specifically characterizes this investigation .",
    "it is instrumental to provide guidelines for the parameter choices , and its usefulness is shown by the fact that on this basis limit cycles are indeed found in the numerical simulations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next section contains the model .",
    "the equilibria are studied in section 3 . a thorough classification of the routh - hurwitz conditions in terms of the model parameters",
    "is carried out in section 4 .",
    "the following section contains numerical examples that have been worked out on the experience matured in constructing the previous classification .",
    "a brief final discussion concludes the paper .",
    "let the predators be genetically diversified , with the two genotypes denoted by @xmath0 and @xmath1 , let @xmath2 be the prey population .",
    "we consider the following model @xmath3 here all the parameters are always assumed to be nonnegative .",
    "in this situation , the key factor is here represented by the term in bracket in the last two equations .",
    "it contains both genotypes , meaning that it is the whole predator population that reproduces .",
    "but furthermore , since both subpopulations appear as reproduction factors in both predators equations , this term states that each genotype can give rise to newborns of both genotypes , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote the fractions of @xmath6 and @xmath7 newborn predators , with @xmath8 .",
    "in other words , the fundamental point of this model , that singles it out from other standard models in population theory , states that from the subpopulation @xmath6 , newborns of genotype @xmath7 can be generated , and vice versa .",
    "the reason for the appearance of the term @xmath9 can however be pointed out more precisely as follows . for more generality , the two genotypes are assumed to possibly have different hunting capabilities , here represented by the coefficients @xmath10 for @xmath6 and @xmath11 for @xmath7 .",
    "each predator subpopulation thus independently removes prey at its own rate .",
    "we also assume that the predators experience a feeding saturation effect , which is suitably modeled by a holling type ii response function , where @xmath12 represents the maximum obtainable resource from each prey per unit time and @xmath13 denotes the half saturation constant .",
    "the total benefit from hunting for the predator population is thus represented by the sum of these separate removing contributions for the two subpopulations , therefore giving rise to the first term in the last two equations .",
    "further , newborns are produced by converting the captured prey into new predator biomass , @xmath14 being the conversion factor .",
    "the remaining assumptions are kind of standard in interacting population models .",
    "namely , the predators dynamics further shows a natural mortality , at rates @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively for @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the prey reproduce logistically with rate @xmath17 and carrying capacity @xmath18 and are subject to hunting by the predators , as explained above .",
    "the system ( [ h1 ] ) can be nondimensionalized in the following way .",
    "let @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 e @xmath22 , and choosing @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , we can define the new parameters @xmath26 finally , by letting @xmath27 and @xmath28 , we have the rescaled model @xmath29",
    "the model ( [ h2 ] ) has only three possible equilibria , the origin @xmath30 , corresponding to the system extinction , the predator - free equilibrium @xmath31 and the whole ecosystem coexistence @xmath32 , the population levels of which are obtained solving for @xmath33 from the first equation , substituting it into the second one to give @xmath34 , with the final substitution into the last equation .",
    "this last step produces a factored quadratic , from which once again the equilibrium @xmath35 is found , or alternatively by back substitution , the following values for the coexisting populations are determined , @xmath36 with @xmath37 the feasibility conditions for @xmath38 are @xmath39 , i.e. @xmath40 , and @xmath41 , i.e. @xmath42 , which combine to give @xmath43    the jacobian of ( [ h2 ] ) reads @xmath44\\nonumber\\ ] ]    at @xmath30 its eigenvalues are easily found , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 . since @xmath48 the origin is unconditionally unstable .",
    "this is a positive result from the conservation point of view , since the ecosystem will never disappear .    at @xmath35 instead ,",
    "the characteristic equation factors , to give one explicit eigenvalue @xmath49 , while the remaining ones are the roots of the quadratic @xmath50 with @xmath51 we can use descarte s rule of sign to impose @xmath52 and @xmath53 , so that both roots have negative real part .",
    "we thus find , respectively , @xmath54    * remark*. the feasibility condition for @xmath38 corresponds to @xmath55 , so that when @xmath53 the only feasible equilibria is @xmath35 , given that @xmath30 is always unstable .    in summary , @xmath35 is locally asymptotically stable if @xmath56 note indeed that @xmath57 which holds since it reduces to @xmath58 , which is true since all parameters are nonnegative .",
    "note that the equilibrium @xmath35 changes stability when the inequality in ( [ eqh4 ] ) becomes an equality .",
    "but this coincides with the situation that brings @xmath38 to become feasible , see ( [ sisth1 ] ) .",
    "we have thus discovered that there is a transcritical bifurcation , the coexistence equilibrium @xmath38 emanates from the boundary equilibrium @xmath35 when the parameter @xmath59 attains and crosses the critical value @xmath60 it is illustrated in figure [ fig5 ] , for the fixed parameter values @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 .",
    "the parameter @xmath68 has then been assigned three different values , namely @xmath69 , for @xmath70 .",
    "when @xmath35 is unstable , i.e. for @xmath71 , the system settles at the coexistence equilibrium @xmath72 .    in summary",
    "to seek for possible interesting behaviors of the system , leading to bifurcations , @xcite , we need to investigate the eigenvalues of the jacobian evaluated at the coexistence equilibrium . for @xmath38 ,",
    "the feasibility condition ( [ sisth1 ] ) can be recast in the form @xmath73 the characteristic equation of the jacobian evaluated at @xmath38 is a cubic @xmath74 with @xmath75 and    @xmath76}{vbq},\\quad a_3=\\displaystyle\\frac{rdsw}{bq},\\\\ a_2=\\displaystyle\\frac{rds\\left\\{b(a-1)(s^2v+cd^2w)+(a+1)ds(s+d)+b(wc+v)[w - ds]\\right\\}}{vbq}.\\\\ \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "we apply the routh - hurwitz criterion to ( [ polch ] ) , imposing @xmath77 , @xmath78,and @xmath79 we now study in terms of the parameter @xmath68 each one of the first two conditions and the sign of the coefficient @xmath80 to find and exclude intervals for the model parameters arrangements where the third one possibly does not hold .",
    "the remaining intervals are those in which the stability of @xmath81 may be sought by suitably  playing \" with the parameter @xmath68 .",
    "observe that @xmath78 is always satisfied when @xmath38 is feasible , in view of the conditions ( [ condeq ] ) .      for @xmath82",

    "we study it in terms of the parameter @xmath68 .    if @xmath84 we have easily @xmath77 .",
    "also , if the bracket is positive , positivity of @xmath82 is once more ensured ; this occurs when @xmath85 where the inequality on the right is provided by the feasibility condition ( [ condeq ] ) .",
    "we need still to study the case @xmath86 in this situation , @xmath82 is positive if @xmath87    * remark*. examining each fraction , we clearly see that @xmath88 .",
    "further , if @xmath89 we find @xmath90 .",
    "consequently @xmath77 holds if ( [ a1posfin ] ) is satisfied .",
    "conversely @xmath91 , if @xmath92 in case instead @xmath93 we have @xmath94 and ( [ a1posfin ] ) is always true , so that @xmath77 .",
    "* remark*. note that the quantity @xmath95(ds)^{-1}$ ] , positive by feasibility of equilibrium @xmath38 , is larger than 1 if and only if @xmath96 .    by combining the considerations for the signs of @xmath82",
    ", we have the following four possible situations . in the table ,",
    "the interval ranges contain the possible values of the parameter @xmath68 and in them we explicitly describe the sign of the coefficient @xmath82 , specifying also the intervals in which the equilibrium @xmath81 is not feasible or does not exist by the symbol @xmath97 .    1 .

    ".    now , in this table and in all the ones that we will consider from now on , we need to find the intervals in which the third routh - hurwitz condition may be satisfied , ( [ rh_3 ] ) . in view of the fact that @xmath78 always , we need therefore to identify the intervals in which @xmath82 and @xmath80 have the same sign . among those then , one can search whether the condition ( [ rh_3 ] ) is satisfied .",
    "evidently , from the above configuration , in this case we find the interval @xmath102 $ ] .",
    "this is the candidate where to try for parameter values that will possibly provide a stable @xmath38 .",
    "the interval is found for this particular arrangements of the knots , and this information is also relevant .",

    "this arrangement occurs for combining the cases for @xmath82 and @xmath80 , i.e. ( b,1+,2 + ) .",

    "the next one is the following one : @xmath104\\ ] ]    for @xmath105 , the table is the same : no matter how @xmath68 is chosen , all coefficients are always strictly positive .    as long as @xmath106 , the third routh - hurwitz condition does not hold , thus @xmath38 in the first interval is unstable . from the analyses of the tables ,",
    "we infer the possibility of a hopf bifurcation .",
    "although we do not analytically find the bifurcation value of the parameter , the numerical experiments verify this conjecture .",
    "next , from ( d ) and ( 1 + ) and ( 2 + ) we have the cases corresponding to ( d,1+,2 + ) .",
    "let us recall that @xmath107 .",
