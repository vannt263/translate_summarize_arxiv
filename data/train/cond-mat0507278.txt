    "the recently synthesized isotypic metal - rich ternary borides li@xmath0pd@xmath1b and li@xmath0pt@xmath1b @xcite , with noncentrosymmetric crystal structures , have received considerable attention because of their superconducting properties @xcite .",
    "the superconducting transition temperature @xmath3 of li@xmath0pd@xmath1b is about @xmath4 k , while its isotypic pt - based counterpart li@xmath0pt@xmath1b shows a @xmath3 between @xmath5 and @xmath6 k @xcite .",

    "sardar and sa @xcite have used a three - dimensional single band @xmath16-@xmath17 model to discuss the superconductivity of li@xmath0pd@xmath1b , pointing out that the superconductivity in this compound arises from the pd @xmath18__d _ _ electrons , and thus should be dominated by the strong correlation effects of narrow band pd @xmath18__d _ _ electrons .",

    "the present paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec_electronicstructure ]",
    "we discuss the electronic structure , charge transfer and bonding in the two compounds . in section [ sec_electron - phonon ]",
    "we discuss the electron - phonon coupling .",
    "in particular we provide estimates of the fermi - surface averaged electron - phonon matrix elements ( hopfield parameters ) , and electron - phonon coupling constants .",

    "the positions of the atoms were taken to be the same as given by eibenstein and jung @xcite and used in the electronic structure calculation of chandra _ et al .",
    "the atomic structure is shown in fig .  [ fig_xyz ] .",
    "the shortest bonds are between pd and b ( @xmath22 @xmath21 ) and li and li ( @xmath23 @xmath21 ) .",
    "each b atom is connected to six pd atoms , and each pd atom has two b nearest neighbors . the structure of the pd and b atoms can be described as a network of connected pd@xmath1b tetrahedra @xcite . to show this , in fig .",
    "[ fig_xyz ] we have also drawn bonds for the shortest pd - pd distances ( @xmath24 @xmath21 ) , which are however longer than some of the pd - li distances ( @xmath25 @xmath21 , not shown ) . the three - fold coordinated li atoms form their own network ( fig .",
    "[ fig_xyz ] ) .",
    "because the li - li distances are @xmath26 smaller than in bcc li @xcite , it has been anticipated @xcite that the li atoms transfer their @xmath5__s _ _ electrons entirely to the pd and b atoms .",

    "[ fig_rho](b ) , the total charge density is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig_rho](a ) ] ,    shows indeed that there is very little electronic valence charge present near the li atoms . to see the effect of bonding it is often useful to subtract the atomic valence charge densities from the total valence charge density .",

    "again it is clear that the network of li atoms is depleted of charge .",
    "in addition , a strong increase in the charge density is found between the b and pd atoms , which indicates covalent bonding .",
    "the increase in charge density between the pd atoms is less pronounced , suggesting that b - pd bonds are stronger than pd - pd bonds .",
    "we have carried out the lmto calculation without empty spheres ( which a more rigorous calculation would have required ) using the @xmath27 basis and with the @xmath28-orbitals downfolded . even though our results are not the best possible results within the lmto - asa scheme , a comparison with more rigorous full - potential linear augmented plane waves plus local orbitals ( fp - lapw+lo ) results presented by chandra",

    "@xcite is also very good . in fig .",

    "note that the density of states per atom is almost the same for pd-@xmath29 ( 3.34 states/(ry atom ) ) and b-@xmath30 states ( 3.23 states/(ry atom ) ) in li@xmath0pd@xmath1b . in li@xmath0pt@xmath1b",
    "these numbers corresponding to pt-@xmath29 and b-@xmath30 states are 4.2 states/(ry atom ) and 3.72 states/(ry atom ) , respectively .",
    "the main features of our lmto calculations that are used in estimating the electron - phonon matrix elements in section [ sec_electron - phonon ] are the atom and orbital resolved densities of states , listed in table [ table1 ] .",

    "( 5 ) and ( 6 ) are listed .",
    "we also list the calculated bulk moduli of the two compounds , which can be used to obtain estimates of the debye temperatures and average phonon frequencies for these solids .",
    "the analysis of the electron - phonon coupling and critical temperatures in the two compounds is based on the quantities listed in tables [ table1 ] and [ table2 ] .",
    "for li@xmath0pd@xmath1b the hopfield parameter calculated according to eqs .",
    "( 5 ) and ( 6 ) is @xmath39 ev / @xmath40 .",
    "note that the boron contribution is only @xmath41 less than the palladium contribution .",
    "most dominant contributions come from pd @xmath29-@xmath28 ( @xmath42 ev / @xmath40 ) and b @xmath30-@xmath29 ( @xmath43 ev / @xmath40 ) scattering . although double in number than the b atoms , all li atoms together contribute only @xmath44 to the hopfield parameter @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath45 of the contribution of the li atoms is from the @xmath46 channel .",
    "a few comments regarding the decomposition of the hopfield parameter into atom - resolved parts and various partial wave channels in an alloy are in order .",
    "because certain potential parameters depend on the ratio @xmath47 ( or @xmath48 ) , where @xmath2 is the sphere radius for the atom and @xmath49 is the average wigner - seitz radius of the alloy , the atom - resolved parameters may differ for different choices of the sphere radii , all chosen within the allowable sphere overlaps .",
    "the total hopfield parameter is expected to be independent of the choice of the sphere radii , if these are chosen to keep the asa errors as small as possible , but the partial - wave resolved parameters ( i.e , @xmath2-@xmath30 , @xmath30-@xmath29 etc . )",
    "are dependent on the ratio @xmath47 .",
    "ideally , the lmto calculation for the two solids li@xmath0pd@xmath1b and li@xmath0pt@xmath1b should have been carried out with empty spheres in order to reduce asa errors .",
    "this would have given an improved value of the total hopfield parameter , including contributions from both atomic and empty spheres . despite some asa errors present in our results",
    ", we expect the trends revealed by them to be correct .    in the simplest approximation , assuming isotropic electron - phonon coupling , one can attempt to estimate @xmath50 from @xmath38 using eq .  ( 1 ) , assuming that @xmath51 is the concentration average of the mass of the component atoms in the alloy and @xmath52 is the average phonon frequency for the alloy . to estimate the average phonon frequency we use the prescription of moruzzi , janak and schwarz @xcite , relating the debye temperature @xmath53 to the bulk modulus , atomic mass and the average wigner - seitz radius : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the average wigner - seitz radius in atomic units",
    ", @xmath56 is the bulk modulus in kbar and @xmath51 is the atomic mass .",
    "although moruzzi _ et al . _",
    "@xcite verified the validity of this expression for elemental metallic solids , we assume its validity for the alloy by considering @xmath51 to be the concentration average of the masses of the component atoms . from the lmto calculation of total energy versus volume we find the bulk modulus @xmath56 of li@xmath0pd@xmath1b to be @xmath57 gpa , a value consistent with the bulk moduli of elemental solids pd ( @xmath58 gpa ) , b ( @xmath59 gpa ) and li ( @xmath60 gpa ) @xcite . using @xmath57 gpa for @xmath56 in the above equation we find @xmath61 k. using the empirical estimate @xmath62 @xcite yields an average phonon frequency of @xmath24 thz .",
    "the use of eq .",
    "( 1 ) then yields @xmath63 , a value not large enough to explain the observed superconductivity of li@xmath0pd@xmath1b at @xmath64 k. this could have been foreseen from the small value , @xmath39 ev / @xmath40 , of @xmath38 itself .",
    "the value of @xmath38 for niobium , which has a comparable @xmath3 of @xmath65 k , is in the range @xmath66@xmath67 ev / @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "however , in view of the uncertainties , not only in the frequency value , but the validity of eq .",
    "( 1 ) itself , this value of @xmath50 can not be expected to be more than a coarse approximation .",
    "it is known that even for one - component systems the rigid muffin - tin approximation usually gives values of the hopfield parameter that are lower than those obtained via more rigorous calculations of the electron - phonon interaction ( see table ii . in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for the solids under consideration with a large number of optical phonon branches ,",
    "the extent of underestimation is probably more severe .",
    "what is learnt from the above rigid muffin - tin ( or atomic sphere ) calculation is that the contribution to the electron phonon coupling from both boron and palladium should be equally important , and that from the lithium atoms should be negligible .    following the prescription of gomersall and gyorffy @xcite one could try to analyse the electron - phonon coupling by writing @xmath68 where the subscripts pd and b refer to atom - resolved quantities .",
    "this decomposition is based on the large difference between the pd and b masses , and assumes that li atoms do not contribute significantly to the electron - phonon coupling , as supported by the lmto results .",
    "the heavy palladium atom vibration is assumed to couple to the electrons through zone boundary acoustic phonons and the lighter boron atom vibration is assumed to couple to electrons via the optical modes .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that in the acoustic modes only the palladium atoms vibrate , and in the optical modes only the lighter boron atoms vibrate . instead of guessing the average phonon frequencies in the above equation",
    ", we can estimate the ratio @xmath69 by assuming that the average optical phonon frequency is , to take an example , @xmath70 times higher than the average zone boundary acoustic phonon frequency . with the values of @xmath71 and @xmath72 quoted in table [ table2 ] , we then find @xmath73 , i.e. if the above scenario holds , then the boron contribution to the electron - phonon coupling is larger than the pd contribution . for @xmath74 to be equal to or greater than @xmath75 , in this scenario ,",
    "the average optical phonon frequency needs to be about @xmath76 times or higher than the average zone boundary acoustic phonon frequency . from the consideration of the linear specific heat coefficient @xcite , lee and pickett @xcite",
    "have obtained @xmath77 .",
    "with @xmath73 , this would yield @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "note that the value @xmath80 is not unreasonable , as a full - potential lmto linear response calculation by savrasov and savrasov @xcite yields @xmath81 in elemental fcc pd .",
    "incidentally , the use of the mcmillan expression @xcite : @xmath82 with the coulomb pseudopotential @xmath83 chosen to be @xmath84 , as it is often done , @xmath85 k ( table [ table2 ] ) , and @xmath86 yields @xmath87 k.    the above discussion points out that a description based on conventional ( @xmath2-wave , spin singlet cooper pairs ) electron - phonon interaction should be applicable to li@xmath0pd@xmath1b .",
    "of course a more rigorous calculation of the electron - phonon interaction is needed .",
    "such a calculation is likely to reveal negligible coupling of lithium atom vibrations to the electron states at the fermi level , while the vibrations of the palladium and boron atoms should couple strongly .    according to yuan _",
    "_ @xcite temperature dependence of the penetration depth in li@xmath0pd@xmath1b could be fit by a two - gap bcs model with a small ( @xmath88 k ) and a large ( @xmath89 k ) gap .",
    "thus the claim is that li@xmath0pd@xmath1b is a two - gap bcs superconductor just like mgb@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the fermi surface plots presented by chandra _",
    "_ @xcite show a fermi surface with several sheets : a central large sheet and several smaller ones originating from the four bands crossing the fermi level .",
    "a two or multi band superconductivity is thus conceivable in this material just as in mgb@xmath0 with two distinct sheets in the fermi surface @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath3 may still be dominated by a single band @xcite , particularly in the absence of strong interband scattering .",
    "the inadequacy of the above approach to describe the electron - phonon coupling in li@xmath0pt@xmath1b becomes clear from the much larger value of the hopfield parameter obtained for this compound and listed in table [ table2 ] .",
    "note that the unusually large contribution from boron is partly due to larger difference between the boron sphere radius @xmath2 and the average wigner - seitz radius @xmath49 .",
    "a calculation including empty spheres to reduce asa errors would have changed the numbers in table [ table2 ] somewhat , without changing the results qualitatively . even with the reduced value of @xmath90 ( table [ table2 ] ) , the much larger value of @xmath38 would yield a value for @xmath50 larger than that for li@xmath0pd@xmath1b , implying a @xmath3 that is actually higher than in li@xmath0pt@xmath1b .",
    "this is in clear contradiction to the experimental observation that @xmath3 decreases monotonically as the pt concentration increases from zero to unity    the most serious drawback of the above analysis is the neglect of so coupling , which is more pronounced in li@xmath0pt@xmath1b than in li@xmath0pd@xmath1b .",
    "so coupling , in the absence of the center of inversion symmetry in these two compounds , can result in substantial splittings of the spin degenerate bands considered in this work . in a recent submission , lee and pickett @xcite discuss so coupled bands in both compounds : splitting of the spin degenerate bands is found to be as large as @xmath91 mev and @xmath92 mev at the fermi level in li@xmath0pd@xmath1b and li@xmath0pt@xmath1b , respectively .",
    "the so splitting of @xmath91 mev or @xmath93 k in li@xmath0pd@xmath1b is less than the estimated debye temperature @xmath94 k , the cut - off energy of the electron - phonon interaction .",
    "in li@xmath0pt@xmath1b the so splitting is @xmath92 mev or @xmath95 k , an order of magnitude larger than the estimated debye temperature @xmath96 k. it is clear that so coupling would strongly alter the symmetry of the cooper pairs , and the nature of the superconducting state in li@xmath0pt@xmath1b @xcite .",
    "yuan _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have claimed evidence of line of nodes in the energy gap in li@xmath0pt@xmath1b .",
    "such a line of zeros in the energy gap is also seen in cept@xmath1si @xcite , another noncentrosymmetric crystal with strong so splitting of the spin degenerate bands @xcite .",
    "the existence of the line of nodes is not a symmetry - imposed requirement and remains to be explained for both li@xmath0pt@xmath1b and cept@xmath1si .",
    "cept@xmath1si is a heavy fermion superconductor ( @xmath97 k ) , so the mechanism of the pair formation is unclear .",
    "li@xmath0pt@xmath1b is most probably an electron - phonon superconductor , where the electron - phonon coupling needs to be determined from the so coupled electron wavefunctions and is expected to differ strongly from that determined from the spin degenerate wavefunctions .",
    "the results presented in this work are not rigorous , and should only be used as a guide to understand the relative strengths of coupling of the vibration of the different atoms to the electron states at the fermi level .",
    "based on these results , a description of superconductivity assuming conventional @xmath2-wave electron - phonon coupling and via a single electron - phonon coupling parameter appears possible in li@xmath0pd@xmath1b .",
    "the inclusion of so coupling in the calculation of electron - phonon interaction should lead to improvement in results .",
    "for li@xmath0pt@xmath1b the so effects are an order of magnitude stronger and do need to be included in the calculation of the electron - phonon interaction in order to explain the lower @xmath3 in this compound .    the trends and the conclusions reached for li@xmath0pd@xmath1b in this work should be tested via rigorous calculation of the phonon frequencies and electron - phonon interaction .",
    "this is particularly important in view of the large number of phonon branches in this material .",
    "the results of this paper indicate that only the modes where the boron and the palladium atoms vibrate should couple to the electrons",
    ". the electron - phonon coupling should be equally strong for the modes where essentially the pd atoms or the b atoms vibrate . according to our analysis",
    "the modes involving the vibrations of the li atoms should show negligible coupling to electron states at the fermi level .",
    "this is also suggested by our finding that almost the entire valence charge of lithium is transferred to the pd - b complex ( section [ sec_electronicstructure ] ) .",
    "recent work of lee and pickett @xcite also supports this conclusion .",
    "first principles linear response calculations of the phonons and electron - phonon coupling to verify the results of the present work are currently in progress .    due to the strong so coupling in li@xmath0pt@xmath1b the properties of the superconducting state is expected to deviate strongly from that described by spin - degenerate wavefunctions @xcite . however , superconductivity should still be of the electron - phonon type ( possibly also spin - singlet type , as suggested by lee and pickett @xcite ) . the experimental result that @xmath3 decreases monotonically in solid solutions",
    "li@xmath0b(pd@xmath7pt@xmath8)@xmath1 as the pt concentration increases from zero to @xmath11 indicates that the mechanism of electron pair formation remains unchanged , i.e. of the electron - phonon type .",

    "<S> the contribution of the lithium atoms to the electron - phonon coupling is found to be negligible , while both boron and palladium atoms contribute equally strongly to the hopfield parameter . </S>",
    "<S> there is a significant transfer of charge from lithium , almost the entire valence charge , to the b - pd(pt ) complex . </S>",
    "<S> the electronic structure and superconducting properties of li@xmath0pd@xmath1b , thus , can be understood from the viewpoint of the compound being composed of a connected array of b - pd tetrahedra decoupled from the backbone of li atoms , which are connected by relatively short bonds . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that conventional @xmath2-wave electron - phonon interaction without explicit consideration of so coupling can explain qualitatively the observed @xmath3 in li@xmath0pd@xmath1b . </S>",
