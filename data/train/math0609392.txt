    "there is a common prejudice which makes us implicitly associate a metric of constant positive curvature to a sphere , a metric of constant zero curvature to a torus , and a metric of constant negative curvature to a surface of higher genus .",
    "actually , any surface can be endowed with a flat metric , no matter what the genus of this surface is ... with the only reservation that this flat metric will have several singular points .",
    "imagine that our surface is made from plastic",
    ". then we can flatten it from the sides pushing all curvature to some small domains ; making these domains smaller and smaller we can finally concentrate all curvature at several points .    consider the surface of a cube .",
    "it gives an example of a perfectly flat sphere with eight conical singularities corresponding to eight vertices of the cube .",
    "note that our metric is nonsingular on edges : taking a small neighborhood of an interior point of an edge and unfolding it we get a domain in a euclidean plane , see  fig .",
    "[ zorich : fig : cube ] .",
    "the illusion of degeneration of the metric on the edges comes from the singularity of the embedding of our flat sphere into the euclidean space @xmath0",
    ".    however , the vertices of the cube correspond to actual _ conical singularities _ of the metric . taking a small neighborhood of a vertex we see that it is isometric to a neighborhood of the vertex of a cone .",
    "a flat cone is characterized by the _ cone angle _ : we can cut the cone along a straight ray with an origin at the vertex of the cone , place the resulting flat pattern in the euclidean plane and measure the angle between the boundaries , see  fig .",
    "[ zorich : fig : cube ] .",
    "say , any vertex of the cube has cone angle @xmath1 which is easy to see since there are three squares adjacent to any vertex , so a neighborhood of a vertex is glued from three right angles .    having a manifold ( which is in our case just a surface ) endowed with a metric it is quite natural to study _ geodesics _ , which in a flat metric are locally isometric to straight lines .    describe the behavior of a generic geodesic on a flat surface .",

    "] on a typical ( in any reasonable sense ) flat surface .    does any ( almost any ) flat surface has at least one closed geodesic which does not pass through singular points ?    if yes , are there many closed geodesics like that ?",
    "namely , find the asymptotics for the number of closed geodesics shorter than @xmath2 as the bound @xmath2 goes to infinity .",
    "believe it or not there has been no ( even partial ) advance in solving this problem . the problem remains open even in the simplest case , when a surface is a sphere with only three conical singularities ; in particular , it is not known , whether any ( or even almost any ) such flat sphere has _ at least one _ closed geodesic .",
    "note that in this particular case , when a flat surface is a flat sphere with three conical singularities the problem is a reformulation of the corresponding billiard problem which we shall discuss in sect .",
    "[ zorich : ss : billiards : in : polygons ] .",
    "a general flat surface with conical singularities much more resembles a general riemannian manifold than a flat torus .",
    "the reason is that it has nontrivial _",
    "locally a flat surface is isometric to a euclidean plane which defines a _ parallel transport _ along paths on the surface with punctured conical points .",
    "a parallel transport along a path homotopic to a trivial path on this punctured surface brings a vector tangent to the surface to itself .",
    "however , if the path is not homotopic to a trivial one , the resulting vector turns by some angle .",
    "say , a parallel transport along a small closed path around a conical singularity makes a vector turn exactly by the cone angle , see fig .",

    "( exercise : perform a parallel transport of a vector around a vertex of a cube . )",
    "nontrivial linear holonomy forces a generic geodesic to come back and to intersect itself again and again in different directions ; geodesics on a flat torus ( which has trivial linear holonomy ) exhibit radically different behavior .",
    "having chosen a direction to the north , we can transport it to any other point of the torus ; the result would not depend on the path . a geodesic on the torus emitted in some direction will forever keep going in this direction .",
    "it will either close up producing a regular closed geodesic , or will never intersect itself . in the latter case it will produce a dense irrational winding line on the torus .",
    "fortunately , the class of flat surfaces with trivial linear holonomy is not reduced to flat tori .",
    "since we can not advance in the general problem from the previous section , from now on we confine ourselves to the study of these _ very flat _ surfaces ( often called _ translation surfaces _ ) : that is , to closed orientable surfaces endowed with a flat metric having a finite number of conical singularities and having trivial linear holonomy .",
    "triviality of linear holonomy implies , in particular , that all cone angles at conical singularities are integer multiples of @xmath3 .",
    "locally a neighborhood of such a conical point looks like a `` _ _ monkey saddle _ _ '' , see fig .",
    "[ zorich : fig : monkey : saddle ] .    as",
    "a first example of a nontrivial very flat surface consider a regular octagon with identified opposite sides .",
    "since identifications of the sides are isometries , we get a well - defined flat metric on the resulting surface . since in our identifications we used only parallel translations ( and no rotations ) , we , actually , get a very flat ( translation ) surface . it is easy to see ( check it ! ) that our gluing rules identify all vertices of the octagon producing a single conical singularity .",
    "the cone angle at this singularity is equal to the sum of the interior angles of the octagon , that is to @xmath4 .",
    "figure  [ zorich : fig : octagon : to : pretzel ] is an attempt to convince the reader that the resulting surface has genus two .",
    "we first identify the vertical sides and the horizontal sides of the octagon obtaining a torus with a hole of the form of a square . to simplify the drawing we slightly cheat :",
    "namely , we consider another torus with a hole of the form of a square , but the new square hole is turned by @xmath5 with respect to the initial one .",
    "identifying a pair of horizontal sides of the hole by an isometry we get a torus with two holes ( corresponding to the remaining pair of sides , which are still not identified ) .",
    "finally , isometrically identifying the pair of holes we get a surface of genus two .",

    "flat surface _ we mean a closed oriented surface with a flat metric having a finite number of conical singularities , such that the metric has trivial linear holonomy .",
    "moreover , we always assume that the flat surface is endowed with a distinguished direction ; we refer to this direction as the `` direction to the north '' or as the `` _ _ vertical direction _ _ '' .    the convention above implies , in particular , that if we rotate the octagon from fig .",

    "<S> various problems of geometry , topology and dynamical systems on surfaces as well as some questions concerning one - dimensional dynamical systems lead to the study of closed surfaces endowed with a flat metric with several cone - type singularities . </S>",

    "<S> one can obtain much information about the geometry and dynamics of an individual flat surface by studying both its orbit under the teichmller geodesic flow and under the linear group action . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the teichmller geodesic flow plays the role of a time acceleration machine ( renormalization procedure ) which allows to study the asymptotic behavior of interval exchange transformations and of surface foliations .    </S>",
