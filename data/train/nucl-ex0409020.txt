    "breakup reactions have played key roles in investigating the properties of weakly - bound halo nuclei over the past decade  @xcite .",
    "the breakup reaction on a light target , induced predominantly by the nuclear interaction , is characterized by an unusually narrow momentum distribution of a core fragment and an enhanced reaction cross section , reflecting the extended neutron halo structure .",
    "indeed , the halo structure was first uncovered for @xmath0li by observing the enhanced interaction cross section for this nucleus  @xcite , and the narrow momentum distribution of @xmath11li following the breakup of @xmath0li on a carbon target  @xcite .",
    "in addition to these techniques , more recently , the one nucleon knockout reaction in coincidence with @xmath12 rays from the core fragment has been successfully used to determine spectroscopic factors of halo states  @xcite .",
    "the breakup reaction of halo nuclei on a heavy target predominantly occurs as coulomb breakup ( coulomb dissociation ) .",
    "this reaction is of particular interest due to substantially enhanced coulomb breakup cross sections found for halo nuclei  @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon was first interpreted as the presence of a soft electric dipole ( e1 ) resonance  @xcite , which occurs as a vibration of the core against halo due to the low density of the halo cloud .",
    "more recently , by using kinematically complete measurements of the coulomb breakup , spectra of electric dipole strength ( @xmath4 ) have been directly obtained for one - neutron halo nuclei @xmath0be",
    "@xcite and @xmath13c  @xcite , and two - neutron halo nuclei @xmath14he",
    "@xcite , @xmath0li  @xcite , and @xmath15be  @xcite .",
    "it was found that for these halo nuclei a strong e1 strength of the order of 1  w.u.(weisskopf unit ) was observed at very low excitation energies of about 1  mev . however , the mechanism for such large e1 strength was not due to a soft dipole resonance , but rather due to a direct breakup into the continuum , as shown by our earlier study of the coulomb breakup of @xmath0be  @xcite . in the direct breakup mechanism ,",
    "the observed enhancement of the e1 strength is interpreted as follows : the @xmath4 distribution is described approximately as a fourier transform of @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the radial coordinate of the neutron and @xmath18 the radial component of the wave function of the halo neutron  @xcite .",
    "the large value of @xmath19 at large @xmath17 in a halo nucleus thus leads to a large e1 strength at low excitation energies .",
    "in fact , the @xmath4 distribution can be used to determine @xmath18 by inverse fourier transformation  @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we will show the results of a new , full kinematical measurement of the breakup reactions of @xmath0be with a heavy target ( lead ) where coulomb breakup dominates , and with a light target ( carbon ) where nuclear breakup dominates .",
    "we aim at a comprehensive understanding of the reaction mechanism of the breakup reactions both on heavy and light targets , thereby establishing a way of doing spectroscopy of halo nuclei by the breakup reactions , both for the ground state as well as for excited states in the continuum .    for the breakup with a pb target , we focus mainly on extracting the coulomb breakup component by using the information on the scattering angle , which is approximately inversely proportional to the impact parameter of the reaction .",
    "the analysis incorporating the scattering angle dependence has been obtained with much more statistics ( more than 30 times ) as compared to the previous experiment  @xcite .",
    "the contribution of the nuclear breakup component and higher order effects in the breakup with a heavy target have recently drawn much attention .",
    "in fact , quite a few theoretical papers have suggested the necessity of careful treatments of these contributions  @xcite beyond the direct breakup mechanism based on a semi - classical first - order perturbation theory ( equivalent photon method ) which we successfully applied in the analysis of the previous experiment  @xcite .",
    "for instance , a much larger nuclear contribution than the conventional estimation made by scaling the breakup cross section with the data obtained with a light target has been suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this article , we prove that the direct breakup mechanism with the first - order coulomb breakup is dominant , and the small nuclear contribution and higher order effects can be well controlled using the angular distribution of the center - of - mass system of @xmath1be  +  @xmath20 .",
    "this technique will thus offer a powerful spectroscopic tool that can extract precisely the halo wave function @xmath18 .    for the breakup with a c target , we focus on investigating the excitation of discrete resonant states by using the information of the excitation energy spectrum in combination with the scattering angle .",
    "thereby , we aim at establishing a spectroscopic method to study the narrow discrete states in the continuum .",
    "such states are hardly observed in the breakup with a heavy target due to the large direct - breakup contribution .",
    "we also examine the structureless part of the energy spectrum with the scattering angle distribution which is used to disentangle the reaction mechanism with the light target .",
    "the @xmath0be nucleus is a suitable test case for these studies since ground state properties are well known .",
    "for example , the one - neutron separation energy @xmath21 is precisely known to be 504  @xmath3  4 kev  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the simple one - neutron halo structure of @xmath0be has an advantage over two - neutron halo nuclei such as @xmath0li because the reaction mechanisms do not suffer from the complexity which may arise from the two - neutron halo correlations .",
    "the breakup reactions of @xmath0be on targets from light to heavy mass have been studied by r.  anne _ et al . _",
    "the authors used mainly the inclusive neutron angular distributions .",
    "more recently , breakup reactions for @xmath0be have been studied at gsi in a full - kinematical way using pb and c targets and at high energy , 520  mev / nucleon  @xcite .",
    "our present approach is a full - kinematical one .",
    "we can extract the excitation energy spectrum as well as the scattering angle of the c.m .",
    "( center of mass ) system of @xmath1be and neutron .",
    "in particular , in this paper we emphasize the importance of the information on the scattering angle , which was not discussed in the gsi data .",
    "in addition , we have performed the experiment at a much lower energy as compared to the one at gsi , bringing in additional information on the reaction mechanism .",
    "we organize the paper as follows : section  [ method ] describes the experimental method .",
    "section  [ setup ] describes the experimental setup . in sec .",
    "[ results ] the results for breakup of @xmath0be on pb and c targets are presented with detailed discussions including theoretical comparisons .",
    "then , in sec .  [ summary ] , the conclusions are given .",
    "in the current experiment , we made a coincidence measurement of the momentum vectors of the incoming @xmath0be , outgoing @xmath1be , and neutron to deduce the relative energy @xmath22 between @xmath1be and the neutron , and the scattering angle @xmath23 of the c.m .",
    "system of @xmath1be  +  n. here we describe the features characteristic of the invariant mass method which has been used to extract @xmath22 , and the method to extract @xmath23 .",
    "the relative energy @xmath22 between @xmath1be and the neutron , which is related to the excitation energy @xmath5 of @xmath0be by @xmath24 , can be extracted by using the invariant mass method .",
    "the invariant mass @xmath25 of the intermediate excited state of @xmath0be is determined by measuring the momentum vectors , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , of the outgoing particles @xmath1be and neutron , respectively .",
    "namely , @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 stand for the total energy of the @xmath1be fragment and the neutron , respectively .",
    "the relative energy @xmath22 between @xmath1be and the neutron is then determined as , @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 denote the mass of @xmath1be and of the neutron , respectively .",
    "the advantage of the invariant mass method is that the energy resolution is as good as about a few hundred kev at @xmath22  =  1  mev .",
    "this is due to the fact that the invariant mass is a function of four momenta of the outgoing particles , and is not affected by the widely spread secondary beam . in this sense , this method is appropriate for radioactive beam experiments .",
    "the good energy resolution is also attributed to the fact that @xmath22 is determined by the opening angle and the relative velocity between the outgoing @xmath1be and the neutron . in this case , the opening angle resolution of 10  mrad and the relative velocity resolution of 1% , which are easily achievable , can yield a good energy resolution of a few hundred kev at @xmath22  =  1  mev .",
    "this is different from the missing mass method , where the resolution is determined by the value of the total mass which is of the order of tens of gev .",
    "thus , an energy resolution of the order of 10  mev , even with the momentum resolution of the order of 0.1% , can only be achieved .",
    "further advantages are the kinematical focusing and the availability of a thick target since the projectile has rather high velocity of more than 0.3@xmath34 for intermediate incident energies .",
    "relatively small detectors can thus cover most of the acceptance , which is very important in radioactive beam experiments as well .",
    "it should be noted that there is a possibility that the @xmath1be fragment is produced in an excited state . in this case , a @xmath12 ray emission follows the reaction process and has been measured in the gsi experiment  @xcite .",
    "the excitation energy in this case has to be modified to @xmath5  =  @xmath22  +  @xmath21  +  @xmath35 , where @xmath35 stands for the energy of the deexcitation @xmath12 ray from the daughter nucleus @xmath1be . in the current work ,",
    "we did not use @xmath12 ray detectors .",
    "however , the probability of obtaining an excited @xmath1be , where the lowest excited state is located as high as 3.37  mev , is very small for the coulomb breakup process due to very small virtual photon numbers for this high excitation energy .",
    "since the ratio of the virtual photon number at higher @xmath5 to that at lower @xmath5 is smaller for lower incident energies , this probability is even smaller in our case .",
    "in fact , this contribution is estimated to be less than 3% at the present incident energy of 69  mev / nucleon compared to 6% observed at 520  mev / nucleon  @xcite .",
    "the selection of large impact parameters done in the current analysis further reduces this number , leading to a negligible contribution resulting from the excited @xmath1be states . for the breakup with a light target , the gsi experiment found about 17% contribution of the non ground state component , and thus the treatment required additional care .",
    "the exclusive measurement of an incident @xmath0be momentum @xmath36 in addition to @xmath26 and @xmath27 allowed us to extract the scattering angle @xmath23 of the c.m .",
    "system of @xmath1be+n .",
    "this angle is determined by the opening angle between the direction of @xmath36 and that of the outgoing momentum vector of the center of mass obtained by @xmath37 . here",
    ", the scattering angle @xmath23 is defined in the center of mass frame of the projectile and target .",
    "since we are dealing with a small relative energy of less than 5  mev compared to the total kinetic energy of about 770  mev , the angle determined in this way represents the inelastic scattering angle of @xmath0be on the pb or c target with very good approximation .",
    "for the coulomb breakup , the scattering angle is directly related to the impact parameter as will be shown for the semi - classical approximation .",
    "for the nuclear breakup , the scattering angle is used mainly to determine the orbital angular momentum transfer @xmath8 in the transition to a given discrete state , and thus can be used to assign the spin - parity @xmath38 of the excited state .",
    "the experiment was performed at the riken accelerator research facility ( rarf ) .",
    "a secondary radioactive beam of @xmath0be was produced by fragmentation of a @xmath39o primary beam at 100  mev / nucleon in a thick be target .",
    "the secondary beam was separated using the rips fragment separator  @xcite , where an achromatic wedge - shaped energy degrader was installed at the intermediate dispersive focal plane to adjust the secondary beam energies to about 70  mev / nucleon and to purify the secondary beam .",
    "the typical beam intensity was restricted to about 5@xmath4010@xmath41 particles / sec by setting the momentum slit down to @xmath420.1% in order to meet the counting capabilities of the detectors .",
    "the resulting @xmath0be beam with a purity of about 99% was delivered to the experimental setup shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig_setup ] .",
    "the @xmath0be ion bombarded a @xmath43pb target with a thickness of 224 mg / cm@xmath6 or @xmath43c target with a thickness of 376  mg / cm@xmath6 .",
    "in addition , a no - target run was performed to subtract the background events generated by materials other than the target .",
    "the energy of the incident @xmath0be particle was determined from the time of flight ( tof ) , measured with two thin plastic scintillators with a thickness of 1  mm which were placed 4.57  m apart along the beam line .",
    "the average beam energy at the mid - plane of the target was 68.7  mev / nucleon and 67.0  mev / nucleon , respectively for the pb and c targets .",
    "the position and angle of @xmath0be incident on the target were measured with two sets of multi - wire drift chambers ( bdc ) .",
    "the energy and angle of the incident particle were combined to reconstruct the momentum vector of the projectile , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath36 .        the breakup particles , @xmath1be and @xmath20 were emitted in a narrow cone at forward angles with velocities close to that of the @xmath0be incident ion .",
    "the neutrons were detected by the two layers of a neutron hodoscope array ( neut ) , which has an active area of 214(h)@xmath4092(v)cm@xmath6 and a depth of 6.1  cm for each layer .",
    "the front faces of neut were placed at 460 cm and 499 cm downstream of the target .",
    "the detector covered an angular range from @xmath45 degrees to @xmath46 degrees in the horizontal direction , and @xmath35.6 degrees in the vertical directions .",
    "neut consists of 30 plastic scintillator rods ( 15 rods for each layer ) .",
    "each detector has a dimension of 6.1 cm(d )  @xmath40  6.1 cm(v )  @xmath40  214  cm(h ) , coupled to two photomultiplier tubes on both ends .",
    "the front side of neut was equipped with a thin layer of plastic scintillators ( veto ) set in order to reject the charged particle background .",
    "the tof information of the neutron was obtained by taking the mean value of the two timings of the fired detector of neut .",
    "the horizontal position was obtained by taking the difference of the two timings .",
    "the vertical position was determined by the position of the fired rod .",
    "the momentum vector @xmath27 was thus reconstructed from the position and tof information of these detectors .",
    "the momentum resolution ( 1@xmath47 ) of the neutron in the projectile rest frame was 1.7% and 2.0% for the pb and c targets , respectively .",
    "the intrinsic neutron detection efficiency of 13.4% for the threshold energy 6  mevee ( electron - equivalent ) was obtained from a separate experiment using the @xmath48li(@xmath49)@xmath48be reaction at 66.7  mev .",
    "this energy threshold was used to reject all the @xmath12-ray related events .    the @xmath1be fragment emitted in the reaction",
    "was bent by a large - gap dipole magnet , was traced by the multi - wire drift chamber ( fdc ) located downstream of the magnet , and penetrated the hodoscope ( hod ) which consists of 7 plastic scintillator slats of 1  cm thickness .",
    "particle identification was performed by combining @xmath50 and tof information from the hodoscope with the magnetic rigidity information from the tracking .",
    "the momentum vector of @xmath1be ( @xmath26 ) was deduced by the combination of tof between the target and hod ( about 4  m ) , and tracking analysis . the momentum resolutions ( 1@xmath47 ) of @xmath1be for the reaction with the pb target were 0.80% , 0.77% , and 0.32% respectively for the @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 , which represent the horizontal , vertical , and parallel momenta .",
    "those for the c target were 0.47% , 0.47% , and 0.32% , respectively .",
    "this difference in the energy resolution for the transverse directions according to the target is due to the different multiple scattering between the heavy and light targets .",
    "the relative energy resolution was determined by a monte - carlo simulation incorporating the momentum resolutions of @xmath1be and the neutron . the relative energy resolution ( fwhm )",
    "was thus estimated to be @xmath54  mev and @xmath55  mev respectively for the pb and c targets .",
    "the angular resolution of @xmath23 in 1  @xmath47 was 0.41 degrees and 0.48 degrees respectively for the pb and c targets .",

    ", events were generated as a function of @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and the corresponding acceptance functions for the pb and c targets were deduced for these observables . the net geometrical acceptance was obtained as a ratio of the breakup events of interest with and without acceptance correction .",
    "the acceptance thus estimated turned out to be 52% for the pb target with the energy - angular ranges of 0  @xmath56  5  mev and @xmath57 .",
    "the same quantity was 31% for the c target , with the ranges of 0  @xmath56  8  mev and @xmath58 .",

    "the angular ranges for the whole acceptance are different depending on the target used because the angle @xmath23 in the projectile - target center of mass frame is about twice as much as that in the laboratory frame for the c target , while they are about the same for the pb target .",
    "the spectra for the whole acceptance show conspicuously different characteristics depending on the target .",
    "a huge asymmetric peak is seen for the pb target , while two peaks , corresponding to the known states at @xmath5  =  1.78  mev and 3.41  mev , are seen on top of the decreasing continuum for the c target .",

    ", the systematic uncertainty comes mainly from that in the neutron detection efficiency , which affects solely the absolute normalization of the spectrum .",
    "a minor contribution to the uncertainty is due to the target excitation and due to the events decaying to the @xmath1be excited states , which can be significant for the carbon target data .",
    "these contributions have been estimated and subtracted using the q - value spectrum reconstructed from all the four momentum vectors of @xmath0be , @xmath1be , and the neutron .",
    "the events excluded with this procedure were about 4  % and 19  % of the total events for the pb and c targets , respectively .",
    "the substantially larger cross section for the pb target over the c target is a clear indication of the dominance of the coulomb breakup for the pb target .",
    "the current relative energy spectrum observed for the pb target is consistent with our previous experiment  @xcite .",
    "the absolute value in the current experiment is about 17% smaller in the central values .",
    "this discrepancy of the central value is within the systematic uncertainty ( of about 20% ) of the absolute value in the previous experiment .",
    "the current pb spectrum is consistent with the gsi data  @xcite if one takes into consideration the different virtual photon spectra at the two different incident energies .",
    "the two peaks observed for the current carbon target data were not observed in the gsi data at 520  mev / nucleon  @xcite .",
    "this fact may be attributed to the different contribution of the inelastic scattering to these states for different incident energies .",
    "the eikonal calculation in ref .",
    "@xcite suggests that the diffractive breakup , which contains the inelastic scattering to discrete states , is expected to have a factor of 35 larger cross section below 100  mev / nucleon than at high energies .",
    "in fact , the current cross section is about 3 times larger than the value of 32.6(1.6 ) mb reported in ref .",
    "@xcite . due to the smaller cross section at higher energies",
    ", the peaks might not have been statistically significant in the gsi experiment .",
    "the larger cross section and the better energy resolution at intermediate energies compared to higher energies may be better suited for spectroscopic studies of such discrete unbound resonance states .",
    "it should be noted that the @xmath62 removal cross section in the @xmath62 coincidence measurement with the detectors placed in the forward direction adopted in the current and in the quoted gsi experiments corresponds to the diffractive breakup cross section , while the other component of the reaction , the 1@xmath20 knockout process , is out of the acceptances .",
    "taking into account the fact that the diffractive breakup cross section is expected to be about half of the total @xmath62 removal cross section at intermediate energies  @xcite , we find that the current cross section is consistent with the value of 259(39 )  mb obtained for the @xmath0be + @xmath63be reaction with no coincidence with the neutron at a similar incident energy of 60  mev / nucleon  @xcite .",

    ", we may adopt the @xmath70  =  2.1(5 ) as an estimation of the nuclear contribution at this incident energy .",
    "the value of @xmath70  =  2.1(5 ) is smaller than that obtained at gsi at 520  mev / nucleon . according to eikonal calculation  @xcite",
    ", the energy dependence of @xmath70 can be understood by the fact that at higher energies the black - disk like picture is more vague by low nn cross sections .",
    "namely , the serber - type picture is to be modified at higher energies .",
    "( a )  the @xmath22 spectrum for the pb target ( open circles ) for the whole acceptance ( @xmath57 ) is compared with the pure 1st - order e1 coulomb breakup calculation with @xmath67  =  0.72(solid line ) .",
    "the difference between them ( histogram ) represents the non first - order coulomb breakup ( nfcb ) component .",
    "( b )  the nfcb component is compared to the c target data with the scaling factor @xmath70  =  2.1.,width=302 ]",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the coulomb and nuclear breakup of @xmath0be on pb and c targets at 69  mev / nucleon and 67  mev / nucleon , respectively . by measuring the momentum vectors of the incoming @xmath0be , of the outgoing @xmath1be , and the neutron in coincidence ,",
    "we have extracted the relative energy spectra as well as the angular distributions of the scattering of the @xmath1be  +  @xmath20 c.m .",
    "system on both targets .",
    "the obtained angular distribution of the @xmath1be  +  @xmath20 c.m on pb has been found to be well described by the first - order e1 coulomb breakup mechanism , in particular for the very forward angular regions corresponding to large impact parameters in the semi - classical point of view .",
    "the experimental relative energy spectrum selected for @xmath75  30 fm ( or @xmath76  1.3@xmath77 ) is in perfect agreement with the 1st order pure e1 coulomb calculation with the direct breakup mechanism , leading to a spectroscopic factor of the halo configuration @xmath2 of 0.72  @xmath3  0.04 .",
    "the e1 non - energy weighted sum , corresponding to the integrated @xmath4 strength has been compared to the cluster sum rule , leading to a root - mean square distance of 5.77  @xmath3  0.16  fm for the neutron in its halo state .",
    "the energy weighted cluster sum rule has been applied to the present case . the energy weighted e1 strength has been found to be 70  @xmath3  10  % of this sum rule .",
    "it is interesting to note that this value agrees with the value of @xmath67=0.72(4 ) .",
    "we have investigated experimentally the inelastic breakup scattering of @xmath0be on c target . we have observed two peaks corresponding to the @xmath5  =  1.78  mev and 3.41  mev states .",
    "the angular distributions for these states show @xmath8=2 excitation patterns , leading to their spin - parity assignments of @xmath9=(3/2,5/2)@xmath10 .",
    "the amplitude of the angular distribution has provided the deformation lengths for these states as well .",
    "the energy levels and the transition densities have been compared to shell model calculations for the low - lying positive parity states of @xmath0be in the @xmath78 model space with the wbt effective interaction .",
    "we have found that the energy levels and deformation lengths are rather well reproduced .",
    "the comparison with the shell model calculation also suggests @xmath79  =  5/2@xmath10 and @xmath79  =  3/2@xmath10 as preferred assignments for the @xmath5  =  1.78  mev and 3.41  mev states , respectively .",
    "the deformation lengths are also well reproduced with the shell model calculation with bernstein s prescription and the conventional values of effective charges .",
    "the angular distributions have been investigated further to disentangle the reaction mechanism .",
    "we have found that the @xmath8=1 coulomb component is strong at very forward angles in contrast to the @xmath8=2 pattern in the angular distribution around the 1.78 mev resonance .",
    "in fact , the relative energy spectrum for @xmath80 is well reproduced by the pure e1 direct breakup model .",
    "this result shows that coulomb breakup occurs at forward angles even on a light target such as carbon .",
    "finally , we have estimated the nuclear breakup and/or higher order effects by subtracting the calculated pure e1 coulomb component for the pb target . by making a comparison of",
    "the subtracted spectrum with the c target , the scaling factor @xmath70 of nuclear contribution for pb target to c target is estimated .",
    "the scaling factor needed to reproduce the data at @xmath74  2mev has been found to be @xmath70  =  2.1(5 ) , which is consistent with serber - type models .",
    "this value is smaller than @xmath70=5.4 extracted from data at higher energies .",
    "this incident energy dependence can be qualitatively explained in the eikonal picture .",
    "the present work demonstrates that breakup reactions , both on light and heavy targets , are powerful spectroscopic tools for low - lying states of loosely bound nuclei where the excitation above the particle emission threshold is close to the ground state .",
    "in particular , this work shows that the combination of angular distribution data with the relative energy spectra is very effective for extracting structure information by disentangling coulomb and nuclear excitations .",
    "it can be easily foreseen that the study of the inelastic scattering to states above the threshold with different targets would provide complementary information on the excitation process and on the structure of excited states in the continuum .",
    "more elaborate theoretical work on breakup reactions would be desirable to construct the spectroscopic properties in a more microscopic way for the future ri beam science .",
    "sincere gratitude is extended to the accelerator staff of riken for their excellent operation of the beam delivery .",
    "fruitful discussions with t.  motobayashi , k.  yabana , m.  ueda , m.  takashina , and k. hencken are greatly appreciated .",
