    "a large number of physically important nonlinear models are completely integrable , which means that they are linearizable via an explicit transformation or solvable via the inverse scattering transform .",
    "integrable continuous or discrete models arise in key branches of physics including classical , quantum , particle , statistical , and plasma physics .",
    "integrable equations also model wave phenomena in nonlinear optics and the bio - sciences .",
    "mathematically , nonlinear models involve ordinary or partial differential equations ( odes or pdes ) , differential - difference equations ( ddes ) , integral equations , etc . @xcite .",
    "whichever form they come in , completely integrable equations exhibit analytic properties reflecting their rich mathematical structure .",
    "for instance , completely integrable pdes and ddes possess infinitely many symmetries and conserved quantities ( if the model is conservative ) .",
    "perhaps after a suitable change of variables , the equations have the painlev property , admit bcklund transformations , prolongation structures , or can be written in bi - hamiltonian form @xcite .",
    "the existence of an infinite hierarchy of symmetries for integrable equations can be established by explicitly constructing the recursion operator that connects such symmetries .",
    "finding symmetries and recursion operators for nonlinear models is a nontrivial task , in particular if attempted with pen and paper .",
    "computer algebra systems can greatly assist in the search for higher - order symmetries and recursion operators .",
    "in this paper we present a direct algorithm that allows one to automatically compute polynomial higher - order symmetries for polynomial pdes in 1 + 1 dimension and polynomial ddes ( semi - discrete equations ) .",
    "the systems of ddes or pdes must be of evolution type , i.e. first order in ( continuous ) time . the number of equations and the order of differentiation ( or shift level ) in the spatial variable are arbitrary .",
    "we use the dilation invariance of the given system of pdes or ddes to determine the form of the polynomial generalized symmetry . upon substitution of the form of the symmetry into the defining equation",
    ", one has to solve a linear system for the unknown constant coefficients of the symmetry . in case",
    "the original system contains free parameters , the eliminant of that linear system will determine the necessary conditions for the parameters , so that the system admits the required generalized symmetry .",
    "our algorithm can thus be used as an integrability test for classes of equations involving parameters .    for the pde case ,",
    "a slight extension of our algorithm allows one to compute higher - order symmetries that _ explicitly _ depend on the independent variables @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "however , in such cases , it is necessary to specify the highest degree of the independent variables in the generalized symmetry .    once the generalized symmetries are explicitly known , it is quite often possible to find the recursion operator by inspection @xcite . if the recursion operator is _ hereditary _ then the equation will possess infinitely many symmetries .",
    "if the operator is hereditary and _ factorizable _ then the equation has infinitely many conserved quantities @xcite .    for lagrangian systems",
    "the set of higher - order symmetries can be shown to lead to the set of conservation laws @xcite . for equations without lagrangian structure",
    "there is no universal correspondence between symmetries and conservation laws . for _ mathematica _ algorithms and code to compute conservations laws of nonlinear pdes and ddes",
    "we refer to @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the relationship between symmetries and conservation laws , as expressed through noether s theorem , is beyond the scope of this paper ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we give the definition of generalized symmetry .",
    "we also give the three steps of the algorithm to compute generalized symmetries of nonlinear evolution equations .",

    "we extend the algorithm to nonlinear ddes ( the semi - discrete case ) , with the toda lattice as leading example .",

    "the result of this dimensional analysis can be stated as follows : @xmath30 corresponds to two derivatives with respect to @xmath0 , for short , @xmath31 .",
    "similarly , @xmath32 . scaling invariance , which is a special lie - point symmetry , is an intrinsic property of many integrable nonlinear pdes and ddes .",

    "these extra parameters can be viewed as additional dependent variables , however , their derivatives are zero . by extending the action of the dilation symmetry to the space of independent and dependent variables , _ including _ the parameters , we are able to apply our algorithm to a larger range of polynomial pde systems .",
