    "* game theory * has been enjoying widespread adoption by the engineering community as a distributed optimization and control framework for networked systems , partly for taking into account preferences of individual users , who share and compete for system resources .",
    "resting upon a rich mathematical foundation , game theoretical approaches , especially strategic ( noncooperative ) games , have been valuable for analysis and design of various resource allocation protocols in wireless and wired networks .",
    "problems such as rate control , interference management , and power control ( e.g. in wireless and optical networks ) have been investigated extensively by the research community using game theoretical methods @xcite .",
    "game theory models nodes of networked systems as independent and autonomous decision makers with limited global information , and studies incentives of individual players and effects of their preferences on the overall outcome .",
    "the nash equilibrium ( ne ) , where no player has an incentive to deviate from the ne while others adopt it , is known to be useful solution concept for such games .",
    "it is widely adopted for development of distributed and dynamic algorithms assuming some mild existence and uniqueness conditions @xcite .    given the broad applicability of game theoretic frameworks , it is not surprising to observe an increasing interest in * mechanism design * , which studies rules and structure of games such that their outcome achieve certain objectives  @xcite .",
    "this is especially relevant in development of distributed control schemes for networks where satisfying certain global properties such as * efficiency * are as important as the solution s compatibility with user incentives .",
    "a game designer can impose rules and incentives , e.g. in the form of prices , to players of such that the outcome of a strategic game , for example , the unique nash equilibrium solution is * preference - compatible * and at the same time maximizes a certain global objective function such as the sum of player utilities or quality - of - service ( qos ) constraints .",
    "however , this interaction between the designer and players of the game may create now a separate incentive for the players to misrepresent their utilities to the designer with the purpose of selfishly benefiting from it .",
    "therefore , the mechanism designer has a third objective called * strategy - proofness * ( or _ truth dominance _ ) , in addition to the goals of efficiency and preference - compatibility .",
    "this paper builds upon earlier work  @xcite , which has presented a decision and control theoretic approach to game design taking into account only efficiency and preference - compatibility objectives while assuming that players are honest toward the game designer in terms of their preferences . here , we present an optimization framework for mechanism design that satisfies all three objectives , adding strategy - proofness to the previous two",
    ".    the difficulty facing a mechanism designer trying to achieve all three objectives can be best appreciated with a specific example .",
    "consider maximization of the sum of player utilities as the efficiency criterion of a specific problem .",
    "assume that the designer can impose a pricing scheme on users for their actions as an enforcement method .",
    "however , individual player utilities are not directly revealed to anyone .",
    "assume in addition that the underlying strategic game admits a unique ne solution .",
    "the task of the designer is then to find such a mechanism that it moves the ne of the game to a point , which maximizes the sum of these unknown player utilities ( figure  [ fig : neopt2 ] ) , while the players try to mislead the designer by misrepresenting their actual utility functions .",
    "in addition , the designer may not _ observe _ players actions completely bringing additional restrictions to the information flow within the system .    due to the difficulty of the above described task , there are naturally many impossibility results in the mechanism design literature @xcite . in contrast",
    ", this paper adopts a more constructive engineering approach and focuses on schemes that achieve all three objectives , albeit in some cases only approximately .",
    "the algorithms presented and analyzed here are examples of market clearance schemes , where all participants have an incentive to reveal their true preferences , and leading to solutions satisfactory to both designer and players from global and local points of view , respectively .",
    "most of these mechanisms can be intuitively explained by the old adages of `` _ _ actions speak louder than words _ _ '' ( designer deducing players true preferences by observing their actions ) and `` _ _ you get what you paid for _ _ '' ( designer charging players for their actions ) .",
    "however , we also note that the presented results are obtained only in very specific settings with various assumptions on player preferences ( smooth and convex utility functions ) , on the underlying game ( existence and uniqueness of the ne ) , and on a certain degree of observability of player actions by the designer .",
    "while these restrictions may decrease applicability of the results to certain areas of economics , the presented optimization framework is of value in engineering settings , especially for the purpose of analyzing and developing distributed optimization and control schemes for networks .",
    "the main contributions of this paper include :    * development of an unifying optimization framework for mechanism design , which encompasses both auction - based and pricing mechanisms . * extension of earlier results on game design  @xcite to mechanism design by taking into account the strategy - proofness criterion . *",
    "application of the mechanism design framework to resource allocation problems in networks such as rate control and interference management ( power control ) .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next section presents the underlying model and assumptions of the unified framework developed .",
    "section  [ sec : auction ] studies auction - based mechanisms .",
    "subsequently , section  [ sec : pricing ] investigates pricing mechanisms .",
    "section  [ sec : background ] provides an overview of relevant literature on mechanism design .",
    "the paper concludes with remarks of section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "this section discusses the underlying model and assumptions of the unified framework for mechanism design .      at the center of the game and mechanism design model",
    "is the _ designer _",
    "@xmath0 who influences @xmath1 _ players _ , denoted by the set @xmath2 , and participating in a * strategic ( noncooperative ) game*. these players are autonomous and independent decision makers , who share and compete for limited resources under the given constraints of the environment . concurrently , the designer tries to ensure that the outcome of the game satisfies the desirable properties of efficiency , preference - compatibility , and strategy - proofness .",
    "this setup is applicable to a variety of problems in networking ( wireless spectrum and bandwidth management ) and economics ( auctions ) .",
    "let us define an @xmath1-player strategic game , @xmath3 , where each player @xmath4 has a respective * decision variable * @xmath5 such that @xmath6 \\in { \\mathcal}x \\subset { \\mathbb r}^n,\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the decision space of all players .",
    "as a starting point , this paper assumes scalar decision variables and a compact and convex decision space .",
    "the decision variables may represent , depending on the specific problem formulation , player flow rate , power level , investment , or bidding in an auction . due to the inherent coupling between the players , the decisions of players directly affect each other s performance as well as the aggregate allocation of limited resources .",
    "the * preferences * of the players are captured by utility functions @xmath8 which are chosen to be continuous and differentiable for analytical tractability . in many cases ,",
    "the utility functions have special properties such as concavity or monotonicity due to the underlying problem formulation , or these can be assumed to simplify the analysis .",
    "the designer @xmath0 devises a * mechanism * @xmath9 , which can be represented by the mapping @xmath10 , implemented by introducing incentives in the form of _ rules and prices _ to players .",
    "the latter can be formulated by adding it as a cost term such that the player @xmath11 has the cost function @xmath12 thus , the * player objective * is to solve the following individual optimization problem in the strategic game @xmath13 under the given constraints of the strategic game , and rules and prices imposed by the designer .",
    "specific properties and variants of these rules and prices will be discussed in the subsequent sections .",
    "the * nash equilibrium * ( ne ) is a widely - accepted and useful solution concept in strategic games , where no player has an incentive to deviate from it while others play according to their ne strategies .",
    "it plays an important role here since if it is unique , then the ne outcome automatically satisfies the * preference - compatibility * criterion , which basically states that the mechanism outcome must coincide with the solution of the players individual optimization problems ( [ e : useropt ] ) .",
    "the ne @xmath14 of the game @xmath3 is formally defined as @xmath15 where @xmath16 $ ] .",
    "the ne is at the same time the intersection point of players best responses obtained by solving ( [ e : useropt ] ) individually .",
    "if some special convexity and compactness conditions are imposed to the game @xmath3 , then it admits a unique ne solution , which simplifies mechanism and algorithm design significantly . for a detailed discussion on these conditions and properties of ne",
    ", we refer to @xcite .",
    "similar to player preferences , the * designer objective * , e.g. maximization of aggregate user utilities or social welfare , can be formulated using a smooth objective function @xmath17 for the designer : @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 , @xmath21 are user - specific pricing terms and player utilities , respectively .",
    "hence , the global optimization problem of the designer is simply @xmath22 , which it solves _ indirectly _ by setting rules and prices . in some cases",
    ", the objective function @xmath17 characterizes the desirability of an outcome @xmath23 from the designers perspective .",
    "in other cases when the designer objective is to satisfy certain minimum performance constraints such as players achieving certain quality - of - service levels , the objective can be characterized by a region ( a subset of the game domain @xmath24 ) .",
    "thus , the designer objective represents and corresponds to the * efficiency * criterion of the mechanism .",
    "it is important to note that the designer can only influence the outcome of the game indirectly and can not dictate actions of players ( which would have immediately negated preference - compatibility ) .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that a function linear in @xmath5 , such as @xmath25 , is sufficient for the designer to ( indirectly ) manipulate the unique ne outcome in the ideal full information case where the players are honest and open about their preferences .",
    "figure  [ fig : neopt2 ] visualizes this process .",
    "the third and an important criterion of mechanism design is * strategy - proofness * , which is also referred to as _ incentive - compatibility _ or _",
    "truth dominance_. if a mechanism does not possess this property , then the players have an incentive to misrepresent their utilities to the designer and `` _ _ cheat _ _ '' in order to possibly obtain a larger share of the resources . within the context of the presented model",
    ", this criterion can be formally expressed as : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the misrepresented utility , @xmath14 is the original ne solution , and @xmath28 is the distorted ne under @xmath27 . the interaction between the players of the underlying strategic game , @xmath2 , and the mechanism designer , @xmath0 is depicted in figure  [ fig : mechdesign1 ] .",
    "taking into account the breadth of the field mechanism design , it is useful to clarify the underlying assumptions of the model studied in this paper .",
    "the * environment * where the players and designer interact is characterized by the following properties :    * the available resources , which the players share and compete for , are limited .",
    "* the environment imposes restrictions on available information to players and communication between them .",
    "hence , it imposes a certain information structure to distributed mechanisms and sometimes makes it difficult to deploy centralized ones .",
    "* the designer may not fully observe the player actions and has often limited information about their preferences .",
    "the players share and compete for limited resources in the given environment under its information and communication constraints .",
    "three basic types of resource sharing and coupling are often encountered in a variety of problems in networking :    1 .   _",
    "additive resource sharing : _ the players share a finite resource @xmath29 such that @xmath30 this type of coupling is encountered in bandwidth sharing and rate control in networks",
    "interference coupling _",
    "( linear interference ) : the resource allocated to player @xmath11 , @xmath31 , is inversely proportional to interference generated others such that @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 denote some system parameters .",
    "interference coupling occurs in wireless networks where @xmath35 represents signal - to - interference ratio .",
    "multiplicative coupling : _ the resource @xmath36 of player @xmath11 is affected multiplicatively by the decisions of others such that @xmath37 this type of coupling is seen in random multiple access schemes , e.g. slotted aloha scheme in wireless networks @xcite .",
    "it is possible to extend these definitions , for example , by making the finite resource @xmath29 time varying or changing the interference function .",
    "couple of axiomatic frameworks for the second case exist in the literature @xcite .",
    "the examples in this paper are of types 1 and 2 .",
    "the following assumptions are made on the designer and players :    * the designer is honest , i.e. does not try to deceive the players . *",
    "each player acts independently and rationally according to its own self interests . *",
    "the players may try to deceive the designer by hiding or misrepresenting their individual preferences . *",
    "both players and designer follow the rules of the mechanism .    within the scope of the model discussed in the previous subsection ,",
    "specific formulations of the three criteria of mechanism design are summarized as :    .three criteria of mechanism design [ tbl : mechdesign ] [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in auction - based mechanisms , the designer uses an allocation rule in addition to pricing .",
    "hence , the designer _ explicitly allocates _ the players their share of resources based on their bids .",
    "the players decide on their bids or actions by minimizing their cost which is a combination of their own utilities and prices imposed by the designer .",
    "specifically , the designer @xmath0 imposes on a player @xmath4 a user - specific    * resource allocation rule , @xmath38 , * resource pricing , @xmath39 ,    where @xmath23 denotes the vector of player actions or bids .",
    "the specific properties of these functions will be discussed later as part of individual mechanisms .    as presented in section  [ sec : model ] , each player @xmath11 aims to minimize its own cost @xmath40 , as in ( [ e : usercost ] ) , while the designer tries to achieve the objectives summarized in table  [ tbl : mechdesign ] . in some cases ,",
    "the designer may only observe the bids imperfectly as a function of the actual bids , @xmath41 .",
    "however , in this paper , we assume that all bids are perfectly observable and @xmath42 for simplicity .",
    "figure  [ fig : auctionmech1 ] visually depicts the auction - based mechanisms described .     imposes a resource allocation rule as well as pricing on players @xmath2 of the underlying strategic game ,",
    "whose bids @xmath23 may be observed imperfectly as @xmath43 , with the purpose of satisfying a global objective @xmath17 . ]",
    "consider , as a starting point , an additive resource sharing scenario where the players bid for a fixed divisible resource @xmath29 and are allocated their share captured by the vector @xmath44 $ ] such that at full utilization @xmath45 .",
    "the @xmath46 player s individual cost function @xmath47 in terms of player bids @xmath23 is defined as @xmath48 the pricing term has the general form of @xmath49 where @xmath50 denotes the unit price . in accordance with the earlier results  @xcite and due to the nature of the auction - based mechanism ,",
    "it is sufficient for the purposes of the designer to choose a pricing function linear in @xmath51 , i.e. @xmath52 . the player utility function @xmath53 is separable , i.e. it depends only on the individual allocation of the player .",
    "it is also assumed to be continuous , strictly concave , and twice differentiable in terms of its argument @xmath51 .",
    "thus , the cost function of player @xmath11 can be written as @xmath54 which is strictly convex with respect to @xmath51 under the assumptions made . from a player s perspective , who tries to minimize its cost in terms of the actual resources obtained ,",
    "the condition @xmath55 is necessary and sufficient for optimality . thus suppressing the dependence of user cost on bids @xmath23 , in order for the auction - based mechanism to be * preference - compatible * , it has to satisfy @xmath56 furthermore , if additional assumptions are made on @xmath47 , it can be shown that the game admits a unique ne , @xmath57 ( or @xmath14 ) @xcite .    different from players , the designer @xmath0 has two objectives : maximizing the sum of utilities of players and allocating all of the existing resource @xmath29 , i.e. its full utilization .",
    "hence , the designer @xmath0 solves the constrained optimization problem @xmath58 in order to find a globally optimal allocation @xmath59 that satisfies this * efficiency criterion*. the associated lagrangian function is then @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a scalar lagrange multiplier . under the convexity assumptions made ,",
    "this leads to @xmath62 and the efficiency constraint @xmath63    it is important to note that sum of utility maximization as designer objective , i.e. @xmath64 is * only one * possible global objective among many others such as ensuring a certain qos to players ( see @xcite for a more detailed discussion ) .",
    "the interaction between the designer and players ( see figure  [ fig : mechdesign1 ] ) is through a _ bidding / allocation process _ in auction - based mechanisms . since the players can not obtain the resource @xmath59 directly",
    ", they make a bid for their own total cost , which is denoted by the vector @xmath23",
    ". the pricing @xmath65 and allocation @xmath66 rules of the auction - based mechanism should satisfy the efficiency and preference - compatibility criteria discussed above .",
    "a player s bid ( or action ) , @xmath5 , is an indicator of the player s willingness to pay and plays a crucial role in devising a mechanism that is * strategy - proof*. formally , a mechanism is strategy - proof , if no player has an incentive to deviate from its truthful bid @xmath67 where @xmath68 is a scalar and @xmath14 is the outcome ( ne ) of the underlying strategic game .      in the specific resource sharing setting defined , an auction - based mechanism , @xmath69 , can be defined based on the bid of player @xmath11 , @xmath70 the pricing function @xmath71 for a scalar @xmath72 sufficiently large such that @xmath73 , and the resource allocation rule @xmath74 it is also possible to interpret the scaler @xmath75 as a _ reserve bid _ @xcite .",
    "the next theorem establishes that this mechanism is preference - compatible , strategy - proof , and asymptotically efficient .",
    "[ thm : auction1 ] the auction - based mechanism @xmath69 defined by ( [ e : bid1 ] ) , ( [ e : price1 ] ) , and ( [ e : q1 ] ) allocates the fixed divisible resource @xmath29 to a set of selfish rational players @xmath2 with respective cost functions ( [ e : playercost1 ] ) in such a way that the mechanism is preference - compatible , strategy - proof , and asymptotically efficient , if @xmath76 where @xmath14 denotes the truthful bid of player @xmath11 at the ne outcome .",
    "in other words , the outcome of the mechanism ensures that    * optimal allocation obtained , @xmath57 , satisfies + @xmath77 , * no player has an incentive to deviate from its truthful bid , @xmath78 * @xmath57 solves the constrained optimization problem in ( [ e : designerobj1 ] ) asymptotically , i.e. as @xmath79 .    the mechanism @xmath69 is defined by the bidding process ( [ e : bid1 ] ) , unit prices ( [ e : price1 ] ) , and allocation rule ( [ e : q1 ] ) for each player @xmath4 .",
    "substituting these into the player cost function ( [ e : playercost1 ] ) results in @xmath80 due to the convexity of @xmath81 in @xmath5 , the first order necessary condition for optimality is also sufficient : @xmath82 from definition of @xmath50 in ( [ e : price1 ] ) follows @xmath83 for each player @xmath11 .",
    "hence , the mechanism @xmath69 is _ preference - compatible_. furthermore , it is straightforward to show that this game admits a unique ne , @xmath14 @xcite",
    ".    assume a player @xmath11 deviates from its truthful bid @xmath5 by an amount @xmath68 such that @xmath84 .",
    "then , the player cost under @xmath69 becomes @xmath85 in order @xmath69 to be _ strategy - proof _",
    ", @xmath86 which immediately holds under the assumption in the theorem .",
    "although it is preference - compatible and strategy - proof , the mechanism @xmath69 is not fully efficient as it does not exactly solve the designer optimization problem ( [ e : designerobj1 ] ) . to see this ,",
    "let us solve ( [ e : global1 ] ) and ( [ e : constraint1 ] ) using @xmath87 to obtain @xmath88 these optimal solutions ( with respect to designer objective ) are only approximated by the pricing ( [ e : price1 ] ) and allocation ( [ e : q1 ] ) rules .",
    "hence , @xmath89 and @xmath90 the choice of suboptimal ( in the sense of efficiency ) rules is due to the fact that @xmath69 has to achieve strategy - proofness at the same time as efficiency and preference - compatibility .",
    "however , as the number of players increases , @xmath91 , and by choosing @xmath75 accordingly small , the approximation becomes more precise .",
    "thus , the mechanism @xmath69 is _ asymptotically efficient_.      as a special case of the auction - based mechanism @xmath69 , consider a setup where , the player utility functions are logarithmic and respectively weighted by a positive scalar parameter @xmath92 such that @xmath93 then , the following result holds as a special case of theorem  [ thm : auction1 ] .",
    "[ thm : auction2 ] the auction - based mechanism @xmath69 defined by ( [ e : bid1 ] ) , ( [ e : price1 ] ) , and ( [ e : q1 ] ) allocates the fixed divisible resource @xmath29 to a set of selfish rational players @xmath2 with respective cost functions ( [ e : playercost1 ] ) and utilities @xmath94 in such a way that the mechanism is preference - compatible , strategy - proof , and asymptotically efficient .",
    "the proofs of preference - compatibility and asymptotic efficiency follow directly from the ones of theorem  [ thm : auction1 ] . furthermore , the mechanism is strategy - proof under logarithmic player utilities since they satisfy the sufficient condition in theorem  [ thm : auction1 ] .",
    "the condition in this case is @xmath95 leading to @xmath96 the player s truthful bid is @xmath97 from its cost function ( [ e : playercost1 ] ) .",
    "thus , we obtain @xmath98 which holds by definition , and completes the proof .      in many problem formulations ,",
    "the player utilities are non - separable , i.e. they depend also on other player s actions .",
    "this is the case , for example , in interference coupled systems such as a cellular wireless system with a base station ( acting as the designer ) and mobile devices or users as players who bid to achieve a certain qos level .",
    "let @xmath5 denote the bid of a mobile device and the @xmath99 the transmission power assigned to it by the base station .",
    "then , the signal - to - interference ratio ( sir ) of the received signal by the mobile is @xmath100 where @xmath101 is an independent noise term .",
    "notice that this is essentially a centralized scheme similar to the ones currently deployed .",
    "a decentralized version will be discussed in section  [ sec : pricing ] .",
    "this interference management and power control formulation has been discussed extensively in the literature , e.g. @xcite .",
    "however , such mechanisms do not necessarily need to be limited to wireless networks and apply to any system with linear interference coupling  @xcite under the assumption that the player utilities are @xmath102 continuous , strictly concave , and twice differentiable in their arguments @xmath31 ( [ e : sir ] ) .",
    "consider an auction - based mechanism for an interference - coupled system where players have non - separable and logarithmic utilities and a linear pricing scheme , which make the problem more tractable .",
    "then , each player @xmath11 minimizes its respective cost @xmath103 which is strictly convex in player power level @xmath104 .",
    "consequently , the general condition for player preference - compatibility is @xmath105 , as in examples 1 and 2 .",
    "the global objective of the designer is to maximize sum of utilities of players while trying to limit the total interference effect to an upper - bound @xmath29 .",
    "this approximate formulation is motivated by , for example , limiting the aggregate inter - cell interference created by the mobile devices in a wireless network , where base stations have no means of communication among themselves .",

    "then , the designer deploys this iterative mechanism to compute the optimal prices @xmath132 as a solution to ( [ e : m2 ] ) .    for example , consider the following iterative pricing mechanism @xmath133 where @xmath134 is a small step size , @xmath61 , and @xmath135 where @xmath136 .",
    "here , @xmath137 denotes the time ( update ) step .",
    "note that , the players adopt a relaxed or gradient update scheme instead of best response taking into account variability of the system .",
    "the gradient update also helps with convergence .      as a special case ,",
    "let the utility function of players be logarithmic and weighted by parameter @xmath92 such that @xmath138 for player @xmath11 .",
    "such utility functions have been utilized in the literature , for example , to model user demand in rate or congestion control on networks .",
    "the solution aligning the player and designer objectives , in other words the efficient nash equilibrium , has the following properties : @xmath139 @xmath140 hence , the resulting optimal pricing mechanism for all players is @xmath141    although this solution is preference - compatible from the players perspective and solves the global optimization problem of the designer , it is not strategy proof if the designer explicitly asks the players for their utility parameter @xmath92 . to see this , assume that player @xmath11 has a true utility parameter @xmath142 but misrepresents it to the designer as @xmath143 for some @xmath68 .",
    "then , the new price is @xmath144 and player @xmath11 real cost becomes @xmath145 instead of @xmath146 substituting @xmath147 and computing @xmath119 yields @xmath148 and similarly we have @xmath149 clearly , the player @xmath11 can decrease its cost ( @xmath150 ) by choosing a @xmath151 despite being charged the same total price .",
    "thus , the mechanism is not strategy - proof .",
    "this issue is remedied by adopting the proposed iterative pricing mechanism : @xmath152 @xmath153 the unique ( nash ) equilibrium solution of this iterative algorithm , @xmath154 solves the designer problem ( [ e : designerobj1 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , since the players adopt here a relaxed ( gradient ) best response at each step and there is no explicit communication between the players and the designer , the scheme is strategy - proof . to see this , assume otherwise and let player @xmath11 `` misrepresent '' its actions @xmath84 for some @xmath68 .",
    "then , the player s instantaneous cost is @xmath155 at each step of the iteration .",
    "hence , the players have no incentive to `` cheat ''",
    ".    the communication requirements of the algorithm ( [ e : iterative2a])-([e : iterative2b ] ) are minimal and suitable for a distributed implementation in a networking environment .",
    "the designer only needs to observe the total amount @xmath156 and communicate the common price @xmath124 back to the players ( see figure  [ fig : pricingmech1 ] for a visualization ) .",
    "now , a basic stability analysis is provided for the following continuous - time approximation of the iterative pricing mechanism @xmath157 @xmath158 where @xmath159 denotes time and @xmath160 is a user - specific step size . as in the discrete - time version ,",
    "the players adopt here a gradient best response algorithm .",

    "it is straightforward to show through algebraic manipulations that @xmath163 for all @xmath164 .",
    "hence , the continuous - time algorithm is globally asymptotically stable @xcite .",
    "this result is a strong indicator of convergence @xcite of the discrete - time iterative pricing mechanism ( [ e : iterative2a])-([e : iterative2b ] ) .      in some problem formulations , such as interference coupled systems consisting of a base station ( acting as the designer ) and mobile devices as players ,",
    "the players actions are beyond the control of the base station .",
    "let , specifically , @xmath165 denote the received power level as a product of uplink transmission power @xmath166 and channel loss @xmath167 of player @xmath11 .",
    "if linear interference is assumed , then the signal - to - interference ratio ( sir ) of the received signal is @xmath168 as in ( [ e : sir ] ) .    in pricing mechanism ,",
    "similar to the auction in section  [ sec : auctionnonsep ] , each player @xmath11 minimizes its respective cost @xmath169 which is strictly convex in @xmath5 .",
    "consequently , the general condition for player preference - compatibility is @xmath170 .",
    "the global objective of the designer aims to maximize sum of utilities of players while trying to limit the total interference effect to @xmath29 , motivated by e.g. limiting the aggregate interference created by the mobile devices in a wireless network .",
    "hence , the designer @xmath0 solves @xmath171 this problem differs from the one in section  [ sec : auctionnonsep ] as it is non - convex .",
    "however , it can be convexified using the nonlinear transform @xmath172 , and then admits a unique solution @xcite .",
    "the resulting necessary and sufficient conditions for optimality are @xmath173 where @xmath174 is the interference affecting player @xmath11 .",

    ", the mechanism is preference - compatible and efficient .",
    "since the players have no incentive to deviate from their ( gradient ) best responses , it is also inherently strategy - proof as discussed in example 4 .",
