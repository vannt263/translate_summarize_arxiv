    "spinons are elementary excitations characteristic of strongly correlated electron systems in low dimensions  @xcite , observable by angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy  @xcite and neutron scattering  @xcite .",
    "there is a manifestation of electron fractionalization called spin - charge separation , which , instead of forming a single quasiparticle , the electronic excitation splits into spin ( spinon ) and charge ( holon ) degrees of freedom . in frustrated spin systems with exotic ground states such as spin - liquid and valence - bond - solid states ,",
    "the spinon is associated with a topological excitation similar to the magnetic domain wall  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the collective excitation in a magnetic long - ranged ordered state , i.e. , magnon , the spinon carries a fractional quantum number , spin @xmath2 , accompanied by a spin string .",
    "because of this topological nature , two spinons make in some instances a bound state called a triplon  @xcite .    the frustrated two - leg spin - ladder system , i.e. , the @xmath3-@xmath4-@xmath5 model ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tlzz ] ) , provides those exotic magnetic states , because this model bridges two different systems : the frustrated spin chain , i.e. , @xmath3-@xmath4 model , and the non - frustrated spin ladder , i.e. , @xmath3-@xmath5 model . here , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the nearest and the next - nearest antiferromagnetic exchange interactions , respectively , and @xmath5 is the antiferromagnetic interaction in the rung direction . the ground - state phase diagram has been examined numerically  @xcite , and has two phases : the columnar - dimer ( cd ) phase , which continuously merges to the dimer phase of the frustrated chain system ( @xmath3-@xmath4 model ) in the zero limit of @xmath5 , and the rung - singlet ( rs ) phase , which continuously changes to the ground state of the non - frustrated ladder system ( @xmath3-@xmath5 model ) in the zero limit of @xmath4 .",
    "note that the phase transition between the rs and the cd phases is of ising type  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the excited states of the @xmath3-@xmath4-@xmath5 model will be non - trivial as frustration leads to the confinement of spinons and triplons  @xcite .",
    "the two limiting cases of the @xmath3-@xmath4 and @xmath3-@xmath5 models are contained in the @xmath3-@xmath4-@xmath5 model .",
    "therefore , this frustrated two - leg spin ladder is useful for understanding the effects of frustration on magnetic excitations .",
    "several properties of the two limiting cases are summarized below .",
    "the @xmath3-@xmath4 model has two ground states : gapless spin - liquid and gapped dimer phases . between these phases ,",
    "a kosterlitz - thouless transition occurs if the ratio of the exchange interactions , @xmath6 , changes  @xcite . in the spin - liquid phase ,",
    "the spin correlation function exhibits a critical behavior and has no long - range order .",
    "the excitations are well understood within the spinon picture , which is obtained by the jordan - wigner transformation of the spin operators .",
    "in particular , the triplet excitation is dominated by two - spinon excitation  @xcite . in the dimer phase ,",
    "the two neighboring spins constitute a singlet dimer , whose dimer correlation remains finite in the limit of infinite distance  @xcite .",
    "the ground state is doubly degenerated owing to the two choices in forming a singlet dimer with either a right or a left neighboring site .",
    "the intensive studies on the non - frustrated ladder system , i.e. , the @xmath3-@xmath5 model , show that the one - dimensional spin - liquid phase is fragile with respect to the inter - chain interaction  @xcite .",
    "the rs phase appears in the ground state  @xcite , where two spins connecting a rung bond constitute a singlet dimer and there is no degeneracy .",
    "thus , the rs phase is another gapped phase different from the dimer phase .",
    "the magnetic excitation is dominated by the triplon , which is a bosonic quasiparticle defined as the triplet excitations from the rs dimers  @xcite .",
    "it is also interpreted as a bound state of two spinons  @xcite .",
    "the triplon always appears as an anti - bonding mode in the rung direction because of the parity changes between the ground state and the triplon excited state  @xcite .",
    "an excitation with an even number of triplons appears as a bonding mode in the rung direction .",
    "the bound states of two triplons are important for low - energy excitation in the bonding modes , because the intensity is much larger than the two - triplon continuum  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the magnetic excitations in the @xmath3-@xmath4-@xmath5 model . our main purpose is to clarify the effects of frustration by @xmath4 on the excitation spectra , which are observed by inelastic neutron scattering for bicu@xmath7po@xmath8 ( refs .",
    "18 - 21 ) .",
    "the compound should be compared with the unfrustrated two - leg spin - ladder compound , srcu@xmath7o@xmath9 ( ref .",
    "22 ) . not only the dispersion relation but also the spectral weight is crucial for analyzing experimental data .",
    "thus , we calculate the dynamical spin correlation function ( dscf ) by the dynamical density - matrix renormalization - group ( dynamical dmrg ) method . furthermore , we propose how to determine the ground - state phase and how to estimate the interaction @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 in bicu@xmath7po@xmath8 , by combining the dscf and inelastic neutron scattering data .",
    "our supplementary purpose is to clarify the difference between the two phases , i.e. , cd and rs phases , by the dscf and to obtain the relationship between the exchange energies and the spectrum .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we present the model hamiltonian of the frustrated two - leg spin - ladder system and method to calculate dscf by dynamical dmrg in sec .",
    "[ sec : mam ] .",
    "we also establish notation for our perturbation theory treatment to explain excitation behaviors . in sec .  [",
    "sec : res ] , we present the numerical results and some interpretations of magnetic excitations . we discuss the excitations from the perspective of frustration .",
    "ways to estimate the magnitude of the exchange interactions are also discussed .",

    "component is equal to the @xmath19 component as the model hamiltonian ( [ eq : h ] ) displays no anisotropy . to obtain the excitation spectra , we set the infinitesimal value @xmath25 to @xmath26 , which is sufficient to examine the qualitative behaviors of the spin excitations in this system",

    "@xmath29 is the rung number of the system ; specifically , the total number of spin sites is then @xmath30 .",
    "we used the dynamical dmrg method  @xcite to obtain the dscf .",

    "the last target state , the so - called correction vector , is obtained using a modified conjugate gradient method in the dynamical dmrg algorithm .",
    "we checked the convergence of the ground - state energy for the dmrg truncation number @xmath33 .",
    "we confirmed that the ground - state energy per site converges within a numerical error of less than @xmath34 for @xmath35 and used this value to obtain magnetic excitation spectra in a 32-rung frustrated ladder system .",
    "a perturbation analysis based within the resonated valence bond ( rvb ) picture was also used to obtain the ground state and low - energy excited states .",
    "we can rewrite the perturbed hamiltonian @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) using projection operators onto rvb configurations .",
    "the rvb picture helps us to handle complicated spin - configurations more easily ( see the appendix ) .",
    "we fix our notation for the singlet pair @xmath38_p$ ] and the triplet with @xmath39 , @xmath40 of two spins on the @xmath18 and @xmath41 sites ( @xmath42 ) as follows : @xmath43_{p=\\mathrm{i , u , l}}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|\\uparrow\\rangle_{j , a_p}|\\downarrow\\rangle_{k , b_p}-|\\downarrow\\rangle_{j , a_p}|\\uparrow\\rangle_{k , b_p } ) , \\\\",

    "figure [ fig : dscf ] shows the dscf in a 32-rung frustrated ladder for three phases : the incommensurate cd phase ( @xmath62 ) , the incommensurate rs phase ( @xmath63 ) , and the commensurate rs phase ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "first , we can find an obvious difference between the cd phase and the rs phase in the dscf .",
    "that is , the spectrum of the bonding mode in the cd phase [ fig .",
    "[ fig : dscf](a ) ] exhibits almost the same shape with the same intensity as that of the anti - bonding mode [ fig .",
    "[ fig : dscf](b ) ] , whereas these are completely different in the rs phase [ figs .",
    "[ fig : dscf](c)-[fig : dscf](f ) ] .",
    "the difference between the cd phase and the rs phase is understood as the difference of the elementary excitations in both phases . in the cd phase ,",
    "the key elementary excitation is the spinon , which strongly reflects one dimensionality .",
    "thus , there are few differences between the bonding and anti - bonding modes in the cd phase . by contrast , the major elementary excitation in the rs phase is the triplon , associated with excitations from the singlet to triplet state in rung bonds .",
    "the parity of the triplet state is different from that of the singlet state .",
    "therefore , the excitation exchanging the rung parity , that is , the anti - bonding mode ( @xmath65 ) , is dominant in the rs phase . with finite @xmath3",
    ", the ground state is mixed with singlet states in subspaces of even - number triplets , which has the same parity as the even - number triplet excitations .",
    "hence , the excitation of the bonding mode ( @xmath66 ) appears with finite @xmath3 .",
    "we stress that the difference in the spectral weights plays a key role in identifying the ground - state phase using inelastic neutron scattering data for the frustrated two - leg spin - ladder compound , bicu@xmath7po@xmath8 .",
    "the phase transition between the cd and rs phases in the frustrated ladder system belongs to the same universality class as the ising transition  @xcite .",
    "the crucial point of the transition is a change of the ground - state degeneracy and the symmetry .",
    "although the ground state has no degeneracy in the rs phase , there are twofold - degenerate ground states in the cd phase . at zero temperature",
    ", the translation symmetry is spontaneously broken in the cd phase .",
    "the cd phase continuously changes to the dimer phase in the @xmath3-@xmath4 model in the zero - coupling limit in the rung direction .",
    "therefore , the key excitation should be a spinon and is almost identical to the elementary excitation in the frustrated chain system .    in figs .",
    "[ fig : dscf](a ) and [ fig : dscf](b ) , we can see the lower edge of the two - spinon continuum , which corresponds to the des cloizeaux - pearson mode in the non - frustrated limit @xmath67 in the chain system  @xcite .",
    "the excitation has a minimum energy at an incommensurate wavenumber @xmath68 near the classical solution @xmath69 .",
    "the dispersion relation is almost symmetric with respect to @xmath70 , although the intensity is weaker for @xmath71 than @xmath72 .",
    "this feature originates from the doubled unit cell because of the dimerization . to explain this briefly",
    ", we consider the one - dimensional version of the dscf for the frustrated chain system at the majumdar - ghosh point @xmath73 with the periodic boundary condition .",
    "the ground states , latexmath:[\\ ] ]    these imply that the bound state , i.e. , a nearest - neighbor leg - triplet state , is no longer stable for any perturbation . with only nearest - neighbor leg interaction @xmath135 , off - diagonal parts of the perturbed hamiltonian for the momentum distribution of leg - triplet state cancel at @xmath96 .",
    "this is the reason why the bound triplon is stable around @xmath96 .",
    "the next - nearest - neighbor leg interaction @xmath136 mixes the nearest - neighbor leg - triplet state with longer - range leg - triplet states .",
    "thus , the bound triplon is smeared out under large frustration .    00 for a review , see s. maekawa , t. tohyama , s. e. barnes , s. ishihara , w. koshibae , and g. khaliullin , _ physics of transition metal oxides _ , springer series in solid - state sciences vol .  144 ( springer , berlin , 2004 ) .",
