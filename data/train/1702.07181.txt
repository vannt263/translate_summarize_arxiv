    "the heavy - quark mass provides a natural hard scale , so the processes involving heavy quarks are perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) calculable by applying proper factorization theories . among them , the nonrelativistic quantum chromodynamics ( nrqcd )  @xcite provides a powerful approach to study the properties of doubly heavy hadrons , since their heavy constituent quarks move nonrelativistically in the bound system @xcite .",
    "recently , we have studied the photoproduction of @xmath27 meson at the large hadron electron collider ( lhec )  @xcite within the framework of nrqcd , and it was found that sizable amounts of @xmath27 meson events can be generated @xcite . as a step forward , we shall investigate whether sizable amounts of doubly heavy baryon events can also be produced at the lhec .",
    "if so , to compare with future possible data , it could be inversely treated as a platform for testing the effectiveness of nrqcd .    for doubly heavy baryons @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , only @xmath0 was observed in the fixed target experiment by the selex collaboration  @xcite , which however has not been confirmed by other experiments so far . here and henceforth ,",
    "for simplicity , we use @xmath3 to denote the doubly heavy baryon @xmath28 , where @xmath29 stands for a light quark @xmath30 , @xmath31 or @xmath32 , respectively . at present , most of the predictions on the production rate and decay width are well underestimated compared to the selex measurements @xcite . thus , to understand the properties of doubly heavy baryon better , experimentally , we need to accumulate more events to reduce the statistical error ; and theoretically , it is important to make a systematic research on various production mechanism of doubly heavy baryon at different experimental platforms .",
    "a dedicate generator genxicc @xcite was developed and has been applied to study the production of doubly heavy baryon at the hadronic colliders @xcite . in 2013 ,",
    "the lhcb collaboration at the lhc performed their first search of @xmath0 , but no significant signal has been found  @xcite .",
    "future searches at the lhc with improved trigger conditions and larger data samples should improve the sensitivity significantly .",
    "in addition , series predictions on the production of doubly heavy baryon at the high luminosity electron - electron colliders , such as the @xmath33-factory @xcite and the international linear collider ( ilc )  @xcite , have also been performed .",
    "sizable amounts of doubly heavy baryon events are expected to be generated in those platforms @xcite .    in addition",
    ", the hadron - lepton collider may also be a possible machine to probe the properties of the doubly heavy baryons . as clarified in refs.@xcite",
    ", the photoproduction mechanism dominates the production of @xmath34-quark at the lhec , and the doubly heavy baryon can thus be mainly generated via the photoproduction channels @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "schematic diagrams for the photoproduction of @xmath3 at the lhec are shown in fig .",
    "the photoproduction of @xmath3 can be divided into three steps .",
    "taking @xmath37 channel as an example , the first step is the production of @xmath38 and @xmath39 pairs , where the heavy quarks @xmath6 and @xmath7 are required to be in the color- and spin - configuration @xmath12 $ ] ; the second step is the @xmath40 $ ] pair fuses into a binding diquark @xmath41 $ ] with certain probability ; the third step is the evolution of the diquark into a doubly heavy baryon @xmath3 by grabbing a light quark from the  vacuo \" or emitting / grabbing a suitable number of gluons .",
    "the first step is perturbatively calculable since the gluon should be hard enough to generate the heavy quark - antiquark pair . for the second step",
    ", the transition probability can be described by a non - perturbative nrqcd matrix element .",
    "we use @xmath42 and @xmath43 to stand for the matrix elements of the production of a color - sextuplet ( @xmath44 ) and a color - antitriplet ( @xmath45 ) diquark , respectively . and",
    "@xmath17 states , since the spin - splitting effect is small @xcite .",
    "] for the third step , one usually assumes the efficiency of evolution from a @xmath41 $ ] diquark to a doubly heavy baryon @xmath3 is @xmath46 , referring as the  direct evolution \" .",
    "ref.@xcite has studied the evolution through  direct evolution \" as well as ",
    "evolution via fragmentation \" in which the fragmentation function has been taken into account .",
    "the authors there have found that the  direct evolution \" is of high precision and is sufficient enough for studying the production of doubly heavy baryon , and thus we adopt the  direct evolution \" in our calculation .     at the lhec .",
    "the box stands for the hard interaction kernel of @xmath38 ( @xmath39)-pair production .",
    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]    since the predicted production rate of @xmath0 are much smaller than the selex measurements , the authors of refs.@xcite suggested to take into account the extrinsic and intrinsic charm production mechanism such that to shrink the gaps between theoretical and experimental predictions .",
    "it is noted that the intrinsic charm s contribution to the cross section of @xmath47 channel is less than @xmath48 even if the density of intrinsic @xmath8-component in proton is up to @xmath49 @xcite . according to our experience on the @xmath27 meson photoproduction and following the suggestion given in refs.@xcite ,",
    "we shall concentrate our attention on the channels @xmath50 and @xmath36 , in which the intermediate diquark @xmath10 $ ] is @xmath51_{\\textbf{6}}$ ] , @xmath52_{\\bar{\\textbf{3}}}$ ] , @xmath53_{{\\bar{\\textbf{3}}}/{\\textbf{6}}}$ ] and @xmath54_{{\\bar{\\textbf{3}}}/{\\textbf{6}}}$ ] , respectively .",
    "other diquark configurations @xmath52_{\\textbf{6}}$ ] and @xmath55_{\\bar{\\textbf{3}}}$ ] are forbidden due to the fermi - dirac statistics for identical particles .",

    "for the photoproduction mechanism , the initial photon is emitted from the electron , which can be described by the weizs@xmath56cker - williams approximation ( wwa )  @xcite . when considering the extrinsic heavy - quark mechanism",
    ", we should pay special attention to avoid the ",
    "double counting \" problem between the @xmath57 and the extrinsic @xmath58 channels .",
    "a proper approach to deal with the extrinsic heavy quark is to employ the general - mass variable - flavor - number scheme ( gm - vfns )  @xcite . according to the pqcd factorization theorem ,",
    "the cross section for the photoproduction of @xmath3 within the gm - vfns scheme can be written as      where @xmath60 is the wwa photon density function , @xmath61 is the parton distribution function ( pdf ) of parton @xmath62 inside a proton @xmath63 , @xmath64 is the factorization scale , and @xmath65 + x)$ ] is the hard cross section for the partonic process @xmath66+x$ ] .",

    "the partonic hard cross section can be written as @xmath88 + x)= \\frac{{\\bf \\overline{\\sum } } |\\mathcal{m}|^2}{4\\sqrt{(p_{1}+p_2)^2}|\\vec { p}_{1}| } d\\phi_j,\\ ] ] where @xmath89 denotes the average of the spin and color states of initial particles and the sum of the color and spin states of all final particles , and @xmath90 represents the final @xmath91-body phase space element , @xmath92 and @xmath93 is the total hard scattering amplitude @xmath94 where @xmath95 runs over the related feynman diagrams .",

    "practically , those diagrams are the same as the diagrams without exchanging , since we have set the relative velocity between the two @xmath6 quarks to be zero , i.e. , we have set @xmath105 for the production of @xmath106 by applying the nonrelativistic approximation .",
    "there is a factor of @xmath107 for the square of the amplitude due to the two identical quarks inside the @xmath108 $ ] diquark .",
