    "as the application of statistical - physics techniques becomes more widespread and acceptable outside the traditional physics community , it is clear that the phenomena of phase transitions have important roles to play there .",
    "indeed , phase transitions are common to a very wide range of disciplines , from physics to biology , economics and even to sociology .",
    "as statistical physics finds pertinence in these areas , so too can the field draw on concepts outside the confines of pure physics .    in all of these disciplines",
    ", models are characterised by certain sets of parameters .",
    "the idea of endowing the space of such parameters with a metric and geometrical structure has been borrowed from parametric statistics @xcite . given a probability distribution @xmath2 , and a sample @xmath3 ,",
    "the objective is to estimate the parameter @xmath4 .",
    "this may be done by maximizing the so - called likelihood function , @xmath5 , or its logarithm ( called the log - likelihood function ) , @xmath6 the gradient of this quantity is the score function : @xmath7 and the expectation of this random variable is zero ( @xmath8=0 $ ] ) .",
    "its variance is @xmath9 = { \\rm{e } } \\left [ \\frac{-d^2 \\ln{l(\\theta)}}{d\\theta^2 } \\right ] \\quad .\\ ] ] this quantity is called the expected or fisher information .",
    "taylor expanding the log - likelihood function , one arrives at @xmath10 the first term on the right - hand side is zero at the true @xmath4-value .",
    "therefore , the closeness of two probability distributions characterised by @xmath4 and @xmath11 , is given by the second term , or the fisher information .",
    "for higher - dimensional distributions ( which may be continuous ) , where , instead of @xmath4 , one has a set of parameters , @xmath12 , the fisher information is defined as @xmath13   =   -\\int {   p(x|\\theta )    \\frac{\\partial^2 \\ln{p(x|\\theta)}}{\\partial \\theta_i \\partial \\theta_j } dx } \\quad .\\ ] ] c.r .",
    "rao suggested this is a metric .",
    "it is , in fact , the only suitable metric in parametric statistics and is called the fisher - rao metric @xcite .    in generic statistical - physics models",
    ", we have two parameters , @xmath14 , which we may think of as the inverse temperature , and @xmath15 , the external field . in this case",
    "the fisher - rao metric is simply given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the reduced free energy per site and @xmath18 .",
    "for such a metric the scalar curvature may be calculated as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the determinant of the metric itself .",
    "the scalar curvature plays a central role in any attempt to look at phase transitions from a geometrical perspective .",
    "indeed , @xmath0 measures the complexity of the system .",
    "a flat metric implies that the system is not interacting .",
    "conversely , and for all the models that have been considered so far , the curvature diverges at ( and only at ) a phase transition point for physical ranges of the parameter values .    using standard scaling assumptions",
    ", we can anticipate the behaviour of @xmath0 near a second - order critical point . with @xmath21 , @xmath22 where @xmath23 are the scaling dimensions for the energy and spin operators and",
    "@xmath24 is the spacial dimensionality .",
    "one finds for the scalar curvature , @xmath25 and @xmath26 yielding @xmath27 where hyperscaling ( @xmath28 ) is assumed and @xmath29 is the correlation length .",
    "the systems hitherto analysed from the information - geometry perspective include the ising model in one dimension @xcite , the bethe lattice ising and mean - field models @xcite .",
    "the main results hitherto established are that @xmath0 is positive definite and diverges ( as @xmath30 ) only at the critical point .    in an effort to see how generic these features are , and to discover new ones , we analyse the potts model in one dimension , the ising model in two dimensions coupled to quantum gravity and the spherical model in three dimensions .",
    "* the potts model in one dimension : * the one - dimensional @xmath31-state potts model , like its ising counterpart ( which corresponds to @xmath32 ) is exactly solvable .",
    "although it has no true phase transition , thermodynamic quantities diverge at zero temperature . in the ising case",
    ", explicit calculations showed that @xmath33 the correlation length is known to behave as @xmath34 , and therefore @xmath35 as @xmath36 .    for plotting purposes , it is convenient to introduce @xmath37 the curvature is plotted in fig .",
    "[ potts ] .",
    "it is clear that @xmath38 is positive definite and exhibits a @xmath39 ( or @xmath40 ) symmetry .",
    "furthermore , given a particular value for @xmath41 , @xmath38 is maximum along the zero - field ridge @xmath42 .",
    "the one - dimensional @xmath31-state potts model is also exactly solvable , so it is sensible to exploit it in an attempt to decide which of the previous features are generic .",
    "an explicit calculation @xcite shows that @xmath43 for @xmath44 and @xmath45 . here , @xmath46 is the potts analogue of the ising term , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 and @xmath49 are smooth functions of @xmath41 and @xmath50 .",
    "so the expected scaling ( [ ex ] ) holds with @xmath51 or @xmath52 .",
    "figure  [ potts ] also shows that , in the potts case , @xmath53 is no longer positive definite .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath54 symmetry of the ising model is no longer present . for a given @xmath41 , @xmath55 no longer peaks along @xmath42 .",
    "finally , an analysis of the lee - yang ( complex @xmath15 ) zeroes of the model reveals that the curvature also diverges as the locus of zeroes , @xmath56 , is approached .",
    "in fact , @xmath57 so that this divergence is characterised by an edge exponent @xmath58 .",
    "* the three - dimensional spherical model ( and the ising model on planar random graphs ) : * the spherical model is given by @xmath59      } } \\quad , \\ ] ] and can be solved by exponentiating the constraint and using steepest descent . allowing the lattice extent , @xmath60 , to diverge reveals no transition for @xmath61 .",
    "the transition for @xmath62 has @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "this is the same set of critical exponents as for the ising model on planar random graphs ( matter coupled to 2d gravity ) .",
    "this is remarkable , because there are no obvious similarities between the two models .",
    "explicit calculations ( in both models ) give @xcite @xmath66 which does _ not _ accord with the prediction of ( [ ex ] ) .",
    "that prediction is @xmath67 , with @xmath68 .",
    "the source of the discrepancy can be traced back to the top left term in the determinant in ( [ reason ] ) , which is @xmath69 . in both current models , @xmath70 is , in fact , negative and this term vanishes as criticality is approached .",
    "it is replaced by a constant term coming from the regular part of the free energy . both models",
    "then yield the same result ( [ jkb ] ) .",
    "in statistical physics , and in related fields  from the bio - sciences to economics  phase transitions play a central role . thus new insights into the characterisation of critical phenomena",
    "are of paramount importance . here , geometric ideas from the field of parametric statistics are `` borrowed '' and explored . it is found that the curvature associated with the fisher - rao metric is , indeed , a useful quantity in the characterisation of phase transitions .",
    "some features found in the ising model are found not to be generic . in particular",
    ", @xmath0 can be negative and there is no symmetry nor ridge along @xmath44 .",
    "more surprisingly , the naively expected scaling behaviour ( [ ex ] ) fails in both the three - dimensional spherical model and in the ising model on planar random graphs .",
    "reasons for this are given .",
    "once again , it is curious that all critical exponents for the latter two models coincide , although there is no obvious physical relation between them ."
