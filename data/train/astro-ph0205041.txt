    "low - mass star formation is believed to occur predominantly in molecular cloud cores .",
    "the commonly accepted scenario is that dense molecular clouds are supported against self - gravity by magnetic and thermal stresses .",
    "since the gas is only weakly ionized , the clouds are not in a strict steady state : the prevalent neutral molecules , pulled in by the force of gravity , gradually drift inward through the magnetic field ( attached to the ionized component and anchored in the cloud envelope ) in a process known as ambipolar diffusion .",
    "when the mass - to - flux ratio in the cloud core exceeds a critical value , the core undergoes gravitational collapse to form a central protostar .",
    "the core evolution after the collapse is initiated can in general be divided into two phases : a rapid initial dynamical contraction , which proceeds nonhomologously and eventually results in the formation of a central point mass , followed by an accretion phase , during which the central mass gradually increases and its gravitational field dominates a progressively larger region around the origin .",
    "the evolution of star - forming molecular clouds has been studied mostly through numerical simulations ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a review ) . until recently",
    ", these calculations were terminated before the end of the dynamical - collapse phase , basically at the point where radiative trapping near the center started to invalidate the isothermality assumption adopted in these computations .",
    "however , @xcite ( @xcite , hereafter ck ) circumvented this problem by treating the comparatively small region of radiative trapping as a central sink cell ; this enabled them to model the collapse of nonrotating magnetic cloud cores through point - mass formation ( pmf ) and into the protostellar accretion phase .",
    "concurrently , @xcite ( @xcite , hereafter cck ) obtained semianalytic self - similar solutions that explicitly accounted for the effects of ambipolar diffusion and successfully reproduced the main qualitative features of the numerical simulations of ck .",
    "our goal in this paper is to extend the previous work on the post - pmf evolution of collapsing magnetic cloud cores by including the effects of rotation .",
    "molecular line observations ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) have established that a majority of dense ( @xmath9 ) cloud cores show evidence of rotation , with angular velocities@xmath10 that tend to be uniform on scales of @xmath11 , and with specific angular momenta in the range@xmath12 .",
    "although present , the rotation contributes only a small fraction ( typically no more than a few percent ) to the dynamical support of these cores , and self - gravity is mostly balanced by magnetic and thermal stresses . during their quasistatic contraction phase ,",
    "the cores evidently lose angular momentum by means of magnetic braking  the magnetic transfer of angular momentum to the ambient gas through torsional alfvn waves  and this process also tends to align their angular velocity and large - scale magnetic field vectors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "once dynamical collapse is initiated and a core goes into a near  free - fall state , the specific angular momentum is expected to be approximately conserved , resulting in a progressive increase in the centrifugal force that eventually halts the collapse and gives rise to a rotationally supported disk .",
    "these expectations are consistent with the results of molecular - line interferometric observations , which have probed contracting cloud cores on scales @xmath13 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these observations have revealed that , on scales @xmath14 , the cores have a flattened , thick - disk morphology and a velocity field that is dominated by infall motions ( with only a modest rotational component ) .",
    "this morphology is consistent with numerical simulations of magnetically supported clouds , which have demonstrated that the gas rapidly contracts along the field lines and maintains force equilibrium along the field even during the collapse phase ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; ck ) , including in cases where the clouds are initially elongated in the field direction ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the observations have also established that angular momentum is by and large conserved in the infalling gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and leads to the formation of rotationally supported disks on scales @xmath15 .",
    "the pre - pmf collapse of rotating , magnetized , weakly ionized cloud cores was previously studied by @xcite .",
    "they found that little angular momentum is lost during the dynamical - collapse phase but that the centrifugal force nevertheless does not become important prior to pmf . in the current work we focus on the post - pmf phase of the collapse , which enables us to model the formation of circumstellar disks in the context of magnetic cloud cores and to study their properties and their role in the buildup of the central protostar .",
    "circumstellar disks have been detected in @xmath16 of pre  main - sequence stars in nearby dark clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and it is likely that most of the mass assembled in a typical low - mass young stellar object ( yso ) is accreted through a disk ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "the study of protostellar disks is important also because they are the incubators of planetary systems , so their properties are directly relevant to the process of planet formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the rotational properties of the collapsing core are evidently also of particular relevance to the question of multiple - star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in the ensuing discussion we assume that the collapsing core does not give rise to more than one stellar object ; we nevertheless briefly address the issue of core fragmentation in   [ discussion ] .",
    "the studies of ck and cck demonstrated that ambipolar diffusion , which is unimportant during the dynamical pre - pmf collapse phase , is `` revitalized '' after a point mass starts to grow in the center and leads to a decoupling of the magnetic flux from the inflowing gas .",
    "it was found that the `` decoupling front '' propagates outward in the form of a hydromagnetic shock ( as originally suggested by @xcite ) and that this process can go a long way toward resolving the magnetic flux problem in star formation ( the several - orders - of - magnitude discrepancy between the empirical upper limit on the magnetic flux of a protostar and the flux associated with the corresponding mass in the pre - collapse core ) . by incorporating rotation into the picture",
    ", we can study how this issue is affected by the formation of a disk .",
    "furthermore , as our model includes angular momentum transport ( by the large - scale magnetic field ) , which is crucial for enabling mass to accumulate in the center and form a protostar ( see   [ formulation ] ) , we are also in a position to address the angular momentum problem in star formation ( analogous to the magnetic flux problem , except that the quantity under consideration is the specific angular momentum ) .",
    "the emergence of a quasi - stationary , rotationally supported disk from a nearly freely falling , collapsing core inevitably involves a strong deceleration of the inflowing matter , which almost invariably takes place in a shock .",
    "this `` centrifugal '' shock is distinct from the ambipolar - diffusion shock mentioned above : it is typically hydrodynamic , rather than hydromagnetic , in nature , and it is generally located at a different distance from the center .",
    "the appearance of a second shock increases the complexity of the problem , and it might seem that it could only be tackled through a multi - scale numerical simulation .",
    "however , we have found that it is possible to treat this problem semianalytically by generalizing the self - similar solutions presented in cck to include the effects of rotation and magnetic braking .",
    "although this treatment is somewhat less detailed than a numerical simulation , the semianalytic approach allows us to more readily explore the fairly extensive parameter space .",
    "this approach is supported by the strong evidence from numerical simulations that a multiscale core collapse naturally leads to a self - similar evolution .",
    "in particular , this behavior has been found to describe the effectively magnetic flux- and angular momentum - conserving _",
    "pre_-pmf collapse phase of a rotating magnetic core seen in the aforementioned numerical simulations of @xcite ( @xcite ; @xcite ; see also @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "as regards the post - pmf evolution , @xcite obtained similarity solutions for flattened cloud cores that approximate previous numerical simulations of the collapse of rotating clouds through the moment when a central point mass could be expected to form .",
    "the good correspondence between the cck solutions and the nonrotating magnetic collapse simulations of ck further strengthens our confidence in the viability of this approach .    in relating this work to previously published results , we note that neither the @xcite model nor the numerical simulations with which they compare their solutions incorporate an angular momentum transport mechanism , and therefore they do not in practice give rise to a central point mass .",
    "( nevertheless , as we discuss in   [ nonmagnetic ] , their post - pmf solutions correspond to a limiting case of the more general model considered in this paper . )",
    "it is also worth mentioning in this connection that self - similar models of the gravitational collapse of rotating , disk - like mass distributions that incorporate _ viscous _ angular momentum transport have been constructed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , the former model arbitrarily imposes an inner boundary condition that does not allow mass to accumulate at the center , whereas the latter model is restricted to the case in which the inflow speed is everywhere so low that no centrifugal shock forms .",
    "neither of these models therefore provides a realistic framework for studying star formation in rotating molecular cloud cores .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in   [ model ] we formulate the problem , discuss the adopted approximations , and describe the self - similar model . in   [ results ]",
    "we present illustrative solutions , ordered by increasing level of complexity , which isolate different aspects of the full problem .",
    "we use the flexibility afforded by our semianalytic approach to examine the dependence of the results on the efficiency of ambipolar diffusion and magnetic braking and to elucidate the interplay between these two processes .",
    "we give a general discussion of these solutions and of their astrophysical implications in ",
    "[ discussion ] , where we also consider the production of centrifugally driven disk outflows .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in   [ summary ] .",
    "our basic model setup is the same as in cck .",
    "we consider an isothermal , disklike core that contracts in the radial direction while maintaining a vertical hydrostatic equilibrium at all times . as noted in   [ introduction ] , this behavior was found in numerical simulations of isothermal cores that are initially supported against gravitational collapse by a large - scale , ordered magnetic field .",
    "nonmagnetic simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have established that rotation could further contribute to the tendency of a core to flatten as it contracts so long as the specific angular momentum is approximately conserved . in restricting gas motions in our model to the plane of the flattened core",
    ", we preclude the possibility that matter can reach the center from above ( or below ) the disk , and this , in turn , implies that a point mass can form in the center only if there exists a mechanism for removing angular momentum from the inflowing gas .",
    "there have also been models in which the complementary view has been adopted , viz .",
    ", new mass is added to the protostar and its circumstellar disk only from above and below the disk plane ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these models tend to produce rotationally supported disks whose masses are comparable to that of the central star , even if angular momentum transport within the disk is taken into account ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , most observed protostellar disks in nearby dark clouds have masses ( estimated from dust emission or , when possible , from a direct measurement of the disk velocity field ) that are significantly smaller ( @xmath17 ) than the protostellar mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as we demonstrate in   [ results ]",
    ", such low - mass systems can form naturally when mass flows into the central region primarily in the disk plane .",
    "given that this is the expected situation for magnetically regulated core contraction and that the disklike configurations predicted in this case are consistent with observations of collapsing cloud cores , we consider this approximation to be adequate for capturing the essence of protostellar - disk and star formation .",
    "the isothermality assumption was justified in the work of ck and cck on the grounds that it generally applies so long as the density remains below @xmath18 , which for a typical nonrotating collapse is the case on scales @xmath19",
    ". this assumption is less tenable in the present work because , when a quasi - stationary , centrifugally supported disk forms , it has a significantly higher column density at a given radius than a nearly freely falling configuration , with the result that radiative trapping already occurs on scales @xmath15 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "irradiation by the central protostar tends to mitigate this effect and establish vertical isothermality in the outer regions of the disk , but , in turn , it leads to a moderately strong ( @xmath20 ) variation of the disk temperature with radius ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , since thermal stresses turn out not to play a major role in the core - collapse dynamics , the assumption of isothermality ( which is required for self - similarity ) is not likely to introduce significant inaccuracies into the results .",
    "another requirement for self - similarity is that the ion density @xmath21 be proportional to the square root of the neutral mass density ( which is essentially equal to the total gas density @xmath22 ) . in this case , the ratio @xmath23 of the neutral  ion momentum - exchange time scale @xmath24 to the nominal self - gravity free - fall time @xmath25 is independent of density and can be treated as a constant . is smaller than the one used in cck by a factor @xmath26 . ]",
    "this behavior is found at comparatively low densities , when molecular ionization by cosmic rays ( at a rate @xmath27 ) is balanced by rapid dissociative recombination of the molecular ions and the dominant positive charges are metal ions ( formed by a charge - exchange reaction between molecular ions and neutral metal atoms and destroyed by recombination on grain surfaces ) . for grains of radius @xmath28 , a temperature @xmath29 , and @xmath30",
    ", this scaling applies roughly at neutral particle densities between @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these values of @xmath33 and @xmath34 characterize the outer regions of collapsing cores , typically on scales @xmath35 ( e.g. , ck ) . in this regime , @xmath36 .",
    "the numerical models of ck extended to scales @xmath37 , where densities @xmath38 were attained . in the case of a rotationally supported disk , even higher densities are expected on these scales . at such high densities , grains are typically the dominant carriers of both positive and negative charges , and their densities also scale as @xmath39 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "assuming , for the sake of illustration , that the charged grain distribution is dominated by a population of small ( pah - like ) singly charged particles of radius @xmath40 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we can deduce the charged - grain number density @xmath41 from the ionization balance relation @xmath42 where @xmath43 ( with @xmath44 ) is the reduced grain mass .",
    "taking as fiducial values @xmath45 and @xmath46 at a distance @xmath47 from the center of a rotationally supported protostellar disk , we can neglect the factor 1 in comparison with the second term in the last parentheses on the right - hand side of equation ( [ charge ] ) ( which accounts for the electrostatic attraction between the recombining grains ) .",
    "we then get @xmath48 . assuming that the small grains are characterized by the same rate coefficient for momentum transfer through elastic scattering with neutrals as metal ions ( @xmath49 ; see @xcite ) , we obtain @xmath50 in this density regime . ambipolar diffusion will dominate ohmic diffusivity so long as the grain hall parameter @xmath51 ( the ratio of the cyclotron frequency to the collision frequency with neutrals ) exceeds 1 . adopting a fiducial magnetic field strength at @xmath52 of @xmath53 , we find @xmath54 , which we expect to climb securely above 1 as the density continues to decrease with increasing @xmath55 .",
    "we thus infer that both the low- and the high - density regimes of our model collapsing cores correspond to ambipolar diffusion that is amenable to self - similar scaling",
    ". the intermediate density regime will depart from this scaling ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and it is also likely to involve significant contributions from the hall current term in ohm s law ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "nevertheless , given that our bracketing values of the parameter @xmath23 vary by only one order of magnitude ( assuming that @xmath56 lies in the range @xmath57 ) across @xmath58 orders of magnitude in density , we may expect our diffusivity parameterization to yield qualitatively meaningful results on all scales between @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "just as in cck , we take the initial ( @xmath61 ) state of our model core to coincide with the endpoint of the pre - pmf collapse phase , which is characterized by a radial scaling of the surface density @xmath62 and the vertical magnetic field component @xmath63 @xmath64 and by spatially constant radial inflow velocity @xmath65 ( where @xmath66 is the isothermal speed of sound ) and mass accretion rate @xmath67 . in the presence of rotation",
    ", this state also exhibits a uniform azimuthal speed . since the latter is typically much smaller than the speed of sound @xmath68 , we normalize our initial state as in cck based on the nonrotational collapse simulations of ck ( @xmath69 and @xmath70 ) .",
    "we determine the initial value of @xmath71 ( which we denote by @xmath72 ) from the expression @xmath73 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are , respectively , the uniform background angular velocity and magnetic field strength . based on the range of measured core angular velocities ( see   [ introduction ] ) , @xmath72 could be a factor @xmath76 larger or smaller than the fiducial value adopted in equation ( [ v0 ] ) .",
    "we assume that magnetic braking , which regulates the core rotation prior to its collapse , remains the dominant angular momentum transport mechanism also during the subsequent evolution .",
    "[ a centrifugally driven disk wind may , however , dominate the angular momentum transport in the rotationally supported disk . in ",
    "[ results ] we argue that this is , indeed , a likely possibility , and in appendix  [ wind ] we show that this mechanism can be incorporated into our model without significantly modifying the basic formulation .",
    "] we adopt the approach articulated by @xcite for the pre - pmf collapse phase .",
    "the torque per unit mass on the slab - like core ( of surface mass density @xmath62 ) can be approximated by @xmath77 , where @xmath63 is the vertical field component at the midplane and @xmath78 is the azimuthal field component at the surface @xmath79 ( assuming @xmath80 ) .",
    "the latter can be estimated from the relation @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the magnetic flux threading the core within a radius @xmath55 , @xmath83 is the azimuthal speed of the core ions , and @xmath84 is the speed with which the torsional alfvn waves that effect the magnetic braking propagate in the external medium . equation ( [ bm ] ) is the same as equation ( 26 ) in @xcite , where @xmath84 is also treated as a constant , except that we substituted the ion speed for the bulk ( neutral ) speed to take account of the possibility that the ions ( into which the magnetic field is frozen ) are not well coupled to the neutral core component ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .    the assumption of a constant @xmath84 is consistent with theoretical models of magnetically supported clouds as well as with empirical data , which indicate that @xmath85 in molecular clouds over at least 4 orders of magnitude in density ( @xmath86 ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this assumption is required for the construction of a self - similar model . in order for the steady - state expression ( [ bm ] ) to be applicable , the alfvn travel time in the external medium over the initial radius of the cloud should be less than the evolutionary time scale @xmath87 ( which , for a rotationally supported disk , is essentially the local magnetic braking time ) .",
    "our representative rotationally supported disk models typically have @xmath88 ( with @xmath89 as @xmath90 ) , whereas , for a nominal temperature of @xmath91 , @xmath92 .",
    "these estimates indicate that the assumption of rapid braking should not lead to gross errors even if it is not everywhere strictly correct . in our models",
    "we use the parameterization @xmath93 , with @xmath94 adopted as a typical value",
    ".    we will be interested in evaluating the effects of magnetic braking in regions where rotation already plays a dynamically significant role , so that @xmath95 .",
    "we can therefore drop @xmath74 in equation ( [ bm ] ) , which will make it possible to incorporate this equation into a self - similar formulation .",
    "the anticipated increase in @xmath96 with decreasing @xmath55 ( @xmath97 when a keplerian disk is formed ) will in general make @xmath78 the dominant field component at the surface as the central point mass is approached .",
    "( this situation is not encountered in the pre - pmf phase ; see @xcite . )",
    "we expect , however , that various magnetohydrodynamic instabilities ( in particular , internal kinks ) will intervene to prevent the azimuthal field component from greatly exceeding the poloidal components .",
    ", we also do not expect the radial surface field component to greatly exceed the vertical field @xmath63 under realistic circumstances .",

    "we have studied three distinct cases of rotational core collapse , which we present in this section in order of increasing complexity .",
    "they are : ( 1 ) a purely hydrodynamical collapse , with no mechanism for angular momentum transport (   [ nonmagnetic ] ) ; ( 2 ) an ideal - mhd ( imhd ) collapse , which incorporates magnetic braking but does not include any magnetic field diffusivity that could prevent the buildup of a central magnetic monopole (   [ mhd ] ) ; ( 3 ) an mhd collapse that includes ambipolar diffusion ( ad ;   [ ad ] ) .",
    "the latter model is able to reproduce the basic observational features of rotationally supported protostellar disks and their central ysos .",
    "our models have many features in common , arising from the basic interplay between the centrifugal force and gravity . initially and at large distances from the center ( i.e. , for large values of @xmath134 ) , gravity is stronger than the centrifugal force and matter falls in at a high , supersonic speed . in this regime @xmath194 , and self - gravity dominates over attraction by the central object .",

[ 1 ] ) is the development of a mass `` plateau '' when the infall speed starts to increase above its outer asymptotic ( @xmath216 ) value .",

    "it is also convenient to introduce the auxiliary constant @xmath249 , which is useful for describing the effect of the magnetic `` dilution '' of the gravitational field @xcite .",

    "the first set , presented in equations ( [ mhdasymptoticbegin])([mhdasymptoticend ] ) below , applies to the configurations described in   [ mhdstandard ] and   [ mhdfast ] .",
    "the second set , presented in   [ mhdstrong ] , applies only in the strong - braking case .",

    "the @xmath142 profile corresponding to such a disk implies that @xmath244 decreases with decreasing @xmath134 . the magnetic braking required to account for this change from the initial distribution fixes the strength and radial power - law index of the magnetic field components @xmath254 and @xmath255 .",

    "these are also the systems with the most accurate determinations of the disk mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : the massive envelopes surrounding class 0 ysos prevent their disk masses from being pinned down , and even in the case of class i sources the values of @xmath2 are not as well determined ( although they appear to be similar to the disk masses in class ii systems ) . it has occasionally been suggested in the literature that protostellar disks may not be keplerian during the early ( in particular , class-0 ) phase of their evolution , when the ratio of the central mass to that of the surrounding envelope is still small .",
    "our results demonstrate that this need not be the case .",
    "in fact , in the self - similar solutions that we derive , if the mass of the rotationally supported disk is small in comparison with the central mass at any given time , it will be so at all times .",

    "there have been reports in the literature of t tauri circumstellar disks that exhibit keplerian rotation on somewhat larger scales [ e.g. , gm aur , with @xmath401 @xcite , and dm tau , with @xmath402 @xcite .",
    "it is quite possible that these disks have achieved their large sizes already during their early evolutionary stages .",

    "it is , however , also conceivable that at least part of the cause for large observed disk sizes in these highly evolved ( and no longer strongly accreting ) systems is post - formation viscous spreading of the disk ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "we are not aware of any observational evidence as yet for the existence of such rings in protostellar systems , but there have been several recent reports of well - defined dust rings with similar radii ( @xmath406 ) and fractional widths around older , vega - like stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although the apparent confinement of the latter rings is usually attributed to the presence of solid `` satellites '' ( e.g. , planets ) , it is interesting to speculate that their origin could be traced to the @xmath62 enhancements predicted by our solutions .",
    "an important implication of the result that typical rotating inflows tend to produce a central mass that is surrounded by a keplerian disk is that the angular momentum problem ( see   [ introduction ] ) for the modeled yso is basically resolved . in particular ,",
    "angular momentum transport can be sufficiently efficient to allow most of the inflowing mass to end up ( with effectively no angular momentum ) at the center , with the central mass dominating the dynamics well beyond the outer edge of the disk even as the inflow is still in progress .",
    "our solutions reveal that the ad shock , even though it is usually located well outside the region where the centrifugal force becomes important , helps to enhance the efficiency of angular momentum transport through the magnetic field amplification that it induces . in practice",
    ", the ultimate value of the protostellar angular momentum would be determined by the braking mechanism that enables the yso to reduce its angular velocity below the centrifugal - equilibrium value that characterizes the accreted disk matter ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the formation of keplerian circumstellar disks in our `` standard '' solutions is a consequence of efficient magnetic braking , which allows the mass injected at large distances to reach the center rather than pile up in the disk ( as it does in the fast - rotation solutions discussed in   [ mhdfast ] and   [ adfast ] ) .",
    "the disk in these cases therefore has little influence on the mass accretion rate onto the central yso , @xmath407 , which is determined on scales much larger than @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , as we discuss in   [ nonmagnetic ] , the eigenvalue @xmath185 is typically also insensitive to the magnetic structure of the flow and is often well approximated by the `` plateau '' value @xmath272 ( eq .  [ [ m_pl ] ] ) that depends only on the initial conditions .",
    "( for our fiducial parameters , @xmath408 , implying @xmath409 . )",
    "the likely production of a centrifugally driven wind that transports mass away from the disk surfaces ( see discussion below ) will , however , act to reduce the value of @xmath185 : as we estimate in appendix  [ wind ] , the reduction factor could be as large as @xmath410 .",
    "the presence of rotation also does not strongly affect the `` revitalization '' of ambipolar diffusion behind the ad shock , which , as we noted in   [ introduction ] , can go a long way toward resolving the magnetic flux problem .",
    "this conclusion applies even in the fast - rotation case ( see   [ adfast ] ) , where the ad shock is replaced by a more gradual transition occurring within the disk .",
    "the asymptotic @xmath206 similarity solution for the disk implies that , at any given time , the magnetic flux scales as @xmath411 ( see eq .  [ [ adpsistandard ] ] ) , which represents a slower decrease with @xmath55 than in the nonrotating case ( in which @xmath412 ; see eq .",
    "[ [ adpsistrong ] ] ) .",
    "however , in reality , the amount of magnetic flux that ends up threading the protostar would depend on the detailed flux transport and destruction mechanisms that operate in the inner disk and the star , which may involve ohmic resistivity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the quasi - equilibrium disk configurations described by our solutions make it possible to investigate the stability properties of the modeled circumstellar disks .",
    "although a full pursuit of this topic is beyond the scope of this paper , we comment briefly on the basic mhd and gravitational instabilities that may affect the disks .",
    "the most relevant mhd instability is evidently the magnetorotational one , which is expected to develop rapidly in any differentially rotating disk that is threaded by a subthermal magnetic field ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "this instability has been shown to generate turbulence that can remove angular momentum from the inflowing gas , so the determination of whether the disk is susceptible to this instability also has implications to the self - consistency of our identification of magnetic braking as the dominant angular - momentum transport mechanism in the disk .",
    "as it turns out , our diffusive keplerian disk models are by and large magnetorotationally _",
    "stable_. physically , this is because the coupling between the matter and the field is generally too weak to allow the instability to grow .",
    "specifically , a necessary condition for this instability to operate in a weakly ionized , keplerian disk is @xmath413 , where @xmath414 is the keplerian angular velocity @xcite . using our self - similar variables",
    ", this criterion can be written as @xmath415 . since the keplerian disk region in all of our typical solutions nearly coincides with",
    "the region where the inner asymptotic solution ( eqs .",
    "[ [ asymptoticm]][[asymptotich ] ] ) is applicable , we can use the latter to evaluate the left - hand side of the above inequality ; it is found to equal @xmath416 .",
    "[ the asymptotic solution satisfies the weak - field condition @xmath417 postulated in the derivation of the instability criterion ; indeed , the left - hand side of the latter inequality ( which equals @xmath418 ) vanishes ( @xmath419 ) as @xmath206 . ] but the parameter @xmath277 ( defined in ",
    "[ formulation ] ) is expected to be @xmath420 , and therefore the instability condition @xmath421 is not satisfied .",
    "interestingly , our fiducial imhd solution is also magnetorotationally stable . in this case",
    "the strong magnetic squeezing prevents the unstable perturbations from fitting inside the disk .",
    "formally , one requires the critical wavelength @xmath422 to be less than the disk thickness @xmath423 for the disk to be unstable . using the inner asymptotic solution given by equations ( [ mhdasymptoticbegin])([mhdasymptoticend ] ) , with the help",
    "of which we first verify that @xmath424 again tends to zero as @xmath206 , this condition translates into @xmath425 . for our typical parameters this requires @xmath426 , but this lower bound exceeds @xmath195 ( the approximate disk outer boundary ) for this solution .",
    "the above results support the choice of magnetic braking as the main angular momentum transport mechanism in our disk model .",
    "this mechanism remains effective even in the presence of ambipolar diffusion because the neutral  ion collision time @xmath24 , while being comparatively long , is shorter than the magnetic braking time @xmath427 . in a keplerian accretion disk @xmath428 and @xmath429",
    "is typically much smaller than the keplerian speed ; therefore @xmath430 can be @xmath431 even if @xmath432 exceeds 1 .",
    "this conclusion continues to hold when the angular momentum transport in the disk ( and hence the accretion time @xmath433 ) is controlled by a centrifugally driven wind rather than by the propagation of torsional alfvn waves . as we show in appendix  [ wind ] , the basic formalism of our model is unchanged in this case , and the parameter @xmath277 ( which is now determined directly from the centrifugal wind solution ) is again typically small enough for the linear stability criterion @xmath434 to be satisfied over most of the disk column density .",
    "the argument against instability is reinforced by indications from numerical simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that mri - driven turbulence and the resulting angular - momentum transport are significant only when @xmath435 .",
    "we note in this connection that even a disk in which the bulk of the material is weakly coupled is expected to possess well coupled ( @xmath421 ) surface layers from which the centrifugal wind is launched ( see appendix  [ wind ] ) .",
    "it is , however , likely that the critical wavelength for instability exceeds the density scale height in the strongly coupled regions ( see @xcite and @xcite ) , so the surface layers should typically also be magnetorotationally stable .    the basic gravitational instability that we consider involves fragmentation induced by the disk self - gravity .",
    "the relevant stability condition against axisymmetric perturbations is given by the toomre criterion @xmath436 @xcite , where @xmath437^{1/2}$ ] is the epicyclic frequency .",
    "although this criterion is modified somewhat by magnetic effects ( @xcite ; r. krasnopolsky & a. knigl , in preparation ) , the corrections remain small for nearly keplerian disks , especially in the ad regime , and we therefore neglect them here .",
    "we have verified that the toomre criterion is well satisfied for most of our rotationally supported disk solutions , the only exceptions being the outermost ( backflow ) regions of the fast - rotation configurations ( figs .  [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , and [ 9 ] ) , where the effect of self - gravity is comparatively large .",
    "this result is significant in that it suggests that in typical cases protostellar disks may not fragment even during the early phases of their evolution , when the central mass is still small . in our model this behavior can be attributed to the fact that , for representative parameters , the central gravity already dominates at the location of the centrifugal shock , so that the disks are nearly keplerian from the start .",
    "inasmuch as the inequality @xmath438 signals the onset of self - gravity  induced angular - momentum transport in the disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this result also serves to justify the neglect of such a transport mechanism in our model .",
    "we note , however , that the collapsing core could in principle be unstable to fragmentation before point - mass formation , or , following pmf , in the region outside the rotationally supported disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is also conceivable that fragmentation might be initiated even before a dynamically unstable core is formed ( possibly triggered by an ad - mediated instability in the magnetically supported parent cloud ; see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "another potential angular - momentum transport mechanism that was not included in our model involves centrifugally driven disk outflows .",
    "for a cold , thin , keplerian disk that is threaded by open magnetic field lines , such an outflow could be launched if the angle between the meridional projection of the magnetic field and the rotation axis exceeds @xmath439 @xcite .",
    "this condition is satisfied by our asymptotic disk solutions  in particular , the ad inner asymptotic solution implies a radially constant inclination angle @xmath440 ( see eq .",
    "[ [ adpsistandard]]) so our model disks can be expected to give rise to outflows of this type .",
    "this result is encouraging in view of the fact that centrifugally driven disk outflows are a leading candidate for the origin of the bipolar outflows that are frequently observed to emanate from ysos ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a review ) . a centrifugally driven disk outflow can be incorporated into our model by taking account of the fact that the wind would be quasi - steady on the accretion time scale and should thus be well approximated by a steady - state formulation .",
    "the condition that the centrifugal outflow control the vertical angular momentum transport from the disk is equivalent to the requirement that the steady - state wind solution pass through the alfvn critical point .",
    "this requirement , in turn , serves to fix the value of @xmath78 ( or , equivalently , of the parameter @xmath277 ) in the disk solution . besides angular momentum",
    ", the wind also carries away mass , resulting in a progressive decline in the mass accretion rate with decreasing disk radius and leading to lower values of @xmath441 and @xmath232 at the center .",
    "interestingly , the radial scaling of the disk magnetic field ( @xmath442 ; see eq .  [ [ adbz ] ] ) implied by the asymptotic ad disk solution for any given value of @xmath391 is the same as in the @xcite radially self - similar , steady - state wind solution .",
    "this suggests that the latter solution can be used in conjunction with our disk model to fix the values of @xmath277 and of the @xmath185 reduction factor in the asymptotic disk solution .",
    "we discuss the implementation of this scheme in appendix  [ wind ] . inasmuch as the incorporation of a disk wind does not qualitatively change our basic results",
    ", we have not included its effects in the model described in   [ model ] so as not to unduly complicate the presentation .",
    "it is nevertheless important to recognize that our solutions indicate that the collapse of rotating , magnetic cloud cores naturally gives rise to disks with magnetic field configurations that are conducive to the launching of centrifugally driven winds .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the mhd core - collapse numerical simulations of @xcite , in which disk outflows that transport angular momentum through material and magnetic stresses are observed to form .",
    "( the possibility that a disk formed in the collapse of a magnetized rotating cloud core could give rise to a centrifugally driven wind was recognized also by @xcite . however , in contrast with our model , in their picture the angular momentum transport in the disk is dominated by turbulent viscosity and the outflow is concentrated near the outer disk radius ; furthermore , they infer that the mass outflow rate depends sensitively on the efficiency of magnetic braking in the precollapse core . )    we have also presented solutions (   [ mhdstrong ] and   [ adstrong ] ) in which the magnetic braking is sufficiently efficient to prevent the formation of a rotationally supported disk from the collapse of a rotating cloud core .",
    "although we argued that the parameter combinations characterizing these solutions are not typical , it is conceivable that such situations could be realized . a possible indication that this may sometimes be the case is provided by the detection of slowly rotating ysos that show no evidence ( from excess near- and mid - ir emission ) for the presence of a circumstellar disk @xcite .",
    "these observations are puzzling if one considers disk accretion to be a ubiquitous feature of star formation and interprets slow stellar rotation as due to a star  disk interaction ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the properties of these ysos are , however , readily understood if they are the product of a strongly braked core collapse .",
    "we study the collapse of rotating , magnetic molecular - cloud cores with the help of a self - similar model .",
    "this model generalizes the work of cck on nonrotating cloud cores by incorporating the effects of rotation and magnetic braking ( while also taking into account ambipolar diffusion and its dependence on the magnetic tension force as in the original model ) .",
    "we focus on the evolution after point - mass formation , noting that the pre - pmf collapse has already been studied by numerical simulations .",
    "our approach is motivated by previous findings that simulation results for the pre - pmf collapse of rotating cores and for the pre- and post - pmf collapse of nonrotating cores are well approximated by self - similar solutions .",
    "our semianalytic scheme allows us to examine the full range of expected behaviors and their dependence on the physical parameters .",
    "we present and analyze solutions for rotating but nonmagnetic collapsing cores , reproducing the results of @xcite ( @xcite ) , as well as for magnetic cores in the ideal - mhd and ambipolar - diffusion limits . in these two regimes",
    ", we distinguish between fiducial solutions , obtained for typical parameter values that correspond to moderately fast initial cloud rotation rate and moderately strong magnetic braking , and limiting cases of ( 1 ) fast rotation and ( 2 ) strong braking .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows :    * for representative parameter values , we obtain solutions that describe rotationally supported circumstellar disks of masses and sizes that are consistent with observations of ysos .",
    "our model thus makes it possible , for the first time , to study the formation of protostellar disks in the context of a realistic scenario of star formation in magnetically supported , weakly ionized molecular cloud cores .",
    "the outer boundary of the nearly stationary accretion disk roughly coincides with the location of the centrifugal shock , which typically occurs inward of the ambipolar - diffusion shock where the magnetic field decouples from the matter . *",
    "our solutions indicate that it is quite possible that t tauri ( class ii ) protostellar systems , whose disk masses are typically inferred to be @xmath17 of the central mass , have had a similarly low disk - to - star mass ratio also during their earlier ( class-0 and class - i ) evolutionary phases .",
    "* the disk configurations that we obtain exhibit surface - density enhancements near their outer boundaries ( encompassing @xmath17 of the disk mass and radius for typical parameters ) .",
    "we speculate that these features may be the precursors of the rings detected in some vega - like systems on scales @xmath15 . *",
    "our models allow us to elucidate the interplay between the ambipolar diffusion and magnetic braking processes .",

    "[ [ shockforceequation ] ] continues to play a role ) .",
    "however , in the solutions explored in this paper , the requirements that the central gravity dominate the vertical squeezing and that the imhd regime be applicable are never satisfied at the location of the centrifugal shock : in the fiducial and strong - gravity imhd cases , magnetic squeezing exceeds the tidal force in the central gravity - dominated region , whereas in the fast - rotation imhd and ad cases , self - gravity dominates at the location of the shock .",
    "as we note in   [ discussion ] , the asymptotic ambipolar - diffusion disk solution satisfies the launching condition @xmath536 for a cold , centrifugally driven wind , and , in fact , implies a radial scaling of the magnetic field components ( at any given instant of time ) that is identical to that of the time - independent , radially self - similar wind solution of @xcite ( @xcite , hereafter bp ) . once a super - alfvnic wind of this type is established , it constitutes the dominant mechanism of removing angular momentum from the disk ( at least in the vertical direction ) . furthermore ,",
    "if the outflow is quasi steady on the accretion time scale , then the spatially self - similar wind solution can be used to determine the value of @xmath78 ( or , equivalently , of the parameter @xmath277 ) in the asymptotic self - similar ( in space and time ) disk solution .",
    "an explicit wind solution also makes it possible to evaluate the reduction in the mass accretion rate onto the central star caused by the diversion of part of the inflowing mass into a disk outflow .",
    "motivated by these considerations , we now show how the centrifugally driven wind solution can be incorporated into the asymptotic ad disk model . as demonstrated in   [ adstandard ] ,",
    "the numerical solution of the disk equations typically converges rapidly behind the centrifugal shock to the asymptotic form given by equations ( [ asymptoticm])([asymptotich ] ) .",
    "this indicates that , if the model parameters do not strongly differ from the fiducial values , then the results that we obtain for the asymptotic regime should be applicable to the bulk of the rotationally supported disk that forms around the central object .",
    "the mass loss in the bp model is constant for each decade of disk radius and can be related to the accretion rate @xmath537 at the inner edge of the disk by @xmath538 where @xmath539 is the fraction of the disk binding energy at its inner edge @xmath540 that is carried off by the wind , and where @xmath148 is the total ( kinetic plus magnetic ) specific angular momentum in the wind , normalized by the keplerian disk value @xmath541 .",
    "the field - line constant @xmath148 is one of the three parameters that define a solution in the cold , self - similar bp wind model , the other two being @xmath542 and @xmath543 ( the normalized mass - to - magnetic flux ratio evaluated at the disk surface ) . as we noted above , for any given value of @xmath391 in the asymptotic ad disk solution",
    ", @xmath491 is a spatial constant ( @xmath544 ; see eq .",
    "[ [ adpsistandard ] ] ) that exceeds the launching threshold @xmath545 .",
    "it is thus natural to set @xmath546 .",
    "one can then evaluate the parameter @xmath547 by equating @xmath548 with the expression given by equation ( [ mdot_wind ] ) ( where the factor of 2 accounts for the two disk surfaces ) .",
    "the result ( in terms of the nondimensional flow quantities introduced in   [ selfsimilareqns ] ) is @xmath549 substituting for @xmath550 and @xmath254 from the asymptotic - solution equations ( [ asymptoticm ] ) and ( [ adbz ] ) , respectively , this becomes @xmath551 we now substitute for @xmath277 in the asymptotic disk solution the corresponding expression in the bp wind model , @xmath552 which yields @xmath553 although we started by evaluating @xmath547 , we ended up with an expression that gives @xmath148 in terms of @xmath554 .",
    "the latter parameter was treated by bp as being distinct from @xmath148 , but we are now able to relate them by combining the disk and wind solutions . by fixing the values of @xmath555 and @xmath148 , one can derive the value of @xmath547 from the solution of the self - similar wind equations ( see fig .  2 in bp ) , and thereby obtain @xmath277 ( using eq .",
    "[ [ delta ] ] ) . in practice , this `` recipe '' for incorporating the wind model does not alter our basic disk model since it effectively amounts to replacing one somewhat arbitrary parameter ( @xmath277 ) by another ( @xmath554 ) .",
    "however , by combining the disk and wind solutions , it is possible to constrain the parameter values . in particular , by requiring that the flow be magnetically dominated in the vicinity of the disk ( which implies @xmath556 ) and that it become super - alfvnic at a finite height , one can infer a lower bound on @xmath148 .",
    "based on figure 2 in bp , this lower limit is @xmath410 for @xmath546 ( which , by eq .",
    "[ [ lambda ] ] , implies that @xmath554 must be @xmath557 ) , and as @xmath148 increases from @xmath410 to @xmath558 ( corresponding to @xmath554 increasing from @xmath559 to @xmath560 ) , @xmath277 decreases from @xmath561 to @xmath562 .    in the absence of a disk outflow , the central mass eigenvalue @xmath185 is given approximately by the product @xmath563 evaluated at @xmath195 ( see eqs .  [",
    "[ mdot ] ] and [ [ asymptoticm ] ] ) .",
    "when the mass loss between the outer edge of the disk ( @xmath564 ) and its inner edge ( @xmath565 , the protostellar radius ) is taken into account in the mass conservation equation , the value of @xmath185 is reduced to @xmath566^{-1}(-xu\\sigma)_{x_c}\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath567 ( see eqs .",
    "[ [ mass4d ] ] , [ [ mdot_wind ] ] , and [ [ lambda ] ] ) .",
    "to the extent that deuterium burning causes the radius of the accreting protostar to increase roughly linearly with its mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath568 can be approximated as a constant .",
    "estimating @xmath1 from our fiducial ad solution ( see eq .",
    "[ [ xcadapproximation ] ] ) and @xmath569 from the mass  radius relation given by @xcite , we obtain @xmath570 .",
    "equation ( [ m_cw ] ) then implies that mass outflow from the disk surfaces could reduce the accretion rate onto the central object by a factor as large as @xmath410 ( using the minimum value of @xmath148 , which corresponds to @xmath571 ) .",
    "more strongly magnetized outflows have lower @xmath185 reduction factors : for example , when @xmath547 decreases to @xmath572 ( corresponding to @xmath573 and @xmath574 ) , this factor declines to @xmath575 .",
    "although the cumulative effect of the mass loss from the wind surfaces ( embodied in the factor @xmath576 ) can be significant , its impact at any given radius is comparatively small because of the large range of radii involved ( @xmath577 in the fiducial case ) .",
    "the incorporation of a disk wind modifies the integrated self - similar disk equations only through logarithmic terms in @xmath134 , so to lowest order the power - law scalings of the asymptotic disk solution remain unchanged .",
    "explicit models of ad - dominated , wind - driving accretion disks were previously constructed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "two general types of solutions were obtained , depending on the value of the neutral  ion coupling parameter @xmath578 .",
    "strongly coupled disks have @xmath579 at all heights and are characterized by the thermal pressure not being much larger than the magnetic pressure at @xmath102 , by @xmath580 starting to increase already near the midplane and generally exceeding @xmath581 at the disk surface ( which leads to a strong magnetic squeezing of the disk ) , and by the inflow speed typically being @xmath582 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in weakly coupled disks ( characterized by @xmath583 over the bulk of the vertical column ) the thermal pressure can be much larger than the magnetic pressure at @xmath102 , @xmath580 only starts to grow well above the midplane ( at a height where the coupling parameter finally rises above 1 ) and usually does not exceed @xmath581 at the surface ( which results in the magnetic squeezing remaining relatively unimportant ) , and the mass - averaged inflow speed is typically well below @xmath66 @xcite . as we point out in ",
    "[ discussion ] , @xmath584 is equal to @xmath416 in the asymptotic ad disk solution .",
    "this result is compatible with the just - described behavior of @xmath129 and @xmath132 : since @xmath585 in the asymptotic solution and @xmath586 , the expression for @xmath584 implies @xmath587 [ consistent with eq .  ( 4.5 ) in @xcite and eq .",
    "( 39 ) in @xcite ] .",
    "the values of @xmath277 derived from the bp wind solution indicate that our ad disks are likely to be weakly coupled .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with the low magnetic - to - thermal pressure ratio implied by the asymptotic disk solution ( it is @xmath588 as @xmath90 at any given instant of time ; see eqs .",
    "[ [ adsigma]][[asymptotich ] ] ) , which corresponds to the situation in weakly coupled disks .",
    "the association with the weakly coupled class of solutions is further indicated by the unimportance of magnetic squeezing in the asymptotic expression for the disk half - thickness ( eq .  [ [ asymptotich ] ] ) and by the subsonic inflow speed inferred in the asymptotic regime ( @xmath589 as @xmath90 and @xmath391 is held fixed ; see eq .",
    "[ [ adu ] ] ) .",
    "the inner regions of real protostellar disks ( on radial scales @xmath590 ) are , in fact , expected to be so weakly ionized over most of their interiors that the requisite field - line bending for launching a centrifugal wind can only occur in comparatively thin surface layers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "as was , however , already emphasized by @xcite , the properties of such disks and of their associated outflows depend sensitively on the details of the spatial profile of @xmath584 .",
    "further progress in developing these models will thus require a good understanding of the ionization structure in the inner regions of protostellar disks .",
