    "precise knowledge of the differential cross sections for quasi - elastic neutrino - nucleus scattering at a scale up to several tens of mev is of importance in understanding the explosion dynamics of supernova , since the neutrinos play a decisive role in the development between the prompt shock and the delayed shock  @xcite . among the cross sections neutrino interactions with @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are most relevant . in this low energy scale",
    ", the cross section varies rapidly , leading to large uncertainty in predicting the core collapse supernova  @xcite .",
    "although some theoretical calculations  @xcite of neutrino - nucleus cross sections have been performed in recent years , large uncertainties still exist and need to be clarified from experiments . on the experiment side ,",
    "the differential cross sections with @xmath4 and @xmath5 have been measured by karmen and lsnd experiments  @xcite , but those with @xmath1 and @xmath2 are still not available . in this paper , we present a simulation study on cross section measurement of neutrino interaction with fe and pb .",
    "the motivation is to give an estimate of the achievable limit in the experiment of neutrino cross section measurement with a segmented detector at spallation neutron source(sns ) .    at sns , protons are driven to hit a target , producing a large amount of neutrons and by - product pions .",
    "the negative pions are mostly captured in the target , while the positive pions , after having been stopped in the target within @xmath6 ns or so , undergo the characteristic successive decay scheme @xmath7 and followed by @xmath8 .",
    "the resultant @xmath0 s can have a flux up to @xmath9 @xmath10 at a distance of 20 meters away from the spallation target for the sns at the oak ridge national laboratory , assuming the sns power to be 1 mw  @xcite .",
    "since the time structure of sns beam provides a unique advantage for neutrino studies@xcite , backgrounds are strongly suppressed . in the sns target ,",
    "the pions are stopped and decay to muons .",
    "the subsequent muon decay produces equal intensity of @xmath0 and @xmath11 , with a maximum energy 52.8 mev .",
    "the energy spectra of the three kinds of neutrinos are shown in fig.[fig : snsneutrino ] .",
    "such an energy range overlaps extremely well with that of supernova neutrinos .",
    "this characteristics makes it valuable to measure cross sections of interactions between neutrinos and various target materials at sns .",
    "[ fig : detector ] shows the sketch of neutrino detector at sns .",
    "a @xmath12sns project@xcite was proposed to build a neutrino facility at the sns at oak ridge national laboratory . however , there is no report on how precise the measurement can be achieved .",
    "electron neutrinos interacting with target material at the sns undergo both neutral- and charged - current interactions , while muon neutrinos can only undergo neutral - current interactions due to the limitation of kinematics .",
    "the neutral - current events are suppressed by at least two orders of magnitude in comparison with the charged - current events and can only be measured by the decay of excited nucleus .",
    "the charged - current events can be detected via the outgoing electron in the neutrino - nucleus reaction @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "since the neutrino energy is much lower than the nucleus , considering the charged - current quasi - elastic(ccqe ) process and ignoring fermi motion of nucleus , the neutrino energy @xmath15 can be determined by the induced electron energy @xmath16 , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the mass difference between the final state nucleus @xmath19 and the initial state nucleus @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , a precise energy reconstruction of the @xmath0 induced electrons is essential to determine the differential cross sections .",
    "the segmented detector is proposed to measure the trajectories of @xmath0 induced electrons in the target . however , the energy lose of the electron is dominated by ionization at low energy , while above the critical energy @xmath21 , it will be dominated by bremsstrahlung .",
    "the electromagnetic shower caused by bremsstrahlung will lead to large uncertainty on the measurement of electron track length for energy above @xmath21 .",
    "the critical energy can be approximated  @xcite by @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the atomic number of the target nucleus .",
    "therefore the critical energy of @xmath1 is @xmath24 , and @xmath25 for @xmath2 .",
    "this makes it impossible to obtain the electron energy by its track length event by event . in this paper",
    ", we will show a statistical application to unfold the distorted energy spectrum , and leading to a reasonable resolution of the differential cross section .",
    "the outline of this paper is as followed . in section 2 ,",
    "the geant4 simulation of neutrino induced electrons are simulated in @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the simulation results and analysis are described in section 3 , and a brief conclusion is made in section 4 .",
    "to simplify the issue , we use a cube block target material with a fiducial volume of @xmath26 @xmath27 , in stead of the segmented detector with target , tube , wire , etc .",
    "the tracking resolution is assumed to be perfect .",
    "geant4 ( version 9.0p01 ) package  @xcite is applied in this simulation study .",
    "the cross section of neutrino - nucleus scattering is rather small , we therefore directly simulate the behaviors of the induced electron in the target .",
    "the input energy spectrum of electron is the michel distribution shaped by the theoretically predicted cross section given by r. lazauskas and c. volpe  @xcite .",
    "the maximum energy of induced electron , @xmath28 , is approximately @xmath29 mev on @xmath30 , and the threshold energy of the interaction is @xmath31 mev . for @xmath32 , @xmath33 mev , and @xmath34 mev .",
    "daughter products e.g. , @xmath35 , @xmath36 are ignored , since the life times of the daughters are long comparing the search window ( @xmath37 micro seconds ) .",
    "the material of the detector is selected to be iron or lead with natural abundances , but not pure @xmath30 or @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , the measured cross section is an average of mixture isotopes of iron or lead .",
    "this affects iron little since the natural abundance of @xmath30 is @xmath38 . for lead , the natural abundances of @xmath32 , @xmath39 and @xmath40",
    "are @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 respectively , the effect of the mixture should be considered seriously in later studies .    for the interaction of electrons in nuclear material ,",
    "electromagnetic process is the most important one .",
    "the processes of multiple scattering , low energy ionization and low energy bremsstrahlung are added for electrons in the simulation .    to perform the unfolding procedure  @xcite ,",
    "two kinds of spectra of electrons are generated : 1 ) michel distribution used to obtain the detector response matrix ; 2 ) michel distribution weighted with the cross section of corresponding @xmath0-nucleus interaction .",
    "the second one is considered as the true distribution to be reconstructed . for each event , the electron s energy ( input ) @xmath44 and track length @xmath45 in the target are recorded .",
    "the number of events attainable in one nominal year ( assuming  @xmath46 seconds ) is estimated by considering the flux of electron neutrino , the size of detector and the average cross section of @xmath0-nucleus scattering .",
    "the expected maximum cross section at @xmath47 for @xmath1 is @xmath48 , and it gives that the average cross section over energy is about @xmath49 . for @xmath2 , @xmath50 , and",
    "the average cross section over energy is about @xmath51 . assuming the effective volume of target is @xmath52 , and the flux of @xmath0 s is @xmath53 , the number of events in one nominal year is estimated to be @xmath54 for fe target , and @xmath55 for pb target .",
    "in the energy measurement , due to detector resolution , efficiency and sometimes intrinsic physical reason , the true value in bin @xmath56 , will usually migrate into measured energy bin @xmath57 .",
    "in other words , the measured distribution is usually distorted by the detector response , or the detector response is folded to the true distribution , leading to the measured distribution . in many cases ,",
    "the true distribution could be restored by applying correction factors to the measured distribution .",
    "this method fails , however , if the relation between true value and measured ones is highly nonlinear where the behavior of detector response is poor .",
    "suppose the true distribution is @xmath58 , and the measured one is @xmath59 . if effects of efficiency and background are ignored , they satisfy @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the response matrix or the migration matrix which describes the effects of detector response .",
    "the basic idea of unfolding is that the effects of detector response could be removed or unfolded by inverse of the response matrix , i.e. , the estimator of the true distribution @xmath62 is @xmath63 however , although this is the unbias estimator with smallest variance , the physics is totally swept out by unphysical oscillation .",
    "the regularization is needed to remove the unphysical oscillation , which is actually a compromise between bias and unphysical oscillation , controlled by the choice of regularization parameter .",
    "there are several different schemes of regularisation  @xcite , for example , tiknonov reularizaton , regularization based on entropy , bayesian regularization , regularization based on singular value decomposition(svd ) , etc .",
    "the basic point of all is that the true distribution is believed to be smooth but not oscillating rapidly . in this study",
    ", we used the tsvdunfold class in root package@xcite .",
    "tsvdunfold is a class in root for unfolding based on svd technique , it is part of roounfold , a root unfolding framework , developed by tim adye , _ et al _  @xcite .    in the sns neutrino experiment , to measure the differential cross section of neutrino - nucleus scattering , the true value is the energy of incident electron , which is principally unknown and supposed to be binned in histogram @xmath44 , the measured value is the electron track length in the target , binned in histogram @xmath45 .",
    "the response matrix @xmath61 can be obtained by monte carlo simulation as long as we have full knowledge on the detector . in discrete expression , @xmath64 where @xmath65 is number of events in bin @xmath56 of @xmath44 , @xmath66 is number of events in bin @xmath57 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 are numbers of bins of @xmath44 and @xmath45 respectively .",
    "the physical meaning of @xmath69 is the probability of an event in bin @xmath56 of true distribution to migrate into bin @xmath57 of measured distribution .",
    "therefore , the response matrix is actually the normalized two - dimensional scattering plot of @xmath45 and @xmath44 .",
    "in the simulation , the electron track length @xmath45 is directly read from geant4 with no uncertainty . the response matrix of detector with the iron target is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : responsem](a ) , and that of detector with the lead target is shown in fig .  [ fig : responsem](b ) , corresponding to 200,000 electrons with michel distributed energy . if the matrix were diagonal , one can easily obtain the energy of incident electron through track length event by event .",
    "however , these two plots show significant non - diagonal elements of the response matrices , and hence it is impossible to obtain directly the incident energy through track length .",
    "especially , it is obvious that the track length in iron target is smeared widely with energy above @xmath70 mev , while for lead target the smearing begins with energy above @xmath71 mev or so .",
    "this is the consequence of electromagnetic shower .",
    "both simulations are exactly consistent with the expected critical energies of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .        2 to extract the physical part out of the unphysical oscillation , the choice of regularization parameter is crucial , which reflects a trade - off between bias and oscillation . for the unfolding based on the svd technique , the choice of regularization parameter should be tuned for given distribution , number of bins and sample size . as described in ref .",
    "@xcite , the regularization parameter @xmath72 should be chosen by the plot of @xmath73 versus @xmath56 , where integer @xmath56 is from @xmath74 to the number of bins and the @xmath56th component of the vector @xmath75 is the coefficient in the decomposition of the measured ( and re - scaled ) histogram . only the first few terms , say @xmath76 , of the decomposition should be significant for a reasonably smooth measured distribution , while the others correspond to contribution of quickly oscillating basis vectors , and should be compatible with zero .",
    "therefore , one should see two separate patterns on the plot of @xmath73 : for small @xmath56 , @xmath77 is significantly greater than @xmath74 and falls gradually to a standard gaussian distribution for large @xmath56 .",
    "one should choose the regularization parameter @xmath72 to be the critical value @xmath78 , after which @xmath79 s are insignificant .",
    "[ fig : ddi](a ) shows the plot of @xmath80 versus @xmath56 with @xmath81 events accumulated in @xmath1 target , approximate data of one nominal year .",
    "the parameter @xmath82 is chosen from this plot .",
    "the unfolded energy spectrum of the @xmath0 induced electron is shown in the upper plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : unfoldede](a ) , while the lower plot shows the discrepancy between the unfolded spectrum and the true one , where the latter is michel distribution shaped by theoretical prediction of differential cross section . with the unfolded energy spectrum of the induced electron ,",
    "one can obtain the spectrum of the @xmath0 s that interact with the @xmath1 target using eq .",
    "( [ eq : energy_relation ] ) . dividing this spectrum by michel distribution",
    "gives the differential cross section of @xmath0-nucleus scattering , as shown in the upper plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : xsec](a ) . the lower plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : xsec](a ) shows the relative discrepancy between the measured cross section and the true one .",
    "one can see that the discrepancies and errors are huge for energy below @xmath83 mev , mainly because the cross section of low energy is too small and few events are collected in this range .",
    "the discrepancy of the last bin is also large , around @xmath84 . for other bins ,",
    "the discrepancies are controlled within @xmath85 .",
    "we checked this result by comparison with five other samples under the same condition .",
    "it shows that for energy below @xmath83 mev the measured cross sections fluctuate significantly , therefore totally unreliable . while the discrepancies between @xmath83 and @xmath86 mev are well controlled within @xmath85 .",
    "increasing the sample size to be @xmath87 slightly improves the behavior between @xmath83 and @xmath86 mev , but helps less(if not nothing ) to the region below @xmath83 mev .",
    "2 for @xmath2 target , the sample size is @xmath88 .",
    "[ fig : ddi](b ) shows the plot of @xmath80 versus @xmath56 , according to which , the regularization parameter @xmath89 is chosen for @xmath2 .",
    "the unfolded energy spectrum of the @xmath0 induced electron is shown in the upper plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : unfoldede](b ) , and the lower plot shows the discrepancy between the unfolded and true spectrum , where the true one is michel distribution shaped by theoretically predicted cross section of @xmath0-@xmath2 interaction .",
    "the resulting differential cross section of @xmath0-@xmath2 scattering is shown in the upper plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : xsec](b ) , and the lower plot shows the relative discrepancy between the measured differential cross section and the true one . similar to the case of @xmath1 target , one can see that the discrepancies and errors are large for energy below @xmath90 mev due to lack of events .",
    "the discrepancy of the last bin is also large , around @xmath84 . for other bins , energy between @xmath91 and @xmath86 mev ,",
    "the discrepancies are well controlled within @xmath85 .",
    "this result is compared with five other samples using the same regularization parameter .",
    "it shows that for energy below @xmath90 mev the measured cross sections fluctuate significantly , therefore totally unreliable . while the discrepancies between @xmath90 and @xmath86 mev are well controlled below @xmath85 .",
    "with monte carlo simulation , we studied the achievable accuracy for the @xmath0-nucleus scattering cross section measurement using an ideal segmented detector .",
    "two different target materials , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , are investigated , since they are most relevant to the evolution of supernova and experimental data of the cross section are still not available .",
    "the energy spectrum of the @xmath0 induced electron can be well reconstructed using the unfolding method , therefore makes it feasible for the measurement of differential cross section . for @xmath1 target",
    ", the cross sections between @xmath83 and @xmath86 mev can be measured within @xmath85 accuracy using @xmath81 events , the cross sections below @xmath83 mev is however totally unreliable since the cross section is too small in this region . for @xmath2 target , the cross sections between @xmath90 and @xmath86 mev can be measured within @xmath85 accuracy using @xmath88 events , the cross sections below @xmath90 mev are not reliable due to low statistics",
