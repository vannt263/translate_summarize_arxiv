    "we show that using present - day laboratory magnetic fields may change essentially the population of the @xmath0 sub - levels of the excited states ( @xmath10 ) of the fast muonic ions @xmath11 formating in muon catalyzed fusion ( @xmath12)[1 - 4 ] .",
    "this may affect the muon stripping and , especially , the intensities of the @xmath4-rays from the ions .",
    "stronger fields also cause the self - ionization@xcite of the highly excited states of the @xmath11 ions .",
    "both effects are consequences of the non - separability of the collective and internal degrees of freedom of the charged two - body system ( @xmath11 ) in the presence of an external magnetic field@xcite .",
    "the coupling between the center - of - mass ( cm ) and light particle ( muon ) motions is described by an oscillating stark term which is proportional to the mass ratio @xmath13 ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the muon and the @xmath16 mass respectively ) , the cm - momentum ( see below ) and the magnetic field strength @xmath17@xcite . a rather strong coupling of the cm and muon motions due to the essential non - adiabaticity ( @xmath18 ) and the high cm - velocity ( @xmath19 ) makes the system @xmath16 , formed in @xmath12 , sufficiently sensitive to the external magnetic field .",
    "thus , as it will be shown below , one can drive the sub - level populations @xmath20 of the fast @xmath16 in excited states @xmath10 by applying magnetic fields of a few @xmath2 . however , from the first glance the obtained result looks quite unexpected , because the muonic atomic unit of the magnetic field , @xmath21 , is extremely large , exceeding the existing present - day laboratory fields by nine orders of magnitude .    in section",
    "ii we describe our time - dependent approach for treating the evolution of the two - body charged system in an external magnetic field .",
    "the calculations of the transition rates between the sub - levels @xmath0 of the fast @xmath16 ion in the presence of a magnetic field are discussed in section iii .",
    "section iv is devoted to a discussion of the self - ionization process of highly excited states of the fast @xmath16 ion in a strong field .",
    "finally we provide some conclusions in section v.",
    "we start our analysis with the transformed hamiltonian@xcite of the moving @xmath16 ion in a magnetic field .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system @xmath22 consists of two terms describing the cm motion @xmath23 and internal degrees of freedom @xmath24",
    "@xmath25 \\ve{b}\\times\\ve{r})^2 -\\frac{ze^2}{r}\\ ] ] as well as the coupling term @xmath26\\ve{r}\\ ] ] between the cm and internal motions",
    ". here ( @xmath27 ) and ( @xmath28 ) are the canonical coordinate - momentum pairs for the cm and internal motions , @xmath29 is the helium nuclear mass .",
    "the magnetic field vector is denoted as @xmath30 and oriented along the @xmath31axis , the charges of the nucleus , the ion and the muon are @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively and @xmath35 .",
    "in references@xcite it was shown that for the one - electron ion @xmath36 the corrections to the cm motion due to the coupling term ( 3 ) are negligible in not too strong fields and at low cm velocities .",
    "therefore , the cm can be treated as a pseudoparticle with mass @xmath15 and unit charge ( @xmath37)@xcite , performing the cyclic motion @xmath38 with the frequency @xmath39 in the @xmath40-plane orthogonal to the vector of the magnetic field @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath41 is the projection of the initial cm velocity @xmath42 onto the @xmath40-plane . by using the classical hamiltonian equations connecting the cm momentum @xmath43 and the velocity @xmath44 of the center of mass of the @xmath36 ion in the field @xmath17@xcite",
    ", one can transform the mixing term ( 3 ) to the form @xmath45\\ve{r } \\simeq \\gamma e[\\ve{b}\\times\\dot{\\ve{r}}]\\ve{r } \\ , \\ ] ] representing an oscillating stark field ( see eq.(4 ) ) .",
    "thus we get the simplified effective hamiltonian of the electron motion @xmath46 , with @xmath47 defined by the eq.(4 ) . such an approach has , however , many limitations and in particular fails to describe correctly a number of interesting phenomena occurring in ion physics . in particular for the muonic ion @xmath16 in a magnetic field",
    "the coupling ( 3 ) between the internal and cm variables is @xmath48 times stronger compared to the electronic counterpart @xmath49 , what demands an accurate treatment of the non - separability of the system .    for analyzing the time - evolution of the fast @xmath16 ions in a magnetic field we suggest an approach including the non - adiabatic effects in the problem ( all the terms of the order @xmath13 and @xmath50 in eqs.(1)-(3 ) ) .",
    "it is a mixed treatment by a coupled system of equations describing quantum mechanically the muon degrees of freedom and treating classically the cm motion .",
    "it is formulated as the initial - value problem @xmath51 @xmath52 with the effective hamiltonian @xmath53 ^ 2\\ ] ] @xmath54\\ve{r } \\ , \\ ] ] depending on the parameters @xmath55 and @xmath56 defined by the classical hamiltonian equations of motion @xmath57 ( here @xmath58 are the coulomb wave functions of the bound muon in @xmath16 without external field , @xmath59 is the muon angular momentum , @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) where the hamiltonian @xmath62 is determined as @xmath63 by averaging the initial hamiltonian ( 1 - 3 ) over the internal variables @xmath64 at every time moment and simultaneously integration of the coupled eqs.(6 - 9 ) . here and",
    "below we use @xmath65 .",
    "the cm coordinate @xmath66 is separated and two pairs of the classical hamiltonian equations of motion @xmath67 coupled also with the schrdinger equation(6 ) via the terms @xmath68 and @xmath69 need to be integrated .",
    "such an approach is analogous to the ones given in refs.[11 - 13 ] suggested for semiclassically treating the dynamics of molecular processes@xcite .",
    "it has the property of conserving the total energy of the system @xmath16 and includes the coupling between the cm and internal variables , which is important for the problem of a fast muonic ion in a magnetic field due to the essential non - adiabaticity of the system ( @xmath70 ) and high cm - velocity ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "the time - dependent three - dimensional schrdinger equation ( 6 ) is integrated by the method developed in refs.[14 - 16 ] simultaneously with the system of coupled hamiltonian equations of motion(10 ) .    in principle one can think also of a time - dependent perturbation theoretical approach in order to describe the sublevel mixing induced by the oscillating motional electric field .",
    "however , the large center of mass velocity together with the strong non - adiabaticity in the case of our muonic helium would certainly require a very careful estimate of the possible range of validity of such an approach . for small center of mass velocities of the `` electronic '' @xmath49-ion",
    "a perturbation theoretical approach for the classical dynamics of the ion has been developed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the fast ions @xmath16 are formated in @xmath12 due to the muon `` sticking '' process to helium @xmath72 partly in excited states @xmath10 with the kinetic energy @xmath73[1 - 4,14 ] . at the present time",
    "the effect is rather well investigated both experimentally and theoretically due to its importance for the efficiency of @xmath12 in deuterium - tritium mixture@xcite .",
    "particularly an essential dependence of the muon `` stripping '' from the @xmath16 ions ( characterized by the reactivation rate @xmath74@xcite ) on the population @xmath20 of its excited states ( @xmath75)[18 - 21 ] was found .",
    "here we analyze this parameter in the presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "we have calculated the time evolution of the population @xmath76 of the sub - levels @xmath77 for states @xmath78 and @xmath79 of @xmath16 for the present - day laboratory fields @xmath17 with strengths of a few @xmath2 .",
    "the maximal value @xmath80 of the @xmath16 ion cm velocity projection onto the @xmath40-plane , perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field @xmath30 , is chosen to coincide with the initial velocity of the ion , @xmath81 ( @xmath73 ) , formating in reaction ( 11 ) .    the coupled schrdinger equation ( 6 ) and classical equations ( 10 ) with the initial conditions @xmath82 were integrated simultaneously with the same step of integration @xmath83 over time @xmath84 .",
    "details of the computational scheme applied for the integration of the schrdinger equation ( 6 ) can be found in refs.@xcite .",
    "the grids over @xmath85 $ ] ( 250 grid points ) and the angular variables @xmath86 ( 25 grid points ) were constructed according to ref.@xcite .",
    "the step of integration over @xmath84 was chosen as @xmath87 , what permitted to keep the accuracy of the evaluated quantities ( 12 ) about a few percents after @xmath88 steps of integration . here and below some values",
    "are given in muonic atomic units of @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "results of the calculation are presented in figs.1 and 2 .",
    "we have analyzed two cases : the muon is initially in the @xmath91 or @xmath92 states of @xmath16 , i.e. the quantum numbers @xmath93 were fixed as @xmath94 or @xmath95 in eqs.(13 ) .",
    "the obtained data demonstrate that applying the magnetic fields of the order of a few @xmath2 stimulates fast transitions between the @xmath0 sub - levels in excited states ( @xmath10 ) of the @xmath11 ions moving with the velocities defined by the energy output in the fusion reaction ( 11 ) .",
    "these transitions occur through energy transfer from the cm to the internal muon motion and become faster with increasing field strength @xmath17 or the @xmath41 component of the initial cm velocity @xmath96 ( see figs.2 ) in agreement with the classical equations @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 are the energy of the center of mass and internal motion@xcite respectively .",
    "this equation is the consequence of the classical hamiltonian equations of motion of the two - body charged system in a magnetic field@xcite and shows a permanent exchange of energy between the cm and muonic degrees of freedom .",
    "the above results were obtained in the nonrelativistic limit for which the splitting between different @xmath0 states is given exclusively by the interaction of the muonic atom with the magnetic field . however due to its compactness the muonic helium has considerable relativistic corrections which could in principle suppress the above - calculated transition rates .",
    "the measured @xmath100 splitting is @xmath101 @xcite .",
    "the main contribution in the @xmath102 splitting is given by the vacuum polarization ( vp ) effect @xmath103 @xcite , which is dominant among other relativistic and short - range corrections in the muonic helium @xcite .",
    "muonic ions ( atoms ) are much more sensitive than electronic ones to the vp alteration of the coulomb interaction , because the dimension of the muonic ion @xmath104 is close to the compton electron wavelength @xmath105 .    to evaluate the influence of the main relativistic effect on the magnetic field stimulated @xmath5 transitions we have integrated the eqs.(6)-(10 ) with the additional vp potential @xmath106 including in the hamiltonian ( 7 ) an effective interaction between the muon and helium nucleus due to the virtual production of a single @xmath107 pair .",
    "the results presented in fig.3 demonstrate that the slowing down of the @xmath91 state depopulation due to the relativistic @xmath5 splitting becomes considerable for times of the order @xmath108 for the chosen parameters of @xmath17 and @xmath41 .",
    "the calculated rates of the @xmath5 and @xmath109 mixing exceed , at least by two order of magnitude , the rates of the resonance muonic molecule formation ( @xmath110)[1 - 4 ] and are comparable with other transition rates of the @xmath1 in the process of the deceleration in a dense deuterium - tritium mixture ( transitions due to inelastic collisions , auger transitions , stark mixing@xcite ) . transitions between different @xmath111 , stimulated by the driven field of the order of a few @xmath2 , are much slower then sub - level transitions with the same @xmath111 .",
    "thus , for low density with suppression of the collisional transitions such that only the radiative transitions @xmath112 between some known states are remained essential@xcite , one can drive the sub - levels population @xmath113 by varying the strength of the applied magnetic field .",
    "different modelling of the @xmath16 ion time - evolution in @xmath114 mixture show the strong dependence of the muonic ions @xmath4-ray yield from the @xmath5 population ( especially for @xmath115 radiation ) .",
    "some estimations show also an influence of these populations on the reactivation rate @xmath74@xcite .",
    "both parameters , reactivation rate r and @xmath115 lines intensity , are under extensive experimental investigation so far@xcite .",
    "thus , the experimental achievement in @xmath12 makes it possible to analyze directly the influence of the driving magnetic field to the @xmath115 @xmath116 ray production and the reactivation rates @xmath74 by measuring these parameters at low densities in the presence of external magnetic fields . the possibility to create a well - defined mixing of the @xmath77 sub - levels in such kind of experiments looks especially valuable , because different hypothesis about the @xmath5 mixing have been used so far in modelling the @xmath16 time - evolution@xcite due to a considerable variation for the estimates of the @xmath5 stark mixing by different authors@xcite,[25 - 27 ] .",
    "in refs.@xcite the self - ionization process for ions in the presence of an external magnetic field has been predicted and demonstrated by solving the classical equations of motion for rydberg states of the one - electron @xmath49 ion .",
    "here we discuss briefly the possibility to ionize the fast highly - excited @xmath16 ion by a strong magnetic field .",
    "actually , the muon kinetic energy in the direction of the magnetic field @xmath30 can become large enough in order to ionize the system through the energy transfer from the cm to the internal motion according to eq.(14 ) .",
    "perpendicular to the magnetic field the muonic motion is finite because of the confining property of the magnetic field .",
    "this is a principal difference of the self - ionization in the presence of a magnetic field compared to the classical ionization by an external electric field .    in the present calculations ( the initial population is chosen to be @xmath117 , i.e. the @xmath118 state ) we used a more detailed grid over @xmath119 $ ] ( 400 grid points ) as compared to the calculations for the low - lying states @xmath120 .",
    "the boundary @xmath121 was chosen approximately 10 times exceeding the initial value of the mean radius @xmath122 of the @xmath1 ion in the @xmath118 state . following the refs.@xcite we have used an absorbing boundary condition at the point @xmath123 .",
    "it permits to prevent the artificial reflection of the muon flux from the grid boundary as well as allows an estimation of the ionization rate by analyzing the decay of the muon norm @xmath124 with time@xcite .",
    "the calculated time - evolution of the muon densities in @xmath125-direction of @xmath30 and the perpendicular direction are presented in figs.4 for the strong field @xmath126 .",
    "they demonstrate considerable spreading of the muon density in @xmath125-direction for @xmath127 .",
    "the evaluated norm @xmath128 ( fig.5 ) gives the following estimate @xmath129 for the order of the self - ionization time .",
    "this shows that the self - ionization is at least one order of magnitude faster than the process of the muonic molecule resonant formation ( @xmath130[1 - 4 ] ) and potentially may be useful for increasing the muon stripping from the highly - excited states ( @xmath131 ) of the @xmath132 ions .",
    "however , it is at the time being not clear how to make this process efficient with respect to the increase of the reactivation rate r. actually , the @xmath132 ions are formed in reaction ( 11 ) mainly in low - lying excited states ( only a few percents of the muonic ions are in @xmath133[1 - 4 ] ) for which the self - ionization is much slower .",
    "our estimates , made for the same field strength @xmath126 show a fast increase of the self - ionization time with decreasing @xmath111 . particularly , for @xmath134 the self - ionization time already exceeds the critical value @xmath135 defined by the resonant muonic molecule formation . in principle",
    "it may be compensated by increasing the strength of the applied field to @xmath136 , which is , however , orders of magnitude beyond the currently available fields at high magnetic field facilities@xcite .",
    "the so far kown mechanisms@xcite also do not permit an efficient excitation of the fast muonic ions .",
    "in this work we analyzed the transitions stimulated by external magnetic fields from excited states of the fast @xmath16 ions .",
    "the results have been obtained within an approach developed for treating non - adiabatic two - body charged system in external magnetic fields on a mixed quantum - semiclassical level .",
    "it was shown that the present - day laboratory fields of the order of a few @xmath2 may stimulate strong @xmath5 mixing as well as @xmath77 mixing of the sub - levels for @xmath137 in the @xmath16 ions formating in @xmath12 .",
    "the effect of the magnetic field stimulating the @xmath5 transitions can be analyzed experimentally by measuring the dependence of the intensities of the @xmath115-lines from the @xmath16 on the field strength .",
    "it is also interesting to analyze experimentally the influence of this effect on another important @xmath12 parameter , the reactivation rate @xmath74 , due to the possible dependence of the value @xmath74 on the @xmath5 mixing in @xmath138@xcite .",
