    "the einstein theory of gravity has been a pioneering tool for understanding and describing the gravitational systems .",
    "most of the results and validations of this theory have been confirmed by observations done on solar system level .",
    "in addition , the observations of ligo collaboration proved the existence of gravitational wave which was one of the challenging predictions of gr @xcite .",
    "it is expected to observe the advantages of gr for beyond the newtonian theory regimes ( high curvature regimes ) such as near the compact objects .",
    "the existence of compact objects has been confirmed in the einstein theory . due to the physical properties of these objects ,",
    "it is necessary to take the curvature of spacetime into account in order to have reliable predictions .",
    "therefore , we employ the einstein theory of gravity to study the neutron star .    as we mentioned , the einstein theory predicts the existence of massless spin-@xmath3 gravitons with two degrees of freedom as intermediate particles for signaling the gravitational interactions .",
    "but , there have been several arguments regarding the possibility of existence of massive gravitons .",
    "these arguments are supported by studies that are conducted on quantum level of gravity and brane - world gravity .",
    "especially problems such as the hierarchy problem and their brane - world gravity solutions have expressed on the possibility of existence of massive spin-@xmath3 gravitons dvaligp , dvaligpi .",
    "therefore , it is natural to relax massless constraint and consider the modifications and generalizations of the general relativity to include massive graviton . in this paper , we generalize the einstein theory of gravity to include the massive graviton and investigate its effects on the hydrostatic equilibrium equation of a typical neutron star .    the first attempt for building massive gravity",
    "was done by fierz and pauli @xcite .",
    "this theory has the specific problem known as vdvz ( van dam - veltman - zakharov ) discontinuity which indicates that the propagators of massless and massive in the limit of @xmath4 , are not the same van dam , zakharov , deserw .",
    "the resolution to this problem was vainshtein mechanism which requires the system to be considered in nonlinear framework @xcite .",
    "such generalization to nonlinear case introduces a ghost into the theory which is known as boulware - deser ghost @xcite .",
    "there are various ghost free scenarios for considering the massive gravity in the nonlinear framework .",
    "one of the interesting ghost free theories of massive gravity is known as drgt theory which was developed by de rham , gabadadze and tolley @xcite . in this theory , a reference metric",
    "is employed to build massive terms @xcite .",
    "these massive terms are inserted in the action to provide massive gravitons .",
    "cosmological results , black hole solutions and thermodynamical properties of this massive gravity are investigated by many authors fasiello , bambahmns , cais , goongh , heisenbergky , solomonea , panc , kodamaa , babichevf , babichevb , sureshmp , lilx .",
    "in addition , katsuragawa et al , studied the neutron star in the context of drgt theory and showed that , the massive gravity leads to small deviation from the gr @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that the reference metric plays a key role for constructing the massive theory of gravity @xcite .",
    "one of the modifications in reference metric was done by vegh which introduced a new massive gravity @xcite .",
    "this new massive theory has specific applications in the gauge / gravity duality especially in lattice physics which motivate one to use it in other frameworks as well .",
    "this theory was employed in the context of black holes and it was shown that geometrical and thermodynamical structures of the black holes will be modified and new phenomena were reported for massive black holes caihpz , hendiepjhep2015,xuch , ghoshtw , hendipejhep , hendiepjhep2016,sureshk . here , we use this massive theory to conduct our studies in the properties of neutron star .",
    "the structure of stars and their phenomenological properties are described with hydrostatic equilibrium equation ( hee ) .",
    "this equation is based on the fact that a typical star will be in equilibrium when there is a balance between the internal pressure and the gravitational force .",
    "historically speaking , the first hee equation for gr was introduced and employed by tolman , oppenheimer and volkoff ( tov ) @xcite .",
    "after that , a series of studies were dedicated to obtain hee of neutron star @xcite .",
    "in addition , the compact objects and their tov equations were investigated in the presence of different modified gravities such as ; gravity s rainbow @xcite , dilaton gravity @xcite , and @xmath5 and @xmath6 gravities @xcite ( see harada , wiseman , sotani , delidumanek , donevaysk , chamelhzf , barausseppl , silvasbh , brihayer , dasrgr , staykovdyk , boyadjiev , meyer , orellanagpr , arbanillz , goswaminmg , glampedakispsb , greens , candelashsw for more details ) .    according to recent studies on neutron stars and observations of the interesting properties of these stars sigurdsson , vietri , heger , rea , perna , katayama , clausen , hebeler , perez , deaton , dallosso , venumadhav , poutanen , east , zheng , mastrano , giacomazz , gelfand , wielgus , ruiz , we want to investigate these stars in the context of massive gravity .",
    "in other words , our main motivation in this paper is studying the effects of considering the massive gravity on the structure of neutron star .",
    "previous studies in the context of other astrophysical objects have proven a wide variation in the properties of these objects comparing to the massless graviton case .",
    "therefore , we are expecting to see the specific modifications in the properties of neutron star as well . here",
    ", we would like to address how the structure of neutron star will be modified in the presence of massive gravity and which contributions this generalization has into properties of these objects .",
    "we regard the hee equation in @xmath1 and higher dimensions with a suitable equation of state ( eos ) , which satisfies stability , energy conditions and le chatelier s principle .",
    "we obtain the maximum mass and corresponding radius , schwarzschild radius , compactness , gravitational redshift and dynamical stability of neutron star .",
    "we give details regarding the effects of massive gravity on these properties .",
    "studies which are conducted in this paper provide an insight into the structure of neutron star and enable one to make a comparison between the massive and massless gravities . remembering that the neutron star , similar to other massive objects , propagate gravitation waves , one is urged to study the neutron star in the presence of massive gravity which is the aim of this paper .",
