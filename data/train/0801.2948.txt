    "a fundamental question in statistical physics is whether the structure of ordinary equilibrium statistical mechanics falters when its fundamental properties , phase - space mixing and ergodicity , breakdown .",
    "the chaotic dynamics displayed by dissipative nonlinear systems , even those of low dimensionality , possesses these two crucial conditions , and acts in accordance with a formal structure analogous to that of canonical statistical mechanics , in which thermodynamic concepts meet their dynamical counterparts @xcite . at the transition between chaotic and regular behavior , classically represented by the feigenbaum attractor @xcite",
    ", the lyapunov exponent vanishes and chaotic dynamics turns critical .",
    "trajectories cease to be ergodic and mixing ; they retain memory of their initial positions and fluctuate according to complex deterministic patterns @xcite . under these conditions",
    "it is of interest to check up whether the statistical - mechanical structure subsists , and if so , examine if it is unchanged or if it has acquired a new form .    with this purpose in mind ,",
    "the exploration of possible limits of validity of the canonical statistical mechanics , an ideal model system is a one - dimensional map at the transition between chaotic and regular behavior , represented by well - known critical attractors , such as the feigenbaum attractor .",
    "so far , recent studies @xcite have concentrated on the dynamics _ inside _ the attractor and have revealed that these trajectories obey remarkably rich scaling properties not known previously at this level of detail @xcite .",
    "the results are exact and clarify robledo2 the relationship between the original modification @xcite of the thermodynamic approach to chaotic attractors @xcite for this type of incipiently chaotic attractor , and some aspects of the @xmath0-deformed statistical mechanical formalism @xcite .",
    "the complementary part of the dynamics , that of advance _ on the way _ to the attractor , has , to our knowledge , not been analyzed , nor understood , with a similar degree of thoroughness .",
    "the process of convergence of trajectories into the feigenbaum attractor poses several interesting questions that we attempt to answer here and elsewhere @xcite based on the comprehensive knowledge presented below .",
    "prominent amongst these questions is the nature of the connection between the two sets of dynamical properties , within and outside the attractor .",
    "as it turns out , these two sets of properties are related to each other in a statistical - mechanical manner , i.e. the dynamics _ at _ the attractor provides the configurations in a partition function while the _ approach _ to the attractor is described by an entropy obtained from it .",
    "as we show below , this statistical - mechanical property conforms to a @xmath0-deformation @xcite of the ordinary exponential weight statistics .",
    "trajectories inside the attractor visit positions forming oscillating log - periodic patterns of ever increasing amplitude .",
    "however , when the trajectories are observed only at specified times , positions align according to power laws , or @xmath0-exponential functions that share the same @xmath0-index value @xcite .",
    "further , all such sequences of positions can be shifted and seen to collapse into a single one by a rescaling operation similar to that observed for correlations in glassy dynamics , a property known as `` aging '' @xcite .",
    "the structure found in the dynamics is also seen to consist of a family of mori s @xmath0-phase transitions @xcite , via which the connection is made between the modified thermodynamic approach and the @xmath0-statistical property of the sensitivity to initial conditions @xcite . on the other hand , a foretaste of the nature of the dynamics outside the critical attractor can be appreciated by considering the dynamics towards the so - called superstable cycles , or supercycles , the family of periodic attractors with lyapunov exponents that diverge towards minus infinity .",
    "this infinite family of attractors has as accumulation point the transition to chaos , which for the period - doubling route is the feigenbaum attractor . as described below , the basins of attraction for the different positions of the cycles develop fractal boundaries of increasing complexity as the period - doubling structure advances towards the transition to chaos .",
    "the fractal boundaries , formed by the preimages of the repellor , display hierarchical structures organized according to exponential clusterings that manifest in the dynamics as sensitivity to the final state and transient chaos .",
    "the hierarchical arrangement expands as the period of the supercycle increases .    to observe the general procedure followed by trajectories to reach the attractors , and their complementary repellors",
    ", we consider an ensemble of uniformly distributed initial conditions @xmath1 spanning the entire phase space interval .",
    "we find that this is a highly structured process encoded in sequences of positions shared by as many trajectories with different @xmath1 .",
    "clearly , there is always a natural dynamical ordering in the @xmath1 as any trajectory of length @xmath2 contains consecutive positions of other trajectories of lengths @xmath3 , @xmath4 , etc . with initial conditions @xmath5 , @xmath6 , etc",
    "that are images under repeated map iterations of @xmath1 . in the case of the feigenbaum attractor the initial conditions form two sets , dense in each other , of preimages of each the attractor and the repellor .",
    "there is an infinite - level structure within these sets that , as we shall see , is reflected by the infinite number of families of phase - space gaps that complement the multifractal layout of both attractor and repellor .",
    "these families of gaps appear sequentially in the dynamics , beginning with the largest and followed by other sets consisting of continually increasing elements with decreasing widths .",
    "the number of gaps in each set of comparable widths increases as @xmath7 , @xmath8 and their widths can be ordered according to power laws of the form @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is feigenbaum s universal constant @xmath11 .",
    "we call @xmath12 the order of the gap set . furthermore , by considering a fine partition of phase - space , we determine the overall rate of approach of trajectories towards the attractor ( and to the repellor ) .",
    "this rate is measured by the fraction of bins @xmath13 still occupied by trajectories at time @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the power law with log - periodic modulation displayed by @xmath13 @xcite is explained in terms of the progression of gap formation , and its self - similar features are seen to originate in the unlimited hierarchy feature of the preimage structure .    before proceeding to give details in the following sections of the aforementioned dynamics , we recall basic features of the bifurcation forks that form the period - doubling cascade sequence in unimodal maps , epitomized by the logistic map @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the superstable periodic orbits of lengths @xmath17 , @xmath18 , are located along the bifurcation forks , i.e. the control parameter value @xmath19 for the superstable @xmath17-attractor is that for which the orbit of period @xmath20 contains the point @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the value of @xmath23 at the period - doubling accumulation point .",
    "the positions ( or phases ) of the @xmath17-attractor are given by @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",

    "we find it useful to order the repellor positions , or simply , repellors , present at @xmath41 , according to a hierarchy or tree , the `` oldest '' with @xmath36 up to the most `` recent '' ones with @xmath39 .",

    "we find that the paths taken by the full set of trajectories in their way to the supercycle attractors ( or to their complementary repellors ) are far from unstructured .",
    "the preimages of the attractor of period @xmath17 , @xmath18 are distributed into different basins of attraction , one for each of the @xmath17  phases ( positions ) that compose the  cycle . when @xmath69 these basins are separated by fractal boundaries",
    "whose complexity increases with increasing @xmath70 .",

    "the dynamics associated with families of trajectories always displays a distinctively concerted order that reflects the repellor preimage boundary structure of the basins of attraction .",
    "that is , each trajectory has an initial condition that is identified as an attractor ( or repellor ) preimage of a given order , and this trajectory necessarily follows the steps of other trajectories with initial conditions of lower preimage order belonging to a given chain or pathway to the attractor ( or repellor ) .",
    "this feature gives rise to transient chaotic behavior different from that observed at the last stage of approach to the attractor .",
    "when the period @xmath17 of the cycle increases the dynamics becomes more involved with increasingly more complex stages that reflect the preimage hierarchical structure . as a final point , shown in the appendix , in the closing part of the last leg of the trajectories an ultra - rapid convergence to the attractor",

    "we find that there is a functional composition renormalization group ( rg ) fixed - point map associated with the supercycle attractor , and this can be expressed in closed form by the same kind of @xmath0 -exponential function found for both the pitchfork and tangent bifurcation attractors @xcite , like that originally derived by hu and rudnick for the latter case @xcite .",

    "the set of trajectories produces an ordered flow towards the attractor or towards the repellor that reflects the ladder structure of the sub - basins that constitute the mentioned boundaries .",
    "as @xmath17 increases there is sensitivity to the final position for almost all @xmath1 , and there is a transient exponentially - increasing sensitivity to initial conditions for almost all @xmath161 .",
    "we observed that transient chaos is the manifestation of the trajectories controlled flow out of the fractal boundaries , which suggests that for large @xmath17 the flow becomes an approximately self - similar sequence of stages . as a final point , in the appendix",
    ", we look at the closing segment of trajectories at which a very fast convergence to the attractor positions occurs .",
    "we found `` universality class '' features , as the trajectories and sensitivity to initial conditions are replicated by a rg fixed - point map obtained under functional composition and rescaling .",
    "this map has the same @xmath0-deformed exponential closed form found to hold also for the pitchfork and tangent bifurcations of unimodal maps @xcite .",
    "subsequently , we examined the process followed by an ensemble of uniformly distributed initial conditions @xmath1 across the phase - space to arrive at the feigenbaum attractor , or get captured by its corresponding repellor .",
    "significantly , we gained understanding concerning the dynamical ordering in @xmath1 , in relation to the construction of the families of phase - space gaps that support the attractor and repellor , and about the rate of approach of trajectories towards these multifractal sets , as measured by the fraction of bins @xmath13 still occupied by trajectories at time @xmath2 .",
    "an important factor in obtaining this knowledge has been the consideration of the equivalent dynamical properties for the supercycles of small periods in the bifurcation cascade . as we have seen , a doubling of the period introduces well - defined additional elements in the hierarchy of the preimage structure , in the family of phase - space gaps , and in the log - periodic power law decay of the rate @xmath13 .",
    "we have then corroborated the wide - ranging correlation between time evolution at @xmath27 from @xmath56 up to @xmath57 with the static period - doubling cascade progression from @xmath58 up to @xmath27 . as a result of this",
    "we have acquired an objective insight into the complex dynamical phenomena that fix the decay  rate @xmath13 .",
    "we have clarified the genuine mechanism by means of which the discrete scale invariance implied by the log - periodic property in @xmath13 arises , that is , we have seen how its self - similarity originates in the infinite hierarchy formed by the preimage structure of the attractor and repellor .",
    "the rate @xmath13 can be obtained quantitatively [ see eq .",
    "( [ partition1 ] ) ] from the supercycle diameters @xmath48 .",
    "these basic data descriptive of the period - doubling route to chaos are also a sufficient ingredient in the determination of the anomalous sensitivity to initial conditions for the dynamics inside the feigenbaum attractor @xcite .",
    "finally , the case is made that there is a statistical - mechanical property underlying the dynamics of an ensemble of trajectories en route to the feigenbaum attractor ( and repellor ) .",
    "( [ partition1 ] ) is identified as a partition function built of @xmath0-exponential weighted configurations , and in turn , the fraction @xmath288 of phase - space still occupied at time @xmath368 is seen to have the form of the @xmath0-exponential of a thermodynamic potential function .",
    "this is argued to be a concrete , clear and genuine manifestation of @xmath0-deformation of ordinary statistical mechanics where arguments can be made explicit and rigorous .",
    "there is a close resemblance with the thermodynamic formalism for multifractal sets , but it should be stressed that the deviation from the usual exponential statistics is dynamical in origin , and due to the vanishing of the ( only ) lyapunov exponent .",
