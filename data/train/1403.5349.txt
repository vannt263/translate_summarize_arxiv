    "the introduction of large arrays to @xmath0 detection systems for nuclear spectroscopy was primarily aimed at coping with heavy - ion induced reactions , which may produce cascades of @xmath0 rays containing multiple transitions .",

    "its ability to measure high - multiplicity events with high detection efficiency enabled the identification of states with higher spins compared to earlier studies that used conventional setups .",
    "one direction of development was toward higher energy - resolution arrays by utilizing germanium ( ge ) detectors  @xcite .",
    "gammasphere  @xcite and euroball  @xcite are examples of large - scale arrays used in various spectroscopic experiments .",
    "recent developments along this line are ge tracking arrays such as greta  @xcite and agata  @xcite .",
    "another direction is toward higher efficiency measurements .",
    "the baf@xmath5-crystal array was developed for astrophysical ( n,@xmath0 ) studies at karlsruhe  @xcite .",
    "another example caesar based on csi(na ) scintillators is optimized for high @xmath0-ray detection efficiency in in - beam @xmath0-ray spectroscopy experiments at the national superconducting cyclotron laboratory at michigan state university  @xcite . for low - energy radioactive - beam experiments ,",
    "the miniball spectrometer using ge detectors has been operational at rex - isolde at cern  @xcite .",
    "the recent development of fast radioactive ion beams requires a new type of @xmath0-ray detector array for in - beam spectroscopic studies .",
    "since experiments with such beams are performed in inverse kinematics where the @xmath0-ray emitter has high velocity , typically in the range @xmath6 0.3 to 0.6 , causing a large doppler shift , @xmath0-ray measurements require information on the direction of the radiation to extract the transition energy in the rest frame of the projectile .",
    "high efficiency is another requirement , since the secondary - beam intensity for nuclei far from stability is typically low .",
    "the caesar mentioned above is one of the arrays for such fast - beam applications . the riken radioactive isotope beam factory ( ribf )  @xcite provides unique opportunities to research unstable nuclei owing to the production of the world s highest intensity exotic beams available today . to fully exploit the performance of the facility , we have built a new @xmath0-ray detector array called dali2 .",
    "it consists of 186 nai(tl ) crystals in its standard configuration , and has a reasonably good angular resolution and a high detection efficiency .",
    "the design of dali2 follows a similar concept to the original array dali ( detector array for low intensity radiation )  @xcite , which was developed for experiments at the old facility at riken that provides light exotic beams with @xmath7 .",
    "dali has been successfully employed , owing to its versatility with respect to detector configuration and its reasonably good angular and energy resolutions , in various in - beam @xmath0-ray spectroscopy measurements  @xcite ( see table  [ explist1 ] ) . however , for higher - velocity beams , the performance of dali is not optimized .",
    "dali2 was designed to meet the criteria for the new ribf facility , where the ri - beam velocity is typically 60% of the light speed , by improving the angular resolution and the detection efficiency .",
    "dali2 was completed in 2002 , and was used in a variety of experiments at the old riken facility and more recently at the new facility .",
    "gamma - transitions associated with direct reactions including coulomb excitation , proton and alpha inelastic scattering , secondary fragmentation , and nucleon transfer reactions  @xcite have been studied ( see table  [ explist2 ] ) .",
    "this article focuses on the design and performance of dali2 .",
    "features of dali2 in its early stage are briefly reported in ref .",
    "the center - of - mass energy resolution for @xmath0 rays emitted from moving sources depends on the uncertainty in the measurements of the angle of emission together with the velocity spread of the projectile and the intrinsic energy - resolution of the detector , which will be discussed in detail in sect .",
    "[ performance ] .",
    "we adopted nai(tl ) scintillator as the material for the detector crystal , since it offers a good compromise between intrinsic resolution , detection efficiency and costs .",
    "the angle measurement is made by employing a large number of ( @xmath8 depending on the experimental condition ) detectors at various distances from the target .",
    "the angle of @xmath0-ray emission is also useful to characterize the @xmath0 transition , because the @xmath0-ray angular distribution is sensitive to the transition multipolarity ( @xmath9 ) , reflecting the nuclear spin - alignment produced during the reaction process that creates the nuclei being studied .",
    "the array should cover a wide range of angles , to be sensitive to @xmath9 and , more importantly , to reduce the uncertainty in extracting the total @xmath0 emission yield .",
    "especially , small - angle measurements are important , because the @xmath0-ray angular distribution is forward peaked in the laboratory frame due to the lorentz boost .",
    "dali2 can measure @xmath0 rays from 15@xmath2 to enable to cover forward - peaked @xmath0-ray angular distribution for @xmath0 emitters with the velocities around @xmath10 at the new ribf facility .",
    "figure  [ figure1 ] shows an illustration of dali2 in its standard configuration that can accommodate 186 nai(tl ) detectors .",
    "fast beams of unstable nuclei hit the target in a vacuum pipe , and dali2 measures @xmath0 rays from ejectiles produced in excited states , for example , by inelastic scattering , in coincidence with the ejectiles that are identified by a device such as the zerodegree spectrometer  @xcite .",
    "dali2 is composed of three types of nai(tl ) scintillator crystals .",
    "the first two types of crystals , which are manufactured by saint - gobain  @xcite and scionix  @xcite , have dimensions of @xmath11 mm@xmath12 and @xmath13 mm@xmath12 , respectively . the third type of detector measures @xmath14 mm@xmath12 , and was fabricated originally for dali by bicron  @xcite .",
    "the crystals of the former two types are coupled to 38-mm@xmath15 hamamatsu  @xcite r580 photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) , whereas the bicron crystals use 50-mm@xmath15 hamamatsu r1306 pmts .",
    "each crystal is encapsulated in a 1-mm - thick aluminum housing .",
    "the typical energy resolution is about 9% ( fwhm ) for photons at 662 kev ( @xmath16cs standard source ) .     and 11@xmath17 layers at 54 and 46 degrees , respectively .",

    "[ figure1 ] , the detectors are arranged to form twelve layers set perpendicularly to the beam axis and a detector matrix covers the forward angles .",
    "each layer consists of 6 - 14 detectors , which are mounted on a 5-mm - thick aluminum plate fixed to a support structure . for the 2@xmath18 to 11@xmath17 layers ,",
    "the two neighboring layers are attached to a single plate as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] ( top ) .",
    "the last plate , for the most forward angles , fixes the forward - angle matrix consisting of 64 crystals as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] ( bottom ) .",
    "the entire setup covers a range of polar angles in the laboratory frame between 15@xmath2 and 160@xmath2 .",
    "for the layers near 90@xmath2 , the distance between the target and the center of each detector is about 30 cm , which is shortest among the detectors in different layers . in this standard dali2 configuration , the opening angle spanned by a nai(tl )",
    "crystal is approximately 6@xmath2 ( fwhm ) for detectors at 60@xmath2 to the beam line , where the doppler - shift effect is largest for ejectiles with @xmath10 .    for maintenance purposes ,",
    "each layer is subdivided into two parts , and each part can be moved from its regular position",
    ". the geometrical configuration of the crystals ( or detectors ) can be easily changed according to experimental requirements either by relocating detectors on the plates or by changing the layout of the plates .",
    "this flexibility also enables different types of experiments , to be performed , such as life - time measurements using the recoil shadow method  @xcite .      a typical diagram for signal handling for dali2 is shown in fig .  [ figure3 ] .",
    "a multichannel power supply system ( caen  @xcite sy1527 ) provides a high voltage of around 1200 v to each pmt .",
    "the signals from each pmt are fed into a shaping amplifier ( caen n568b ) and split into two separate signals for energy and timing measurements .",
    "the signals for the energy measurements , outputs of n568b shaped with 3-@xmath19s time constant , are delivered to a peak - sensing analog - to - digital converter ( caen v785 adc ) .",
    "fast - out signals differentially shaped with 100-ns time constant are fed into a time - to - digital converter ( caen v1190a tdc ) through a constant - fraction discriminator ( caen v812 cfd ) . to trigger the data acquisition , a logic signal ( @xmath0 trigger )",
    "is generated by taking the `` or '' logic of the cfd outputs .",
    "this signal is also used as a gate signal for the adc with 4 @xmath19s width and a trigger signal for the tdc .",
    "the v1190a tdc module has an adjustable time window with a time offset relative to the trigger signal , which are programmable via a vme control bus . in most of the experiments ,",
    "the width of time window and the offset are set to 2 @xmath19s and @xmath201 @xmath19s , which enable to measure the @xmath0-ray timing relative to the trigger signal , arrived about 1 @xmath19s later .",
    "thus , additional delays are not necessary for signals from cfds .",
    "data acquisition is performed by the system developed for experiments at ribf  @xcite . for in - beam @xmath0-ray spectroscopy experiments ,",
    "the entire acquisition system is triggered by a coincidence signal generated by the `` and '' logic of the @xmath0-ray and beam triggers .",
    "a typical trigger rate is around 1 khz and the dead time of the data acquisition is lower than 100 @xmath19s .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the resolution for the @xmath0-transition energy is affected by the doppler effect in addition to the intrinsic resolution of the detector .",
    "experimental conditions such as target thicknesses , beam velocities , or beam directions also influence the energy resolution as described below .",
    "the energy in the laboratory frame of reference , @xmath21 , of @xmath0 rays emitted from fast - moving nuclei is shifted from the @xmath0-ray energy in the center - of - mass ( cm ) frame , @xmath22 , i.e. , the transition energy in the nucleus of interest .",
    "these energies are related as , @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath0 denote respectively the @xmath0-ray emission angle with respect to the direction of the moving nucleus , the velocity relative to the light speed ( @xmath26 ) of the moving nucleus and the lorentz factor .",
    "accordingly , the @xmath22 resolution depends on the uncertainties in the @xmath0-ray angle , @xmath27 , the beam velocity , @xmath28 , and the measured @xmath0 energy , @xmath29 , according to @xmath30 the angular resolution @xmath31 depends on the detector size and its distance from the @xmath0-ray emission source .",
    "the uncertainty of the beam velocity @xmath28 is determined by the beam - energy spread and the thickness of the reaction target where the beam loses its energy .",

    "<S> a nai(tl ) detector array called dali2 ( detector array for low intensity radiation 2 ) has been constructed for in - beam @xmath0-ray spectroscopy experiments with fast radioactive isotope ( ri ) beams . </S>",
    "<S> it consists typically of 186 nai(tl ) scintillators covering polar angles from @xmath115@xmath2 to @xmath1160@xmath2 with an average angular resolution of 6@xmath2 in full width at half maximum . </S>",
    "<S> its high granularity ( good angular resolution ) enables doppler - shift corrections that result in , for example , 10% energy resolution and 20% full - energy photopeak efficiency for 1-mev @xmath0 rays emitted from fast - moving nuclei ( velocities of @xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> dali2 has been employed successfully in numerous experiments using fast ri beams with velocities of @xmath4 provided by the riken ri beam factory .    </S>",
