    "this paper is concerned with the following classical result , known as poincar inequality ( or poincar - friedrichs inequality ) :    [ poincare ] let @xmath5 be a bounded domain satisfying the interior cone condition , and @xmath6 .",
    "then , there exists a constant @xmath1 such that @xmath7    the proof is very simple and standard .",
    "assume , reasoning by contradiction , that @xmath8 is a sequence such that    @xmath9    by the rellich - kondrachov theorem , one obtains that @xmath10 , where :    @xmath11 but if @xmath12 almost everywhere in a domain , then @xmath13 must be constant ( see chapter 9 of @xcite , for instance ) . and this yields the desired contradiction .    as one can observe , two main ingredients come into play in the proof : first , the compactness of the @xmath14 embedding .",
    "for that one needs the interior cone condition on @xmath4 and its boundedness .",
    "second , the connectedness of the domain .    in this paper",
    "we try to answer the following question : under which conditions on @xmath4 we can assure the existence of @xmath3 independently of the set @xmath4 ?",
    "the above discussion suggests that one should need three kind of assumptions :    1 .   a uniform bound on @xmath4 , 2 .",
    "an interior cone condition ( with a fixed cone ) , 3 .   and , in a certain sense , a uniform connectedness assumption on @xmath4 .",
    "the goal of this paper is to prove that this is indeed the case .",
    "the uniformity of the poincar constant is useful in some free boundary problems or shape optimization problems , see @xcite .",
    "our motivation comes from the derivation of a uniform local version of the moser - trudinger inequality , which is very useful in the variational study of the mean field equation on compact surfaces ( see @xcite , and also @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we hope to use the results of this paper to give a proof for such inequality in a forthcoming work .    before going on with our exposition ,",
    "let us mention some previous results .",
    "in the literature there are some results concerning the dependence of the poincar constant on @xmath4 : see for instance @xcite . however , the assumptions required there involve uniform @xmath15 regularity on @xmath4 and other conditions . here",
    "we are interested in a less regular framework . on the contrary , in @xcite",
    "more information is given , related to the solution of the associated neumann eigenvalue problem .",
    "in @xcite the uniformity of the poincar constant is proved for uniformly lipschitz domains .",
    "let us point out that lipschitz domains must lie ( locally ) on one side of the boundary .",
    "the unit ball with a segment removed , for instance , is not lipschitz .",
    "moreover , domains with interior cusps are not covered , for instance . in both cases the poincar inequality holds , which makes",
    "one think that the uniform lipschitz assumption is too restrictive .    throughout the paper we shall use the following notation :    @xmath16    we will consider the following hypotheses .    1",
    ".   [ h1 ] there exists @xmath17 such that @xmath18 .",
    "[ h2 ] there exists a fixed finite cone @xmath19 such that each point @xmath20 is the vertex of a cone @xmath21 congruent to @xmath19 and contained in @xmath4 .",
    "[ h3 ] there exists @xmath22 such that for any @xmath23 , @xmath24 is a connected set .",
    "this last condition is a sort of  uniform connectedness assumption \" .",
    "we will show in example [ ejemplo ] that a condition in this direction is necessary in our results . roughly speaking ,",
    "condition [ h3 ] avoids the existence of arbitrarily narrow junctions between two regions in @xmath4 .",
    "the main result of this note is the following .",
    "[ main ] for any @xmath6 there exists a constant @xmath25 such that for any domain @xmath4 satisfying [ h1]-[h3 ] ,    @xmath26 here @xmath3 depends only on @xmath27 , @xmath28 and the cone @xmath19 given in conditions [ h1]-[h3 ]",
    ".    we can also give some generalizations of this result , that will be discussed in section 3 .",
    "in particular , we can prove the uniform estimate in the following situation :    [ coro ] for any @xmath6 , @xmath17 and @xmath29 there exists a constant @xmath25 such that for any connected set @xmath30 ,    @xmath31 here @xmath32 denotes the domain @xmath33 .",
    "observe that @xmath3 is independent of the choice of @xmath34 .",
    "the uniformity of the poincar constant on this type of sets was the original motivation of our work .",
    "we think that this corollary could be one of the ingredients of a future local version of the moser - trudinger inequality .",
    "our results improve that of @xcite since a connected and uniformly lipschitz domain satisfy our conditions [ h1]-[h3 ] ( see the final appendix ) .",
    "moreover , we can cover many situations in which the domains are not lipschitz , as explained above .",
    "our proof is also quite different from that of @xcite , which uses different notions of convergence of sets to pass to a limit in an argument by contradiction . here",
    "we give a direct proof , based on two main tools .",
    "the first one is the following property :    1 .",
    "[ q ] for any @xmath35 , there exists @xmath36 independent of @xmath4 such that @xmath37",
    ".    let us point out that any domain @xmath4 satisfies that condition with @xmath38 depending on @xmath4 ; this is due to the continuity from above of the lebesgue measure .",
    "we shall see that conditions [ h1 ] and [ h2 ] imply the uniformity of the choice of @xmath38 .",
    "the second ingredient of our arguments is the observation on the uniformity of the constant in the sobolev embedding under our hypotheses .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we first give some preliminary results , some of them well - known , which are useful later in the proof of theorem [ main ] .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the discussion of some extensions of our results .",
    "in particular , corollary [ coro ] will be proved in section 3 . in a final appendix",
    "we show that uniformly lipschitz domains , bounded and connected , satisfy conditions [ h1]-[h3 ] .",
    "this implies that theorem [ main ] generalizes the result of @xcite .",
    "in this section we first give some preliminary results , which will be of use later .",
    "after that , we shall prove theorem [ main ] .",
    "some notation is in order ; given @xmath39 and @xmath40 , we define :    @xmath41    we also need a notion of uniformity for the lipschitz regularity of a domain .",
    "the following definition follows closely that of chenais @xcite .",
    "we first introduce some notation . given @xmath42 , we denote @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 give the coordinates of @xmath46 in a given coordinate system .",
    "[ def : lip ] we say that @xmath4 is a uniform lipschitz domain with constants @xmath47 , @xmath48 ( and we denote @xmath49 if the following is satisfied :    for all @xmath50 , there exists a local coordinate system satisfying what follows",
    ". there exists a function @xmath51 a lipschitz function with lipschitz constant smaller than @xmath52 such that :    @xmath53    here ,    @xmath54 @xmath55    observe that for uniformly bounded domains , this definition coincides with the definition of strong local lipschitz property of adams ( @xcite , page 66 ) .",
    "this property is equivalent to the condition assumed in @xcite , see section 3 of @xcite .",
    "now let us recall and comment the following result , due to gagliardo @xcite ( alternatively , see adams @xcite , theorem 4.8 ) .",
    "[ teo : ga ] let @xmath4 a bounded domain satisfying the cone condition [ h2 ] .",
    "then there exists a finite collection @xmath56 of open subsets of @xmath4 such that :    1 .   @xmath57 .",
    "2 .   @xmath58 is a lipschitz domain .",
    "[ rem : ga ] by having a look at the proof of the above result ( @xcite , theorem 4.8 ) , one obtains easily that the lipschitz constants of the graphs depend only on the cone @xmath19 .",
    "moreover , the number of sets @xmath59 in the proof can be bounded in terms of @xmath19 and @xmath60 of condition [ h1 ] .",
    "this implies the following uniform version : under conditions [ h1 ] and [ h2 ] , then @xmath61 , and @xmath62 , @xmath52 , @xmath63 are positive constants depending only on the cone @xmath19 and the constant @xmath60 given by conditions [ h1 ] and [ h2 ] .",
    "in the following proposition we prove property [ q ] , which will be essential in our proof of theorem [ main ] .",
    "[ prop : q ] let us fix @xmath17 and a finite cone @xmath19 .",
    "then , property [ q ] holds for any @xmath4 satisfying [ h1 ] and [ h2 ] referred to @xmath60 and @xmath19 respectively .",
    "we will prove the proposition in two steps :    the case @xmath64 .",
    "this is straightforward .",
    "indeed , consider a graph like in definition [ def : lip ] , and take @xmath65 sufficiently small .",
    "define    @xmath66    it is clear that for any point @xmath67 , the distance to the boundary of @xmath4 is at most @xmath68 , where @xmath52 is the lipschitz constant of @xmath69 .",
    "therefore ,    @xmath70    observe also that the number of graphs needed to cover @xmath4 is uniformly bounded .",
    "so it suffices to take @xmath71 sufficiently small , according to @xmath72 .",
    "indeed , it follows that the dependence of @xmath38 on @xmath72 is linear .    the general case , with @xmath73 satisfying [ h1 ] , [ h2 ] .    by [ teo : ga ] ,",
    "@xmath74 where each @xmath75 .",
    "obviously , @xmath76 .",
    "then , it is easy to show that :    @xmath77    then , we can conclude by step 1 .",
    "since @xmath78 depend only on @xmath19 and @xmath60 , we obtain the uniform estimate .",
    "another important tool in our proof is the classical sobolev embedding .",
    "the uniformity of the sobolev constant is important for our purposes and not so well - known , so let us state it in detail . for a proof , see @xcite , lemmas 5.10 and 5.15 , and also theorem 8.25 ( observe the remark at the end of the proof of this last theorem ) .",
    "[ sobolev ] let @xmath5 satisfy [ h1 ] , [ h2 ] , and @xmath6 .",
    "then there exists @xmath79 depending only on @xmath80 and @xmath81 such that :    1 .",
    "if @xmath82 , @xmath83 , for any @xmath84 , @xmath85 $ ] .",
    "2 .   if @xmath86 , @xmath83 , for any @xmath84 , @xmath87 .",
    "+ even more , there holds : @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the orlicz norm associated to @xmath90 .",
    "if @xmath91 , then any function @xmath92 is equal almost everywhere to a continuous function .",
    "moreover , @xmath93 .",
    "so far , we have considered conditions [ h1 ] and [ h2 ] .",
    "condition [ h3 ] is less standard and can be considered as a uniform connectedness condition . in the following example",
    "we show that this condition is indeed necessary for the thesis of the theorem [ main ] .",
    "[ ejemplo ]    in this example we consider @xmath94 , and we write the coordinates of a point in @xmath95 as @xmath96 , with @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "let us define the cone :    @xmath99    for any @xmath35 , we define the set :    @xmath100 where @xmath101 .    clearly , @xmath102 is a connected set and the family of sets @xmath102 satisfy [ h1 ] and [ h2 ] , but they do not satisfy [ h3 ] . we shall find a sequence @xmath103 such that : @xmath104    define @xmath105    since @xmath106 is odd with respect to the @xmath107 variable , @xmath108 .",
    "it is also easy to show that : @xmath109    finally , we compute :    @xmath110    now we are in conditions to prove our main result :    choose @xmath35 arbitrarily small , to be fixed at the end of the proof .",

    "@xmath120    since @xmath117 is finite , take @xmath121 the maximum of all those constants .",

    "define :    @xmath122    observe that under our assumptions @xmath123 .",

    "take now @xmath126 with @xmath127 , @xmath128 .",
    "our intention is to find a lower bound for @xmath129 .",
    "let us assume that @xmath130 , otherwise we are done .",
    "we first give an estimate on @xmath131 by using hlder inequality :    @xmath132    let us denote by @xmath133 the average of u on @xmath124 .",
    "then ,    @xmath134    observe also that @xmath135 , where @xmath136 is the volume the cone @xmath19 , which serves as a lower bound for the volume of @xmath4 .",
    "we choose @xmath72 small enough so that @xmath137 .",
    "our intention now is to find a lower estimate for the term @xmath138    we now use again hlder inequality to estimate the term :    @xmath139    therefore ,    @xmath140    it suffices now to estimate @xmath141 .",
    "let us take any @xmath142 so that the sobolev embedding holds , see proposition [ sobolev ] .",
    "since we are assuming that @xmath143 , we have that @xmath144 . by using again hlder inequality ,",

    "second , [ h1 ] is used to derive property [ q ] given in proposition [ prop : q ] , which otherwise should be somehow imposed .",
    "indeed , we can introduce it in a generalized version of condition [ h3 ] .",
    "our result can be generalized as follows .",

    "the details are left to the reader .",
    "the literature on sobolev inequalities for domains not satisfying the cone property is huge .",
    "for instance , it is known that the limiting sobolev inequality does not hold for domains containing outward cusps . however , for cusps having power sharpness , a sobolev embedding to some @xmath184 space is possible , see @xcite .",
    "it is to be expected that some uniformity on the assumptions would imply an uniform constant in that inequality , providing [ f2 ] .",
    "many other sobolev embeddings have also been found , and it is not possible to give here a detailed account of them : see for instance @xcite and the references therein . on the other hand ,",
    "condition [ f3 ] puts together condition [ q ] and [ h3 ] in a more general fashion .",
    "condition [ f3 ] does not seem easy to check in general , though .",
    "however , as a particular case , we can prove corollary [ coro ] .",
    "it is not clear to us whether a domain under the conditions of corollary [ coro ] satisfies condition [ h3 ] . in any case ,",
    "corollary [ coro ] is a consequence of theorem [ general ] , as we show below .",
    "we only need to check that under the conditions of corollary [ coro ] , we can apply theorem [ general ] .",
    "let us define :    @xmath185    we recall for the definition of @xmath32 . in what follows we can always consider @xmath34 to be a compact set ; otherwise , we would argue on its closure .",
    "clearly , any domain in @xmath177 satisfies the cone property with a cone depending only on @xmath116 .",

    "the triangular inequality readily implies that @xmath191 . in order to prove [ f3 ] , it suffices to estimate the measure of @xmath192 independently of the choice of @xmath34 .",
    "let us point out that :    @xmath193    the first equality holds just by the definition of @xmath189 ; let us justify briefly the second identity .",
    "the inclusion @xmath194 follows easily from the triangular inequality . for the inclusion @xmath195 ,",

    "now , observe that @xmath205 satisfies the cone condition with a fixed cone .",
    "now it suffices to recall the arguments of the proof of proposition [ prop : q ] to conclude .      because of our original motivation in the study of local versions of the moser - trudinger inequality , we are interested in a uniform poincar inequality in compact riemannian manifolds .",
    "this extension is quite direct , but it deserves a couple of comments .",
    "first of all , we have not been able to find a specific definition of the interior cone condition for a domain in a manifold .",
    "still , we think that it must be written elsewhere , but since we can not cite a reference we give below a definition which is useful for our purposes .",
    "let @xmath206 be a compact manifold .",
    "it is clear that we can consider on @xmath206 a finite family of charts @xmath207 , @xmath208 such that @xmath209 .",
    "we say that @xmath210 satisfies the interior cone condition if for any @xmath211 such that @xmath212 , @xmath213 satisfies the interior cone condition at any point of @xmath214 .    by using this finite family of charts",
    "it is easy to generalize proposition [ q ] to the case of sub - domains of a fixed compact riemannian manifold ( instead of [ h1 ] ) .",
    "moreover , also the uniform sobolev embedding holds , as can be easily checked passing to charts .",
    "therefore , the results of theorem [ main ] , theorem [ general ] and corollary [ coro ] follow with basically the same proof .",
    "in theorem [ main ] we have proved the uniformity of the poincar constant for domains satisfying certain properties , namely [ h1 ] , [ h2 ] , [ h3 ] . in this final section",
    "we show that connected uniformly lipschitz domains ( in the sense of definition [ def : lip ] ) satisfy [ h2 ] and [ h3 ] .",
    "so , our result extends that of @xcite to a less regular framework .",
    "property [ h2 ] being straightforward , it suffices to show property [ h3 ] .",
    "the proof we give here is inspired by min - max theory and deformation flows .",
    "it is possible that there is a more direct way to prove this result , but in our opinion the proof itself is interesting in its own right .",
    "observe that with that definition , @xmath217 and @xmath218 ( for @xmath36 ) .",
    "the idea of the proof is to show that those two sets are homotopically equivalent if @xmath219 , for some @xmath220 small independent of @xmath4 . in order to prove that",
    ", we will use a deformation argument .",
    "it is important to observe here that @xmath221 is a lipschitz map , but not @xmath15 , and therefore one can not use a gradient flow as usually .",
    "however , in 1981 , k. c. chang ( @xcite ) was able to apply variational methods to lipschitz maps . for that",
    ", he needed a notion of generalized gradient , due to clarke , that we remind below .",
    "moreover , he was able to prove the existence of a continuous pseudogradient flow for lipschitz maps . with these two main tools , he was able to apply min - max techniques to lipschitz functionals .",
    "here we just use those ideas to find an homotopical equivalence between @xmath4 and @xmath222 . for that , we will need to show that @xmath221 has no critical points in @xmath223 ; it is here that the lipschitz assumption on @xmath4 comes into play .",
    "it can be checked that the function @xmath229 is continuous and convex , and that @xmath230 , where @xmath231 is the lipschitz constant for @xmath225 .",

    "take @xmath241 .",
    "we will show that there exists @xmath242 such that @xmath243 ; this readily implies that @xmath221 has no critical points in @xmath244 .            here",
    "@xmath250 is chosen depending on @xmath52 , @xmath63 . by the lipschitz property of the domain , @xmath251 for any @xmath252 .",
    "in other words , @xmath253 ( see ) . an easy geometrical argument",
    "implies the following ( see figure 1 ) :        let @xmath257 be a uniformly lipschitz domain , with the definition [ def : lip ] , and @xmath221 the map defined in .",
