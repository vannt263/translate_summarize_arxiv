    "<S> we present optical sideband spectroscopy measurements of a mesoscopic mechanical oscillator cooled near its quantum ground state . </S>",
    "<S> the mechanical oscillator , corresponding to a @xmath0 acoustic mode of a patterned silicon nanobeam , is coupled via radiation pressure to a pair of co - localized @xmath1  thz optical modes . </S>",
    "<S> the mechanical mode is cooled close to its quantum ground state from a bath temperature of @xmath2  k using radiation pressure back - action stemming from the optical pumping of one of the optical cavity resonances . </S>",
    "<S> an optical probe beam , resonant with the second optical cavity resonance , is used to transduce the mechanical motion and determine the phonon occupancy of the mechanical mode . </S>",
    "<S> measurement of the asymmetry between up - converted and down - converted photons of the probe beam yields directly the displacement noise power associated with the quantum zero - point motion of the mechanical oscillator , and provides an absolute calibration of the average phonon occupancy of the mechanical mode .    </S>",
    "<S> the heisenberg uncertainty principle , one of the fundamental consequences of quantum theory , restricts the certainty with which the position and momentum of an object may be simultaneously known and defined . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , an object confined to a local potential possesses a non - zero ground state energy associated with random quantum fluctuations of its position . for mechanical systems of our daily experience </S>",
    "<S> , this so - called quantum zero - point motion is masked by thermal noise resulting from interaction with the environment . </S>",
    "<S> to observe quantum motion , the dual and antagonistic feats of isolating a mechanical system from its environment whilst measuring its position must be achieved  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , coupled electro- and opto - mechanical systems have been cooled into their mechanical quantum ground state by a combination of cryogenic pre - cooling and radiation pressure back - action  @xcite . in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we extend these results by laser cooling the acoustic mode of a silicon optomechanical crystal resonator to near its quantum ground state ( occupancy @xmath3 phonons ) while simultaneously monitoring its motion with a probe laser resonant with a secondary optical mode of the cavity . operating in the resolved sideband regime , </S>",
    "<S> the spectral selectivity of the secondary cavity mode is used to separate , measure , and compare the intensity of the blue- ( anti - stokes ) and red - shifted ( stokes ) sidebands created by the mechanical resonator s motion . the observed asymmetry in the probe sideband amplitudes </S>",
    "<S> provides a direct measure of the displacement noise power associated with quantum zero - point fluctuations and allows for an intrinsic calibration of the phonon occupation number of the nanomechanical resonator .    </S>",
    "<S> experiments with trapped atomic ions and neutral atoms  @xcite , dating back several decades , utilized techniques such as resolved sideband laser cooling and motional sideband absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy to cool and measure a single trapped particle in its vibrational quantum ground state . </S>",
    "<S> these experiments generated significant interest in the coherent control of motion and the quantum optics of trapped atoms and ions@xcite , and were important stepping stones towards the development of ion - trap based quantum computing  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> larger scale mechanical objects , such as fabricated nanomechanical resonators , have only recently been cooled close to their quantum mechanical ground state of motion  @xcite . in a pioneering experiment by oconnell , et al .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , a piezoelectric nanomechanical resonator has been cryogenically cooled ( @xmath4  mk ) to its vibrational ground state and strongly coupled to a superconducting circuit qubit allowing for quantum state preparation and read - out of the mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> an alternate line of research has been pursued in circuit and cavity optomechanics  @xcite , where the position of a mechanical oscillator is coupled to the frequency of a high-@xmath5 electromagnetic resonance allowing for back - action cooling  @xcite and continuous position read - out of the oscillator . </S>",
    "<S> such optomechanical resonators have long been pursued as quantum - limited sensors of weak classical forces  @xcite , with more recent studies exploring optomechanical systems as quantum optical memories and amplifiers  @xcite , quantum nonlinear dynamical elements  @xcite , and quantum interfaces in hybrid quantum systems  @xcite .    despite the major advances in circuit and cavity optomechanical systems made in the last few years , all experiments to date involving the cooling of mesoscopic mechanical oscillators have relied on careful measurement and calibration of the motionally scattered light to obtain the average phonon occupancy of the oscillator , @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> approach towards the quantum ground state in such experiments is manifest only as a weaker measured signal , with no evident demarcation between the classical and quantum regimes of the oscillator . </S>",
    "<S> a crucial aspect of zero - point fluctuations of the quantum ground state , is that they can not supply energy , but can only contribute to processes where energy is absorbed by the mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> this is completely different from classical noise . </S>",
    "<S> techniques that attempt to measure zero - point motion without being sensitive to this aspect ( i.e. , standard continuous linear position detection ) can always be interpreted classically and described by some effective temperature .    </S>",
    "<S> a more direct method of thermometry and characterization of the quantized nature of a mechanical oscillator , one particularly suited to small @xmath6 and utilized in the above - mentioned trapped atom experiments  @xcite , is referred to as motional sideband spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> this method relies on the fundamental asymmetry in the quantum processes of absorption from ( proportional to @xmath6 ) and emission into ( proportional to @xmath7 ) the mechanical oscillator of phonons . in the case of atomic systems </S>",
    "<S> , this asymmetry can be measured in the motionally - generated stokes and anti - stokes sidebands in either the fluorescence or absorption spectrum of the atom . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio of the stokes to anti - stokes motional sideband amplitudes ( @xmath8 ) deviates significantly from unity as the quantum ground state is reached ( @xmath9 ) , and provides a self - calibrated reference for the phonon occupancy . in the present experiment we cool a nanomechanical resonator to near its quantum ground state , and measure the asymmetry in the motional sidebands utilizing a form of resolved sideband spectroscopy based upon the filtering properties of a high-@xmath5 optical cavity with linewidth narrower than the mechanical frequency .        </S>",
    "<S> the cavity optomechanical system studied in this work consists of a patterned silicon nanobeam which forms an optomechanical crystal ( omc )  @xcite capable of localizing both optical and acoustic waves ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : om_device ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the cavity is designed to have two optical resonances , one for cooling and one for read - out of mechanical motion . </S>",
    "<S> the cooling mode is chosen as the fundamental mode of the patterned nanobeam cavity , with a frequency @xmath10 and a corresponding free - space wavelength of @xmath11  nm . </S>",
    "<S> the read - out mode is the second - order mode of the cavity with @xmath12 ( @xmath13  nm ) . </S>",
    "<S> an in - plane mechanical breathing mode at @xmath14 , confined at the center of the nanobeam due to acoustic bragg reflection , couples to both optical resonances with zero - point optomechanical coupling rates @xmath15 and @xmath16 for the cooling and read - out modes , respectively ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 are measured for each cavity mode from optically - induced damping of the mechanical mode as in ref .  </S>",

    "<S> the hamiltonian of the coupled system is given by & = & ( _ r + g_r /x _ ) + ( _ c + g_c /x _ ) + & &   + _ m , where we have defined @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) and @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) to be the annihilation ( creation ) operators for photons in the cooling and read - out modes of the optical cavity . </S>",
    "<S> the optical modes are coupled to the mechanical displacement operator of the breathing mode , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the creation and annihilation operators for phonons in the mechanical resonator , and @xmath26 is the zero - point fluctuation amplitude of the mechanical motion .        </S>",

    "<S> at this temperature the mechanical damping rate to the thermal bath is found to be @xmath30 , corresponding to a intrinsic quality factor @xmath31 . </S>",

    "<S> an optical fiber taper , formed from standard single mode optical fiber , is used to optically probe the omc cavity via evanescent coupling . </S>",
    "<S> the component of extrinsic damping resulting from coupling to the optical fiber taper waveguide is measured to be @xmath34 for the cooling mode and @xmath35 for the read - out mode .    as alluded to above , </S>",
    "<S> resolved sideband cooling in optomechanical cavities follows physics which is formally similar to the raman processes used to cool ions to their motional ground state  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a cooling laser , with frequency @xmath36 , is tuned a mechanical frequency red of the cooling cavity resonance of the omc , giving rise to an intra - cavity photon population @xmath37 at frequency @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> the oscillations of the mechanical system cause scattering of the intra - cavity cooling beam laser light into stokes and anti - stokes sidebands at @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively . since the anti - stokes sideband is resonant with the cavity at @xmath40 , and @xmath41 , the anti - stokes optical up - conversion process is greatly enhanced relative to the stokes down - conversion process . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to cooling of the mechanical mode and can be modeled effectively as an additional mechanical damping term of @xmath42 due to coupling to a near - zero temperature bath represented by the cooling laser . </S>",
    "<S> assuming a deeply resolved sideband system ( @xmath43 ) , the back - action cooled mechanical mode occupancy is approximately given by @xmath44  @xcite .    , of a quantum simple harmonic oscillator , plotted against @xmath45 for clarity . * </S>",

[ </S>",

    "<S> this absorption - emission asymmetry has absolutely no classical analogue . of course , at high phonon occupation numbers where @xmath54 </S>",
    "<S> , the classically symmetric spectral density is recovered . since the optical cavity frequency </S>",
    "<S> is linearly coupled to the position of the mechanical oscillator , the displacement noise spectrum is imprinted on the photons leaving the cavity and can be measured optically , with the stokes ( anti - stokes ) motional sideband proportional to the positive ( negative ) frequencies of @xmath51 .    </S>",

    "<S> this simple argument neglects the back - action of the read - out beam on the mechanical oscillator . in particular , the mechanical damping rate becomes detuning dependent , with @xmath66 for @xmath65 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath67 is the effective cooperativity of the read - out beam in the presence of the strong cooling beam , and is found from the measured spectra by the relation @xmath68 the back - action of the read - out beam also results in a corresponding change in the phonon occupancy with read - out beam detuning , given by @xmath69 for @xmath65 , where @xmath70 is the mechanical mode occupancy in the presence of only the cooling beam . in our measurements </S>",
    "<S> this dependence is made small by ensuring that the read - out beam is much weaker than the cooling beam , so that @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> adding in a correction for the read - out laser back - action , one finds the following relation between the measured motional sidebands and the phonon occupancy of the cooled mechanical oscillator , ^ - = , [ eqn : iratio ] where for @xmath71 we recover the standard relation given in equation  ( [ eqn : iratio_ideal ] ) .        </S>",
