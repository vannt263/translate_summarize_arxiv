    "observations show strong magnetization@xcite ( up to a few@xmath14 g ) and fast rotation@xcite ( up to a period of 30s ) of white dwarfs not to be very unusual .",
    "this indicates that an existence of a strongly magnetized fast rotating white dwarf can not be excluded .",
    "one of these objects ( a white dwarf with the spin period of 33s and the surface field of @xmath15 mg ) is discovered in ae  aquarii .",
    "the spin - down power of this white dwarf exceeds its bolometric luminosity by a factor of 300 and can be explained in terms of the spin - powered pulsar energy - loss mechanism provided the dipolar magnetic moment of the star is@xcite @xmath16 .",
    "the fast rotating extended magnetosphere in this case prevents the surrounding material from reaching the stellar surface .",
    "the interaction between the surrounding material and the stellar magnetic field leads to a formation of a stream which is flowing out from the binary system@xcite .",
    "the spin - down power of the white dwarf is released predominantly in a form of the wind of relativistic particles@xcite .",
    "thus , the white dwarfs in the ejector state do exist but how could they forme ?",
    "as the surface temperature of the white dwarf in ae  aquarii is limited to@xcite @xmath17k its age@xcite @xmath18yr turns out to be significantly larger than the spin - down timescale@xcite @xmath19yr .",
    "this indicates that the ejector white dwarf is a product of the binary evolution which included an epoch of its rapid spin - up caused by intensive accretion .",
    "the parameters of the spin - up epoch are the following@xcite : + i )  accretion from a keplerian disk at a rate @xmath20 on a timescale of a few million years ; + ii )  screening of the magnetic field of the white dwarf by the accreted material by a factor of@xcite 50100 ; + iii )  re - emerging of the magnetic field due to diffusion of the stellar magnetic field through the layer of the accreted material on a timescale @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the spin - down timescale which for the parameters of ae  aquarii is @xmath23myr . for this condition to be satisfied the total mass accreted by the white dwarf during the spin - up epoch should not exceed @xmath24 and the mass of the white dwarf itself is @xmath25 .",
    "this implies that the inclination angle of the binary system is @xmath26 .",
    "an analysis of this accretion scenario suggests that the more massive the white dwarf is the shorter is the spin period which it can reach at the end of the spin - up epoch .",
    "furthermore , the more massive a white dwarf is the smaller amount of the accreted material is required to spin it up to the shortest possible spin period .",
    "the timescale of the magnetic field re - emerging of the white dwarf after the spin - up epoch is@xcite @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , the more massive the white dwarf is the faster its magnetic field is re - generated .",
    "this increases a probability for the white dwarf to appear as a star in the ejector state .",
