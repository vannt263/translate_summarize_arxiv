    "we discuss wavelength tuning and the effect of disorder in section iv before finally concluding with a study of how this disorder affects the topology in section v.      the photonic lattice with two driving periods was fabricated inside a 70-mm - long glass ( corning eagle@xmath69 ) substrate using the ultrafast laser inscription technique , where the refractive index profile of each waveguide was controlled using the  slit - beam shaping \" method @xcite .",
    "the glass substrate , mounted on @xmath70-@xmath71-@xmath16 translation stages , was translated at 8  mm / s through the focus of a 500  khz train of 1030  nm femtosecond laser pulses to fabricate each waveguide .",
    "the laser inscription parameters were optimized to produce waveguides that were single - mode and well confined in the measurement wavelength range of 700 - 830  nm . to study the response of the edge modes in the presence of a defect at the edge , the waveguide at the ( 8 , 4 ) lattice site was not fabricated .",
    "it should also be highlighted that the waveguide paths are designed such that all waveguides exhibit identical bend radii at a given @xmath16 , although the direction of this bending is site dependent .",
    "this ensures that there is minimal site - dependent losses .    to measure the coupling constants , we fabricated five sets of each bond separately inside the same substrate .",
    "these bonds ( or couplers ) were then characterised in the wavelength range 705 - 795  nm , to obtain the variation of the mean and standard deviation of coupling strength with wavelength ( see supplementary for details ) . to excite the lattices with different wavelengths ,",
    "a photonic crystal fiber was pumped by sub - picosecond laser pulses of 1064  nm wavelength to generate a broadband supercontinuum .",
    "a tunable monochromator placed after the supercontinuum source was used to select narrow band ( @xmath72  nm ) light , which was coupled into an optical fibre ( smf-600 ) .",
    "the fiber was then coupled to the lattice sites .",
    "the output intensity distribution was observed using a cmos camera .",
    "a polarizer passing only vertically polarized light is placed in front of the camera to ensure that the measurements are not affected by polarization - dependent coupling .      in the experimental setup ,",
    "the lattice constant was chosen such that , in the absence of any bending , the waveguides comprising the lattice were practically uncoupled . in order to turn on the coupling between two neighbouring sites",

    "the coupling between two such synchronously bending waveguides was demonstrated in ref .",

    "a derivation is provided here for completeness .",
    "the dynamics of how light propagates through an array of weakly - guiding waveguides is governed by the scalar helmholtz equation , @xmath73 here @xmath74 is the electric field amplitude , @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the wavelength of the light in free space , and @xmath77 is the refractive index profile in the domain of interest . if the wave propagation is primarily along the @xmath16-axis , then the field @xmath78 can be represented as a slowly varying complex field amplitude and a fast oscillating wave , @xmath79 .",
    "substituting @xmath80 into the helmholtz equation and making the slowly varying envelope approximation for @xmath81 gives @xmath82 the refractive index profile can be written as @xmath83 .",

    "+ multiplying by @xmath96 and integrating transversely gives @xmath97 where @xmath98 a number of pertinent statements can be made about these integrals : @xmath99 these statements have the corollary that @xmath100 as previously mentioned , in the absence of any bending there is negligible coupling between any of the waveguides .",
    "the consequence of this is that in the presence of bending , only pairs of waveguides are coupled at any given moment . the coupled mode equations for this system",
    "can then be written as block diagonal matrices with each block comprising a @xmath101 matrix .",
    "this simplifies the following to a study of a two waveguide coupler as the analysis will straightforwardly generalise to the full lattice .",

    "the coupled - mode equations for this @xmath106 block can therefore be written in matrix notation as @xmath107 where the matrices @xmath108 and @xmath109 have the form @xmath110 here @xmath111 and @xmath112 . to proceed",
    "further we introduce a new set of variables by @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is chosen such that @xmath115 .",

    "can be straightforwardly solved to yield @xmath123 where @xmath109 has the form @xmath124 in the second equality , the cross - power term , @xmath125 , has been neglected , which is a valid approximation as long as the waveguides remain far apart throughout the bending motion .",
    "+ a return to the original @xmath126 variables can be made by inverting the non - singular matrix @xmath114 , @xmath127 where @xmath128 are the initial conditions .",
    "the waveguides in the experimental lattice are coming together and then moving apart .",
    "consequently , at the end of the bending section , @xmath129 , the waveguides are at the same separation as at @xmath130 and so @xmath131 .",
    "this allows the matrix product @xmath132 to take the form @xmath133 with @xmath134 for comparison , the evolution operator for two straight waveguides of length @xmath135 is given by @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the coupling between the waveguides .",
    "as can be readily observed , this has the same form as eq .   if we write @xmath138 as @xmath139 where @xmath140 is an effective coupling .",
    "this analysis has been conducted for two waveguides , but can be readily extended to the full lattice discussed in the main text .",
    "the experimental lattice is written such that only pairs of waveguides are coupled at any given moment .",
    "the @xmath108 and @xmath114 matrices therefore have block - diagonal matrix form with the blocks all having the form of eq .  .",
    "in this section the methodology used to obtain the topological phase diagram in fig .",
    "@xmath141 ( main text ) is detailed ; this method is based on ref .",
    "@xcite , and we refer the reader to this reference for more details on concepts related to the topological characterisation of floquet systems . the calculation of the different phases is assisted by utilizing the property that the topology of the system can only change when there is a gap closing between the two bulk bands .",
    "the position of these gap - closing events can be found analytically by diagonalizing the evolution operator at the end of the driving period .",
    "it is found that for @xmath142 and @xmath143 the system is gapless at quasienergy zero , whilst for @xmath144 and @xmath145 the system is gapless through the fundamental zone edge .",
    "the position of these gap closings thereby divides the phase space into the eight different sectors shown in fig .",
    "the topology within these different sectors can then be defined by calculation of the winding numbers . as discussed in eq .",
    ", at any time @xmath22 the evolution operator may be diagonalized to yield the instantaneous bloch bands of the driven system .",
    "the eigenstates associated with these bands can be used to calculate an instantaneous chern number for that band . in accordance with eq .",
    "the winding number can then be calculated by tracking changes in the chern number of the lowest band that occur through the zone edge throughout the driving period .",
    "this procedure is illustrated in fig .",
    "@xmath146 ( a ) for the parameters @xmath147 , @xmath148 , which shows how the instantaneous chern number of the lowest band changes throughout the driving period .",
    "it can be readily observed that that the chern number changes twice within a driving period and computing the spectra at these times shows that the second of these changes occurs through the zone edge , see fig .",
    "@xmath146  ( b - c ) .",
    "this latter degeneracy causes the chern number of the lowest band to decrease by one .",
    "this topological transition through the zone edge when combined with the chern numbers of all the bands being zero at @xmath149 implies , in accordance with eq .",

    "the chern number changes twice within a driving period ( at times @xmath152 and @xmath153 ) .",
    "the first of these topological transitions occurs when the gap closes at @xmath154 , ( b ) , whilst the second occurs at @xmath155 , ( c ) .",
    "this changing of the instantaneous chern number that occurs through the zone edge is responsible for the winding numbers @xmath47 and @xmath48 being non - zero , and the chern number of the floquet bands to be zero .",
    "this non - trivial value for the winding number allows for the presence of edge modes in the spectrum at @xmath149 , ( d ) , even though the chern numbers of all the floquet bands ( evaluated at @xmath156 ) are zero.,width=321 ]      in the main text it was discussed how the experimental setup provides the ability to modify the wavelength of light used as an input .",
    "this ability allows the effective coupling between waveguides to be altered without modifying the lattice . in order to understand the behaviour of the bonds @xmath157 , see main text , as a function of wavelength ,",
    "five sets of isolated bonds were written and the percentage of light transferred from the launch waveguide as a function of wavelength was measured , fig .",
    "[ coupling ] .",
    "this bond characterisation data illustrates how at 785  nm the bonds @xmath157 have almost equal transfer which is close to 100@xmath158 .",
    "this wavelength therefore closely matches the desired parameters discussed in the main text of having three bonds equal and perfectly transferring .     as a function of wavelength . *",
    "the effective coupling can be extracted from this characterisation data using the relation transfer @xmath159 , where @xmath135 is the physical length of the sample .",
    "the dotted line indicates that the transfer is very close to 100@xmath158 for all the three bonds at 785  nm wavelength.,width=321 ]    the capability of this wavelength tuning technique in our experimental setup allows for the transfer of the bonds to be changed substantially from @xmath160 right down to @xmath161 .",
    "this provides the ability to compare experimental and theoretical predictions for a wide range of parameters . in order to perform such a comparison ,",
    "the coupling strengths extracted from the bond characterisation data were used to calculate a theoretical centre of mass drift , @xmath162 , that could be compared to experimental results .",
    "the centre of mass drift is defined as @xmath163 where @xmath164 is the intensity in the @xmath165-th site at the output , @xmath166 is the coordinates of the @xmath165-th site and @xmath167 are the coordinates of the launch site .",
    "experimental data was taken at four different physical locations in the lattice .",
    "these different positions should , in the absence of disorder , produce identical results for @xmath162 , up to a sign change .",
    "however , the non - zero standard deviations measured in the bond characterisation data indicates the presence of bond strength disorder within the lattice ( such a disorder will be referred to as  off - diagonal disorder \" ) .",
    "the effects of this disorder can be directly observed in the experimental lattice with the four different launch sites producing slightly different results for @xmath162 , see the error bars in fig .",
    "[ cm](a ) . in order to theoretically model this disorder ,",
    "the strengths of the bonds @xmath157 were randomly selected to lie within the range measured in the bond characterisation data .",

    "the experimental lattice should reproduce a driven - lattice model that exhibits anomalous topological edge modes ( i.e.  chiral edge modes that are associated with non - zero winding numbers , while the chern number of the floquet bands is trivial ; see main text ) .",
    "the inclusion of disorder in the system can allow bandgap closings to occur which can modify the topology of the system .",
    "in particular , the disorder could potentially change the chern numbers of the floquet bands to a non - trivial value such that the experimentally observed edge modes would no longer be  anomalous \" .",
    "the elimination of this possibility thereby requires the calculation of the chern number in a disordered system .",
    "the presence of disorder means that quasimomentum is no longer a good quantum number which in turn precludes the use of the usual momentum space techniques in calculating the chern number . in order to overcome this limitation we use a real - space chern invariant , @xmath178 , as introduced by bianco and resta in ref .",
    "this invariant allows for a generalisation of the ( _ static _ ) bulk - edge correspondence to disordered and quasi - periodic lattices  @xcite .",
    "in particular , when the reference energy , @xmath179 , is placed in a mobility gap of the spectrum the chern invariant will measure the number of chiral edge modes which cross this energy , as predicted by the chern numbers of the bands below this energy .",
    "this real - space chern invariant is based around an operator called the chern marker , @xmath180 , which is defined by @xmath181.\\ ] ] here the operators @xmath182 and @xmath183 are expressed in terms of the position operator @xmath184 and the projection operators @xmath185 in the absence of disorder a real space chern number can be defined by averaging the chern marker operator over a unit cell , @xmath186     anywhere within the bulk of the lattice . this local chern marker",
    "is narrowly peaked around zero which implies that the static bulk - edge correspondence would predict no robust chiral edge modes present in the system.,width=325 ]    in the presence of disorder this real - space chern number fluctuates depending upon the position of the unit cell . these fluctuations can be accounted for by replacing the unit - cell average by an average over an area @xmath187 that is located within the bulk and is large compared to the fluctuation length  @xcite .",
    "these ideas thereby provide a mechanism to investigate whether the disorder terms discussed in the previous section can alter the chern numbers of the floquet bands to non - trivial values .",
    "in particular we calculate the local chern marker , in the presence of these disorder terms , for a reference energy of zero , @xmath188 .",
    "the real - space average of this local chern marker , the chern invariant , can be viewed as the prediction coming from the static bulk - edge correspondence for the number of chiral edge modes that are traversing the mobility gap between the two bands .",
    "the results , however , of this analysis reveal that even in the presence of disorder the local chern marker , @xmath189 , is still heavily peaked around zero with this local quantity fluctuating only slightly within the bulk , fig .",
    "the chern invariant is therefore equal to zero independently of the size of the averaging area that is chosen .",
    "consequently , the static bulk - edge correspondence predicts the experimental lattice should not feature any chiral edge modes ."

    "<S> the coupling of the first bond ( @xmath17 ) is different than the following three bonds ( @xmath51 ) , which are chosen so as to satisfy @xmath52 and @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> this gives two controllable experimental parameters , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , that can be tuned independently . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the interplay between these two parameters produces a rich phase diagram , shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> each topological phase of this driven two - band system is accurately labelled by the winding numbers associated with the two bandgaps ; in the phase diagram shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ]  ( a ) , we have chosen @xmath47 to be the winding number for the bandgap centred around quasienergy zero and @xmath48 for the bandgap centred around @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we also provide the chern number of the lowest floquet band @xmath46 , so as to highlight the anomalous regimes where @xmath56 and @xmath57 .    for the sake of experimental practicability , we aim to focus on the anomalous edge modes that are predicted for @xmath58 and @xmath59 , as indicated by the black dot in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> these parameters are desirable as not only is the resultant system located well within the anomalous regime [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ]  ( a ) ] but also the associated spectrum consists of two gapped flat bands [ fig .  [ fig2 ]  ( b ) ] . additionally , the floquet states have a simple analytical form , and there are robust chiral edges states that can be excited with unit efficiency , through the simple experimental technique of single - site excitation .    </S>",
    "<S> the realisation of this model requires a high degree of control over the couplings present in the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> ultrafast - laser - inscribed arrays of optical waveguides with three - dimensional geometry offer this control , as they allow the coupling between lattice sites to be individually controlled . in the experiment presented here , a lattice constant of 40  @xmath60 was chosen , such that the coupling between lattice sites was insignificant over the maximum observable propagation distance . to turn on the coupling between any two waveguides , </S>",
    "<S> the inter - waveguide separation is reduced such that the two waveguides propagate together for a 4.5  mm straight section , with a centre - to - centre waveguide separation of 11  @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> after this interaction region , the waveguides again separate in a reverse manner , see the sketch in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ]  ( d ) . for a particular wavelength , </S>",
    "<S> the coupling that occurs between two synchronously bending waveguides can be shown to be equivalent to that of two straight waveguides with some effective coupling constant ( sup .  mat . ) . </S>",
    "<S> this effective coupling can be controlled by changing the interaction length and/or the separation of the waveguides ; these parameters are fixed upon writing the sample and so do not allow fine - tuning of the coupling in - situ . however , the wavelength of the light used to excite the lattice is a tunable parameter that can be used to control the effective coupling strength ( sup . mat . ) . to demonstrate the existence of anomalous edge modes , </S>",
    "<S> a lattice of size @xmath61 , consisting of two driving cycles , was fabricated . </S>",
    "<S> this lattice also contains a single defect , namely , a missing lattice site on the edge , allowing for the detection of the robustness of edge modes .    to characterise the bonds present in the lattice , and hence validate our theoretical model , we fabricated five sets of each bond in isolation , inside the same substrate , and measured their behaviour as a function of the wavelength of light ( sup .  mat . ) . </S>",
    "<S> when characterised with 785  nm light , the mean and standard deviation of @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) were found to be @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> for the bond @xmath17 , all the light remains in the waveguide excited at the input , which indicates no transfer of light ( @xmath67 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the close proximity of these measured couplings to the aforementioned desired values suggest that anomalous edge modes should be detected for an input wavelength of 785  nm . indeed , the quasienergy spectrum corresponding to these experimental values [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](c ) ] is similar to the ideal case [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](b ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> while a finite dispersion of the bulk now becomes apparent , we note that the velocity of the edge modes remains significantly larger compared to the dispersion of the bulk . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that the non - zero standard deviations indicate that there will be bond - strength disorder within the lattice , whilst a detailed numerical studies of the experimental results also suggest the additional presence of a phase disorder effect ; the latter can be phenomenologically modelled by a small random on - site term . </S>",
    "<S> however , we verified that the topological properties of the lattice are unaffected by these sources of disorder ( sup . mat . ) .    in order to experimentally demonstrate the presence of anomalous topological edge modes , 785  nm light was launched at multiple locations around the edge of the lattice ; the white circles in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ exp ] indicate the launch site . if the light is launched at the middle of an edge , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ exp ]  ( a ) , then at the output it is observed that the light has moved along the edge with minimal penetration into the bulk . moreover , if the input position of the beam is moved further down the edge , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ exp ]  ( b ) , the close proximity of the launch site to the left edge means that the light will encounter the corner of the lattice during its evolution . </S>",
    "<S> this corner , as can be observed in the figure , does not cause backscattering but instead the light simply turns the corner and continues to propagate . </S>",
    "<S> this robustness is also observed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ exp ]  ( c - d ) , which demonstrates the light moving around a missing lattice site without backscattering or penetrating into the bulk . </S>",
    "<S> these observations provide evidence for the existence of protected chiral edge modes that can be almost exclusively excited by single - site excitation . </S>",
    "<S> these experimental observations are well complemented by a theoretical analysis , which was obtained using the couplings extracted from the bond characterisation data . the right - hand image in each panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ exp ] shows the quasienergy spectrum for the lattice and the overlap , as a function of this quasienergy , of the different initial launch states with the numerically calculated floquet states . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ exp ] ( a - e ) demonstrate how launching in a single edge site leads to almost ideal excitation of the edge modes with little probability for bulk modes being excited , even when the launch site is close to a defect or corner . </S>",
    "<S> the absence of this bulk coupling accounts for the strong confinement of the light to the lattice edge .    </S>",
    "<S> the central result of these experimental images is that they show the existence of edge modes propagating in a chiral ( unidirectional ) manner , and which are not scattered by corners nor defects . </S>",
    "<S> the absence of scattering provides strong evidence that there is topological protection for these edge modes . from the bond - strength measurements , combined with our theoretical analysis of the corresponding model , we demonstrate that these propagating states correspond to anomalous topological edge modes .    </S>",
    "<S> the single - site excitation that is used in the experimental setup can also be exploited to probe the different edge modes that are present in the lattice . moving the input site onto the bottom left edge , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ exp ]  ( e ) , shows the light propagating with twice the group velocity to what is observed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ exp ]  ( a ) . </S>",
    "<S> this experimentally demonstrates that , when the bond @xmath17 is different to the other three bonds , edge modes with different group velocities can be observed . </S>",
    "<S> the exact dispersion relations of the edge modes can be altered by modifying the strength of @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> the ability to tune the group velocity could present a valuable experimental tool for the future , which could allow , for instance , the investigation of how the non - scattering behaviour of edge modes is modified by the interplay between group velocity and non - linearity .    the behaviour observed when light is launched in the bulk of the lattice , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ exp ]  ( f ) , is markedly different to what occurs on the edge with the input state being almost exactly reformed at the output facet . </S>",
    "<S> this refocusing is due to the beating between the two bulk bands which are separated by a bandgap of approximately @xmath49 . in an ideal lattice , @xmath68 </S>",
    "<S> , the bulk bands would be dispersionless [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](b ) ] and so the initial state would continue to reform every two driving cycles . </S>",
    "<S> in the experimental lattice , however , deviations of the bonds strengths from the ideal case cause the bands to become dispersive [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](c ) ] , which indicates that the initial state would eventually disperse in lattices of very long propagation lengths . </S>",
    "<S> these deviations could be addressed in future work by careful optimisation of the experimental setup and the waveguide bending profile , so as to allow a closer realisation of the ideal model .    </S>",
    "<S> the ability to easily excite edge modes , with almost unit efficiency , and the possible co - existence of chiral edge modes with a dispersionless bulk , are two particularly interesting features of this slowly - driven photonic system . </S>",
    "<S> these properties make this lattice a promising platform for investigating topological transport properties in response to perturbations , such as external ( engineered ) fields , disorder , and particle - particle interaction ( as generated by optical non - linearities ) .    </S>",
