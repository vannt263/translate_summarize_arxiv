    "the moments of velocity differences over spatial scales of size @xmath3 , the so - called structure functions , provide useful measures of the statistical description of fluid turbulence ( kolmogorov 1941a , b ) .",
    "in particular , the longitudinal structure functions defined as @xmath4^n \\big \\rangle \\label{sn}\\ ] ] have been studied extensively . here",
    ", @xmath5 is the velocity vector at position @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is the unit vector along the separation vector @xmath8 .",
    "the special interest in structure functions comes in part from an exact result , known as the 4/5-ths law , @xmath9 valid in the inertial range of scales ( @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the kolmogorov scale characterizing the dissipative scale of motion and @xmath12 is a suitable large scale of turbulence ) . in part",
    ", the interest is spurred by the operational ease with which longitudinal structure functions can be obtained from experimental data if one makes the so - called taylor s hypothesis ( taylor 1935 ) .",
    "the major impetus for measurements , however , is the scaling result of kolmogorov ",
    "k41 for brevity  that , for high reynolds numbers , the structure functions follow the relation @xmath13 where the scaling exponent @xmath14 . as a result of considerable work ( see , for example ,",
    "anselmet _ et al .",
    "_ 1984 , maurer _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 , arneodo _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 , sreenivasan & antonia 1997 ) , it now appears nearly certain that the scaling exponents deviate from @xmath15 increasingly and nonlinearly as @xmath16 increases .",
    "this is the anomalous scaling .",
    "while some issues remain to be explained satisfactorily ( see , for example , sreenivasan & dhruva 1998 ) , it appears that anomalous scaling is a genuine result worthy of a serious theoretical effort .",
    "consequently , considerable thrusts of research have occurred in this direction ( e.g. , lvov & procaccia 1996 ) .",
    "one obvious concern about high - order moments is that , since they sample the tails of the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of velocity increments  and since some of the associated rare events may be related to well - defined flow structures in real space ",
    "it is not entirely certain that the results for high - order moments are universal because the mean shear and other non - universal features driving the flow could influence the rare structures of turbulence .",
    "in contrast , low - order moments are less susceptible to such non - universal aspects , because they are determined nearly entirely by the core of the pdf and hence sampled frequently .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to regard anomalous scaling  and its universality  as more conclusively established if low - order moments also display anomaly .",
    "this is the main subject of this paper .",
    "the lowest non - trivial structure function that has been studied extensively is the second - order , whose scaling exponent has been shown to be @xmath17 . though this is measurably different from the predicted value of @xmath18 , the difference is too small to be conclusive on its own .",
    "it would thus be useful to examine scaling exponents for moments of still lower orders . since moments of order @xmath0 and below do not exist for velocity increments ( @xcite ) , the range of our current interest is limited to @xmath19 , where @xmath16 is necessarily fractional . with decreasing @xmath16 in this range , if the deviation from @xmath15 decreases , we shall at least know that k41 will be exact in the limit of low - order moments , and regard it as a possible reference point for a theory . if , on the other hand , these deviations remain to be non - trivial as @xmath16 vanishes , it may well be that the understanding of the anomaly can be sought more fruitfully in terms of low - order moments , for the simple reason that such a theory can justifiably ignore rare events .",
    "some preliminary measurements were published in sreenivasan _",
    "( 1996 ) and cao _ et al . _",
    "( 1996 ) but the present paper is a more complete account of the data .",
    "perhaps more importantly , the preliminary numbers did not take account of the possible effects of residual anisotropy in both experiments and simulations , an issue whose importance has been recently highlighted ( biferale & procaccia 2004 ) .",
    "we take account of this feature using a recently developed angle - averaging technique ( taylor _ et al .",
    "_ 2003 ) .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .  2",
    ", we describe the experimental and numerical data used for the present analysis .",
    "this is followed in sec .  3 by the calculation of the fractional structure functions and their scaling exponents from the datasets described in sec .  2 .",
    "the exponents from all sources of data agree well with each other and deviate measurably from the k41 prediction even as @xmath20 .",
    "section 4 contains a brief discussion of the significance of the results .",
    "hotwire measurements were made in the atmospheric surface layer at a height of 35 m above the ground using a standard meteorological tower at brookhaven national laboratory .",
    "the tower itself presented very little obstacle to the wind because of its low solidity .",
    "the dataset analyzed here is part of a more comprehensive batch obtained at the tower .",
    "the hotwire , 0.7 mm in length and 0.5 @xmath21 m in diameter , was placed facing the wind , about two meters away from the tower .",
    "( for monitoring the wind direction , the tower was equipped with a vane anemometer placed two meters away from the measurement station . ) the calibration was performed in situ using a tsi calibrator and checked later in a windtunnel .",
    "the signals were low - pass filtered at 5 khz and sampled at 10 khz .",
    "the anemometer and signal conditioners were placed nearby at the height of measurement , and the conditioned signal was transmitted to the ground and digitized using a 12-bit a / d converter .",
    "typical data records contained between 10 and 40 million samples , during which time the wind direction and its mean speed were deemed acceptably constant .",
    "more details are given in @xcite , but the essential features for this particular set of data are listed in table [ expt_params ] .",
    "the wind conditions were somewhat unstable .",
    ".some relevant parameters for the atmospheric data . here",
    ", @xmath22 is the mean speed , u@xmath23 is the root - mean - square velocity , @xmath24 is the mean rate of energy dissipation , @xmath11 and @xmath25 are the kolmogorov and taylor microscales , respectively , and @xmath26 , @xmath27 being the kinematic viscosity of air at the measurement temperature . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      the finite reynolds number of turbulence in numerical work shortens the inertial range over which scaling exponents may be discerned with clarity .",
    "this remains a constraint because the applicable theory concerns the limit of re @xmath28 .",
    "a constraint in experimental data is that some large - scale anisotropy might be present in the range that appears to scale .",
    "the effect could be present even in high - reynolds - number flows because the effects of anisotropic forcing penetrate the scaling range in a subtle but systematic way ; see , for example , @xcite .",
    "in numerical simulations , the statistics are usually calculated with the separation direction @xmath29 oriented parallel to a box - side .",
    "if there is residual anisotropy ( angular - dependence ) in the small - scales , this procedure will bias the results .",
    "since we are concerned here with delicate results , this uncertainty has to be eliminated satisfactorily .",
    "we make use of two recent developments to properly eliminate the effect of anisotropy in the inertial range of the @xmath30 data .",
    "first , we now know that isotropic and anisotropic contributions can be isolated systematically by projecting structure function of a given order over a particular basis function in its so(3 ) group decomposition ( e.g. , arad _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 , 1999 , kurien _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 , biferale & procaccia 2004 ) .",
    "this is a useful step to take even in nominally isotropic turbulence because the effect of forcing might persist in the nominal scaling range .",
    "second , taylor _ et al . _",
    "( 2003 ) developed a method by which the third - order longitudinal structure function was computed in @xmath31 directions of the flow for a given @xmath3 and the results averaged .",
    "the angle - averaged value of the structure function achieved the kolmogorov 4/5 prediction to a remarkable degree , thus providing a convincing scheme for extracting the isotropic component of a mildly anisotropic flow .",
    "the two procedures achieve the same goal : the angle - averaging procedure is in effect a projection on to the isotropic component of the so(3 ) rotation group .",
    "since this method is independent of the order of the structure function , we use it as described below for fractional statistics .    the angle - averaged isotropic structure function in the computational domain @xmath32",
    "is given by @xmath33 where the usual average for a particular direction of the unit separation vector @xmath29 is followed by a spherical average of all possible orientations of @xmath29 over the solid angle @xmath34 .",
    "the long - time average is taken in the steady state . in units of the large - eddy turnover time",
    ", @xmath35 is 1.5 from the start of the simulation and @xmath36 is unity .    in numerical simulations , since we have the full three - dimensional velocity field , we can in principle integrate over the sphere and project out the isotropic part of @xmath37 .",
    "_ showed that the full spherical average may be approximated to arbitrary precision by first computing the structure function over sufficiently many different directions in the flow , interpolating each of these functions by a simple single - variable cubic spline , and then averaging the interpolated values over all directions .",
    "this angle - averaging of the structure functions is much faster to implement than interpolating the three - dimensional , three - component velocity data over spherical shells in order to perform the integration .",
    "it is also more accurate in the small scales than other spherical averaging schemes .",
    "the angle - averaging procedure was performed for all orders .",
    "for very low - order moments @xmath38 we observed only marginal anisotropy in the inertial range and the statistics computed in the different directions nearly coincided with each other except for large scales @xmath39 . in figure [ fract_localslp ]",
    "we show the logarithmic derivative ( the local slope ) of the structure functions for various fractional orders .",
    "if the local slope is constant over a range of @xmath3 , it provides the scaling exponent @xmath40 .",
    "a rough estimate of the inertial range from figure  [ fract_localslp ] is @xmath41 and the error estimate on the value scaling exponent is calculated as the variance over this range . as expected , the smaller the absolute order @xmath42 , the more constant is the local slope , thus indicating that our confidence level improves as the moment order decreases .",
    "the scaling exponents and their uncertainty over the inertial range are given for a range of fractional orders in table  [ exponents ] , column 6 .",
    "the exponents calculated for all three datasets display a good degree of agreement .",
    "the scaling exponents computed in this way from the @xmath30 simulation are plotted as a function of order @xmath16 in figure [ fract_exps ] .",
    "for comparison , the k41 exponents are also shown .",
    "the measured exponents deviate from the k41 values for all orders .",
    "this shows that the intermittency , until now thought to be characteristic of only high - order moments , sampling ` fat ' tails of the pdf of velocity increments , persists into the low - order moments sampling the core of the pdf .",
    "figure [ d - fract_exps ] shows the difference @xmath43 from the k41 prediction as a function of @xmath16 . there is a linear approach to zero with a slope of 0.056 .",
    "equivalently , the behavior near zero is @xmath44 instead of @xmath45 .",
    "figure  [ relative_exps ] shows the relative ( percent ) departure of the measured scaling exponents from the self - similarity prediction of k41 , @xmath46 , is a smooth function of @xmath16 in the range @xmath47 ( figure  [ relative_exps ] ) .",
    "we have also presented the anomalous exponents calculated from the multifractal @xmath48-model ( meneveau & sreenivasan 1988 ) for comparison .",
    "the dependence on @xmath16 in the range @xmath49 is more or less linear and becomes weakly quadratic for @xmath50 .",
    "the exact @xmath51law result of k41 with scaling exponent 1 , takes the relative difference to zero at @xmath52 . a noteworthy point in this curve",
    "is at @xmath53 .",
    "the relative difference from k41 is not defined for @xmath53 but the experimental and model values go smoothly through zero .",
    "we interpret this to mean that anomalous scaling exists in the limit @xmath20 with relative departure from k41 of about @xmath54 ( see the @xmath55-intercept at @xmath53 in figure  [ relative_exps ] ) .",
    "the principal result of this paper is that the fractional low - order moments have scaling exponents that are different from @xmath15 . in this sense",
    ", it is reasonable to consider that anomaly exists in very low - order and negative moments .",
    "thus , instead of focusing entirely on high - order moments in search of an explanation for intermittency , it may also be reasonable to attempt to understand anomaly in low - order moments .",
    "this has the advantage that rare events , whose universality may be in some doubt , play far less of a role .",
    "we should remark on a lingering uncertainty . to keep structure functions real - valued for arbitrary orders , we can only consider , in the range @xmath19 , fractional moments of absolute valued velocity increments defined through equation ( [ sn_a ] ) .",
    "the difference between the structure functions defined in ( [ sn ] ) and the corresponding ones defined for absolute - valued velocity increments is by no means clear for large @xmath42 .",
    "our unpublished work appears to indicate that the absolute - valued structure functions have a larger scaling exponent than the classical ones when @xmath16 is large and odd .",
    "it can not therefore be dismissed entirely that the departures from @xmath15 that one may observe for small and fractional @xmath16 may merely suggest the possibility that k41 does not somehow apply to absolute moments . even if this is our only conclusion , it is still new and thus of some interest .",
