    "galaxy clusters promise great statistical power as a low redshift cosmological probe , if their masses are estimated accurately @xcite .",
    "a bias in the mass estimation poses the most serious challenge to the success of cluster cosmology .",
    "for example , the recently reported tension in cosmological inferences from the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and galaxy clusters measured by the planck satellite , the so - called ` planck cmb - cluster tension ' @xcite , may point to new physics , but it may also reflect the urgent need for better understanding and correction for systematic biases ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the most prominent astrophysical bias has to do with the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium ( hse ) of the intracluster medium ( icm ) inside the gravitational potential .",
    "hse no longer holds in the presence of non - thermal sources of pressure .",
    "hydrodynamical simulations show significant pressure associated with bulk and turbulent motions of the gas , which leads to a ` hse mass bias ' of order ten percent or more in the mass estimates of individual clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "as the amplitude of non - thermal pressure can hardly be measured directly by observations , one has to resort to theoretical estimations to correct for this bias .",
    "to this end , we have developed a physically motivated analytical model for non - thermal pressure in the icm ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sk14 hereafter ) . given the accretion history of the cluster , the model predicts the amplitude of non - thermal pressure and its radial , mass , and redshift dependencies .",
    "the model successfully reproduces the average non - thermal pressure profiles seen in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations @xcite , the average thermal pressure profile measured by planck @xcite , as well as non - thermal pressure profiles of _ individual _ clusters in hydrodynamical simulations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sknn15 hereafter ) .    in this paper",
    ", we study the ability of the sk14 model in correcting the hse mass estimation by testing it on simulated clusters in a set of high - resolution cosmological hydrodynamical simulations ( @xcite ) , with special attention paid to the dynamical state of galaxy clusters .",
    "the dynamical state of a cluster influences its mass estimation in two ways .",
    "first , the more dynamically relaxed a cluster is , the smaller its non - thermal pressure ( e.g. sk14 ; @xcite ) , and thus the smaller its hse mass bias .",
    "second , the cluster profiles are smoother when a cluster is dynamically more relaxed , which gives a better precision in the mass estimation .    in the early days , hse mass estimates were applied to clusters irrespective of their dynamical state ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these studies use x - ray surface brightness data and make the assumption that the icm is isothermal . after the recognition that gas temperature decreases systematically with increasing radius outside the cluster core region ,",
    "precise hse mass estimates require also spatially - resolved , high signal - to - noise gas temperature measurements , which are harder to obtain especially out to high redshifts .",
    "the current cluster mass estimates for a large sample of clusters are mostly performed statistically ( rather than individually ) using scaling relations between the mass and spatially - averaged observables , such as the mean x - ray temperature , luminosity , or their combination , and the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect @xcite averaged over certain cluster radii ( e.g. @xcite , see also @xcite for a review ) . in this context , hse mass estimates are usually performed only on a small sample of dynamically relaxed clusters where the bias from non - thermal pressure is minimized , and are used for observationally calibrating the scaling relations with the hope that the adopted scaling relation is robust against varying dynamical states ( which holds true for some scaling relations , see @xcite ) .",
    "however , even for relaxed clusters , non - thermal pressure is expected to be non - negligible because non - thermal motions are continuously sourced by the mass accretion and are never fully thermalized , especially at the cluster outskirts ( sk14 ; @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , it is important to study the correction of hse mass bias induced by non - thermal pressure for dynamically relaxed clusters .",
    "this is one of the primary goals of this paper .    in recent years ,",
    "the advances in sz observations make it possible to estimate hse masses using x - ray surface brightness combined with the gas pressure profiles probed by the sz effect , without the expensive x - ray temperature measurements .",
    "this will make individual cluster mass estimates for a large number of clusters possible out to high redshifts , and this time with high precision to large radii thanks to the relative insensitivity of the sz effect to gas density . in light of these observational advances ,",
    "another goal of this paper is to study the possibility of correcting hse mass bias for a population of clusters in a wide range of redshifts and dynamical states .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : we introduce our method of correcting non - thermal pressure in cluster mass estimation in sect.[sec : mass_method ] , where we discover the necessity of regulating the input cluster profiles by fitting or smoothing . then we present four methods for regularizing the profiles in sect.[sec : smoothing ] and [ sec : hsemethods ] and apply them to our simulated clusters . after introducing the way we select subsample of clusters based on their dynamical state in sect.[sec : dynstate ] , we present our results in sect.[sec : results ] and conclude in sect.[sec : conclusion ] . in the two appendices we study the effect of velocity anisotropy ( appendix[sec : anisotropy ] ) and how an error on the pressure profile propagates to an error on the mass ( appendix[app : massbias ] ) .",
    "the assumption of hse relates the thermal pressure @xmath0 that is observable from both x - ray and sz observations to the hydrostatic mass @xmath1 as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the gas density .",
    "since the total pressure in the icm , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is non - thermal pressure support , is greater than @xmath0 by definition , @xmath1 is an underestimate of the true mass .",
    "we thus define the ` corrected mass ' @xmath6 as , random motions producing @xmath5 need not be isotropic . while we have implicitly assumed the random motions to be isotropic here , we investigate the consequence of velocity anisotropy in appendix[sec : anisotropy ] . ]",
    "@xmath7 this @xmath6 is expected to be close to an unbiased estimate of the total mass when the non - thermal pressure support is the dominant source of the hse mass bias , as is the case found in hydrodynamical simulations at least for regions within @xmath8 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "solving for @xmath13 using equation ( [ eq : mhse ] ) or ( [ eq : mcorr ] ) is equivalent to finding the corresponding radius @xmath9 from a spherically - averaged ` overdensity ' profile defined by @xmath14 with the implicit relation @xmath15 . here , @xmath16 is either @xmath0 or @xmath17 .",

    "@xcite , an eulerian hydrodynamic cosmological simulation .",
    "radiative cooling , star formation and feedback are not included in the current runs of the omega500 simulation .",
    "these additional physics are crucial for reproducing the observed behaviors of cluster cores .",
    "they also affect the detailed shapes of the thermo - dynamical profiles in the bulk of icm , especially for low mass systems . for low mass clusters and galaxy groups , testing non - thermal",
    "pressure and cluster mass estimations would be better performed with simulations with cooling and feedback .",
    "however , these additional physics do not change the overall shape of the icm profiles outside the cluster core ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , the velocity dispersion of the gas and fraction of non - thermal pressure at around @xmath24 are consistent to typically @xmath2510% between simulations with and without cooling and feedback @xcite even for clusters with relatively low masses @xmath26(corresponding to @xmath27 ) @xcite .",

    "we refer to sect.2 of sknn15 and references therein for further descriptions of the simulation and the cluster sample used in this paper .",
    "small clumps have been removed when constructing the one - dimensional cluster profiles by excluding high - density tail in the probability distribution of gas densities using the @xcite method .",
    "we first compute the overdensity profile @xmath18 from simulated profiles with equation ( [ eq : deltaprof ] ) , taking @xmath28 for @xmath1 and @xmath29 for @xmath6 .",

    "we compute @xmath33 of each cluster using the sk14 model and the mass accretion history of the cluster measured from the simulation ( see sknn15 for details ) .",
    "numerically calculating a cluster mass using equation  ( [ eq : deltaprof ] ) is not trivial , as taking derivative of pressure and dividing by density would amplify small - scale structures and noise . if we apply no regulation of the simulated profiles other than a cubic - spline interpolation when computing the derivative of the pressure profile , the resulting overdensity profile will be far from smooth ( dashed lines in fig.[fig : r500c_est ] ) , despite that the gas density and pressure profiles are rather smooth after clumps are removed . in the previous x - ray studies ,",
    "the observed gas density and temperature profiles are often fit to parametric models to reduce this noise ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "non - parametric smoothing methods have also been adopted in simulation studies @xcite .",
    "here we use and compare four approaches : one based on cubic spline smoothing , and the others based on fitting pressure and density to different parametrized models . for the parametrized models , we further compare two fitting ranges .",
    "first , we compute the overdensity profile ( equation [ eq : deltaprof ] ) from simulated gas density and pressure profiles with cubic spline interpolation applied to pressure when taking a derivative , @xmath34 .",
    "we then smooth the computed @xmath35 profile with a cubic - spline smoothing algorithm described in @xcite .",
    "the algorithm fits the data points with a piece - wise cubic spline with an increasing number of nodes , until the input constraint on the value of @xmath36 statistic is satisfied .",
    "we use the constraint that @xmath36 divided by the number of degrees of freedom is less than 0.04 .",
    "this constraint is chosen to minimize the variance of @xmath37 while not biasing the sample mean .    when estimating @xmath30 with the smoothing method , a large radial range of data around the true @xmath24 is needed to guarantee that the estimated @xmath38 profile covers @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , we apply this method only to rather relaxed clusters using data on the radial range of [ 0.1 , 1.5 ] @xmath39 .",
    "next , we fit parametrized models to the pressure and gas density profiles and estimate masses .",
    "we fit pressure rather than temperature because pressure is the quantity that directly enters the hse and corrected mass estimation . also , thermal pressure is the quantity that the thermal sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect @xcite directly probes , so fitting gas density and pressure may be a better option when applying to combined sz and x - ray data .",
    "the data points used in the fit are equally spaced logarithmic bins with uniform weighting on the radial range of either [ 0.1 , 1 ] @xmath40 or [ 0.1 , 1.5 ] @xmath39 .",
    "these are the typical radial ranges of the currently available data on well - resolved clusters used for the mass calibration .",
    "we first use the model presented in @xcite , which is based on an isothermal @xmath41 model @xcite with modifications capturing the cool cores and the observed steepening of the gas density profile at large radii . here",
    "we ignore the modification for the cool cores , both because cool cores are non - existent in our simulated clusters , and that our focus is on the outer region of the clusters , especially around @xmath24 where we determine their masses .",
    "the resulting simplified model is : @xmath42 and @xmath43 following @xcite , we fix @xmath44 . after this",
    ", this model still has 10 parameters ( including 2 for normalization ) , and is highly nonlinear , suggesting the possible existence of local minima in the @xmath36 function .    for all the parametrized models",

    "the vikhlinin model was designed to fit gas density and temperature of the icm .",
    "it is then not surprising that the fitting form for the pressure ( equation[eq : vikp ] ) is rather redundant .",

    "for this cluster , the fits to the gas density and _ total _ pressure profiles ( i.e. , corrected for non - thermal pressure ) give an overdensity profile ( blue solid line ) that agrees very well with the true one ( black solid line ) .",
    "this suggests that at least for this cluster , the nfw assumption works and this model provides a good fit to the simulated profile .",
    "recently , @xcite developed an automatic method for classifying the relaxation state of galaxy clusters .",
    "their classification is based on the symmetry ( ` s ' ) , peakiness ( ` p ' ) , and alignment ( ` a ' ) of their x - ray morphologies , similar to the factors we consider for our classification ( sect.[sec : dynstate ] ) .",

    "this results in a relaxed cluster fraction of about 16% , slightly smaller than the fraction ( 21% ) of our ` rather relaxed ' clusters ( blue circles and the green star in @xcite ) . in general , more relaxed clusters in our simulated sample",

    "this is likely due to the inability of non - radiative simulations in reproducing the observed properties of the cluster core .",
    "after taking the corresponding shifted @xmath66-@xmath67-@xmath68 criterion into consideration , the distribution of @xmath66-@xmath67-@xmath68 values of our ` rather relaxed ' clusters aligns rather well with that of the relaxed clusters as classified with @xcite method ."
