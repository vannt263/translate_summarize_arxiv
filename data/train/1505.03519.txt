    "prominent examples include ultracold atomic gases @xcite , organic conductors @xcite and nanotubes @xcite . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", one - dimensional systems are very appealing , for a number of reasons .",
    "firstly , there are a number of exactly solvable models in one spatial dimension .",
    "examples include those models solved via the bethe ansatz technique @xcite , such as the spinless bose gas with dirac delta interactions ( lieb - liniger model ) @xcite and its spin-1/2 fermionic counterpart @xcite , and models with unbroken susy , which admit jastrow - product ground state wave functions , such as sutherland s model with inverse - square interactions and variations thereof @xcite .",
    "more recently , strongly - coupled mesoscopic multicomponent systems in arbitrary external potentials have been the subject of intense investigation @xcite .",
    "moreover , some numerical methods work especially well for one - dimensional systems . for instance",
    ", the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) @xcite is extremely powerful and flexible to use in most one - dimensional many - body problems on a lattice .",
    "the low - energy properties of many of the above systems can be described by the universality class of luttinger liquids @xcite . in brief , the properties of these systems , such as the collective excitation spectrum , correlation functions , or density of states , at energies close to the fermi energy , exhibit universal behaviour that is described by the exact solution of tomonaga - luttinger s model @xcite via bosonization @xcite .",
    "for instance , the density of states behaves as a power law , where the exponent and the proportionality constant are the only microscopic , non - universal details , around the fermi points @xcite .    historically , there are two fundamentally different , yet complementary approaches for the introduction of luttinger liquid phenomenological models for one - dimensional quantum gases .",
    "the first one , called constructive bosonisation @xcite , naturally arises for fermionic systems upon linearisation of the kinetic energy dispersion , as introduced by tomonaga @xcite . the second ,",
    "more phenomenological , and also more general approach , is field - theoretical bosonisation , introduced by haldane @xcite .    in this article , we consider one - dimensional spinless fermi gases in the fermionic luttinger liquid regime , that is , when their low - energy behaviour can be modelled by luttinger s model .",
    "we will follow the constructive , rather than the field - theoretical route , which is most convenient for weakly - interacting fermions .",
    "in particular , we study the microscopic origin of the interaction coupling constants in luttinger s model .",
    "we first address the main forward - scattering channel in the microscopic theory , corresponding to the collision of two fermions with incident momenta close to the two opposite fermi points . in the very weak - coupling regime , these interbranch processes are well understood , and we show how to renormalise luttinger s interbranch interaction in favour of scattering data ( i.e. the two - body phase shift ) . from our analysis of the interbranch collision channel ,",
    "we show how luttinger s model naturally arises from tomonaga s model upon renormalisation of the fermi points , which are to be considered as bare parameters of the theory . in this way",
    ", we also explain the reason behind the interbranch coupling constant remaining `` unrenormalised '' in luttinger s model , a well known fact , as opposed to tomonaga s model , where the theory requires non - trivial renormalisation .",
    "we then consider intrabranch interactions , i.e. interactions between particles moving in the same direction . in this case",
    ", symmetry dictates that the intrabranch coupling constant must be identical to the interbranch one @xcite .",
    "however , the current understanding of the microscopic origin of the intrabranch interaction in luttinger s model is quite unsatisfactory .",
    "usually @xcite , its origin is said to be linked to the forward scattering of fermions near the same fermi point , i.e. in the same branch . even though this picture sounds reasonable , and easy to grasp physically",
    ", it has some major issues . here , we carefully illustrate these issues , and find that the effective _",
    "intra_branch interaction in luttinger s model corresponds , in the microscopic fermionic model , to an energy shift due to _ inter_branch interactions .",
    "we finally apply our results in order to obtain the luttinger s parameter and the speed of excitations in the tonks - girardeau regime @xcite of the lieb - liniger gas , corresponding to the weak - coupling limit of its fermionic dual @xcite .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath0 non - relativistic spinless fermions of mass @xmath1 interacting via pairwise potentials @xmath2 in one spatial dimension ( 1d ) .",
    "the hamiltonian in the first quantisation has the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the position of the @xmath5-th particle . in the momentum representation ,",
    "the two - body interaction is given by @xmath6 where we have defined @xmath7 .",
    "with this notation , we can write down the second - quantised hamiltonian in the momentum representation , @xmath8 above , @xmath9 is the single - particle kinetic energy dispersion , @xmath10 is the system s size , @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) annihilates ( creates ) a fermion with momentum @xmath13 , and therefore satisfies canonical anticommutation relations @xmath14 in hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonianmomentum ] ) we have assumed periodic boundary conditions , that is , @xmath15 with @xmath16 being integer numbers .",
    "since we are working with fermions , it is convenient to introduce even and odd wave components in the interaction as @xmath17 .",
    "the even ( odd ) wave component , acting only on bosonic ( fermionic ) wave functions , sometimes called `` s - wave '' ( `` p - wave '' ) , is given by the following symmetric ( antisymmetric ) combination @xmath18,\\\\ v_p(k , k')&=\\frac{1}{2}\\left[v(k , k')-v(k ,- k')\\right].\\label{pwave}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the following , we will use @xmath19 or @xmath20 at our discretion , depending on whichever is more convenient in each situation .",
    "in many applications , it is advantageous to construct effective interactions that mimic the exact scattering properties of a system at the relevant energy scales .",
    "this can greatly simplify the calculations while keeping a correct description of collisional processes , and allow for universal ( i.e. independent of microscopic details ) predictions of many quantities of interest .",
    "for instance , low - energy scattering is adequately described by means of `` pionless '' effective field theory ( eft ) @xcite , in which the interaction is taylor - expanded around @xmath21 as @xmath22 the lowest - order contribution to the p - wave potential above is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the bare coupling constant that is to be renormalised in favour of low - energy scattering data .    in this article",

    "the intrabranch coupling constant , typically denoted by @xmath117 @xcite , is very simple to obtain as a function of the interbranch coupling constant , since it must obey a natural physical constrain , corresponding to the conservation of charge ( particle number ) @xcite . in our notation",

    "however , the understanding of the microscopic origin of @xmath117 is far from satisfactory , and we study this in detail in this section .",
    "it is customary to consider intrabranch interactions as two - particle scattering processes @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - g4 ] ) , and then use a phenomenological coupling constant , namely @xmath117 , that simply adds to the fermi velocity and renormalises the bosonic excitation energies in the luttinger liquid @xcite .",
    "there are , however , several problems associated with this collisional interpretation of intrabranch processes .",
    "firstly , before linearising the single - particle dispersion , one can define two - fermion scattering states in , say , the right - moving branch ( we will consider right - moving fermions throughout this section unless otherwise stated ) . since the relevant scattering processes occur around the fermi point , the energy at which one should renormalise the interactions should be twice the fermi energy @xmath119 .",
    "however , the fermionic @xmath37-matrix ( ergo the phase shift ) tends to zero quadratically with relative momentum , see eq .",
    "( [ v4 ] ) .",
    "this would mean that the renormalised fermi velocity would not be changed to zero - th order in the momentum of excitations , contrary to well - known results and phenomenology @xcite .",
    "the second , even more severe problem , is that even if we wanted to renormalise the scattering properties in the linearised approximation to match the exact scattering properties ( obtained using the full quadratic dispersion ) around the fermi point , we would simply not be able to do so .",
    "the fact , seemingly unnoticed so far , is that two particles ( fermions or bosons ) in the same branch of a linearised dispersion do not scatter .",
    "we begin by considering this issue in the following subsection .",
    "consider the lippmann - schwinger equation off the energy shell @xmath120 in the relative coordinate , @xmath121 where @xmath44 is regarded here as a fermionic ( antisymmetric ) state , that is @xmath122 .",
    "as we go on - shell , @xmath123 , we see that the principal value @xmath37-matrix must vanish linearly with @xmath57",
    ". therefore , we define @xmath124 for @xmath123 .",

( [ opeq ] ) reduces to @xmath132 for a strict finite - range potential @xmath19 ( which we can always consider as a good approximation ) , most of its eigenvalues will be degenerate and equal to zero .",

    "( [ projector ] ) is that our system ( or any other flat - banded system ) only supports scattering states if the potential has at least one vanishing eigenvalue .",
