    "complex non - equilibrium phenomena have lured the attention of a large part of the physical community in recent years . despite the knotty character of this type of systems , by applying particular techniques , it has been possible to make a physical characterization of their leading properties . among these techniques ,",
    "let us mention the `` superstatistical '' approach .",
    "it originated from the observation , in the context of nuclear collisions , that deviations from the standard ( exponential ) probability density function ( pdf ) could be explained through the fluctuations of an inner parameter , in that case , the cross section  @xcite . because a statistics is made up of another statistics , this approach became known as superstatistics , or statistics of statistics .",
    "therafter , it was further generalised , endowed with a statistical mechanics interpretation  @xcite and widely applied since then .",
    "in fact , for many systems , it is realistic to consider that some of the characteristic parameters may be not strictly constant , but instead fluctuant , either in time or in space , according to a specific pdf , in a scale much larger than the primary stochastic process .",
    "the superstatistical approach has been quite successful in accounting for observations in fluid turbulence  @xcite , physiology  @xcite , human activities  @xcite , ecology  @xcite , and also in finance  @xcite , amid many others .",
    "let us also point out that , in economics and social sciences , albeit _ ad - hoc _ , statistical mixtures have been taken into account for some decades  @xcite .",
    "in this work , we consider as primary process the one given by the stochastic differential equation ( sde ) @xmath0 \\,dt+\\delta \\,\\sqrt{x}\\,dw_{t},\\quad \\left ( x\\geq 0\\right ) ,   \\label{sde}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 represents a standard wiener process , with unitary variance , and @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are positive real parameters .",
    "this sde , first studied by feller  @xcite , is well - known in mathematical finance .",
    "it was employed by cox , ingersoll and ross to model short - term interest rates  @xcite and later became popular in mimicking stochastic volatility , like in the heston model for price dynamics  @xcite .",
    "mean - reverting square - root diffusion has also been considered in other contexts , such as in modelling neural spiking  @xcite or in problems of biological diffusion  @xcite .    still in the context of finance , in the first approximation , eq .",
    "( [ sde ] ) describes the dynamics of share trading volumes , although the tails of the empirical distributions deviate from the steady solution associated with the sde ( [ sde ] ) , @xmath5 which is the gamma pdf  @xcite , with @xmath6 a normalization constant .",
    "fluctuations that can explain the observed deviations within the superstatistical mixing framework  @xcite have been detected in the parameter directly related to the mean value  @xcite .",
    "the resulting pdf , known as @xmath7-gamma , is a generalization of the gamma distribution that can be cast into the form of the @xmath8-distribution and which basically turns the exponential tail into a power - law one .",
    "it has been shown to be in excellent agreement with empirical observations at different granularity timescales ( from 1 min to days )  @xcite .",
    "the study of complex systems often encompasses the analysis of the probability function of the addition of stochastic observables , mostly to appraise the hypothesis of scale invariance .",
    "precisely , in respect of this , the fact that the description of empirical volume pdfs in terms of @xmath7-gamma distributions applies at different aggregation scales is particularly interesting , especially because , unlike the gamma distribution , the @xmath7-gamma is neither closed under convolution nor correlations can be fully neglected .    to understand these observations",
    "motivates the present work .",
    "although our initial motivation comes from an econophysical problem , the present results may be of interest for a wider scenario where linear diffusion applies , as soon as parameter fluctuations are ubiquitous .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows .",
    "we first summarize the pertinent results related to the fokker - planck equation ( fpe ) associated to the stochastic process ( [ sde ] ) .",
    "we apply these results to obtain the pdfs resulting from an accumulation process . thereafter , we apply the statistical composition procedure , in which the reverting mean is the fluctuating parameter .",
    "we obtain joint distributions that us allow to characterize the correlation structure as well as the aggregation properties .",
    "finally , we apply the analytical results to interpret the granular features of real time - series of trading volumes .",

    "( [ sde ] ) , is only an auxiliary quantity .",

    "is ruled by a different mechanism  @xcite , it was not considered in fitting procedures .    in order to model the empirical distribution of the 1-hour traded volume , through eq .",
    "( [ pmv ] ) , we used the values of the parameters resulting from the numerical adjustment of the @xmath142-minute traded volume pdf , together with the value of @xmath76 obtained from the adjustment of the linear auto - correlation function with an exponential decay .",
    "although the exponential does not describe well the correlations in long - term regimes , it can be considered as a good approximation for the short timescales of interest .",
    "from which we appraised @xmath163 , since the characteristic exponential time decay was @xmath164 min and we adopted @xmath142 min as the time unit .    once obtained the values of parameters @xmath165 , we compared the @xmath147-hour traded volume empirical pdf ( symbols ) with eq .",
    "( [ pmv ] ) ( full curve ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bovespa](b ) .",
    "we observe a fair agreement between them ( @xmath166 ) , specially recalling that very small volumes should not be considered .",
    "however , notice that a simple non - linear @xmath7-gamma adjustment ( dotted line ) provides also a very good description , with parameters @xmath167 [ @xmath152 , @xmath168 , @xmath169 ( dotted curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : bovespa](b ) ) .",
    "this illustrates once more how the @xmath7-gamma model , although approximate , appears to hold at different aggregation scales .",
    "furthermore , the fitting we present fails to reject the null hypothesis for the pearson s statistical test with @xmath170 .",
    "notice also that although correlations are not completely negligible at these timescales , they do not play an important role in the resulting pdf , which is very close to the one that would be obtained by assuming independence ( gray long - dashed line ) .",
    "it is remarkable that , volumes for a company in a developed market , recorded at high frequency , as pfe , display the same qualitative features , despite correlations are stronger at those ( high frequency ) time - scales ( not shown , however , as illustration see ref .",
    "in particular , from @xmath7-gamma fitting , an almost constant value of @xmath106 is observed at the different scales . moreover , pfe ( in 2004 ) , as well as the top 10 nasdaq and nyse stock volumes ( in 2001 ) respectively display @xmath171 4 , 4 and 3 , while @xmath171 7 - 8 for the brazilian market , indicating a lower degree of inhomogeneities in the former case .",
    "then @xmath106 constitutes an index to detect and quantify the level of inhomogeneities of a market or period .",
    "from the time - dependent pdf of the sde describing mean - reverting square - root diffusion , we derived the two - point ( two - time ) joint pdf in the steady state , as well as the pdf of the addition of variables generated according to this dynamical process .",
    "we further considered a scenario in which the mean reverting term presents fluctuations that can be introduced twofold : they correspond to variations of the parameter either over runs or within the same run in a time scale much larger than the scale needed for the system to reach stationarity .",
    "although our survey was mainly inspired by previous empirical findings of inhomogeneities in the traded volume flow corroborating a gamma - gamma phenomenological proposal , we uphold that a similar approach might be applied on the study of systems exhibiting inhomogeneous occurrence of poisson events  @xcite or simply on problems for which the @xmath7-gamma distribution has shown to be statistically relevant like in granular media  @xcite .",
    "we have also discussed paradoxical results related to the non - commutativity of averaging and mixing operations .    in both limits of full independence ( @xmath18 ) and",
    "full dependence ( @xmath172 ) , the pdf of the sum of consecutive variables is a @xmath7-gamma distribution . we have shown that in intermediate situations , for arbitrary degree of correlations , the upshot of aggregation at different scales is also well - described by that distribution , although not the exact one .",
    "moreover , while the increase at the origin is ruled by the independence behavior , the tail is governed by the degree of inhomogeneities which manifest at any aggregation scale . then the @xmath7-gamma form is approximately preserved .",
    "we would like to stress that the model we have introduced explains why _",
    "i ) _ even for @xmath173 , the exponent @xmath153 of the associated pdf increases by increasing the number of added variables as well ; _ ii ) _ the tail exponent , which may be considered and indicator and quantifier of the presence of inhomogeneities , is preserved at different scales .    we have shown that all this scenario applies in the specific case of traded volume within periods of regular trading behavior ( _ i.e. _ , absence of bubbles / crashes ) which represent the majority of the trading history .",
    "nonetheless , for the fallout of stock market crashes , a further survey based on appropriate data that bridges the trading volume dynamics with the occurrence of extreme episodes ( namely allowing for the theory of log - oscillations  @xcite ) is of manifest interest for an all - inclusive comprehension of financial markets dynamics .",
    "especially , it would be interesting to understand the relation between the theory of log - oscillations and possible modifications in the description of the degree of inhomogeneities in a market ( fluctuations in @xmath3 ) that are depicted by the parameter @xmath174 during most of the trading records .",
