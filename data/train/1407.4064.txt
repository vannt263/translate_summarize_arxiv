    "we have exhibited a class of lattice models with gauge and matter degrees of freedom in two dimensions .",
    "we studied the vertex excitations in these models and showed that they obey non - abelian fusion rules for @xmath5 .",
    "this was seen through three examples namely @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath14 .",
    "the latter two were shown to host the familiar ising anyons and the anyons of the @xmath100 quantum double model .",
    "these models are thus examples of systems which are not quantum double models but host non - abelian anyons as part of their low energy excitations .",
    "these models were originally constructed from transfer matrices built using a procedure similar to the one used in  @xcite .",
    "this construction is quiet elaborate and needs more space and so we will present this is in a separate paper  @xcite . in other words",
    "these can be thought of as generalizations of  @xcite where we use kuperberg invariants to build transfer matrices for lattice gauge theories based on involutary hopf algebras .",
    "in particular the hamiltonians constructed out of these transfer matrices contained the quantum double hamiltonians for particular choices of parameters  @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this formalism is that it allows us to study a wide range of models in the parameter space and thus helps understand phase transitions between topologically ordered and non - topological phases .",
    "a similar study can be carried out for theories with gauge and matter fields  @xcite .",
    "this helps us obtain a variety of models .",
    "in particular we can obtain kitaev s honeycomb models when we consider @xmath117 as our input .",
    "the models presented in this paper can be thought of as conceptual generalizations of the kitaev honeycomb model  @xcite which are known to host ising anyons when magnetic fields are added to the system .",
    "the non - abelian phase of the kitaev honeycomb model is suitable for quantum computation as the braid group , acting on the excitations of the low energy sector in the theory , is not superselected .",
    "that is it does not commute with the operators creating the excitations in the theory .",
    "this is crucial to realize quantum gates using the non - abelian anyons as now we can experimentally probe the statistics of these particles .",
    "the @xmath15 model also has this feature and thus maybe suitable for quantum computation .",
    "we plan to explore this aspect of this problem in a future work .",
    "we believe that for all @xmath5 these models host non - abelian vertex excitations",
    ". it will be interesting to find appropriate @xmath1 and @xmath4 for a given set of anyonic fusion rules .",
    "we did not study the braiding of these excitations .",
    "this is however easy to achieve as we have the operators creating the excitations and thus they can be used to move these particles .",
    "lattice models for topological insulators can be constructed using a procedure similar to  @xcite for appropriate choice of gauge groups and their modules .",
    "this formalism will thus help in studying the parameter space of theories with gauge and matter fields and so can possibly help in studying transitions between normal and topological insulators .",
    "we will explore these problems in future works .",

    "<S> we demonstrate the emergence of non - abelian fusion rules for excitations of a two dimensional lattice model built out of abelian degrees of freedom . it can be considered as an extension of the usual toric code model on a two dimensional lattice augmented with matter fields . </S>",

    "<S> the matter part is described by a @xmath1 dimensional vector space which we call @xmath2 . </S>",

    "<S> the vertex excitations for this model are studied and shown to obey non - abelian fusion rules . </S>",
    "<S> we will show this for specific values of @xmath1 and @xmath4 , though we believe this feature holds for all @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we will see that non - abelian anyons of the quantum double of @xmath6 are obtained as part of the vertex excitations of the model with @xmath7 and @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> ising anyons are obtained in the model with @xmath9 and @xmath10 . the @xmath11 and @xmath10 case is also worked out as this is the simplest model exhibiting non - abelian fusion rules . </S>",
    "<S> another common feature shared by these models is that the ground states have a higher symmetry than @xmath3 . </S>",
