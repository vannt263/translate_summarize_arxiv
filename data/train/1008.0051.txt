    "the addition of small amounts of polymers to a turbulent fluid leads to dramatic changes that include modifications of the small - scale properties of the flow  @xcite and , in wall - bounded flows , the phenomenon of drag reduction  @xcite , in which polymer additives allow the maintenance of a given flow rate at a lower pressure gradient than is required without these additives .",
    "several experimental , numerical , and analytical studies have investigated drag reduction  @xcite in wall - bounded flows .",
    "these studies have shown that the addition of polymers modifies the turbulence significantly in the region near the wall ; and this leads to an increase in the mean velocity in the bulk .",
    "by contrast , there have been only some investigations of the effects of polymer additives on homogeneous , isotropic turbulence .",
    "examples include recent experiments  @xcite , which have been designed to obtain a high degree of isotropy in the turbulent flow , and shell - model studies and direct numerical simulations ( dns )  @xcite .",
    "these studies have shown that the addition of polymers to a turbulent flow leads to a considerable reduction in small - scale structures ; and they have also discovered the phenomenon of dissipation reduction , namely , a reduction in the energy dissipation rate @xmath0 , in decaying turbulence  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we first elucidate the phenomenon of dissipation reduction for the case of statistically steady , homogeneous , isotropic turbulence with polymer additives ; we then study the small - scale properties of such flows .",
    "we do this by conducting a series of high - resolution dns studies of the three - dimensional navier - stokes equation coupled to an equation for the polymer conformation tensor , which describes the polymer additives at the level of the fene - p  @xcite model . before we give the details of our study , it is useful to summarise our principal results ; these are in two parts .",
    "the first part contains results from our dns of forced , statistically steady , fluid turbulence , with polymer additives , at moderate reynolds numbers ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the forcing is chosen such that the energy injected into the fluid remains fixed  @xcite , both with and without polymers ; this mimics the forcing scheme used in the experiments of ref .",
    "we find that , on the addition of polymers , the energy in the statistically steady state and the energy - dissipation rate are reduced .",
    "this dissipation reduction increases with an increase in the polymer concentration @xmath2 at fixed weissenberg number @xmath3 , the ratio ( see table  [ tablech3:para ] ) of the polymer time scale @xmath4 to a shearing time scale in the turbulent fluid .",
    "the dissipation reduction also increases with @xmath3 if we hold @xmath2 fixed . the dissipation reduction seen in our simulations",
    "should not be confused with the phenomenon of drag reduction seen in wall - bounded flows . in the fluid energy spectrum",
    "we find that the energy content increases marginally at small wavevectors on the addition of polymers , but it decreases for intermediate wavevectors .",
    "in this part of our study we use @xmath5 collocation points and attain a moderate reynolds numbers @xmath1 ; but we do not resolve the deep - dissipation range .",
    "( we consider the deep dissipation range in the following paragraph . )",
    "we also obtain the structural properties of the fluid with and without polymers and show that polymers suppress large - vorticity and large - strain events ; our results here are in qualitative agreement with the experiments of ref .",
    "furthermore , we find , as in our study of decaying turbulence  @xcite , that the polymer extension increases with an increase in the polymer relaxation time @xmath4 .",
    "we compare our results , e.g. , those for the energy spectrum , with their counterparts in our earlier study of decaying fluid turbulence with polymer additives  @xcite .",
    "in such comparisons , we use averages over the statistically steady state of our system here ; and , for the case of decaying turbulence , we use data obtained at the cascade - completion time , at which a plot of the energy dissipation rate versus time displays a maximum .",
    "in the second part of our study we carry out the highest - resolution dns , attempted so far , of forced , statistically steady , fluid turbulence with polymer additives ; we drive the fluid by an external , stochastic force as in ref .",
    "this part of our study has been designed to uncover the effects of polymers on the deep - dissipation range , so the reynolds numbers is small ( @xmath6 ) . by comparing fluid energy spectra , with and without polymers ,",
    "we find that the polymers suppress the energy in the dissipation range but increase it in the deep - dissipation range .",
    "finally , we calculate the second - order velocity structure function @xmath7 directly from the energy spectrum via a fourier transformation ; this shows that @xmath7 with polymers is smaller than @xmath7 without polymers in this range .",
    "the remaining part of this paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec : mode ] we present the equations we use for the polymer solution and describe , in subsection  [ sec : nsch ] , the method we use for the numerical integration of these equations .",
    "section  [ results ] is devoted to a discussion of our results ; as we have mentioned above , these are divided into two parts ; the first part is contained in subsections  [ sub : eeps]-[sub : ss1 ] and the second in subsection  [ sub : ekn512 ] .",
