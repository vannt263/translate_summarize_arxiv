    "percolation theory and its many applications to physical phenomena does not require a lengthy introduction @xcite .",
    "percolation theory describes how the response of a system changes upon removal of its elements or of the connections between these constituents .",
    "once enough elements have been removed and the percolation threshold is approached , the system displays critical behavior characterized by universal exponents and scaling functions .",
    "the percolation threshold itself that is , the point where there is the flimsiest of connections between one side of the system and the other following a fractal path of surviving elements depends both on the dimensionality of the system and on the number of neighbors in the undiluted lattice@xcite .",
    "many critical phenomena have now been mapped@xcite onto a percolation problem .",
    "+ in this paper we investigate the behavior of systems where the removal of its constituents has been restricted in the sense that we only remove elements from the cluster that spans the width of the system .",
    "normally , elements can be removed from all occupied sites , not merely from the cluster that spans the lattice .",
    "we show that such a restriction not only shifts the percolation threshold , it also changes the powerlaws that characterize the critical behavior of the system .",
    "an example of such a powerlaw is how the infinite cluster @xmath0 loses elements in the vicinity of the percolation threshold @xmath1 : @xmath2 with @xmath3 and @xmath4 the fraction of occupied ( or surviving ) lattice sites .",
    "+ an important consequence of the above restriction is that the number of clusters present in the system upon approaching the percolation threshold no longer increases exponentially when compared to the unrestricted percolation scenario . while the number of isolated clusters still increases because more and more sites are removed from the lattice spanning cluster , allowing for smaller clusters to peel off , the ever increasing numbers of isolated clusters are not allowed to subdivide further .",
    "this changes the critical powerlaw behavior present in standard percolative systems into analytic behavior in our restricted case .",
    "+ when the number of isolated clusters no longer diverges upon approaching the percolation threshold , then the harris criterion @xcite is violated . whenever the criterion is satisfied , then we can expect that impurities will not end up determining the critical behavior of a system .",
    "in contrast , when the criterion is violated , then impurities can not be disregarded .",
    "as such , our restricted percolation model should prove to be an ideal model system for studying the influence of impurities on critical behavior .",
    "+ we detail our modified percolation model in the next section where we will derive the relationship ( between the restricted and unrestricted cases ) for the critical exponent governing the demise of the lattice spanning cluster upon approaching @xmath1",
    ". we also present the results of monte carlo computer simulations in that section to support our claims . in the last section of this paper",
    "we show that the onset of magnetic order in chemically substituted kondo lattice systems represents a practical realization of a restricted percolative system .",
    "this identification , together with its implicit violation of the harris criterion , opens the door for a much better understanding of the ordering tendencies of chemically doped quantum critical systems whose response has , thus far @xcite , eluded theoretical description .",
    "in standard percolation , we start off with a fully occupied lattice , and then we remove lattice sites at random . when more and more sites are removed , a situation is reached where individual sites or groups of sites ( clusters ) become isolated from the main group of sites that spans the lattice , the so - called lattice spanning or infinite cluster . upon removal of more sites , we will reach the point where the infinite cluster breaks up .",
    "this point is called the percolation threshold , and denoted by @xmath1 ; the critical concentration @xmath4 of lattice sites below which we can not find a cluster that connects one side of the lattice to the opposite side .",
    "the percolation threshold depends on the dimensionality of the system , as well as on the number of neighbors @xmath5 that any site is connected to .",
    "+ the behavior of certain quantities , such as the number of occupied sites @xmath6 that are part of the infinite cluster or the number of isolated clusters in the system @xmath7 , displays a powerlaw dependence when measured as a function of how far the system is removed from the percolation threshold .",
    "for instance , the strength of the infinite cluster close to the percolation threshold can be expressed as @xmath8 the argument @xmath9 is a measure of how far the system is removed from the percolation threshold , and the exponent @xmath10 is called the critical exponent .",
    "the critical exponents depend on the dimensionality of the system , but not on the underlying details such as the number of nearest neighbors . given the unimportance of such details ,",
    "these exponents are referred to as universal exponents , and we lump groups of systems together into universality classes characterized by a particular set of exponents .",
    "+ when we restrict the removal of sites to only allow sites to be removed from the infinite cluster , we obviously change the percolation threshold .",
    "after all , when we only remove sites from the infinite cluster , every site removal will serve to weaken the infinite cluster and we should reach the percolation threshold quicker , meaning that @xmath11 . however , this shift in percolation threshold by itself does not necessarily imply a change in universal exponent .",
    "nonetheless , the following straightforward argument demonstrates that the restricted model should have different critical exponents , and , therefore , that we will have a different universality class .",
    "+ in standard percolation when a fraction of sites @xmath4 are still occupied , while a fraction @xmath6 sites form the infinite cluster , on average it will take @xmath12 site removals to remove just one site from the infinite cluster . in our restricted percolation scenario , it requires only one site removal to remove a site from the infinite cluster .",
    "close to the percolation threshold , the strength of the infinite cluster @xmath6 will rapidly diminish , necessitating increasingly more site removals in the unrestricted scenario before the infinite cluster is affected again .",
    "it is this increasingly more part , captured by the @xmath12 dependence , that changes the critical exponent .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ pintro ] .",
    "+     is changed by @xmath13 ( vertical lines ) at every site removal .",
    "the dashed horizontal lines signify identical morphologies for @xmath14 and @xmath6 . for standard percolation ( left ) , there can be changes in occupancy @xmath4 that do not result in any change in membership of the infinite cluster ; such non - changes occur when sites are removed from isolated clusters .",
    "on average , it takes @xmath15 steps to remove a site from the infinite cluster in standard percolation versus only one step in restricted percolation .",
    "this can be seen to result in a change of the slope of the powerlaw that describes the evolution of the infinite clusters ( black solid lines ) .",
    "the situation shown here where it takes 18 steps to accomplish in the standard percolation scenario what only takes 7 steps to accomplish in the restricted percolation scenario would correspond to @xmath16 when @xmath17 . ]    in addition , we can argue that the number of isolated clusters does not display a powerlaw behavior close to the percolation threshold under the restricted scenario . in standard percolation",
    ", clusters peel from off the infinite cluster .",
    "however , these clusters are allowed to break up further , increasing the total number of clusters .",
    "the closer one gets to the percolation threshold , the more and more sites will be removed from finite clusters as opposed to the infinite cluster , simply because sites slated for removal are picked at random , and there is much more mass in all the finite clusters combined than in the infinite cluster .",
    "therefore , not only does the number of clusters increase the closer we get to the threshold , this number increases increasingly faster because the mass of the infinite cluster gets less and less .",
    "this explains the divergent behavior of the number of clusters in the standard percolation model .",
    "+ conversely , in our restricted case , we only remove sites from the infinite cluster .",
    "once we get close to the percolation threshold , the number of finite clusters we add is simply given by the number of red bonds we break on the infinite cluster .",
    "red bonds @xcite are the sites in the infinite cluster network at which two parts of the infinite cluster are only connected through a single site .",
    "perhaps this red bond breaking happens once in every four bonds we break .",
    "but whatever the ratio is in reality , it does not depend critically on how close we are to the threshold , and , therefore , the number of finite clusters that peel off should be an analytic function since the speed at which finite clusters peel off does not increase increasingly faster .",
    "we can capture the preceding conceptual reasoning in equations , which will provide us with a relationship between the critical exponent @xmath10 in the restricted and unrestricted cases . in order to distinguish between the two scenarios",
    "while keeping the number of subscripts limited , we attach a prime to the quantities in the restricted scenario .",
    "for instance , @xmath18 refers to the critical exponent for the infinite cluster in the restricted case .",
    "+ in order to setup our equations , we imagine a computer simulation where we start with a fully occupied lattice .",
    "we assign a number to every lattice site , and we roll dice to see which of these numbers is chosen for site removal . at first , we will not notice any distinction between the restricted and unrestricted cases as many sites need to be removed before isolated clusters form .",
    "but when more and more isolated clusters have formed , we will notice that sometimes we have to roll the dice again in the restricted case since a number came up that belongs to an occupied site in an isolated cluster .",
    "of course , in the unrestricted case we will simply remove this site , thereby lowering @xmath4 , before rolling again . +",
    "this imagery demonstrates two things .",
    "first , the percolation threshold will be reached at a lower value of @xmath4 in the unrestricted case versus the restricted case .",
    "second , the shape and size of the infinite cluster will go through identical points in both scenarios , the only difference being the value of @xmath4 at which these identities occur ( fig . [ pintro ] ) .",
    "thus , when we roll the dice this way , we will always be able to find a solution to the following equation for any value of @xmath4 with @xmath19 : @xmath20 since this equation holds for all values of @xmath4 , we can also relate the slope of @xmath14 to that of @xmath6 .",
    "in fact , the slope of @xmath14 will be steeper by a factor of @xmath12 than the slope of @xmath6 simply because it takes @xmath12 steps in the unrestricted case to achieve the identical demise of the infinite cluster which is achieved in one step in the restricted case .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ pintro ] and it is captured in the following equation ( with @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) : @xmath23 using eqn [ infcluster ] to describe the critical behavior of the infinite cluster in the unrestricted case , and the similar expression for the restricted case @xmath24 we can rewrite eqn [ slopes ] as follows : @xmath25 in the above equation , we ignored the terms @xmath26 and @xmath27 close to the percolation thresholds where the powerlaw terms dominate . in this approximation ,",
    "the solution to eqn [ mormor ] is given by @xmath28 substituting eqn [ solmormor ] into eqn [ slopes2 ] we find @xmath29 since this equation holds for all @xmath30 , we must have that both the prefactors , as well as the powers of @xmath30 match on either side of the equation . rearranging the terms we find @xmath31",
    "these equations readily capture that the restricted percolation model is in a different universality class .",
    "they also show that we can use the literature values for the unrestricted model to compare to our restricted case .",
    "bearing in mind that it takes ( @xmath32 more steps in the unrestricted case to achieve the same demise that the infinite cluster suffers in one step in the restricted case , we can also express the shift in percolation threshold @xmath33 between the two cases as @xmath34dp ' . \\label{pshift}\\ ] ] the integral is to be evaluated at all points for which @xmath35 , something which can not be easily done without prior knowledge of @xmath14 , but which can be used as a check in computer simulations that calculate both @xmath6 and @xmath14 at the same time . +",
    "the above equations are exact , however , we can not calculate the other critical exponents with the same rigor .",
    "critical exponents ( and observable physical quantities ) are related to the moments of the cluster distribution @xmath36 , with @xmath37 the number of clusters per site that have @xmath38 members while the summation runs over all finite sized clusters .",
    "for instance , when @xmath39 , then we can use the following sum rule to relate the exponent @xmath10 to the first moment of the @xmath37 distribution : @xmath40    we can still say something meaningful about the other moments when we make the following simplification . whenever sites become isolated from the infinite cluster , then we will have in most cases that these isolated sites peel off as one cluster .",
    "sometimes when a site is removed , it will give rise to more than one cluster peeling off provided these clusters were all linked to the infinite cluster through the same site .",
    "such events are far less common than the peeling off of just one cluster , but they do occur .",
    "when we assume that all sites that peel off from the infinite cluster end up in one single isolated cluster , then we can calculate the moments of the cluster distribution function @xmath37 .",
    "however , we do not know if we still capture the true critical behavior under this assumption .",
    "it is clear that we would underestimate the overall number of isolated clusters that we end up with ( @xmath41 ) , and that we would overestimate all moments for @xmath42 , but it is unclear if this would affect the critical exponents .",
    "+ we derive the following equation for the moments in appendix a , using the above simplification .",
    "we find that the non - analytic contributions to the moments are given by @xmath43 this equation is consistent with our earlier reasoning that the number of isolated clusters , as given by the @xmath44 moment of the above equation , does not diverge at the percolation threshold , and is in fact an analytical function of @xmath45 .",
    "this assertion is also borne out by computer simulations that we present later in this paper .",
    "the preceding discussion on the critical exponents bring us to the discussion of the so - called harris criterion . from the beginning of the study into critical phenomena",
    "it was known that an ideal system ( as described in standard percolation theory ) would undergo critical scaling @xcite as the system approached the percolation threshold .",
    "the thought initially was that a given concentration of impurities ( or defects ) would be enough to destroy the fragile scaling that was observed near the critical point : as the system approached criticality , the defects would force the system to divide up into fragmented sections that would undergo a phase transition at different temperatures .",
    "because different parts of the system would undergo this phase transition at different temperatures , the critical scaling would be lost as the divergences of correlation length , specific heat , and other critical quantities were spread out over a broad temperature scale . as described above , this",
    "would then mean that any scaling would be unrecognizable as the power law would be smeared out .",
    "+ however , after careful study , it was discovered that in the presence of small amounts of disorder @xcite the system still retains its sharp scaling behavior on approach to phase transition , provided that the system satisfied the requirement that @xmath46 , with @xmath47 the critical exponent describing the growth of the average diameter of isolated clusters and @xmath48 the dimensionality of the system .",
    "thus , if we have a system with a given amount of disorder ( through the addition of defects or impurities ) , we are able to deduce whether or not this disorder will lead to a system with a smeared or with a clean critical point and accompanying power law dependences . + for our restricted percolation scenario , we find that the harris criterion is violated .",
    "this can most easily be seen using the scaling relationship @xcite between the critical exponent @xmath49 for the number of isolated clusters and the exponent @xmath47 describing the growth in correlation : @xmath50 we can see that the harris criterion corresponds to @xmath51 . since we find analytical behavior for the number of isolated clusters ( @xmath52 ) , we find @xmath53",
    ". however , we have to bear in mind that the value of @xmath52 relied on an assumption , so we should allow for the possibility that @xmath49 equals zero .",

    "@xcite showed that a new critical point will arise in which the conventional power law scaling exists but with new exponents that satisfy the harris criterion",

    "the discovery of quantum critical systems @xcite has created a new chapter in the study of phase transitions . in quantum critical systems ,",
    "a second order phase transition is suppressed down to zero kelvin by external means such as applying pressure or magnetic fields , and the order - disorder boundary is then controlled by quantum fluctuations as opposed to thermal fluctuations .",
    "the result is that critical exponents describing such a transitions are now expected to be modified to include the dynamical scaling exponent@xcite .",
    "this changes the universality class and moves the system up to a higher effective dimension , which in turn should diminish the influence of fluctuations , perhaps even up to the point where the system surpasses the upper critical dimension and fluctuations are only marginally important .",
    "however , despite these obvious truths , the critical exponents regarding such transitions have not been worked out@xcite .",
    "in fact , it is unclear whether universal behavior even occurs in quantum critical systems : it might well be the case that intrinsic disorder@xcite ultimately determines the critical behavior .",
    "+ the second order transition that has been studied most extensively @xcite is the magnetic ordering that takes place in kondo lattice systems .",
    "such systems have magnetic ions embedded into the unit cell , and upon cooling down , these magnetic ions tend to align with the neighbors .",

    "depends very sensitively on the atomic separation between the magnetic ions and the non - magnetic ions .",

    "one substitutes smaller ( larger ) ions for the ions already present , thereby shrinking ( expanding ) the lattice , resulting in a stronger ( weaker ) coupling .",
    "an example of this process is substituting ru ions on fe - sites in cefe@xmath56ge@xmath56 , resulting in a system that will order magnetically once @xmath8024.6% of the fe - ions have been substituted @xcite",
    ". many more examples of systems that have been driven to exhibit an order - disorder transition at 0 k can be found in the review by stewart @xcite .",
    "+ chemical substitution introduces disorder , but , more importantly , it introduces a distribution of temperatures below which individual magnetic ions will be shielded by the conduction electrons . on a microscopic level in the doped system",
    ", we will find a distribution of spacings between the outer shells of neighboring magnetic and non - magnetic ions , resulting in a distribution of coupling strengths between the magnetic moments and the conduction electrons @xcite .",
    "this in turn implies that when such a substituted system is cooled down , that some magnetic ions will be shielded while others might survive down to lower temperatures , or even resist shielding altogether .",
    "+ the consequence of this substitution is a percolative system in which magnetic moments disappear through shielding upon cooling . which moments disappear first is determined at random since the chemical substitution will have taken place in random unit cells . if enough moments survive down to temperatures where the moments line up , then we will encounter long - range magnetic ordering .",
    "if too few survive , then long - range order will not materialize .",
    "the critical composition would be given by there still , but only barely , being an infinite cluster present at 0 k. + the percolation described in the preceding paragraphs is an unavoidable consequence of chemical substitution in combination with the underlying physics of the shielding process ( namely , the very sensitive dependence on interatomic distances ) .",
    "however , what is described is standard percolation , not the restricted model that we introduced in the preceding sections . for the latter",
    ", we also need to consider the importance of finite size effects .",
    "+ when we cool down a chemically substituted system , some moments will be shielded while others survive .",
    "when we cool down further , we will find that groups of surviving moments will become isolated from the remainder of the moments because they find themselves surrounded by shielded moments .",
    "when that happens , the moments within such an isolated cluster will align with their neighbors because of finite size effects .",
    "these effects are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ finite ] .",
    "essentially , it takes a certain amount of energy to keep moments from being ordered . normally , above the ordering transition temperature , the thermal energy is sufficient to create so many excitations ( spin - waves ) that the moments will point in random directions . for small clusters , however ,",
    "a finite amount of energy is required because ( as quantum mechanics tells us ) the disordering fluctuation can not have a wavelength that is longer than twice the size of the cluster .",
    "shorter wavelength excitations require more energy , and the energy requirements will be so large ( see fig .",
    "[ finite ] ) that they can not be met by the available thermal energy close to 0 k. as a result , the moments on small clusters are forced to order .",
    "+     listed at the top of the figure ) are shown by the vertical lines .",
    "for example , at @xmath81= 20 k clusters of linear size 64 @xmath82 and smaller would order since not enough thermal energy would be available to start a disordering fluctuation with the maximum wavelength ( minimum energy ) @xmath83.[finite ] ]    when the moments are aligned in a kondo system , then the kondo shielding mechanism will be rendered ineffective since this mechanism involves the spin flip of a conduction electron @xcite .",
    "this latter process is severely impeded in magnetically ordered surroundings .",
    "therefore , once clusters split off from the infinite cluster , basic quantum mechanics dictates that the moments must order , thereby impeding the kondo shielding mechanism . as a result ,",
    "the moments of isolated clusters become impervious to being removed , and we end up with a restricted percolation model where moments can only be shielded ( removed ) on the magnetically disordered infinite cluster .",
    "+ the quantum critical system ce(ru@xmath84fe@xmath85)@xmath56ge@xmath56 that we alluded to before provides a good example of the shielding and cluster formation processes described above . when this system is cooled down , neutron scattering experiments @xcite reveal the formation of clusters and the ordering of the moments of the cluster members , as shown in fig .",
    "[ qcp2 ] . upon further cooling",
    ", additional clusters are formed , which also order the instant they separate from the infinite cluster . the experimental evidence for this is outlined in fig .",

    "has since been inferred from uniform susceptibility measurements on various ferromagnetic quantum critical systems @xcite and has been suggested for almost stoichiometric compounds@xcite .",

    "+    [ t ]    fe@xmath85)@xmath56ge@xmath56 , measured by means of neutron scattering @xcite .",
    "one observes that the magnetic scattering starts to emerge at 16 k , and increases in intensity while narrowing in width in q - space when we cool down more . since the inverse of this width is directly proportional to the distance over which moments",
    "are correlated , we see that ( for all temperatures ) there are just as many moments lined up along the c - direction ( red symbols , momentum transfer along the ( 00@xmath86)-direction ) as there are along another high symmetry direction ( black symbols , momentum transfer along the ( @xmath870)-direction ) . in this system , where the lengths of the a and c axes differ by a factor of 2.5 , this must be indicative of clusters that are formed by random removal of magnetic moments .",
    "the curves have been offset along the vertical axis .",
    "panel ( b ) displays the same data along the ( 00@xmath86)-direction , but now plotted on top of each other .",
    "note the change in scale on the vertical axis . when the data are plotted this way one can observe that once clusters form and order , that this ordering remains intact upon cooling .",
    "when the temperature is lowered further , one observes that new ( and larger , as implied by the narrower width ) clusters form , and that the scattering by these clusters augments the scattering of the clusters already present .",
    "panel ( a ) has been reproduced from w. montfrooij _",
    "b76 , 052404 ( 2007).[qcp2 ] ]    in short , we have reasoned that restricted percolation should be relevant to chemically doped materials that undergo moment shielding upon cooling , while experiments have shown both the existence of clusters in such materials , as well as the moment alignment within isolated clusters .",
    "as such , it would seem highly likely that the response of such systems will reflect the presence of such clusters and the underlying percolative nature of the problem .",
    "for instance , the evolution of the specific heat with changing temperature should reflect the loss of entropy when the moments on a cluster are forced to order .",
    "the susceptibility should reflect whether isolated clusters have a net moment , and how easy it is for this net moment to be flipped .",
    "close to the order - disorder transition , the temperature dependence of such quantities should be determined by the critical behavior inherent in the restricted percolative model . as such , studying this new set of models should help in understanding the unusual response of certain quantum critical systems , and perhaps even bring us closer to explaining why thus far these systems have eluded a full theoretical description .",
    "+ we end this section with two remarks .",
    "first , the above strictly applies only to quantum critical systems that have been driven to criticality through chemical doping .",
    "we have argued elsewhere @xcite that the restricted percolative model might also be relevant to stoichiometric systems , but that relevance requires a few more assumptions than the basic reasoning employed in this paper .",
    "+ second , it is not possible to directly relate the observed powerlaws in quantum critical systems to those of the restricted percolation model .",
    "the powerlaws in percolation are given as a function of site occupancy , whereas the experimental powerlaws are measured as a function of temperature .",
    "the missing link is the distribution function of exactly at what temperature a particular moment will be shielded .",
    "we will discuss such a distribution function @xcite in a forthcoming paper where we describe the observed response of ce(ru@xmath84fe@xmath85)@xmath56ge@xmath56 in terms of an underlying distribution of shielding temperatures in conjunction with the restricted percolation model .",
    "+ in summary , we have discussed a restricted version of the standard percolation model .",
    "we have argued that this model bears direct relevance to the behavior of quantum critical system .",
    "we have derived relationships between the critical exponents in this restricted model and the exponents in the standard percolation model .",
    "we have verified by means of computer simulations that these derived relationships are correct , implying that our restricted model represents a new universality class .",

    "we are most thankful to thomas vojta for the many discussions regarding the validity of our restricted percolation model .",
    "in this appendix we derive eqn [ moments ] under the assumption that whenever sites peel off from the infinite cluster that they all end up being part of a new single isolated cluster , rather than allowing for the possibility that multiple clusters peel off .",
    "+ when a moment is removed from the infinite cluster , we can have two possible outcomes : either the infinite cluster loses one member , or a finite - sized cluster peels off from the infinite cluster . in the latter case",
    "the infinite cluster loses @xmath88 members , and a new isolated cluster is created with @xmath89 members .",
    "thus , at every percolation step @xmath90 that resulted in a change @xmath91 in the infinite cluster membership probability , we find for the change in cluster moment distribution upon removing sites : @xmath92 where the factor @xmath13 arises because @xmath37 is the number of clusters with @xmath38 members _ per lattice site_. given that @xmath93 equals @xmath94 since @xmath95 , this leads to @xmath96^{k}.\\ ] ] using @xmath97 and integrating the above equation we obtain @xmath98 note that this equation only includes the singular part ; the analytic part @xcite , if existent , has been omitted .",
